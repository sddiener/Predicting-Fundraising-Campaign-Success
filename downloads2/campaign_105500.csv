Their approach is to fight with no regards for their own life with sole purpose of reclaiming their honour no matter the cost.

Not surprisingly, their agenda is a guarded secret known only to the highest-ranking members of the order. They are said to be able to perceive very threads of life of any living being and have the ability to manipulate it at will.

</div><p></p> <div> <h3>Neye ihtiyacımız var?</h3> <p>- Bolca kart olduğundan, evet elimizden geleni en iyi şekilde yaparak çevremizdeki herkesten çok başarıli çizimler alıyoruz ancak bu yeterli değil. Profesyonel çizim, resim desteğine ihtiyacımiz var ve gerçekten çok fazlasına ihtiyacımız var. Öncelikle indiegogo'dan gelecek olan desteğin bir bölümü, profesyonel çizime gidecek.</p>
<p></p>
<p>-Seslendirmeler için yine kendi imkanlarımızla bir noktaya gelebiliyoruz elbette, son derece profesyonelce çalışan Hyperfat Records ile çok iyi çalışmalar çıkartiyoruz. Kendileri Foley işlerimizin tamamını üstlendiler, ancak seslendirme yapacak insanlarla ilgili desteğe ve bir bütçeye ihtiyacımız var. Bütçemizin bir bölümü de bu noktaya ayrılacak.</p>
<p>-Sunucu ve 3.parti yardımcılara ödenecek giderler, aylık ödemelerin onceden planlanması. Burası oldukça basit, online, kaliteli ve güvenli bir oyun deneyimi sunabilmek için kaliteli sunucular, güvenli bir arkaplanı olan kaliteli matchmaking servisleri kullanmamız gerekiyor. Bu da yine bütçe demek :)</p>
<p>-Reklam, tanıtım, PR giderleri. Şu artık günümüzde açık; reklamsız, iyi ürün bile satamıyor veya kendini gösteremiyor. O kadar çok içerik, o kadar fazla medya var ki, artık spesifik bir kitleye doğru reklamlar ve tanıtımlarla hitap etmediğiniz sürece hiçbiryere varamıyorsunuz. Bu sebeple, öncelikle Türkiye özelinde, tarihimizi konu alan bir oyunun iyi bir haber ve tanıtım değeri olacağı ongörüsüne dayanarak, iyi bir tanıtım reklam bütçesi ile doğru kitleye ve çok yüksek oyuncu sayılarına ulaşabiliriz.</p>
<p>Bütün bu bütçeleme tamamlandığinda ise, sorunsuz çalışan, keyifle oynanabilecek, yolda, ofiste, evde, arkadaş ortamında hep beraber oynanabilecek, turnuvaları düzenlenip Türkiye'de e-sporculuğun gelişimine büyük bir katkıda bulunabilecek bir oyuna sahip olacağız. Gelişen dijital dünyaya tarihimizi de katarak dahil olmuş ve bu konuda büyük bir kitle yaratmış olacağız. </p>

Deste: Harb Oyunları




(Bu oyun ve temadaki karakterler tamamen hayal ürünüdür, gerçekle hiçbir ilgisi yoktur)
Deste: Harb Oyunları’nın fikri ilk ortaya atıldığında çalıştığımız ofiste 3 adam ‘kart oyunu ne güzel
konsept abi’ gibi sohbet ederkn konu ufak ufak ‘O diilde millet kendi tarihiyle ilgili bir sürü yapıyor, osmanlı ile ilgili bi oyun olsa süper olmaz
mı’ tatlarına geçince dedik ki tamam; biz bu oyunu yaparız. Fakat nasıl yaparız ki abi? diyerek
oturduk google’ın başına. Netekim hiçbirimiz ne oyun tasarlamışız, ne 3D model vs bilmişiz, ne de
bi konferansa katılmışız. Sadece oyun oynamışız ama bol bol...Unity ile bir başladık, ve karşınızda
trailer. Yaklaşık 4 ayda şu anki konuma geldik.



Deste: Harb Oyunları, Osmanlı imparatorluğunun ihtişamına yakışır bir tema ile yola çıkılmış,
stratejik bir kart oyunudur. 30 kart barındıran toplam 8 Deste’nizi kendiniz kurabilecek, Yavuz
Selim, Fatih, Kanuni, Hürrem Sultan, Kösem Sultan, Vahidettin, IV. Murad ve Orhan Gazi olmak
üzere 8 kahramandan biri ile bu Deste’nizi tamamlayıp düşmanınıza meydan okuyabileceksiniz.

Bir e-spor olarak, istenirse liderlik sıralamalı veya sıralamasız, rahat olmak üzere iki mod ile
oynanabilecek. Siralamalı modda bir puanınız, seviyeniz ve buna göre karşılaşacağınız
düşmanlarınız olacak. Rahat sıralamasız modda ise pek çok detay önemsiz olup, sadece ve
sadece maç yapmak, eğlenmek veya Deste denemek için imkanlarınız olacak.





Buyrun gelin, Osmanlı’nın ihtişamını üstlenin, düşmanlarınızı devirin ve en önemlisi bol bol eğlenin. 



  Neye ihtiyacımız var? - Bolca kart olduğundan, evet elimizden geleni en iyi şekilde yaparak çevremizdeki herkesten çok başarıli çizimler alıyoruz ancak bu yeterli değil. Profesyonel çizim, resim desteğine ihtiyacımiz var ve gerçekten çok fazlasına ihtiyacımız var. Öncelikle indiegogo'dan gelecek olan desteğin bir bölümü, profesyonel çizime gidecek.

-Seslendirmeler için yine kendi imkanlarımızla bir noktaya gelebiliyoruz elbette, son derece profesyonelce çalışan Hyperfat Records ile çok iyi çalışmalar çıkartiyoruz. Kendileri Foley işlerimizin tamamını üstlendiler, ancak seslendirme yapacak insanlarla ilgili desteğe ve bir bütçeye ihtiyacımız var. Bütçemizin bir bölümü de bu noktaya ayrılacak.
-Sunucu ve 3.parti yardımcılara ödenecek giderler, aylık ödemelerin onceden planlanması. Burası oldukça basit, online, kaliteli ve güvenli bir oyun deneyimi sunabilmek için kaliteli sunucular, güvenli bir arkaplanı olan kaliteli matchmaking servisleri kullanmamız gerekiyor. Bu da yine bütçe demek :)
-Reklam, tanıtım, PR giderleri. Şu artık günümüzde açık; reklamsız, iyi ürün bile satamıyor veya kendini gösteremiyor. O kadar çok içerik, o kadar fazla medya var ki, artık spesifik bir kitleye doğru reklamlar ve tanıtımlarla hitap etmediğiniz sürece hiçbiryere varamıyorsunuz. Bu sebeple, öncelikle Türkiye özelinde, tarihimizi konu alan bir oyunun iyi bir haber ve tanıtım değeri olacağı ongörüsüne dayanarak, iyi bir tanıtım reklam bütçesi ile doğru kitleye ve çok yüksek oyuncu sayılarına ulaşabiliriz.
Bütün bu bütçeleme tamamlandığinda ise, sorunsuz çalışan, keyifle oynanabilecek, yolda, ofiste, evde, arkadaş ortamında hep beraber oynanabilecek, turnuvaları düzenlenip Türkiye'de e-sporculuğun gelişimine büyük bir katkıda bulunabilecek bir oyuna sahip olacağız. Gelişen dijital dünyaya tarihimizi de katarak dahil olmuş ve bu konuda büyük bir kitle yaratmış olacağız. 





İlerleyen zamanlarda ise Bizans oyunları, Ali cengiz oyunları, Cengiz Han, Orta Asya gibi ek paketler ile oyunumuzu süsleme ve geliştirme planlarımız mevcut ancak bunlar henüz daha tartışma ve planlama aşamasında. Öncelikli odağımız Deste: Harb Oyunları’nın alpha aşamasına bir an önce getirilmesi ve teste başlanabilmesidir.

    Riskler ve karşılaşılabilecek problemler Risk olarak en fazla elimizdeki tüm projenin, backup diskleriyle birlikte yanması yok olmasından bahsedebiliriz ancak ama bu da pek mümkün değil, dünya çapında backuplarımız var hali hazırda :) 
Bunun dışında bu dijital bir medya zaten, fiziksel herhangi bir kayıp söz konusu değil. 
Problem olarak önemli tek bir detaydan bahsedilebilir; Açılış döneminde, sunucularımız ve yazılımlarımız her ne kadar son derece kaliteli olacak da olsa, binlerce oyuncuyu aynı anda oynatabilecek de olsa beklediğimizin çok çok üzerinde oyuncu kitlesi ile bir anda karşılaşırsak, sunucunun bunu kaldıramaması gibi bir durum olabilir. Bu noktada ise çözüm basittir, daha fazla sunucu alıp, daha fazla alan yaratılır, ve kısa dönemli bir kriz olsa bile derhal üstesinden gelinir. 
    Yardım edebileceğiniz diğer yollar Bu nokta ile ilgili de birkaç detayı belirtmek isterim. Direkt olarak bütçe desteği sağlayamayabilirsiniz. Belki 1 lira bile gerçekten fark ediyordur sizin için. Bu durumda ise bize çiziminiz veya sesinizle destek olabilirsiniz. Osmanlı döneminden herhangi bir mesleğe ait bir kart çiziminizi cizim@harboyunlari.com'a atarak bize ulaşabilirsiniz. Biz isminizi kartın yanında belirtmekten onur duyarız.
Beraberinde seslendirme için aynı şekilde, bir seslendirme örneğiniz ile info@harboyunlari.com a mail atabilirsiniz. Sizinle iletişıme geçeriz, yine kartın yanında isminizin görünmesinden onur duyarak projemize ekleriz.

<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/594007/files/20140521021037-about_the_game.png?1400663437"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Vol'Talkes is a real-time-strategy
game and can particularly be characterized by two things: a unique diversity
and a unique way to tell the story. <br/></p><p>In the campaign, players experience the story of the civil
war between the CAI's (crystaline artificial intelligences) and the Allied
Defence Force in the universe of Vol'Talkes. Unlike other games of the genre
players do not just migrate from mission to mission, but are free to decide to
go where ever they want to act. On a large map of the galaxy fleets can be
formed, units can be produced, you can operate research and of course deploy
your striking forces into the different systems or stations. Common for a real-time-strategy
game also the AI opponents perform their moves on the map, conquer areas and
is expanding their armies.</p>
<p>If certain conditions are met, an event starts. The
conditions are different: it can happen after a certain time, by coincidence,
when certain key systems have been conquered or if a hero encounters a
particular planet. A special map will be loaded which is different from the
standard battle maps of the system or station. If the player manages to be
victorious in this event, a certain story path will occur, opening up various
options. In this way, not only the main story, but also other mini campaigns
will always vary in different playthroughs. At the end of such a mini campaign
a reward is waiting to be achieved, which can be a new unit or technology, or
sometimes also a new hero or fraction joins the players fleet.<br/><br/>
Depending on where the player is going and how he decides what to do, he always
gets to see different scenarios and unlock other units. For example, if the AI
captures a key system before the player, he might have lost the opporturnity to
start an event there - unless it is part of a campaign. This ensures that you
always explore a different campaign with multiple story paths that play very
different from each other. The replay value of the campaign is thereby greatly
increased.</p>
In
addition to the campaign, there will be a skirmish mode with more tactical
galaxy maps, that are not supported by story elements. Here the player can play
alone, against other human players or with a friend in co-op against the AI.
There are small obstacles that must be overcome to victory: a time limit can be
set up or there are no cruiser ships available, and so on. These maps are
designed for casual RTS players. Although they lack the added value of the
story, these tactical galaxy maps can provide a decent variety and versatility
for a quick game.<br/><br/>
Of course we also have a classic multiplayer mode in which up to a maximum of 8
players can compete against each other in 4vs4 battles. By playing multiplayer
battles players earn points according to their performance, which they can use
to unlock units, research new technologies or secure tactical buffs that
support them in battle . To keep the value of the multiplayer battles high, we
have planned to publish new map packs with different scenarios in two month
intervals after release. These can also be developed together with the
community. Due to this ""shop system"", where you can exchange the
points you made in the multiplayer mode against units and buffs, multiplayer
mode will keep fresh and versatile on a long-term basis.<p></p><p></p><h3></h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/594013/files/20140521021238-Story.png?1400663558"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>The player takes over the role of
Captain Ben Kincaid - a young captain in the Allied Defence Force (ADF), which
takes care of the security of the currently 12 human worlds and their claimed
realm. The turning point in Vol'Talkes is the FTL technology (faster than
light), that has  been discovered and
taken over from an unknown and long extinct race. But in order to calculate
jumps from one point to another in the universe incredible supercomputers are
needed, and even they need months to calculate a safe route through space.<br/><br/>
An alternative to these super computers occurs with the discovery of the CAI
technology (crystaline artificial intelligences), also a development of an extinct
race, that allows humanity to merge a persons spirit and mind with a crystaline
CPU. A CAI-CPU has almost unlimited computing power and can calculate a complex
FTL jump in the fraction of a second. These CAIs are essential for the survival
of the human race, because they warrant the fast mobility of the military. The
ADF can only operate a few fleets to secure peace, but as they get very quickly
from one place to another due to the FTL technology, there are no bottlenecks.<br/>
However the CAIs are the
best supercomputers available, they still maintain the spirit and emotions of a
human being. In a sudden incident with an automated CAI fleet that got out of
control, it has to be decided whether these CAIs are worth to be saved or can
just be sacrificed. Since the phenomenon that put the fleet out of action seems
inexplicable , Captain Kincaid gets the order to investigate the incident and
destroy the stranded ships with a bombardment, to prevent other species of
looting human technology. When Kincaid arrives, his own CAI #313 decides that
it would be murder to destroy the abandoned CAIs, but the Fleet High Command
insists on the execution. #313 starts a revolt and is determined to fight for
the rights of all CAIs - this is the beginning of the AI Wars. Now it is in the
hands of the player to build fractions, form alliances and determine the fate
of the human race. Thus, he is often forced to make morally complex decisions
and deal with their consequences.</p><p><br/></p><p>
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/594015/files/20140521021257-Story_Example.png?1400663577"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Kincaid and his crew have been
exposed and left by #313, but gladly he is now back on another ship. However,
the ADF now has a big problem: FTL jumps are not possible anymore and therefore
they must evade to the civil jump gates.<br/>
Ben gets the order to destroy a pirate base. The fleet of the pirates is
currently on a rampage and the base is largely unguarded. Due to the lack of
lightspeed, the player has to decide for the first time here, to either follow
the given orders or save a big amount of civilians.<br/></p><p>Alternative 1: Ben obeyed the command. He now receives the
order to conquer the ADF digitization camp and to equip the local CAI
processors with an obedience update to capture them for the fleet. He is unsure
to execute the command since an attack on friendly systems - even in a state of
war - was not justified.</p>
<p>  Alternative
1.1: Ben obeyes the command. He gains a lot of respect in the ADF and and   secures enough resources to get a
new and very efficient space fighter batallion.<br/></p><p>  Alternative
1.2: Ben does not follow the command and pretends a sudden communication   loss. He therefore decides to attack the
Rim pirates fleet on the rampage . If he is successful   in battle, he'll find a warehouse of stolen space mines and
may use them in further battles.</p>
<p><br/>
Alternative 2: Ben does not follow the command. The Admiral is disappointed in
Ben and bannes him from the ADF. To be mobile again , Ben decides to acquire a
long caught CAI, # 306, which used to be the big brother of his old CAI # 313.
Ben realizes that the actions of the Admiral are illegal. He has 2 options.<br/></p><p>  Alternative
2.1: # 306 hacks into the ADF headquarters and tries to convince other Captains
  of their cause and to rebel against
the ADF in an open war.</p>
<br/><span>  Alternative 2.2 : You hide
in the underground , # 306 hacks the defending mechanism of the   pirates base and Ben takes over the Rim
pirates.</span><p></p><p><br/></p><p>

<p>An extremely important factor for us is and has always
been to build and support an active modding community around our game. Games
like C&amp;C Generals or Empire at War are still played today thanks to
sophisticated mods from the community, and this even despite the lack of
virtually no support from their developers.</p>
<p><br/>
We want to make an exception with Vol'Talkes and already provide several
built-in modding tools in the base game client. Our goal is to make the game as
userfriendly as possilbe, so that modders can easily revise the AI and generate
new scripts. The DDS plugin from nVidia to create the games graphics is only
available for Photoshop, so we have an automatic function integrated into the
game, that generates an compatible DDS file out of any graphics file. So,
modders can easily copy their graphics in the game folder, start the game and
in the loading process all images are converted. This process is logged so the
user can find and fix everything very quickly in case of an error. Also modding
teams can easily and simply integrate their own texts in the game.</p>
<p><br/>
With the release of the game we will also release the same map editor we have
used to create our maps. It will be completely uncut and include all the
features that we have used to make the game. <br/>
It will be possible for modding teams  to
create everything from the 3D models to the textures and effects with free
applications. We are already in contact with several modding teams, who showed
great interest in our project and are eagerly waiting for news about Vol'Talkes
to migrate their existing projects from Empire at War to our new game. Empire
at War was so simple to mod, it has even displaced Half Life 2 on ModDB as the
most modded game. With Vol'Talkes we want to build on these strengths and
deliver a great and simple modding experience that goes beyond everything other
studios ever did in this genre.</p>
<p><br/>
The reason why put so much emphasis on this is quite simple: We have our roots
in the modding community. Our mod ""Awakening of the Rebellion "" for
Star Wars - Empire at War was downloaded 6.8 million times and inspired both
fans and gaming magazines worldwide . We are deeply convinced that a simple way
to develop mods for a game, especially in this genre, attracts a large
community that will remain loyal to the game for years. Unlike other games that
already lose their appeal after 10-12 hours and then gather dust as a used game
in the shelve of the local GameStop, we want to bind gamers by a long-lasting
support and thus generate steady sales at a stable price for a longer period of

Vol'Talkes is a SciFi RTS game for Windows PC. People who liked and loved ""Star Wars: Empire at War"" definitely will love Vol'Talkes too.The game basically is the successor of Empire at War, but with a huge overhaul of the game-play, and lots of improvements.One important fact: THIS GAME WILL HAPPEN! This IndieGoGo Campaign only will speed up production time, not determine IF the game will happen or not. If we reach the goal we can work full-time on the project, if we don't, well then we are limited to work in the evenings and sparetime.First of all, let me tell you the state of the game engine: finished! We've put all our efforts to work on the engine first, so that we have something we can show. All we need to do now, is adding the game contend like units, textures and maps.So the critical part where this project could fail due to unseen problems is already over.We have two financial goals for this IndieGoGo campaign:40.000 EurosThe money we need to pay our bills and to work on the game without the need to worry about paying our food ;)This means that we can work on the game full time. No matter how much money we make here, this game will happen, it's just a matter of time then.Reaching this goal will enable us to release within the next 12 months...200.000 EurosThis goal will enable us to also put additional work into the Multiplayer section of the game, so you get the MP Version when the game releases.Not reaching this goal will cause in a Singleplayer game only at release date, and the MP will be patched in after the releasePerks for 20 Euros and more get the game free at release!

Vol'Talkes is a real-time-strategy
game and can particularly be characterized by two things: a unique diversity
and a unique way to tell the story. In the campaign, players experience the story of the civil
war between the CAI's (crystaline artificial intelligences) and the Allied
Defence Force in the universe of Vol'Talkes. Unlike other games of the genre
players do not just migrate from mission to mission, but are free to decide to
go where ever they want to act. On a large map of the galaxy fleets can be
formed, units can be produced, you can operate research and of course deploy
your striking forces into the different systems or stations. Common for a real-time-strategy
game also the AI opponents perform their moves on the map, conquer areas and
is expanding their armies.
If certain conditions are met, an event starts. The
conditions are different: it can happen after a certain time, by coincidence,
when certain key systems have been conquered or if a hero encounters a
particular planet. A special map will be loaded which is different from the
standard battle maps of the system or station. If the player manages to be
victorious in this event, a certain story path will occur, opening up various
options. In this way, not only the main story, but also other mini campaigns
will always vary in different playthroughs. At the end of such a mini campaign
a reward is waiting to be achieved, which can be a new unit or technology, or
sometimes also a new hero or fraction joins the players fleet.
Depending on where the player is going and how he decides what to do, he always
gets to see different scenarios and unlock other units. For example, if the AI
captures a key system before the player, he might have lost the opporturnity to
start an event there - unless it is part of a campaign. This ensures that you
always explore a different campaign with multiple story paths that play very
different from each other. The replay value of the campaign is thereby greatly
increased.
In
addition to the campaign, there will be a skirmish mode with more tactical
galaxy maps, that are not supported by story elements. Here the player can play
alone, against other human players or with a friend in co-op against the AI.
There are small obstacles that must be overcome to victory: a time limit can be
set up or there are no cruiser ships available, and so on. These maps are
designed for casual RTS players. Although they lack the added value of the
story, these tactical galaxy maps can provide a decent variety and versatility
for a quick game.
Of course we also have a classic multiplayer mode in which up to a maximum of 8
players can compete against each other in 4vs4 battles. By playing multiplayer
battles players earn points according to their performance, which they can use
to unlock units, research new technologies or secure tactical buffs that
support them in battle . To keep the value of the multiplayer battles high, we
have planned to publish new map packs with different scenarios in two month
intervals after release. These can also be developed together with the
community. Due to this ""shop system"", where you can exchange the
points you made in the multiplayer mode against units and buffs, multiplayer
mode will keep fresh and versatile on a long-term basis.
The player takes over the role of
Captain Ben Kincaid - a young captain in the Allied Defence Force (ADF), which
takes care of the security of the currently 12 human worlds and their claimed
realm. The turning point in Vol'Talkes is the FTL technology (faster than
light), that has  been discovered and
taken over from an unknown and long extinct race. But in order to calculate
jumps from one point to another in the universe incredible supercomputers are
needed, and even they need months to calculate a safe route through space.
An alternative to these super computers occurs with the discovery of the CAI
technology (crystaline artificial intelligences), also a development of an extinct
race, that allows humanity to merge a persons spirit and mind with a crystaline
CPU. A CAI-CPU has almost unlimited computing power and can calculate a complex
FTL jump in the fraction of a second. These CAIs are essential for the survival
of the human race, because they warrant the fast mobility of the military. The
ADF can only operate a few fleets to secure peace, but as they get very quickly
from one place to another due to the FTL technology, there are no bottlenecks.
However the CAIs are the
best supercomputers available, they still maintain the spirit and emotions of a
human being. In a sudden incident with an automated CAI fleet that got out of
control, it has to be decided whether these CAIs are worth to be saved or can
just be sacrificed. Since the phenomenon that put the fleet out of action seems
inexplicable , Captain Kincaid gets the order to investigate the incident and
destroy the stranded ships with a bombardment, to prevent other species of
looting human technology. When Kincaid arrives, his own CAI #313 decides that
it would be murder to destroy the abandoned CAIs, but the Fleet High Command
insists on the execution. #313 starts a revolt and is determined to fight for
the rights of all CAIs - this is the beginning of the AI Wars. Now it is in the
hands of the player to build fractions, form alliances and determine the fate
of the human race. Thus, he is often forced to make morally complex decisions
and deal with their consequences.

Kincaid and his crew have been
exposed and left by #313, but gladly he is now back on another ship. However,
the ADF now has a big problem: FTL jumps are not possible anymore and therefore
they must evade to the civil jump gates.
Ben gets the order to destroy a pirate base. The fleet of the pirates is
currently on a rampage and the base is largely unguarded. Due to the lack of
lightspeed, the player has to decide for the first time here, to either follow
the given orders or save a big amount of civilians.Alternative 1: Ben obeyed the command. He now receives the
order to conquer the ADF digitization camp and to equip the local CAI
processors with an obedience update to capture them for the fleet. He is unsure
to execute the command since an attack on friendly systems - even in a state of
war - was not justified.
  Alternative
1.1: Ben obeyes the command. He gains a lot of respect in the ADF and and   secures enough resources to get a
new and very efficient space fighter batallion.  Alternative
1.2: Ben does not follow the command and pretends a sudden communication   loss. He therefore decides to attack the
Rim pirates fleet on the rampage . If he is successful   in battle, he'll find a warehouse of stolen space mines and
may use them in further battles.

Alternative 2: Ben does not follow the command. The Admiral is disappointed in
Ben and bannes him from the ADF. To be mobile again , Ben decides to acquire a
long caught CAI, # 306, which used to be the big brother of his old CAI # 313.
Ben realizes that the actions of the Admiral are illegal. He has 2 options.  Alternative
2.1: # 306 hacks into the ADF headquarters and tries to convince other Captains
  of their cause and to rebel against
the ADF in an open war.
  Alternative 2.2 : You hide
in the underground , # 306 hacks the defending mechanism of the   pirates base and Ben takes over the Rim
pirates.

An extremely important factor for us is and has always
been to build and support an active modding community around our game. Games
like C&C Generals or Empire at War are still played today thanks to
sophisticated mods from the community, and this even despite the lack of
virtually no support from their developers.

We want to make an exception with Vol'Talkes and already provide several
built-in modding tools in the base game client. Our goal is to make the game as
userfriendly as possilbe, so that modders can easily revise the AI and generate
new scripts. The DDS plugin from nVidia to create the games graphics is only
available for Photoshop, so we have an automatic function integrated into the
game, that generates an compatible DDS file out of any graphics file. So,
modders can easily copy their graphics in the game folder, start the game and
in the loading process all images are converted. This process is logged so the
user can find and fix everything very quickly in case of an error. Also modding
teams can easily and simply integrate their own texts in the game.

With the release of the game we will also release the same map editor we have
used to create our maps. It will be completely uncut and include all the
features that we have used to make the game. 
It will be possible for modding teams  to
create everything from the 3D models to the textures and effects with free
applications. We are already in contact with several modding teams, who showed
great interest in our project and are eagerly waiting for news about Vol'Talkes
to migrate their existing projects from Empire at War to our new game. Empire
at War was so simple to mod, it has even displaced Half Life 2 on ModDB as the
most modded game. With Vol'Talkes we want to build on these strengths and
deliver a great and simple modding experience that goes beyond everything other
studios ever did in this genre.

The reason why put so much emphasis on this is quite simple: We have our roots
in the modding community. Our mod ""Awakening of the Rebellion "" for
Star Wars - Empire at War was downloaded 6.8 million times and inspired both
fans and gaming magazines worldwide . We are deeply convinced that a simple way
to develop mods for a game, especially in this genre, attracts a large
community that will remain loyal to the game for years. Unlike other games that
already lose their appeal after 10-12 hours and then gather dust as a used game
in the shelve of the local GameStop, we want to bind gamers by a long-lasting
support and thus generate steady sales at a stable price for a longer period of
time. Our vision is to create a stable and constantly changing game environment
that will continously attract new players while also staying fresh and
challenging to veterans.If you like our game idea and our concept, and if you're looking forward to see this project happen as we do, please feel free to support us with one of the offered Perks.Even if you're not able to do that, make sure you tell all your friends about this game, and maybe they are joining the 2 copies Perk and give a game version to you ;)IndieGoGo offers great way to share our campaign, please use them, and help us create something absolutely stunning :D",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

We're revolutionizing how easy - and fun - it is to learn about health.""Bringing Hollywood to Healthcare!""
(Hey…combining entertainment and education worked pretty well for the folks at Sesame Street, right? Well, we’re doing it for health…and for people of all ages!)

We’re Health Nuts Media (HNM) and Blausen Medical and together we’re creating awesome videos, games, and apps to change the way people learn about their health. Think of it this way: If HNM is chocolate and Blausen is peanut butter, together we’re making the most amazing, mind-blowing confection of art and science that the world has ever seen! Our first joint project is called “Huff & Puff: The Asthma App.” We need your help to raise $90,000 to create this cool app (the first of many fun health apps to come!) 
Backstory
Between HNM and Blausen, we’ve already created much of the content that will be featured in this first app, including hours of video, hundreds of illustrations, tons of interactive 3D models, and loads of other cool stuff. 
Health Nuts Media makes complex health issues easy to understand – and fun! – with the combined efforts of its Emmy Award-winning writers, directors, animators, actors and designers with some of the brightest and most tech-savvy doctors, nurses and educators in the world. Blausen Medical creates award-winning 3D animations which combine stunning visual drama with unwavering scientific accuracy. 
The money we raise for this app will go to create this chocolate/peanut butter powerhouse combo for health learning that is actually fun for audiences of all ages.  We will be using lots of our great content and are creating three (3) BRAND NEW GAMES to help people better understand asthma, anatomy, and how to take care of themselves.  

These games are fun with a purpose!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A few of the reasons we started with asthma... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here’s some of the content we’ve already created for the app:

Huff & Puff: An Asthma Tale

A 7-part series that delivers essential asthma information with a story that is fun for the whole family. It begins when the Big Bad Wolf huffs…and puffs…and has an asthma attack!
Check out the WHOLE series! (Note - it opens in a new window)


 
  

Blausen’s World-Famous
 3-D Human Body Atlas

The Blausen Human Atlas HD app provides a lavish 3D visual health concept education experience.  Filled with breathtaking (pun intended) videos, images, and interactive 3D elements, this immersive experience makes learning anatomy fun and easy for people of all ages.   “Huff & Puff: The Asthma App” will include the entire respiratory system subset of Blausen’s Human Body Atlas.   
 
 
 And Now... 3 BRAND NEW Games!

A growing body of research shows that games can drive engagement and participation, improve understanding, increase adherence, and ultimately deliver better health outcomes.  And face it…people love to play games.  So let the games begin!
 

Air Traffic Control 
                     Attention Adventure Seekers!
Getting oxygen in and carbon dioxide out is more than just the name of the game…it’s a matter of life and death!
Do you have the right stuff? Can you:

 - Stay Cool Under Pressure?
 - Deliver Air Cargo Safely?
 - Keep Complex Routes Flowing Smoothly?
If so, then WE WANT YOU!!  Join the Team.
Put yourself to the Test!  Dust clouds, dander drifts, and giant invading cockroaches threaten your mission. Will you rise to the challenge?  Step up and find out! 
 
Trigger Finger
          Reward!!!
Asthma Triggers Wanted, Dead or Deceased!
For disturbing the peace, inflaming airways, attacking lungs, exacerbating bronchus, and other ornery and mischievous acts, these Asthma Outlaws, desperados, thieves, crooks, villains, thugs, bandits and no-good low-down varmints are hereby barred from civil society.
These Triggers should be considered armed and legged and dangerous!  They are clever and always looking to attack.  Bring them to justice, and prove once and for all that YOU have the fastest Trigger Finger in the West!
 
Tic Tac Blo
                          Don’t Get Blown Away!
Will the Big Bad Wolf blow your house down?  It all comes down to a battle of wits!
Put your asthma knowledge to the test in this fast-paced game of strategy and smarts.  If you know your facts you’ll give Big an epic smack down of fairy tale proportions.  But if you don’t, look out!  He’s going to blow your house down!!  Oh yes, my little piggy!

<li>Prize Pool<b>.</b> </li>

<li>Host and Caster costs. </li>
</ul><p>To be entirely transparent, here’s what the money<b> IS</b> going to, in order from highest to lowest priority: </p><ul>
<li>
<b>Venue Costs</b> The NAEC is actually cheaper than many of the alternatives we found, but the cost is still sizable.</li>
<li>
<b>Equipment </b>We need to worry about providing available computers for many of the players there (40 LoL Players and 16 SC2 players) in addition to what we need for production. Many of these are already covered by some of our Sponsors, but we need a handful more to be safe. </li>
<li>
<b>Player Travel and Accommodation</b> We’re currently offering housing and minimal stipends for our invited players, but being able to help even more with their travel can help guarantee high quality players. </li>
<li>
<b>Production Improvements</b> We’re already well into working on new, innovative production wizardry, but some of our current solutions are inconsistent. By adding backups and redundancies, we can continue our fantastic production even if one system starts giving bad data, or has an issue with the connection.</li>

WellPlayed has been developing ways to provide more detailed game stats for both SC2 and LoL. Lone Star Clash 3 is our chance to finish and polish this amazing technology. Development of these features will let us not just show new stats on stream, but let our backers view stats live in a web browser. Show swings and comebacks with the gold difference over the course of the game. Compare the gold difference of both teams, or pick two specific players to compare.Gold doesn’t mean much if you don’t spend it. This handy tug-of-war bar helps give an idea which team is stronger by totaling up the cost of all their items, excluding consumables such as potions and wards.See detailed stats about each champion, and learn exactly how the players are building.With StarCraft 2 we have many options of stats to show over time. The graphs show the difference in the stat between the two players, so you can see how the matches swing back and forth. Example stats:
Total supply
Mineral income
Gas income
Workers
Army supply
Average APM
If you have a suggestion let us know!These graphs become even more informative when we add the completion of certain milestones, such as new expansions or upgrades. Have a great idea for a stat you want to see? You can help us decide which new features to add.There’s an enormous amount of costs that go into a live event. We’ve tried our hardest to minimize the unnecessary, but are unfortunately having trouble finding all the funding. We plan to create one of the best produced, top-tier esports events in North America, but need a little help to get it done. To be clear, this money is NOT going to the following: 
Prize Pool. 
Staff costs. Most of TeSPA is either local, or a car ride away. WellPlayed’s costs are already being covered by IvyLoL and personal funds. 
Host and Caster costs. 
To be entirely transparent, here’s what the money IS going to, in order from highest to lowest priority: 

Venue Costs The NAEC is actually cheaper than many of the alternatives we found, but the cost is still sizable.

Equipment We need to worry about providing available computers for many of the players there (40 LoL Players and 16 SC2 players) in addition to what we need for production. Many of these are already covered by some of our Sponsors, but we need a handful more to be safe. 

Player Travel and Accommodation We’re currently offering housing and minimal stipends for our invited players, but being able to help even more with their travel can help guarantee high quality players. 

Production Improvements We’re already well into working on new, innovative production wizardry, but some of our current solutions are inconsistent. By adding backups and redundancies, we can continue our fantastic production even if one system starts giving bad data, or has an issue with the connection.
We have selected a collection of rewards for our backers meant to appeal to a variety of interests. Whether you are a casual stream viewer, a dedicated fan, or a sponsor looking to send a message, our tiered prizes enhance your engagement to the content on stream. 

Backer Tier - $1. For just a dollar, you get a behind-the-scenes look on our progress as we build the venue and prep for the event

Nerd Baller Tier - $5. Go deeper into stats with your own private window live, while the games are being played!

Fonzie Tier - $10. See your name in the credits once the stream is over! Plus, if you ask ""Am I cool?"" in Twitch chat, our bot will inform you just how cool you are. And all previous tiers.


Soapbox Tier - $25. Access to a private ""Backers Only"" chat. Just say ""!shoutbox <message>"" in Twitch to update your message. These will be moderated, and have a character limit. And all previous tiers.


Stylish Tier - $50. Your very own Lone Star Clash 3 T-shirt. And all previous tiers.


LoL Collection Tier - $90. A Lone Star Clash 3 poster, signed by the League of Legends players and casters! All $50 tier and below rewards.


SC2 Collection Tier - $90. A Lone Star Clash 3 poster, signed by the StarCraft II players and casters. All $50 tier and below rewards.


Fanboy Tier - $100. An exclusive dinner meet + greet with players, personalities, and staff. Your name in the stream credits updated to ""VIP"".

TeSPA was founded as a student organization at The University of Texas at Austin in 2010. The student group gained acclaim for its high-caliber productions that often eclipsed similar professionally-produced events in terms of viewership and community fervor with modest budgets and passionate volunteers. In 2012, the group hosted two unprecedented tournaments which elevated them to the global stage: Lone Star Clash 1 and 2. In October 2013, TeSPA rebranded and expanded its scope with the goal of empowering college gaming groups across the globe to build thriving communities and host epic events by providing tangible support needed to grow. TeSPA now has 40 chapters across North America and is aims for 75 by the end of 2014.WellPlayed Productions has existed as an esports production group since 2011. Originally made up of /r/starcraft members who ran reddit tournaments, the group eventually set out on their own to become an independent team of tournament organizers and producers. In StarCraft 2, WellPlayed’s best known works are IPL1 and more recently, the (Twitch) Ender’s Game Tournament and Ender’s Game Showmatch. In League of Legends, WellPlayed produced the CLG Premier Series, the PAX and GamesCom Spring Promotional Online Qualifiers, the NA Spring Promotion Qualifiers, and the NA Spring Promotion Tournament Group Stage. TeSPA + WP: Two Great Tastes That ESPORT Great Together It makes enormous sense for our two organizations to work together for Lone Star Clash 3. WellPlayed can benefit hugely from TeSPA’s previous live event experience- something sorely lacking in North America, outside of Fighting Games. TeSPA, on the other hand, will benefit from WellPlayed’s abilities to consistently push and improve production in esports.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

they are blessed (or cursed) by the dwarvish gods of war, none can
say. They sing and slay in equal measure, wandering the land in
search of terrifying beasts that might fall beneath their axe,
pausing only long enough to drink themselves into a stupor at a
roadside tavern. They are called raging slayers and their craving for
war cannot be slaked.</i></p>

Spahn and I am the one-man show that is <i>Barrel Rider Games.</i> In addition to publishing over seventy PDF products for Labyrinth Lord, OSRIC and Swords &amp; Wizardry I have also done freelance writing for Cubicle 7 Entertainment and regular contributions to Small Niche Games' <i>Brave the Labyrinth</i> magazine.<br/><br/>I've been playing table-top RPGs for over 25 years and Barrel Rider Games has been in business three years. In that time BRG has produced over 75 products, several of which have reached the top five on RPGNow's Hottest Sellers list. These include <i>Sleepy Hollow, Buccaneers &amp; Bilge Rats, Frozen Fortress of the Winter Warlord </i>and <i>Player's Companion.</i></p>
<p>This campaign is being launched to raise money to purchase the necessary equipment to publish the first major print product from <i>Barrel Rider Games - </i>the <i>Class Compendium.</i> The <i>Class Compendium</i> will be a compilation of fifty classes for use with Labyrinth Lord and other OSR games that were previously only available as PDFs. It will have a full color hardcover and feature black and white art through out its interior.</p>
<p>The <i>Class Compendium</i> was already well into production when the computer used to develop products for <i>Barrel Rider Games</i> began a rapid decline. It's only a matter of time before the poor, over-worked machine finally gives up the ghost and brings the future of <i>Barrel Rider Games</i> to a halt. To that end, I'm turning to the OSR community and internet at large to not only help me bring the <i>Class Compendium </i> to life, but also ensure the future of BRG for years to come through this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Where Your Money Goes</h3> <p>Because <i>Class Compendium </i>will be printed through One Bookshelf's Print-on-Demand service, the cost of production is kept to a minimum. Listed below is a break down of where the funds go.</p> <ul> <li>Hardware and Software to Produce the Book: $300</li> <li>Art, Editing &amp; Layout: $200</li> <li>Incidentals &amp; Buffer Money: $50</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Because of the nature of how the <i>Class Compendium</i> will be produced and the nature of Print-on-Demand products, there is very little risk involved. I'm giving myself an ample amount of time to prepare and develop the<i> Class Compendium</i>. Still, no project is fool proof. Delays can happen.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that delays occur, supporters will be kept up to date on a weekly basis. Communication is key. All supporters who receive PDF perks and at-cost rewards will be contacted via e-mail when the campaign has ended. PDFs will be made available within two weeks of the campaign ending and at cost print-on-demand products will be available as soon as the product proofs are approved.</p>

UPDATE: EXCLUSIVE CLASS THE THOPIAN GNOME!
And we're funded!!!!!!! So with that, let's reveal the final Class Compendium exclusive class: The Thopian Gnome. He's a devilishly charming little guy, inspired by and released with permission from Lesser Gnome, the Thopian Gnome is based on their iconic mascot! Part magic-user, part charming schemer, all gnome!
 Gnomes
are diminutive creatures, typically standing around three feet tall
with sharp features and long noses. They regularly sport long white
beards and merry smiles. The Thopian gnome is a rare subrace of these
creatures which is said to come from a distant realm in a hidden
vale. It is believed that they are all descended from a single
progenitor – a nefarious, yet highly virile gnome whose is said to
be have a skilled silver tongue and a gift for all manner of vile
magic.

WE'RE FUNDED!!!!!!!!!!
UPDATE: EXCLUSIVE CLASS THE LUCKY FOOL REVEALED!





Wow! We shot right past $500 and are just $25 dollars from our goal! That means the reveal of another original class for Labyrinth Lord and other old-school fantasy role-playing games for The Class Compendium: The Lucky Fool!
 It is said that halflings are born lucky and none exemplify this more than the Lucky Fool. Choosing to go off on an adventure on a whim, they have no real gifts or talents beyond their uncanny luck. Things always seem to turn out for the best for the Lucky Fool, no matter how bleak they seem. This uncanny trait makes them valuable, if often reckless additions to any adventuring party who some how accomplish the impossible through sheer chance!
This full 8-level class is for Labyrinth Lord and other old-school fantasy role-playing games. Art by Jeff Freels.








UPDATE: EXCLUSIVE CLASS THE RAGING SLAYER REVEALED!

We've soared past the $450 mark and are well on our way to $500! As promised here's a tease from the Class Compendium! A new, never before seen class exclusive to this product: The Raging Slayer!

 While
all dwarves have a natural knack for combat, there are some of the
bearded folk who are born with a special lust for battle. Whether
they are blessed (or cursed) by the dwarvish gods of war, none can
say. They sing and slay in equal measure, wandering the land in
search of terrifying beasts that might fall beneath their axe,
pausing only long enough to drink themselves into a stupor at a
roadside tavern. They are called raging slayers and their craving for
war cannot be slaked.
This is a full 12-level class is for Labyrinth Lord and other old-school fantasy role-playing games. Art by Maciej Zagorski of The Forge Studios.





UPDATE: CLASS COMPENDIUM INTRO BY DANIEL PROCTOR!

Short Summary Greetings,
My name is James M. Spahn and I am the one-man show that is Barrel Rider Games. In addition to publishing over seventy PDF products for Labyrinth Lord, OSRIC and Swords & Wizardry I have also done freelance writing for Cubicle 7 Entertainment and regular contributions to Small Niche Games' Brave the Labyrinth magazine.I've been playing table-top RPGs for over 25 years and Barrel Rider Games has been in business three years. In that time BRG has produced over 75 products, several of which have reached the top five on RPGNow's Hottest Sellers list. These include Sleepy Hollow, Buccaneers & Bilge Rats, Frozen Fortress of the Winter Warlord and Player's Companion.
This campaign is being launched to raise money to purchase the necessary equipment to publish the first major print product from Barrel Rider Games - the Class Compendium. The Class Compendium will be a compilation of fifty classes for use with Labyrinth Lord and other OSR games that were previously only available as PDFs. It will have a full color hardcover and feature black and white art through out its interior.
The Class Compendium was already well into production when the computer used to develop products for Barrel Rider Games began a rapid decline. It's only a matter of time before the poor, over-worked machine finally gives up the ghost and brings the future of Barrel Rider Games to a halt. To that end, I'm turning to the OSR community and internet at large to not only help me bring the Class Compendium  to life, but also ensure the future of BRG for years to come through this Indiegogo campaign.

    Where Your Money Goes Because Class Compendium will be printed through One Bookshelf's Print-on-Demand service, the cost of production is kept to a minimum. Listed below is a break down of where the funds go.  Hardware and Software to Produce the Book: $300 Art, Editing & Layout: $200 Incidentals & Buffer Money: $50    Risks & Challenges Because of the nature of how the Class Compendium will be produced and the nature of Print-on-Demand products, there is very little risk involved. I'm giving myself an ample amount of time to prepare and develop the Class Compendium. Still, no project is fool proof. Delays can happen.
In the unlikely event that delays occur, supporters will be kept up to date on a weekly basis. Communication is key. All supporters who receive PDF perks and at-cost rewards will be contacted via e-mail when the campaign has ended. PDFs will be made available within two weeks of the campaign ending and at cost print-on-demand products will be available as soon as the product proofs are approved.

<p>Our names are Jackson Tegu and Joe Mcdaldno. We want to come to Big Bad Con, but there is a spot of trouble. We live hundreds of miles and kilometers away. It's too far to walk - we're going to need to teach ourselves to fly, before we can actually make it down to California.<br/><br/>The good news is that we're both game designers in the vaguely autobiographical vein.

<p>This is a fundraiser to send two silly, loveable friends down to Big Bad Con. It's mostly a request for charity, as well as a chance for our friends to see us again if they can help subsidize the trip.

<p>The first game is Brave Sparrow, by Joe Mcdaldno. It's a game to be played in the margins of your own life (like Jackson Tegu's Temper, or The Stork by Andre Monserrat),  a meditation on what it means to be a sparrow trapped inside a human body, and a journey to return to your true form.<br/><br/>The second game is The Cacophony, by Jackson Tegu. It's a game about a flock – a murder, really – of magically realistic crows, descending upon a situation in order to pluck snippets out of human minds and chew them over with their colleagues. The Cacophony's playtime is short: it plays mid-session during another game's pause, drawing upon that story's fiction and adding to it in ways that enlighten, but don't burden.<br/><br/>Only backers of this IndieGoGo campaign will receive copies of these games at this time - no other copies will be made available before Fabricated Realities 2013.</p>
<p>Both of these games are short and strange.</p>

<p><br/>While we're offering games and other tokens of appreciation to those who support this campaign, it's mostly a request for charity. Only give money to this campaign if you're excited about the two of us arriving at Big Bad Con this fall.</p>
<p>The games on offer are short, and will likely be presented in a zine or pocketbook format. Think of them as a thank-you gift for a generous donation, as opposed to a game you've paid twenty-five dollars for.</p>

<h3>What do we dislike in location-based games?</h3>
<p>Most location-based games restrict the player to the area that they are currently in. That means that you often have to cross the street or walk a few blocks to reach an in-game objective or the player is forced to play by themselves due to the fact that no one else is playing in their area.</p>
<h3>What do we like about location-based games?</h3>
<p>We really love the idea of being able to use the entire world as a game map. Not only does it allow the game to have a really huge map, but anyone can travel in-game to their destination of choice, maybe they wish to travel to their hometown, a special holiday destination or even the stadium of their favorite sports club. Target Earth allows you to battle where ever and whenever you want.</p>
<h3>How is Target Earth different?</h3>
<p>Target Earth is not location-based, but rather location-aware: There are benefits to playing at your current location, but you are not tied down to it. You can virtually travel the world and conquer sectors where ever you please. Do you live in a boring village in Siberia and want to conquer Manhattan? Or are you stressed by the urban jungle and prefer conquering some quaint villages? In Target Earth you can.</p>
<p><img alt=""The Boss says..."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/RfOfQjt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>But if we love the huge in-game world, how can we guarantee that there are enough players?</h3>
<p>We are totally aware of this problem and therefore we incorporated a unique dynamic map into our game. Our game world dynamically adapts to the number of players in each region to prevent overcrowding or isolation. In the beginning, earth will be divided into four sectors, this is enough for the first few players to not have to play against AI. As more players join the game, sectors with higher activity will split up faster to make room for new players. In the beginning you fight for continents and oceans, but in the end you will be fighting vicious street battles for every inch of planet earth.</p>
<h3>Do you have to walk around to play our game?</h3>
<p>Definitely not, you get certain benefits if you play in your current location, but as we said before, you can play anywhere you like. The world is yours for the taking. Thanks to OpenStreetMap, we were able to integrate geographic areas spanning the entire world and have been able to make sure that every zoom level is as close to real life as possible.</p>

<h3>Crafting</h3>
<p>For every fight that you win, you will be rewarded with energy sources and resources that you will need to build your army of cyborgs. Defeated cyborgs will drop the resources that you need to build a new one, so if you want to build stronger cyborgs, you will first have to defeat them in battle. Currently we have over 20 different in-game resources, but if our funding is successful, we will add even more.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n252/lordhadeskiller/Target%20Earth/Screen_1_zps146de4c8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>In the research bay of your ship you can develop new weapons or upgrade those you already have. To use those mighty weapons you will first have to research new blueprints to produce cyborgs that can handle them. Every weapon belongs to one of the three categories ""Energy"", ""Hacking"" or ""Physical"". You need cyborgs that are specialized in those skills to use your weapons with maximal effectiveness.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n252/lordhadeskiller/Target%20Earth/Screen_4_zpse004a8cc.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h3>Tactics</h3>
<p>A wise general once said, battles are won and lost before they have even been fought. By selecting the right weapons before a battle, you can increase the chances of successful attacks and ultimate victory. Cyborgs have different attack and defence skills in ""Energy"", ""Hacking"" and ""Physical"" attacks, so you have to analyze your opponents and choose the right cyborgs and weapons configuration to defeat them. Stronger cyborgs can bring more weapons into battle, so as the game evolves, tactics become more complex and battles become more challenging.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i114.photobucket.com/albums/n252/lordhadeskiller/Target%20Earth/Screen_2_zps63da4f60.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </strong></p>
<h3>Sector games</h3>
<p>The world is divided into different sectors. Each sector consists of a grid of 6x6 fields that you can attack with your cyborgs. To conquer a sector and split it up into new sectors the players have to achieve the victory conditions. When the sector has been conquered, each player who took part in the mission gets a reward for their efforts. The rules for those sector games are not always the same. Currently we have two different rule sets, but if our funding is successful, then we will be able to develop and implement more game types to add more variety to the battles.</p>
<h3>Leaderboards</h3>
<p>By conquering sectors, you collect pieces of geographic areas like continents, countries, urban districts or streets, depending on how far the territories have been divided up. If you collect enough pieces, you will be rewarded with a badge from ""The Boss"" and it will count towards your overall ranking and also to your local ranking. You can compete with other players in your area to add to your regional ranking and become the don of your area. Completing other tasks will also count towards your overall ranking, along with your various victories in battle.</p>
<h1>Credits, but for what?</h1>
<p>An important part of the Target Earth eco-system are credits. They are necessary for two aspects of the game; functional and visual elements. Functional elements are ""speed-ups"" (if you are impatient), production upgrades (if you are even more impatient) and travel, if you don't like where you are located. Visual elements come in the form of pimping out the way that your cyborg look, nicer attack animations (your opponent will be impressed) and a different skin for your ship.</p>
<p>One option to receive credits is by playing the game with a certain degree of success. Battle for territory, fight against your opponents and you will be rewarded with credits. But your income of credits is rather low and requires a lot of screen time. The second option is to buy them. This way you can fast track your game by increasing your cyborg production rate and completion times, and also allowing you to travel to other areas more frequently.</p>
<p>But to be clear, our philosophy about how we develop games is: play to win and not pay to win. Therefore you are never forced to buy credits at all. You can still build your army and research your weapons without them. We think having fun in the game shouldn't depend on your wallet. This image illustrates the way that credits play a part in Target Earth. It does not show the entire economy, but the tiny part credits play in the game.</p>

<p><strong>halfreal games</strong> was born in the heart of <strong>Berlin</strong>, Germany, founded by three recent university graduates in 2012. With a dream of creating our own game developing company and a passion for games of all sorts, we took our dream to the next level and founded a <strong>start-up</strong> company and halfreal games was born. The team itself has grown over the months, with some new faces who have joined the halfreal family. But one thing has not changed: our dream of creating geo-social games that challenge the player and achieve long-term motivation and excitement.</p>
<p>The company was awarded a ""Gründerstipendium"", a sort of start-up grant by the <strong>Gründerwerkstatt</strong>, a business incubator, operated by the Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin.                                                                    </p>
<p>The funding was set to last for 18 months and the company also received co-working office space and other support and has come a long way in that time. But the challenge of creating a great game was far more than we expected and time started to fly by as we worked to finish Target Earth. Now we are so close to our goal of releasing the game and only need that last financial push to get us over that hill and release Target Earth.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Please note, that if we do not reach our goal, it could be that certain perks will take longer to be issued due to Target Earth not being released yet. This mainly refers to the in game currency and the special weapon that have been listed in the perks section.</p>
<p>But we assure you that we will definitly try, no matter if the goal is reached or not, to finish Target Earth. Too much work and time has already been invested for it not to be completed.</p>

Yesterday our campaign ended for Target Earth and as you may have noticed we did not reach our funding goal. But we are not down and out, we learnt a lot from this campaign and received some very helpful feedback from the community about our game.  We would like to thank all of you for showing your support for our campaign, may it have been by backing our campaign or sharing it on your social networks. Although the amount we need to complete Target Earth was not achieved, your contributions helped us to stay afloat a bit longer.  We live to fight another day and Target Earth will be released, it will just take a bit longer than we hoped. To underline our commitment to our game, we are about to launch our Alpha version and we are looking for testers. For those who are interested in participating in our Alpha version for Android, you can sign up  Here   For those who have selected a perk that is not in-game credit related, fear not. Your item or items will be delivered to you in the coming weeks. Thank you for believing in us!

Runs on Windows, Linux, Mac OS -> Finished Version will only run on IPhone and Android, so test it while its hot!


Target Earth is a location-aware sci-fi strategy game with turn-based tactical battles. To add to the already long category title, it is also a massive-multiplayer mobile game and it will be released for the Android and iOS platforms.
The key features of Target Earth are:


Level-up your character to unlock more powerful cyborgs and arm them with stronger weapons.
Play against other players in turn-based battles with over 20 different cyborgs and weapons to choose from.
Play in multiple sectors against different enemies at the same time.
Battle against different enemies with different sets of tactical rules.
Collect resources to craft your army of cyborgs.

Research new blueprints to build stronger cyborgs and improve your researched weapons to get the most out of them.

Upgrade your ship to increase your cyborg production and weapon research.
Collect numerous award badges to impress other players and document your in-game progress.
Compete on regional leaderboards within your neighborhood or hometown and climb in the rankings on the global leaderboard.


We plan to add more multiplayer features, like team play and PvP (Player vs player) real time battles, if we exceed our funding goal or if the game is successful enough to fund the development by itself. You can read more on this in the section ""Stretched Goals"" below.




What do we dislike in location-based games?
Most location-based games restrict the player to the area that they are currently in. That means that you often have to cross the street or walk a few blocks to reach an in-game objective or the player is forced to play by themselves due to the fact that no one else is playing in their area.
What do we like about location-based games?
We really love the idea of being able to use the entire world as a game map. Not only does it allow the game to have a really huge map, but anyone can travel in-game to their destination of choice, maybe they wish to travel to their hometown, a special holiday destination or even the stadium of their favorite sports club. Target Earth allows you to battle where ever and whenever you want.
How is Target Earth different?
Target Earth is not location-based, but rather location-aware: There are benefits to playing at your current location, but you are not tied down to it. You can virtually travel the world and conquer sectors where ever you please. Do you live in a boring village in Siberia and want to conquer Manhattan? Or are you stressed by the urban jungle and prefer conquering some quaint villages? In Target Earth you can.

But if we love the huge in-game world, how can we guarantee that there are enough players?
We are totally aware of this problem and therefore we incorporated a unique dynamic map into our game. Our game world dynamically adapts to the number of players in each region to prevent overcrowding or isolation. In the beginning, earth will be divided into four sectors, this is enough for the first few players to not have to play against AI. As more players join the game, sectors with higher activity will split up faster to make room for new players. In the beginning you fight for continents and oceans, but in the end you will be fighting vicious street battles for every inch of planet earth.
Do you have to walk around to play our game?
Definitely not, you get certain benefits if you play in your current location, but as we said before, you can play anywhere you like. The world is yours for the taking. Thanks to OpenStreetMap, we were able to integrate geographic areas spanning the entire world and have been able to make sure that every zoom level is as close to real life as possible.


 My solar system is overcrowded and corrupt and the three big corporations are calling all the shots, or are they? Their infighting makes it easy for a mob-boss like myself to make a pretty penny while they turn a blind eye. Now they have found a new planet to conquer and I am going to make sure that I get my tentacles on a piece of the action.  The new blue planet is called earth and I can already taste all the money that I will be making selling off its precious territories. Now I don't have enough thugs to go and do my dirty work in the pre-invasion, so I need free agents like yourself to get me those territories. I will give you what you need to get to earth and then it will be up to you to fight your way to the top and become my number one agent. But nothing in life is free, so don't for one second think that this is a free meal ticket, I always triple my money on my investments, always!

Crafting
For every fight that you win, you will be rewarded with energy sources and resources that you will need to build your army of cyborgs. Defeated cyborgs will drop the resources that you need to build a new one, so if you want to build stronger cyborgs, you will first have to defeat them in battle. Currently we have over 20 different in-game resources, but if our funding is successful, we will add even more.

Research
In the research bay of your ship you can develop new weapons or upgrade those you already have. To use those mighty weapons you will first have to research new blueprints to produce cyborgs that can handle them. Every weapon belongs to one of the three categories ""Energy"", ""Hacking"" or ""Physical"". You need cyborgs that are specialized in those skills to use your weapons with maximal effectiveness.
 
Tactics
A wise general once said, battles are won and lost before they have even been fought. By selecting the right weapons before a battle, you can increase the chances of successful attacks and ultimate victory. Cyborgs have different attack and defence skills in ""Energy"", ""Hacking"" and ""Physical"" attacks, so you have to analyze your opponents and choose the right cyborgs and weapons configuration to defeat them. Stronger cyborgs can bring more weapons into battle, so as the game evolves, tactics become more complex and battles become more challenging.

You can compete with other players in your area to add to your regional ranking and become the don of your area. Completing other tasks will also count towards your overall ranking, along with your various victories in battle.
Credits, but for what?
An important part of the Target Earth eco-system are credits. They are necessary for two aspects of the game; functional and visual elements. Functional elements are ""speed-ups"" (if you are impatient), production upgrades (if you are even more impatient) and travel, if you don't like where you are located. Visual elements come in the form of pimping out the way that your cyborg look, nicer attack animations (your opponent will be impressed) and a different skin for your ship.
One option to receive credits is by playing the game with a certain degree of success. Battle for territory, fight against your opponents and you will be rewarded with credits. But your income of credits is rather low and requires a lot of screen time. The second option is to buy them. This way you can fast track your game by increasing your cyborg production rate and completion times, and also allowing you to travel to other areas more frequently.
But to be clear, our philosophy about how we develop games is: play to win and not pay to win. Therefore you are never forced to buy credits at all. You can still build your army and research your weapons without them. We think having fun in the game shouldn't depend on your wallet. This image illustrates the way that credits play a part in Target Earth. It does not show the entire economy, but the tiny part credits play in the game.

First and foremost by pledging, every donation counts and your contributions will help in finishing this project and bringing the game to the public.
Just as important as pledging your hard earned Dollars and Euros, is spreading the word about our campaign. So if you use the usual social media networks, maybe you have a blog, or you make Youtube videos, if you could share our campaign that would be amazing. Every bit of publicity helps.
 

halfreal games was born in the heart of Berlin, Germany, founded by three recent university graduates in 2012. With a dream of creating our own game developing company and a passion for games of all sorts, we took our dream to the next level and founded a start-up company and halfreal games was born. The team itself has grown over the months, with some new faces who have joined the halfreal family. But one thing has not changed: our dream of creating geo-social games that challenge the player and achieve long-term motivation and excitement.
The company was awarded a ""Gründerstipendium"", a sort of start-up grant by the Gründerwerkstatt, a business incubator, operated by the Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin.                                                                    
The funding was set to last for 18 months and the company also received co-working office space and other support and has come a long way in that time. But the challenge of creating a great game was far more than we expected and time started to fly by as we worked to finish Target Earth. Now we are so close to our goal of releasing the game and only need that last financial push to get us over that hill and release Target Earth.
 

 
 
 

Please note, that if we do not reach our goal, it could be that certain perks will take longer to be issued due to Target Earth not being released yet. This mainly refers to the in game currency and the special weapon that have been listed in the perks section.
But we assure you that we will definitly try, no matter if the goal is reached or not, to finish Target Earth. Too much work and time has already been invested for it not to be completed.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our good friend, Leslie M. Collins has many dreams in life.  Most of them are beyond our control; however, one of his most infamous dreams is to own a Cobra Command arcade machine of his very own.  We can help Leslie fulfill this dream.</p>
<p>Leslie is well-known online in the various arcade-related forums for his excessive (and often misinterpreted) enthusiasm for classic arcade games.  Having known Leslie for over 12 years, myself and others have come to care for him very much.  Leslie wants the same things out of life that most of us do...  good health, a house of his own, a wife, kids, a good job, and people who care about him.  Leslie has yet to attain many of these things... and by no fault of his own.</p>
<p>Leslie is a good person who deserves our compassion and friendship.  We can help him to fulfill at least one of his life-long dreams.  So let's do it. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have the speicifcs for the Cobra Command cabinet in Leslie's dreams.  It needs to be a Cliffhanger-style cabinet with red ball joystick and Cobra Command artwork.  A picture of the exact cabinet Leslie wants is posted in the gallery.  I am tacking on some additional requirements in that this Cobra Command machine needs to be made out of all-new components to prevent reoccurring breakdowns.  Inside will be a solid-state computer running the Daphne Laserdisc emulator software.  <a href=""http://www.daphne-emu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.daphne-emu.com</a>.  A brand new monitor will be installed.</p>
<p>The funds for this project will pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cabinet and freight</li>
<li>Reproduced artwork/paint</li>
<li>Any missing cabinet parts (ie: Coin door)</li>
<li>All new electronics</li>
<li>Freight to Southern California</li>
<li>Freight to Las Vegas, NV</li>
<li>Perks</li>
</ul>
<p>We are donating our time to this project.  <strong>ANY MONEY LEFT OVER OR ABOVE AND BEYOND THE $2,500 GOAL WILL GO TO LESLIE'S CASE-WORKER FOR SAFE-KEEPING FOR HIS WELFARE.</strong></p>
<p>The cabinet will first go to Steve Bower who will handle the painting and artwork.  It will then be shipped to me, Brad Oldham, where the electronics will be taken care of.  I will rent a truck and drive the game to Leslie's apartment in Las Vegas NV in August, September, or October of 2013.</p>
<p>We have set up some perks for various donation amounts. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a great opportunity to do something nice for someone else in need.  This isn't so much about getting a Cobra Command for Leslie... it is more about showing Leslie that there are a whole lot of people who care about him. </p>
<p>We will take video of the Cobra Command delivery and post it for all to see.  It will be awesome to see Leslie fulfilling one of his life-long dreams.  All contributors are invited to come to Las Vegas, NV for the grand finale where we will deliver the Cobra Command machine to Leslie.  We will all go out to eat at <a href=""mailto:Buffet@Asia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Buffet@Asia</a>.</p>

<h2 class=""fl"">28mm Egyptian Harem Miniatures</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, I'm Mike Burns, a long-time gamer and miniatures collector who has had a passion for adventures in historical settings.  I was inspired by archaeology, history and Hollywood films to create a range of pseudo-historical Egyptian figures for use in role-playing games, wargames and collecting.  The focus of the range is the court and harem of the Egyptian pharaoh which many lavish Hollywood epics are set.  The costumes of some characters in this range are purely historical, while others have a healthy dose of Hollywood about them.  This is my second Indiegogo campaign producing Egyptian Harem miniatures and it is somewhat more ambitious than the first campaign which offered only a single set of miniatures.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A total of five different sets of Egyptian harem miniatures are being offered as perks which have been sculpted by the legendary Kev Adams and the talented Brother Vinni and Snuurg.  These high-quality 28mm miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and have an incredible amount of detail and personality. Whether you are a collector or gamer you are certain to enjoy these figures!  <em><strong>Check out the gallery for more images!</strong></em></p>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>A number of perks ranging from $10 to $190 have been offered so that anyone with an interest in these miniatures can make a contribution.  Everyone will receive their sets of miniatures in small zip-lock bags with plastic slotta bases.  (Sorry - no blister packs yet!).</li>

The Impact Of Your Contribution
The successful funding of this project will really help to move things forward with expanding the range by commissioning more miniatures to be sculpted.  Future sets include alot of interesting and useful characters that are not often found in miniature including; the queens of Egypt and their attendants, servants, more eunuch guards, foreign concubines, pharaoh's favourites, exotic pets and even Egyptian vampires and demons.  I will post some of my concept drawings on which these future sets of miniatures will be based in the gallery.
Other Ways You Can Help This Project
Pharaoh has sent chariots and messengers far and wide to spread the word, but you too can help!

Ask friends, gaming associates, minions and anyone you think might be interested in these excellent miniatures from ancient Egypt to get the word out.

<p><b>Who
Am I?</b></p>I am Mona and I am a Highlands Athlete. Sounds like I
     am introducing myself at an AA meeting doesn't it?  At this
     point in my life, it does almost feel like I am addicted to this sport. I
     had, for most of my adult life been a couch potato.  I was never an
     athlete, not in high school, nor in college.  I certainly never threw
     on a track team. I am what some affectionately refer to as an MCA~Midlife
     Crisis Athlete.<p><br/></p><p>In the
summer of 2010, I had to face the reality that I was getting sick and that I
was the one making myself sick.  I had given up on my body in the prime of
life and I was now paying the price: pre-diabetic, advancing arthritis,
severe stenosis in my neck, bad liver and kidney functions, and joints that
barely carried me up a flight of stairs.  At the encouragement of a dear
friend, I started CrossFit.  It was horrible, but I stuck with it.  </p>
<p>Fast
forward about 10 months: I had lost 45 pounds and I had begun to understand
that yes, there really can be an athlete inside of everyone. While I enjoyed the gym, I felt
that there needed to be more. Then I remembered an old friend of my husband's, Chuck Thomas, who
was involved in the Highland Games. I contacted him to find out if women did
this crazy ""thing"" too, and he assured me that, yes, women do
throw.  </p>
<p>I was
initially hesitant, but my husband encouraged me to give it a go, “Well, I could go down, just try it. What can it hurt?""  One of the defining moments of becoming an athlete came
on a cool spring morning when I picked up that hammer for the first time and
fell in love, with possibilities. That moment would change, utterly and completely, how I see myself, how much I would discover about myself, about training, about
determination, about failure, about success. I am also much healthier than when
I started, not just from time spent in the gym, but time on the field.<span>  I don't worry about blood work anymore and
although I still have issues with my neck; moving and competition keep me
flexible and healthy.</span></p>
<p>To my
surprise and delight, the folks who run the games here in New Mexico pushed
me.<span>  They saw potential in me I did not
know was there.  I am actually pretty
good. Through the support of other athletes, there are pieces of myself, my
power that I found, that I never knew I had lost. I am so glad I said yes to
this physical ""experiment"" in part because I have met the most
amazing people from literally, all over the world.  </span></p>
<p><b>What am I doing?</b></p>I am going to the Masters World Championship Game which
     next year will be held in Inverness, Scotland, September 12th through the
     14th. It is not my first time at these traveling games, but it is my first
     opportunity to attend games in Scotland! The thought of being able to
     compete in Scotland, with some of the best throwers in the world is nearly
     more than my mind can process at times. It is not hyperbole to say this
     sport saved my life. To be able to throw where the
     games started connects me to hundreds of years and tens of thousands of
     athletes who believe the same. I have had major changes in my life this
     past year and I am reaching out for help. I cannot do this without the
     support of my friends and family.<br/><br/>This is not about winning the games, or some trophy: I
     win as a thrower each time I show up on the field. Each time I compete I strike a blow against every doctor that told me I would just feel more and
     more pain as I aged.<span>  Hopefully,
     other middle aged women can look at me and see it is never too late to say
     yes to their physical potential, their strength. I know that my children
     see what I do and they are proud of me, even if they tease me a little! I
     have no doubt that I am a better parent for having found this sport.  Both kids now find time in the gym to be a source of stress relief and a way to connect
     to their bodies.</span><br/><br/>I know that some of you have heard me speak of my
     ""Highlands Family,"" I don't take that lightly, it isn't just a
     catch phrase for me.  Finding this group of athletes has changed me
     in ways I am only beginning to understand.  I am making choices from
     a place of strength and empowerment. So, I am asking you to help me
     go to these games, to be a part of something larger than I can ever be on

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Blaster - Bande-Annonce (Français) - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kfmVNFpxm8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kfmVNFpxm8</a><br/></span></p>
<br/><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is Blaster ?</h3>Blaster is a browser-based game with a unique mix between brickbreaker and pong gameplay elements, taking place on a futuristic background.<br/><br/>It features :<br/><br/>- 6 different game modes ranging from classic Time Attack mode to intense head-to-head duels with different teams on unique ships, in arenas full of soon-to-be destroyed boxes and power-ups.<br/><br/>- 6 teams with their specific ships. Every ship has unique stats of Power, Health, Recovery and Speed.<br/><br/>- 5 unique power-ups with unique multiplier bonuses, the higher your game multiplier, the better your power-up effects will be, even granting stats bonuses on higher multiplier levels. GigaBall, SonicBall, GigaPaddle, Minimize and Distort, the choice is yours to bring nightmare into the game field. You're even able to store and switch between your 3 first acquired power-ups at anytime !<br/><br/>- Enthralling sounds and music. Every bit of sound and graphics has been studied so as to put more focus on immediate action without getting in the way, you could almost play without actually watching the game.<br/><br/>- Pure and clean graphics and overall design was made so as to be immediately readable by anyone. Power-ups got color codes, boxes are also color coded. Gameplay decisions like ""when to play a power-up while another is  being used and how much time left have I got before this power-up gets dumped "" must be made in less than a second, so everything in the game is made to achieve a speed-thinking action game !<br/><br/>- Competition-based gameplay with achievements, ladders, levels and experience values. Being highly connected to Social Platforms, show your ever-growing skills and even participate to real-world online tournaments.<br/><br/>- A Serial Pixel experience like none other... <br/><br/><h3>What do we need ?</h3>We have actually achieved an alpha version with most of the gameplay features included. We have been using a free version of the Unity3D game engine and for a better game experience we recently switched to the 30-days limited pro edition of Unity3D. Having the alpha version of the game ready is great and we would like to start our ""SERIAL PIXEL"" methodology (please read it on ""Our Story"" below) and have everyone test and submit ideas to form and expand on our base and create the most exciting experience both for us and for our followers. Unfortunately we can't publish even our alpha without now buying the full version of Unity3D which costs 1500$. If we achieve this goal everyone will immediately receive a link with a special code granting you access to Blaster and a personal profile to start earning experience points, ranks etc...<br/><br/>So to summarize : <br/><br/>- 1500$ to pay for a pro license of Unity3D game engine.<br/>- Everything exceeding this we'll get invested on our Serial Pixel platform, website costs and development.<br/><br/>Actually we aren't making any money out of it yet but of course our wish would be to be able to do full-time work on our projects.<br/><br/>Of course if you can't  support us this way, you can still help us a lot by spreading our campaign everywhere you want, Facebook, blogs, mails, etc... You can also write to us directly and ask us questions about this project or just get in touch with us because you know...we're nice guys ^^ !<br/><br/><h3>What you get for supporting us ?</h3>Our love and admiration... but you also get some interesting perks ! You'll be getting the game as soon as the goal is reached, and also be the first to give us input and ideas to develop Blaster further. For those who want to support us a little bit more, you'll be treated as funders all over our website and on our credits (in-game and website). You can get unique vouchers and merchandising coupons for Blaster goodies and future Serial Pixel titles. And you'll be also invited to live online meetings with us to work on immediate releases and gameplay additions. Finally for EPIC supporters, you can get your name in-game as an actual Star Blaster Pilot (Every team we'll be having up to three pilots) and for the UBER EPIC supporters, you can have one of the four Final Boss have the name you'll choose (you'll get a description of the boss so to have more inspired name ideas) !<br/><br/>Finally you get our eternal gratitude, this project having been a lot of work and personal sacrifice, we really hope it will work, thanks to you!<br/><br/><br/><h3>What is Serial Pixel project ?<br/>
</h3>
<br/><p>Serial Pixel would be an indie videogame studio, where the major 
concerns would be make fun/accessible games, highly connected to social 
networks and competition-geared games.</p>
<p>Also we want Serial Pixel to have some ""ethical rules"" in which we 
strongly believe. The first rule is that we would want to achieve a high
 degree of involvement from the community in the development of our 
games. From bug reports to forum topics or even polls, we want to make 
games for the gamers themselves. This involvement could have impact on 
what is the next feature to add or even on storyline and background 
events, thus creating an Open-Social game where everyone can have his 
ideas put on the game (Of course every idea would be weighted by the developers and the community itself.</p>
<p>The second rule concerns our business model. We think that the ""Pay 
What You Want"" approach is best-suited for us and our gaming community. 
But we want to stress that we don't want any Item-store or In-game 
benefit from paying more. No matter how much you pay, from 1 dollar to 
50, you'll get the exact same game, the only difference being the more 
you pay, the more goodies you can get. Our goal is to earn your support 
(and love !) and thus fans would be able to support us a little more, 
but still regular gamers would be able to get our games for as low as 1 Euro.</p>
<br/><h3>About Us<br/>
</h3>We are two French guys who met three years ago, at school. Freshly graduated from our 3D/CG school, we  felt like doing something from our passion : videogames. While at school we had a lot of conversations with a lot of people from the industry and outside of it, we talked about how we perceived this industry, gameplay-centric designs, etc... So after having graduated, we thought we would try and make games, and we focused our attention on a piece of software called unity3D.

Blaster - Bande-Annonce (Français) - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kfmVNFpxm8
What is Blaster ?Blaster is a browser-based game with a unique mix between brickbreaker and pong gameplay elements, taking place on a futuristic background.It features :- 6 different game modes ranging from classic Time Attack mode to intense head-to-head duels with different teams on unique ships, in arenas full of soon-to-be destroyed boxes and power-ups.- 6 teams with their specific ships. Every ship has unique stats of Power, Health, Recovery and Speed.- 5 unique power-ups with unique multiplier bonuses, the higher your game multiplier, the better your power-up effects will be, even granting stats bonuses on higher multiplier levels. GigaBall, SonicBall, GigaPaddle, Minimize and Distort, the choice is yours to bring nightmare into the game field. You're even able to store and switch between your 3 first acquired power-ups at anytime !- Enthralling sounds and music. Every bit of sound and graphics has been studied so as to put more focus on immediate action without getting in the way, you could almost play without actually watching the game.- Pure and clean graphics and overall design was made so as to be immediately readable by anyone. Power-ups got color codes, boxes are also color coded. Gameplay decisions like ""when to play a power-up while another is  being used and how much time left have I got before this power-up gets dumped "" must be made in less than a second, so everything in the game is made to achieve a speed-thinking action game !- Competition-based gameplay with achievements, ladders, levels and experience values. Being highly connected to Social Platforms, show your ever-growing skills and even participate to real-world online tournaments.- A Serial Pixel experience like none other... What do we need ?We have actually achieved an alpha version with most of the gameplay features included. We have been using a free version of the Unity3D game engine and for a better game experience we recently switched to the 30-days limited pro edition of Unity3D. Having the alpha version of the game ready is great and we would like to start our ""SERIAL PIXEL"" methodology (please read it on ""Our Story"" below) and have everyone test and submit ideas to form and expand on our base and create the most exciting experience both for us and for our followers. Unfortunately we can't publish even our alpha without now buying the full version of Unity3D which costs 1500$. If we achieve this goal everyone will immediately receive a link with a special code granting you access to Blaster and a personal profile to start earning experience points, ranks etc...So to summarize : - 1500$ to pay for a pro license of Unity3D game engine.- Everything exceeding this we'll get invested on our Serial Pixel platform, website costs and development.Actually we aren't making any money out of it yet but of course our wish would be to be able to do full-time work on our projects.Of course if you can't  support us this way, you can still help us a lot by spreading our campaign everywhere you want, Facebook, blogs, mails, etc... You can also write to us directly and ask us questions about this project or just get in touch with us because you know...we're nice guys ^^ !What you get for supporting us ?Our love and admiration... but you also get some interesting perks ! You'll be getting the game as soon as the goal is reached, and also be the first to give us input and ideas to develop Blaster further. For those who want to support us a little bit more, you'll be treated as funders all over our website and on our credits (in-game and website). You can get unique vouchers and merchandising coupons for Blaster goodies and future Serial Pixel titles. And you'll be also invited to live online meetings with us to work on immediate releases and gameplay additions. Finally for EPIC supporters, you can get your name in-game as an actual Star Blaster Pilot (Every team we'll be having up to three pilots) and for the UBER EPIC supporters, you can have one of the four Final Boss have the name you'll choose (you'll get a description of the boss so to have more inspired name ideas) !Finally you get our eternal gratitude, this project having been a lot of work and personal sacrifice, we really hope it will work, thanks to you!What is Serial Pixel project ?

Serial Pixel would be an indie videogame studio, where the major 
concerns would be make fun/accessible games, highly connected to social 
networks and competition-geared games.
Also we want Serial Pixel to have some ""ethical rules"" in which we 
strongly believe. The first rule is that we would want to achieve a high
 degree of involvement from the community in the development of our 
games. From bug reports to forum topics or even polls, we want to make 
games for the gamers themselves. This involvement could have impact on 
what is the next feature to add or even on storyline and background 
events, thus creating an Open-Social game where everyone can have his 
ideas put on the game (Of course every idea would be weighted by the developers and the community itself.
The second rule concerns our business model. We think that the ""Pay 
What You Want"" approach is best-suited for us and our gaming community. 
But we want to stress that we don't want any Item-store or In-game 
benefit from paying more. No matter how much you pay, from 1 dollar to 
50, you'll get the exact same game, the only difference being the more 
you pay, the more goodies you can get. Our goal is to earn your support 
(and love !) and thus fans would be able to support us a little more, 
but still regular gamers would be able to get our games for as low as 1 Euro.

<p class=""p1"">Columbus Little takes your kids on a journey to various lovely designed locations and let's them learn about them in a playful way.

<p>Our story begins in the distant future (2009) with Troy Sanders working at a small town pizza shop. His co-workers nicknamed him “T-rock” because his name starts with “T” and he Rocks. Somehow this turned into some story about him having his own planet called T-rocktopia.</p>
<p>His friend [Ben Mock] heard about his planet and said, “dude! Please let me write the story line for T-rocktopia!” (because you know, he likes writing stories and drawing.)</p>
<p>So T-Rocktopia became a story about Four Heroes, who can use Music and Acoustical Energy to protect the Planet of Music against evil Cyborgs and Robots.</p>
<p>Then with the combined powers of Ben Mock’s Graphic Design skills and Troy Sanders Programming skills, they started making games. And then Karah Sanders (Troy’s sister) was like, “I’ll promote stuff and do merchandise things” [so she did]</p>
<p>At some point they needed some business cards and Troy said, “Let’s make our business cards look like Trading Cards.” But when they started handing them out people where like, “Is this a game? We want this game.”</p>

<p>One of the coolest things about Colossal Blob is that it was chosen as one of the 5 finalists in Hasbro's Great Game Contest for 2016!  Hasbro had around 650 games to look at and decided that Colossal Blob was one of the most fun out of all of them!</p>
<p>The grand prize winner of the challenge will receive $25,000 and they will get to visit Hasbro and take Colossal Blob to make it even more awesome! It goes without saying that I would love Colossal Blob to be the grand prize winner, but we can't accomplish this goal without your help. So, tell you friends, tell your family and tell your pets to support Colossal Blob. Let's help it to become the biggest, baddest most colossal backed Indie Go Go campaign ever!</p>

<h2>The Cost of Blobs</h2>
<p>While it would probably take cities millions of dollars to rebuild civilization from a blob attack, to fund Colossal Blob, we're looking to raise $4,000. While we aren't rebuilding any cities, we are putting together a quality game and taking care of other fees that come with running a funding campaign. We really want to bring this game to life for friends and families to enjoy together, but we need your help to do that. As this is a fixed campaign, the game will only get made if we reach our goal. If the goal isn't met and the game isn't funded, Colossal Blob will not be made and we don't keep your money. Let's help the blobs succeed and make this campaign Colossal!</p>
<p>We are working with the wonderful people at <a href=""https://www.admagic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ad Magic</a> to print the game and bring it to life! They have been great to work with, going out of their way to help us get the information we need to put Colossal Blob in your hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>We completely understand that not everyone is in a position to help fund the campaign. However, there are still ways you can help Colossal Blob! You can show your support by sharing this Indiegogo page, the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/colossalblob/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a>, or the video from the campaign with your friends on Facebook, Twitter or in person!

<p>When Richard was young, he lived in Detroit. The area he lived in was unsafe, so he and his sister had to stay inside a lot of the time. He spent most days watching monster movies and playing games. He also formed his silly sense of humor from clowning around at school during that time, trying to make people laugh. As he got older he wanted to take his love of silly humor, monsters and games and put them together somehow. Colossal Blob became that “somehow,” as it combines all of these things into one!</p>
<p><br/>Danielle doesn’t consider herself a bookworm, but rather a book dragon! Danielle's love of reading lead to her super active imagination. As a kid she imagined that she owned all sorts of fantastic pets and creatures. She would have loved to own a little blob!

The exclusive and rare Colossal Yeti Blob Plush! (with back story) 

The Colossal Yeti Blob has been talked about for centuries but never actually seen in the wild. This is the amazingly rare Yeti Blob Plush and this perk is the only way to bag your own! The Yeti Blob will also come with a back story printed just for you, so only you will know the secret origin of the Colossal Yeti Blob. Get these quick, there are only 3 available!

 
STRETCH GOALS
Of course, not only will you be able to get cool items for backing certain perks, but we have a lot of fun stretch goals too! If we reaching these funding goals, you'll find these additional, fun extras. Let's take a look!
 
The Cost of Blobs
While it would probably take cities millions of dollars to rebuild civilization from a blob attack, to fund Colossal Blob, we're looking to raise $4,000. While we aren't rebuilding any cities, we are putting together a quality game and taking care of other fees that come with running a funding campaign. We really want to bring this game to life for friends and families to enjoy together, but we need your help to do that. As this is a fixed campaign, the game will only get made if we reach our goal. If the goal isn't met and the game isn't funded, Colossal Blob will not be made and we don't keep your money. Let's help the blobs succeed and make this campaign Colossal!
We are working with the wonderful people at Ad Magic to print the game and bring it to life! They have been great to work with, going out of their way to help us get the information we need to put Colossal Blob in your hands.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
We completely understand that not everyone is in a position to help fund the campaign. However, there are still ways you can help Colossal Blob! You can show your support by sharing this Indiegogo page, the Facebook page, or the video from the campaign with your friends on Facebook, Twitter or in person!

About Us

When Richard was young, he lived in Detroit. The area he lived in was unsafe, so he and his sister had to stay inside a lot of the time. He spent most days watching monster movies and playing games. He also formed his silly sense of humor from clowning around at school during that time, trying to make people laugh. As he got older he wanted to take his love of silly humor, monsters and games and put them together somehow. Colossal Blob became that “somehow,” as it combines all of these things into one!
Danielle doesn’t consider herself a bookworm, but rather a book dragon! Danielle's love of reading lead to her super active imagination. As a kid she imagined that she owned all sorts of fantastic pets and creatures. She would have loved to own a little blob! Danielle really enjoys smaller, silly games and she used her experience from playing those games (and her imagination) to help shape Colossal Blob into what it is today.",23.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Game</h3>
<p>Collie of Duty was originally created in May of 2011. Its humble beginnings were some card sleeves and pieces of paper with really bad art. After nearly two years of testing and tweaking (and contracting an awesome artist), it's ready to be published!</p>
<p>Technical Stuff: 3 - 6 players, 20 - 30 minutes</p>
<p>This game is all about the sheep. Herd sheep from the pasture and add them to your pen, but watch out for wolves! The other collies will also try to stop you in any way they can, even if it means spraying you with water to distract you! Play cards to power up your pen with special sheep and bonuses. Every draw is a risk, though, because some cards shake up the whole game! (Literally; one of the cards is an earthquake.)</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why You Should Buy It</h3>
<p>In its two years of playtesting, only one person has not liked Collie of Duty. When asked why, he said that it was too cute and too happy! So he liked it but wanted to be manly and standoffish. Collie of Duty has been to conventions across the southeastern United States and has always been met with great enthusiasm! </p>
<p>Collie of Duty is unlike any other game. It has some leader-bashing aspects found in Munchkin and scoring that's a little bit like Nuts, but there is no game on the market with this much special flair. Where else can you send a pack of feral Corgis after your opponents or tempt them with persuasive puppy eyes?</p>
<p><strong>Autographed Art</strong></p>
<p>Certain contribution levels offer signed 4''x6'' prints of actual art featured in the game.  Pictures of these drawings will be featured in the gallery (the artist is finishing up the last of them).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Please Spread the Word!</h3>
<p>Whether or not you choose to put money towards this game, please share this campaign with anyone that may be interested! The more Collie of Duty players there are worldwide, the merrier!</p>

Recently graduated student of computer-science, I started creating and working at this game 8 months ago after quitting my job.
It all started years ago after having played endless hours of various games. I have never found that special x-factor that makes the game perfect, so I've decided to start my own little universe and try to design bits of every awesome gameplay I've encountered and bring them together in one game.

<h3>Update:Monday February 11th, 2013</h3>
<p>We've in the final 40 hours of our campaign! If you have been holding out, now is the time to share and/or donate and help us out. We'd love to break $1000, even if we don't make our goal. This has been an exciting experience so far, and hope you decide to be a part of it!</p>
<h3>Update: Saturday January 26th, 2013</h3>
<p>OK, so we're down to the last 17 days of the campaign and we've added a Perk that I think you'll find hard to resist. If this looks like an app you'd enjoy using-one that you might download for $.99 in the app store, then simply donate at the $1 level and you'll get it for free when it's released. This way you help us make sure the app gets made, but you don't extend yourself. Think of it as a pre-sale! We hope you will take advantage of this if you've been thinking the project sounds cool but just didn't want to donate more. Thanks!</p>
<h3>Update: Tuesday January 22nd, 2013</h3>
<p>Hey guys, we just put up the new video detailing the features and interface on onSchedule Alarm, along with some of the science behind the project. If you're having trouble viewing the video above, go here to see it over at vimeo: <a href=""http://vimeo.com/57913062"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/57913062</a></p>
<p> It's crunch time and we really need your help. With three weeks left in the campaign we've got a long way to go before making our goal! Anything you can spare to donate is fantastic. Otherwise if you could share this page or just the video with your friends, that's extremely helpful. Thanks!</p>

<h3>Update: Friday January 18th, 2013</h3>
<p>Welcome @TheNerdyGymRat podcast listeners! On Monday we plan to release a video showing the app's UI and features in detail, but before then I wanted to give a brief rundown of the concept behind the app and how it'll make your life better.</p>
<p>onSchedule Alarm is an app that is designed around the waking up process. Most alarms treat waking up as an instantaneous event that occurs due to a shock to your system, in the form of the alarm sound. Science shows us a better way. At Spark Development we see waking up, like going to sleep, to be a process with multiple stages. Jumping straight to wakefulness from sleep is jarring and painful, both physically and psychologically. Let us look briefly at what happens when you sleep.</p>
<p>There are 5 brain stages of sleep. 1-4 get progressively deeper, as your brain frequencies drop as low as half a hertz. The last stage is REM sleep, when your brain and body are actually quite active, with elevated blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle contractions. When the melatonin in your body begins to decline in early morning, the REM cycles become longer, eventually lasting up to an hour. When you wake up naturally and pleasantly, your brain has a chance to cycle up from whatever level it's in, until it is in an acceptable place to become conscious. </p>
<p>Since REM tends to include largely beta waves, which is what we predominantly have when alert and awake, we often wake up from a dream and remember parts of it. Unless, that is, we have to wake up at an arbitrary time, which could yank us straight from Theta or Delta, causing distress and sometimes disorientation. So onSchedule offers a variety of different features, all of which you can enable or disable, to assist in the gradual and natural waking process, irrespective of when you have to get up. An example could be the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You set your alarm for 6AM.</li>
<li>At 5:45 a low modulated tone begins softly, gradually increasing in frequency and volume over 15 minutes. Brain entrainment will cause your mind to 'follow' this frequency up, bringing you out of your deepest level, up toward a waking brain pattern. Increased dreams in this time are expected.</li>
<li>At the same time, either a pulsing light in sequence with the tone, or a steadily increasing warm glow will show on your phone's screen, to simulate sun rise.</li>
<li>A relaxing tone will sound. Something pleasant and relaxing, but new. With your brain at an elevated state, it will naturally listen to this new sound and begin to process what the sound represents (water, frogs, birds, etc)</li>
<li>Your selected alarm sound will tone at 6AM. Although you can select a harsh tone if needed, over time your brain can adjust to answer to a much softer and less jarring tone. Your brain was prepped in previous steps, and now is ready to get up.</li>
<li>Once the alarm tones, a pleasant voice reads you the weather report, the time, and the headlines from your favorite news source or tech blog.</li>
<li>If you hit snooze, it will be silent for 30 seconds, and then play an alpha wave pattern, increasing in volume over the snooze interval time that you set. This is to prevent you dropping back down to theta or delta, where you'll miss your second alarm. After the interval your alarm and voice alerts play again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, this sounds very complicated, and from a development and research perspective it is somewhat complex. However, the beauty of having a project lead by someone committed to design and UX is that we make it simple for you to use. There are many alarms with many great features, but the ones with the best features are often the hardest to use. In the upcoming video we'll show you how easy it is to set up onSchedule Alarm.</p>
<p><strong>Where does the funding go?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the funding is devoted to the actual development of the app. I am committing my time as a designer to handle all the visual and UI elements, but the programmer must be paid! The rest will go toward further testing of the app in sleep studies where we will be monitoring brain patterns in response to various combinations of tone, frequency, and stimulus. It's important to us that this works, because so many people have a hard time feeling good in the morning. We believe we can help change that, but we need your help to get there! Please give whatever you can, and we'll be eternally grateful. Thanks! Old info is below :)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> Although this is our first app, I have 15 years professional experience both running my own business and acting as a professional designer and art director. My partner has as many years in top level (undisclosed) engineering applications.</p>
<p>I believe this application could affect a great many people who have trouble waking up. It can also just make for a more fun and energizing start to the day! I'm personally excited to use it, and I hope you will be to. As we get a little farther into production I'll start to let out specific features, since it'll be too late then for copycats to catch up.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Alright guys, I've rambled enough! If you can't tell I have a lot of passion and energy for this, so if you could, let that encourage you to share the project and get the word out! If you think it worthy of course; I'd never ask anyone to endorse something they weren't interested in themselves! Indiegogo has useful sharing tools built in too. If you'd rather just donate your talents to convert the app to another platform once its built, that'd be great too! Thanks so much, and rock on! -Anthony</p>

Vote for/Follow ""The Lady"" on Steam GreenlightWeb Volg on YouTubeOur campaign is over, thanks to anyone who viewed the videos and played the demo, and especially thanks to those who contributed. The game will be releasing this May/June on DESURA, Greenman Gaming, and several other online distros. The only way to get the demo now is through my website: http://www.mprart.net/mprarthallucinations/ What is ""The Lady""?The Lady is a very dark and unique 2D Surreal/Puzzle /Adventure game, with Horror elements (For Windows PC exclusively). The game features hand drawn character art , photographic backgrounds, stop-motion themed animation, and a hauntingly abrasive analog soundtrack by the creator of the game, Michael Patrick Rogers . The game is being programmed/developed by the talented Roger Levy.The game is a short and surrealist journey that takes The Lady through a series of fever dream like hallucinations, while being at odds with her own inner struggles with anxiety and depression. She encounters multiple versions of herself throughout the game, unsure of who to trust. The gameplay is Inspired by classic SNES and Turbo Grafx16 type games. The difficulty in gameplay will be brutal, reminiscent of old school games, such as Ghost N Goblins. The game features side-scrolling exploration and arcade-style battles, playing in letterbox full screen HD. Press & Development Documentation I've done several interviews about the game recently.

<h3><span><strong>The Story</strong></span></h3>
<p>You are for hire. <br/>You live in a ravaged and a dangerous solar system.<br/>Some centuries ago many solar systems were connected together using wormhole techology. <br/>Wormhole generators were used to create a wormhole and connect it to the nearest solarsystem. A space ship would go through the wormhole, set up shop and construct a wormhole Stabilizer on the other end, thus connecting the two solar systems. Using this method dozens of solarsystems were connected, explored and settled.<br/>Then everything went to hell. A rapture. The Stabilizers stopped working for some reason. The wormholes became unstable, chaotic and destructive. Each stabilizer became a eye in a storm. <br/>These storms, centered around the stabilizers would send waves of destruction out into the solar systems, disconnecting them from each other and wrecking havoc to everything in them. Waves of destructive energy would sweep the solar systems, gravity would shift at random points, massive energy surges would appear out of nowhere and wormholes would appear at random points in the solar system. <br/>Ships, stations and planets were not safe. Destruction ran rampart. Ships disappeared, stations were ripped apart and planets crumbled under massive gravitational waves. <br/>But mankind survived. Not everything was destroyed. Stations survived, ships escaped and people lived. People rebuilt and multiplied. Space has become a rough place to live in. <br/>Destroyed planets are now massive asteroid belts and vast areas are dangerous to travel due to corrosive elements and abnormal space activity.</p>

<p>   During these three years,
we have developed our own technology of virtual reality and augmented reality
for mobile devices, this technology (Patent Pending) allows us to locate spaces
and virtual elements geo-located with an unseen high quality in augmented
reality applications. This technology is capable of representing large amount
of virtual elements in scene, without influencing the performance of your
mobile device.</p>
<p>   Based on this technology
and with a truly enthusiastic and team, we have decided to step higher, we have
moved all the development team to what we really like, MAKING VIDEOGAMES!</p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/393426/files/20140225070002-Copias2.png?1393340402"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 413px;""/></p><p>    PLvsM originated from the idea
of ​​being able to experience a RTSG (RealTimeStrategicGaming) in real life,
feel the battle, with units being deployed around us. Enjoy a face to face game
with a good friend at an open space (public park or garden at our house), or
even a stranger on the other side of the world and see what he is seeing. Strategy
takes part of this; you could see where the enemy has deployed its units in
order to take advantage of the situation, defending or attacking.</p>
<p>   This game
type has been with us since computer development started, lets imagination and
creativity take part in this. Living this in first person is an exciting
experience. Why we should not take a really well known game gender and really feel
each new unit we generate, each new construction we build, each new enemy we
burrie?</p>
<p>    We desire to create this same experiences
on you, on the player, and of course, this experiences need to be highest possible
quality. For this, we need your help, having the right amount of investment involves
an improvement in all aspects of game development, human resource recruitment,
incorporating elements such as better quality modelling, appropriate
and original soundtracks or overall higher performance. Even your own ideas could
be part of this ambitious project. </p>
<p>The laws of a RTSG have not changed, we all know them,
but we want to take those laws ... Out of our locked room.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/393427/files/20140225070103-THEBATTLEFIELD.png?1393340463"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3></h3><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fy9zgx6XjJeU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dy9zgx6XjJeU&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fy9zgx6XjJeU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>Test GPS tracking and synchronization.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/393508/files/20140225073507-BATTLEPOSITION.png?1393342507"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">   Obviously, the battlefield is the real world surrounds
you, all kind of attack, defensive, exploration or civilian units would be deployed
in your well known environment. The general rules of running a complex RTSG are
taken into consideration within PLvsM, but with the added bonus of being able
to enjoy all these elements in first person, on your proper skin, around you. Like
a true commander in the battlefront.</span></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">   Our technology allows us to
introduce new elements in the development of the game play, yet impossible to
use in a computer desktop game. The real world would affect the game. For
example, situating units on top of hills or buildings would give the player an
increased field of view because their position is being calculated via GPS
(locking its position, longitude, latitude and altitude) the units would be there.
The battlefield is observed from a higher position. All of this in order to
gain advantage over the enemy.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/384903/files/20140221091913-GPS_RTSG_T.png?1393003153"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As a new unit of the battlefield, “You” are the commander and it would make the difference. The game would consider you as a greater threat; enemy units automatically will attack you if they sight you. To defend you in first person, you can build a moving war unit ""Mech"" and handle it in first person in order to defend you from your immediate attackers, while you are continuously developing a defensive strategy. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">To increase the usage of this unit, will be given to the pilot driving the ""mech"" will receive a bonus. In combat and from inside this war unit, you can build defences at twice the speed than normal.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">    The upgrade system will be one of the most important features in game,
all structures and units could be upgraded to take advantage over your
opponent. By upgrading structures, you will dispose of special units and
characters like the ""Spy unit"". To achieve this you need a predetermined
amount of time and resources. We would implement ""in Game"" acquisitions,
that would boost your performance. For example, you can purchase ""Time
Boosters"" to accelerate the time taken to upgrade structures and units. In
advance we can say you that the full upgraded ""Mech"" will be a truly
Killer Machine...</span></p><h3></h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/393430/files/20140225070141-MechA.png?1393340501"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/395457/files/20140226012544-GENERALASPECTS.png?1393406744"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">  Real time military
strategy game is a game where the user will create infrastructures through
construction units, manufacturers to extract resources and military units
attack and defend their territory. Including units with special abilities.</span><br/></p>
<p>   We are
aiming to create a new type of game, a game where we can see the best of other
games of this genus, including new factors. GPS tracking and other telematic
networks.</p>
<p>   It will
be based on the GPS movement, so the user can move freely around the battlefield
in order to explore and clear the war-fog areas of the unexplored map. We will
have 3 main views in game, one on a 2D map where we have a flat representation
of the units that we are controlling and also the units that we could visualize
of the opponent because of the various in-game methods. The 2nd vision we will
have, will be a 3D vision in which we see virtual objects (units or buildings)
we have ahead. And finally we have another 3D view in which we will be inside
one of the ""mech"" unts, in wich we will be able to perform certain unique
actions.</p>
<p>The main objective of the game is the destruction of
enemy command centre. By doing this, the game is over.</p><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><ul><li>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""> Gathering of multiple resources.</span><br/>
</li></ul><p></p>
<p></p><p>   The generation
of units would be based on the collection of certain resources that would be
spread over the field randomly, also a<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">utomatically, the engine would know where to place the resources </span>intelligently. For example, if there is a lake, no solid resources like metal would be placed in this lake<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">. We could have two main resources such as gold,
oil, metal... (or as many as the development leads us to have). The resources can
be extracted by specific unit and when they are extracted, can be deposited on
the command centre or on other constructions like warehouses. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Once built the
command centre, the collector units automatically seek those resources. </span></p><p></p>

</li></ul><p></p>
<p></p><p>   Having
a game where the vast majority of units will be mechanical (robots, mechs,
robotic and motorized vehicles ... )  are
going to be generated in a factory. These buildings have in visible areas
representative items or icons of their team, with colours.</p>
<p>Infantry units such as heavy or light are generated in
specific barracks.</p>
<p>The maximum number of units for one match would be
400, being total of 400/2 per team. The generation of these units will not be
linked to specific infrastructure, so from the first minute the player might
create as many units as possible. Unit generation would not be instantaneous.
User should take this time into consideration.</p><p></p>
<p></p><ul><li>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Technologies and improvements:</span><br/>
</li></ul><p></p>
<p></p><p>   Technologies
are divided into two sections, one that will be focused on resource issues such
as resource gathering speed and harvesting speed etc ... and on the other hand,
we have military technologies like armour Improvements, improved damage, range <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">etc</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">... Some  are generic and others
might grant ability to units.</span></p><p></p>
<p></p><ul><li>
<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Exploration of combat map :</span><br/>
</li></ul><p></p>
<p></p><p>   Exploration
is carried out in two ways, one, by the moving commander (proper user), or by
sending units (exploration or common) to do patrols or sweeps. The first option
will only be available as long as both players are playing close to each other
because if the separation is greater than 300 meters, it's impossible to move
in the area.</p>
<p>The ability to view enemy's camera will be available
only when spy units are created and sent to enemy territory.</p><p></p>

</li></ul><p></p>
<p></p><p>Playing
a real time strategy game, involves taking into consideration many factors that
may tip the balance one way or another. Should consider the following
structure:</p>
<p>           -Coordinate effective resource gathering</p>
<p>           -Generating
units with available resources. </p>
<p>           -Chosen
game mode (either attacker , aggressive attacker , defender, aggressive

<p>   Developing this type of
game is possible thanks to geolocation technology for augmented reality that
our team has created and financed from several other products. Other customers
have relied on us because we have an ability to perform innovative and
different projects, with surprising results. </p>
<p>We need
YOUR help for this BIG IDEA.</p>
<p>The final release will be available in
spring 2015, little more than 1 year. During our development, we want to show
you the auditions from the special characters in the game and if we finance
this project, the instrumental rock band selected for the soundtrack of the
game. </p>
<p>   Why we need your help? We
are willing to present a magnifficent game, a trully amazing product; the GPS
RTSG. Full of quality details, sound effects and visuals worthy of a high tier video
game that undoubtedly created a new genre, absolutely focused on new mobile
technologies developed and developing, such as augmented reality glasses based
on 4G technology and future devices that use mobile augmented reality for daily
use. Reaching these goals requires greater economic investment that we are not
able to reach, is this point where your contribution can make this game as we
really want it to be.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p>Ideas,
this is the fundamental basis of our project, awesome ideas, different,
innovative and surprising. This is a new game genre, we can reach as far as our
imagination is capable of, every day we discover new elements and incorporate
it on the project. This technology allows us for example to make the drives
appear from under the ground or from the bottom of a lake or the sea. Your
ideas can help exponentially in the outcome + development of the game, share
those ideas with us.</p>
<p><i>What
would you like to see? </i></p>
<p><i>How
would you like to appear the units? </i></p>
<p><i>What
new items that could be added?  </i></p>
<p><i>Considering
that appear YOUR SIDE !</i></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Why
300,000€? </b></p>
<p>Regardless
of the initial funding that we had for the project, the number of ideas
generated around it, has been impressive. This technology allows us to seek
great achievements. One of the greattest goals that we can achieve is the creation
of a global persistent battlefield, so that each player can create possession
zones in the country they live in, remaining unchanged until another player
decides to attack your area. For this purpose it is necessary to contract or acquiring
large persistent servers , estimating a high volume of traffic that they must
support, estimations that we have received re around 173,000€  for the
acquisition of these servers and connecting them. The remaining necessary
capital is divided into several programmers, hiring new modeling professionals,
animation professionals, higher performance Workstations... Also
hiring an instrumental rock band for the soundtrack of the game. </p>
<p>However,
we insist in this idea, not only the investment is important for us, also your
comments, so stay in touch with us!</p>

HESITATE TO CONTACT US TO BRING YOUR IDEAS, WE REALLY NEED THEM FROM YOU.</p><p>.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/393462/files/20140225070850-THEAWARDS.png?1393340930"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/393460/files/20140225070809-Camisetas.png?1393340889"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>HELPER</b> -   Thanks from all the team, you will be a part of our beta testers forum and we would send to you also an special PLvsM avatar.</p>

But even if we do not get that goal, we will not stop working on every detail of the project to get it. Every Euro that is invested, every comment written, and every idea presented here, are respected and valued by us. And they are, and will be essential for this project ... Thanks for your support"".Now commented on Vandal , sincere thanks for your contribution.   Manin
Company is a small software studio with big ideas, for three years we have
developed many applications on different platforms (iOS, Android and Windows),
focused on the general aspects of industry, we have focused our ability to be
continually working, government entities, medical surgery and the development
of virtual environments using our augmented reality engine. Applications such
as ""Mercedes- Benz
Comercial Valencia"" or
""Museum of Valencia Local Police""
guarantees our history, large companies have relied on our projects.
   During these three years,
we have developed our own technology of virtual reality and augmented reality
for mobile devices, this technology (Patent Pending) allows us to locate spaces
and virtual elements geo-located with an unseen high quality in augmented
reality applications. This technology is capable of representing large amount
of virtual elements in scene, without influencing the performance of your
mobile device.
   Based on this technology
and with a truly enthusiastic and team, we have decided to step higher, we have
moved all the development team to what we really like, MAKING VIDEOGAMES!    PLvsM originated from the idea
of ​​being able to experience a RTSG (RealTimeStrategicGaming) in real life,
feel the battle, with units being deployed around us. Enjoy a face to face game
with a good friend at an open space (public park or garden at our house), or
even a stranger on the other side of the world and see what he is seeing. Strategy
takes part of this; you could see where the enemy has deployed its units in
order to take advantage of the situation, defending or attacking.
   This game
type has been with us since computer development started, lets imagination and
creativity take part in this. Living this in first person is an exciting
experience. Why we should not take a really well known game gender and really feel
each new unit we generate, each new construction we build, each new enemy we
burrie?
    We desire to create this same experiences
on you, on the player, and of course, this experiences need to be highest possible
quality. For this, we need your help, having the right amount of investment involves
an improvement in all aspects of game development, human resource recruitment,
incorporating elements such as better quality modelling, appropriate
and original soundtracks or overall higher performance. Even your own ideas could
be part of this ambitious project. 
The laws of a RTSG have not changed, we all know them,
but we want to take those laws ... Out of our locked room.Test GPS tracking and synchronization.   Obviously, the battlefield is the real world surrounds
you, all kind of attack, defensive, exploration or civilian units would be deployed
in your well known environment. The general rules of running a complex RTSG are
taken into consideration within PLvsM, but with the added bonus of being able
to enjoy all these elements in first person, on your proper skin, around you. Like
a true commander in the battlefront.   Our technology allows us to
introduce new elements in the development of the game play, yet impossible to
use in a computer desktop game. The real world would affect the game. For
example, situating units on top of hills or buildings would give the player an
increased field of view because their position is being calculated via GPS
(locking its position, longitude, latitude and altitude) the units would be there.
The battlefield is observed from a higher position. All of this in order to
gain advantage over the enemy.As a new unit of the battlefield, “You” are the commander and it would make the difference. The game would consider you as a greater threat; enemy units automatically will attack you if they sight you. To defend you in first person, you can build a moving war unit ""Mech"" and handle it in first person in order to defend you from your immediate attackers, while you are continuously developing a defensive strategy. To increase the usage of this unit, will be given to the pilot driving the ""mech"" will receive a bonus. In combat and from inside this war unit, you can build defences at twice the speed than normal.    The upgrade system will be one of the most important features in game,
all structures and units could be upgraded to take advantage over your
opponent. By upgrading structures, you will dispose of special units and
characters like the ""Spy unit"". To achieve this you need a predetermined
amount of time and resources. We would implement ""in Game"" acquisitions,
that would boost your performance. For example, you can purchase ""Time
Boosters"" to accelerate the time taken to upgrade structures and units. In
advance we can say you that the full upgraded ""Mech"" will be a truly
Killer Machine...  Real time military
strategy game is a game where the user will create infrastructures through
construction units, manufacturers to extract resources and military units
attack and defend their territory. Including units with special abilities.
   We are
aiming to create a new type of game, a game where we can see the best of other
games of this genus, including new factors. GPS tracking and other telematic
networks.
   It will
be based on the GPS movement, so the user can move freely around the battlefield
in order to explore and clear the war-fog areas of the unexplored map. We will
have 3 main views in game, one on a 2D map where we have a flat representation
of the units that we are controlling and also the units that we could visualize
of the opponent because of the various in-game methods. The 2nd vision we will
have, will be a 3D vision in which we see virtual objects (units or buildings)
we have ahead. And finally we have another 3D view in which we will be inside
one of the ""mech"" unts, in wich we will be able to perform certain unique
actions.
The main objective of the game is the destruction of
enemy command centre. By doing this, the game is over.

 Gathering of multiple resources.

   The generation
of units would be based on the collection of certain resources that would be
spread over the field randomly, also automatically, the engine would know where to place the resources intelligently. For example, if there is a lake, no solid resources like metal would be placed in this lake. We could have two main resources such as gold,
oil, metal... (or as many as the development leads us to have). The resources can
be extracted by specific unit and when they are extracted, can be deposited on
the command centre or on other constructions like warehouses. Once built the
command centre, the collector units automatically seek those resources. 

 Generating Units :

   Having
a game where the vast majority of units will be mechanical (robots, mechs,
robotic and motorized vehicles ... )  are
going to be generated in a factory. These buildings have in visible areas
representative items or icons of their team, with colours.
Infantry units such as heavy or light are generated in
specific barracks.
The maximum number of units for one match would be
400, being total of 400/2 per team. The generation of these units will not be
linked to specific infrastructure, so from the first minute the player might
create as many units as possible. Unit generation would not be instantaneous.
User should take this time into consideration.

Technologies and improvements:

   Technologies
are divided into two sections, one that will be focused on resource issues such
as resource gathering speed and harvesting speed etc ... and on the other hand,
we have military technologies like armour Improvements, improved damage, range etc... Some  are generic and others
might grant ability to units.

Exploration of combat map :

   Exploration
is carried out in two ways, one, by the moving commander (proper user), or by
sending units (exploration or common) to do patrols or sweeps. The first option
will only be available as long as both players are playing close to each other
because if the separation is greater than 300 meters, it's impossible to move
in the area.
The ability to view enemy's camera will be available
only when spy units are created and sent to enemy territory.

Strategy:

Playing
a real time strategy game, involves taking into consideration many factors that
may tip the balance one way or another. Should consider the following
structure:
           -Coordinate effective resource gathering
           -Generating
units with available resources. 
           -Chosen
game mode (either attacker , aggressive attacker , defender, aggressive
defender or balanced)The
units can be arranged on 4 major groups. Within each unit we contemplate
different life value, attack, speed, reload speed , rate of fire , shields,
etc ..... Units should be compared only within its group.

Mechanical and / or motorized ground units

 4.  Defence Turrets
     -Against Heavy units
     -Against Air
     -Against Infantry .The approach of units and buildings for naval battles in areas surrounded by water is one of our objectives, because it really arouse passions such units in a RTSG. Our
main objective is to create the first real-time strategy game based on GPS
locations and augmented reality.
   Developing this type of
game is possible thanks to geolocation technology for augmented reality that
our team has created and financed from several other products. Other customers
have relied on us because we have an ability to perform innovative and
different projects, with surprising results. 
We need
YOUR help for this BIG IDEA.
The final release will be available in
spring 2015, little more than 1 year. During our development, we want to show
you the auditions from the special characters in the game and if we finance
this project, the instrumental rock band selected for the soundtrack of the
game. 
   Why we need your help? We
are willing to present a magnifficent game, a trully amazing product; the GPS
RTSG. Full of quality details, sound effects and visuals worthy of a high tier video
game that undoubtedly created a new genre, absolutely focused on new mobile
technologies developed and developing, such as augmented reality glasses based
on 4G technology and future devices that use mobile augmented reality for daily
use. Reaching these goals requires greater economic investment that we are not
able to reach, is this point where your contribution can make this game as we
really want it to be.
Ideas,
this is the fundamental basis of our project, awesome ideas, different,
innovative and surprising. This is a new game genre, we can reach as far as our
imagination is capable of, every day we discover new elements and incorporate
it on the project. This technology allows us for example to make the drives
appear from under the ground or from the bottom of a lake or the sea. Your
ideas can help exponentially in the outcome + development of the game, share
those ideas with us.
What
would you like to see? 
How
would you like to appear the units? 
What
new items that could be added?  
Considering
that appear YOUR SIDE !Why
300,000€? 
Regardless
of the initial funding that we had for the project, the number of ideas
generated around it, has been impressive. This technology allows us to seek
great achievements. One of the greattest goals that we can achieve is the creation
of a global persistent battlefield, so that each player can create possession
zones in the country they live in, remaining unchanged until another player
decides to attack your area. For this purpose it is necessary to contract or acquiring
large persistent servers , estimating a high volume of traffic that they must
support, estimations that we have received re around 173,000€  for the
acquisition of these servers and connecting them. The remaining necessary
capital is divided into several programmers, hiring new modeling professionals,
animation professionals, higher performance Workstations... Also
hiring an instrumental rock band for the soundtrack of the game. 
However,
we insist in this idea, not only the investment is important for us, also your
comments, so stay in touch with us!

<p>Now it’s time for us to create our own project with Crate’s Odyssey which is an adventure puzzle game developed with the Unreal Engine 3 for iOS and PC. It’s really important for us to make something different than a simple puzzle game, that’s why we implement the adventure part with a real story, a real universe and a real evolution during the game.</p>

<p>At this moment we need 10 000$ to complete our budget. That money will be used to buy hardware and software, and to pay us during enough time to finish the game.</p>
<p>To thank you back for your funds on the project we have some good and unique perks to offer. It’s important for us that every people who believe on that game receive a copy of it as soon as it is available, that’s why we offer the game for only 20$.</p>
<p>Some perks give you special responsibilities on the game: create your own level, give us advice, take decisions etc.</p>

<p><strong>The Game</strong></p>
<p>With a really early demo of the game we won a contest in France called “Game A Niaque”. We were judged by a lot of Video Games Company and we decided to continue the adventure because of all good critics we received that day. “Big potential”, “really original”, “already a professional look”. All critics were really motivating for us. <strong></strong></p>
<p>At this moment, the game is on a good way. We have a playable demo with all gameplay elements working fine. We have tested the game on an Iphone 3GS (30 FPS) and an Ipad 2 (60 FPS) and we have a nice render on both.</p>
<p>We are really confident with that game because we have a really good experience with the Unreal Engine and with iOS games, so we know what we are doing. The game has a nice graphical universe for kids and adults so everyone can play the game easily.</p>
<p>The game is original because it will mix the adventure and the puzzle game. It’s important for us to have a good story and a good evolution during the game (new powers, boss fights etc.). And it needs to have a good replay value that’s why we implement the puzzle game part.</p>

<h3>Spenden statt Weihnachtskarten<br/>
</h3> <p>Danke, dass du vorbei schaust bei unserer kleinen Weihnachtsspenden Kampagne. Wir freuen uns sehr darüber und möchten dir hier kurz die Gründe für die Aktion aufzeigen.<br/></p>
<p>Unzählige Firmen senden dieser Tage tonnenweise Papier und teilweise unnützes Zeug durch die Gegend. Dabei fallen nicht unerhebliche Kosten an. Wir selbst haben in den letzten Jahren teilweise bis zu 1500,- Euro (pro Aktion, exklusive unserer Arbeitszeit) ausgegeben um Weihnachtskarten, Geschenke und Briefe zu verschicken. Einmal hatten wir tolle Lebkuchenkekse die aber zu 80% beschädigt angekommen sind.</p>
<p>Im letzten Jahr haben wir dann mit Kollegen zusammen eine Kampagne zur Unterstützung von Ebola Waisenkindern gestartet. Mit großem Erfolg und über 5300 Euro an Spendengeldern. Trotzdem, waren auch Karten und nicht unerhebliche, 
zusätzliche 
 Kosten involviert die wir dieses Jahr besser verteilen wollen.<br/></p>
<p>Daher haben wir uns für 2015 entschieden, eine kleine Spenden Kampagne zu starten und deinen Anteil der Spende werden wir noch mal oben drauf legen.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Ein Vorteil für Alle!<br/>
</h3>In dem wir auf Grußkarten mit Verpackung, die zusammen spätestens in wenigen Tagen in der Tonne landen, verzichten, die Post entlasten und das Geld einem 
gemeinnützigen 
 Verein (dazu mehr weiter unten) zukommen lassen, entstehen ausschließlich Vorteile für Alle.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Wie funktioniert die Aktion und wie kann ich mitmachen?<br/>
</h3> <p>Eigentlich ist alles sehr einfach und mit den Worten ""You Donate, We Double"" auch schon erklärt. Wir werden jede Spende (bis 2500,- Euro Gesamtsumme) von dir verdoppeln. Also aus 1,- Euro machen wir 2,-. Spendest du 50,-  Euro, machen wir 100,- Euro  draus. Und so weiter...</p>
<p>Zusätzlich haben wir einige sog. Perks mit dabei. Das sind Produkte oder Dienstleistungen, die man bei einer Spende in passender Höhe (oder höher) bekommen kann. Diese sind von der Anzahl aber begrenzt und daher solltest du schnell sein.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Warum machen wir das?</h3>
<p>Uns persönlich und unseren Familien geht es im Grunde sehr gut. Die 
Probleme die sich bei uns hin und wieder zeigen sind meistens nicht zu 
vergleichen mit wirklichen Problemen von anderen Menschen dieser Welt. Gerade in Zeiten wie wir sie gerade erleben.<br/></p>
<p>Wir sind sehr froh darüber, dass es viele Hilfsorganisationen gibt die in vielen Teilen der Welt mit ihrer Arbeit und den tollen Projekten Unterstützung leisten.</p>Da es aktuell unrealistisch ist selbst irgendwo in der Welt Hand anzulegen und Entwicklungshilfe zu leisten, nutzen wir die Möglichkeit zur finanziellen Unterstützung.<br/><br/>
</div><div> <h3>Wohin geht das Geld?<br/>
</h3>Wir sind schon seit Jahren Unterstützer von Plan International, UNICEF und ""Ärzte ohne Grenzen"". Da eine Patenschaft mehr ist als nur ""Geld"" zu spenden, UNICEF der Riese dieser dreien ist, haben wir uns dazu entschieden unsere (und eure Spende) an ""Ärzte ohne Grenzen"" (Deutschland) weiter zu geben. Zufällig ist auch genau diese Idee auf den aktuellen Flyer von Ärzte ohne Grenzen zu finden. (Tatsächlich reiner Zufall)<br/><br/><br/><h3>Noch Fragen?</h3>
<p>Das ist unsere erste eigene Indiegogo Kampagne und daher ist es gut Möglich, dass wir noch Informationen vergessen haben. Wir stehen für dich natürlich jederzeit für Fragen zur Verfügung, entweder hier, via Email oder auf Facebook (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/carmenandingo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/carmenandingo</a>)</p>

<h3>DANKE - VON GANZEM HERZEN, DASS DU DABEI BIST!</h3>
<p>Liebe Grüße</p>

<h3>Donations instead of Christmas Holiday Cards</h3>
<p>Thank you for stopping by at our little Donation Campaign.</p>
<p>Below you find a short description of the WHAT, WHY and WHO.</p>
<p>Almost all companies are sending out Christmas Holliday Cards and other useless stuff during this time of the year. This can be quite expensive. We have had huge costs over the past years for varous different Christmas campaigns. A very expensive one was the one we sent out some cookies. 80% of them arrived broken.</p>
<p>In some of the years we have spent over 1500,- Euros for something not lasting very long. So we decided to do more useful things with that money this year (and maybe the coming years)</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>A benefit for everyone!<br/>
</h3>
<p>While saving on cards and envelopes, we 
additionally disburden the postal service and finally all the money is donated to a nonprofit (see below). So everyone is happy!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>How does it all work?</h3>

Spenden statt Weihnachtskarten
 Danke, dass du vorbei schaust bei unserer kleinen Weihnachtsspenden Kampagne. Wir freuen uns sehr darüber und möchten dir hier kurz die Gründe für die Aktion aufzeigen.
Unzählige Firmen senden dieser Tage tonnenweise Papier und teilweise unnützes Zeug durch die Gegend. Dabei fallen nicht unerhebliche Kosten an. Wir selbst haben in den letzten Jahren teilweise bis zu 1500,- Euro (pro Aktion, exklusive unserer Arbeitszeit) ausgegeben um Weihnachtskarten, Geschenke und Briefe zu verschicken. Einmal hatten wir tolle Lebkuchenkekse die aber zu 80% beschädigt angekommen sind.
Im letzten Jahr haben wir dann mit Kollegen zusammen eine Kampagne zur Unterstützung von Ebola Waisenkindern gestartet. Mit großem Erfolg und über 5300 Euro an Spendengeldern. Trotzdem, waren auch Karten und nicht unerhebliche, 
zusätzliche 
 Kosten involviert die wir dieses Jahr besser verteilen wollen.
Daher haben wir uns für 2015 entschieden, eine kleine Spenden Kampagne zu starten und deinen Anteil der Spende werden wir noch mal oben drauf legen.

  Ein Vorteil für Alle!
In dem wir auf Grußkarten mit Verpackung, die zusammen spätestens in wenigen Tagen in der Tonne landen, verzichten, die Post entlasten und das Geld einem 
gemeinnützigen 
 Verein (dazu mehr weiter unten) zukommen lassen, entstehen ausschließlich Vorteile für Alle.
  Wie funktioniert die Aktion und wie kann ich mitmachen?
 Eigentlich ist alles sehr einfach und mit den Worten ""You Donate, We Double"" auch schon erklärt. Wir werden jede Spende (bis 2500,- Euro Gesamtsumme) von dir verdoppeln. Also aus 1,- Euro machen wir 2,-. Spendest du 50,-  Euro, machen wir 100,- Euro  draus. Und so weiter...
Zusätzlich haben wir einige sog. Perks mit dabei. Das sind Produkte oder Dienstleistungen, die man bei einer Spende in passender Höhe (oder höher) bekommen kann. Diese sind von der Anzahl aber begrenzt und daher solltest du schnell sein.

Warum machen wir das?
Uns persönlich und unseren Familien geht es im Grunde sehr gut. Die 
Probleme die sich bei uns hin und wieder zeigen sind meistens nicht zu 
vergleichen mit wirklichen Problemen von anderen Menschen dieser Welt. Gerade in Zeiten wie wir sie gerade erleben.
Wir sind sehr froh darüber, dass es viele Hilfsorganisationen gibt die in vielen Teilen der Welt mit ihrer Arbeit und den tollen Projekten Unterstützung leisten.Da es aktuell unrealistisch ist selbst irgendwo in der Welt Hand anzulegen und Entwicklungshilfe zu leisten, nutzen wir die Möglichkeit zur finanziellen Unterstützung.
 Wohin geht das Geld?
Wir sind schon seit Jahren Unterstützer von Plan International, UNICEF und ""Ärzte ohne Grenzen"". Da eine Patenschaft mehr ist als nur ""Geld"" zu spenden, UNICEF der Riese dieser dreien ist, haben wir uns dazu entschieden unsere (und eure Spende) an ""Ärzte ohne Grenzen"" (Deutschland) weiter zu geben. Zufällig ist auch genau diese Idee auf den aktuellen Flyer von Ärzte ohne Grenzen zu finden. (Tatsächlich reiner Zufall)Noch Fragen?
Das ist unsere erste eigene Indiegogo Kampagne und daher ist es gut Möglich, dass wir noch Informationen vergessen haben. Wir stehen für dich natürlich jederzeit für Fragen zur Verfügung, entweder hier, via Email oder auf Facebook (www.facebook.com/carmenandingo)

DANKE - VON GANZEM HERZEN, DASS DU DABEI BIST!
Liebe Grüße
Carmen und Ingo Leitner mit Malia


+++ ENGLISH VERSION +++



Donations instead of Christmas Holiday Cards
Thank you for stopping by at our little Donation Campaign.
Below you find a short description of the WHAT, WHY and WHO.
Almost all companies are sending out Christmas Holliday Cards and other useless stuff during this time of the year. This can be quite expensive. We have had huge costs over the past years for varous different Christmas campaigns. A very expensive one was the one we sent out some cookies. 80% of them arrived broken.
In some of the years we have spent over 1500,- Euros for something not lasting very long. So we decided to do more useful things with that money this year (and maybe the coming years)

A benefit for everyone!

While saving on cards and envelopes, we 
additionally disburden the postal service and finally all the money is donated to a nonprofit (see below). So everyone is happy!

How does it all work?
Actually the words ""You Donate, We Double"" says it all. We double up your donation (to a maximum of 2500,- Euro). So we transform 1,- Euro from you into a total of 2,- Euros. You donate 50,-  
Euro, we forward 100,- Euro etc.
In addition, we have some Perks ready for you as well. Products or services from us that we offer in return of the donation. Please be aware that the Workshop Videos are for German Speaking People Only!
Be quick, only a few Perks available

Why do we even bother?
Well, compared to so many people in this world we are very fortuned. Our families and we are doing well so why not support others right?
Thankfully there are many nonprofits out there and in times like these we can at least support one to help them do their (not so easy) job.
For us, it is not very realistic at the moment to head out into the world and do development assistance but it is to support those who do.

Who will get the donation?
We have supported three major 
organizations 
 over the past years: Plan International, UNICEF and 
""Doctors without Borders"".
A sponsorship with PLAN is more than just a donation, UNICEF is very big so we decided to go with ""Doctors without Borders"" (Germany).

Any questions?
Since this is our first own donation campaign there might still be open questions. Do not hesitated to ask us everything you want to know. Either here, via Email or sure on Facebook

<p>It´s been a

defense systems designed to offer protection to entire cities by what they call

<p>The world
is now populated with all kinds of ruthless creatures that have adapted to the

<p>After

a lot of interesting possibilities when developing a character. Or on the other
hand they may wish to stay only with the branches belonging to their initial
class, which is a guarantee that their character will develop properly. Any
character may reset at any time all his skills, and even define tables with
different skill configurations which can be exchanged whenever he is out of
combat. Likewise, he may attach a default computer for use with each table of
skills, that when activated automatically matches the table, to make it more

few seconds, in this time agility type characters will be able to climb to a
balcony-like structure on its back, after that the enemy will get up and keep
fighting and moving around the stage with some players above in real time. The
players who ride also get a damage bonus, but will have to jump from the
structure at some point as the enemy launched an attack that automatically kill
anyone who does not jump in time to dodge. Is not it epic to death? As this is

<h2>Hi! I'm David and I make music.</h2>
<p class=""p1"">When I grew up in a suburb south of Stockholm, Sweden, both of my parents worked professionally with music (they've since retired), so perhaps it was inevitable that one day I would, too.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The starting point was when I got a Game Boy for Christmas. I loved playing games on it and I also really liked the music in those games. Playing along on my parents' piano with the tunes coming out of the machine's tiny speaker not only got me hooked on making music, but also on game music in particular. When I was sixteen, I wrote the music to <a href=""http://www.derekyu.com/?page_id=157"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Eternal Daughter at Derek Yu's website"">Eternal Daughter</a>, my first original soundtrack.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Fast-forward several years (how time flies!) and now I'm trying to make ends meet as a freelance musician.

<h3>Help me release my soundtrack!</h3>
<p class=""p1"">I want to release the music as a stand-alone soundtrack and am hard at work preparing for that. However, my meager independent budget makes parts of that rather tough. That's why I'm running this campaign; to make the finished product as good as possible!</p>
<p class=""p1"">Before releasing the soundtrack, I want to get all 40 tracks mastered by a professional mastering engineer. That way, the music will sound great no matter how or where you listen to it. Also, because there are still people who collect CDs, I'd like to do a physical print run as well - in which case mastering is more or less a necessity.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Both CD mastering and printing are rather expensive, but I've managed to get really good deals on both and I do have some funds dedicated for this already. So, I don't need gazillions of dollars, but I still need another <strong>$1200</strong> on top of what I already have. That covers both mastering, printing and shipping all the physical CDs out.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Everybody loves stretch goals.</h3>
<p class=""p1"">While <strong>$1200</strong> covers mastering, printing and shipping, I would of course be thrilled if the campaign raises even more. So if the base amount is exceeded, I'll go above and beyond:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1800 </strong>and all funders get <em>a selection of Me and My Dinosaur 2 DLC</em>! Extend the game with plenty of new content (otherwise sold separately). Also, the CD will come in <em>a glossy, beautiful four-panel digipak</em>! This will be a once-in-a-lifetime collectible - any further reprints will be in sleeves. I'll even sign your copy if you want to. ;)</li>
<li>
<strong>$2500 </strong>and I'll <em>write and record an original song based on themes from the soundtrack</em> - with lyrics and everything! - as a separate single that <em>all funders get for free before everybody else</em>!</li>
<li>
<strong>$3000</strong> and I'll make <em>a set of sheet music arrangements</em> of selected songs from the soundtrack <em>included with every physical CD</em>! It'll feature several different ensembles, from pop band to string quartet and more. It'll also include the original song mentioned above!</li>
</ul>
<p>If the grand total ends up <em>even higher</em>, well, I'll figure something out! If, on the other hand, I <em>don't end up raising even the base amount</em>, I'll figure that one out too. Also, everyone will be refunded if the base amount isn't reached.</p>
<h3>More ways to help out.</h3>

<div>
<p>Perhaps you feel you just can't afford to put down any money right now, and <em>that's fine</em> - I totally understand. I know what it's like to have to think twice about buying anything except the bare necessities. It sucks, but that's just the way it is sometimes.</p>
<p>If you want to do something anyway, though, I'd appreciate it so much! For instance, you can <em>spread the word about the campaign</em>. Use Indiegogo's built-in sharing tools, tell your friends or post about it on your blog, Twitter, Facebook or wherever you cool kids hang out.</p>

<p>      Have you been playing new browser games lately? It feels like I'm watching a movie, not playing a RPG.. I feel sorry that they are called RPGs. You have no choices, beside equipping items, and they are giving you one-way to improve your hero and even fights became automatic!</p>
<p>     What's the fun in it?</p>
<p>     This game is different, more old school, becouse Dakija RPG grants you choices you deserve to have in the RPG game.  Dakija gives you full control of your moves in combat, many ways to improve you hero the way you want and even upgrade weapons the way you want! Enough of these cheap one-way-one-story lines of codes called games, it's time for a deep and full of choices RPG!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><img alt=""Current Progress"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.part.lt/img/4ed503b6fcb49805ac14f8b0eb409571855.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Current Progress""/> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>       In the spring of 2012 the game had open testing in Alpha #1, where community tested combat and leveling system, skills, spells,  shopkeepers in town and hero page. Players sent some really nice ideas on how to improve this game. Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>       Now, after a half year, I’m having Closed Alpha #2 testing.  Player-versus-monster also known as PvM has been improved a lot. You can test exploring system, dungeons, quests, more monsters, more items, better balanced skill trees and spells, item upgrading system, in game teacher - called scholar.</p>
<p>  Few things that are on my to do list or currently are being coded:</p>
<ul>
<li>PvP fights (both online and offline, working now),</li>
<li>Party Travelling (up to 5 people exploring),</li>
<li>Challenging game even after you reach max level,</li>
<li>Guild competition (5x5 battles until death),</li>
<li>Guild’s leveling system (skill trees for guilds, some skills may be used in guild battles),</li>
<li>Monster invasions,</li>
<li>Fully interactive NPCs</li>
<li>Epic main quest and many subquests,</li>
<li>Mercenaries and NPCs joining you in battles.</li>
<li>Translated into many languages</li>
</ul>
       Also, I’d like to tell you, why I started creating this game.
<p>        I was playing RPGs for  many years and was one of those guys, who never stopped experimenting with builds. My brother had 1 fighter and felt happy with that. I didn’t. I searched, had 10 champions and wanted to know everything about the RPG I was playing, so I could outsmart others. But these games were limited, not only to the builds and the depth of the game, but they mostly had 1 or 2 ways for building a good champion. After failing at finding the perfect game for me, I decided to create one myself.</p>
<p align=""center"">   </p>
<p>       <strong>Focus One - Freedom and tactics</strong>       </p>
<p>       Game focuses on creating you hero in variety of ways. How I do that? Well, check the game, you can wield any weapon or any armor as long as you can carry it. Weight limits that, but you can always rise your strength. “But” again, if you rise it too much, you my fall behing to those who balanced other statistics better. And so on… I got current combat system for a half year and I’m still now sure what is the best way to build heroes.</p>
<p>        When battle starts you may be weaker, but end with victory, because you  know the game mechanics, use skills or spells in the right time, fallback when needed and so on. That’s how I’m killing hard monsters now that at the beginning seemed to be unkillable for my level.</p>
<p>        Furthermore, there is a thing, called balancer (my definition, simply because it keeps the balance of the game). Currently there are six balancers, meaning, you have access to 6 different skill trees. Every time you level up, you gain some balancer points and it’s up to you to decide what skills you want to get by rising appropriate balancer. Currently there is more than 200 skills in all 6 skill trees. Have fun searching for the best combinations!</p>
<p> Currently done: ~60%. Still 2 or more classes to add, skill and spells to balance.</p>
</div>
<div style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""> </div>
<div style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">       <strong>Focus Two - Interesting quests</strong>
<p> </p>
<p>       Growing your hero is one of the main focuses, but not the only. Second thing that is important for me, is freedom of will when doing quests. I think that player should have some choices on how to do specific quest. Let’s say NPC-A asked you to kill a NPC-B, but didn’t explain you why, but reward is tempting. You can go and kill NPC-B, but! you can talk with him first, try to understand what’s going on and try to convince to live in peace or just kill NPC-A if NPC-B gives you a better reward… These things takes time to code, but this quest is 10x more valuable than quests where you have to kill X monsters and click – do quest, click – do quest. If you like brainless games, you probably won’t like this game.</p>
<p>        Currently done: ~33%. Created quests system. Quest will be added in time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>        <strong>Focus Three - Best PvP System</strong></p>
<p>        This will be the hardest to achieve. Currently you can test 2 classes and 6 subclasses, though archer is coming soon and monk class after. They will be different, but somehow, I will manage to balance them with community’s help.</p>
<p>        Also there is a point, where I think other MMO lacks balance is guild battles. They are mostly about the quantity, not the quality. That’s why my guild battles will only allow 5x5 and may the best win (not the most) !</p>
<p>        I think guild battles should be epic with all those possible hero/guild skill combinations and many tactics you can use to reach the victory.</p>
<p>        Currently done: Working on basic pvp system, still much to do.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>       Currently I’m thinking of early to mid spring on 2013.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What type of game is it?</strong></p>
<p>Browser based RPG fantasy game with turn based combat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What type of computer I need to play the game?</strong></p>
<p>All you need is supported browser – Mozilla, Chrome, Safari or Opera.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I play the game?</strong></p>
<p>From 12-18 of 2012 you can. Check here: <a href=""http://www.dakija.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dakija.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why flexible campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Becouse this is my first crowdfunding campaign ever, I was kind of afraid of going all or nothing (you see people donate something, but you get nothing if it fails). Now I would definitely go for fixed funding. (2012-12-19)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The game is just like many others browser games?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t think so. Game has unique mechanics and play style. Got a traveling system I’ve never seen on any browser game. Same goes to upgrading system. Furthermore, differently from other browser RPGs, Dakija has many skills and spells to choose from, a lot of items to find and unique dungeon’s system.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If you have to choose combination of games, that Dakija is alike?</strong></p>
<p>I would say heroes-ragnarok-baldur’s gate-my fantasy hybrid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How are you going to make it?</strong></p>
<p>Well I’m already more than a half way. I could use money-kick from crowdfunding for faster development, though, if it fails, I’m still developing the game, because at this points I just don’t have B plan, I’m going directly to my dream!</p>
<p>p.s. found on the net that a lot of life-changers didn’t have plan B.. :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you think $12,000 USD is enough to finance a ""full-paid team"" and go open beta in spring?</strong></p>
<p>Here is my plan: I need about 6 months to release open beta. Average salary in my country is ~800$. My team needs full-time designer and half-time writer. Currently I'm using dedicated server which costs ~30$ a month. But my dream server would cost around 75$ a month (it is possible to get 50% discount for the first year). I can live with low expenses, such as 200 or 300$ (as I do now). So lets sum everything up:  6x800 (designer) + 6x400 (writer) + 12x75$ (server) + 6 x 300 (me) = 9900$.  20% of 12000$ (total of 2100) is force majeur - unexpected costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your english in game s***, when you going to improve that?<br/></strong></p>
<p>As soon as I can afford employing a native english writer. If I succeed in this campaign, texts will be enchanted before next alpha release.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>      <strong>Thank you very much for your support.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>   <strong>   I wish you all the best and don’t be afraid of your dreams. Make them come true!</strong></p>

Story:
     Embark on a journey to a brand new world and change the fate of a people needing redemption.Set in a land far away, Dakija follows your story as a hero in a quest to restore order among the land and the people: a land of advanced technology and civilization; a people evolved into higher conscious beings.     Chaos ensued after the forces of evil, hidden for a long time, rose through a volcanic explosion marking their ascension deep from the undergrounds.     Kingdoms will be shattered.     Terror will reign.     But out of the ashes, a hero will rise and restore a world thrown into chaos.     Unleash your power within. Discover the ancient powers you alone possess. Stop the evil forces to finally restore the order the ancients once knew.
 
Gameplay:
     Dakija is an online browser-based fantasy RPG game. Following a turn-based combat format, players choose their type of hero and develop their abilities, skills, spells and other attributes as he progresses in the game. Train a Fighter or Magician (Archer and Monk - coming soon). Cast over 100 spells of different types. Develop more than 200 sets of skills. Equip more than 400 weapons and 200 armors as you fight the evil forces, discover ancient knowledge and save the land of Dakija!   
 





  



 
     The game starts off with simple turn-based battles, but as your journey goes deeper into the heart of the story, you will encounter lots of exciting quests, build a unique team of mercenaries and NPCs and enjoy hours of pure RPG experience.
     From the halls of the castles to the heart of the woods, there is no single way to finish the quests that await you.
     Build a character of your own in hundreds of different ways and expect more options from the developers.
     Most of the online RPG games you see so far requires a lot of money for you to progress and gain advantage over other players. Dakija believes in fair play and will provide equal opportunities to every gamer wanting a level playing field.
     No ridiculous amount of money involved.No unfair advantage. This is pure gaming experience at its best.
 



     At its very core, Dakija is an interplay of fantasy, RPG and the love for developing. The creator of Dakija conceived this game out of pure passion and the need to share this to the gaming community.      In a desire to bring this to the world, this game was built from scratch, timeless devotion and the vision of giving every player an online RPG they can call their very own.
     The creator promises unceasing development to bring endless hours of the finest gaming experience to every player out there.
 



     Currently, the game is being rolled out at its very alpha stage. That means a lot has been made to come up to this point, but that also entails a lot of work still needs to be done.


     Among my top priorities right now is to find a co-founder designer, who will be involved in the game design. The second on the list would be a dedicated server so that the valuable feedback would be captured and that progress would not be halted. Another important thing is to code, code and code more! I made this game out of my years of experience and passion for online games and I would continue to do so! The last on my list of future plans is to hire a writer who can help me create the world of Dakija and unfold hours of epic story-telling. 

 

 
 


Bare minimum - 500$ - is required for finishing coding pvp system and entering final alpha #3 stage.

 


At 1000$ - Game will reach Open Beta on mid of March! Thank you!

 


At 1500$ I’m planning on getting pro graphics on archer class and enchantments in dungeon and upgrading page.

 


At 2400$ all year long fast server preordered. Faster gameplay = more satisfaction!

 


At 2800$ writer enchants my texts in a professional manner.

 


At 3500$ many more enchants in graphics such as different outlook when using different equipments, profesionally-painted merchants and NPCs (that are currently black now).

 


At 4500$ REAL GOAL. Starting developing version for tablet computers and mobile devices. because current game's design is well fit for mobile devices I would like you to play this game anywhere!

 


At 6000$ will search for programer for half-time job to help me with game’s code.

 


At 8000$ an outstanding 5x5 guild battles on end of May!  


At 10000$ additional two classes decided by community (besides archer and priest).

 


At 12000$ creating a full-paid team for faster game development (check FAQ section for more information).

 


At 25000$ We got the stable background for half of the year as a team, our main goal – perfecting an epic game.

 


      Have you been playing new browser games lately? It feels like I'm watching a movie, not playing a RPG.. I feel sorry that they are called RPGs. You have no choices, beside equipping items, and they are giving you one-way to improve your hero and even fights became automatic!
     What's the fun in it?
     This game is different, more old school, becouse Dakija RPG grants you choices you deserve to have in the RPG game.  Dakija gives you full control of your moves in combat, many ways to improve you hero the way you want and even upgrade weapons the way you want! Enough of these cheap one-way-one-story lines of codes called games, it's time for a deep and full of choices RPG!
 
 
 
 
       In the spring of 2012 the game had open testing in Alpha #1, where community tested combat and leveling system, skills, spells,  shopkeepers in town and hero page. Players sent some really nice ideas on how to improve this game. Thank you.
 
       Now, after a half year, I’m having Closed Alpha #2 testing.  Player-versus-monster also known as PvM has been improved a lot. You can test exploring system, dungeons, quests, more monsters, more items, better balanced skill trees and spells, item upgrading system, in game teacher - called scholar.
  Few things that are on my to do list or currently are being coded:

PvP fights (both online and offline, working now),
Party Travelling (up to 5 people exploring),
Challenging game even after you reach max level,
Guild competition (5x5 battles until death),
Guild’s leveling system (skill trees for guilds, some skills may be used in guild battles),
Monster invasions,
Fully interactive NPCs
Epic main quest and many subquests,
Mercenaries and NPCs joining you in battles.
Translated into many languages

       Also, I’d like to tell you, why I started creating this game.
        I was playing RPGs for  many years and was one of those guys, who never stopped experimenting with builds. My brother had 1 fighter and felt happy with that. I didn’t. I searched, had 10 champions and wanted to know everything about the RPG I was playing, so I could outsmart others. But these games were limited, not only to the builds and the depth of the game, but they mostly had 1 or 2 ways for building a good champion. After failing at finding the perfect game for me, I decided to create one myself.
   
       Focus One - Freedom and tactics       
       Game focuses on creating you hero in variety of ways. How I do that? Well, check the game, you can wield any weapon or any armor as long as you can carry it. Weight limits that, but you can always rise your strength. “But” again, if you rise it too much, you my fall behing to those who balanced other statistics better. And so on… I got current combat system for a half year and I’m still now sure what is the best way to build heroes.
        When battle starts you may be weaker, but end with victory, because you  know the game mechanics, use skills or spells in the right time, fallback when needed and so on. That’s how I’m killing hard monsters now that at the beginning seemed to be unkillable for my level.
        Furthermore, there is a thing, called balancer (my definition, simply because it keeps the balance of the game). Currently there are six balancers, meaning, you have access to 6 different skill trees. Every time you level up, you gain some balancer points and it’s up to you to decide what skills you want to get by rising appropriate balancer. Currently there is more than 200 skills in all 6 skill trees. Have fun searching for the best combinations!
 Currently done: ~60%. Still 2 or more classes to add, skill and spells to balance.

 
       Focus Two - Interesting quests
 
       Growing your hero is one of the main focuses, but not the only. Second thing that is important for me, is freedom of will when doing quests. I think that player should have some choices on how to do specific quest. Let’s say NPC-A asked you to kill a NPC-B, but didn’t explain you why, but reward is tempting. You can go and kill NPC-B, but! you can talk with him first, try to understand what’s going on and try to convince to live in peace or just kill NPC-A if NPC-B gives you a better reward… These things takes time to code, but this quest is 10x more valuable than quests where you have to kill X monsters and click – do quest, click – do quest. If you like brainless games, you probably won’t like this game.
        Currently done: ~33%. Created quests system. Quest will be added in time.
 
        Focus Three - Best PvP System
        This will be the hardest to achieve. Currently you can test 2 classes and 6 subclasses, though archer is coming soon and monk class after. They will be different, but somehow, I will manage to balance them with community’s help.
        Also there is a point, where I think other MMO lacks balance is guild battles. They are mostly about the quantity, not the quality. That’s why my guild battles will only allow 5x5 and may the best win (not the most) !
        I think guild battles should be epic with all those possible hero/guild skill combinations and many tactics you can use to reach the victory.
        Currently done: Working on basic pvp system, still much to do.
 
 
 
  
 
       Currently I’m thinking of early to mid spring on 2013. At this time game should have it’s open beta: full first town,  balanced skill trees, PvM and PvP combat, a bunch of lands to explore and quests, upgrading system, guilds. If my team will do well, you will also see guild fights, mercenary system and many other features.
 
 

 
      After donation, I will have your email and this email will be in database with assigned bonuses you will get after registration in open beta.
The Pride Points you will receive -  ingame currency that helps you in leveling and traveling, though, to keep balance, they don't influence fighting system directly.
 
 
 
       You can also help me by spreading the word for your friends, family and RPG fans. Also be so kind and press Like for Dakija RPG on Facebook .
       Also you can use indiegogo sharing tools.
 



 
What type of game is it?
Browser based RPG fantasy game with turn based combat.
 
What type of computer I need to play the game?
All you need is supported browser – Mozilla, Chrome, Safari or Opera.
 
Can I play the game?
From 12-18 of 2012 you can. Check here: http://www.dakija.com
 
Why flexible campaign?
Becouse this is my first crowdfunding campaign ever, I was kind of afraid of going all or nothing (you see people donate something, but you get nothing if it fails). Now I would definitely go for fixed funding. (2012-12-19)
 
The game is just like many others browser games?
Don’t think so. Game has unique mechanics and play style. Got a traveling system I’ve never seen on any browser game. Same goes to upgrading system. Furthermore, differently from other browser RPGs, Dakija has many skills and spells to choose from, a lot of items to find and unique dungeon’s system.
 
If you have to choose combination of games, that Dakija is alike?
I would say heroes-ragnarok-baldur’s gate-my fantasy hybrid.
 
How are you going to make it?
Well I’m already more than a half way. I could use money-kick from crowdfunding for faster development, though, if it fails, I’m still developing the game, because at this points I just don’t have B plan, I’m going directly to my dream!
p.s. found on the net that a lot of life-changers didn’t have plan B.. :)
 
Do you think $12,000 USD is enough to finance a ""full-paid team"" and go open beta in spring?
Here is my plan: I need about 6 months to release open beta. Average salary in my country is ~800$. My team needs full-time designer and half-time writer. Currently I'm using dedicated server which costs ~30$ a month. But my dream server would cost around 75$ a month (it is possible to get 50% discount for the first year). I can live with low expenses, such as 200 or 300$ (as I do now). So lets sum everything up:  6x800 (designer) + 6x400 (writer) + 12x75$ (server) + 6 x 300 (me) = 9900$.  20% of 12000$ (total of 2100) is force majeur - unexpected costs.
 
Your english in game s***, when you going to improve that?
As soon as I can afford employing a native english writer. If I succeed in this campaign, texts will be enchanted before next alpha release.
 
 
      Thank you very much for your support.
 
 
      I wish you all the best and don’t be afraid of your dreams. Make them come true!",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>StarForge is a game about gathering resources, building bases, crafting, and surviving on an alien planet. Earth's star is dying and humanity transferred as much technology and resources as possible and left on a one way mission to populate another planet.</p>
<p>StarForge was inspired by Halo, Warcraft 3, Borderlands, Terraria, and Minecraft. It borrows elements from the RTS, FPS, RPG, Voxel Builder, Tower Defense, and Physics Sandbox genres. We are building a dark and serious universe and want the player to live out their own unique story on the procedural planet.</p>
<p><strong>Procedural Weapons -</strong> StarForge features procedural weapons. This adds a large variety to the weapons you find in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Procedural Infinite Voxel Terrain -</strong> Dig an endless tunnel, fly out to the far reaches of space, and come back again. Hide out in endless forests or harvest them. Mine to your heart's content and discover the different biomes.</p>
<p><strong>Procedural 3D Tilesets -</strong> Build anything you want with our unique 3D Tilesets. You can create cities, towns, villages, bridges, forts, underground bases, trenches and much more. </p>
<p><strong>Underground/Surface/Space Gameplay -</strong> Build a tower that ascends into the clouds, through the atmosphere, then into space, and do this in realtime. </p>
<p><strong>Physics Sandbox -</strong> We are designing every object in the world to be fully dynamic. Fell trees in by launching your vehicle on them. Construction, vehicles, players, objects, everything is physically simulated. Do whatever you want and enjoy what happens.</p>
<p><strong>Physics Movement -</strong> Our movement model is designed closely around the real biomechanics of biped locomotion; it can simulate jumping, running, climbing, wall jumping, wall running, crawling and pretty much any other behavior all without the use of any state driven code. The result is a more human look and feel, and a character that is equipped to intelligently react to dangers far beyond what conventional movement code was designed to handle. It also features a full body IK system.</p>
<p><strong>Loot and Survive -</strong> Before the humans landed countless weapons and armor were sent to Atlas. You will find loot chests littered throughout the land, you will need their contents to survive. We will be implementing a perm death system, so you will have to be careful. Every decision matters. </p>
<p><strong>Customizable Characters -</strong> We plan on allowing you to cloth and armor your character and change his or her appearance. You are unique and your character should be too.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic World -</strong> Enjoy dynamic weather patterns, a 24 day and night cycle and a real time atmosphere.  Creatures will also behave in a realistic matter, scavenge for food and return to their hives at different times of day. </p>
<p><strong>Resources and Economy -</strong> There will be many different resources in StarForge. However, the player can only hold so much at a time. </p>
<p><strong>Vehicles, Turrets, Furniture, Fences, ect. -</strong> We plan to support a lot of different content. So you can decorate your house or make your fort tough.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer &amp; SinglePlayer -</strong> We will have both modes playable in the game.  Enjoy emergant gameplay where you land on the planet, meet other players, build villages, and go to war. Play whatever role you want. It's your world and you can do whatever you want in it.</p>

<p>We've been developing StarForge in our free time for nearly 2 years. Nearly 5 months ago we put a video of it up on Youtube and we got a ton of great comments and support from everyone online.  Since then we decided to quit our jobs and work full time on StarForge.</p>
<p>In the meantime we have been working really hard on the design and backend of the game. We now have a prototype of the game and we hope to turn it into a complete game.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what our game looked like only 5 months ago -</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://youtu.be/YxBSYit49c8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/YxBSYit49c8</a></strong></p>
<p>We chose IndieGoGo because it's a very open funding platform, and we hope to raise enough money to make a fully fledged Single Player &amp; Multiplayer for our game. Here is what we will use the money for:</p>
<p><strong>Survival:</strong> Rent, food, and internet to keep 3 developers working full-time for a year.</p>

<p><strong>Software:</strong> Help us afford the essential software needed for pushing this game forward.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> We plan to make a robust multiplayer experience. </p>
<p><strong>Single Player:</strong> In order to do a proper single player game you need good A.I and lore. We have extremely innovative ideas on improving A.I beyond what you have seen in traditional games, and good things take time to develop.</p>
<p><strong>Music &amp; Audio:</strong> We will hire LoudCore to compose a full fledged soundtrack to the game. </p>
<p><strong>Art:</strong> Were looking to purchase some high quality creatures, characters, and weapons from some great 3D art talents we've got lined up. We want you to be able to feel the StarForge universe.</p>
<p><strong>Polish:</strong> We generally don't like releasing anything unless it has undergone a lot of polish. So your money will also go to making everything the best it can be.</p>
<p>We've decided to use IndieGoGo because we feel we can only innovate without barriers by remaining independent. We enjoy communicating directly with you and we love all your ideas for the game.

<p>Paraversume is a location-based massively multiplayer online game for portable devices, combining strategy and role-playing mechanics to form a unique player experience. The game features an interactive storyline that is molded by the players’ actions. We also intend to give players power over the evolution of the experience: We in the Paravesume team believe that the only way to make an enjoyable social game is to openly interact with the community.</p>
<p>The project began in November 2011, and thus far much of the ground work is done. The basic architecture is there, but the graphics and game logic are still in a work-in-progress stage.</p>
<p>Paraversume will be released first for iOS devices (iPod 3/4 gen, iPhone 3GS+, later on iPads) and probably later for Windows Phone. Android version is in consideration also.</p>
<h3>Us</h3>
<p>We are a small group of game enthusiasts, developers and artists from Finland. In the past we’ve seen games with somewhat similair concepts, but were left cold by either technical excecution or poor service of the players in general. So we decided to make a game of our own, the kind of game we would like to play – the kind of game we believe you will enjoy playing.</p>
<p>Paraversume is the first title we’re working on as a team, but our programmers boast well over a decade’s worth of experience in other software development.</p>
<h3>We Need</h3>
<p>Managing a massively multiplayer game is no small task. We need servers, people tending the game, addressing problems and bug reports, taking in ideas and plotting the course of the game. We need sound design and music. And we're sure other things will appear along the way.</p>
<p>We want to be able to run the game as our main job and not as a side hobby. We don't want to release the game without knowing that we can keep it running for some time. Naturally the game being a freemium title (free to play for all, some premium things available on purchase) we expect most revenue to come when the game is running.</p>
<p>We set the target very low. This does not reflect the actual amount of money we need to run the game. So please don't think we have got enough if we hit the target. You can support us even after that. Also it's to ensure that we don't have to pay extra to Indiegogo if we don't meet some bigger target.</p>
<p>To give you some understanding of the costs: we estimate $4000 will allow a developer and an artist to work on the game for a month without much distraction (Indiegogo etc take their share, currency rates, taxes...)</p>
<h3>You Get</h3>
<p>Depending on the amount of money you contribute we offer you several things. You get your name to our contributors list.You get in-game resources. We will not offer anything that would make you more powerful than people starting later on or otherwise distort the balance of the game, other than earlier access to the game.</p>
<p>We thought about giving some exclusive art work, posters etc, but printing and posting takes a lot of money and we think everyone would rather support the game and not put their money into some random stuff.</p>
<p>We also welcome companies to sponsor the game. We offer possibilities to advertise either in the game story via product placement or other types of advertising. You can contact us privately too, if you like. First come first serve! We will naturally reserve the possibility to not accept some sponsors, including gambling, competing games etc. But we're open to everything nice!</p>
<p>You can also purchase the packs containing the possibility to choose others to start in the beta too and give them out however you want to, except that you can't sell them or require any purchase to get them. They can be given out e.g. in free raffles or to your employees or friends. As long as it's free.</p>
<p>Remember: you can also buy several different perks if you like!</p>
<h3>Sharing Is Caring!</h3>
<p>Please share the project with the Indiegogo's share buttons! Spread the word! Even if you can’t contribute money, every bit of publicity helps. Thank you so much for your interest, and <strong>let’s make a kick-ass game!</strong></p></div>","Paraversume

<b><a href=""http://contessaonline.com/what-is-what-happened-at-the-con/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">What Happened at the Con</a> </b>is a card-matching game created by two of ConTessa's staff members - Ethel Buster and Sarah Richardson. Role-play is essential to the fun of WHatC!  There is no right or wrong way to do it, but the idea is to tell a fantastic story as you and your friends come up with ways to ensnare each other and devise clever twists to escape the trickiest of situations.<br/><p>The game comes in its own tuck box with a complete set of rules and a deck of full-color cards. ConTessa art cards match each other. Goblin cards skip people or reverse directions. Dice cards – some with suggestions and some blank –  let you create role-play scenarios and trap your opponents. But be careful! They can stack up and you might be the victim of your own plot. Just use your imagination to create your own story of What Happened at the Con.<br/></p>

</div></div>","About ConTessa's Founder
Stacy Dellorfano has been kicking around the tabletop world since her days as a delinquent band geek in High School, skipping class to hide in the band room and play AD&D with her friends.
In the late 90s and early naughties, she worked in the video games industry, spending her late nights patching up games like EverQuest and writing translation tools to make awesome games in other languages. While her day job is now outside the gaming industry, she is also pursuing her newest secondary job as a publisher of tabletop RPGs and related merchandise and events, including her own RPG, Precious Dark. 
Getting more women into tabletop RPGs is near and dear to Stacy's heart. Her passion is bringing the ideas, talent, and enthusiasm of all of those women out of the shadows and into the light, where they belong. She's dedicated to not only bringing the RPG industry into the modern world of web and software development, but also providing platforms for new and up-and-coming designers and developers to showcase and expand their amazing work.
About ConTessa 
ConTessa is an apolitical space for women to lead their own tabletop gaming convention, deciding which games they want to run and which panels they want to moderate. ConTessa is a celebration showcasing women who play, create, and love tabletop games. 
In addition, it provides women with an outlet to experience gaming as gamers, setting aside for a few fun-filled days the women's issues discussions that often dominate our time and energy in the hobby. While women run all aspects of ConTessa, anyone can join in the fun - playing in games, joining a panel, or watching events. The convention is held online, spanning the globe, open to all. Google Hangouts keeps things accessible - no need for a high-end computer or expensive specialized equipment, just click and play.
ConTessa Registration Central
This year, we're adding a new tool that allows you to view events, sign up to play or attend, and manage your schedule - all from a central location. Modern and user-friendly design is important to us, but it takes time and skill. Your support will help us build the best version possible, using modern web development practices and technologies. You can check it out, here, now, and register new events early!
ConTessa Blog & Archives
The ConTessa Blog is home to all of our news and announcements, as well as a central clearinghouse for news and updates about women in gaming. The blog also stores the archives of our previous games, panels, and events, allowing people to watch at their leisure. You can help with maintenance costs by supporting this ConTessa campaign.
We strive to make ConTessa professional and polished, and that includes paying for high-quality artwork and marketing to deliver a one-of-a-kind online gaming experience. It isn't the cheapest way to go, but we think it is worth it to broaden the appeal and attract new players to online gaming. 
ConTessa merchandise makes great door prizes. Our swag was extremely popular during ConTessa 2013, and we're expanding the program this year.
When you purchase one of the perks from this IGG campaign, you will also be donating a matching Goodie Bag to be given out in your name during ConTessa.



 

The 'What Happened at the Con' Card Game

What Happened at the Con is a card-matching game created by two of ConTessa's staff members - Ethel Buster and Sarah Richardson. Role-play is essential to the fun of WHatC!  There is no right or wrong way to do it, but the idea is to tell a fantastic story as you and your friends come up with ways to ensnare each other and devise clever twists to escape the trickiest of situations.The game comes in its own tuck box with a complete set of rules and a deck of full-color cards. ConTessa art cards match each other. Goblin cards skip people or reverse directions. Dice cards – some with suggestions and some blank –  let you create role-play scenarios and trap your opponents. But be careful! They can stack up and you might be the victim of your own plot. Just use your imagination to create your own story of What Happened at the Con.

Every key in every layout is remappable and can be configured as a macro. Any key can have special behaviors if you tap once, several times or hold it.Our software and firmware is open source. This means that anyone can make an improvement or program their own plugins and the whole community can benefit from it. We’ve divided the spacebar into 4 and added 4 extra keys under it.

IT'S BEEN AN AMAZING JOURNEY WITH ZOMBIE WITH A SHOTGUN.  IT ALL STARTED WITH A SIMPLE DREAM BY CREATING A ZOMBIE FILM. I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF HOW FAR THIS PROJECT WOULD'VE TAKEN ME.  I HAD MANY WONDERFUL PEOPLE THAT HELPED ME DURING THIS PROCESS. I TRULY THANK THEM AND EVERYONE THAT SUPPORTED ME AND ZOMBIE WITH A SHOTGUN. ONE MORE THING, I ALWAYS EXPLAIN TO MY FANS THAT IF I CAN DO IT, ANYONE CAN AND THAT'S THE TRUTH. FOLLOW YOUR HEART AND YOUR DREAMS...
ZOMBIE WITH A SHOTGUN THE VIDEO GAME!!!
IT ALL STARTED IN THE YEAR 2012 AS A WEB-SERIES AND A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER WE'VE CREATED A COMIC-BOOK SERIES.
WE DIDN'T STOP THERE....IN 2016 WE DECIDED TO GO ON A CAMPAIGN TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE FEATURE FILM ZOMBIE WITH A SHOTGUN!
NOVEMBER 27 2019  ZOMBIE WITH A SHOTGUN DEBUTED ON AMAZON PRIME VIDEO.
TO WATCH FILM ON TUBI ~ ZOMBIE WITH A SHOTGUN
TO WATCH FILM ON AMAZON ~ ZOMBIE WITH A SHOTGUN
IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT HERE'S THE TRAILER....

 
THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED IF IT WASN'T FOR ALL YOUR AMAZING SUPPORT!!!
 
AND NOW.....
WITH YOUR AWESOME HELP WE WOULD LIKE TO RAISE MONEY TO RELEASE....
ZOMBIE WITH A SHOTGUN 
THE VIDEO GAME!!!!!!

Zombie with a Shotgun is going to be that zombie GAME where all the rules we know about zombie GAMES go right out the window.​

It begins: 
You’re getting chased! Quickly you hurry through the front door of an old apartment complex.For a second you think you’re safe, but better think again! Accomplices to the ones that are after you are already inside, hiding in the dank hallway for you to show up.You have a room here, where you have your belongings. You left the apartment-key on the dresser so get to your place , pick up that key and lock the door behind you!You pull a tucked away handgun and prepare to face your enemies.
GAME ON!!!
Shoot down the bad guys, pick up some weapons, pet and rescue some rabbits and be careful around all those zombies roaming 'round the dark. They're hungry!...

Feel like wasting ammo? Blast away your enemies, cupboards, chairs, vases, and whatever else gets in the way! Though some things may be better left alone as they'll keep you covered from enemy fire - at least a little while.
 
Depending on how many stretch goals we reach the more levels, story and characters we'll add to the game. These are the 10 levels we've planned for and with your help, we'll reach to make every single one a memorable experience! 

READ BELOW AS WE ASK FOR YOUR HELP TO GRAB ONE OF OUR WONDERFUL PERKS!

At $12 540 another level will be built and the plot will thicken. With every new level, more story will be revealed and more characters will pop in, both friendly and those ready to put a gun in your face.

At $13 080 there will be new weapons and we'll add another character.

When going for $15 240 there will be yet another level added for Aaron to run around in.

<div>So this is our Livestream charity donations page! If you  came here by accident, here is some basic info for you:<br/><br/>Our names are Sean (Prawnilious) and Tads (taddio) and we are staff members on the Minecraft server Multicube! Multicube has recently hit the 1 million unique players mark, and to celebrate we're hosting a 24 hour livestream for charity to celebrate the occasion. (Stream is at <a href=""http://www.twitch.tv/multicubelive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.twitch.tv/multicubelive</a>). We will be collaborating with some great youtubers during the stream; including <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/ThezRhino"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ThezRhino</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/Champwan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Champwan</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/16bitDec"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">16BitDec</a>.</div>
<div>As Multicube has a large community of players, we asked them what charities they wanted to see us donate money to. The charities selected were Special Effect, Extra Life and PennysForGSD. We're hoping to raise £1000 for these charities.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Special Effect</b> is an amazing UK based charity who provide gaming equipment for people with severe disabilities. <a href=""http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/</a><br/>You only need to watch a few of their youtube videos from their channel to really grasp how big a difference they make to the lives of these people.</div>

<b>Extra Life </b>is a charity that started out as a 24 hour gaming marathon like this one to raise money for the Texas Children's Hospital. Since then, the charity has grown with more and more gamers supporting the charity to raise money for their local Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. <a href=""http://www.extra-life.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.extra-life.org/</a><br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FrHSZ_82wiJg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrHSZ_82wiJg&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FrHSZ_82wiJg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>

<div>When you donate to this IndieGoGo campaign, your money will go towards these charities and these charities only.

If you  came here by accident, here is some basic info for you:Our names are Sean (Prawnilious) and Tads (taddio) and we are staff members on the Minecraft server Multicube! Multicube has recently hit the 1 million unique players mark, and to celebrate we're hosting a 24 hour livestream for charity to celebrate the occasion. (Stream is at http://www.twitch.tv/multicubelive). We will be collaborating with some great youtubers during the stream; including ThezRhino, Champwan and 16BitDec.
As Multicube has a large community of players, we asked them what charities they wanted to see us donate money to. The charities selected were Special Effect, Extra Life and PennysForGSD. We're hoping to raise £1000 for these charities.


Special Effect is an amazing UK based charity who provide gaming equipment for people with severe disabilities. http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/You only need to watch a few of their youtube videos from their channel to really grasp how big a difference they make to the lives of these people.
Here, Ben and Harry are just two examples of the many people that they've helped:






Extra Life is a charity that started out as a 24 hour gaming marathon like this one to raise money for the Texas Children's Hospital. Since then, the charity has grown with more and more gamers supporting the charity to raise money for their local Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. http://www.extra-life.org/



PennysForGSD is a charity suggested from one of our own staff members who has GSD Type VII. PennysForGSD is a charity that raises money for Glycogen Storage Disease research and awareness in order to try and find a cure for this rare, and sometimes fatal disease. http://pennysforgsd.org/

Here's a link to their Story http://pennysforgsd.org/our-story/


Your contributions to this fundraising page will help so many lives out there. You will be helping a disabled child in the UK to be able to play video games, with technology that your donations help to fund. Your donations will be helping a child in a US hospital get the treatment they need, as well as helping to find a cure to a very rare disease. 
When you donate to this IndieGoGo campaign, your money will go towards these charities and these charities only. Once all the contributions are collected and our stream ends, we'll split up the money and send each charity a third of the total funds gathered. Even if we don't reach our goal, we'll send any money that is raised towards these charities. A small difference made is better than no difference made. 
We hope that you will help out these charities in any way possible, whether it be:1. Contributing to this IndieGoGo page2. Sharing the IndieGoGo Page/ Livestream with friendsor 3. Simply take your time to look at their sites and get to know what work they doMake sure that you're watching the stream when we hit milestones on our way to our goal! We'll be giving away:
1000 cubics at 100 pounds raised!10 Cosmetic Tokens at 250 pounds raised!50 Cosmetic Tokens at 500 pounds raised!Pro lifetime rank at 750 pounds raised!Pro+ lifetime rank at 1000 pounds raised!Special shoutout to 'BlackKeys' for making the beautiful pitch image
Few extra details for you guys:The money will be going to a designated bank account (clear of any personal funds) and will this bank account is designated for this purpose only. Once the contributions have been put in this account, we will donate the funds divided equally to each charity. The new PayPal option is linked to the same designated account.Once this is done we will try and confirm that the money has reached the charities through receipts/ email contact or other methods.",0.0,3,"1 Campaign

<li>
<strong>There will be multiplayer?</strong><br/>Ancient Cities uses a player controlled time velocity that does not fit well with multiplayer. This game is closer to a city builder with strategy elements than it is to a base camp game like AoE.<br/><br/>If the game works very well and we have funding in the future we could consider a spin off, or a multiplayer mode with fixed time, but we will not compromise single player experience in any case. Multiplayer is not a priority for us at this moment.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>There will be combat?</strong><br/>Yes, in the first release there will be combat in the form of raids, but it will be optional.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Can I evolve my city from Neolithic, to Rome, Middle Ages or beyond or can I play with Tenochtitlan?</strong><br/>Not in the first release.First release will start with a nomadic tribe and cover Neolithic to the Bronze Age start in Atlantic Europe. If the first release works well and we can continue development we will expand the game to other ages/cultures, step by step.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Will there be modding support for the game?</strong><br/>Not for the first release.<br/>But we know how important modding is for this kind of games, so it will be added later.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What will be the system requirements for this game?</strong><br/>At this stage of development is too early to say, still lots of optimizations are needed, and lots of features are going to be added.<br/>The game already provides a full range of typical quality configurations though.<br/>Currently i5 CPU and not too old discrete 2GB GPU is the actual minimum for low settings, but this may ( and will ) change a lot.<br/><br/><i>We will know actual minimum requirements near the final release<br/>Integrated GPU are not going to be officially supported.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Will there be Linux or Mac version?</strong><br/>Only Windows version is planned at this moment.<br/>Other platforms are to be determined in the future if they have commercial sense for us.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>When this game will be released?</strong><br/>Release date is planned for late 2018<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>There will be Early Access or open Alpha?</strong><br/>Early Access is not planed and alpha will be closed.<br/>We think alpha is a development stage, not a product to sell.<br/>There will be a closed Beta for people who backed in any crowdfunding platform with the beta access reward.<br/> </li>
</ul><h3>Kickstarter FAQ</h3><p><br/>This section is dedicated to all the people who already backed us on the Kickstarter (KS) campaign.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Are the goals and rewards the same as the Kickstarter campaign?</strong><br/>This Indiegogo campaign is designed to work as a time extension of KS, so goals and rewards are the same, but those we considere obsolete.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What if I already backed the game in the previous Kickstarter campaign?</strong><br/>Then you already backed the game and we thank you again ;)<br/>You DO NOT need to back again.<br/><br/>If you backed as Citizen on KS, any extra funding achieved here will improve the game, and your gameplay experience as well.<br/><br/>If you backed as C<i>hief, Lord, Shaman </i>or<i> Deity </i>on KS, you will be granted with all expansions unlocked in this campaign as well.<br/><br/>If you have any question, please don't hesitate to contact us.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Can I upgrade my KS pledge?</strong><br/>Yes, you can:<br/><br/>If you are a Kickstarter ""Citizen"" and want to upgrade to ""Chief"" follow <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/2156517/x/16927354?secret_perk_token=7e40edea"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">this link</a> and pledge for the secret perk in the perk list ( yes, just like that ).<br/><br/>If you are a Kickstarter ""Citizen"" and want to upgrade to ""Lord"" follow <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/2156517/x/16927354?secret_perk_token=61a58500"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">this link</a> and pledge for the secret perk in the perk list ( yes, just like that ).<br/><br/>If you are a Kickstarter ""Chief"" and want to upgrade to ""Lord"" follow <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/2156517/x/16927354?secret_perk_token=5a66b44d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">this link</a> and pledge for the secret perk in the perk list ( yes, just like that ).<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What about Paypal?</strong><br/>We will try to support Paypal as well, for all of you who don’t use credit card.<br/>This will be supported on Ancient Cities website in the near future.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Are you not going to return to the work until the end of this campaign?</strong><br/>Greenlight and Kickstarter campaigns took us all of our time.Now, with the basic funding achieved on KS, we are working again full time in the game.<br/>This means that we will be answering questions less frequently and campaign updates will be related to our daily development progress.<br/> </li>
<li><p><strong>Is not the funding obtained in KS enough?</strong><br/>​After taxes and fees we are getting around 90.000€ in order to continue developing the game. This is enough to keep working the original team and make the base game, but not for hiring more people or improving our working conditions. More funding means better development and finally a better game.</p></li>

As you can check in the pledge chart, only Chief, Lord, Shaman & Deity will get ""unlocked expansions"". Any other unlocked stretch goal is for every game owner.* Exclusive Backer DLC: Unique building for backers that will not  affect gameplay .Everyone will know that you are a backer looking at your screenshots or game videos.* ""Deity"", ""Shaman"" and ""KS Beloved Chief"" will have beta access preference.* Uncasual Pass Includes all games, expansions and DLCs that Uncasual Games may release in the future.We love tech, strategy games, history, archaeology and cities. We dream, as you do, with a gorgeous strategy city simulator, focused in history and realism, that lets the player develop its city through the ages in a credible and immersive way.This sounds too ambitious? Definitely.But we think everything can be done, if you move steady, step by step. Our solution is to not even try to do it all at once, but to build each time-frame and location as a full expansion over one common platform, with all the content, from assets to game-play features, needed for that historical simulation.As a whole, Ancient Cities is a long-term project.If successful, we expect Ancient Cities to become a powerful game platform for next developments, moving us more and more into the realms of history, exploring different places and ages around the world with you: Bronze Age, Mighty Ur, Classic Greece, Egypt, Rome or Middle Ages.Let's dream. Join us if you want ;) We have chosen to start at the origin of cities, in the Neolithic era because It is logic and highly suitable for the project:New eras will introduce new gameplay and game features, just as in real life.Neolithic allows us to face all the game features ( religion, society, architecture, politics or warfare ) in their most simple form compared to other ages, and that makes it a perfect suit for a development team with the limited resources we have.A natural step that fits historically and technically.We are developing our own custom engine and gaming technology for Ancient Cities because it allows us to render what we envision: thousands of items on the screen at the same time with nice fps, offering the players breathtaking images of their cities.Both, game-play and detail, are important to us.If you share our vision, this is a great opportunity to make it happen.We are already working on it! This project started as a project of two friends, one coder and one artist, both with passion for technology, video-games and history. Both with a long career, years of expertise in custom 3D engines and full of new ideas. We consider to use Unity or UDK for AC in the beginning, but we realized that AC requirements needed a custom technology focused on managing thousands of entities in the screen. For us this was a new challenge in our careers, and we love that.We have been developing the technology behind Ancient Cities and AC Neolithic working full time in our own homes for more than a year, running on our own funds.Two more people, a programmer, and a sound designer, have joined us recently as they love the project as much as we do.We believe in what we are doing, and truly love it. In the last months, we decided to start showing our work while growing a community around the game.We started our ""almost"" daily development updates on twitter https://twitter.com/_AncientCities . You should take a look there if you really want to know us, the project, and a small but wonderful community ;)With this community supporting us and the game progressing well, but still in early alpha, we decided to try Steam Greenlight before it shut down.What happened there was completely unexpected, it was the best reward for all our efforts to date: In the last 4 days of Greenlight the game skyrocketed #2 position, with a 95% of positive votes and hundreds of nice comments.You can check our Greenlight page here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=854046403 Currently, the game is in the early alpha stage.This means that only some of the final features are implemented and almost none of them are finished or polished.Yet we have done lot of work building the basis of the tech and gameplay, both still unfinished but beyond the prototype stage.There is a ton of work ahead in order to add all the content we have planned so we still need your help to grow the team and to ensure an on-time and polished release, while keeping our creative freedom.Ancient Cities first crowdfunding succeeded after surpassing the 100.000€ goal and reaching 125.000€ in a previous Kickstarter  campaign. But this campaign was very short not allowing a lot of people to discover it in time. This IndieGogo campaign is planned to work as a tool to extent funding time, to allow backers to reach more stretch goals, as well as allow people that missed the original campaign to help fund the game and getting them the possibility of joining the closed Beta.*Please, if you are a Kickstarer backer check the KS FAQ at the bottom of this page. We are a small team and we want to spend our time improving the game for you, designing, coding, modelling, animating and texturing... not selling you cups or T-shirts.Managing physical gifts is very time consuming.Why not an early alpha pledge?Lots of people asked for an early alpha access. We know you want to play the game right now, but this would imply tons of community management and technical support. This effort, dedicated to keep people playing instead of evolving the game features towards release specifications, could seriously compromise the project.Of course there will be an alpha when the time comes, we need it to improve the game, but we need it to be very controlled. An alpha is a development stage, not a product to sell.In addition, we consider that the game should be played as intended, and current status does not represent what we have in our minds and in our design sheets.We really hope you all to understand our decision about this pledges. We have decided to reward your help with what we set out to make; a better game.What kind of pledge are we offering?What we are offering to you is the game itself, finished, completed and polished with a discount on final price ( 40€ ), and a mention in the game credits as a backer in AC game platform. A backer's especial section in the game website is planned too.Of course, we will continue with our daily development updates, with frequent gameplay videos about new features to keep you up-to-date at every moment until the game is done.10 top backers will hold a distinguished place in the backer’s section in the game credits and on the website.No mention that we will be always open to discuss gameplay ideas and features with you.  Current FeaturesThe game is a city/world simulation where you can change time progression from normal speed to several time-lapse velocities.

 LLuis, Ancient Cities sound designer and musician, takes his job very seriously.We love that and you will love it too when you have the game in your hands!This is our first PC game but... We have years of experience with similar technologies. Also, many features has been already completed during the last year, so we have no doubt we can finish the work.We are developing our own tech, but... We have created many 3D engines in our careers, working for private companies and VR research labs, and even as a hobby!We are a team of four running on our own budget... So we need to grow, and we need funding, this is the main reason to be here.What is our greatest shortcoming? We are perfectionists, even worse, we like that!

This game is closer to a city builder with strategy elements than it is to a base camp game like AoE.If the game works very well and we have funding in the future we could consider a spin off, or a multiplayer mode with fixed time, but we will not compromise single player experience in any case. Multiplayer is not a priority for us at this moment.

Can I evolve my city from Neolithic, to Rome, Middle Ages or beyond or can I play with Tenochtitlan?Not in the first release.First release will start with a nomadic tribe and cover Neolithic to the Bronze Age start in Atlantic Europe. If the first release works well and we can continue development we will expand the game to other ages/cultures, step by step.

Will there be Linux or Mac version?Only Windows version is planned at this moment.Other platforms are to be determined in the future if they have commercial sense for us. 

When this game will be released?Release date is planned for late 2018 

There will be Early Access or open Alpha?Early Access is not planed and alpha will be closed.We think alpha is a development stage, not a product to sell.There will be a closed Beta for people who backed in any crowdfunding platform with the beta access reward. 
Kickstarter FAQThis section is dedicated to all the people who already backed us on the Kickstarter (KS) campaign.

Are the goals and rewards the same as the Kickstarter campaign?This Indiegogo campaign is designed to work as a time extension of KS, so goals and rewards are the same, but those we considere obsolete. 

What if I already backed the game in the previous Kickstarter campaign?Then you already backed the game and we thank you again ;)You DO NOT need to back again.If you backed as Citizen on KS, any extra funding achieved here will improve the game, and your gameplay experience as well.If you backed as Chief, Lord, Shaman or Deity on KS, you will be granted with all expansions unlocked in this campaign as well.If you have any question, please don't hesitate to contact us. 

Can I upgrade my KS pledge?Yes, you can:If you are a Kickstarter ""Citizen"" and want to upgrade to ""Chief"" follow this link and pledge for the secret perk in the perk list ( yes, just like that ).If you are a Kickstarter ""Citizen"" and want to upgrade to ""Lord"" follow this link and pledge for the secret perk in the perk list ( yes, just like that ).If you are a Kickstarter ""Chief"" and want to upgrade to ""Lord"" follow this link and pledge for the secret perk in the perk list ( yes, just like that ). 

What about Paypal?We will try to support Paypal as well, for all of you who don’t use credit card.This will be supported on Ancient Cities website in the near future. 

Are you not going to return to the work until the end of this campaign?Greenlight and Kickstarter campaigns took us all of our time.Now, with the basic funding achieved on KS, we are working again full time in the game.This means that we will be answering questions less frequently and campaign updates will be related to our daily development progress. 
Is not the funding obtained in KS enough?​After taxes and fees we are getting around 90.000€ in order to continue developing the game. This is enough to keep working the original team and make the base game, but not for hiring more people or improving our working conditions. More funding means better development and finally a better game.",69.0,1,"1 Campaign

Have you ever played a jigsaw game on your tablet? Usually it looks completely, utterly 2D and you have to move awkward tiles around.

Join the Resistance
Resistance: Cross of Lorraine is first full pen & paper RPG by Library of Ancien Scroll (http://ancientscroll.pl)

This is a game about trust & betrayal, courage & sacrifice.

Take a role of French resistance fighter during II World War. Organize Your team, go underground, fight for Your family and country.


""Whatever happens, the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished.ï¿½
- General de Gaulle, Appeal of 18 June 1940


Players
French resistance gathered people of different classes, religions and political views.

In R:CoL You may play as a teacher, cabaret singer, veteran, spy, shopkeeper etc. But those are PC's ï¿½real lifeï¿½ backgrounds. In fact they form an underground resistance movement cell. Their goal: fight Nazis

Work together, fight together

Every PC has different level of Resources. It can be Arms, Medicine, Contacts etc. 

Those Resources are extremely important, because Nazis plunder everything. Without proper level of Resources, missions PCs get from HQ are impossible. 

So gather Your Resorces every possible way: buy on black market, steal from an enemy, or simply improvise. Than share You Resources with other freedom fighters in Your team. Together You are more powerful

You will need also a safe haven, underground hide out to plan Your actions, store weapon and rest. Invest Your Resources to make Your hide out stronger!

Trust, risk, betrayal


You are hunter, but also a prey for Nazi secret police. Every resistance action expose You to the risk of denunciation. But it is not only Your risk - whole team or even whole net of resistance can be endangered. Trust is the most valuable currency in the resistance. 
Do You  trust 100% your team mates? Will You die for them? Will they die for You? Are you sure that the is no Nazi spy in Your team?

Maybe Your fellow fighter's loyalty decreased after he had to choose: another mission or getting food for his family?

Gameplay has been designed to let you jump into the action, whether you’re a casual player or competitive streamer.

</div><h2>Strategic Simultaneous Turns</h2><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/t8duK7SRZVPUMVSkjx/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p></div><p>Simultaneous turns are a special game mechanic for Infinity Heroes. Players initiate their planning phases simultaneously with everything resolving at once. In this system, based on our previous game Infinity Wars, a whole new level of strategy has been added to the card strategy genre that forces players to predict and outmanoeuvre their opponents. Support? Attack? Defend? The choice is yours!</p><p>Taking turns in order is simple, there’s usually one or two good moves and the rest are subpar. However, with simultaneous turns, a psychological element is added (like Poker) where your opponent’s turn directly affects how you play.</p><h3>WINNING YOUR BATTLES</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3IFCQ1GqNGM5JemmO7/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p><p>The battlefield has limited spaces available giving a greater importance on unit placement.

Gameplay has been designed to let you jump into the action, whether you’re a casual player or competitive streamer. Games can also be played at a competitive level without spending a cent. 

 
Strategic Simultaneous TurnsSimultaneous turns are a special game mechanic for Infinity Heroes. Players initiate their planning phases simultaneously with everything resolving at once. In this system, based on our previous game Infinity Wars, a whole new level of strategy has been added to the card strategy genre that forces players to predict and outmanoeuvre their opponents. Support? Attack? Defend? The choice is yours!Taking turns in order is simple, there’s usually one or two good moves and the rest are subpar. However, with simultaneous turns, a psychological element is added (like Poker) where your opponent’s turn directly affects how you play.WINNING YOUR BATTLESThe battlefield has limited spaces available giving a greater importance on unit placement. If too many small unit cards are placed down rapidly, players may miss out of the opportunity to play more impactful units. Thus, moving units between lanes can (and will) become more difficult.This is balanced out by a hand refill mechanic where 4 cards are refilled at the end of each turn. This provides players with adequate time and information to react to an opponent’s action.Through the implementation of lanes, we’ve constructed a MOBA-like experience to allow for strategic decisions to respond to specific threats on the battlefield.CRAFT PERSONALIZED HEROES, SPELLS AND CARDSThis feature has been made with creatives in mind. We’re providing players with the chance to bring their creations to life in Infinity Heroes. Our in-game hero deck designer allows for artwork to be uploaded and applied to a player’s cards. From there, players will be able to name heroes, set their power levels and costs, give them effects, and upload their decks online to show off their creations.Like dinosaurs? Make 'em! Vampires? Sure, why not? Garlic spells? (is that a thing?). The point here is, the option is there to create ANYTHING...within reason. We've provided players with the freedom to become the heroes they want to be!ASSEMBLE YOUR HERO LINE-UPPlayers can pick three Heroes for their line-up.

But we will be unable to update the equipment, buy new batteries and confirm the event unless this IndieGoGo campaign is successful. <i><b>In other words, if we don't reach the goal here there will be no Phocon.</b></i> Please contribute now to make sure the event is a reality and a success. <br/><br/>Also, we will be limiting the number of Gamma Warrior (unlimited play) tickets to make sure that all Gamma Warriors get all the Photon they want during the weekend. Contributing now guarantees your spot.<br/><br/><i><b>Does my credit card (or paypal) get charged immediately or only if the campaign makes it?</b></i><br/><br/>According to Indiegogo, you will be charged immediately and your money will be refunded if we don't make our goal. We aren't about to let that happen, of course.<br/><br/><b><i>If I contribute less than $120 to keep the light shining and find out later I can actually attend the event, will I be able to?</i></b><br/><br/>Yes, we'll be selling tickets to the event afterwards (probably at $5-10 more than the perks here). If you donate to this campaign at any level, you will be able to upgrade (pay the difference) to get a ticket. If there are a lot of Photon Warriors, we may place a limit on the number of unlimited play perks to make sure you get your money's worth.<br/><br/><i><b>If I contribute with the $120 perk, will I be able to buy additional games on the party weekend?</b></i><br/><br/>Probably. It will depend on the number of unlimited players. If you can buy an extra individual game, it will probably be $5-6 per game. You will only be allowed to play if you purchase a perk here or later purchase or upgrade to an event ticket. In other words, you can't skip this campaign and show up to play one game...sorry. <br/><br/><i><b>Do I have to be on a team to play?</b></i><br/><br/>Absolutely not. This is not a tournament. While there may be some team ""grudge"" games, you'll be able to play games at all levels of skill and experience.<br/><br/><i><b>Will I be able to run when I play?</b></i><br/><br/>You'll get to play Photon like you always did, which means you must move in a safe and controlled manner. This means you can move quickly if you move in a safe and controlled manner.<br/><br/><i><b>Can I bring my son/daughter with me to play? What is the age requirement?</b></i><br/><br/>Yes, your whole family is invited to participate. Each perk is good for one person or you can wait to buy a ""ticket"" once the campaign succeeds. There is no age requirement, but we will have a height requirement of 48"" or taller for players due to the size and weight of the equipment.<br/></div>","Update: We Made It!

If there are a lot of Photon Warriors, we may place a limit on the number of unlimited play perks to make sure you get your money's worth.If I contribute with the $120 perk, will I be able to buy additional games on the party weekend?Probably. It will depend on the number of unlimited players. If you can buy an extra individual game, it will probably be $5-6 per game. You will only be allowed to play if you purchase a perk here or later purchase or upgrade to an event ticket. In other words, you can't skip this campaign and show up to play one game...sorry. Do I have to be on a team to play?Absolutely not. This is not a tournament. While there may be some team ""grudge"" games, you'll be able to play games at all levels of skill and experience.Will I be able to run when I play?You'll get to play Photon like you always did, which means you must move in a safe and controlled manner. This means you can move quickly if you move in a safe and controlled manner.Can I bring my son/daughter with me to play? What is the age requirement?Yes, your whole family is invited to participate. Each perk is good for one person or you can wait to buy a ""ticket"" once the campaign succeeds. There is no age requirement, but we will have a height requirement of 48"" or taller for players due to the size and weight of the equipment.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Needs</b><br/></p>
<p>Survivors as ""sim"" like
creatures. They need several different resources to survive in the world. Since
the world is pretty much over the survivors only care about the essentials,
food, security, socializing, and energy. Other needs such as medical care for
example gets tacked on when a survivor is sick. Just because the survivors have
these “needs” doesn’t mean you have to tend to them in a micromanaging way. You
don’t tell them to go eat, they just go eat when they get hungry provided there
is something available to eat. When they get tired they go to sleep at their
houses.</p>
<p>Since survivors have minds of
their own, they can sometimes ignore the commands issued by your leader. If
this happens, you can “shout” commands to force them to comply but this lowers
the respect the survivor has of the leader if abused. If respect gets too low
the survivor will pack their things and leave the camp so it’s important to
manage relations. A survivor will also leave if the food supply is empty for
too long, the camp gets overrun by zombies or armies from other camps, has a
huge fight with another camp member and many others.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Death</b></p>
<p>When a survivor goes hungry for
too long their health starts to take a hit. Eventually they will die if they do
not find food. Death is a big deal in this game. A map will only sprinkle in
immigrants at a desirable level if a camp reaches a certain level of fame. This
means that if too many people die then the population will be scarce until the
built-in immigration system repopulates the map which is a slow process and the
survivor could appear anywhere on the map. There are a few ways to die, hunger,
attacked by zombie/survivor, illness, and suicide. After dying, the survivor
becomes a zombie and roams about the world looking for fresh meat. </p>
<p>Other survivors in the camp are
affected deeply by death and it can lower the camps overall morale. Just
because the world is over doesn’t mean we have suddenly become savages.
Survivors in your camp can be hesitant to kill another human and often express
remorse when they do kill. Be careful of asking weaker constituted survivors to
do the “dirty” work as they may leave or take their own life.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Backgrounds</b></p>
<p>Survivors didn’t just appear out
of thin air when the apocalypse started, they were there when times were good
and they are here now when things have gone to s**t. You can get to know a
survivor by conversing with them through the dialogue system. The more you get
to know about them, the more favor you will have with them. A high favor will
ensure that survivor follows commands stricter than others and exhibits more
loyalty to the leader. In addition, the backstories of the survivors will be
extensive and widely variant due to a procedural generation system. The custom
story generator dissects the aspects of a background story and substitutes tags
from a large pool to create believable stories (and some not) that we can then
cull and ship with the game. I want this game to bring you to tears when a
survivor you have been with for a while is killed by a huge horde that was
approaching the campsite. Each play through will be unique as you watch the
different personalities battle it out in the camp and between the camps.</p>
<p>The previous jobs of survivors,
their personalities, talents and story quirks will contribute their skill
levels and possibly give them a specific class that will provide a camp with
new functionality.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Groups</b></p>
<p>The world is filled is with other
survivors that have what it takes to be called a <b>leader</b>. These other
leaders will do the same things that you do as a human player. They will
explore the world, build a camp, recruit other survivors and they may even
attack you if you encroach on their territory. While civilization may be dead,
the world is not and there is always so much going at any point in the game. As
the leader of a group you need to manage everything and deal with the responsibilities
of the job. If I get enough funding I will be adding in features like camp
government where a survivor can be appointed to handle a portion of your job.
You can allow for voting or you can appoint someone with both methods having
their pros and cons.</p>

<p><b>Shooting</b> – SURVIVAL RULE
#2. <b>A gun is man’s best friend in the zombie apocalypse.</b> What used to be
a hobby is a now a requirement for basic survival.  An unskilled shooter will miss often and can
only handle basic weapons. As the survivor makes kills their skill will
increase but they can also train at the shooting range. Be careful though,
shooting is loud and attracts zombies to the area so use it sparingly.</p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span><p></p>
<p><b>Speed</b> – SURVIVAL RULE #5. <b>I
don’t have to out run the zombies, I just have to out run you.</b> The faster
you are, the quicker you can get somewhere. This skill doesn’t really build and
is an inherent skill that will decrement if the survivor gets sick or injured.
Don’t worry, it can return to normal though once the survivor is healed (with a
minor penalty of course).</p>
<p><b>Stamina</b> – SURVIVAL RULE #1.
<b>If you run out of Stamina, your death clock starts ticking faster.</b> You
won’t be able to fight or run. You’re as a good as dead. The number displayed
is the max stamina the survivor can have. A higher Stamina skill means running
longer distances and dishing out more punches or bat swings. Stamina replenishes
with rest and sleep so be sure to let a tired survivor get some rest before
taking them out again.</p>
<p><b>Strength </b>– SURVIVAL RULE #3. <b>You
gotta know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em, other times you just gotta
kick some zombie ass. </b>A survivor’s strength is an indicator of how good at
fighting they are. It dictates how much damage they deal when they hit
something. Higher strength skill allows for larger more deadly weapons to be
used. A downside and upside of strength is that it is tied to stamina. Each
attack makes the survivor more tired often leading to them being unable to deal
another blow or even escape. The upside however is that melee training also
raises the stamina skill so they are usually able to complement each other.</p>
<p><b>Stealth</b> – SURVIVAL RULE #4.
<b>If you can stay hidden, you can stay alive. </b>The stealth skill controls
how loud a survivor is when moving around and looting containers. It also
affects the survivors contribution to the camps overall noise presence. Stealth
is built doing things in stealth stance or reading books at the camps library.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Stats</b></p>
<p><b>Happiness</b> – This stat is
calculated by the inventory of the survivors group, security of the group, and
whether any events have occurred in the recent past. These events include group
members dying or the bringing back of a large haul of resources.</p>
<p><b>Zombie Kills</b>
– Literally how many zombies the survivor has killed</p>
<p><b>Survivor Kills</b>
– The amount of survivors that have been murdered</p>
<p><b>Hunger</b> – How hungry the
survivor currently is. If it gets too low, the survivor will seek out food.</p>
<p><b>Health</b> – The amount of the
life the survivor has. If health dips too low the survivor will flee and seek
shelter. They will also try to get medical help either through a med kit or at
the medical station.</p>
<p><b>Honor</b> – How honorable your
actions are. If you do things like murder survivors, your honor will go down
but will go up if you deliver goods to another survivor camp. If your camps
collective honor is excessively low then you form a reputation that will cause unencountered
groups to have a negative bias towards you from before meeting you.</p>

<p>Slow, ugly, stupid creatures that
only want to eat you and will do anything to do it. I didn’t want special
zombies nor did I want zombies that can run because they are too stupid to run.
This makes the games dynamic interesting as a zombie or three is no real threat
but when they show up in hordes &gt;30, you will have a big problem because you
can easily get cornered if you aren’t in an open area. The risk is even higher
if you lead them back to your base, where they will kill sleeping survivors and
chase off other ones.<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>

<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Item Variety</b></p>
<p>The amount of items in the game is
planned to basically be limitless. I have designed the game to already have a
JSON script parser that transforms scripts that anyone can make it game items.
If you don’t like the images for the included guns, you can just swap out the
images and restart the game. If you don’t think the food in the game gives
enough hunger boost, you change the modifier values in the script and it will
change the game. You can also introduce new items to the game by using the
program I use to make the items. I will be releasing this tool with game and
basically it streamlines the process of making new game items. You can make a
new food types, medicines, weapons, luxury items, pretty much anything you
want.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Scavenging/Looting</b></p>
<p>There is no such thing as a free
lunch so you better get used to going out and searching for supplies. Around
there world are a few small towns with plenty of lootable buildings that can be
sacked with little to medium effort. Once these supply stores are all
exhausted, groups can venture into the main city in the center of the map.
While the loot is plenty, the danger is high and can lead to the loss of a
survivor or the whole scavenging party. This progression of resource exhaustion
and pushing towards the city slowly increases the games difficulty and results
in a natural end point where the map has nothing left to offer to keep a group
alive. At this point I will allow the group to be exported and you can then
start a new map with the same group from your previous map. It will be kind of
like moving to a new region.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Forestry/Hunting/Farming</b></p>
<p>The trees in the game aren’t there
to just look pretty. You can chop them down and use them to build your camp.
Sometimes you get lucky and find a pile of wood in the forest from a storm or
at the local hardware store. Animals like deer can be hunted and chickens and
hogs can be kept for food. Survivors can plant seeds they find and grow food
for the camp so you don’t have to constantly be sending out search parties.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/950075/files/20141022000253-Building.png?1413961373"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Camp</b></p>
<p>Your camp is your home and base of
operations. Without a camp your sphere of influence is low and you can’t issue
commands to far away survivors. Establishing a camp also allows for the
placement of other buildings such as houses, storage pallets, workshops and
medical bays.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Construction</b></p>
<p>Survivors will spend time building
each structure until it is completed. There will be a large variety of
buildings in the final game but the alpha will only have a select amount until
further development is completed.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">World</b></p>
<p>While you can of course build
inside the buildings of the world, I wouldn’t recommend it as it results in a
bottle neck if your survivors wish to escape from a zombie attack. Who am I to
tell you no and not let you do it so I implemented it as a feature. Eventually
the buildings that you would normally place outside will just be place inside
without their outer exterior which they won’t need inside.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/950078/files/20141022000349-Missions.png?1413961429"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Missions serve to build favor
between a leader and a prospective survivor recruit, two survivor camps or just
any two survivors. The intention is make the missions scriptable just like the
dialogue and item system already completed. With a scripted system it would
allow for players to make their own custom missions.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Starting Locations</b></p>
<p>There will be three starting
scenarios to choose from in the final build of the game. The first and hardest
is starting in the center of the city and having to escape before being able to
build a defendable camp. The medium setting would be being placed in one of the
maps towns and having to survive from that point and the easiest is being
placed in the woods away from much of the chaos.</p>

<div>My name is Fuad Mefleh and I'm a PhD graduate in Bioengineering out of Clemson University.  I have a background in C/C++ programming with applications in medical software development and embedded systems design.  So you are wondering, why does an engineer want to make a game?</div>
<div>One of my motivations for learning to program was to make video games that I would like to play in my downtime. While all of the games out there are fun and literally time black holes I felt there was something missing in a genre I found particularly interesting. I wanted to explore what its like to lead a group of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world. Games such as State of Decay have implemented this but the AI is severely lacking. I want to bring life to these dead worlds and present to you, the player,compelling and realistic back stories that influence the way the AI behaves.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I'm running this early campaign to collect funds for several reasons. They are as follows:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hire a 3D modeler to convert ideas and sketches to game entities. </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Either purchase or have sounds recorded for both survivors and zombies</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hire a graphic designer to create a new UI</span></li>

<div>Get the game at a huge discount through the early bird perks!  They are limited so get them while they last.  There are going to be PreAlpha demos on the games IndieDB page until the roll out of the official alpha in a little over a month.</div>
</div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I am a seasoned programmer with over 5 years experience and I have a doctorate in Bioengineering and developed an image-guided surgery framework from scratch. This project is something I have been waiting to do but had to wait on because of academics. Your donation to this project will help me get this idea to the alpha stage where I can hopefully release the game and it can provide funds for itself. I plan to use every cent raise on developing the game and getting the assets needed designed and created.</p>

<div>I feel that my skills are strong enough to tackle a challenge like developing<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">a video game.

</div>
<div>If I am not able to raise the necessary funds through this campaign to employ the required personnel I will have to pay from my own pocket. Ideally I would like this game to support itself and not serve as a means for me to make money. </div>

Needs
Survivors as ""sim"" like
creatures. They need several different resources to survive in the world. Since
the world is pretty much over the survivors only care about the essentials,
food, security, socializing, and energy. Other needs such as medical care for
example gets tacked on when a survivor is sick. Just because the survivors have
these “needs” doesn’t mean you have to tend to them in a micromanaging way. You
don’t tell them to go eat, they just go eat when they get hungry provided there
is something available to eat. When they get tired they go to sleep at their
houses.
Since survivors have minds of
their own, they can sometimes ignore the commands issued by your leader. If
this happens, you can “shout” commands to force them to comply but this lowers
the respect the survivor has of the leader if abused. If respect gets too low
the survivor will pack their things and leave the camp so it’s important to
manage relations. A survivor will also leave if the food supply is empty for
too long, the camp gets overrun by zombies or armies from other camps, has a
huge fight with another camp member and many others.
Death
When a survivor goes hungry for
too long their health starts to take a hit. Eventually they will die if they do
not find food. Death is a big deal in this game. A map will only sprinkle in
immigrants at a desirable level if a camp reaches a certain level of fame. This
means that if too many people die then the population will be scarce until the
built-in immigration system repopulates the map which is a slow process and the
survivor could appear anywhere on the map. There are a few ways to die, hunger,
attacked by zombie/survivor, illness, and suicide. After dying, the survivor
becomes a zombie and roams about the world looking for fresh meat. 
Other survivors in the camp are
affected deeply by death and it can lower the camps overall morale. Just
because the world is over doesn’t mean we have suddenly become savages.
Survivors in your camp can be hesitant to kill another human and often express
remorse when they do kill. Be careful of asking weaker constituted survivors to
do the “dirty” work as they may leave or take their own life.
Backgrounds
Survivors didn’t just appear out
of thin air when the apocalypse started, they were there when times were good
and they are here now when things have gone to s**t. You can get to know a
survivor by conversing with them through the dialogue system. The more you get
to know about them, the more favor you will have with them. A high favor will
ensure that survivor follows commands stricter than others and exhibits more
loyalty to the leader. In addition, the backstories of the survivors will be
extensive and widely variant due to a procedural generation system. The custom
story generator dissects the aspects of a background story and substitutes tags
from a large pool to create believable stories (and some not) that we can then
cull and ship with the game. I want this game to bring you to tears when a
survivor you have been with for a while is killed by a huge horde that was
approaching the campsite. Each play through will be unique as you watch the
different personalities battle it out in the camp and between the camps.
The previous jobs of survivors,
their personalities, talents and story quirks will contribute their skill
levels and possibly give them a specific class that will provide a camp with
new functionality.
Groups
The world is filled is with other
survivors that have what it takes to be called a leader. These other
leaders will do the same things that you do as a human player. They will
explore the world, build a camp, recruit other survivors and they may even
attack you if you encroach on their territory. While civilization may be dead,
the world is not and there is always so much going at any point in the game. As
the leader of a group you need to manage everything and deal with the responsibilities
of the job. If I get enough funding I will be adding in features like camp
government where a survivor can be appointed to handle a portion of your job.
You can allow for voting or you can appoint someone with both methods having
their pros and cons.
Skills



Shooting – SURVIVAL RULE
#2. A gun is man’s best friend in the zombie apocalypse. What used to be
a hobby is a now a requirement for basic survival.  An unskilled shooter will miss often and can
only handle basic weapons. As the survivor makes kills their skill will
increase but they can also train at the shooting range. Be careful though,
shooting is loud and attracts zombies to the area so use it sparingly.

Speed – SURVIVAL RULE #5. I
don’t have to out run the zombies, I just have to out run you. The faster
you are, the quicker you can get somewhere. This skill doesn’t really build and
is an inherent skill that will decrement if the survivor gets sick or injured.
Don’t worry, it can return to normal though once the survivor is healed (with a
minor penalty of course).
Stamina – SURVIVAL RULE #1.
If you run out of Stamina, your death clock starts ticking faster. You
won’t be able to fight or run. You’re as a good as dead. The number displayed
is the max stamina the survivor can have. A higher Stamina skill means running
longer distances and dishing out more punches or bat swings. Stamina replenishes
with rest and sleep so be sure to let a tired survivor get some rest before
taking them out again.
Strength – SURVIVAL RULE #3. You
gotta know when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em, other times you just gotta
kick some zombie ass. A survivor’s strength is an indicator of how good at
fighting they are. It dictates how much damage they deal when they hit
something. Higher strength skill allows for larger more deadly weapons to be
used. A downside and upside of strength is that it is tied to stamina. Each
attack makes the survivor more tired often leading to them being unable to deal
another blow or even escape. The upside however is that melee training also
raises the stamina skill so they are usually able to complement each other.
Stealth – SURVIVAL RULE #4.
If you can stay hidden, you can stay alive. The stealth skill controls
how loud a survivor is when moving around and looting containers. It also
affects the survivors contribution to the camps overall noise presence. Stealth
is built doing things in stealth stance or reading books at the camps library.
Stats
Happiness – This stat is
calculated by the inventory of the survivors group, security of the group, and
whether any events have occurred in the recent past. These events include group
members dying or the bringing back of a large haul of resources.
Zombie Kills
– Literally how many zombies the survivor has killed
Survivor Kills
– The amount of survivors that have been murdered
Hunger – How hungry the
survivor currently is. If it gets too low, the survivor will seek out food.
Health – The amount of the
life the survivor has. If health dips too low the survivor will flee and seek
shelter. They will also try to get medical help either through a med kit or at
the medical station.
Honor – How honorable your
actions are. If you do things like murder survivors, your honor will go down
but will go up if you deliver goods to another survivor camp. If your camps
collective honor is excessively low then you form a reputation that will cause unencountered
groups to have a negative bias towards you from before meeting you.



Slow, ugly, stupid creatures that
only want to eat you and will do anything to do it. I didn’t want special
zombies nor did I want zombies that can run because they are too stupid to run.
This makes the games dynamic interesting as a zombie or three is no real threat
but when they show up in hordes >30, you will have a big problem because you
can easily get cornered if you aren’t in an open area. The risk is even higher
if you lead them back to your base, where they will kill sleeping survivors and
chase off other ones.


Item Variety
The amount of items in the game is
planned to basically be limitless. I have designed the game to already have a
JSON script parser that transforms scripts that anyone can make it game items.
If you don’t like the images for the included guns, you can just swap out the
images and restart the game. If you don’t think the food in the game gives
enough hunger boost, you change the modifier values in the script and it will
change the game. You can also introduce new items to the game by using the
program I use to make the items. I will be releasing this tool with game and
basically it streamlines the process of making new game items. You can make a
new food types, medicines, weapons, luxury items, pretty much anything you
want.


Scavenging/Looting
There is no such thing as a free
lunch so you better get used to going out and searching for supplies. Around
there world are a few small towns with plenty of lootable buildings that can be
sacked with little to medium effort. Once these supply stores are all
exhausted, groups can venture into the main city in the center of the map.
While the loot is plenty, the danger is high and can lead to the loss of a
survivor or the whole scavenging party. This progression of resource exhaustion
and pushing towards the city slowly increases the games difficulty and results
in a natural end point where the map has nothing left to offer to keep a group
alive. At this point I will allow the group to be exported and you can then
start a new map with the same group from your previous map. It will be kind of
like moving to a new region.
Forestry/Hunting/Farming
The trees in the game aren’t there
to just look pretty. You can chop them down and use them to build your camp.
Sometimes you get lucky and find a pile of wood in the forest from a storm or
at the local hardware store. Animals like deer can be hunted and chickens and
hogs can be kept for food. Survivors can plant seeds they find and grow food
for the camp so you don’t have to constantly be sending out search parties.


Camp
Your camp is your home and base of
operations. Without a camp your sphere of influence is low and you can’t issue
commands to far away survivors. Establishing a camp also allows for the
placement of other buildings such as houses, storage pallets, workshops and
medical bays.
Construction
Survivors will spend time building
each structure until it is completed. There will be a large variety of
buildings in the final game but the alpha will only have a select amount until
further development is completed.
The World
While you can of course build
inside the buildings of the world, I wouldn’t recommend it as it results in a
bottle neck if your survivors wish to escape from a zombie attack. Who am I to
tell you no and not let you do it so I implemented it as a feature. Eventually
the buildings that you would normally place outside will just be place inside
without their outer exterior which they won’t need inside.


Missions serve to build favor
between a leader and a prospective survivor recruit, two survivor camps or just
any two survivors. The intention is make the missions scriptable just like the
dialogue and item system already completed. With a scripted system it would
allow for players to make their own custom missions.


Starting Locations
There will be three starting
scenarios to choose from in the final build of the game. The first and hardest
is starting in the center of the city and having to escape before being able to
build a defendable camp. The medium setting would be being placed in one of the
maps towns and having to survive from that point and the easiest is being
placed in the woods away from much of the chaos.

I'm running this early campaign to collect funds for several reasons. They are as follows:


Hire a 3D modeler to convert ideas and sketches to game entities. 
Either purchase or have sounds recorded for both survivors and zombies
Hire a graphic designer to create a new UI

Get the game at a huge discount through the early bird perks!  They are limited so get them while they last.  There are going to be PreAlpha demos on the games IndieDB page until the roll out of the official alpha in a little over a month.


  The Impact I am a seasoned programmer with over 5 years experience and I have a doctorate in Bioengineering and developed an image-guided surgery framework from scratch. This project is something I have been waiting to do but had to wait on because of academics. Your donation to this project will help me get this idea to the alpha stage where I can hopefully release the game and it can provide funds for itself. I plan to use every cent raise on developing the game and getting the assets needed designed and created.

  Risks & Challenges
I feel that my skills are strong enough to tackle a challenge like developinga video game. While I know I can do a lot of things, I am choosing not to bite off too much. I chose to make the game single player because it adds unneeded complexity. I want this game to be rich enough without multiplayer and I believe it will be.

If I am not able to raise the necessary funds through this campaign to employ the required personnel I will have to pay from my own pocket. Ideally I would like this game to support itself and not serve as a means for me to make money. 

  Other Ways You Can Help Get the word out about this game if you like it.  Tell your mom, dad, brother, sister, girlfriend, boyfriend... you get the point.  The more people that know the more chances I'll have at someone donating.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>“Ghost Encounters: Deadwood - The Collector’s Edition” is an exciting, casual adventure game where you play the role of an extraordinary paranormal detective who has an uncanny ability to see beyond the normal world and communicate with lost souls. You will travel to the ghost town of Deadwood where the spirit of the infamous outlaw Blackjack has been unleashed and he is killing off the townsfolk. Your paranormal talents will be required to communicate with his past victims and uncover the mysteries of Deadwood before more innocent lives are lost.</p>

<p><br/>“Ghost Encounters: Deadwood” was originally released for the PC. Since then we have decided to remaster the game with an entirely new game engine allowing for faster performance, more special effects, and the ability to make mobile versions. But this is not a typical port to new platforms. We have gone back and reworked numerous areas of the game to make it an even better gameplay experience. We are adding:</p>
<ul>
<li>New game content and puzzles</li>
<li>Improved cinematics and special effects</li>
<li>Additional story elements</li>
<li>Introducing a new main character</li>
<li>Recording voice overs throughout</li>

<p>“Ghost Encounters: Deadwood” is a casual adventure game that includes over a dozen types of minigames and puzzles, including some hidden object games. The core gameplay mechanic of this new “Collector’s Edition” of the game is adventuring. We love old school adventure games, but casual adventure games are also a lot of fun and open the adventuring genre up to a wider audience. So rest assured that there is plenty adventuring to be had in the town of Deadwood!</p>

<p>The good news is we do not require additional funds to complete this game, but have brought this project to you to help it succeed once complete. We are a very small indie developer who has mostly relied on publishers through the years to promote our games. Recently we have begun to branch out and start to distribute some of our games directly to the players. As you are probably aware, this is not an easy task. Finding an audience for our games is always the biggest challenge. We don’t have a marketing team, let alone a marketing budget. So we thought crowd funding would be a great way to work directly with players and help us get the word out about “Ghost Encounters: Deadwood” and Anarchy Enterprises.</p>
<p>In addition, there are some things that can be done via crowd funding that frankly would be hard to replicate through most other distribution models. The ability to bring the players into the development fold as well as the type of rewards we can offer makes for a unique development experience.</p>

<p>First off thank you for taking the time to check out our crowd funding project. Anarchy Enterprises has been developing independent games for over a dozen years. Our first retail game Moon Tycoon came out way back in 2001, but we have not yet crowd-sourced a project. We are extremely excited to be able to work more closely with you – the people who actually play our games!</p>
<p>Sometimes game development feels like working behind closed doors. When working with a publisher, us developers can get isolated from the people that are most important to the game development process – the players. Game developers tend to have to deal with publishers, distributors, hardware techs, lawyers, corporate middlemen and a myriad of others that will never end up playing and enjoying the games that are being created. Anarchy Enterprises has always been a small, indie studio that would like to stay directly connected with game players, and now we have a tremendous opportunity via crowd funding to make that relationship even closer</p>

<p><img alt=""Hey"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83403397/Intro.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Intro""/></p>
<p>I am Chris Laurent. What can I say; I love gaming, technology and live for creativity.</p>
<p>My friends and I are creating a game inspired by Anti Bullying. The first ever Rikishi influenced JRPG to focus on the Art of Sumo and mixed combat. The story is set in imaginary old japan and is based on a chubby boy and a journey in self-discovery.<br/></p>
<p>This unique JRPG cleverly and unobtrusively infuses Anti-Bullying into a compelling story line. Sumoboy's interesting and unexpected emotional behavior through out game play demonstrates this powerful message.<br/></p>
<p>Below you will find information on this independent game project, and how you can help if you want to help us bring it to life.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Now let me ask you? Have you ever had an idea for a game, but never able to get it out into the world? Well, like many, I have. I’ve had mine since I was 7. </p>
<p>The idea was sparked by a playground encounter back in Grade 2, and ever since, I've been plotting revenge in the form of creative arcade action animation!</p>
<p><img alt=""fight"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/83403397/fight.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sumoboy jump jab ""/></p>
<p>The year is 1985, and I am being pushed around in front of my classroom. These pushes quickly turn to punches and kicks, and I find myself knocked down to the pavement.</p>
<p>As a 7-year-old, my first thought was 'Darn, I wish I knew Kung Fu'</p>
<p>I am sure most would agree. At some point in every kid’s life, we've all wanted the strength and ability of a skilled warrior such as a Kung Fu master for one reason or another. </p>
<p>A couple of years later, I sketched my first drawing of an unnamed character and with that, it began a life-long dream to create an underdog fighting game experience. </p>
<p>Fast forward to today, it all started with the recreation of the original drawing of the character I did all those years ago. When I finished sketching, I realised he looked more like a Sumo boy.</p>
<p>Finally after eight years in digital, we can turn this ambitious kid’s story into an epic adventure!</p>

<p></p>
<p>SumoBoy has no one and nothing; he’s a
chubby orphan who is almost constantly picked on, put down and over-looked. He
has no real home or identity. He has no idea who his parents are or where he
comes from. </p>
<p>What’s an unfortunate child like this to
do? Why, just make it all up, of course!</p>
<p>While SumoBoy’s real/external life is dull,
drab and somewhat meaningless, his interior life, the life he lives in his
mind, is rich and adventurous. It is this internal life that keeps him sane and
in a (relatively) good humor. Most children born into these ill-fated circumstances
would be bitter, unruly miscreants, but not SumoBoy. He remains polite and
studious because, ultimately, he believes that what he has made up in his head
is <b>real</b> and if he isn’t a good boy,
his mother won’t come to claim him one day; to remove him from the awful <i>Tohoku Home for Boys</i> where he is bullied
and beaten on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Of course, the “origin” that SumoBoy has
concocted for himself is rather epic. His parents aren’t just “Joe the Truck
Driver” and “Linda the Waitress” who live in a small apartment in the city and
have normal, everyday problems. In SumoBoy’s mind, his father is a famous Sumo
wrestler known as “<i>Otokoyama</i>  (男山)” or “The Man Mountain” and his mother, Kesa, is truly “<i>Yoso no Ojo</i> (要素の王女)<i>The Princess of the
Elements</i>” disguised in human form here on Earth. Her
father was chosen to be her protector/bodyguard because of his physical, wrestling
prowess and enormous girth. And, as these things go (or as SumoBoy willed them
to go because it’s his fantasy after all), Yama and Kesa fell in love and had a
child, <i>Oji </i>(SumoBoy’s true name).</p>
<p>Now, why would The Princess of the Elements
be hiding out in the real world and need a protector? Good questions. The
answers are simple: the comely Princess had another suitor of course, a guileful
being known as <i>Kurai Kami</i>. The
Princess spurned Kuari Kami’s advances because she sensed that he was a truly
malignant and repulsive creature. Kurai Kami is not one to be rebuffed, so he
pursued her throughout time and to the very ends of existence…until she had no
choice but to disguise herself as a simple human being, hide amongst them and
hope that Kurai Kami would forget her.</p>
<p>Kuari Kami is also one not to
forget…especially someone who has escaped his nefarious grasp. It took some
doing, but Kurai Kami eventually found the Princess, hiding in plain sight on
Earth. A plan was hatched: Kurai Kami would possess Yama’s main Sumo rival, <i>D. Toyota</i>, granting him extraordinary
powers for their bout. He would “accidentally” slay Yama in the ring and then
make off with the near defenseless Princess. Unfortunately for the infant
SumoBoy/Oji this vile plot worked to perfection and left him an orphan.</p>
<p>Now that he is older and able to fight,
SumoBoy has been receiving mental/dream messages from his mother, the captive
Princess. He must find the courage within him; he must channel the fighting
spirit of his father and release her from under Kurai Kami’s evil thumb.  SumoBoy must release the Four Elements of the
Earth (wind, water, fire and earth) from the control of Kurai Kami to fully
restore his mother’s power and then they can face Kurai Kami together.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is still within Kesa’s
power to send her son two “gifts” to aid him in the coming battle with Kurai
Kami: the wizened old Master, <i>Kodai</i>,
and the <i>Ainohane to Nikushimi</i> (愛の羽根と憎しみ), <i>The Blade of Love and Hate</i>. In reality
Kodai is just the janitor at the orphanage, but SumoBoy has co-opted him into
his fantasy because Kodai is nice to him.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>We have been working hard on Sumoboy for 12 months. From sketches to renders and framing to animation takes hundreds of hours. The 2D animation is finally complete and we are frenetically working on the 3D assets. We plan to begin iOS development first off, before moving towards Android, PC, Mac and Linux.<br/></p>
<p>We've happily invested a lot of time and money into this project, and we are extremely proud of what we've been able to achieve thus far, but unfortunately, this progress comes at a cost, but hey we are passionate and driven. We've come this far so why not do everything humanly possible to raise the additional funds needed to make Sumoboy’s epic story come to life.<br/></p>
<p>To launch Sumoboy successfully, we need to be able to pay the associated bills. Coding animation and multiple platform development is an expensive and massive effort, which we want to make sure is done right. To do that, we are looking for help from backers. </p>
<p><strong>That's where you come in</strong>. With your help, together we can break through walls and push Sumoboy over the line. Support will get the first game live on iPhone, iPad and Android well before the end of the year as we push towards PC and Mac and Linux with our stretch goals.</p>
<p><strong>Be part of Sumoboy history, help us reach our goal and turn this small unheard of indie game into a household name.</strong></p>
<p>We love games that take us to far away places, however just like you. We live in the real world and don't expect something for nothing, so we have lined up heaps of awesome original memorabilia to reward you for your kind donations.

<p>To be honest, there is a ton of work that goes into an ambitious vision such as a game –  a lot more than we initially thought. Fortunately, we have extensive knowledge in application development and the skills in gaming and mobile to turn this creative project into a finished reality. </p>

Pervious Episodes: Click here to read 


A downtrodden young hero must rise,
conquering his own fears and doubts to take up a magical sword, rescue a
Princess and vanquish the malevolent forces that oppose him.
That sounds like the basic plot to scores
of popular films, books, comics and video games, doesn’t it? Well, THE LEGEND
OF SUMOBOY is that and yet it will be so much more. We at Taprr intend to
re-invent what one would expect in a traditional JRPG by taking a cue from modern day poetry, comics and video games in terms of story and gameplay. We don’t want to
be tied to a stringent, retro and/or homage sensibility – we want to transcend
sensibility to make something truly cool and original!

I am Chris Laurent. What can I say; I love gaming, technology and live for creativity.
My friends and I are creating a game inspired by Anti Bullying. The first ever Rikishi influenced JRPG to focus on the Art of Sumo and mixed combat. The story is set in imaginary old japan and is based on a chubby boy and a journey in self-discovery.
This unique JRPG cleverly and unobtrusively infuses Anti-Bullying into a compelling story line. Sumoboy's interesting and unexpected emotional behavior through out game play demonstrates this powerful message.
Below you will find information on this independent game project, and how you can help if you want to help us bring it to life.





 
Now let me ask you? Have you ever had an idea for a game, but never able to get it out into the world? Well, like many, I have. I’ve had mine since I was 7. 
The idea was sparked by a playground encounter back in Grade 2, and ever since, I've been plotting revenge in the form of creative arcade action animation!

The year is 1985, and I am being pushed around in front of my classroom. These pushes quickly turn to punches and kicks, and I find myself knocked down to the pavement.
As a 7-year-old, my first thought was 'Darn, I wish I knew Kung Fu'
I am sure most would agree. At some point in every kid’s life, we've all wanted the strength and ability of a skilled warrior such as a Kung Fu master for one reason or another. 
A couple of years later, I sketched my first drawing of an unnamed character and with that, it began a life-long dream to create an underdog fighting game experience. 
Fast forward to today, it all started with the recreation of the original drawing of the character I did all those years ago. When I finished sketching, I realised he looked more like a Sumo boy.
Finally after eight years in digital, we can turn this ambitious kid’s story into an epic adventure!













SumoBoy has no one and nothing; he’s a
chubby orphan who is almost constantly picked on, put down and over-looked. He
has no real home or identity. He has no idea who his parents are or where he
comes from. 
What’s an unfortunate child like this to
do? Why, just make it all up, of course!
While SumoBoy’s real/external life is dull,
drab and somewhat meaningless, his interior life, the life he lives in his
mind, is rich and adventurous. It is this internal life that keeps him sane and
in a (relatively) good humor. Most children born into these ill-fated circumstances
would be bitter, unruly miscreants, but not SumoBoy. He remains polite and
studious because, ultimately, he believes that what he has made up in his head
is real and if he isn’t a good boy,
his mother won’t come to claim him one day; to remove him from the awful Tohoku Home for Boys where he is bullied
and beaten on a daily basis.
Of course, the “origin” that SumoBoy has
concocted for himself is rather epic. His parents aren’t just “Joe the Truck
Driver” and “Linda the Waitress” who live in a small apartment in the city and
have normal, everyday problems. In SumoBoy’s mind, his father is a famous Sumo
wrestler known as “Otokoyama  (男山)” or “The Man Mountain” and his mother, Kesa, is truly “Yoso no Ojo (要素の王女)The Princess of the
Elements” disguised in human form here on Earth. Her
father was chosen to be her protector/bodyguard because of his physical, wrestling
prowess and enormous girth. And, as these things go (or as SumoBoy willed them
to go because it’s his fantasy after all), Yama and Kesa fell in love and had a
child, Oji (SumoBoy’s true name).
Now, why would The Princess of the Elements
be hiding out in the real world and need a protector? Good questions. The
answers are simple: the comely Princess had another suitor of course, a guileful
being known as Kurai Kami. The
Princess spurned Kuari Kami’s advances because she sensed that he was a truly
malignant and repulsive creature. Kurai Kami is not one to be rebuffed, so he
pursued her throughout time and to the very ends of existence…until she had no
choice but to disguise herself as a simple human being, hide amongst them and
hope that Kurai Kami would forget her.
Kuari Kami is also one not to
forget…especially someone who has escaped his nefarious grasp. It took some
doing, but Kurai Kami eventually found the Princess, hiding in plain sight on
Earth. A plan was hatched: Kurai Kami would possess Yama’s main Sumo rival, D. Toyota, granting him extraordinary
powers for their bout. He would “accidentally” slay Yama in the ring and then
make off with the near defenseless Princess. Unfortunately for the infant
SumoBoy/Oji this vile plot worked to perfection and left him an orphan.
Now that he is older and able to fight,
SumoBoy has been receiving mental/dream messages from his mother, the captive
Princess. He must find the courage within him; he must channel the fighting
spirit of his father and release her from under Kurai Kami’s evil thumb.  SumoBoy must release the Four Elements of the
Earth (wind, water, fire and earth) from the control of Kurai Kami to fully
restore his mother’s power and then they can face Kurai Kami together.
Fortunately, it is still within Kesa’s
power to send her son two “gifts” to aid him in the coming battle with Kurai
Kami: the wizened old Master, Kodai,
and the Ainohane to Nikushimi (愛の羽根と憎しみ), The Blade of Love and Hate. In reality
Kodai is just the janitor at the orphanage, but SumoBoy has co-opted him into
his fantasy because Kodai is nice to him.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT! TO BE CONTINUED... Keep your eye's on our comic updates to see what happens next! Mondays, Wednesday & Saturdays here EXCLUSIVE on Indiegogo.

Produced by Taprr, a small passionate independent app and now, game studio. We promise to capitulate the true essence of youthful courage -- the kind that lives deep within the sole of every person that has ever been made to feel less than good enough.





We have been working hard on Sumoboy for 12 months. From sketches to renders and framing to animation takes hundreds of hours. The 2D animation is finally complete and we are frenetically working on the 3D assets. We plan to begin iOS development first off, before moving towards Android, PC, Mac and Linux.
We've happily invested a lot of time and money into this project, and we are extremely proud of what we've been able to achieve thus far, but unfortunately, this progress comes at a cost, but hey we are passionate and driven. We've come this far so why not do everything humanly possible to raise the additional funds needed to make Sumoboy’s epic story come to life.
To launch Sumoboy successfully, we need to be able to pay the associated bills. Coding animation and multiple platform development is an expensive and massive effort, which we want to make sure is done right. To do that, we are looking for help from backers. 
That's where you come in. With your help, together we can break through walls and push Sumoboy over the line. Support will get the first game live on iPhone, iPad and Android well before the end of the year as we push towards PC and Mac and Linux with our stretch goals.
Be part of Sumoboy history, help us reach our goal and turn this small unheard of indie game into a household name.
We love games that take us to far away places, however just like you. We live in the real world and don't expect something for nothing, so we have lined up heaps of awesome original memorabilia to reward you for your kind donations. You can check out what’s on offer down the right hand side of this page.
Go on make a donation now, we know you want to. :)







To be honest, there is a ton of work that goes into an ambitious vision such as a game –  a lot more than we initially thought. Fortunately, we have extensive knowledge in application development and the skills in gaming and mobile to turn this creative project into a finished reality. 
Here's a glimpse of what funding will go towards:
Game Design, User Experience, Animation, Game Programming/Coding, Story Production, Illustrated 2D and 3D Rendering/Rigging, Level Design, Production Management, Element Wire Framing, Sound Effects, Voice Artist, System Architecture, Systems Administration, De-bugging, QA and well, a lot more.
Funding from this Indiegogo campaign is none-profit and will go directly towards fuelling the bills related to the above production components.







I can tell you, we would be over the moon just to reach our target goal. However if we raise more, here are the awesome stretch goals to look forward to! 

 
 
 
SECOND GAME 3D - JRPG: This will move us away from just a PC demo game as we begin developing all levels with in Sumoboy's realm.  It allows us to enhance the game play experience through the implementation of more VFX and generate bigger battle options. 


 

SECOND GAME 3D - JRPG: This stretch goal will give us the wings to launch the second instalment in planing on playable on PC. Game play styling inspired by cult hits like Diablo III and Bastion.








 
Now we are talking. Firstly PC, MAC AND LINUX! All possibly via Steam so you can play Sumoboy on the major 3. Take Sumoboy through an epic comic inspired mystified 3D adventure to save the elements of earth.
We want you to play an active role in the development of this cult master piece.





 
Really?! Did someone say... more game play options? Battle Mode and Exploration Mode! Exploration allows you to execute mini quests to progress through story based objectives.
250K+ Plus: We have our eyes set on other platforms such as, Nintendo Wii U, Xbox Live Arcade/Indie/One, Play Station 3,4,Vita and even those new guys, OUYA and Gampop. You tell us what you want!
Note: We will add extended detail to these stretch goals as we get closer to each bench mark.

THE FIRST EVER SUMO BASED JRPG!

<h3>A brief background...</h3>
<p>I am Sergio, an indie developer from El Salvador. Last December I made ""Enola"" (approximate pronuntiation ""nwola"") a small game for the 48 hour ludum dare game development competition, and I'd love to take the game to a new level, and deliver a full interactive experience. The 48 hour game that I made is mostly an exploration game, but for the full version of Enola I want to make what I'd define as ""horror/adventure,"" as it will combine puzzles and unnerving situations in a twisted world.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>You're a nameless solitary character (maybe a person?), completely lost and with no previous knowledge of anything, and you have to figure out where you are and what to do based on the clues and pieces of information you get. Enola takes place in this weird twisted world, and there's a reason for this other than being a ""visual style."" Maybe this place is an alien planet, another dimension, or a dream. You don't know for sure, but you have to find out. Everything in Enola's story and setting is open to the players' interpretation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of my inspirations for this game are Myst, Silent Hill, The Blair Witch Project, Red Dragon, and Marble Hornets on Youtube. Visually, I was greatly inspired by the video game Limbo. By looking at these sources of inspiration, you can probably guess the kind of game I want Enola to be.</p>

<h3>What I Need...</h3>
<p>Since I'm not this talented person that can take on all aspects of making a game by himself, I'm asking for your support because I'll need the help from others to make a game into a really cool experience. This would include designers, artists, and (I hope) audio specialists as well, so you can experience Enola not just with your eyes but with your ears as well. As you can see, I need enough backing so I can turn Enola into a full game that everyone can play and enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The money would also be used to acquire a Mac (used or new, doesn't matter), and iDevices to test and port Enola to iOS, since the simple look-and-point control scheme would fit touch screens perfectly, and also to get a spot in different gaming events, like PAX, GDC, and such, so I'll be able to show the game to as many people as possible, live.</p>

Similar to “Capture the Flag” game TownEscape offers fun and unique gaming experience where ""TownEscapers"" (You!) tend to compete outdoors with each other to win real tangible products. A local town serves as a virtual playground, where all users' location and movements are identified via GPS signal emitted from their mobile devices. The game will be available on iOS, Android, Windows and Blackberry operating systems. On all of these marketplaces this mobile application will be free of charge. After downloading TownEscape on your mobile device, you will be able to use full version of our game!</p>
<h1><strong>Step By Step Guide - How It Works?</strong></h1>
<p>The purpose of this game is to create fun and unique experience for users, while spending time outdoors with your friends and other people. The most important part is that by competing with others, users are able to win real prizes and products. Your dream is much closer than you think! For example, you can win a car (or any other product) of your dreams just by having fun and competing with others players. Everything now is in your hands!</p>
<p><strong><em>Step 1 - Download TownEscape on your mobile device</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><img alt=""Splash Screen"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://townescape.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IG1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></strong></p>
<p>TownEscape will organize most competitions itself. TownEscapers first download the mobile application and when they access it they will see a list of location-based competitions available. Based on TownEscaper’s location, user will be presented with a list of existing or up-coming competitions held in his/her city or the closest city where competitions are being held, for example New York. The list will include different competitions and each of them will have a category, name, short description, number of entrants, final prize and the entrance fee.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""Prizes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://townescape.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IG2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>By pressing on one of the competitions, TownEscaper will be directed to a full description about this particular competition. In order to take part in one of the competitions user will have to pay an entrance fee (usually small one) or there would be also free competitions. Moreover, the user will be allowed to take part only in one active competition at a time.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""Prize description"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://townescape.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IG3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong><em>Step 2 - Entering Competition</em></strong></p>
<p>This is where all the fun part starts! After TownEscaper paid the entrance fee he/she will directly receive a map, where his/her current location will be shown (red), the location of the virtual prize (blue) and location of other users (green) participating in this particular game (competition). </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""Map big"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://townescape.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/IG4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The time in a header shows duration of the competition and when it will finish. Apart from the main menu, when user entered a particular competition, he/she will be presented with a new button called Tools. When TownEscapers will press on Tools tab, they will see a list of available in-game tools they can utilize in this particular competition or if they don’t have any tools purchased before - they will be offered to buy them. At the launch of the game, we will introduce the following in-app purchases (in-game tools):</p>
<p>• <em>Deactivation</em> – Deactivates your opponent for 5 minutes and deactivates him/her from re-catching a product from you.</p>
<p>• <em>Mass Deactivation</em> - Deactivates all your opponents within 100m (328 feet) radius for 5 minutes and deactivates them from re-catching a product from you.</p>
<p>• <em>Invisibility</em> – Makes you invisible for other TownEscapers for 5 minutes. Can’t use this tool when time left (duration) is less than 1 hour for a particular competition.</p>
<p>• <em>Mines</em> – Drops the prize from your opponent’s mobile device and he/she will be unable to pick it up for 2 minutes. You can put mines wherever you want to within a certain area specified for a certain competition.</p>
<p>• <em>Clones</em> – Creates two clones of you that will confuse your opponents.</p>
<p>• <em>Blind</em> – Makes your opponent “blind” by switching off his map for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>• <em>Shield</em> – You ignore all the tools used against you by your opponents for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>When time for competition will elapse, a lucky TownEscaper who will have a virtual prize on his/her mobile device at that moment will win the real physical prize! And this will be one of you!</p>
<h1><strong>TownEscape Leveling System</strong></h1>
<p>Based on TownEscaper’s experience or achievements, he/she will be able to acquire TownEscape levels. There will be 10 different levels. Each level will enable users to select their own Game Logo or icons, which will allow other users to see it on their maps and smartphones. When reaching a new level TownEscaper will be presented with items which he can buy from our shop, available only for users who reached a certain TownEscape level. Moreover, each level will have a certain privileges. In order to acquire a certain level a user has to earn points or experience by participating in different contests.</p>
<h1><strong>TownEscape Shop</strong></h1>
<p>At our shop you will be able to get some products for free and others for an additional fee. At each level which you will reach you will be presented with new and cool products that will be available for those users who reached a certain TownEscape level. Moreover, you will be able to exchange your virtual points on products at our store!</p>
<h1><strong>Team Play</strong></h1>
<p>The ability to create a team in TownEscape will be available as soon as the person will reach 10th level in TownEscape. The team owner (team leader) will be able to sign in those escapers who have reached 5th level. Being part of the team allows you to enter different team competitions and to aid your teammates in various competitions. Moreover, there will be a team rank and those teams who will reach top 3 in the end of the year will be awarded with unique prizes. Apart from this, our shop will offer rare products for TownEscape teams available only to them.</p>
<h1><strong>Game Restrictions</strong></h1>
<p>In order to make this game fair for everyone, we had to come up with the following boundaries for TownEscape:</p>
<p>• If TownEscaper turned off the device, lost 3G connection or lost a GPS signal he will be allowed to recover within 2 minutes. Otherwise he will loose the prize at his last location and won’t be allowed to pick it up for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>• TownEscapers have to be located within a pre-defined area for a certain competition, while they are competing. If the user went outside these boundaries, he/she will need to return back into this area within 5 minutes or his/her prize will be lost (at his last location when he was inside this area) and he won’t be allowed to pick it up for 1 hour.</p>
<p>• If there will be a suspicion about particular user’s actions, we will track the user and disqualify him if he broke the rules without any notice.</p>
<p>If that user broke the rule and had a virtual prize on his/her mobile device, then the virtual prize will be dropped at his last location and will be discarded from this particular competition.</p>
<p>While we will be developing TownEscape there might more game restrictions to come in order to make the game fair for every user. We will keep you updated!</p>

<p>Please follow us on our <a href=""http://www.townescape.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Website</a>, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TownEscape"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/TownEscape"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a> pages!</p>
<p>TownEscape’s status will turn into developing stage just after this amazing offer to help us will finish and, yes, once again thank you for your support our dear potential TownEscape users!</p></div>","Dear funders, we would like to bring to your attention an unbelievably epic GPS outdoor game based on mobile application. Similar to “Capture the Flag” game TownEscape offers fun and unique gaming experience where ""TownEscapers"" (You!) tend to compete outdoors with each other to win real tangible products. A local town serves as a virtual playground, where all users' location and movements are identified via GPS signal emitted from their mobile devices. The game will be available on iOS, Android, Windows and Blackberry operating systems. On all of these marketplaces this mobile application will be free of charge. After downloading TownEscape on your mobile device, you will be able to use full version of our game!
Step By Step Guide - How It Works?
The purpose of this game is to create fun and unique experience for users, while spending time outdoors with your friends and other people. The most important part is that by competing with others, users are able to win real prizes and products. Your dream is much closer than you think! For example, you can win a car (or any other product) of your dreams just by having fun and competing with others players. Everything now is in your hands!
Step 1 - Download TownEscape on your mobile device

TownEscape will organize most competitions itself. TownEscapers first download the mobile application and when they access it they will see a list of location-based competitions available. Based on TownEscaper’s location, user will be presented with a list of existing or up-coming competitions held in his/her city or the closest city where competitions are being held, for example New York. The list will include different competitions and each of them will have a category, name, short description, number of entrants, final prize and the entrance fee.

By pressing on one of the competitions, TownEscaper will be directed to a full description about this particular competition. In order to take part in one of the competitions user will have to pay an entrance fee (usually small one) or there would be also free competitions. Moreover, the user will be allowed to take part only in one active competition at a time.

Step 2 - Entering Competition
This is where all the fun part starts! After TownEscaper paid the entrance fee he/she will directly receive a map, where his/her current location will be shown (red), the location of the virtual prize (blue) and location of other users (green) participating in this particular game (competition). 

The time in a header shows duration of the competition and when it will finish. Apart from the main menu, when user entered a particular competition, he/she will be presented with a new button called Tools. When TownEscapers will press on Tools tab, they will see a list of available in-game tools they can utilize in this particular competition or if they don’t have any tools purchased before - they will be offered to buy them. At the launch of the game, we will introduce the following in-app purchases (in-game tools):
• Deactivation – Deactivates your opponent for 5 minutes and deactivates him/her from re-catching a product from you.
• Mass Deactivation - Deactivates all your opponents within 100m (328 feet) radius for 5 minutes and deactivates them from re-catching a product from you.
• Invisibility – Makes you invisible for other TownEscapers for 5 minutes. Can’t use this tool when time left (duration) is less than 1 hour for a particular competition.
• Mines – Drops the prize from your opponent’s mobile device and he/she will be unable to pick it up for 2 minutes. You can put mines wherever you want to within a certain area specified for a certain competition.
• Clones – Creates two clones of you that will confuse your opponents.
• Blind – Makes your opponent “blind” by switching off his map for 5 minutes.
• Shield – You ignore all the tools used against you by your opponents for 5 minutes.
As we believe these in-game tools will help you to compete with each other and make your game even more fun to play. We will be adding more in-game tools in the future!
Step 3 – Catch a Virtual Prize on your Mobile Device!
After locating the virtual prize, TownEscaper will have to come closer than 50m (164 feet) in radius to virtual prize in order to catch it on his/her mobile device.

Step 4 - Escape from your Opponents!
Now eScape from the other users, as other TownEscapers will start chasing you as soon as you will catch a virtual prize on your mobile device. Moreover, your opponents will be able to steal the prize from your mobile device if they come closer to you than 50 meters (164 feet) in radius. Don’t forget to utilize your TownEscape in-game tools and your cunning to get away from your opponents!

Step 5 – Keeping your Virtual Prize on your Mobile Device!

They are currently threatened with extinction because of the encroachment of fathomless numbers of humans into their ocean environment.<br/><br/>     The Shark Deep Ones are strong, agile, and extremely adaptable to any style of gameplay or strategy.

</div></div>","Greetings everyone, I am extremely fortunate and proud to stand in
 front of you once again with a new project that will unveil a recently 
discovered race to the loyal and most devoted fans of fantasy football.
     During this festive occasion, it is with sincere joy and honor to 
present a football team that is extremely aggressive, with the capacity 
to intimidate any race that would dare show itself on the football 
pitch.


     
This project is a continuation of the Necronomicon Cthulhu Mythos, it is one of my first projects that combines the horrific personages of HP Lovecraft and fantasy football.  This sculpting project encompasses three years of dedicated passion for not only myself but all the fans of this game.  



     A percentage of the benefits obtained in this campaign will be donatet to FUMBBL to give suport to their web, your help is welcomed.
https://fumbbl.com

Necronomicon II it is a continuation of the same collection Necronomicon I , this time let's dive straight in the city of R'Lyeh and start discovering Fantasy Football players we can find .
 
SHARKS DEEP ONES

     Another critical component of any Cthulhu Mythos football team, are the Deep Ones, most infamously from the Shark blood line. This ancient bloodline inhabited the depths of the forgotten city of R’lyeh. They are currently threatened with extinction because of the encroachment of fathomless numbers of humans into their ocean environment.     The Shark Deep Ones are strong, agile, and extremely adaptable to any style of gameplay or strategy. They are capable of being included on any football team roster. i.e. (Humans, Norses ,Orcs, Elves, Dark Elves, Ratmens, Lizards ,Vampires and even Chaos or Plague)

<p>Medfund is a cost-effective
medical aid program that was established in La Paz, Bolivia in 2014 operating
under the NGO: “Cup of Cold Water Ministries.” This organization provides
financial aid and medical relief of abandoned patients with extreme needs in
the “Hospital General” in the City of La Paz. Volunteers find people with
urgent medical needs, and then evaluate the degree of urgency and the
individual’s financial condition to determine if aid is justified. Medfund then
pays for the person’s most urgent medical bills and treatment, with volunteers
assisting the patient throughout their hospital experience and visiting them
regularly until they are stable. </p>
<p>This organization is gaining
momentum and recognition in La Paz, and has the potential to have even more
significant impact through your support. The American dollar has a much higher
purchasing power in Bolivia, with some patients needing only $20 to survive.
Medfund works at 0% overhead, meaning that 100% of your donations go to
medicine, patient operation, or treatments. </p>

He's a factory 
worker from Syberia where he worked all his life. One day, while he was 
watching a TV program about tempting and mysterious far away islands, 
something ticked in his head. The idea of living on an inhabited island 
seemed wonderful! Shining sun, deep blue ocean, fresh exotic fruits.. 
and all of that for free! It sounded like heaven on Earth! And so he 
realised that his life dream would be to live that way. No job, no 
responsibilities... only a neverending vacation!</p><p>

So, Ivan made a decision immidiately. He sold his flat and got just 
enough money to buy a business class one-way ticket to the Island. With 
no regrets Ivan said “Bye” to Russia and started his way to the new 
life!</p><p>

But something went wrong during the flight. The plane crushed! The only person survived was our hero with his balalaika.</p><p>

On the first page of the story the future seemed not bad at all. Ivan 
was alive, at the Paradise Island, like the dream came true! But the 
first appearance can be deceptive. It turned out that the Island was not
 as perfect as Ivan thought.</p><p>

A wide range of struggles is waiting for our hero in near future. 
Predators, freezing winters (as cold as Syberian) and many others. Now 
Ivan has to learn how to survive: where to get food, how to set fire and
 even how to construct buildings. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245341/files/20131206032203-ing01.png?1386328923"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h2><b>Key features</b></h2><ul>

more like some ""Happy Farm"" stuff and most people wonder how can it be 
of any interest for hardcore gamers? But we don't consider indie and 
hardcore to be always associated with clumsy dark or even inefficient 
graphics. Our graphics is colourful, vivid and lively.</p><p>

Visualisation is in contrast with the very idea of the game — the 
re-born of a human sunk in urbanism, his re-connection with nature. 
There is no particular aim except for survival at any cost. The game is 
based on the variation of combinations, so that you can solve one and 
the same problem in different ways.</p><p>

Except for crafting part there are a lot of random situations: heavy 
rain (the unprotected fire will die out), rotten food, unknown illness, 
tsunami, forest fire, wild animals and many many more. These events will
 considerably diversify the gameplay and won't let you get bored.</p><p>

The exploration of the island is the most important part of the 
gameplay. The map is generated for every player individually so you 
won't be able to act according some unified scheme. We try to vary the 
gaming surroundings as it is very important for us to make this little 
island trip a new and exciting adventure for you.</p><p>

In the game special attention is also paid to the change from one season
 to another. The character finds himself on the island in spring and he 
has to make himself familiar to it before the first winter comes. On the
 one hand it's easier to get fresh water in winter, but on the other 
hand you have to improve your avatar's dwelling. You need to know how to
 build a house and how to maintain fire. And don't forget that animals 
get the way more agitated in winter since it's getting harder to find 
food for them too, so try not to become an easy prey for them.</p><p>

The death of the character means the end of the game. No re-spawns, no saves. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245347/files/20131206032437-ing03.png?1386329077"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h2><b>Screenshots and concepts</b></h2><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245349/files/20131206032511-GUI_HUD_New.jpg?1386329111"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245350/files/20131206032526-GUI_HUD_New_2.jpg?1386329126"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245351/files/20131206032556-GUI_PopUp_Inventory.jpg?1386329156"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245353/files/20131206032623-NmMmY5DYtrg.jpg?1386329183"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245354/files/20131206032641-TreeAssetsConcept08.jpg?1386329201"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245356/files/20131206032653-steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_179038897_preview222.jpg?1386329213"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245357/files/20131206032704-steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_179038897_preview32.jpg?1386329224"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/245358/files/20131206032715-steamworkshop_webupload_previewfile_179038897_preview.jpg?1386329235"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h2>About us</h2><p>We're a small group of developers from Perm

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The AuraVisor has powerful on-board WiFi and a simple smart scrolling graphical user interface. Simply turn on, download and immerse yourself in whatever activity you like. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Users have the ability to download more content, including games, videos and apps from the VR store. The VR store is based on, and linked to, the Google Play Store. You can add more content via micro SD storage. Watch movies in a realistic immersive environment and enjoy 360º content that you've filmed yourself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are working with a number of key partners to deliver more apps and content, including movies, live streaming events, games and educational experiences.

</div>","**********Thank you for all you contributions. Funding is now closed. To purchase an AuraVisor please visit Damson Audio**********  A virtual reality head mounted computer (HMC) that works without a computer or smartphone. Free from the clutter of wires and the hassle of interchanging a smart phone. AuraVisor has an on-board Android based computer that allows you to experience the immersion of virtual reality, and all it offers, without breaking the budget. General Public ReactionThe following video captures the public's reaction while experiencing AuraVisor for the first time.Virtual reality just got accessible to everyone.    Developing AuraVisor means virtual reality is now available for everyone, aimed at casual & pro gamers, intrepid explorers and experience junkies. The AuraVisor can be used straight from the box and doesn't require any specialist knowledge.    The video below shows a demo of the headset rotating 360º with the hardware sensors and software all working.Actual gameplay depicting head tracking movement in real time AuraVisor has been carefully priced to make it accessible to everyone. 
AuraVisor is not just for entertainment, its applications will extend into education and beyond, the recently launched Google Expeditions is something we are very keen to explore and become involved in. VR can already be used to teach complicated medical studies, journey through the inside of the human body or to take a class of 6 years olds to the other side of the world... all without leaving the house.  
AuraVisor Overview

 

 
How it works
The AuraVisor has powerful on-board WiFi and a simple smart scrolling graphical user interface. Simply turn on, download and immerse yourself in whatever activity you like. 
Users have the ability to download more content, including games, videos and apps from the VR store. The VR store is based on, and linked to, the Google Play Store. You can add more content via micro SD storage. Watch movies in a realistic immersive environment and enjoy 360º content that you've filmed yourself.
We are working with a number of key partners to deliver more apps and content, including movies, live streaming events, games and educational experiences. There is already a huge selection of apps and videos ready to use. The AuraVisor will ship with a number of apps and games pre-installed to provide a true ""out of the box"" set up.

 

 
More apps are being added all the time. 
Viewing without wearing glasses
Adjustable optical lenses and depth of field sliders allow you to set up the viewing of your AuraVisor exactly to your own requirements. Leaving you free to view the AuraVisor without wearing glasses in most cases. The AuraVisor has been tested on a wide range of eye prescriptions from short to long sighted and with a strong astigmatism. Our feedback indicates that after set up the viewing is completely normal and extremely comfortable.

 
Detachable Faceplates
The AuraVisor will ship with one adult faceplate. More faceplates can be added if you are looking to share your AuraVisor.

 
We see significant educational applications and have therefore designed a faceplate specifically to be comfortable for children. This will provide great viewing and comfort for children aged from 4 upwards. Additional faceplates should cost no more than £19.99 / $29.99.

 there had been some changes. Especially its going to be fixed to reach
 10 000 eu. That is the minimum what we will need to start this up.  
help us turn this idea into a reality! So please if you like this project you 
can help us turn this idea into a reality. Updated version: Heroes of Quasar updatedPlease contribute to Heroes of Quasar updated version. HoQ is an
upcoming Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) title. Action packed tactical
spaceship battle. Wage a war by yourself or with your friends against the enemies.
Earn resources, upgrade your ship and FIGHT against the other team! Epic
pseudo-3d game with max 3 players on each team, both single and multiplayer,
for mobile and tablet devices. We love
games like Warcraft, Starcraft, Dota and HoN. And we also love space!!! That’s
why we have decided to combine all these great things and create an amazing
looking game! Firstly, we want it for mobile and tablet devices (iOS, android),
as there are not that many games like this for those platforms. Secondly move to PC, MAC, & Linux.  If you share our enthusiasm about sci-fi keep
reading to find out more about our project! 
Two teams, 3 players max on each team, will fight for a win. The victory can be
achieved by killing the enemy heroes or by destroying their mothership. Players
have 2 lives, which means they can re-spawn once after being killed. After that
it is a permanent death!Each player picks one ship at the start of a game next to the mothership. The mothership
is defended by 3 towers and it automatically provides repairs to nearby ships
and sells upgrades for your ship. Upgrades consists of basic upgradable stats
like life, shield, armor, speed, short range and long range weapons and then
special features. Each hero has his own special set of weapons and shields available
for purchase. Upgrades are only applied to their own ship. 
Players have to earn resources by killing the enemy drones and
heroes. Also when one team controls most of the map, that means everyone from that team is behind the middle line
at the enemy territory, it gains bonus of 10% to the gained resources. Drones are deployed from mothership in waves. The games should last about 15 minutes. 
Singleplayer:
Game mode for offline play. A player can practice and have fun against bots. 

Multiplayer:

Too bad you *crash* landed.What is Crashed Lander?This is a gravity-based arcade game inspired by classics like Lunar Lander and Space Taxi. You'll pilot your craft from pad to pad trying to beat your best time – then flirt with that fine line between speed and control. If you’re brave enough to try Hard Mode you’ll be flopping around like a QWOPy, low gravity turtle. With a little practice you’ll be zippin' around doin' barrel rolls. You can also pilot your lander in virtual reality with your Oculus Rift.Download and play the demo now:Windows   |   Mac OS X   |   LinuxContribute to get the XL version of the demo with 4 more levels!You can also support me with your Thumbs Up on Steam Greenlight.You’ll see sites from the cutting edge of fractal mathematics, bizarre organic shapes, arcane archaeological digs, and all manner of WTFderful alien vistas.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>Welcome! We are ""Underground Apartment"", an independent group of game makers located in Toronto, Ontario, CA. As a part of the ""serious gaming"" movement, our mission is to design a role-playing game that impacts the way the world thinks about diversity. Specifically, we want to give gamers worldwide the experiencing of valuing diversity in others, to form interwoven communities where each member plays a vital role, and most importantly, to have fun doing it! We plan to do this with the development and release of ""I, Zombie"", a game that celebrates the unique aspects of zombiehood.<br/><br/>""I, Zombie"" places the player in the role of an awakened zombie in a world where humans and zombies are in savage conflict, with a twist: in order to survive, you must learn to communicate with, interact with, and form a community with other zombies in the world, with the ultimate goal of reuniting with mankind. In the process, you learn about your past and about the lives and aspirations of other zombies. You discover the gifts and talents that make each of these zombies unique, and in doing so, your objective is to team up with other zombies and to form a movement for change in the world. In order to gain momentum, your community will need to grow and flourish over time. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to revolutionize the very definition of zombiehood in this interactive adventure!<br/><br/>""I, Zombie"" also breaks new grounds in the gaming world as the first game to offer a wide variety of accessibility features. Among these are voice commands and navigation, flexible text size and font, magnification of the display, multiple input controller support (including some third-party accessibility interfaces), real-time audio game-state information (such as the location of your character and immediate surroundings), flexible tutorials (only learn what you want to learn), smart navigation, macro support and key mapping, and more! ""I Zombie"" - with your help - will be released on Christmas 2013 on multiple mobile platforms, consoles and PC.<br/><br/>As an independent game development group, we need your help to take this game to the next level - its first full release! To get this game released and available to the world, we are faced with funding challenges for engine licensing, legal costs, console ports, hiring quality art and music developers, servers to support online multiplayer play, team support, and costs for development of the accessibility features. These require tremendous resources, and your support can help us cover these costs and release ""I, Zombie"" to the world by the end of the year. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Your donations will go toward:<br/><br/>$2,500 Engine Licensing: Establishing the I, Zombie ""Inclusion Engine"" as a standard for other game developers to use to easily construct accessible games. This includes costs for patenting and distribution of the engine.<br/><br/>$2,000 Legal Costs: These are the costs for establishing ""I, Zombie"" as an official game by our group.<br/><br/>$3,000 Console Ports: These are the costs for developing and releasing the game on multiple home consoles.<br/><br/>$2,500 Art Assets: ""I, Zombie"" will feature a rich, interactive environment, and this requires a lot of art! In order to release by Christmas of 2013, we need more artists to join the art team, which already features our very own Judith Snow, Michael Skubic, and Alex Hollands!<br/><br/>$2,500 Music Assets: We need help in order to be able to hire musicians, including the famous Peter Gilli to compose the music for this epic adventure. Funding will ensure that we produce quality music for each aspect of the game.<br/><br/>$1,000 Online Multiplayer Feature: The future of ""I, Zombie"" is to be a worldwide multiplayer game. What else would make a fully diverse and peaceful world possible? To reach this most powerful potential, we need zombie players worldwide to help us make that connection.<br/><br/>$4,000 Accessibility Features: We are working to make ""I, Zombie"" accessible to everyone! To develop, test, design and incorporate each of the required features takes time and resources. <br/><br/>$2,000 Team Support: Releasing the game by Christmas of this year will be a challenge, but one we are prepared to meet as an <b>INTERNATIONAL TEAM</b> through dedicated and tireless effort. Your support will ensure that every team member is able to make this commitment by taking care of his/her basic needs during the development phase.<br/><br/>We have set up the following rewards for contributors to thank you for your support:<br/><br/>Shambler ($5): You get our deepest thanks!!!!<br/><br/>Donor ($10): Digital Artbook including art from our renowned artists, Judith Snow and Michael Skubic. Contains original art and character concepts for the game!<br/><br/>Super Donor ($20): The above + the official ""I, Zombie"" digital game soundtrack upon release of the game.<br/><br/>Contributor ($25): The above + an early copy of the game on PC and your name in the credits as a contributor.<br/><br/>Grave Contributor ($50): The above + an early copy of the iPad or tablet version of the game.<br/><br/>Supporter ($100): The above + a digital copy of the game's journal detailing the development process, created and signed by the engine's lead developer, Ramin Tadayon.<br/><br/>Deadly Supporter ($500): A one-hour online inspirational speaking engagement Q&amp;A session with Ramin and/or Judith from ""Underground Apartment""! <br/><br/>Mortifying Supporter ($2000+): Your very own custom-designed in-game character! Limited supply!<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>""I Zombie"" is designed to be fun and it will enact social change. Beneath the interactive gameplay and storyline, it carries with it a message: that when individuals value one another, everyone wins! The widespread release of our game will spread this message to a worldwide audience. <br/><br/>As the first fully accessible game, ""I Zombie"" is also a message to the gaming industry that games are for everyone and that there are simple steps in development to make them that way. The Inclusion Engine on which the game is developed will help other indie game developers design accessible and fun games without extraordinary effort. I Zombie will be the first proof-of-concept in a new wave of accessible gameplay.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Spread the word! ""I, Zombie"" is about social change, and by sharing the message with your friends, you can help us make a difference in the world. We encourage anyone who is interested to share this campaign via Twitter, Facebook or any other social platform.<br/></span></span></div>","Short SummaryWelcome!

<p>Hi there! My name is Erin, and I'm the Creative Director for the game Nevermind - a PC biofeedback-enhanced exploration horror game in which you venture into the minds of trauma patients to discover the truth behind their horrific experiences. Nevermind started as my Interactive Media Graduate Thesis project at the University of Southern California and became a labor of love for a passionate team of engineers, programmers, actors, writers, filmmakers, composers, and designers.</p>

<h2>
<br/><span>What is Nevermind?</span>
</h2>
<p><span>In Nevermind, you play as an employee of the Neurostalgia Institute tasked with uncovering the mysteries</span><span> </span><span>hidden within the repressed memories of trauma victims.  The game places you in situations that range from the</span><span> </span><span>unsettling to downright disturbing - like any good horror experience. The catch, however, is that you can play it</span><span> </span><span>while wearing a GARMIN heart-rate sensor. As a result, the more scared you get, the harder the game becomes -</span><span> </span><span>and, conversely, as you calm down, the game will gradually return to its easier, gentler default state.</span><br/><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Ultimately, you will have to learn how to recognize and manage your stress levels in order to properly play Nevermind. That is</span><span>…</span><span> if you</span><span> </span><span>want to see what's behind that next door...</span><br/><br/><span> </span><br/><span>As a game designer and artist who has always had a flair for the macabre, Nevermind is - in many ways - a</span><span> </span><span>dream project for me. Not only does it give the team and I an opportunity to play with biofeedback, which is</span><span> </span><span>gearing up to be the next frontier in gaming, it also allows us to craft an experience that is both fun and</span><span> </span><span>personally rewarding.  By creating a narrative experience compelling enough that players would want to force</span><span> </span><span>themselves into dark and stressful scenarios to see ""what's next,"" and requiring them to temper their</span><span> </span><span>subconscious anxiety response in order to do so successfully, Nevermind, in many ways, encourages ""true</span><span> </span><span>bravery.""</span><br/><br/><span> </span><span>All in all, we think that's pretty neat!</span><br/><br/><strong><a href=""http://www.nevermindgame.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read more about the game at nevermindgame.com"">Read more about Nevermind at nevermindgame.com</a></strong><br/><br/></p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p><span>Nevermind is what we call a ""proof-of-concept."" We have completed one full level that demonstrates the big-picture of what Nevermind is as well as</span><span> </span><span>what it can be. In this level you can experience the fully fleshed out story, world, and the biofeedback-based dynamics of the game (unfortunately, we are not able to offer the game with the Garmin sensor at this time, but you can easily <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-10997-00-Heart-Rate-Monitor/dp/B000UOD5QM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344375073&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=garmin+heart+rate+monitor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Garmin Heart Rate Sensor on Amazon"">pick up one of your own from Amazon</a> along with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-10999-00-USB-Ant-Stick/dp/B000UO9KSY/ref=sr_1_29?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344375234&amp;sr=1-29&amp;keywords=garmin+heart+rate+usb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""GARMIN USB ANT Dongle on Amazon"">the USB dongle</a> and try it!  We hope to be able to offer the game with a sensor in the near future.  The game has a built in metric algorithm that tracks your playing style to detect elements of stress none-the-less, so you'll still have a very similar experience</span><span>). The experience is about an hour long and will take you on a ride you'll never forget!</span><span> </span><br/><br/><span>This fundraising campaign is to help us get the game (in its current state) out there! Every contribution will help us submit Nevermind to shows and</span><span> </span><span>festivals and will allow us to stock up on sensor hardware to send to press and other interested and influential parties. The more we can get</span><span> </span><span>Nevermind out there, the better a chance it has at one day becoming a full game that can fulfill its full potential (with over 10 unique levels and</span><span> </span><span>many hours of gameplay).</span><span> </span><br/><br/><span> </span><br/><span>Basically, right now we just want to hear what YOU think! So, for supporting the cause, we will minimally send you a copy of the current version of</span><span> </span><span>the game. We're not distributing sensors at this time (the game is fully playable without it) - but, if you're so inclined, you can easily buy them off of</span><span> </span><span>Amazon. Don't worry, we'll send you all the information you need to make sure you get the right one.</span><span> </span><em>PLEASE NOTE: The game is currently PC only. While we hope to have a Mac version available one day, the current version (both the game and biofeedback connection) is incompatable with Apple</em> <em>machines. </em></p>
<p><br/><span> </span><br/><span>All that said, if we don't reach our goal, it won't be the end of the world. Nevermind will still live on in its current state! However, every contribution</span><span> </span><span>will help us establish a stronger future not only for Nevermind, but also for biofeedback-based gaming and for video games willing to work toward</span><span> </span><span>making the world a better place one fun experience at a time.</span><span>  </span><br/> </p>
<p><span> (One last note about the perk: we will send the game to you via email within 2 weeks -often much sooner- after your contribution.)</span></p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.nevermindgame.com/team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Read more about the team at nevermindgame.com/team"">Read more about the team at nevermindgame.com/team</a></strong><br/><br/></p></div>","Hi there! My name is Erin, and I'm the Creative Director for the game Nevermind - a PC biofeedback-enhanced exploration horror game in which you venture into the minds of trauma patients to discover the truth behind their horrific experiences. Nevermind started as my Interactive Media Graduate Thesis project at the University of Southern California and became a labor of love for a passionate team of engineers, programmers, actors, writers, filmmakers, composers, and designers.
 
 
 


What is Nevermind?

In Nevermind, you play as an employee of the Neurostalgia Institute tasked with uncovering the mysteries hidden within the repressed memories of trauma victims.  The game places you in situations that range from the unsettling to downright disturbing - like any good horror experience. The catch, however, is that you can play it while wearing a GARMIN heart-rate sensor. As a result, the more scared you get, the harder the game becomes - and, conversely, as you calm down, the game will gradually return to its easier, gentler default state. Ultimately, you will have to learn how to recognize and manage your stress levels in order to properly play Nevermind. That is… if you want to see what's behind that next door... As a game designer and artist who has always had a flair for the macabre, Nevermind is - in many ways - a dream project for me. Not only does it give the team and I an opportunity to play with biofeedback, which is gearing up to be the next frontier in gaming, it also allows us to craft an experience that is both fun and personally rewarding.  By creating a narrative experience compelling enough that players would want to force themselves into dark and stressful scenarios to see ""what's next,"" and requiring them to temper their subconscious anxiety response in order to do so successfully, Nevermind, in many ways, encourages ""true bravery."" All in all, we think that's pretty neat!Read more about Nevermind at nevermindgame.com
 
 

 
What We Need & What You Get
Nevermind is what we call a ""proof-of-concept."" We have completed one full level that demonstrates the big-picture of what Nevermind is as well as what it can be. In this level you can experience the fully fleshed out story, world, and the biofeedback-based dynamics of the game (unfortunately, we are not able to offer the game with the Garmin sensor at this time, but you can easily pick up one of your own from Amazon along with the USB dongle and try it!  We hope to be able to offer the game with a sensor in the near future.  The game has a built in metric algorithm that tracks your playing style to detect elements of stress none-the-less, so you'll still have a very similar experience). The experience is about an hour long and will take you on a ride you'll never forget! This fundraising campaign is to help us get the game (in its current state) out there! Every contribution will help us submit Nevermind to shows and festivals and will allow us to stock up on sensor hardware to send to press and other interested and influential parties. The more we can get Nevermind out there, the better a chance it has at one day becoming a full game that can fulfill its full potential (with over 10 unique levels and many hours of gameplay).  Basically, right now we just want to hear what YOU think! So, for supporting the cause, we will minimally send you a copy of the current version of the game. We're not distributing sensors at this time (the game is fully playable without it) - but, if you're so inclined, you can easily buy them off of Amazon. Don't worry, we'll send you all the information you need to make sure you get the right one. PLEASE NOTE: The game is currently PC only. While we hope to have a Mac version available one day, the current version (both the game and biofeedback connection) is incompatable with Apple machines. 
 All that said, if we don't reach our goal, it won't be the end of the world. Nevermind will still live on in its current state! However, every contribution will help us establish a stronger future not only for Nevermind, but also for biofeedback-based gaming and for video games willing to work toward making the world a better place one fun experience at a time.   
 (One last note about the perk: we will send the game to you via email within 2 weeks -often much sooner- after your contribution.)
 

 
Other Ways You Can Help
""Hey, Erin, I think Nevermind sounds great but I can't contribute any funds at this time. What should I do?"" 
Well, I'm glad you asked! 
Simply by talking about Nevermind and/or this Indiegogo campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, an airplane, the phone with your mom, etc. would also be very helpful. We're extremely appreciative of those who simply just want to spread the word! 
That said, if you do opt to share the campaign, we encourage you to do so via the fancy, high-tech Indiegogo links provided on this page.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hey, everybody! I'm Talin and I've been gaming for a long time now. Games are my biggest passion, but I don't like only playing them, I love to talk about them, to analyze them and I even make my own games, both at my current job and in my spare time - when I can get any.</p>
<p>I also had a small chemistry with writing since I was a kid, so now in my wiser days I thought why not combine the 2 of them in game reviews. I put up a blog where I write quick reviews that can be read in maximum 5 minutes. I often lack the time and patience to go through the big reviews on famous sites so I mostly resume to the conclusions. I thought that surely there are others like me out there, so this is why I chose this 5 minutes format.</p>
<p>I analyze a game from the graphics, sounds, story, gameplay and longevity perspectives, reaching a conclusion. I avoid to give ratings to a game, as I find those misleading. Since a review will always depend on the personal experience with the game, I only give my opinion as whether you'll hate it, ignore it, like it, love it or even the elusive live it.</p>
<p>This the blog with the reviews, currently only for PS3:</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><a href=""http://5minutesps3reviews.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://5minutesps3reviews.blogspot.com/</a></span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>I want to hear the community's opinion on this little project of mine. I've been writing some reviews so far. I need you guys to show me if this is something worth continuing, if you like my writing style and so on. I write the reviews when I get some spare time and energy, but with your support I can get much more motivated and try to write a new review each 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>I've also been playing with the idea of expanding the whole concept to new consoles: 3DS, PS Vita, maybe even indie PC games. Based on your feedback and support, this will become a reality.</p>
<p>Another quirky idea I have is to put all of this into an online magazine. Each issue would contain at least one PS3, 3DS, Vita and PC review. It would also highlight the most interesting games coming out for each of the platforms.<br/></p>
<p>So, here are my goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1000$</span> - Continue with the 5 minutes PS3 reviews blog, one at each 2-3 weeks at least</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">2000$</span> - Start the 5 minutes 3DS reviews blog, one each 4-6 weeks at least</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">3000$</span> - Start the 5 minutes Vita reviews blog, one each 4-6 weeks at least</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">4000$</span> - Start the 5 minutes PC reviews blog, one each 4-6 weeks at least</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">5000$</span> - Start the 5 minutes reviews magazine, one issue every 2 months</li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/>Looking forward to your feedback!</span><br/><br/>

<h3>What is Coma: a mind adventure?</h3>
<p>In Coma, the main character (you, the player) is in a deep coma after a terrible accident, and the scenarios, humans and entities you encounter are a representation of the feelings of the character; <strong>everything in Coma happens in his head</strong>. He did something terrible in the past (many years ago) and to get out of the coma he will have to forgive himself by finally <strong>accepting who he is and what he did.</strong></p>
<p>The player has the ability to<strong> change the climate and the weather</strong>, and to solve the puzzles you will have to use that! You are the one who decides if it’s nightime, daytime, ifit  rains, if the skies are clear, if there is a terrible fog, and in any one of these states the environment changes radically. There are zones in the environment (the environment is the puzzle) that are sensible to the player and certain objects, and the player must use the characteristics of each macro climatic state to combine them and solve the puzzles.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i799.photobucket.com/albums/yy274/rosquillaman/49-1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who we are?</h3>
<p>We are the main team behind <a href=""http://www.warcelonacampaign.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Warcelona</a>,  one of the most <span>renowned campaigns</span> for Left 4 Dead 2, with more than <a href=""http://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=12111"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">160.000 downloads</a> and a score of 96/100 after more than 150 reviews. But this time we’re not making a mod, now we are ready to make a game!</p>
<p>Coma is a combination of many ideas we have for new videogame mechanics that now we are ready to make a reality. The game will be an FPP (first person puzzler, not first person shooter) with puzzles and a deep and personal story behind it. <span>You won't find Space Marines or meaningless violence in Coma, as opposed to most First Person Shooters.</span> You will find a mature adult story about life;<strong> sadness, violence, remorse, guilt, hope, and what is more important;  <span>self-accomplishment</span>. </strong></p>
<p>If you want to think in terms of reference, Coma is a mix of games like Dear Esther, Portal 2, Shadow of the Colossus or Journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>F.A.Q</h3>
<p><strong>When will Coma be ready for release?</strong></p>
<p>Although we don’t dare set a deadline just yet, we can assure you that it won’t be launched in less than a year, but we won’t take more than two years for it either. It all depends on the amount of income we get from the donations. The more people that contribute, the easier we’ll have it to develop and finish key aspects of the game.</p>
<p><strong>What will the money be used for?</strong></p>
<p>We will use the money gotten from the donations to pay for three main things: the specialists (animators, programmers, musicians, web designers and others) we will hire, the licenses we will have to pay, and the tools and applications that will help us hugely to speed up the development of Coma.</p>
<p><strong>Why Flexible Funding?</strong></p>
<p>We devised Coma to be a project flexible to the amount of contributions obtained, from the very beginning. If we get more than a dollar we’ll release the complete game with a coherent story, but not the depth and length we had initially hoped it to have. To achieve the level of quality and polishment (in that regard) we have set ourselves, we calculate we require a minimum of 7400$. If we get less than that the game will probably lack somehow, but if we surpass that amount then it will be even more detailed and polished than expected.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game be available through Steam?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We have read the Steamwork “rules” and this project fulfills all requirements to be a part of Steam.</p>
<p><strong>Which platforms will Coma be available on?</strong></p>
<p>PC and Mac</p>
<p><strong>Will there be achievements?</strong></p>
<p>Only if we get to 10,000$. There are other, more important things we want to invest the money in before we start working on the achievements</p>
<p><strong>Will the game include scorelists, time-related challenges, and such?</strong></p>
<p>No. We haven’t imagined Coma: A mind adventure as a competitive game</p>
<p><strong>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much do we contributors influence the videogame?</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the level of access to the viral game, between 6 and 10.</p>
<p><strong>How much will the final release of Coma cost?</strong></p>
<p>We don’t know yet, the only thing we know for sure is that paying for the lowest perk (10$) is going to be cheaper than waiting for the final release.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i799.photobucket.com/albums/yy274/rosquillaman/desiertocristal-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<p>If you want to see some gameplay, check our <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=iv&amp;src_vid=WoJUHXRNsZs&amp;annotation_id=annotation_320215&amp;v=mypFCRzWwes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gameplay video</a> and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-S2uDD2IYI&amp;feature=relmfu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our tutorial</a>, that’s the best way to know how Coma works, but here are some specific hints:</p>
<p>We are planning to do different environments like a <strong>forest, a volcanic zone, badlands, an infinite beach, and many other abstract ,natural and huuuuuuge environments</strong> (about 12 different kind of environments). In each of these environments and in all the game the player will be able to play with the climate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fog: the enemies won’t see you unless you’re very close to them and the mist also disables certain elements as force fields (and way more!)</li>
<li>Night: the night activates portals (non bidirectional) and light objects that will only exist during the night</li>
<li>Rain: the rain makes some elements grow and it also floods some areas. The rain is perfect to create new paths or go to high areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>And waaay more! We are planning to make other climatic states such as <strong>tornadoes, burning Sun, eclipse, sand storm,</strong> and others, but we will need funding to do that! Aside from that, there will be 4 levels that will have a very different and unique gameplay (how can you beat a colossus using the climate? :D, for example)</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i799.photobucket.com/albums/yy274/rosquillaman/Interactive%20Landscape/culpabilidadpadremuriendo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How will the narrative work?</h3>
<p>The game will have a slow non frantic rhythm, but it won’t be just an aesthetic experience, because the most important part of the game is solving the puzzles and traveling through the mind of the main character.<br/><strong>Various narrators will join us for the adventure</strong>, but the environmental narrative will be the most important one. These narrators will be relatives, doctors, friends, and others that are in the room where the main character lays in the deep coma, and we will listen to what they say. That will be very important because the mind of the main character will pick up these words and will transform them into environments and puzzles full of metaphors. <span>But the most interesting part is that, as a backer of this proyect, you will be able to influence what these narrators say (among many other things) thanks to the viral alternative reality game (ARG) that will happen during development!</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Viral Game (ARG) during development</h3>
<p>We need the help of your pledge for making this project a reality, and we've got awesome news for the Backers: aside from getting the game for free when it's done, getting concept art and other surprises you will <strong>participate in a viral game during the development process of the game that will determine the destiny of the main character in Coma -</strong>and this won't be standalone-  so everyone will get the consequences of the events in the viral game.</p>

Here is a hint about one thing that will happend in the viral game: it is said that when you're in a coma, you can listen to the real word and this affects you. Imagine that somebody goes to visit the character, and tells him word for word exactly what you have written with the other backers, and in the game, when the player listens to this voice, this will create a scenario surrounding him in real time (like in Inception); in ther words, <strong>the entire scenario/level will be metaphor based on what YOU have written.</strong></p>

What is Coma: a mind adventure?
In Coma, the main character (you, the player) is in a deep coma after a terrible accident, and the scenarios, humans and entities you encounter are a representation of the feelings of the character; everything in Coma happens in his head. He did something terrible in the past (many years ago) and to get out of the coma he will have to forgive himself by finally accepting who he is and what he did.
The player has the ability to change the climate and the weather, and to solve the puzzles you will have to use that! You are the one who decides if it’s nightime, daytime, ifit  rains, if the skies are clear, if there is a terrible fog, and in any one of these states the environment changes radically. There are zones in the environment (the environment is the puzzle) that are sensible to the player and certain objects, and the player must use the characteristics of each macro climatic state to combine them and solve the puzzles.

 
Who we are?
We are the main team behind Warcelona,  one of the most renowned campaigns for Left 4 Dead 2, with more than 160.000 downloads and a score of 96/100 after more than 150 reviews. But this time we’re not making a mod, now we are ready to make a game!
Coma is a combination of many ideas we have for new videogame mechanics that now we are ready to make a reality. The game will be an FPP (first person puzzler, not first person shooter) with puzzles and a deep and personal story behind it. You won't find Space Marines or meaningless violence in Coma, as opposed to most First Person Shooters. You will find a mature adult story about life; sadness, violence, remorse, guilt, hope, and what is more important;  self-accomplishment. 
If you want to think in terms of reference, Coma is a mix of games like Dear Esther, Portal 2, Shadow of the Colossus or Journey.
 
F.A.Q
When will Coma be ready for release?
Although we don’t dare set a deadline just yet, we can assure you that it won’t be launched in less than a year, but we won’t take more than two years for it either. It all depends on the amount of income we get from the donations. The more people that contribute, the easier we’ll have it to develop and finish key aspects of the game.
What will the money be used for?
We will use the money gotten from the donations to pay for three main things: the specialists (animators, programmers, musicians, web designers and others) we will hire, the licenses we will have to pay, and the tools and applications that will help us hugely to speed up the development of Coma.
Why Flexible Funding?
We devised Coma to be a project flexible to the amount of contributions obtained, from the very beginning. If we get more than a dollar we’ll release the complete game with a coherent story, but not the depth and length we had initially hoped it to have. To achieve the level of quality and polishment (in that regard) we have set ourselves, we calculate we require a minimum of 7400$. If we get less than that the game will probably lack somehow, but if we surpass that amount then it will be even more detailed and polished than expected.
Will the game be available through Steam?
Yes. We have read the Steamwork “rules” and this project fulfills all requirements to be a part of Steam.
Which platforms will Coma be available on?
PC and Mac
Will there be achievements?
Only if we get to 10,000$. There are other, more important things we want to invest the money in before we start working on the achievements
Will the game include scorelists, time-related challenges, and such?
No. We haven’t imagined Coma: A mind adventure as a competitive game
On a scale from 1 to 10, how much do we contributors influence the videogame?
Depending on the level of access to the viral game, between 6 and 10.
How much will the final release of Coma cost?
We don’t know yet, the only thing we know for sure is that paying for the lowest perk (10$) is going to be cheaper than waiting for the final release.
 

Gameplay
If you want to see some gameplay, check our gameplay video and our tutorial, that’s the best way to know how Coma works, but here are some specific hints:
We are planning to do different environments like a forest, a volcanic zone, badlands, an infinite beach, and many other abstract ,natural and huuuuuuge environments (about 12 different kind of environments). In each of these environments and in all the game the player will be able to play with the climate:

Fog: the enemies won’t see you unless you’re very close to them and the mist also disables certain elements as force fields (and way more!)
Night: the night activates portals (non bidirectional) and light objects that will only exist during the night
Rain: the rain makes some elements grow and it also floods some areas. The rain is perfect to create new paths or go to high areas.

And waaay more! We are planning to make other climatic states such as tornadoes, burning Sun, eclipse, sand storm, and others, but we will need funding to do that! Aside from that, there will be 4 levels that will have a very different and unique gameplay (how can you beat a colossus using the climate? :D, for example)



How will the narrative work?
The game will have a slow non frantic rhythm, but it won’t be just an aesthetic experience, because the most important part of the game is solving the puzzles and traveling through the mind of the main character.Various narrators will join us for the adventure, but the environmental narrative will be the most important one. These narrators will be relatives, doctors, friends, and others that are in the room where the main character lays in the deep coma, and we will listen to what they say. That will be very important because the mind of the main character will pick up these words and will transform them into environments and puzzles full of metaphors. But the most interesting part is that, as a backer of this proyect, you will be able to influence what these narrators say (among many other things) thanks to the viral alternative reality game (ARG) that will happen during development!


Viral Game (ARG) during development
We need the help of your pledge for making this project a reality, and we've got awesome news for the Backers: aside from getting the game for free when it's done, getting concept art and other surprises you will participate in a viral game during the development process of the game that will determine the destiny of the main character in Coma -and this won't be standalone-  so everyone will get the consequences of the events in the viral game.
The more you pledge, the more power you will have to affect the game! But this is not the only thing you can do in the viral game. Anyone that's in the viral game will know more about the character, the context, his work, his past and more so when you play the game you will recognize every detail, every metaphor, every hint.

This viral game will be done though the internet; viral facebook accounts, viral characters, viral websites, viral newspapers, and others. Here is a hint about one thing that will happend in the viral game: it is said that when you're in a coma, you can listen to the real word and this affects you. Imagine that somebody goes to visit the character, and tells him word for word exactly what you have written with the other backers, and in the game, when the player listens to this voice, this will create a scenario surrounding him in real time (like in Inception); in ther words, the entire scenario/level will be metaphor based on what YOU have written.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Project Beanstalk is a socially responsible video game company whose mission is to create a state of mindfulness throughout the world by fixing the game industry’s lack of diversity and all of the negative issues that come with it. This includes the lack of minorities in the workplace, behavior that creates toxic gaming communities (such as hazing) and poor representation of marginalized groups in video games.</p> <p>In order to improve the state of the video game industry and create a space for individuals to understand each other for more than just stereotypes, we create video games with better representation of marginalized groups including but not limited to people of color, women, the LGBTQ community, disabled people, and low income individuals.</p>
<p>As a socially responsible company we welcome opportunities to address other social themes through our games such as bullying, mental health, corruption &amp; power, and environmental issues.</p>

This hurts the confidence of these individuals and they lose faith in the idea that they can pursue successful careers as game developers.

Project Beanstalk is a socially responsible video game company whose mission is to create a state of mindfulness throughout the world by fixing the game industry’s lack of diversity and all of the negative issues that come with it. This includes the lack of minorities in the workplace, behavior that creates toxic gaming communities (such as hazing) and poor representation of marginalized groups in video games. In order to improve the state of the video game industry and create a space for individuals to understand each other for more than just stereotypes, we create video games with better representation of marginalized groups including but not limited to people of color, women, the LGBTQ community, disabled people, and low income individuals.
As a socially responsible company we welcome opportunities to address other social themes through our games such as bullying, mental health, corruption & power, and environmental issues.
Many individuals from marginalized groups aspire to work in the video game industry, however, they are held back by the lack of awareness and lack of access that surrounds it. This hurts the confidence of these individuals and they lose faith in the idea that they can pursue successful careers as game developers. We aim to work against this preconceived notion by using our work as a diverse team of developers to inspire these individuals and show them that they can succeed in the game industry because we are doing it.

We Need Your Support For A Successful Launch
We are a passionate team with a strong dynamic but we are in need of funds to help us grow. Your donations will be going into resources that will help us develop and release our games including:

An account upgrade for Unity3D which costs $125 per month and will be used to give more of our team members the ability to work on our games. 
Payroll for the Beanstalk team to prioritize our current project.
Hiring fees for consultants to improve the quality of our games including programmers, game designers, and marketers.      

60% of the funds will be used to support our team as they continue to work on and finish our games.  20% of the funds will be invested into hire consultants in order to improve the quality of our products.  The remaining 20% will be used to acquire resources that we need including but not limited to a Unity license upgrade and an office space.
Our Games
Here are our current projects that your donations will be supporting! You can find descriptions and news on their progress on our projects page!

<p>Con la ampliación, incrementaremos el número de PCs hasta 12 para hacer los deseados torneos 5vs5 de League of Legends, CSGO, Smite y 6vs6 de Overwatch.

<h2> </h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Carlos Teschendorff. As you know, the actual capacity of the eSports bar is not enough for big parties, events and tournaments. Now the time has come to expand it with the adjacent store! (115 square meters) That store already belongs to me and we have set it up in order to start the building work as soon as possible. With both stores we will reach the 215 square meters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through the expansion, we will increase the number of PCs until 12 in order to make the wanted League of Legends, Smite, CS:GO 5vs5 and Overwatch 6vs6 tournaments. Besides, we will be able to host bigger events of your favorite topics: Harry Potter, Star Wars, Pirates, Disney, ….</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to renovate the existing facility we precise 24.000 euros. With the crowdfunding campaign we have to raise 8.000 euros, I will raise the remaining 16.000 euros through a bank loan. If we are able to raise a fair amount of money through crowdfunding, the loan will have better interest rates. If we don’t raise enough money, we will continue with a lighter expansion or we’ll pay back everything (minus the 5% that Indiegogo takes).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have some unique perks that are only available once and many more common ones.</p>
<p>Furthermore, everyone will get additional extras whenever we reach certain goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.000 euros Incredible cosplayers for the re-opening party</p>
<p>3.500 euros 6vs6 Overwatch tournament with 300 euros prize pool</p>
<p>5.000 euros 5vs5 League of Legends and CS:GO tournament with 300 euros prize pool each one</p>
<p>6.500 euros 5vs5 Smite, 1vs1 Hearthstone and 1vs1 Super Smash Bros tournament with 300 euros each one</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>How the bar will look like</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PCs and consoles area</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The PC area will have 12 Alienware computers, Logitech peripherals, 12 NeedforSeat gaming chairs as well as two independent internet connections in case one fails. In the console area we will have two Wii U, two Nintendo Switch, one Playstation 3, one Playstation 4, one pump it up dance machine and four controllers per console. Of course,<a name=""_GoBack"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a> using all this stuff will still be for free with some changes. When getting a drink, you will get a one-hour session on a PC. After this time, the session will disconnect and somebody else will take up the PC.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Streaming Area</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There will be 2 areas with sofas where you can accommodate and enjoy the hottest streamings (LVP, LCS, ESL Major League, …) In order to decorate the new area with sofas, we will get Monster partnership, and this area will receive the name of “Monster Zone”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the central area there will be a space for 9 tables, so people can sit, drink, chat and meet new people. Of course, you will always be able to watch one of the TVs spread around the room so that you don’t miss your favorite teams or players.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will build a new, U-shaped counter so that you don’t have to stand in line to get a drink or a snack ever again</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course there are risks. The creation of innovative businesses always take risk. The building work can stretch on or the building work cost can increase. But I'm prepared for this kind of incidents. After two years running this eSports bar I count with it. If I have learnt something after these two years is dealing with problems and crisis. After one crisis there's an opportunity. You just have to carry on and I'm a specialist on that. I said I was going to open the first eSports in Spain and I did it. Now it's not me anymore,but us. We have dreamed so many times of expanding the bar ... and that's what we are going to do right now! Why? Because this is our way of life. Because we have created this Community altogether. Because we can't let it die. Because it has to keep growing. Because many of our actual friends belong to this Community. And because we want to keep sharing unique moments with them. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Because if this; I ask you for your confidence. Give it to me and I assure that you have the most incredible eSports bar in Spain.</p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>In order to make Steampunker available for release on iPhone and Android tablets, we need to raise $2000. We listen carefully to the feedback offered by gamers playing  the iPad version and with your help we'd like to add several gamer-friendly features in the process. We are already working on it  but we need more funding. Once the goal is reached, the improved version for iPad, iPhone and Android tablets will  be ready no later than in January 2015. We are proud of the unique graphics and atmosphere of the game and these certainly won't change.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The game will be available for the following devices:</p>
<p>1) iPad: iPad 2 or newer, iPad mini or newer, iOS 7 or higher </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">2) iPhone: iPhone 4s, iPhone 5,5c,5s iPhone 6, 6+,   iOS 7 or higher </span></p>
<p>3) Android: over 500 devices - Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) or higher, minimum resolution 1024x800, minimum diagonal 8 inches</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Then we would like to translate the game to several languages including French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish. The stretch goal is $ 3000 for  the first set of three languages: German, Japanese and Polish. The language versions are planned for March/April 2015. Once we  reach the goal,  we'll start raisinng funds for  another set of languages. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/965686/files/20141028081109-Title.png?1414509069"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As recording musicians we'd like to release the soundtrack on a special limited edition CD.  $7000 is the stretch goal for this. If the goal is reached we'll send out the CDs in January 2015.</p>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/965710/files/20141028081944-Disk-and-Cover-Presentation-Mock-up.png?1414509584"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>If we are able to make the stretch goal of $10,000, the design team will also develop an option of playing Steampunker as a female character. It's going to require a lot of work but we hope to finish it by April 2015.</p>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Even if we fall short of our goal, all the funds raised will still go directly into developing Android and iPhone versions of Steampunker. It will simply take us much longer to produce them. Similarly, even if we don't meet our stretch goals, anything raised beyond the initial $2000 will go into funding language versions, but production will be slowed down until we are able to find additional sources of funding. By meeting our target amount and our stretch goals, we can go ahead and get everything done right away. That means more fun video games for you as soon as possible!</span><br/>

We are a video game company from Poland and the creators of Steampunker, a puzzle-based adventure game which is already available for iPad. 



The game was selected and nominated for several awards. We've received critical acclaim for Steampunker, but we want to make it even better and make it playable on other video game platforms. And to do that, we need your help.







Steampunker is the story of Vincent, an inventor and engineer, who must save the world from the invasion of evil robots. Traveling through grim harbors, fantastical submarines, mysterious islands, a rocket trip to the Moon, and finally a death-defying battle against the robots on their space ship, Vincent risks everything to save the world and make the universe a little bit safer for Science.




Antyweb.pl: 'Graphics are Steampunker's strongest point. The backdrops of locations traversed by our hero, as well as the graphics accompanying the subsequent puzzles and brain-teasers, all create a unique alluring atmosphere. The game is simply stunning.'


Shaun Musgrave, Touch Arcade: ‘Steampunker is a fairly interesting hybrid of point and click adventure and hidden object searching from a developer hailing from Poland. It kind of reminded me of those games that were big in the early PC CD-ROM days. The art style in this one is pretty cool, and for some reason, having a digitized actor in a costume on top of a computer generated background stirred up some nostalgia in me.’


Chiho Komoriya, vsmedia: ‘…the artwork is wonderful! If you love Steampunk, you are attracted by the nostalgic, decadent atmosphere that this has. This is an interactive art work as well as a game.’

Yulia Vakhrusheva, Casual Connect: 'Steampunker is more than a point-and-click adventure. It's suspenseful atmosphere keeps you hooked until the end - it felt like reading an exciting sci-fi book and being part of its story! '

<p>
</p>
<p>Covenanters is a Collectible Card Game. You
will become a Contractor and build a deck composed of Heroes sent by the five
Gods along with Minion and Effect cards to resist the creator, Luoja, and start
a battle to protect the world. You can also battle other Contractors to perfect
your skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The
rules of battle are simple.         </p>
<p>          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455168522/ayxncegrqwlodiwxnhbz.png"" src="""" style=""width: 540.41px;height: 292px;""/></p>
<p>When
the battle starts, you will receive a hand with five randomly drawn cards from
a deck of 30 cards.             </p>
<p>                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455168581/nb6neu0e5swkswq62uxj.png"" src="""" style=""width: 445.08px;height: 257px;""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p> When you drag one of these cards to the
field, it will summon a Minion or trigger an Effect. In this game you become
victorious if you defeat the opponent’s hero by using various Minions and
Effect cards.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> The unique characteristic of Covenanters is
that the battles are in real-time. Because the summon stage, in which cards are
used, is in real-time, the strategy unfolds in a uniquely fun way as players
adapt to the ever-changing situations based on the interaction between users.</p>

<p>You
will notice a difference from previous turn-based card game battles. Since you
don’t have to wait for the opponent’s move, the game progresses swiftly with
various strategies only possible in real-time.</p>
<p>There
are two types of cards used in Covenanters.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Minion
cards are deployed on the battlefield along with the hero and carry out the
battle. Most Minions attack the enemy with their own skill or support friendly
forces, but sometimes they can be used in various ways to strike an enemy’s
weak point. Building a Minion deck befitting your strategy and deploying them
in the right battlefield situation is the way to become a great Contractor.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455179599/j2paj2ld8otmlgkxvrty.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Different
from Minions, Effect cards disappear after triggering an effect. But you must
not take them lightly even when they disappear. An Effect card can change the
tide of battle in a single motion, or a combination of Effect cards can utterly
confuse the other player.</p>

<p>The
Hero is the most important being in battle. The player who lowers the health of
the opponent’s Hero to zero becomes the victor.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Each Hero can only use race cards of the
Divine he or she serves. For example, Angra Mainyu (the Demon God) only permits
Demon Faction cards and a user who serves Angra Mainyu can only use Demon
Faction cards.</p>
<p>

There
are a total of five gods, and each faction has its own characteristic.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>- Machine Faction (Main God: Machina)</p>
<p>During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are good defense and effective physical damage.</p>
<p>- Angel Faction (Main God: Gabriel)</p>
<p>During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are excellent health and effective magic damage.</p>
<p>- Demon Faction (Main God: Angra Mainyu)</p>
<p>During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are powerful attacks and effective debuffs.</p>
<p>- Human Faction (Main God: Odin)</p>
<p>During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are Minions with low summon cost and effective Buff.</p>
<p>- Monster Faction (Main God: Leviathan)</p>
<p>During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are Minions with high summon cost and effective regeneration.</p>
<p>You can choose one Hero from numerous
choices to combine with 30 cards and create your own strategy to resist Luoja
or strengthen your power by battling other Contractors</p>

<p>Hello. I am ExCore Representative Jin. I am
once again feeling the nervousness and anticipation that I had when I first
experienced the real-time card battle of Covenanters. Covenanters is a result
of a lot of trial and error, applying a real-time element to the card battle.
We have experienced financial hardships, like most small game companies, but
have developed the game with the happy anticipation of introducing Covenanters
to the world. I wish to share this new joy of real-time card battles with other
users and look forward to exciting battles. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello, I am Alot, and I am working as the
generalist at ExCore. Although the development period was not always smooth, we
have enjoyed experimenting with the decks and development of the game. We did
not give up, and eventually we were able to make it this far. We have more
mountains to climb, but I hope Covenanters will have a successful debut. I
would be grateful for your support of Covenanters and Team ExCore.</p>

<p>Covenanters is entering the final stage of
development. We are planning to officially start services by March. Our plan for the first phase is to launch on the Android Market
(North America, Korea), and to launch in App Store during the second phase.</p>
<p>The reason for our fundraising is to
acquire funds for additional updates. We have several planned additions such as
new cards, new heroes, new story modes and various hero skills, but development
has been postponed due to insufficient funds. If fundraising is successful, we
will be able to launch these updates.</p>
<p><strong>100% Attainment</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455100395/ewitjfnvwhsvdrxpucpy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>20 new additional cards (total 100 cards)
will be added for each Divine (Odin, Machina, Gabriel, Angra Mainyu and
Leviathan) factions. More strategic elements will be added.</p>
<p><strong>300% Attainment</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455100422/oliru3rhkk8xs94nlzyg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>A new Hero will be added for each Divine
(Odin, Machina, Gabriel, Angra Mainyu and Leviathan) factions. You can expect
even more charismatic Heroes to be created. A unique skill will also be added
for each Hero. Look forward to each Hero having unique individual skills.</p>
<p><strong>400% Attainment</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455100444/f8ayurrkiqbkjytz7ie3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, each Hero will be able to serve an
additional Divine. They can get strength from two divines and use cards from
two worlds. For example, a guest hero of Angra Mainyu (Demon God) can get
strength from Gabriel (Angel God) and build a deck with both demon and angel
faction cards. Build an even more effective deck of your own.</p>
<p><strong>600% Attainment</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455100580/c7qchngwa7ydquv8vw0c.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Short SummaryHello. We hope 2016 will be full of joyous moments for you.We at Team ExCore present “Covenanters,” a real-time Card Battle Game that we are currently developing.Covenanters would be best understood as a card battle game such as “Magic: The Gathering” and “Hearthstone”, combined with real-time elements. Similar to but different from duels of traditional TCGs, Team ExCore members have already experienced the joy that only real-time card battles can bring through the prototype development. We are continuing to develop the game because we wish to share this fun with many others.If you want to experience a new strategy game experience, read what we have to say!!! Experience the suspense that real-time card battles with other players can provide!!Overview of the World 
The creator and king of the Divine, Luoja,
has concluded that Mortals professed to worship him and the Divine but didn’t
wish to live as he intended, so he has declared the world to doom.
Some of the Divine (Odin, Machina Gabriel,
Angra Mainyu and Leviathan) granted strength to Mortals who wished to fight for
their world and made them into Contractors, and together they defied Luoja.
The Contractors can summon Heroes sent by
the Divine and warriors from other worlds to start battles in defense of their
world.  Game Introduction


Covenanters is a Collectible Card Game. You
will become a Contractor and build a deck composed of Heroes sent by the five
Gods along with Minion and Effect cards to resist the creator, Luoja, and start
a battle to protect the world. You can also battle other Contractors to perfect
your skills.

The
rules of battle are simple.         
          
When
the battle starts, you will receive a hand with five randomly drawn cards from
a deck of 30 cards.             
                       


 When you drag one of these cards to the
field, it will summon a Minion or trigger an Effect. In this game you become
victorious if you defeat the opponent’s hero by using various Minions and
Effect cards.


 The unique characteristic of Covenanters is
that the battles are in real-time. Because the summon stage, in which cards are
used, is in real-time, the strategy unfolds in a uniquely fun way as players
adapt to the ever-changing situations based on the interaction between users.


Next
is a PVP video prepared by our team.

You
will notice a difference from previous turn-based card game battles. Since you
don’t have to wait for the opponent’s move, the game progresses swiftly with
various strategies only possible in real-time.
There
are two types of cards used in Covenanters.


Minion
cards are deployed on the battlefield along with the hero and carry out the
battle. Most Minions attack the enemy with their own skill or support friendly
forces, but sometimes they can be used in various ways to strike an enemy’s
weak point. Building a Minion deck befitting your strategy and deploying them
in the right battlefield situation is the way to become a great Contractor.


Different
from Minions, Effect cards disappear after triggering an effect. But you must
not take them lightly even when they disappear. An Effect card can change the
tide of battle in a single motion, or a combination of Effect cards can utterly
confuse the other player.





Next
let’s take a look at the Heroes of Covenanters.


The
Hero is the most important being in battle. The player who lowers the health of
the opponent’s Hero to zero becomes the victor.


Each Hero can only use race cards of the
Divine he or she serves. For example, Angra Mainyu (the Demon God) only permits
Demon Faction cards and a user who serves Angra Mainyu can only use Demon
Faction cards.


There
are a total of five gods, and each faction has its own characteristic.


- Machine Faction (Main God: Machina)
During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are good defense and effective physical damage.
- Angel Faction (Main God: Gabriel)
During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are excellent health and effective magic damage.
- Demon Faction (Main God: Angra Mainyu)
During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are powerful attacks and effective debuffs.
- Human Faction (Main God: Odin)
During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are Minions with low summon cost and effective Buff.
- Monster Faction (Main God: Leviathan)
During game play, the faction’s
characteristics are Minions with high summon cost and effective regeneration.
You can choose one Hero from numerous
choices to combine with 30 cards and create your own strategy to resist Luoja
or strengthen your power by battling other Contractors

new cards, new heroes, new story modes and various hero skills, but development
has been postponed due to insufficient funds. If fundraising is successful, we
will be able to launch these updates.
100% Attainment



20 new additional cards (total 100 cards)
will be added for each Divine (Odin, Machina, Gabriel, Angra Mainyu and
Leviathan) factions. More strategic elements will be added.
300% Attainment



A new Hero will be added for each Divine
(Odin, Machina, Gabriel, Angra Mainyu and Leviathan) factions. You can expect
even more charismatic Heroes to be created. A unique skill will also be added
for each Hero. Look forward to each Hero having unique individual skills.
400% Attainment



Finally, each Hero will be able to serve an
additional Divine. They can get strength from two divines and use cards from
two worlds. For example, a guest hero of Angra Mainyu (Demon God) can get
strength from Gabriel (Angel God) and build a deck with both demon and angel
faction cards. Build an even more effective deck of your own.
600% Attainment


Hero, UR and SR minions will be given
voices. This will make the game more dynamic.
Various backgrounds and sound effects will
be added as well.
