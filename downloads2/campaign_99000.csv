<p>We are delighted to say that we are set on our first mission trip as a married couple as we head back to Nicaragua this July.

</p><p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>BREAK THE CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS…! </p>
<p>We are a not-for-profit entity and our goal is to
break the cycle of homelessness around the world in 34 different locations. Our
facilities won’t just provide a shelter, but we will also give counselling to
address the issues that first caused homelessness and address the issues
associated with being homeless. We will then provide life skills training (eg.
cooking, driving etc) and vocational/job training – with the aim of attaining
independent living and permanent work.</p>
<p>We don't want to just provide a band-aid approach,
like shelters, but a permanent achievable solution.</p>
<p><b>The Campaign</b></p>
<p>To start with we have commissioned
a song by the amazing artist ‘<i>Tinderbox’,</i>to raise awareness of homelessness and the wonderful Leo
Guardo is directing the music video. Both Tinderbox and Leo (Tauronox
Production Company) have given of their time and efforts all free-of-charge!</p>
<p>So, that means, we are now ready
to shoot the video, but we are looking for funding for the costs of the music
video (eg. equipment hire, insurance, actors, permits etc, etc) and to help
promote the song so that its effectiveness is fully capitalised.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We would love to raise $20,000 that way we can do a
fantastic job on the video and promote it around the world… the final aim is
for the song to do brilliantly, we can then sell it on iTunes and use the funds
to continue our amazing project.</p>
<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p><b>Donations of
$20</b> - be the first to download the song <i>'HOME'</i> </p>
<p><b>Donations of
$100</b> or more - exclusive access the music
video launch, get to see the music video a full 24 hours before the launch. </p>
<p><b>Donations of
$1000</b> or more - VIP attendance at the song
&amp; music video launch, mingle with celebrities and be one of the first in
the world to see the Leo Guardo directed video of 'HOME' by the phenomenal
Tinderbox.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Like we said, our Program aim is to reduce the cycle
of homelessness worldwide. We will also be self-supporting, yes, that's right,
self-supporting. We plan to open complementary businesses, which will provide
work-experience training for the homeless residents, while at the same time
providing profits back into the organisation. </p>
<p>Obviously, we need your help to get started, but we
don’t want to rely on any one Government to provide funding, because we aim to
be a truly global organisation. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Obviously our biggest challenge will be to raise
adequate funds to start with, but our diversity will help overcome this
challenge. That is, we don't expect to raise all the funds necessary in just
one place – but through crowd funding, the song music video, fund-raising and
donations. We are absolutely humbled by how wonderful people have been so far,
so we are very optimistic that we can achieve our goal…!</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We know that not everyone can
afford to donate money, but perhaps you can help in other ways.</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>Donate your time – perhaps you can help us by giving

<p>2.<span>  </span>Use your networks, maybe you could help to promote us

People can make a small donation or a larger contribution...there is no contribution that is too small or too large...you can just give whatever you feel is appropriate for you!</p><p><span style=""color: #008080;""><strong>What's our project</strong></span></p><p>So now we are asking for your support to achieve one of our dreams, which will also be a project that we hope can benefit all of you, to anyone who wants a place to escape to, to relax and get away from the constant pressures of our modern world. We are looking to create a place where you can relax and unwind, that doesn't cost the earth and isn't at the cost of the Earth either. We know that most of you want a place you can go to unwind that doesn't conflict with your ideals of minimising your impact on the environment. </p><p>We believe, as Gandhi famously said, that to change the world, we have to change as individuals. Through the practices of yoga and meditation personal transformation can take place in a gentle way, and we naturally become calmer and more accepting of ourselves and the world around us, allowing us to be more open-minded and less judgemental of ourselves and others.</p><p>I have gone through dramatic, profound changes through the practice and that's why I love to share my own experiences with others, I believe that these practices can help us to live more intelligently, healthily and happily.</p><p><span style=""color: #008080;""><strong>What is Phase One?</strong></span> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485699290/wkg1pyo8ohro44rxotwu.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p><p>Phase one is to create an environmentally low impact, Self Catering Retreat Centre. Guests and Retreats leaders will be housed in 6 wooden cabins or yurts, with each cabin housing 2 single beds. A separate Kitchen cabin for group use with basic facilities for cooking and eating together. A cabin for showers, with water heated by solar water heater.

The current retreat situation on Sardinia is that you can either stay at a hotel, which may or may not have an area such as a terrace or patio you can use for classes, but almost certainly won't be set up specifically or exclusively for your group to use whenever they want, or you might find a Yoga/Meditation centre that has no accommodation and therefore you have to organise accommodation at a local B&amp;B or hotel and then travel to the practice space separately. This tends to be a little inconvenient and often pretty costly!</p><p>We want to offer an affordable, tranquil, eco-friendly space for retreat-goers and organisers to enjoy. Sardinia is easy to get to, there are 3 airports on the island.

People can make a small donation or a larger contribution...there is no contribution that is too small or too large...you can just give whatever you feel is appropriate for you!What's our projectSo now we are asking for your support to achieve one of our dreams, which will also be a project that we hope can benefit all of you, to anyone who wants a place to escape to, to relax and get away from the constant pressures of our modern world. We are looking to create a place where you can relax and unwind, that doesn't cost the earth and isn't at the cost of the Earth either. We know that most of you want a place you can go to unwind that doesn't conflict with your ideals of minimising your impact on the environment. We believe, as Gandhi famously said, that to change the world, we have to change as individuals. Through the practices of yoga and meditation personal transformation can take place in a gentle way, and we naturally become calmer and more accepting of ourselves and the world around us, allowing us to be more open-minded and less judgemental of ourselves and others.I have gone through dramatic, profound changes through the practice and that's why I love to share my own experiences with others, I believe that these practices can help us to live more intelligently, healthily and happily.What is Phase One? Phase one is to create an environmentally low impact, Self Catering Retreat Centre. Guests and Retreats leaders will be housed in 6 wooden cabins or yurts, with each cabin housing 2 single beds. A separate Kitchen cabin for group use with basic facilities for cooking and eating together. A cabin for showers, with water heated by solar water heater. And finally  a couple of environmentally sound, water saving composting toilets.Phase One also includes the project to redesign and refurbish the pool to create an area for swimming and an area with specialist aquatic plants, waterfall and fish to clean the water naturally without the need for chemicals. And along with that, create an area around the pool for chilling and reading.What is Phase Two?We have a very large barn which in the future, we would like to convert into a more permanent, all weather, all year retreat centre, with and indoor Shala, ensuite rooms and proper facilities for people with disabilities. If our goal is surpassed and we raise far more funds that we expect, all proceeds will be held, and ring-fenced, for Phase Two..but that's for a later date..back to Phase One!    What have we done so far?We haven't been sat around waiting for things to happen, we really want this all to work..so we've made a start!
We have bought the land (3 hectares) of tranquil, unspoilt Sardinian paradise!
We have created an outdoor Zen space for classes, with enough space for about 10-12 people on yoga mats.
We already have a concrete pool...it just needs a bit of TLC and conversion to a natural, chemical free pool!
We've started groundworks, and landscaping of the land with a view to the future...
 
Here is a little amateur video of the Zen Outdoor Shala that we have created, just to show the kind of atmosphere we are trying to create:

(I know, I know...it's very amateur, what can I say, I am a yoga teacher not a movie director!!)
 Why would people want to use this centre?I already get plenty of emails each year from teachers from all over the world looking for a bespoke retreat centre for their annual getaway. The current retreat situation on Sardinia is that you can either stay at a hotel, which may or may not have an area such as a terrace or patio you can use for classes, but almost certainly won't be set up specifically or exclusively for your group to use whenever they want, or you might find a Yoga/Meditation centre that has no accommodation and therefore you have to organise accommodation at a local B&B or hotel and then travel to the practice space separately. This tends to be a little inconvenient and often pretty costly!We want to offer an affordable, tranquil, eco-friendly space for retreat-goers and organisers to enjoy. Sardinia is easy to get to, there are 3 airports on the island. This area of Sardinia is spectacular, we benefit from being surrounded by amazing beaches, stunning mountains, natural pools, waterfalls, amazing canyons and totally unspolit mediterranean countryside. The air here has recently been surveyed as one of the cleanest and most unpolluted air in Europe. Locally on offer from various operators you can arrange extra-curricular activities and excursions, a selection of what is on offer: Climbing, Hiking, Cycling, Kayaking, Surfing, Kite Surfing, Paddle Boarding, Boat excursions, Cave excursions, Vineyard visits, etc...   
Here is just a little sample of some of the spectacular scenery of the local area from a couple of local tourism associations:
        
 
 For retreat leaders/OrganisersWe want to create a place you can hire exclusively, you will be the only group here, so there are no conflicts about what time you can do your classes, the space is bespoke and created specifically with a view to be used by groups who want a quiet, reflective space with a tranquil energy...you're not going to hear the other guests, kids and adults, screaming and splashing in the pool...this will be your space!

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>We are two passionate Mountainboarders from Germany tirelessly waiting for a innovative and lightweight deck to appear on the market. There had been some good innovations in the past but there was always something that did not satisfy our requests. There was so much room to think outside of the box so that was exactly what we did.</p>
<p>After we built some decks for us, and showing them to others, more and more riders asked us to build a deck for them too.   This was the time our teamrider Joel forced us to make it available for everyone. His ambitiousness and spirited impulses gave us the motivation to go that step. He told us he never want to ride another deck anymore. With your help we can make this dream happen.</p>
<p>Over 2 Years of engineering, calculating, prototyping, test riding, and searching for possible producers have passed until now. It have been 2 years of ups and downs and sometimes thinking about giving up. Especially finding a reliable and still affordable producer inside Europe was a hard challenge. But there went too much private money into this project to just give up centimeters before the goal!</p>
<p>That´s why now is the time we ask you to take a stand and be a part of the future of our sport!</p>
<p>Go ahead and choose one of the  perks, and help us to make our dreams happen or/and click the BACK IT button to help us with a donation! The sport can only get better with innovations! Choose one of the Deck bundles and get the chance to be one of the first ones to get your hands on one of of these beauties for a really discounted price or choose one of the limited merch articles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why Haero? You are asking? Because it will change your Riding for ever!</p>
<p>We believe we engineered the most innovative mountainboard deck ever. As passionate longboarders and snowboarders, we tried to implement as many features as possible from those sports into our deck design.</p>
<p>Find out what those features are and why we think they are important for your riding!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>You will get a one of a kind limited edition (50pcs.)  mountainboard deck with following benefits:  </p>
<p><strong><u>FLATCAVE / TAB</u> </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552245712/zhdgpzzqpgqucxzhda3w.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Concave seems to be new in mountainboarding but its not really, its more a revival!<br/>If you look at it closely you will see that different skate decks can have different types of concaves. While testing different concaves, we found out the <strong>""Flatcave"" </strong>is just right for us mountainboarders! The classic radial concave follows the arc of a mellow circle. The symetric <strong>""Flatcave""</strong> is a flat area with curved up edges. Creating a slightly more sharp edge than a radial concave. It will give you even more hold and response. Don't be afraid to ride that beast without heel straps!</p>
<p><u><strong>GAS PEDALS</strong></u></p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552245938/omikm31by3uyvtkmjhei.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>What's that? Like on my car? Yes, almost! We designed the deck profile and the<strong> ""Flatcave""</strong> so that they meet at a special point! Right were your big toe is! This will give you a perfect <strong>""Gas pedal""</strong> to steer your board with a sharp response. This will give you an immediate feedback from the truck. If you want to go around that corner really hard, just press on that <strong>""Gas pedal""</strong> and it will respond! There will be no delay because of missing torsional stiffness around the tip and tail or because your toe is hovering over empty space. This also works well because of the <strong>""Power X inside""</strong> construction we implemented. What's that? We will explain that construction in more detail below...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>WIDE FOODBED</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552246102/xeuiukenkgobrnqsc4nm.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>We designed the footbed of our mountainboard deck really wide to fit all footsizes. Why is that important?<br/>Because with too narrow a board your toe movement will not directly translate to truck movement. As described above, we designed our deck to have the perfect interaction between the <strong>""extra wide""</strong> shape, the <strong>""Gas pedals""</strong> and the <strong>""Power X inside"" </strong>(see below). If your deck is too narrow your foot travels through empty space before reaching the deck, which will cause a delayed response. That's not just inefficient but also uncomfortable. Step on a <strong>""Wide Footbed""</strong> deck and you'll feel way more comfortable and connected to your, deck.</p>

<p><u><strong>FLAT STAND ROCKER PROFILE</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552246239/jxkgl6wpnk6czivizbfb.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Every mountainboard deck currently on the market has a full camber design, which can lead to the rider's knees being over-stretched or pronationed! The natural stance of a human leg is to sit flat to the ground, that's why we designed our foot bed flat to the ground as well! That's why our boards have a mixed rocker profile with 2 <strong>""Flat Stand""</strong> Foot beds and a <strong>""Camber""</strong> between the legs.<br/>Try yourself and you'll feel the difference!<br/>Your meniscus will thank you...believe us!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>COIL CAMBER </strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552246383/v8rfvi7xe5endjhi598b.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Our deck's profile is a mix between the two <strong>""Flat Stand""</strong> foot beds and a distinct<strong> ""Camber"" </strong>between your feet.<br/>This short Camber will give you the power and pop between your legs that you always dreamed of ;)<br/>It feels like you have a coil spring between your feet </p>
<p> </p>
<p>RAIL LOCK SYSTEM<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552246552/dznxnlrht8el2adwanks.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Ever got caught up on a handrail with your chunky mountainboard wheels?<br/>Never again with the Haero <strong>""Rail Lock System""</strong>!<br/>The <strong>""Flat Stand""</strong> and the <strong>""Camber""</strong> between the legs perfectly mix up to our <strong>""Rail Lock System""</strong>. This is a point on the base of the deck where the board stops sliding diagonally before the wheels can touch the rail. So if you don't hit a rail 100% perfect, it will help you to still stick that slide!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>WIDE SLIDE SURFACE</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552246672/dd4clrdf8vvgwxhazkby.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>The Haero deck was designed to be really wide and almost 100% flat (no concave) in the middle to get the maximum stability while sliding on rails. You will find a small raised edge in the middle of the deck to prevent the deck from hang ups and other damages. But this will not affect the predictable and comfortable yet stiff flex and pop you get out of that<strong> ""Camber""</strong> in the middle. Read below how we managed to get a real stiff situation between tip and tail area but maintain a little softer flex between your legs!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>WHEELBASE &amp; STANCE OPTIONS</strong></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552246767/ajs4femzzz0nnonzpt2o.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>When in our engineering and testing phase, we have received lots of feedback about different riders' preferences about the specs of the deck. Therefore we decided to build a ""jack of all trades"" deck which can suit every rider's needs. The Haero Deck will have 2 different stance and wheelbase options to adjust for a rider's height and weight and to adjust the wheelbase for skatepark, freeride or big air riding. <br/>The stance is not just up to rider's size and personal preference. With the wide stance you are as close to your trucks as on any other deck on the market, which makes it the ultimate manual machine! The wheelbase will affect the overall riding. It changes the turning radius of the deck. A short deck will have a small radius, which makes it very maneuverable e.g. in the skatepark. A long wheelbase will give you a more stable ride e.g. important on a BX track or for downhill. Also for landing big tricks and flips, a longer wheelbase can be very helpful.<br/>We believe that we can achieve this versatility without having 2 different deck lengths. With the Haero deck, you'll get a one board quiver.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our construction including following features:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>DURABLE TOPSHEET</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552246917/ow3l75zzoahz1fk6vf3a.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Now let's talk about the construction of our decks.<br/>We believe a mountainboard should be put through its paces without compromises. Therefore durability is the most important aspect when it comes to designing a mountainboard. Thats why we decided to cover this baby as well as possible. The top of the deck will be covered with a snowboard style <strong>""Durable Topsheet""</strong>. This helps to protect it from wild flying rocks, skateboards or scooters that may damage the fibres or the wood. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>EASY SLIDE BASE</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552247355/fe2bqelc8muap40svs7u.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>You want to punish the base of that<br/>mountainboard too...go ahead!<br/>We designed our mountainboard deck to withstand all troubles with his snowboard style <strong>""Easy Slide Base""</strong>! Dont be fooled, this is not just a snowboard base glued to a mountianboard. It's specially designed to fit our needs! It's thinner and harder to keep it light, but yet remains very durable! A normal snowboard base is too heavy and too soft for mountainboarders to use. The <strong>""Easy Slide Base""</strong> prevents the fibres you have on the bottom of all mountainboard decks from being destroyed by stones or handrails. Your fibres can be damaged very quickly if you're a hard rider, which the fibres to lose their strength, leading to a loss in pop, stiffness and in the end maybe also to a broken deck.<br/>So leave your wax at home homies!<br/>You'll be covered. <br/><br/>Btw, the sliding base helps with sliding too as the name reveals. You can hit the rails with a way less entrance speed which make it really more comfortable and better for your confidence. Don't be afraid of hanging up anymore!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>ABS SIDEWALLS</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552249700/vm7zas5qsbkqunxj1rtz.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Allright, the top and base is safe, but what about the sides?<br/>Another Feature in terms of durability are our<br/><strong>""ABS Sidewalls""</strong>.<br/>In the process of testing our decks it sometimes got hit by wild flying scooters in the park or stones in the forest. Impacts like that can lead the glassfibres to break at that point and leave a gap where water can enter and destroy the woodcore or plywood. As wood is really sensitive to water, we decided to borrow another design from snowboarding. The<strong> ""ABS Sidewalls"" </strong>help to dampen the impacts which may occur and preserve the fibreglass and the woodcore.<br/>This makes it the perfect feature for an all round protected mountainboard deck!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>INSERTS</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552249841/mbn0on20zidoxj7tstlv.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Why? Because we wanted them back!<br/>We want to offer a clean base with no screwheads peaking through.<br/>Dont be affraid of showcasing any screws if you're about to strech out a sweet method!</p>

<p><u><strong>FEATHERLIGHT CORE</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552250036/l8qojlitrifm0ztvh2xs.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Let's come to the heart of<br/>every mountainboard... the core!<br/>Let's face the truth, mountainboards are ridiculously heavy!<br/>This issue with deck weight remains a problem today. So what material brings the most weight to a mountainboard deck? You wont believe it, but it's the resin! If you use plywood you need to glue it together with...""drum-roll""...resin! That's weight where we don't need weight! Wood itself gives you the best strength to weight ratio.<br/>If you don't have to cut it, don't cut it!<br/>Even though we have a crazy shape with a camber, 30° tip and tail and a concave which goes in a totally different direction, we found a way to produce our decks with only 3 sheets of wood...and maybe even one! Let's find out with our first factory made sample decks!<br/>We are aiming to <strong>save a minimum of 1/5 of the deck wight</strong> compared to other top range mountainboard decks currently on the market. <br/>If everything goes well we could even reduce the weight by 1/4</p>
<p><u><strong>CONSTRUCTION - OVERVIEW</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552250352/p0svvjmsrsagt3rsza9y.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>What else do we have inside the heart of our boards?<br/>As explained above, we have the <strong>""Durable Topsheet""</strong>, the <strong>""Easy Slide Base""</strong> and the <strong>""ABS Sidewalls""</strong> to cover the <strong>""Featherlight Core""</strong>. Without fibres and resin, a deck would be very flexy, unresponsive and wobbly when it comes to torsional stiffness. The best case for a mountainboard deck is to have ZERO torsional stiffnes! Because you want to have a direct feel and feedback. If you move your leg, you want to move the truck instantaneously and not bend the deck first! Also If you ride a deck which doesn't have a stiff torsion really fast, it will give you speed woobles from hell! You also don't want that, and that's why we are bagging the <strong>""Featherlight Core""</strong> with <strong>""Biaxial Fibreglass""</strong>. <br/>To prevent the deck from flexing too much and touching the ground while landing big jumps or drops, (and we´ve seen many decks doing just this) we need to cover it with <strong>""unidirectional fibres""</strong> too. <br/>Because fibreglass itself is really heavy, we use carbon for our next 2 features!<br/>The <strong>""Carbon Power Stripes""</strong> will give the deck his progressive stiff flex pattern and helps the <strong>""camber""</strong> to give you a nice pop!<br/>We want a stiff deck that is still comfortable enough to ride. You really don't want to ride a deck that is as stiff as a stone, because then your leg muscles and meniscus have to do all the work.<br/>So what's the deal with that <strong>""Power X inside""</strong> now?<br/>Check out the next box...</p>
<p><u><strong>POWER X</strong></u></p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552250427/qyvpisrhm0rjompfwiq9.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Okay, so we talked a lot about that feature before. What is the story behind it? If you use complete sheets of fibres from the tip to the tail of the deck, the flex and torional stiffness is the same everywhere on the deck. We want to have special conditions depending on the area. In our opinion, we want to have a stiff yet predictable flex between the legs and a ""stiff as possbile"" condition between our feet (the origin of power) and the truck (where the power should act)<br/>To reach that goal, we are using 2 carbon strips layed up in an X shape to stiffen up this area. This will give the deck a good unidirectional stiffness around tip and tail and a really good torsional stiffness for a maximum direct power supply from your foot to the truck. But we can still have a predictable flex pattern between the legs.</p>
<p><u><strong>THE WEDGE SYSTEM</strong></u><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552250599/f4heqtsutrga2x3y9yd2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>While engineering and testing our prototypes, we came up with so many specs where we firstly had to think about, how does it affect the riding if we change them. As described above, the <strong>""Wheelbase Options""</strong> affect the turning radius of your board. Also the truck angle is something we had to take into consideration. Again we did not want to compromise any of the specs. We want to offer you maximum <strong>adjustability</strong>! That's why we came up with the <strong>""Wedge System""</strong>. It's nothing more than a 5° wedge which you can use to change the truck angle to<br/>+5° or -5°.<br/>Correct me if i am wrong, but we think the mountainboard channel trucks are working really well between a<br/>25° and 35° deck angle.<br/>The steeper the angle, the more turny they will get, the mellower, the more stable they will get. We would suggest to go for 25° when you want to go faster than your angel can fly or you want to land big airs and to 35° if i wanna cruise your local skatepark. If you are looking for the allroundability we would go for 30° <br/><br/>All in all we believe we designed the most versatile mountainboard deck ever poduced. We wanted to open riders' minds to play around with their stance, with the wheelsbase and also the truck angle. While in the testing and prototype stage we did exactly that and experienced how big an effect that a change of a few centimeters or degrees can have on the feel of the ride! That's why we built in all those features to offer a mind openig shred tool.</p>

<h2>What we need</h2>
<p>With 6000€ funded we will be able to produce our limited edition bro model decks!</p>
<p>The first batch will be limited to 50 decks. So better be fast.</p>
<p>With the money we want to cover:</p>
<p>-The production of the decks</p>
<p>-The press mould</p>
<p>-The engineering and R&amp;D costs</p>
<p>-The content creation &amp; media design</p>
<p>-The shipping costs of the batch &amp; other expenses</p>
<p>If you help us to raise the money for our first serial production, you help us to make a change in the industry and let the sport grow into the right direction! Be the change now!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Future Goals</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>With a successful first factory made batch we want to establish on the market and work on even greater goals for the future!</p>
<ul>
<li>we want to be able to make our decks available for everyone beside our Indiegogo campaign. We want to distribute the decks to re sellers all around the globe</li>
<li>we want to ask all riders for their feedback and engineer a even better shape and construction</li>
<li>last but not least, our biggest goal would be to build a more ecological deck with the same good performance than our first batch. This is only possible if we are successful with our first state of art construction. We already have  great ideas and production methods to achieve that goal but first we need some money for the engineering </li>
<li>we want to be able to engineer a shorter deck too for kids, girls or smaller persons who are looking for a high quality and lightweight deck </li>
</ul>

After meeting Phil and seeing first hand his ambitious plans for HAERO Shred Tools, I genuinely cannot wait to see this project materialise and hope to see these decks underneath riders' feet very soon. The plan is for a high spec and versatile deck that should cater to anyone's mountainboarding needs; be it racing down a track, finding lines through a forest or dialing in tricks at the park. The most innovative touch is the durable top and bottom sheet, which should hugely increase the longevity of the deck and make boardslides way easier, even with small entrance speed.

We are two passionate Mountainboarders from Germany tirelessly waiting for a innovative and lightweight deck to appear on the market. There had been some good innovations in the past but there was always something that did not satisfy our requests. There was so much room to think outside of the box so that was exactly what we did.
After we built some decks for us, and showing them to others, more and more riders asked us to build a deck for them too.   This was the time our teamrider Joel forced us to make it available for everyone. His ambitiousness and spirited impulses gave us the motivation to go that step. He told us he never want to ride another deck anymore. With your help we can make this dream happen.
Over 2 Years of engineering, calculating, prototyping, test riding, and searching for possible producers have passed until now. It have been 2 years of ups and downs and sometimes thinking about giving up. Especially finding a reliable and still affordable producer inside Europe was a hard challenge. But there went too much private money into this project to just give up centimeters before the goal!
That´s why now is the time we ask you to take a stand and be a part of the future of our sport!
Go ahead and choose one of the  perks, and help us to make our dreams happen or/and click the BACK IT button to help us with a donation! The sport can only get better with innovations! Choose one of the Deck bundles and get the chance to be one of the first ones to get your hands on one of of these beauties for a really discounted price or choose one of the limited merch articles.
 
Why Haero? You are asking? Because it will change your Riding for ever!
We believe we engineered the most innovative mountainboard deck ever. As passionate longboarders and snowboarders, we tried to implement as many features as possible from those sports into our deck design.
Find out what those features are and why we think they are important for your riding!
 
What You Get
You will get a one of a kind limited edition (50pcs.)  mountainboard deck with following benefits:  
FLATCAVE / TAB 
Concave seems to be new in mountainboarding but its not really, its more a revival!If you look at it closely you will see that different skate decks can have different types of concaves. While testing different concaves, we found out the ""Flatcave"" is just right for us mountainboarders! The classic radial concave follows the arc of a mellow circle. The symetric ""Flatcave"" is a flat area with curved up edges. Creating a slightly more sharp edge than a radial concave. It will give you even more hold and response. Don't be afraid to ride that beast without heel straps!
GAS PEDALS
What's that? Like on my car? Yes, almost! We designed the deck profile and the ""Flatcave"" so that they meet at a special point! Right were your big toe is! This will give you a perfect ""Gas pedal"" to steer your board with a sharp response. This will give you an immediate feedback from the truck. If you want to go around that corner really hard, just press on that ""Gas pedal"" and it will respond! There will be no delay because of missing torsional stiffness around the tip and tail or because your toe is hovering over empty space. This also works well because of the ""Power X inside"" construction we implemented. What's that? We will explain that construction in more detail below...
 
WIDE FOODBEDWe designed the footbed of our mountainboard deck really wide to fit all footsizes. Why is that important?Because with too narrow a board your toe movement will not directly translate to truck movement. As described above, we designed our deck to have the perfect interaction between the ""extra wide"" shape, the ""Gas pedals"" and the ""Power X inside"" (see below). If your deck is too narrow your foot travels through empty space before reaching the deck, which will cause a delayed response. That's not just inefficient but also uncomfortable. Step on a ""Wide Footbed"" deck and you'll feel way more comfortable and connected to your, deck.
 
FLAT STAND ROCKER PROFILEEvery mountainboard deck currently on the market has a full camber design, which can lead to the rider's knees being over-stretched or pronationed! The natural stance of a human leg is to sit flat to the ground, that's why we designed our foot bed flat to the ground as well! That's why our boards have a mixed rocker profile with 2 ""Flat Stand"" Foot beds and a ""Camber"" between the legs.Try yourself and you'll feel the difference!Your meniscus will thank you...believe us!
 
COIL CAMBER Our deck's profile is a mix between the two ""Flat Stand"" foot beds and a distinct ""Camber"" between your feet.This short Camber will give you the power and pop between your legs that you always dreamed of ;)It feels like you have a coil spring between your feet 
 
RAIL LOCK SYSTEMEver got caught up on a handrail with your chunky mountainboard wheels?Never again with the Haero ""Rail Lock System""!The ""Flat Stand"" and the ""Camber"" between the legs perfectly mix up to our ""Rail Lock System"". This is a point on the base of the deck where the board stops sliding diagonally before the wheels can touch the rail. So if you don't hit a rail 100% perfect, it will help you to still stick that slide!
 
WIDE SLIDE SURFACEThe Haero deck was designed to be really wide and almost 100% flat (no concave) in the middle to get the maximum stability while sliding on rails. You will find a small raised edge in the middle of the deck to prevent the deck from hang ups and other damages. But this will not affect the predictable and comfortable yet stiff flex and pop you get out of that ""Camber"" in the middle. Read below how we managed to get a real stiff situation between tip and tail area but maintain a little softer flex between your legs!
 
WHEELBASE & STANCE OPTIONS
When in our engineering and testing phase, we have received lots of feedback about different riders' preferences about the specs of the deck. Therefore we decided to build a ""jack of all trades"" deck which can suit every rider's needs. The Haero Deck will have 2 different stance and wheelbase options to adjust for a rider's height and weight and to adjust the wheelbase for skatepark, freeride or big air riding. The stance is not just up to rider's size and personal preference. With the wide stance you are as close to your trucks as on any other deck on the market, which makes it the ultimate manual machine! The wheelbase will affect the overall riding. It changes the turning radius of the deck. A short deck will have a small radius, which makes it very maneuverable e.g. in the skatepark. A long wheelbase will give you a more stable ride e.g. important on a BX track or for downhill. Also for landing big tricks and flips, a longer wheelbase can be very helpful.We believe that we can achieve this versatility without having 2 different deck lengths. With the Haero deck, you'll get a one board quiver.
 
Our construction including following features:
 
DURABLE TOPSHEETNow let's talk about the construction of our decks.We believe a mountainboard should be put through its paces without compromises. Therefore durability is the most important aspect when it comes to designing a mountainboard. Thats why we decided to cover this baby as well as possible. The top of the deck will be covered with a snowboard style ""Durable Topsheet"". This helps to protect it from wild flying rocks, skateboards or scooters that may damage the fibres or the wood. 
 
EASY SLIDE BASEYou want to punish the base of thatmountainboard too...go ahead!We designed our mountainboard deck to withstand all troubles with his snowboard style ""Easy Slide Base""! Dont be fooled, this is not just a snowboard base glued to a mountianboard. It's specially designed to fit our needs! It's thinner and harder to keep it light, but yet remains very durable! A normal snowboard base is too heavy and too soft for mountainboarders to use. The ""Easy Slide Base"" prevents the fibres you have on the bottom of all mountainboard decks from being destroyed by stones or handrails. Your fibres can be damaged very quickly if you're a hard rider, which the fibres to lose their strength, leading to a loss in pop, stiffness and in the end maybe also to a broken deck.So leave your wax at home homies!You'll be covered. Btw, the sliding base helps with sliding too as the name reveals. You can hit the rails with a way less entrance speed which make it really more comfortable and better for your confidence. Don't be afraid of hanging up anymore!
 
ABS SIDEWALLSAllright, the top and base is safe, but what about the sides?Another Feature in terms of durability are our""ABS Sidewalls"".In the process of testing our decks it sometimes got hit by wild flying scooters in the park or stones in the forest. Impacts like that can lead the glassfibres to break at that point and leave a gap where water can enter and destroy the woodcore or plywood. As wood is really sensitive to water, we decided to borrow another design from snowboarding. The ""ABS Sidewalls"" help to dampen the impacts which may occur and preserve the fibreglass and the woodcore.This makes it the perfect feature for an all round protected mountainboard deck!
 
INSERTSWhy? Because we wanted them back!We want to offer a clean base with no screwheads peaking through.Dont be affraid of showcasing any screws if you're about to strech out a sweet method!

 
 
 
 
 
FEATHERLIGHT CORELet's come to the heart ofevery mountainboard... the core!Let's face the truth, mountainboards are ridiculously heavy!This issue with deck weight remains a problem today. So what material brings the most weight to a mountainboard deck? You wont believe it, but it's the resin! If you use plywood you need to glue it together with...""drum-roll""...resin! That's weight where we don't need weight! Wood itself gives you the best strength to weight ratio.If you don't have to cut it, don't cut it!Even though we have a crazy shape with a camber, 30° tip and tail and a concave which goes in a totally different direction, we found a way to produce our decks with only 3 sheets of wood...and maybe even one! Let's find out with our first factory made sample decks!We are aiming to save a minimum of 1/5 of the deck wight compared to other top range mountainboard decks currently on the market. If everything goes well we could even reduce the weight by 1/4
CONSTRUCTION - OVERVIEWWhat else do we have inside the heart of our boards?As explained above, we have the ""Durable Topsheet"", the ""Easy Slide Base"" and the ""ABS Sidewalls"" to cover the ""Featherlight Core"". Without fibres and resin, a deck would be very flexy, unresponsive and wobbly when it comes to torsional stiffness. The best case for a mountainboard deck is to have ZERO torsional stiffnes! Because you want to have a direct feel and feedback. If you move your leg, you want to move the truck instantaneously and not bend the deck first! Also If you ride a deck which doesn't have a stiff torsion really fast, it will give you speed woobles from hell! You also don't want that, and that's why we are bagging the ""Featherlight Core"" with ""Biaxial Fibreglass"". To prevent the deck from flexing too much and touching the ground while landing big jumps or drops, (and we´ve seen many decks doing just this) we need to cover it with ""unidirectional fibres"" too. Because fibreglass itself is really heavy, we use carbon for our next 2 features!The ""Carbon Power Stripes"" will give the deck his progressive stiff flex pattern and helps the ""camber"" to give you a nice pop!We want a stiff deck that is still comfortable enough to ride. You really don't want to ride a deck that is as stiff as a stone, because then your leg muscles and meniscus have to do all the work.So what's the deal with that ""Power X inside"" now?Check out the next box...
POWER X
Okay, so we talked a lot about that feature before. What is the story behind it? If you use complete sheets of fibres from the tip to the tail of the deck, the flex and torional stiffness is the same everywhere on the deck. We want to have special conditions depending on the area. In our opinion, we want to have a stiff yet predictable flex between the legs and a ""stiff as possbile"" condition between our feet (the origin of power) and the truck (where the power should act)To reach that goal, we are using 2 carbon strips layed up in an X shape to stiffen up this area. This will give the deck a good unidirectional stiffness around tip and tail and a really good torsional stiffness for a maximum direct power supply from your foot to the truck. But we can still have a predictable flex pattern between the legs.
THE WEDGE SYSTEMWhile engineering and testing our prototypes, we came up with so many specs where we firstly had to think about, how does it affect the riding if we change them. As described above, the ""Wheelbase Options"" affect the turning radius of your board. Also the truck angle is something we had to take into consideration. Again we did not want to compromise any of the specs. We want to offer you maximum adjustability! That's why we came up with the ""Wedge System"". It's nothing more than a 5° wedge which you can use to change the truck angle to+5° or -5°.Correct me if i am wrong, but we think the mountainboard channel trucks are working really well between a25° and 35° deck angle.The steeper the angle, the more turny they will get, the mellower, the more stable they will get. We would suggest to go for 25° when you want to go faster than your angel can fly or you want to land big airs and to 35° if i wanna cruise your local skatepark. If you are looking for the allroundability we would go for 30° All in all we believe we designed the most versatile mountainboard deck ever poduced. We wanted to open riders' minds to play around with their stance, with the wheelsbase and also the truck angle. While in the testing and prototype stage we did exactly that and experienced how big an effect that a change of a few centimeters or degrees can have on the feel of the ride! That's why we built in all those features to offer a mind openig shred tool.

So how will the deck look like?
As we only built handmade prototypes until now, we can only show you some shots of our prototypes and some possible finishes of our producer, as well as some examples of our graphic designer.
But we promise to build a deck which is as sexy as all our features!

What we need
With 6000€ funded we will be able to produce our limited edition bro model decks!
The first batch will be limited to 50 decks. So better be fast.
With the money we want to cover:
-The production of the decks
-The press mould
-The engineering and R&D costs
-The content creation & media design
-The shipping costs of the batch & other expenses
If you help us to raise the money for our first serial production, you help us to make a change in the industry and let the sport grow into the right direction! Be the change now!
 
Future Goals
 
With a successful first factory made batch we want to establish on the market and work on even greater goals for the future!

we want to be able to make our decks available for everyone beside our Indiegogo campaign. We want to distribute the decks to re sellers all around the globe
we want to ask all riders for their feedback and engineer a even better shape and construction
last but not least, our biggest goal would be to build a more ecological deck with the same good performance than our first batch. This is only possible if we are successful with our first state of art construction. We already have  great ideas and production methods to achieve that goal but first we need some money for the engineering 
we want to be able to engineer a shorter deck too for kids, girls or smaller persons who are looking for a high quality and lightweight deck

""This is the first deck I have ever felt comfortable without heel straps !""
JOEL T.  Brofessional Mountainboarder
""Hello guys, my Name is Giulio Bernadelli from Italy. I am a Freeride and Freestyle oriented Mountainboarder. Last year I had the opportunity to test the Haero Mountainboard deck in Freeride and on jumps. The construction is super tough and well made. My feet seats perfectly on the deck due to the concave that is there when you need it but not too big, so you still feel comfortable. Riding this deck all I can say feels stable, poppy and very light.""

 
 
 
 
 
 
GIULIO B. FREERIDE GOD
""After I snaped 3 Decks Phil and me decided to develop the Haero Bro Model Decks.Soo we made a deck exactly how we thought a MTB deck should be. And damn.. it got better than we ever wished for!Believe me guys that's the right Deck for Jibedajas like me but also for all you downhill chargersIn LoveSharkfin""

JOEL B. REAL JIBEDIAH
""It's always exciting to see something new happening in the world of mountainboarding. After meeting Phil and seeing first hand his ambitious plans for HAERO Shred Tools, I genuinely cannot wait to see this project materialise and hope to see these decks underneath riders' feet very soon. The plan is for a high spec and versatile deck that should cater to anyone's mountainboarding needs; be it racing down a track, finding lines through a forest or dialing in tricks at the park. The most innovative touch is the durable top and bottom sheet, which should hugely increase the longevity of the deck and make boardslides way easier, even with small entrance speed. Leave your wax at home! With support from a community of riders, we could see this small project transpire into a progressive product.""

ADAM C. CREATIVE JIB MASTER
""I dont know how they did this, but if you stand on this deck and ride it once or twice you dont want to step on an other Deck anymore! Cant wait for this deck to hit the market!""

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
<p>Welcome to the Hideaway at Heritage Hill!  My name is Carol, and along with my daughter Samantha, we are creating The Hideaway at Heritage Hill.  </p>
<p>In 2013, I traveled to Wales and<i> lived</i> in a Romany wagon for 2 years while I studied the art, restoration, and history of the 'travellers'.  When the time came to return to the States, it was no surprise that my baggage did<strong> <i>not</i> </strong>fit under the seat in front of me (2 suitcases, 1 carry-on ...and 3 wagons)! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561089826/zc06qz81p9mx7aqvkbdg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The two years spent within these cozy hideaways on wheels taught me so much more than I can possibly communicate in just a few lines, and because of all those special moments, I am committed to restoring, saving, and sharing the beauty of wagon life.</p>
<p>With my daughter's expertise in marketing and project management in the tourism and hospitality industry, and my knowledge and direct experience with the restoration process, we are a dynamic partnership for success.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Description of Business</b></p>
<p>The Hideaway at Heritage Hill is a small business that gives guests a unique opportunity designed to evoke a romantic experience of a by-gone era.  Our three Romany wagons reside on 5 acres of wildflowers and towering pines on Whidbey Island, WA.  Each wagon site includes a 'bender tent' for added space, if desired, and for larger groups, a traditional Cheyenne Tipi will accommodate 2-6 guests.  </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Meet our wagons</strong></h2>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561023577/xl7on7ztekvzgjijqock.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Currently, Evergreen is in need of her topcoat enamel paint (Brunswick green) before we can place the gold-leafed carvings on the sides, front and back.  Once the carvings are secure, the decorative painting can begin.  The inside features a double bed, a writing desk, sliding windows for cross-ventilation on hot summer days, and a tiny wood burning stove that will keep you warm on the coldest of winter nights. The photo below gives you a visual of a nicely restored Bowtop wagon.  </p>

<p>The Dolphin's namesake derives from the mythological carvings located on the front porch.  Back in the day, Showman wagons most likely travelled to county fairs and circuses.   Once inside, you will see the raised double bed in the back of the wagon, two small cushioned benches, a dresser, china hutch, and a traditional 'queenie' stove to take the chill off the evening air, and mollycroft windows for added height and moonlit nights.  Today, she will need a more uniformed, fresh topcoat of enamel to restore the wagon back to it's original state.  Below is an example of a restored Showman wagon (note the traditional continuation of color all the way from the front to the back).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561052646/xpboa70mnzfqpk6n1bwm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>For many years, this Preacher's Wagon was mistaken for a circus wagon -thus the vibrant contrasting colors!  In the late 1800's, the Church of England had commissioned less than 50 of these wagons to 'spread the word' -however, in 1914, most went to WWI and didn't return. Different from the Romany wagons, Sojourner has 2 rooms -the sitting room towards the front, and the bedroom with its doors that fully open to the outdoors.  The sitting room still has her Victorian cabinets, patterned arched glass windows, and a wood burning stove.  This extremely rare wagon now needs some structural repairs, a new roof, and a more traditional choice of paint for the topcoat in order to be restored back in harmony with its history.</p>

<p>When more space is needed, Stargazer, our North Cheyenne tipi can accommodate 2 to 6 guests.  In addition to our tipi, each Romany wagon will also include the use of a 'bender tent,' or belle tent (pictured below); each tent can sleep 2 people.  Comfortable mattresses are included in both the tipi and the tents.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>While Whidbey Island is known as a fantastic destination for both tourists and locals alike, there is an extreme shortage of mid-range accommodations.  It is hard to find a place to stay for less than $125 from spring through autumn, aside from a campground. The Hideaway is trying to fill this gap. For venues and individuals alike, all of our accommodations will ultimately provide a setting that appeals to ones sense of adventure, while still offering an inner retreat, a closeness to nature, and a sense of renewal and restoration at an affordable price.</p>

Who We Are
Welcome to the Hideaway at Heritage Hill!  My name is Carol, and along with my daughter Samantha, we are creating The Hideaway at Heritage Hill.  
In 2013, I traveled to Wales and lived in a Romany wagon for 2 years while I studied the art, restoration, and history of the 'travellers'.  When the time came to return to the States, it was no surprise that my baggage did not fit under the seat in front of me (2 suitcases, 1 carry-on ...and 3 wagons)! 

The two years spent within these cozy hideaways on wheels taught me so much more than I can possibly communicate in just a few lines, and because of all those special moments, I am committed to restoring, saving, and sharing the beauty of wagon life.
With my daughter's expertise in marketing and project management in the tourism and hospitality industry, and my knowledge and direct experience with the restoration process, we are a dynamic partnership for success.
Description of Business
The Hideaway at Heritage Hill is a small business that gives guests a unique opportunity designed to evoke a romantic experience of a by-gone era.  Our three Romany wagons reside on 5 acres of wildflowers and towering pines on Whidbey Island, WA.  Each wagon site includes a 'bender tent' for added space, if desired, and for larger groups, a traditional Cheyenne Tipi will accommodate 2-6 guests.  
Meet our wagons
""Evergreen""

Currently, Evergreen is in need of her topcoat enamel paint (Brunswick green) before we can place the gold-leafed carvings on the sides, front and back.  Once the carvings are secure, the decorative painting can begin.  The inside features a double bed, a writing desk, sliding windows for cross-ventilation on hot summer days, and a tiny wood burning stove that will keep you warm on the coldest of winter nights. The photo below gives you a visual of a nicely restored Bowtop wagon.  
 
 
""The Dolphin""
 
The Dolphin's namesake derives from the mythological carvings located on the front porch.  Back in the day, Showman wagons most likely travelled to county fairs and circuses.   Once inside, you will see the raised double bed in the back of the wagon, two small cushioned benches, a dresser, china hutch, and a traditional 'queenie' stove to take the chill off the evening air, and mollycroft windows for added height and moonlit nights.  Today, she will need a more uniformed, fresh topcoat of enamel to restore the wagon back to it's original state.  Below is an example of a restored Showman wagon (note the traditional continuation of color all the way from the front to the back).

 
""Sojourner""

For many years, this Preacher's Wagon was mistaken for a circus wagon -thus the vibrant contrasting colors!  In the late 1800's, the Church of England had commissioned less than 50 of these wagons to 'spread the word' -however, in 1914, most went to WWI and didn't return. Different from the Romany wagons, Sojourner has 2 rooms -the sitting room towards the front, and the bedroom with its doors that fully open to the outdoors.  The sitting room still has her Victorian cabinets, patterned arched glass windows, and a wood burning stove.  This extremely rare wagon now needs some structural repairs, a new roof, and a more traditional choice of paint for the topcoat in order to be restored back in harmony with its history.
(Below: For group events, we have...)
""Stargazer""


When more space is needed, Stargazer, our North Cheyenne tipi can accommodate 2 to 6 guests.  In addition to our tipi, each Romany wagon will also include the use of a 'bender tent,' or belle tent (pictured below); each tent can sleep 2 people.  Comfortable mattresses are included in both the tipi and the tents.

 
The Ask
Your contributions, no matter how large or small, 
will make all the difference in the world to us. 
Our financial stumbling blocks lie in terms of materials, and outsourcing professional help for the structural restorations and fundamental infrastructural work needed to prepare the land and host guests. We've broken down our project into 2 separate phases.  This campaign is aimed to finance the costs of Phase 1 only.  If we exceed our crowdfunding goal, we will begin Phase 2 of our overall plan (described below).  
 Phase 1
All funds will go directly into these three categories: 
(a complete breakdown of costs is available by email request)

Restoration materials for the Dolphin and Evergreen: body paint, brushes, decorative enamel paint, gold leafing, and mattresses.  Evergreen needs window frames, window glass, a wood stove and installation.
Restoration Subtotal = $10,156.00

Infrastructure development of wagons sites and public use areas: leveling and grading the land for each site, one bath house [2 composting toilets and a shower], one covered cooking shelter, and sets of wagons stairs.
Infrastructure Subtotal: $7,670.00
TOTAL AMOUNT NEEDED: $17,826.00
Every contribution will go to offsetting the costs above; if we do not reach our goal, the project still moves forward...just painfully slow.
Phase 2
Should we exceed our goals from phase 1, we will excitedly move forward with phase 2, which will include: the restoration of our third wagon, Sojourner (in need of the most structural work), plus, the construction of a rustic, Pacific Northwest spa; complete with a wood-fired sauna, soaking tub, and an adjoining small tea house/relaxation room.
Prototype Spa:


What's In It For You?
While Whidbey Island is known as a fantastic destination for both tourists and locals alike, there is an extreme shortage of mid-range accommodations.  It is hard to find a place to stay for less than $125 from spring through autumn, aside from a campground. The Hideaway is trying to fill this gap. For venues and individuals alike, all of our accommodations will ultimately provide a setting that appeals to ones sense of adventure, while still offering an inner retreat, a closeness to nature, and a sense of renewal and restoration at an affordable price.

Your Perks
Perks are evenly split into options for both onsite and remote experiences to meet the needs of those who both plan on visiting in person, and those who can't.  However, in the spirit of collaboration, should you have another idea that might ""perk"" your interest, please let us know by emailing us at HideawayAtHeritageHill@gmail.com. 
Project Challenges
Our biggest challenge so far has been to acquire workers who are knowledgeable in wagon restoration. We have resolved this issue, oddly enough, by networking with wooden boat builders.  Now it is about securing the finances to move forward with their expertise.

What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?
We are 100% committed to making this a reality, and we will continue moving forward piece by piece with whatever funds we do collect. With determination and a clear goal in mind, we'll continue to raise funds however necessary until our reality is a reflection of our vision.
Everyone Can Help!
We appreciate that not everyone is in a position to contribute financially to the campaign, but if you are reading this, you can help!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get...</h3>
<p>Our funding goal is set to allow for the drawing up of legal documents &amp; two factory visits, enabling full manufacturing to commence and goods to be checked before shipping.</p>
<p>We have also factored in the tooling costs to help ensure that your Mi-Camp ONE is produced to a high standard replicating the concept images &amp; providing you with a well made tent, providing you with many seasons of enjoyment. </p>
<p>A minimum order quantity is also required for manufacturing, however we are hoping the Mi-Camp ONE's reward popularity will take us past the minimum order amount required.</p>
<p>If however the campaign isn't as popular as we hope and we don't reach the minimum order quantity required, additional factory visits maybe be required to renegotiate minimum order amounts. We also have the fall back of an additional round of funding at the start of the new season, as the demand for camping equipment is highly seasonal. </p>
<p><strong>However choosing to back the Mi-Camp ONE now means you'll have your tent in plenty of time for next season. </strong></p>
<p>We've complied a range of rewards for backing the Mi-Camp ONE including limited offers &amp; early bird discounts, through to great bundle deals that give you everything you need to customise your Mi-Camp ONE to your exact requirements.</p>
<p>If you dont see a perk that meets your requirements, just let me know and I'll customise one for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FAQ's</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q. How do they cope in the wind?</strong></p>
<p>A. Air frames are far more giving than traditional poles, allowing them to remain stable in the wind. The Mi-Camp ONE has pegging points around the base to secure it to the ground. It's also provided with guy ropes &amp; storm straps for extra stability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. How do they attach as a caravan / motor home awning?</strong></p>
<p>A. As the sides of the tent are flat, you can simply pull the tent up close to your vehicle / caravan and use the built in connectivity to attach together if desired.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. What happens if I get a puncture?</strong></p>
<p>A. The cells are double wrapped in a robust material to prevent puncture. However if it does happen, each cell automatically isolates preventing the whole tent going down. The repair patch can be applied or the cell replaced and re-inflated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. Does each tent come in its own bag?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes, each tent can be transported separately so you can take just what you need.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. How do you attach the pump.</strong></p>
<p>A. The pump attaches to the inflation valve in a similar way to an air mattress. However the pump nozzle locks in place to prevent air escaping whilst the tent is inflated.</p>
<p>The one way valve prevents air from escaping once the pump is disconnected. </p>
<p>To deflate the tent simply unscrew the valve cap and press the deflate button.</p>

FAQ's
Q. How do they cope in the wind?
A. Air frames are far more giving than traditional poles, allowing them to remain stable in the wind. The Mi-Camp ONE has pegging points around the base to secure it to the ground. It's also provided with guy ropes & storm straps for extra stability.
 
Q. How do they attach as a caravan / motor home awning?
A. As the sides of the tent are flat, you can simply pull the tent up close to your vehicle / caravan and use the built in connectivity to attach together if desired.
 
Q. What happens if I get a puncture?
A. The cells are double wrapped in a robust material to prevent puncture. However if it does happen, each cell automatically isolates preventing the whole tent going down. The repair patch can be applied or the cell replaced and re-inflated.
 
Q. Does each tent come in its own bag?
A. Yes, each tent can be transported separately so you can take just what you need.
 
Q. How do you attach the pump.
A. The pump attaches to the inflation valve in a similar way to an air mattress. However the pump nozzle locks in place to prevent air escaping whilst the tent is inflated.
The one way valve prevents air from escaping once the pump is disconnected. 
To deflate the tent simply unscrew the valve cap and press the deflate button.

<h3>The Family Nexus App</h3>
<p>The Family Nexus combines the power of mobile technology with the world's largest online family tree to automatically map the locations of events  in your ancestor's lives. We bring this awesomeness to our users by employing a ""freemium"" model (see below). The app goes beyond just birth locations, and also maps marriage, residence, death, burial, and other locations as well.</p>
<p>The app goes way beyond just displaying these locations on a map. The app sends notifications to your phone when you get close to the locations of events in your family history.</p>

The Family Nexus app showed her which ancestors lived where, including some ancestors she wasn't aware of. She was able to customize her itinerary to visit the towns and villages where her ancestors lived and worked. The app greatly enriched her overall travel experience.</p>
<p>But you don't have to travel overseas to benefit from this incredible family history app.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DAILY ALERTS</strong></p>
<p>In addition to notifications based on your location, you also get alerts on the anniversaries of births, marriages, and deaths. This simple reminder keeps you engaged with your family history and invites you to take a few minutes to learn about a different ancestor everyday!</p>
<p>One user has said, ""I appreciate the way this app makes me more interested and excited about family history."" This kind of feedback really keeps us motivated to continue bringing great new features to our app so people of all skill levels can get excited about their own family history.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS FREEMIUM?</strong></p>
<p>Freemium is a very common business model for mobile apps today. In essence, some features are made available for free and others can be unlocked by paying for them. We have a very simple model. The Family Nexus app offers great free features to all users. In addition, Premium Subscribers can unlock ALL the other cool features. We feel this subscription approach is much better than ""nickel and diming"" you for each feature. Also, subscribers get access to all new premium features as they are developed!</p>

<ul>
<li>Integration with FamilySearch to download 6 generations of your family tree</li>
<li>Automatically map birth, marriage, death, and burial locations</li>
<li>Display person details with key life events</li>
<li>Alerts to your phone when you are near the location of an ancestral event</li>

</ul>

<ul>
<li>Additional data beyond the 6 generations</li>
<li>Check-in to an ancestral location, and keep track of the places you have visited</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We greatly appreciate each one of our backers; we couldn't do it without you! Our goal is to make family history more accessible to people of all ages and skill levels. I believe that by using the power of mobile technology we can help people feel connected to their past in ways not seen before.</p>
<p>This project and this campaign is about more than just adding a new platform or new features. It is about expanding the reach of an industry-changing application. With your help we can bring the power of special places to the world.</p>
<p>If you have ever visited the centuries-old church where your ancestors were married, walked through a field they farmed, or reverently stood at the headstone of an ancestor, you know the power of special places. Visiting places that were significant in the lives of your ancestors can be a deeply moving experience. It helps you visualize their lives and connect with them in ways not possible any other way. Sharing that experience with loved ones deepens your bond with your living family members as well.</p>

<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p>If we exceed our initial funding goal of $25,000 we will be able to add cool new features to the app. What's more, we will add these features to the Android platform first!</p>
<h3>Stretch Goal #1: $35,000 - Geocode Photos!</h3>
<p>If we reach $35,000 we will add the ability to geocode rich media such as photographs and audio files within the app. This means you will be able to identify they precise GPS coordinates where a photo was taken and add that to your map. This feature will work on photos that are added to FamilySearch Memories, OR you can upload them directly from your device.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goal #2: $50,000 - Travel Planner!</h3>
<p>If we reach a total of $50,000 we will add new features to create custom travel itineraries in The Family Nexus app. Each itinerary can have up to 25 points of interest, and each location can be added to an itinerary quickly by tapping on it.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goal #3: $75,000 - Augmented Reality!</h3>
<p>If we reach $75,000 in funding we will create an augmented reality experience within the app! Imagine recording your thoughts and feelings while visiting your ancestor's grave or homestead. Then you publish your virtual memorial for others to access when they are at that location, too! Or view historic photos of the church where your grandparents were married simply by holding up the phone while visiting that location.</p>
<p>This will change family history forever!</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>If you want to support our campaign, but just can't afford to contribute financially at this time you can still help!</p>
<p>Crowdfunding works by expanding beyond the network of people that I, as the founder, know personally. We need everyone to get the word out about The Family Nexus app and about our funding campaign on Indiegogo!</p>
<ul>
<li>So tell EVERYONE you know about this! Let's make some noise!</li>

When we hit our funding goal we will have all the funds we need to meet our budget!</p><p>This means our risk is very low. A lot of the risks and challenges have already been resolved. For example, we have already completed the hard work of becoming a Certified FamilySearch Partner and learning how to use the family tree data that is critical to the app's success. In addition, we have laid the technical groundwork so that the app will work equally well on Android as it does on iOS.</p><p>As with any software development, the biggest risk is not delivering on time. However, our experience with this team of developers gives us confidence that this won't be an issue.

Crowdfunding works by expanding beyond the network of people that I, as the founder, know personally. We need everyone to get the word out about The Family Nexus app and about our funding campaign on Indiegogo!

So tell EVERYONE you know about this! Let's make some noise!

About MeI am a family history enthusiast, but I remember keenly the struggles and frustrations of learning to do research. I also recognize that not everyone wants to do research! That doesn't mean they aren't interested in their family history, however.I spent 15 years in a technology consulting business helping organizations improve their processes. I am a certified Project Manager, and I love to deliver solutions that solve problems and make life easier for people.I am currently a Senior Product Manager responsible for the online catalog (including digital resources) for a large archival institution with significant special collections of interest to researchers.My work with The Family Nexus is a personal passion and a labor of love. I am thrilled to apply my experience to create a product that enables people to connect with their family history!Project RisksMobile software development can be a risky and an expensive proposition. We have already successfully developed and launched The Family Nexus app for iPhone and iPad. In the process we learned a lot, and we have contracted with a team of trusted developers who understand our product and the needs of our customers.Our current project is to bring the same functionality to the Android platform. I have a fixed bid contract with seasoned and expert Android developers in the same company that helped us develop the app for iOS.In addition, we have secured an outside investor who has pledged to fund all but the $25,000 we are raising through this campaign towards the Android development. When we hit our funding goal we will have all the funds we need to meet our budget!This means our risk is very low. A lot of the risks and challenges have already been resolved. For example, we have already completed the hard work of becoming a Certified FamilySearch Partner and learning how to use the family tree data that is critical to the app's success. In addition, we have laid the technical groundwork so that the app will work equally well on Android as it does on iOS.As with any software development, the biggest risk is not delivering on time. However, our experience with this team of developers gives us confidence that this won't be an issue. Beyond getting the same functionality on Android as we have in iOS we have some stretch goals that may present some technical challenges. If we reach our stretch goals we will develop them for Android FIRST!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello Indiegogo community! First, let's introduce ourselves to you. We are TUPLUS, a creative and award-winning luggage design team based in Shanghai and Dallas.</p>
<p>Today most of the luggage in market look similar and work similar. People even confuse their luggage with others at the luggage claim. Therefore we gathered top designers from luxury goods industry and engineering industry and established TUPLUS in 2015. Our design philosophy is to build the coolest and most reliable luggage with unbeatable design and innovation.   </p>
<p>Our first generation product is the jaw-dropping TUPLUS X series aluminum carry-on which won <i>the Red Dot Product Design Award</i> and <i>the International Travel Goods Show Innovation Award!</i> People were shocked by every detail of TUPLUS design on that piece! <strong>Now, in order to better satisfy your travel needs, we are introducing you our 24'' hardside checked luggage, TUPLUS LINE!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Unique and simple symmetry design</h3>
<p>TUPLUS LINE is featured with a precise symmetry design which provides it with identical front and back sides. It's simple, either way.</p>

<h3>Made from ABS &amp; PC plastic materials with injection modeling technique</h3>
<p>Unlike most of the luggage in market, the entire case of LINE was built with injection modeling technique which is more costly but creates a stylish and harder shell. Besides, the precise case design and the best ABS &amp; PC materials we used add excellent durability to this sleek piece.</p>

<h3>Innovative and practical product designs</h3>
<p>Except for reliability, we also want to make sure the luggage in your hand is one of a kind and eye-catching. Both the pop-up extra wide pull rod and the ingenious sliding lock mechanism were created by TUPLUS. You only need to press the handle button to pop out the handle when you are about to start your journey. It cannot be easier to open or close your luggage by just sliding the lock with your finger. Four built-in mechanic hooks will hold the case tightly and seamlessly.</p>

We wanted to create goggles that overcome the limitations of a mask: that don't require to be equalized, are more hydrodynamic and will let you dive deep and with ease.<br/> <br/>Hektometer goggles allow you to save up lots of air, without having to give up the comfort and clear visibility of a mask.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>How do Hektometer goggles work:</h3><p> </p><p>The principle is quite simple: as you descend the silicone membrane placed on the inside of the frame will move towards your eyes, decreasing the volume of the airspace within the goggles. Simultaneously, water will flow through a small hole into the space between the frame and the membrane. On return to the surface the mechanism inverts and the water will flow out again.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/26DNekxYjURYfLuhO/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Advantages of Hektometer goggles</h3><p><br/><strong>1. you won’t have to equalize the mask* any more</strong> - its automatic!</p><p><strong>2. you will be able to concentrate on the equalization of your ears</strong> - mouthfill becomes easy!</p><p><strong>3. by using a noseclip you will be able to equalize hands-free</strong> - the dream of every freediver!</p><p><strong>4. you will be more hydrodynamic</strong> - Hektometer goggles create almost no resistance compared to a mask.

Thanks to the Hektometer goggles it will become even easier. We recommend it to any depth, even for shallow dives and to absolute beginners.<br/>…and it is the best way to take care of your ears!</p><p><strong>11. bearded freedivers will not be annoyed any more by water entering the mask</strong></p><p>* in traditional diving you have to equalize the mask while descending, i.e. you have to exhale air into your mask in order to avoid the phenomenon known as mask squeeze, and the subsequent injuring of your eyes. Hektometer goggles avoid all of this with a simple automatic equalizing system.</p><div>

Therefore, visibility with Hektometers is much better than with fluid goggles. Hektometers have a wide angle of view, while fluid goggles allow only a narrow cone of vision.<br/>Fluid goggles are intended to be used by experienced freedivers, while Hektometers are for all freedivers, experienced and beginners.</p><p><strong>Q: What is the difference between a freediving mask and Hektometer goggles?</strong></p><p>A: A freediving mask has a bigger air volume which has to be constantly equalized by exhaling air through the nose. Consequently, a mask always has to cover the nose preventing you from using a noseclip. In order to equalize the ears you will have to pinch your nose from time to time. With a mask, mouthfill equalization is difficult and only partially possible.<br/>In contrast Hektometer goggles equalize themselves. They do not cover the nose enabling you to use a noseclip. Mouthfill equalization becomes easy.</p><p><strong>Q: How deep can I go with Hektometer goggles?</strong></p><p>A: Until now Hektometers were used up to 100 meters / 330 feet (update 11/03/2018:  105.5 meters / 345 feet) by Davide Carrera, reporting still good visibility at such depths. He intends to use them in the near future below 100 meters.<br/>Despite this depth achievements, as every eye cavity is different, we recommend to use them very consciously below 40 meters / 130 feet. If you should experience significant negative pressure at any depth, do not go deeper!<br/>(note: regarding the risk of eye barotrauma we made dry experiments sucking out all of the air through a small hole in the lens in order to simulate unlimited depth. The result was that at a certain point the lens got very closed to the eye and visibility started to be reduced. Going on with air extraction at some point the test subjects instinctively closed their eyelids. The membrane and the eyelids filled up all the remaining space behind the lens, a bit like an octopus in a bottle. In case of the test subjects a barotrauma seemed to be impossible. Nevertheless, as every eye cavity is different, we cannot guarantee this. We recommend to proceed carefully at depth as these tests might not be valid for each and every eye cavity, especially skinny and deep ones.)</p><p><strong>Q: How good is visibility with Hektometer goggles?</strong></p><p>A: Visibility is the same or better than with a mask as Hektometer goggles have high quality lenses in acrylic glass. However it is essential to clean the lenses for good visibility.</p><p><strong>Q: How do Hektometers feel at depth?</strong></p><p>A: Up to around 30 meters / 100 feet you will almost not notice them. Below that you might feel the air space decreasing more and more.</p><p><strong>Q: The lenses look small. How wide is the angle of vision with Hektometer goggles?</strong></p><p>A: As the lenses are very close to your eyes the angle of vision is wider than that of a mask, a bit like contact lenses in comparison to glasses. Depending on the depth of your eye cavity the angle of vision might be even unlimited (as in the case of contact lenses).</p><p><strong>Q: Is it difficult to switch from a mask to Hektometer goggles?</strong></p><p>A: You just have to take your time to get used to them and you will benefit of their advantages. Some improved their personal bests on the first trial, some needed half a day to get used to the new sensations.</p><p><strong>Q: Where can I try Hektometer goggles?</strong></p><p>A: Right now you can try them in Italy, at Y-40, the world’s deepest pool in the world (<a href=""http://www.y-40.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.y-40.com</a>, Marco Mardollo), in Egypt, at dahab freedivers (<a href=""http://www.dahabfreedivers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dahabfreedivers.com</a>, Miguel Lozano) and in Spain, at Apnea Canarias (<a href=""http://www.apneacanarias.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.apneacanarias.com</a>, Miguel Lozano). More places are intended to follow.</p><p><strong>Q: Are Hektometer goggles suitable for spearfishing?</strong></p><p>A: Of course, especially for deep spearfishing. Vision is the same or better than with a mask. In addition to the already mentioned advantages, unlike a mask, they never create air bubbles which might disturb the fish.</p><p><strong>Q: How resistant are the goggles?</strong></p><p>A: The lenses are very fragile! We do not recommend to press on them as they could pop out and the membrane might get damaged. Otherwise the goggles have a good resistance.</p><p><strong>Q: Are the lenses scratch resistant?</strong></p><p>A: No. You should keep them always protected from any sharp objects. Best is to keep them in their box when not in use.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I unmount the lenses?</strong></p><p>A: Essentially not. It is very difficult to remount the lenses, and in addition the probability to damage the membrane is very high.</p><p>However in case it happened here is a video that shows how to remount the lenses: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98B5FKAK1Z0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98B5FKAK1Z0</a></p><p><strong>Q: How can I prevent fogging of Hektometer goggles?</strong></p><p>A: We recommend to spit saliva on the clean and dry (!) lenses and distribute it carefully with a finger trying not to touch the lens. Then rinse the goggles shortly in sea or sweet water.<br/>This “saliva coating” will last for an entire day if not washed out while taking off the goggles or if dried by the sun.</p><p>If during a dive session you have accidentally washed the “saliva coating” away, you can simply lick the lens with your tongue, although this method does not work as good as the dry application above.<br/>Fingerprints or grease on the lens are always a problem for adhesion of any anti fog.<br/>Therefore after diving always wash the lens with hot water and a dishwashing soap. This will be beneficial for better vision as well as for adhesion of the “saliva coating”.</p><p>As the distance between the eye and the lens is very small, we do not recommend commercial anti fog solutions as they might irritate your eyes.</p><p><strong>Q: Do you plan to apply a permanent anti fog coating in the future?</strong></p><p>A: We evaluated different anti fog coatings with a negative result, especially because they resulted not to be permanent. If somebody knows about a permanent solution we would be more than happy to apply it in future versions of the goggles.</p><p><strong>Q: What is mouthfill equalization?</strong></p><p>A: Mouthfill equalization is a method to equalize the ears when descending. Basically, you fill your mouth with air and exert a slight pressure on the Eustachian tubes in order to keep them open.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I have to be an advanced freediver for mouthfill equalization?</strong></p><p>A: Absolutely not. We managed to teach mouthfill in a few minutes to absolute beginners. On the contrary, for experienced freedivers it may be more difficult to learn, as they will have to get used to a different feeling.</p><p><strong>Q: How do I make mouthfill equalization?</strong></p><p>A: See explanation below. We are planning to post an instructional video in the future. Follow our youtube channel.</p><p><strong>Q: When and how was the idea for Hektometer goggles born?</strong></p><p>A: The idea was born in 2010 during a master class with William Trubridge (CNF world record holder, 102 m). In this discipline (Constant weight No Fins) it is especially annoying having to use your hands in order to equalize your ears. Years with many failing prototypes followed, until in 2016 a relatively simple version started to work.</p><p><strong>Q: Are Hektometer goggles protected by a patent?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, the principle of membrane goggles is protected by several international patents.</p><p><strong>Q: What makes the Hektometer noseclip so special?</strong></p><p>A: It is designed to be hydrodynamic, lightweight and comfortable.<br/>According to some freedivers, it is the best noseclip out there.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Shipping, taxes, etc</h3><p><strong>Q: How much is shipping?</strong></p><p>A: Shipping to<br/>Europe                       11 euro<br/>Rest of the world   16 euro</p><p>All shipping is insured and can be followed by a tracking number.</p><p>In alternative you can also pass by personally and<br/>visit us in the beautiful historic center of Naples, Italy.<br/>If you want to do so choose “Antarctica” as the country to ship.<br/>Note: Of course we do not ship to Antarctica :-) It is just a workaround in order not to charge shipping.</p><p><strong>Q: How much is shipping for several items?</strong></p><p>A: You pay only one shipment. On your additional items please choose “Antarctica” as the country to ship in order not to be charged for shipping.<br/>Note: Of course we do not ship to Antarctica :-) It is just a workaround in order not to charge shipping.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I change my shipping address after I have paid?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, you can.

<br/>Risks</h3><p><strong>Q: Is there a risk that you will not manage to deliver?</strong></p><p>A: No. Differently to many other crowdfunding projects, we are already through the prototype and testing phase, the final mold has been made and production of 800 pairs is completed.</p><p> </p><h3>

We wanted to create goggles that overcome the limitations of a mask: that don't require to be equalized, are more hydrodynamic and will let you dive deep and with ease. Hektometer goggles allow you to save up lots of air, without having to give up the comfort and clear visibility of a mask.  How do Hektometer goggles work: The principle is quite simple: as you descend the silicone membrane placed on the inside of the frame will move towards your eyes, decreasing the volume of the airspace within the goggles. Simultaneously, water will flow through a small hole into the space between the frame and the membrane. On return to the surface the mechanism inverts and the water will flow out again.  Advantages of Hektometer goggles1. you won’t have to equalize the mask* any more - its automatic!2. you will be able to concentrate on the equalization of your ears - mouthfill becomes easy!3. by using a noseclip you will be able to equalize hands-free - the dream of every freediver!4. you will be more hydrodynamic - Hektometer goggles create almost no resistance compared to a mask. More importantly, you will gain in efficiency from a streamlined position of your arms due to hands-free equalization5. you will need less weight - as you won’t have to carry unnecessary air in your lungs, just for equalizing the mask6. with the same amount of air you will be able to dive deeper - as all the air will be available for equalizing your ears properly7. you will be able to dive longeras you can use the total air you inhale at surface8. you will be more relaxedas there will be one less problem for you to worry about on your journey9. equalization will get easierbecause you can equalize more often with less force (frenzel technique)10. mouthfill equalization will become a piece of cake!mouthfill is the ultimate way to equalize! Thanks to the Hektometer goggles it will become even easier. We recommend it to any depth, even for shallow dives and to absolute beginners.…and it is the best way to take care of your ears!11. bearded freedivers will not be annoyed any more by water entering the mask* in traditional diving you have to equalize the mask while descending, i.e. you have to exhale air into your mask in order to avoid the phenomenon known as mask squeeze, and the subsequent injuring of your eyes. Hektometer goggles avoid all of this with a simple automatic equalizing system.

Comparison of Hektometer goggles   Design of Hektometer goggles in white (transparent) or in black 
 in detail:Freediving mask versus Hektometer goggles- Comparison of required air volume On an 80 meters dive with a low volume mask you need to take 1170 ccm of air at the surface (130 ccm in the mask + 1040 ccm in your lungs) just for equalizing the mask. This air has to be transferred entirely to the mask and will be compressed at depth (= 9 ATM) to 130 ccm.With Hektometer goggles instead you start with 32 ccm, that will be reduced to 3,6 ccm at 80 m.You can use all the air in your lungs for a longer and/or deeper dive.  Even on a 30 meters dive with a low volume mask you need to take 520 ccm of air at the surface (130 ccm in the mask + 390 ccm in your lungs) just for equalizing the mask. This air has to be transferred entirely to the mask and will be compressed at depth (= 4 ATM) to 130 ccm.With Hektometer goggles instead you start with 32 ccm, that will be reduced to 8 ccm at 30 m.Again, you can use all the air in your lungs for a longer and/or deeper dive.  included: Hektometer Noseclip The Hektometer noseclip is designed to be hydrodynamic, lightweight and comfortable.With little force it closes and blocks the nostrils in order to allow either mouthfill or Frenzel equalization.It is always included and comes with a neck lace.

<p>We are two Ecuadorian climbers:</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Castillo:</strong> I been climbing for 12 years. I started competing indoors with the Ecuadorian Climbing Federation but I realized that my passion was to climb outdoors. I love traveling for climbing. I have experience climbing and competing in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile and Cuba. Climbing is my way of life; I always have climbing projects in mind and I like to challenge myself physically and mentally.</p>
<p>This is the first project of the kind, so I want to promote and support climbing in my own country.</p>
<p><strong>Mafer Cevallos:</strong> I started climbing 15 years ago but in the last 7 years, climbing has become my way of life. I travel to climb and climb to live. I have experience climbing in Colombia and the US where I have done 3 road trips from Tahoe CA to Denver CO. I love climbing internationally but now it’s time to promote climbing in my home country. Currently, I am empower to teach climbing for women and I am proud and excited to have this project.</p>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong></p>
<p>•Ecuador has open and develop new areas of climbing but they are underuse</p>
<p>•Expand climbing community nationally and internationally</p>
<p>•Promote community based tourism</p>
<p>•Ecuador is still a chauvinist society that needs programs to empower women.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We are going to create a Big Audiovisual Project which means. We are going to have several people filming the roc trip for a month. We also have the expenses of the trip and logistics,women's clinic events,etc.Therefore, we need funding for it $40.000</li>
<li>We are going to show the episodes in youtube with a backup bitacora of the places. A final documentary will be also presented.</li>
<li>This is an adventure trip where in each episode, we will show you : where to go, where to stay, what routes are available,and communities that surround them, etc. The idea is that people that travel to Ecuador are going to have all the necessary information about places to climb,camp or visit. </li>
<li>People that help us raise money will get amazing gifts such as: T-shirts, stickers,rock climbing courses, rock climbing and mountaineering trips, homestay opportunities, Ecuador tourism advise, diverse souvenirs from Ecuador,advertisment. </li>
<li>
<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> We are going to reach our entire goal one way or another because  we believe in it and </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>this is one of the kind projects in Ecuador </span>

</div><p> </p></div>","We are two Ecuadorian climbers:
Andrea Castillo: I been climbing for 12 years. I started competing indoors with the Ecuadorian Climbing Federation but I realized that my passion was to climb outdoors. I love traveling for climbing. I have experience climbing and competing in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile and Cuba. Climbing is my way of life; I always have climbing projects in mind and I like to challenge myself physically and mentally.
This is the first project of the kind, so I want to promote and support climbing in my own country.
Mafer Cevallos: I started climbing 15 years ago but in the last 7 years, climbing has become my way of life. I travel to climb and climb to live. I have experience climbing in Colombia and the US where I have done 3 road trips from Tahoe CA to Denver CO. I love climbing internationally but now it’s time to promote climbing in my home country. Currently, I am empower to teach climbing for women and I am proud and excited to have this project.
WHY?
•Ecuador has open and develop new areas of climbing but they are underuse
•Expand climbing community nationally and internationally
•Promote community based tourism
•Ecuador is still a chauvinist society that needs programs to empower women.
What We Need & What You Get

We are going to create a Big Audiovisual Project which means. We are going to have several people filming the roc trip for a month. We also have the expenses of the trip and logistics,women's clinic events,etc.Therefore, we need funding for it $40.000
We are going to show the episodes in youtube with a backup bitacora of the places. A final documentary will be also presented.
This is an adventure trip where in each episode, we will show you : where to go, where to stay, what routes are available,and communities that surround them, etc. The idea is that people that travel to Ecuador are going to have all the necessary information about places to climb,camp or visit. 
People that help us raise money will get amazing gifts such as: T-shirts, stickers,rock climbing courses, rock climbing and mountaineering trips, homestay opportunities, Ecuador tourism advise, diverse souvenirs from Ecuador,advertisment. 

 We are going to reach our entire goal one way or another because  we believe in it and this is one of the kind projects in Ecuador

In our years of traveling for business, we grew tired of spinning luggage and ill-equipped backpacks better suited to singular activities, like daily commuting or long-term travel. What we really wanted was something that could satisfy our short-term business travel needs - light, minimal storage for formal attire in a cool, but office-appropriate style - while also giving us the space and compartmentalization we need to experience the new destinations we constantly find ourselves in. In the end, we’ve come up with the Lemore Business Travel Backpack, which we believe is ideally suited for anyone’s business travel needs. We hope you agree!</p><div> </div><p>Risks and challenges</p><p>We’re confident in our abilities to deliver the goods on time and to your highest expectations, but we also want to be clear that there are always risks when launching such a product.

 Team storyWe’re a team of designers who travel often and far for work. In our years of traveling for business, we grew tired of spinning luggage and ill-equipped backpacks better suited to singular activities, like daily commuting or long-term travel. What we really wanted was something that could satisfy our short-term business travel needs - light, minimal storage for formal attire in a cool, but office-appropriate style - while also giving us the space and compartmentalization we need to experience the new destinations we constantly find ourselves in. In the end, we’ve come up with the Lemore Business Travel Backpack, which we believe is ideally suited for anyone’s business travel needs. We hope you agree! Risks and challengesWe’re confident in our abilities to deliver the goods on time and to your highest expectations, but we also want to be clear that there are always risks when launching such a product. We’re going to work hard to minimize these risks by closely coordinating with the manufacturer and running quality control checks throughout the manufacturing process. We will not rush through these steps and will tackle them carefully, one by one. Through it all, we’ll be completely transparent with you, sharing updates and making sure you’re always in the loop.

I am Vytautas Jankulskas, passionate Traveler and Photographer from Lithuania. Last 4 years I was intensively travelling around the world.



During this Time I managed to hitchhike more than 100 000 Km in 37 different countries in 3 continents. On the way i did various photography projects and I was published in some newspapers.
My Photographs from Remote village in Indonesia in Dailymail.
Interview about me and Photographs from photo series about Jakarta’s Slums (Lithuanian Only)
My website

Campaign - Many Faces Of Kindness
I want to hitchhike from my home country Lithuania all the way to Indonesia and create photo book of people that helped or inspired me one way or another. That's why the books will be called Many Faces of Kindness. 


I want to show everyone that the world is not that scary place as we think it is, the world is full of kind and friendly people.



I will hitchhike through countries like Turkey, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, Maybe even more. All this trip is gonna be done by Hitchhiking. I will rarely stay in hotels, only if its necessary. I will be camping, staying with locals and using Couchsurfing.


This trip should take me from 6 to 12 months.

The route will look more or less like this:



After the trip I will come back home to Lithuania, select the best portraits from the trip and create  Photo Book.



Examples of what kind of Photos I am going to take on this journey and what photos you can expect in this photo book:



The book will contain 50-80 portraits. Mostly it's gonna be faces, with a little description of the person in Photographs.
The exact shape and size of the book is not decided yet, but I will update you as soon as I will know.
I will also create blog and I will update it regularly so you can follow my trip and know where I am and what I do.
Where your contributed money will go

<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>As a mechanical engineer my mission is to create really useful tools for humanity. I do believe the ioCamper is the one. When I came up with the idea of ioCamper many people said it was impossible... Anyway, for me ""impossible"" is just a word, it means no more or no less than the other words... My favourite saying is: "" I didn't know it was impossible, so I've done it"" This leads me day by day, and will continue ‘til the end of time.</p>
<p>Just take a look around and see how many vans are around you, and all of them are a potential motorhome, if you think about the advantage of the ioCamper. If you don't have a van, you can get one from your workplace maybe or borrow it from your family or friends. There are many options... With the ioCamper a camping holiday will be easily available for many more people all over the world.  </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xFvfVHDySLo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3>...how it was started</h3>
<p>I always dreamed -like many others- to buy or build a caravan or a motorhome to enjoy the freedom with my family. When my son asked me to go for a camping holiday, I decided to make it for him unforgettable. We could have rented a tent, a caravan or I could modify my old van to a motorhome, but I wanted more flexibility, more space, and more comfort. In addition, I wanted to keep my 9 seater van's original functionality.  Keeping these preferences in mind, I came up with the idea of ioCamper. I found the best local automation, electrical and technical experts and we spent thousands of hours in my small workshop over the last 2 years. And now I'm really proud to introduce to you the ioCamper. We found that the ioCamper could be a solution for many other families who are in the same shoes as us. </p>
<p>We created this campaign to make the ioCamper available all over the world. To reach this we have to industrialize the production. With your help we can take the camping holiday to a new level and many families could discover the beauty of nature with the ioCamper loaded in a normal van. We appreciate your support in advance! For our backers we are going to send as a gift a premium quality T-shirt with our ioCamper logo on it. Find it on the perk site.</p>
<p>The main benefit of the ioCamper is that the small size closed box can be put into almost any existing van. You do NOT need to transform your van to a motorhome spending huge amounts of money, and do NOT need to modify anything on your van. The only thing you need to do is to screw down the fixing plates for safe transportation (provided with ioCamper) to the floor of the cargo. So, with ioCamper, you won't lose your van's original functionality and you'll be able to carry goods or people in the van as normal in the future. ioCamper also offers great additional usage possibilities - you can use it as a standalone apartment in your courtyard, or as a fishing bungalow, or many other ways. Perhaps you want to invite your friend or family members but you don't have enough space. Just open the ioCamper in your garden and use it as a small guest-house.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Some important questions with answers:</h3>
<ul><li>What kind of VAN can be loaded with ioCamper?</li></ul>
<p>The standard model has a size of 2.5 * 1.3 * 1.7 m (l * w * h), which can be fitted to any L1 H2 (or bigger) van such as Fiat Ducato, Citroen Jumper, Peugeot Boxer, Renault Expert, Iveco Daily, Volkswagen Crafter, Mercedes Sprinter, etc …</p>
<ul><li>Do you need any skills or training to use the ioCamper?</li></ul>
<p>No. Simply follow the user guide. The process is operated manually or by a mobile device which is connected to ioCamper's own Wi-Fi network, such as a mobile phone, tablet or laptop. </p>
<ul><li>How long does it take to open and use it?</li></ul>
<p>The apartment can be used within 5 to 10 minutes, depending on which way you want to use the ioCamper.</p>
<ul><li>Different variants available?</li></ul>
<p>You can choose between 3 different height sizes depending on your van (H1, H2 or H3), and also the appearance of the ioCamper (modern, vintage, country, summer style). Of course, we'll be able to customize the sizes in the future on demand.</p>

<p>The campaign will help develop the Byurakan community in an innovative, responsible and sustainable way by collecting natural water melting from <strong>snow-capped Mount Aragats</strong> to create a new experience for visitors.</p>
<p>It brings together <strong>two main directions.</strong></p>
<p>First, it brings “Responsible Agricultural Travel” to one of Armenia’s famous mountainous villages so visitors can enjoy first-hand experiences with host families. The project will enable about 25 households to be involved by opening their doors so visitors can experience village life and it will employ some 20 young people in newly created jobs.</p>
<p>Second, it creates the innovative <strong>""Magic Dream"" glass domes atop a new reservoir</strong>. The reservoir will irrigate about 10 hectares of community gardens in August, when temperatures soar and water is at a premium.</p>
<p><strong>This unique place will give visitors the opportunity for an incredible experience. Once filled, the reservoir pond will be stocked with indigenous fish and attractive to area wildlife. Adapting glass houses over the water will allow visitors to leisurely watch the water, mountain and stars in breathtaking vistas of our magical mountainous environment.</strong></p>
<p>Visitors can take part in specially designed tourist packages around the four peaks of Mount Aragats, Amberd Fortress, ancient churches, unique hikes to seldom seen monuments and archeological secrets, the Astrological Observatory, the Art Academy, Byurakan Studios, a local potter or woodworker, and more. They can also help local women dry fruit and other favorite delicacies, milk cows, taste lavash right from a traditional oven, watch Armenian pasta being made.</p>
<p>Since 2014, young people from living and working in Byurakan have been initiating tourism development programs focused on the production and development of agricultural commodities, including Chir’s House, strawberry production in the transition to organic certification, as well as the production of honey and a tourism welcome center. They also have run agriculturally and environmentally oriented camps for children and youth ages 6 to 16.</p>
<p>We need 3,000 people to join us by booking their vacation in advance with a 50% discount. Doing so will make the entire project a reality and create even more opportunities for our young people to continue to live and work right here at home.</p>
<p>The total cost of implementation is approximately $250,000. We already have $100,000 of the total in the form of professional engineering and construction for the reservoir, government reviews and approvals, work with host families, skills trainings for youth, and more. About 30 young people are also actively involved, carrying out various tasks such as organizing community meetings, communication and working with other area businesses.</p>
<p><strong>The missing amount is $150,000, which will be spent on the construction of the reservoir (3,000-4,000 meters cube) and the preparation and installation of the glass domes for visitors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3,000 people * $50 = $150,000</strong></p>
<p>People who cannot organize their holidays with us but who believe in the realization of our project can  join in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Donate $10 and get a special stamp, your name will be engraved on glass that will be installed near the entrance.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Donate $20 and you will be receive a bracelet made by women from the rural community to symbolize this initiative, and your name will be engraved on glass that will be installed at the entrance.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Donate $100, $500 or $1,000 to become a special partner in this social development project for Byurakan, and your name will be engraved on glass that will be installed near the entrance.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If we succeed in raising 50% or more of the amount, we will a create a special fund to  continue raising the balance until we realize this dream.</p>
<p>If we only collect up to 50%, the money will be invested directly into the families who will serve as hosts for visitors to ensure they have the knowledge and skills to make it a memorable experience in Byurakan.</p>
<p>If you know other people who are ready to help us spread our idea, it also will be very helpful for us .</p>
<p>We consider it a courageous challenge to launch such an initiative in our rural community and we look forward to everyone's support in reaching for the stars in Byurakan.</p>

<p>  With my experience of climbing in US, Norway, Italy, France, Switzerland, Iran and Georgia and skiing in all over Armenian and Great Caucasus range for many years, more like ever now, I have a strong feeling that I must do much more to rise the climbing and backcountry skiing activities in Armenia to the next level,  to make it well known for rock climbers and freeride skiers around the world.   </p>
<p>   I started climbing and skiing in Armenia since 2004. In 2008 I founded Up The Rocks club and in 2014 I co-founded Armenian Alpine Club SNGO. For many years we have been developing climbing and backcountry skiing in Armenia based on our enthusiasm. Under my initiative and management there have been organized numerous international and local events like <a href=""http://uptherocks.com/index.php/armenian-rock-climbing-festivals"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Armenian Climbing Festivals</a> (in 2009, 2011 and 2013), <a href=""http://uptherocks.com/index.php/events/rock-climbing-competitions/179-climbing-competition-in-armenia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Armenan Climbing Cup</a>, <a href=""http://uptherocks.com/index.php/rock-climbing-in-armenia/240-rock-us-in-the-caucasus-armenia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rock Us in the Caucasus</a> with American and Iranian Alpine Clubs, Armenian teams in international climbing camps in <a href=""http://uptherocks.com/index.php/rock-climbing-in-armenia/175-armenian-team-at-flatanger-climbing-festival"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Norway</a> and <a href=""http://uptherocks.com/index.php/rock-climbing-in-armenia/178-armenian-climbing-team-at-experience-the-rocks-of-georgia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gerogia</a>. I have set up numerous climbing and skiing routes, created <a href=""http://uptherocks.com/index.php/rock-climbing-in-armenia/rock-climbing-topo-armenia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">topos</a> (climbing maps). With support of Daniel Domongo and Karen Marutyan I had built <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BoulderTownClimbing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the first climbing gym in Armenia</a>.</p>
<p>   We have had numerous publications in famous magazines and website as well, like in <a href=""https://rockandice.com/climbing-destinations/armenia-rock-climbing-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rock and Ice</a>. Yet all this is still very little and slow compared to what I can do, which is so close to be realized. </p>
<p>Along with all this the rock climbing and alpine skiing is my profession as a mountain guide and tour operator. So the other side of this project is to aid me to drastically increase my guiding business which will make me self sufficient, free and independent to soak into climbing and skiing professionally and act like an artist to withdraw from this the best and the most. At this point it's obvious that the most of my income will be put back into the development of climbing and skiing in Armenia as always, it's a spiral cycle in my concept.</p>
<p>   Assessing all the work for this project, I can tell that this is no longer to be done with an enthusiasm anymore.  It goes extremely slow without funds. I can't have much expectations from government neither from grants. This is a perfect and sufficient business plan but even with this perspective I had very hard times trying to get business loans from banks without any success. </p>
<p>   So here is where your support to this funding is important and we'll do it together! This project is not only to make Armenia more popular among worldwide climbers and freeride skiers, to drive more tourists in Armenia and to improve my guiding business..  this is also important for the local youth who have slowly integrated into climbing and skiing during last few years.  <strong>This is to rise the bar high in Armenia, to open a space for them in these activities, so they would have motivation and stimulus to improve faster, rather than only watching high level of climbing and skiing in internet thinking that this is far away from from Armenia..</strong></p>
<p>   To <strong>Rise the adventure in Armenia </strong>to the next level I need $15.000. Here I'll be very clear with you in the breakdown:   </p>
<ol>
<li>First things first, Indiegogo platform fees, if the goal is reached about 8% of it ($1200) will go there.</li>
<li>$5000 will go directly into the projects like; expedition expenses (included covering the expenses of skiing/climbing buddies who come to support the project by volunteering bases), expenses to pay the professional staff who come to assist the production process with their equipment, and as well for covering expenses of purchasing needed equipment during the process. $500 of these money will go into building a website with full information of services I will provide and online booking page.</li>
<li>$4000 will go for buying a car to be independent and mobile to drive wherever and whenever needed.  </li>
<li>$4800 will go to supply my financially to make me well to do on upcoming seven months while I will act like dedicated artist as a project manager, climber, skier and filmmaker.  </li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<p><strong>What will you get if this amazing project is realized?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>For each donated $100 you will get one guided day with me in Armenia! It can be rock climbing, hiking or ski-touring/free-riding.  This will include the transportation cost as well, but the meals, accommodation and other expenses you will have to carry additionally. For each $150 you may have the same service in Georgia!  You can have multiple days of guided program according your donation.</li>
<li>For donation above $50 you will get an ""Up The Rocks"" unique T-shirt.</li>
<li>For donation up to $49 you will get my big appreciation and good energy sent back to you!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What if this campaign does not reach it's goal.</strong></p>
<p>   Well, first of all I hope it will reach the $15000 and even more which will bring more success to this project, but even if not, then your donation will still encourage me in this endeavor to realize this project, so any funding above $2500 will be a good aid. As you already know what have I been doing so far and it was upon my enthusiasm (often support of lots of friends), so I have an experience of finding ways to realize projects anyways.  In case the funding would be lower than $2500 I will close the campaign and refund you donations.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>   Many of my local friends and foreigners who visit Armenia ask me why is Armenia developing so slow and still being so unpopular since having such a big potential of rock climbing and freeride skiing. Well, this is a complex issue but I will try to give you a quick picture. First of all it's the lack of avid climbers and freeride skiers who live like dirtbag artists developing this cultures in their countries up to the highest levels. I have kind of taken this role in Armenia and was supported by friends and family for many years, but this is not enough yet. Here we come to the second topic which is the base of all. In some bigger western or Asian countries with better economics it has often being supported by governments, foundations, outdoor equipment producers and investments by stakeholders. Here in Armenia we do not have these opportunities at least at this stage, and that is why I need your support here!</p>
<p>   One of the biggest impact of this project is that it will create larger space for local youth where they will step with confidence, guidance and in this space they will finally have a stimulus to reach and overcome! If you go through <a href=""http://www.uptherocks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Up The Rocks</a> website you will already see how much have I done for this purpose so far. That is why I encourage you with confidence to be the part of this great and beautiful perspective going to be realized soon!</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>   The main risk and challenge is not to reach the goal of the campaign. The biggest challenge for me always was the only one thing - the lack of funds. But nothing else proves you better than my website that I overcome every challenge and do what I've got to do! </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>   Please keep on sharing this campaign with people who believes that outdoor activities can change and educate our societies, making our world cleaner, kinder, full of solidarity and love. Feel free to use Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>P.S. the updates for FAQ and media will come soon.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello my fellow Indiegogo backers my name is David Dominguez and I founded the water buddy. I’m the owner of two super active boxer dogs, Roxy and her daughter Zoey. And this is a little inside scoop on how these two helped me design the perfect water bowl for the dog on the go!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613544899/y21hdmt496rhjalwaglz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Being a dog owner and keeping your pets hydrated while doing activities is a must. Just like in humans, water is responsible for keeping your pet’s body functioning at peak levels. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614150169/ynh8whc78a9o3tx2uhdn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After trying multiple different water bottles on the market meant for your dogs. I realized one thing they all have in common, is that they are bulky and the extra weight can become a real inconvenience. </p>
<p>So I stuck to the concept of making the single water bottle work for both of us. But after plenty of wet floors and wasted water I thought there has to be a better way. And so the idea of the Water Buddy was born.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613631080/w1pkqhrwasbcrcwsh7ke.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Water Buddy Bowl</h3>

<p>It was a long journey creating multiple prototypes, many hours spent on Research and Development to finally engineering the perfect patent pending bowl. We designed our bowl to be light weight leakproof and conveniently small, but big enough so all size dogs can enjoy. All our water buddy’s are made out of a very strong and durable biosourced and biodegradable PLA.</p>

<p>Ensuring there was no leaks while also ensuring our mechanism helped water get from bottle to bowl without cross contamination allowing you to still enjoy fresh clean water.</p>

</div><div><ul></ul></div></div>","Short Summary
Hello my fellow Indiegogo backers my name is David Dominguez and I founded the water buddy. I’m the owner of two super active boxer dogs, Roxy and her daughter Zoey. And this is a little inside scoop on how these two helped me design the perfect water bowl for the dog on the go!

Being a dog owner and keeping your pets hydrated while doing activities is a must. Just like in humans, water is responsible for keeping your pet’s body functioning at peak levels. 

After trying multiple different water bottles on the market meant for your dogs. I realized one thing they all have in common, is that they are bulky and the extra weight can become a real inconvenience. 
So I stuck to the concept of making the single water bottle work for both of us. But after plenty of wet floors and wasted water I thought there has to be a better way. And so the idea of the Water Buddy was born.

The Water Buddy Bowl

It was a long journey creating multiple prototypes, many hours spent on Research and Development to finally engineering the perfect patent pending bowl. We designed our bowl to be light weight leakproof and conveniently small, but big enough so all size dogs can enjoy. All our water buddy’s are made out of a very strong and durable biosourced and biodegradable PLA.



The Mechanism 

Ensuring there was no leaks while also ensuring our mechanism helped water get from bottle to bowl without cross contamination allowing you to still enjoy fresh clean water.



The Cap
The most important part however, is that the cap is compatible to 90% of the markets water bottles. (all 1 inch plastic water bottles)

 Ultimately, while out on the go with your furry family member and happen to run out of water simply stop at your nearest convenience store pick up your favorite bottled water and let the Water Buddy do the rest.

What We Need And What You Get
Tooling
(All of our water buddy's are guaranteed to all backers of our campaign and will be made to order using the highest grade PLA filament.)
Our goal is to get our product tooled for physical (injected molds) made in Shenzhen China, packaged and shipped to us.

If campaign isn’t able to reach our goal, all funds will still go towards improving the water buddy, more R&D, marketing and our dream of having The Water Buddy in stores world wide.
Packaging
Our team has also put together a concept of how the water buddy packaging will look. We wanted this packaging too look attractive but also informative, a packaging that wouldn't take up a lot of self space but you knew where it was at once you entered a store.

In case of an emergency: press the bullet tip against the car side window.  The spring-loaded internal striker will release and hammer the ultra-hard carbide tip with a powerful force and shatter tempered glass. 
 
 

 WYN Bullet is a must-have car escape/rescue tool for all safety conscious drivers.  When every second matters, you can count on it to save your life, and the lives of other people.WHEN EVERY SECOND MATTERS, ARE YOU PREPARED?
 In 2017 there were 20,800 accidents related to fire or water submersion, resulting in 1,874 deaths in the US.  In an accident, a car may lose all electrical power or its doors are jammed.  When a car falls into the water, you only have a few seconds to escape to safety.Extensive study by AAA (American Automotive Association) published in 2019 confirmed that emergency vehicle escape tools are a lifesaver.
 
 Developed for first responders (firefighters, law enforcement and EMT) WYN Bullet is compact, powerful and efficient.  When your job is to save lives, you must use the best tools! 
 
Our Patent-Pending Technology positions the internal striker inside the bullet head, directly behind the tungsten tip.  This innovative design is very compact and efficient, allowing you to break tempered glass windows with ease.
PATENT PENDING           
 
WYN BULLET EVEN WORKS UNDERWATER

  

 This small, efficient and easy-to-use tool is made of precision machined parts with high quality materials.Designed to mimic the look of a real bullet, WYN Bullet looks strikingly beautiful and is amazingly powerful.  You will definitely enjoy holding this revolutionary rescue tool in your hands. 
  SPECIFICATIONS: 
 Length: 77 mm | 3.0 in
 Diameter: 13.0 mm | 0.5 in
 Weight: 45 gr | 1.6 oz
 Material: Stainless Steel & Tungsten Carbide 

 Finish: SS | Black Oxide
 Accessory: Pocket Clip & Keyring Loop 
 TUNGSTEN CARBIDE TIP
 STAINLESS STEEL & BLACK OXIDE FINISH
 
 WYN Bullet is compact for easy storage and access.  It comes with a removable pocket clip and key-ring loop so you can always carry it with you.  It is an essential addition to your everyday carry (EDC).  
 
 Need to focus, stay calm, stay awake or boost your excitement?  WYN Bullet is a highly addictive and effective focus tool.  Pressing and releasing the bullet head with your finger has a tantalizing effect. The bullet tip creates a high pressure point but is not sharp to cut your skin. The more you press, the higher the pressure.  If you press it all the way and release the internal striker, it will give you anything from a jolt to a sharp shock, depending on where you place the tip. The goal is to get as close to the edge without being struck.   
 THIS BULLET SAVES LIVES!
 Why Emergency Window BreakerIn September 2017 on the way home from work I witnessed an accident on the other side of the road. A car turned sideways and slammed into a tree.  People immediately ran to help but the two occupants were unconscious and the car doors were locked. It took a few minutes for the firetruck to arrive, but it felt like an eternity.I checked the news the next day and found out that the driver died. I kept wondering what if they could get to him sooner.We all hope that accidents never happen, but hope is not enough. When it does happen are you prepared?  Even if it never happens to you, knowing that you are prepared would give you that peace of mind.Join us today and help bring this product to life.

Tremors, Evacuate!7.0 on Richter scale!6.9 Magnitude Quake!Catastrophic 9.0 Earthquake!

Though these are small decimals, but they represent huge damage when it comes to Earthquakes, which are unpreventable acts of nature beyond the control of humans. These account for huge loss of human life and economical resources following their
occurrence and often leads to adverse effects on the economy of a nation.



It is evident that we cannot STOP it, but what if we could predict it prior to its occurrence? We can curtail the heavy losses of life and economy.  And thus here we have Cu-REO to do the work for us!
                                                                   
What is Cu-REO?
                                                                    

Cu-REO,
CubeSat for Remote Earth Observation(s), is an initiative by students of University
of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES), India, to design and develop a
nanosatellite which is going to aid in prediction of the earthquakes prior
to their occurrence. 
In
the initial stage it will be used as a 'test bed for verifying the hypothetical
research work in the detection of seismic activity by studying the perturbations
in the magnetic field of Earth', however, in later stage it will be used to detect the earthquakes solely.  
This is what Cu-REO looks like:
         
Wouldn’t
it be great to know about earthquakes before they actually hit us? Well, these
perturbations are observed prior to actual occurrence with a time span
varying from a week to a even a month. 
Weighing merely a kilogram and having dimensions of 10 x 10 x 10 cm, this cube is being designed to do wonders.
Cu-REO is first CubeSat to be designed for such
an operation. Its ancestor, the Demeter satellite was launched in 2004 by
France, for carrying out a similar task, but the satellite was much larger and
the project, much costlier. 
Lets have a look at the various components/systems being installed on-board this satellite:

          

Cu-REO would be deployed at altitude ranging in between 675 – 750 km, where it will carry
out this task. Since these perturbations fall on the Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF)
and Very Low Frequency (VLF) bands of the magnetic wave spectrum of earth, a
high sensitivity magnetometer is being installed on-board Cu-REO, to detect the
required electromagnetic field perturbations.
                                                                   
Benefits Of The Project
                                                                   
Panacea for losses relating Earthquakes Verification of the hypothetical work relating the prediction of earthquakes is the main motive of the mission. If proved successful, it will help the society reduce the losses due to earthquakes.

Effective Way of Providing Student's Education.Cubesats provide students a platform to deal with real-life problems and proves to be an efficient way of inculcating the true aspect of subject in them.

Paves a path for Young Minds in countrySuch a technical development looked forward to pave the way for a large student audience in
     country allowing the fresh minds to explore the space for advancement in space sciences.

SUCH A BIG FEAT - AND WHAT COULD ONE WOMAN DO? HOW COULD I REACH AND EMPOWER EVERY EXPECTANT WOMAN ON THIS PLANET?</p>
<p> IT RECENTLY BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT AMONGS MY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES IN MATERNAL &amp; INFANT HEALTH, REGARDLESS IF A WOMAN FELT HER EXPERIENCE WAS EITHER NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE;THERE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR. AND THEREIN LAID THE ANSWER...</p>

FIRST OF ALL - MY NAME IS ANGELA AND I AM A SELF PROFESSED BIRTH NERD. I AM A LOVER OF LIFE, MOTHER TO TWO AWESOME KIDS, AND DEDICATED BIRTH WORKER. YOU CAN CHECK ME OUT AT WWW.ANGELAGALLO.COM




  IF YOU'VE COME ALL THIS WAY, YOU ARE MOST PROBABLY JUST AS PASSIONATE AS I AM ABOUT ALL THINGS CHILDBIRTH (OR AT THE VERY LEAST, A LITTLE CURIOUS!). SO LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO THE GOOD STUFF, SHALL WE?

 WHAT THE HECK IS 'DIARIES OF A GLOBE TROTTIN' DOULA'?

DGTD IS A CREATIVE PROJECT & DOCUMENTARY MINI-SERIES THAT WILL POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE WAY WOMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES BIRTH.  IT IS  A MOVING COLLECTION OF IMAGES & STORIES; CAREFULLY PICKED FROM ALL 4 CORNERS OF THE GLOBE.   LITERALLY SPEAKING' I AM A DOULA AND THESE WILL BE MY DIARIES!
HOLD UP, WHAT IS A DOULA?
A DOULA IS THE FANCY PANTS TERM FOR PROFESSIONAL LABOUR SUPPORT PERSON. BESIDES ATTENDING BIRTHS PROVIDING EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL SUPPORT; I ALSO WORK WITH A WOMAN & HER FAMILY, DURING & AFTER HER PREGNANCY. MY ROLE IS BEST DESCRIBED AS A COMBINATION OF ALL THINGS COACH, EDUCATOR, CHEERLEADER, CONFIDANTE, SLEUTH, CRONE, CLEANER, CHILDCARE, AND DOG-SITTER. I AM ANYTHING A BIRTHING WOMEN NEEDS ME TO BE . IN A NUTSHELL - I SERVE HER IN WHATEVER CAPACITY SHE NEEDS ME, AS SHE NAVIGATES ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE, JOYFUL, AND CHALLENGING TIMES OF HER LIFE.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO WORK WITH SOME OF THIS COUNTRY'S MOST AWESOME MAMAS (AND THEIR EQUALLY GORGEOUS BABIES!),  THERE IS STILL MUCH OF WHAT I WITNESS TO BE BE DISCONCERTING. CAN'T TASTE THE SWEET WITHOUT THE SOUR, RIGHT?
OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, I HAVE GOT TO ADMIT THERE HAS BEEN SOME MOMENTS WHERE I FELT LIKE GIVING UP ALTOGETHER.  MAINSTREAM BIRTH CULTURE HAS HAD ME FEELING LIKE I WAS BANGING MY HEAD AGAINST A BRICK WALL ON MANY OCCASIONS. BUT IT WAS THAT SAME FRUSTRATION THAT LED ME TO SOME MAJOR 'A-HA!' MOMENTS. I THOUGHT LONG AND HARD ABOUT HOW I COULD DO MY PART IN IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOMES FOR WOMEN. SUCH A BIG FEAT - AND WHAT COULD ONE WOMAN DO? HOW COULD I REACH AND EMPOWER EVERY EXPECTANT WOMAN ON THIS PLANET?
 IT RECENTLY BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT AMONGS MY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES IN MATERNAL & INFANT HEALTH, REGARDLESS IF A WOMAN FELT HER EXPERIENCE WAS EITHER NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE;THERE ALWAYS SEEMED TO BE ONE COMMON DENOMINATOR. AND THEREIN LAID THE ANSWER...
HER INITIAL IMPRESSION AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS CHILDBIRTH & MOTHERHOOD.
AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE MY PROJECT COMES IN!



SHROUDED IN SO MUCH MYSTERY, AND OFTEN THE VICTIM OF SOME SERIOUSLY DRAMATIC STORYTELLING; SOCIETY'S PERCEPTION OF CHILDBIRTH IS PRETTY SCARY. WHETHER IT'S THE EXAGGERATED WAY HOLLYWOOD PORTRAYS IT (PRODUCTION VALUE, BABY!), THE TERRIBLY TACKY SEX-ED VIDEOS IN HIGH SCHOOL, OR THE HORROR STORIES OUR FRIENDS & FAMILY ARE SO EAGER TO SHARE - MOST OF US GROW UP WITH SOME PRETTY SKEWED OPINIONS AND VIEWS ON THE MATTER. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THAT RESULTING FEAR & ANXIETY FOLLOWS US THROUGH LIFE, AND ENDS UP IMPACTING OUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH BIRTH.
CALL IT SCIENCE, COINCIDENCE, OR THE LAWS OF ATTRACTION; ONE THING IS FOR SURE. THE WAY WE SEE BIRTH, AFFECTS THE WAY WE BIRTH, THE WAY WE PARENT, THE WAYS WE LIVE.
AN AMAZING STUDY ON HOW A WOMAN'S FEARS AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS CHILDBIRTH INFLUENCESTHE MATERNITY CARE SHE RECEIVES, AND THE OUTCOMES SHE EXPERIENCES CAN BE FOUND HERE
WHAT'S MY PLAN OF ACTION?
CHANGE THE FACE OF BIRTH FOR EXPECTANT MOTHERS AROUND THE WORLD. NO SMALL FEAT, I KNOW.  BUT IT CAN BE DONE. 
EXPLORE  SOCIAL & CULTURAL NORMS. 
SHATTER ANY OUTDATED, PRE-CONCEIVED NOTIONS.
CHALLENGE MODERN PERCEPTIONS.
GET TO THE ROOT OF FEAR.
AND HOW?
FOR 6 MONTHS I AM ENDEAVORING TO TRAVEL TO A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN HOPES OF SHOWCASING HOW POSITIVE & DYNAMIC PREGNANCY, CHILDBIRTH, AND PARENTHOOD CAN BE.  RURAL, URBAN, REMOTE - I WILL EXPLORE IT ALL. I AM LIAISING WITH INCREDIBLE ORGANISATIONS, DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS, AND LIKE-MINDED INDIVIDUALS WHO SHARE MY VISION. 
WHAT ARE THE CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN ATTITUDES? HOW IS THAT AFFECTING THE WAY WOMEN BIRTH IN THESE COMMUNITIES? WHAT CAN THE VIEWER TAKE AWAY FROM THESE STORIES? HOW CAN SHE APPLY THIS INSIGHT TO HER OWN EXPERIENCES?
MY FINDINGS WILL BE TURNED INTO A REAL TIME MINI-SERIES THAT WILL FOLLOW ME AS I DIG DEEP INTO THE WAY HUMANS BIRTH AROUND THE WORLD.  I THEN ASPIRE TO PUBLISH A BOOK TO BE RELEASED IN 2017.



WHAT AM I ENVISIONING?

<p><strong>English text Below - </strong><br/>820 km uzunluğundaki Karia Yolu üç arkadaşın büyük kentler dışında çok da bilinmeyen bir bölgede yaptıkları araştırmalar sonucunda oluşturuldu. Yürüyüş rotası ücra köyler, harabeler, plajlar ve çok değişken coğrafyalardan geçiyor. 2012 yılında MUTSO ve GEKA’nın desteği ile proje hayata geçirildi. Şimdi işaretleri yenilemek, kapanmış patikaları açtırmak ve çeşitli sebeplerle zarar görmüş yönlendirme levhalarını değiştirmek için desteğinize ihtiyacımız var. 2 aylık bu çalışma sürecinde bölgede yaşana halk ile çalışıp yerel ekonomiye destek sağlamaya özen göstereceğiz. <br/><br/><strong>Hikayemize gelince...</strong></p>
<p>İsmim Altay Özcan ve Karia Yolu'nun kurucularından biriyim. Doğa tutkunu biri olarak, gerçek anlamda bir ekspedisyona 2007 yılında fotoğrafçı ve deniz kanosu rehberi olarak katıldım. Suriye sınırından başlayıp İstanbul'a kadar giden proje boyunca kıyı şeridini daha iyi görme fırsatına sahip oldum. Acaba bir sonraki köy nasıl bir yer, peki ya bir sonraki koyda neler var, şu dağın tepesinden etraf nasıl gözüküyor, hep daha ileride ne var diyerek bir adım daha attım. Ve bunu insanlarla paylaşmayı çok sevdim, çünkü bence başka yerler, köyler, manzaralar ve en önemlisi hayatlar görmek ön yargılarımızı aşmak, algılarımızı açmak, daha iyi bir insan olmak demek. İşte Karia Yolu'da bu şekilde doğdu. </p>
<p>2009 yılında kazısına katıldığımız Tlos antik tiyatrosunda otururken projenin yaratıcılarından biri olan Yunus Özdemir, Karia’da yeni bir yürüyüş rotası oluşturmak fikri ile geldi. Ben bölgenin sahilini kano ile geçerken görmüştüm, Yunus ise bu bölgedeki az bilinen antik kentleri üniversitedeki hocaları ile beraber gezmişti. Bu konuşmadan 3 ay sonra, Kasım ayında neye karıştığımızı tam olarak bilmeden yola çıktık. Yazın rehberlikten kazandığımız paralarla 4 yıl boyunca bolca kaybolduk, patikalar araştırdık, köylüler ile konuşup bilgi almaya, boyumuzu aşan çalıların arasında yolumuzu bulmaya çalıştık, bir kaç kez balıkçı tekneleri tarafından kurtarıldık, kimi zaman hayvan hırsızı kimi zaman defineci olarak düşünüldük…Ve en nihayetinde Türkiye’nin en uzun mesafeli yürüyüş rotasını oluşturmuş olduk. </p>
<p>İlk işaretlemeler, levhalar, patikaların temizlenmesi ve rehber kitabın basımı Muğla Ticaret ve Sanayi Odası ve GEKA’nın desteği ile 2013 yılında gerçekleştirildi. Bu dönemden sonra rota üzerinde yapılan her bakımı kendi cebimizden ve kitap satışlarından elde ettiğimiz gelirler ile yaptık. Fakat herkesin bu bölge için yapabileceği bir şey var. Sizin yardımlarınızla rota üzerindeki işaretleri yenileyecek, levhaları tamir edebilecek, kapanmış patikaları açtırabilecek kısacası bu parkurları herkesin kolaylıkla gezip görebileceği bir hale getireceğiz. </p>
<p>Bu patikalarda yürürken doğanın muhteşemliğinin farkına varabiliyoruz fakat rotaların bu hale gelmesi için ne kadar çok çaba harcandığını fark edemeyebiliyoruz. Örnek vermek gerekirse, 2 kişilik bir ekip günde maksimum 10 km işaretleyebiliyor; bir 3 km’lik bir patikanın temizlenmesi için 3 kişilik bir ekip tam 3 gün çalışıyor. Bu kampanyaya destek olarak her yıl binlerce kişinin yürüdüğü bu rotaların bakımlarında sizin de bir katkınız olacak. Bu sayede yerli ve yabancı Akdeniz ve Egenin buluştuğu bu harika bölgeyi keyifle keşfetmeye devam edebilecekler. </p>
<p><strong>MALİYETLER</strong></p>
<ul><li>Hesaplamalar gönüllülerden oluşan 5 kişilik bir ekibin tüm rotayı işaretlemesinin 2 ay süreceği düşünülerek yapıldı. Buna ek olarak köylülerden oluşan 4 işçinin gerekli yerlerdeki patikaları temizlemesi için 1 aylık bir süre düşünüldü. </li></ul>
<p>Harcama kalemleri aşağıdaki gibi olacak;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Patikaların açılması.</strong> Patikaların açılacağı köyden 4 işçi günlük 100 TL yevmiye çalıştırılacak. Farklı yerlerde yapılacak olan bu çalışma toplam 1 ay sürecek. Böylece hem kapanmaya yüz tutmuş patikalar açılacak hem de yerel ekonomiye katkıda bulunulmuş olacak.<br/><strong>Toplam: 12000 TL / 3500 USD</strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Araç Kiralama -</strong> İşaretleme çalışmaları sırasında pickup tarzı bir araç kiralanacak. Aylık 3000 TL ile 2 ay kiralanacak. <br/><strong>Toplam: 6000 TL / 1750 USD </strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Yakıt</strong> - Ortalama olarak her gün 50 TL’lik bir yakıt harcanacağını düşünüyoruz. <br/><strong>Toplam: 3000 TL / 860 USD</strong> <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Konaklama</strong> - Bazen uygun fiyatlı bir pansiyonda bazen de kiralanan bir dairede konaklama yapılacak. 5 kişi için günde ortalama 200 TL den 60 gün olarak hesaplandı. <br/><strong>Toplam: 12000 TL / 3500 USD</strong> <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Yemek</strong> - Olmazsa olmaz. Yorgun bünyelerimizi kendine getirmesi için kişi başı günlük ortalama 50 TL harcanacağını düşünüyoruz. Yani 60 gün boyunca 5 kişinin yemek masrafı.<br/><strong>Toplam: 15000 TL / 4300 USD</strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Boya</strong> - İki buçuk litrelik bir teneke boya 45 TL, bir adet beyaz bir adet de kırmızı alınacak. Geçmiş deneyimlerimiz her kutu ile 25 km işaretleyebildiğimizi gösterdi. Yaklaşık 600 km’lik bir etabın yeniden işaretlenmesi gerekiyor, ki bu da her bir renk için 48 teneke yapar.<br/><strong>Toplam: 2160 TL / 625 USD </strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Malzemeler</strong> - Çalışmalar süresince eldiven, tel fırça, tiner ve benzeri malzemeleri ihtiyacımız var. Her kişi 1 haftada 1 çift eldiven ve 1 fırça değiştiriyor. <br/><strong>Toplam: 500 TL / 150 USD </strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Levhalar</strong> - Bir çok sebepten zarar görmüş bazı yönlendirme levhalarının yenilenmesi gerekiyor. 50 adet yönlendirme levhasının tanesi 100 TL.<br/><strong>Toplam: 5000TL/ $1500</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Genel Toplam - </strong> <strong>55.660 TL / 16185 USD </strong></p>
<p>Eğer hedeflediğimiz miktara ulaşamazsak elde edilen para yine de bu amaç için kullanılacak. Süreç daha uzun sürecek belki ve bütün rotayı işaretleyemeyebiliriz fakat yine de boya alıp, ulaşım ve konaklama masraflarını karşılayabileceğiz. <br/>Sizin desteğiniz ile rotanın daha iyi bir hale gelmesini ve Türkiye’nin pek keşfedilmemiş bu muhteşem yerlerine sürdürülebilir alternatif turizmin gelmesini sağlayabiliriz. Çevreye zarar vermeyen, doğa, tarih ve kültüre değer veren bir turizm. Rota üzerindeki ana turizm mekanlarından uzak köylerde yerel ekonomiye katkıda bulunacağına inanıyoruz. İster maddi olarak yardımda bulunarak, isterseniz de sosyal medyada kampanyamızı duyurarak, herkesin katkıda bulunabileceği bir şey olduğuna inanıyoruz. </p>

<p>------------------------------------------<br/>My name is Altay Ozcan and I am one of the creators and managers of the Carian Trail. As someone passionate about nature, I did my first expedition as a sea-kayak guide and photographer in a project that aimed at and succeeded in paddling Turkish coast from the Syrian Border to Istanbul. I have always liked exploring new places, seeing the next village, one more cove, the view from the very top of a mountain, always striving to go further. The next step has been to share these discoveries, experiences and landscapes and hopefully have a positive impact on their lives. This is how the Carian Trail was born. </p>
<p>In 2009, Yunus, co-creator, brought up the idea of setting a new hiking trail while we were sitting above an ancient theatre of Tlos. Previously I had paddled along the same coast where he had toured unknown ruins as an archaeologist in the ancient region called Caria. We started our research not knowing what we were getting ourselves into. After 4 years of getting lost, looking for new paths, talking to villagers, blazing through overgrown bushes, being rescued a few times by fisherman and draining our bank accounts, we found ourselves having completed Turkey's longest hiking trail. </p>
<p>The initial waymarkings, signposts and printing of the guidebook was sponsored. Since then, we have personally funded all upkeep of the trail that spans from the Mediterranean to the Aegean. But now, we need your help. With your generous donations, we will be able to continue to renew the fading way markings, fix the signposts that were damaged over time, clean the overgrown paths and help to keep the trail alive.</p>
<p>While walking along paths, it is easy to appreciate the beauty but you may not realize how much work goes in to the maintenance of these trails. If we are to give an example, the re-waymarking of a 10 km route takes an entire day, and cleaning of a 3 km overgrown path takes a team of three 3 days. By contributing to this cause, you will be playing a role in maintaining the trails that thousands of hikers walk each year. Thus locals and foreigners alike can continue to explore this beautiful part of the Southwest coast of Turkey. </p>
<p><strong>Costs and Expenses</strong></p>

Yürüyüş rotası ücra köyler, harabeler, plajlar ve çok değişken coğrafyalardan geçiyor. 2012 yılında MUTSO ve GEKA’nın desteği ile proje hayata geçirildi. Şimdi işaretleri yenilemek, kapanmış patikaları açtırmak ve çeşitli sebeplerle zarar görmüş yönlendirme levhalarını değiştirmek için desteğinize ihtiyacımız var. 2 aylık bu çalışma sürecinde bölgede yaşana halk ile çalışıp yerel ekonomiye destek sağlamaya özen göstereceğiz. Hikayemize gelince...
İsmim Altay Özcan ve Karia Yolu'nun kurucularından biriyim. Doğa tutkunu biri olarak, gerçek anlamda bir ekspedisyona 2007 yılında fotoğrafçı ve deniz kanosu rehberi olarak katıldım. Suriye sınırından başlayıp İstanbul'a kadar giden proje boyunca kıyı şeridini daha iyi görme fırsatına sahip oldum. Acaba bir sonraki köy nasıl bir yer, peki ya bir sonraki koyda neler var, şu dağın tepesinden etraf nasıl gözüküyor, hep daha ileride ne var diyerek bir adım daha attım. Ve bunu insanlarla paylaşmayı çok sevdim, çünkü bence başka yerler, köyler, manzaralar ve en önemlisi hayatlar görmek ön yargılarımızı aşmak, algılarımızı açmak, daha iyi bir insan olmak demek. İşte Karia Yolu'da bu şekilde doğdu. 
2009 yılında kazısına katıldığımız Tlos antik tiyatrosunda otururken projenin yaratıcılarından biri olan Yunus Özdemir, Karia’da yeni bir yürüyüş rotası oluşturmak fikri ile geldi. Ben bölgenin sahilini kano ile geçerken görmüştüm, Yunus ise bu bölgedeki az bilinen antik kentleri üniversitedeki hocaları ile beraber gezmişti. Bu konuşmadan 3 ay sonra, Kasım ayında neye karıştığımızı tam olarak bilmeden yola çıktık. Yazın rehberlikten kazandığımız paralarla 4 yıl boyunca bolca kaybolduk, patikalar araştırdık, köylüler ile konuşup bilgi almaya, boyumuzu aşan çalıların arasında yolumuzu bulmaya çalıştık, bir kaç kez balıkçı tekneleri tarafından kurtarıldık, kimi zaman hayvan hırsızı kimi zaman defineci olarak düşünüldük…Ve en nihayetinde Türkiye’nin en uzun mesafeli yürüyüş rotasını oluşturmuş olduk. 
İlk işaretlemeler, levhalar, patikaların temizlenmesi ve rehber kitabın basımı Muğla Ticaret ve Sanayi Odası ve GEKA’nın desteği ile 2013 yılında gerçekleştirildi. Bu dönemden sonra rota üzerinde yapılan her bakımı kendi cebimizden ve kitap satışlarından elde ettiğimiz gelirler ile yaptık. Fakat herkesin bu bölge için yapabileceği bir şey var. Sizin yardımlarınızla rota üzerindeki işaretleri yenileyecek, levhaları tamir edebilecek, kapanmış patikaları açtırabilecek kısacası bu parkurları herkesin kolaylıkla gezip görebileceği bir hale getireceğiz. 
Bu patikalarda yürürken doğanın muhteşemliğinin farkına varabiliyoruz fakat rotaların bu hale gelmesi için ne kadar çok çaba harcandığını fark edemeyebiliyoruz. Örnek vermek gerekirse, 2 kişilik bir ekip günde maksimum 10 km işaretleyebiliyor; bir 3 km’lik bir patikanın temizlenmesi için 3 kişilik bir ekip tam 3 gün çalışıyor. Bu kampanyaya destek olarak her yıl binlerce kişinin yürüdüğü bu rotaların bakımlarında sizin de bir katkınız olacak. Bu sayede yerli ve yabancı Akdeniz ve Egenin buluştuğu bu harika bölgeyi keyifle keşfetmeye devam edebilecekler. 
MALİYETLER
Hesaplamalar gönüllülerden oluşan 5 kişilik bir ekibin tüm rotayı işaretlemesinin 2 ay süreceği düşünülerek yapıldı. Buna ek olarak köylülerden oluşan 4 işçinin gerekli yerlerdeki patikaları temizlemesi için 1 aylık bir süre düşünüldü. 
Harcama kalemleri aşağıdaki gibi olacak;


Patikaların açılması. Patikaların açılacağı köyden 4 işçi günlük 100 TL yevmiye çalıştırılacak. Farklı yerlerde yapılacak olan bu çalışma toplam 1 ay sürecek. Böylece hem kapanmaya yüz tutmuş patikalar açılacak hem de yerel ekonomiye katkıda bulunulmuş olacak.Toplam: 12000 TL / 3500 USD 

Araç Kiralama - İşaretleme çalışmaları sırasında pickup tarzı bir araç kiralanacak. Aylık 3000 TL ile 2 ay kiralanacak. Toplam: 6000 TL / 1750 USD  

Yakıt - Ortalama olarak her gün 50 TL’lik bir yakıt harcanacağını düşünüyoruz. Toplam: 3000 TL / 860 USD  

Konaklama - Bazen uygun fiyatlı bir pansiyonda bazen de kiralanan bir dairede konaklama yapılacak. 5 kişi için günde ortalama 200 TL den 60 gün olarak hesaplandı. Toplam: 12000 TL / 3500 USD  

Yemek - Olmazsa olmaz. Yorgun bünyelerimizi kendine getirmesi için kişi başı günlük ortalama 50 TL harcanacağını düşünüyoruz. Yani 60 gün boyunca 5 kişinin yemek masrafı.Toplam: 15000 TL / 4300 USD 

Boya - İki buçuk litrelik bir teneke boya 45 TL, bir adet beyaz bir adet de kırmızı alınacak. Geçmiş deneyimlerimiz her kutu ile 25 km işaretleyebildiğimizi gösterdi. Yaklaşık 600 km’lik bir etabın yeniden işaretlenmesi gerekiyor, ki bu da her bir renk için 48 teneke yapar.Toplam: 2160 TL / 625 USD  

Malzemeler - Çalışmalar süresince eldiven, tel fırça, tiner ve benzeri malzemeleri ihtiyacımız var. Her kişi 1 haftada 1 çift eldiven ve 1 fırça değiştiriyor. Toplam: 500 TL / 150 USD  

Levhalar - Bir çok sebepten zarar görmüş bazı yönlendirme levhalarının yenilenmesi gerekiyor. 50 adet yönlendirme levhasının tanesi 100 TL.Toplam: 5000TL/ $1500


Genel Toplam -  55.660 TL / 16185 USD 
Eğer hedeflediğimiz miktara ulaşamazsak elde edilen para yine de bu amaç için kullanılacak. Süreç daha uzun sürecek belki ve bütün rotayı işaretleyemeyebiliriz fakat yine de boya alıp, ulaşım ve konaklama masraflarını karşılayabileceğiz. Sizin desteğiniz ile rotanın daha iyi bir hale gelmesini ve Türkiye’nin pek keşfedilmemiş bu muhteşem yerlerine sürdürülebilir alternatif turizmin gelmesini sağlayabiliriz. Çevreye zarar vermeyen, doğa, tarih ve kültüre değer veren bir turizm. Rota üzerindeki ana turizm mekanlarından uzak köylerde yerel ekonomiye katkıda bulunacağına inanıyoruz. İster maddi olarak yardımda bulunarak, isterseniz de sosyal medyada kampanyamızı duyurarak, herkesin katkıda bulunabileceği bir şey olduğuna inanıyoruz.

------------------------------------------My name is Altay Ozcan and I am one of the creators and managers of the Carian Trail. As someone passionate about nature, I did my first expedition as a sea-kayak guide and photographer in a project that aimed at and succeeded in paddling Turkish coast from the Syrian Border to Istanbul. I have always liked exploring new places, seeing the next village, one more cove, the view from the very top of a mountain, always striving to go further. The next step has been to share these discoveries, experiences and landscapes and hopefully have a positive impact on their lives. This is how the Carian Trail was born. 
In 2009, Yunus, co-creator, brought up the idea of setting a new hiking trail while we were sitting above an ancient theatre of Tlos. Previously I had paddled along the same coast where he had toured unknown ruins as an archaeologist in the ancient region called Caria. We started our research not knowing what we were getting ourselves into. After 4 years of getting lost, looking for new paths, talking to villagers, blazing through overgrown bushes, being rescued a few times by fisherman and draining our bank accounts, we found ourselves having completed Turkey's longest hiking trail. 
The initial waymarkings, signposts and printing of the guidebook was sponsored. Since then, we have personally funded all upkeep of the trail that spans from the Mediterranean to the Aegean. But now, we need your help. With your generous donations, we will be able to continue to renew the fading way markings, fix the signposts that were damaged over time, clean the overgrown paths and help to keep the trail alive.
While walking along paths, it is easy to appreciate the beauty but you may not realize how much work goes in to the maintenance of these trails. If we are to give an example, the re-waymarking of a 10 km route takes an entire day, and cleaning of a 3 km overgrown path takes a team of three 3 days. By contributing to this cause, you will be playing a role in maintaining the trails that thousands of hikers walk each year. Thus locals and foreigners alike can continue to explore this beautiful part of the Southwest coast of Turkey. 
Costs and Expenses


We have estimated that it will take 5 friends (volunteers) two months to renew all the waymarks. In addition, we will need to hire a group of 4 workers for a month to cut and clean all the paths.

Here's a breakdown of all expenses:

Trail cleaning- We will pay each of four workers 100TL a day for 30 days. They will open up and clean any overgrown paths.                                                                    

       Total: 12000TL/ $3500
Car rental- We will need a pickup for transportation throughout the waymarking process. This will cost 3000 TL a month and be used for two months.            
        Total: 6000TL/ $1750
Fuel- Of course, that car also needs gas. We are estimating that it will take about 50TL worth of gas per day to get us around.                                                     
         Total: 3000TL/ $860
Accommodation- The five of us will have to stay somewhere, be it a few rooms in a budget hotel or renting an apartment to share, we are estimating 200TL a night for 60 days.                                                                                                                                                 
       Total: 12000TL/ $3500
Food- Everyone's favorite! It will cost about 50TL a day per person to keep our bellies full. We will be feeding our group of 5 for 60 days.                                         
        Total: 15000TL/ $4300
Paint- Each can of paint is 45TL, we need one red and one white at all times. We have learned that these two cans last about 25 km. About 600km of the trail need fresh waymarks, so that's 48 cans of paint.                                                      
        Total: 2160TL/ $625
Supplies- We also need to buy gloves, brushes, paint thinner, and the like. Each person tends to go through a brush and a pair of gloves a week.                     
​         Total: 500TL/ $150
Signposts- We need to renew many of the signposts. Planning to have 50 new signs made, each costing 100TL.                                                                                          
        Total: 5000TL/ $1500
                                                                                          Grand Total: 55.660TL or $16,185
If we don't succeed in reaching our $16,185 goal, the money that we do collect will still be put to good use. The upkeep process will take much longer, but we will still be able to buy paint, pay for transportation and accommodation so we can mark some of the trails ourselves. 
With your help, we can keep the trail alive and in good condition, thus continuing to bring the right kind of tourism into one of the most beautiful and undiscovered regions of Turkey. We hope to promote the economy on a local level, bringing a source of income to those living in traditional villages along the trail, while at the same time sharing the history, culture, and landscapes found here without harming the natural environment.

</div></div>","What is AnyWay?AnyWay is an ""innovative step forward in the world of navigation services.""We offer people the opportunity to be a part of a large community that will help redefine a new genre of crowd sourced data. AnyWay mobile app works in partnership with it's website counterpart feeding information from users into the website, exporting it into the mobile app. AnyWay is EveryWay, the application provides routes and data for cars, public transport, cyclists and pedestrians, this combined with it's minimalist look and intuitive design allows AnyOne to easily navigate.


Our Story
We are a couple of university students fascinated by travelling. Hiking, cycling, driving and all forms of public transport we have been through different countries meeting new people from different cultures. We have been reliant on navigation apps and know the ins and the outs of their application in travelling. 
Through our journeys we have become aware of the limitations of most navigation apps out there.

""You Wouldn't believe how many times I've been lead to a dead end by online maps""

The Simple Truth!
Machines cannot do it all, they aren't 100% accurate and the more times we've been lost, the more times this has been clear. It's not the machines fault, there's just no data there.


Particularly for hiking, routes just don't exist, at least not on navigation apps. Hiking just hasn't caught up with modern technology and heres why...


People know hiking routes!
Different people, different places we all have our planned routes and it's about time we share them!
Just talking, we became thinking of cool and interesting ways hiking with technology and other problems could be solved.

Now we want to share these ideas with you and hope that you will agree and back us to improve the way we travel, helping us to develop this innovative app for the community. 


Who is AnyWay for?
Hikers, Walkers, Drivers, Cyclists, Parents, Friends... you get the point. 
Anyone should be allowed to travel freely the way they want to, and this is the concept we have developed AnyWay around.

How does it work?
Community is key. Just like any other community we will have a connection of people working together, but online, on our maps service. 
People know best, and they know the specifics. Walking around or editing our maps you are contributing, sharing your data, your directions for other people to follow. This is AnyWays primary function, interactive maps generated by the community for the community!


But, we are more than just that a map service...

 








Any-Where, Any-How 
Our mobile app can be used on the go! whether it’s walking, cycling, using public transport or driving we will provide you with detailed maps, delivering you swiftly to your desired location. 







We are current, We are you 
AnyWay is not just an A-B navigation service. Events are listed in your area, in realtime,by you! Explore the world around you, connect with new people, make traveling an experience not a chore.
 


Together, we can change the way we travel!
We rely on your input! Our service runs on crowdsourced data, AnyOne can contribute to the maps on our website making it current, valid and personal. Upload your bands music event, promote your business, share your route. 







Help us Grow! 
Our biggest resource and compliment to our service is you, the user. Help us provide you with a better traveling experience by filling out our AnyWay survey and supporting us with a contribution.

resonate extremely well with everything we do in our lives and this is why we are trying to create a platform that takes the ‘dating’

new friends and sharing your passion!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Who Can Be Involved?</b></p>
<p>Amigo is born as an action and adventure sports idea. So the sports we are including in our original launch are all listed below, but that doesn't have to stay that way! We believe Amigo will be a community and we want input, so if we have missed something awesome (like extreme ironing) let us know!</p>

<p><b>What Next?</b></p>
<p>Amigo is more than a
pipe dream; we have taken this from a vague concept for a mobile app into
something real. We have produced the logic of the app, completed the graphic
design and produced a working prototype all through personal funding and skills.  We definitely believe in
this application and that is why we have committed a good amount of our own
personal time and funds to get it off the ground, and things are looking good!</p>

<p>The next stage is to take
this prototype to a launch application. To do this we have already partnered
with an excellent developer that shares our vision and passion. We have laid

made efforts to overcome them. Our first challenge is getting the right funding
to develop the application properly and have enough left over to test it
properly. Basically we want Amigo firing on all cylinders from the get-go. Our
next significant challenge will be gaining traction once we launch. The way the
application works, we are going to need a critical mass of users in each area

<p>Two years ago someone jokingly said; “Hey come
over here and look at this crazy adventure”!  A couple of my coworkers and
I wandered over to the computer and our lives changed.  All we wanted to
do from that day on was to fly to India and drive a feeble Rickshaw 2500 km
from Cochin to Jaisalmer.<br/>
<br/>
<span>Why drive 2,500km of remote rural villages,
off-road tracks, over the world's most dangerous highways, along stunning
coastal (but questionable) roads, up mountains and through a bit of jungle? I
really can’t explain it.  Maybe its a midlife crisis?  Maybe I hit my
head one too many times?  It doesn't matter because I'm going to do it.
 In fact 5 of my coworker’s and friends have decided to join me on this
epic adventure.<br/>
<br/>
We have saved all our coffee money to fund this
adventure.  The only thing left to do is give it a purpose.  Some
deeper meaning!  Some spiritual cause!  Maybe just add some good
Karma.  <br/>
<br/>
So we decided since we are going anyway, why not
gain some good Karma by doing it for charity.  With this lofty goal in mind we decided to hold out our hands and ask our friends, neighbours and any interested person for little help.  From all donations we have decided to donate to Cool Earth and the Nanaimo-Ladysmith Student Support Fund</span></p>

and the remuneration coming from Nepali workers abroad, particularly in the
Gulf states, are the two major contributors to Nepal's economy.</p>
<p>According
to the Finance Ministry of Nepal, tourist arrivals plunged 46 percent in 2015
as a series of disasters (earthquake and blockade) pounded Nepal’s tourism
sector.</p>
<p>According to a report prepared by the ministry, Nepal lost
352,330 tourists during the review period of 10 months, hitting foreign
exchange earnings and jobs in the industry hard. The country received 300,325
foreign visitors by air until October 2015, down from 652,655 in the same
period in the previous year (2014).</p>
<p>The worst effect has been witnessed with employment in the
tourism industry. The ministry said that jobs in the country’s tourism sector
had gone down by 25 percent due to the series of misfortunes. The Finance
Ministry report said that employment in hotels and restaurants had gone down by
50 percent.</p>

<p>I have been working in the field of IT since 2001 on system, network, web and mobile platform. Since 2005, I have been running my own business in training and consultation sector.</p>
<p>The earthquake of 25th April 2015 caused a very negative impact on business as with the country as a whole. Specially the blockade was unbearable. This situation forced me in thinking about working on strengthening the platform as it seems obvious that Nepal didn't have a sustainable economic platform. I spent my time connecting with organizations and likeminded individuals on discussion on how the dream of a sustainable Nepal can be achieved.</p>
<p>On 25th of December 2015, I met with Shiva K Shrestha and we connected instantly and started working together on realizing our common dream. Meeting with Myrthe and Linda added more strength to our plan and we formed a long term strategy for supporting Nepal's economy through entrepreneurship development. </p>
<p>We teamed up to form Access Helpline, which will work as a support platform for locals and travelers and provide easy access to information and services and at the same time provide local businesses an opportunity to reach out to their audience.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p>I'm a Dutch woman who came to Nepal on 2015 January as a speech therapist and  fell in love with the country and the people. When the earthquake on 25th of April 2015 happened I was back in
Holland and my heart told me to come back and help as much as possible. I found Bring thoughts to Action flyer in a restaurant and got interested instantly. I got more connected and got in charge of different
projects. In the end of 2015 I went back to Holland due to my visa situation but came back in 2016 due to love for Nepal and her people. </p>
<p>When I got back I realized that there are already more
than 50,000 NGO in Nepal so my focus shifted more towards bringing out sustainable solutions which can improve quality of life in Nepal and increase job opportunities. </p>
<p>Through brainstorming sessions, I connected with likeminded people and we
started working on Access Helpline. I believe this is a feasible, practical and
necessary solution which will improve the image of Nepal to the world and provide a better experience to the travelers and locals. </p>

In the end of 2015 I had to go back to my home country due to visa situation.

I came back to Nepal in 2016 with the sole purpose of helping individuals and organizations work towards sustainable solutions. I teamed up with group of likeminded people and started working on concept of Access Helpline, which promises to create job opportunities for hundreds of Nepalese and at the same time supports tourism and local businesses. </p>

Being a Nepali I feel strongly responsible for being an example for my own
Nation. We can make a different by building up platforms where people can

sustain their families. I believe we can create it here. Nepal have so much potential

People of Nepal are still struggling to meet their basic needs for a

matter has now been settled, and Nepal can rise and march on again- yet, the
country needs financial incentives, opportunities to grow and to show its
well-renowned hospitality and beauty. 
What can you explore in Nepal? 
Nepal boasts indescribable natural beauty. Hills upon hills of

peaks covered in eternal snow on the horizon, including 8 out of the world’s 14

What is the impact of earthquake on Nepal?
Nepal has three main religions: Hinduism, Buddhism and tourism. Tourism
and the remuneration coming from Nepali workers abroad, particularly in the
Gulf states, are the two major contributors to Nepal's economy.
According
to the Finance Ministry of Nepal, tourist arrivals plunged 46 percent in 2015
as a series of disasters (earthquake and blockade) pounded Nepal’s tourism
sector.
According to a report prepared by the ministry, Nepal lost
352,330 tourists during the review period of 10 months, hitting foreign
exchange earnings and jobs in the industry hard. The country received 300,325
foreign visitors by air until October 2015, down from 652,655 in the same
period in the previous year (2014).
The worst effect has been witnessed with employment in the
tourism industry. The ministry said that jobs in the country’s tourism sector
had gone down by 25 percent due to the series of misfortunes. The Finance
Ministry report said that employment in hotels and restaurants had gone down by
50 percent.

Kathmandu Post

This has had a serious impact on the quality of life of Nepali people. People
are forced to either struggle or leave their country in search of alternatives.
More than 4 million Nepalis are living abroad due to lack of opportunity in
Nepal to fulfill their basic needs.
How can your visit help?
Your visit will help Nepal recover from this crisis. Every
dollar you spend on accommodation, food and activities will support local
businesses and create thousands of job opportunities. This will improve quality
of life of people in Nepal and help them stay with their family. What is Access Helpline?Nepal lacks a proper information resource platform. Therefore,
it may be difficult for tourists to find the desired products
and services. Businesses in Nepal also struggle in promoting their products,
services, offers and activities, as reaching out to travelers has not been
coordinated in any way yet. 
Access
helpline promises to deliver easy access to information and
help promote local businesses through our website, mobile app, 24x7 helpline
and information desks. 
Information about businesses, services and places of interest will
be digitized and made publicly available through VibesNepal.com.
Local businesses will gain more visibility. Travelers and locals will be able
to learn more about what is available and access services more easily. 
Access Helpline mobile app will enable travellers to chat live and/
or make calls from their smart phone anytime and anywhere. The mobile app
will also introduce other attractive features, making your search for services
and products fun. 
24x7 helpline will answer queries from travellers and/or provide
access to critical services (medical, visa, embassy services etc.) in case of
emergency. 
Travellers will also be able to visit information desks and
resolve their queries or problems. We are planning to set up 2 information
desks in the heart of the Kathmandu tourist district (Thamel).

How will Nepal benefit from our campaign?
With our campaign we wish to encourage people all around the
world to make Nepal their travel destination. The fund raised from the campaign
will also help launching Access Helpline, which will directly benefit Nepal by:

Providing jobs in data collection,
     marketing, administration and management to 120+ Nepalis within 2 months
     from launching.  
Enhancing experience of tourists
     during their stay in Nepal by providing easy access to
     information and services. 
Promoting local businesses, their
     products and services. Access Helpline is aiming to promote more than
     50,000 businesses in 2 years.

What is special about Access Helpline?
Access Helpline is a project of passion created by a team of
individuals who have the best interest in supporting Nepal. We wish to give
hope and to set an example by offering job opportunities to socially marginalised
groups, therefore 20% of roles in Access Helpline will be given to people with
disabilities. 
Access Helpline will also spend 25% of its profit on projects
related with youth empowerment (professional and personal skill-building
trainings) and community development (supporting connection, communication
and collaboration between community members). 
We believe our project will contribute to helping Nepal rise
again, in a more sustainable way.
You can help us accomplish it!

 Tanka Ram Poudel - Business Strategy, Project Planning

I have been working in the field of IT since 2001 on system, network, web and mobile platform. Since 2005, I have been running my own business in training and consultation sector.
The earthquake of 25th April 2015 caused a very negative impact on business as with the country as a whole. Specially the blockade was unbearable. This situation forced me in thinking about working on strengthening the platform as it seems obvious that Nepal didn't have a sustainable economic platform. I spent my time connecting with organizations and likeminded individuals on discussion on how the dream of a sustainable Nepal can be achieved.
On 25th of December 2015, I met with Shiva K Shrestha and we connected instantly and started working together on realizing our common dream. Meeting with Myrthe and Linda added more strength to our plan and we formed a long term strategy for supporting Nepal's economy through entrepreneurship development. 
We teamed up to form Access Helpline, which will work as a support platform for locals and travelers and provide easy access to information and services and at the same time provide local businesses an opportunity to reach out to their audience. 



 Myrthe Bakels - Human Resource and Marketing

I'm a Dutch woman who came to Nepal on 2015 January as a speech therapist and  fell in love with the country and the people. When the earthquake on 25th of April 2015 happened I was back in
Holland and my heart told me to come back and help as much as possible. I found Bring thoughts to Action flyer in a restaurant and got interested instantly. I got more connected and got in charge of different
projects. In the end of 2015 I went back to Holland due to my visa situation but came back in 2016 due to love for Nepal and her people. 
When I got back I realized that there are already more
than 50,000 NGO in Nepal so my focus shifted more towards bringing out sustainable solutions which can improve quality of life in Nepal and increase job opportunities. 
Through brainstorming sessions, I connected with likeminded people and we
started working on Access Helpline. I believe this is a feasible, practical and
necessary solution which will improve the image of Nepal to the world and provide a better experience to the travelers and locals. 

 Linda Ravn Olsen - Project Manager

I'm a Danish woman who came to Nepal as a traveler and
fell in love with the country and the people. Two days after surviving the
devastating earthquake on 25th of April 2016, Shiva K Shrestha and I started the
NGO Bring Thoughts to Action.
In the end of 2015 I had to go back to my home country due to visa situation. After months of relief work and volunteering, I realized that there is a lot to be done for Nepal and Nepalese people to become self sufficient. I came back to Nepal in 2016 with the sole purpose of helping individuals and organizations work towards sustainable solutions. I teamed up with group of likeminded people and started working on concept of Access Helpline, which promises to create job opportunities for hundreds of Nepalese and at the same time supports tourism and local businesses. 
Being one of the core members of Access Helpline gives
me the hope and passion to find the most beneficial solution to build up a
society where we support each other. 





 Shiva K. Shrestha - Project Advisor

Two days after surviving the devastating earthquake
25th of April 2016, Linda Ravn Olsen and I started the NGO Bring Thoughts to
Action.
Being a Nepali I feel strongly responsible for being an example for my own
Nation. We can make a different by building up platforms where people can
connect and collaborate. Nepal need to be sustained by improving the financial
situation through jobs. More than 4 million Nepalese are already working abroad to
sustain their families. I believe we can create it here. Nepal have so much potential
through local resource and services to give.  (Founder of Hostel Fireflies and Kathmandu Eco Hostel).

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Alberta Henry and I was born and raised in Cameron, AZ, the East Gateway to the Grand Canyon National Park, in the far western region of the Navajo Nation. My family and I created the Big Hogan Enterprise to share the Navajo culture, language, and history with the tourists who visit the Grand Canyon. The Big Hogan is a traditional and sacred homestead for five generations of my family. We aspire to revitalize the Navajo culture, protect the natural resources and inspire visitors to become stewards of this sacred area by offering a unique cultural experience combined with the powerful beauty of the Little Colorado River. 
My business is selling the experience of my culture to tourists who pass through the area to visit the Grand Canyon every year. The Big Hogan Enterprise has withdrawn 50 acres of land from  the Navajo Nation  and will offer Hogans to rent, hikes to historic sites, a Hogan for viewing, and storytelling, Rustic camping and beautiful canyon views.
My goal is to raise $40,000 for the start-up phase which is primarily infrastructure for building supplies and basic infrastructure which includes solar, restrooms, bath houses, and underground water tanks by February 2019. This includes:

Restrooms and bath houses - $10,000
Water tanks - $3,000
Solar - $13,500
Hogan building supplies - $13,500

 
Key Products and Services

 

Catering featuring local indigenous foods
Hogan Bed & Breakfast
Rustic camping
Stargazing
Guided tours - Hiking, Photography
Entertainment - Music, Storytelling


 
What We Need & What You Get
My family and a few investors have contributed the funds to build two hogans and purchase equipment to set up six tents with bedding. In order to offer more Hogan bed and breakfast and camping, we will need an additional $40,000 to cover basic infrastructure needed to operate a rustic experience in a safe, sanitary and comfortable place. The following is a breakdown of how the $40,000 will be spent:


Restrooms and bath houses for a total of $10,000
2 separate bath houses at $2,000 each which includes building supplies, shower stalls, window, door, skylight, solar light, solar water heater, and items for bathroom fixtures.
Restroom building with 6 toilets (3 women and 3 men with wash stations) at $4,000 which includes building supplies, toilets, tank for water, tank for sewage, 2 windows, 2 doors, 4 skylights, solar lights, solar water heater, and Items for bathroom fixtures.
4 waterless restrooms/outhouses (these outhouses will have a small container with cedar or pine shavings to dump after each use) at $500 each which includes building supplies.



Water tanks for a total of $3,000
2 - 1000 gallon tanks at $1000 each
Piping, connections and supplies at $1000



Off-grid solar power for a total of $13,500
Off-grid solar power kit with 7320 Watts of Panels and 8800 Watt 48VDC 120/240VAC Inverter Power Panel at  $10,000
Batteries at $1,500

Building materials for 2 Hogans for a total of $13,500
​Building materials, including windows, 2 doors, 2 skylights, furniture, bed, bedding, small light, small phone charger, small closet, and bedroom fixtures.


If we reach our goal of $40,000 we will be able to fund primarily the building supplies and basic infrastructure which includes solar, restrooms and bath houses.

<p>I love travelling although for many years,  I always get myself tangled up with annoying travel details the moment I confirm a trip.  I need to check weather forecast a couple of days before departure to make sure I bring the appropriate clothing.  I need  to find a way to pack efficiently and to make sure luggage is not overweight.</p>

<p>Hey! I'm Dave Odd, I was a stand-up comedian for 15 years and have been a lifelong naturalist. I have been Chicago's only full time professional forager since 2009 serving Chicago's finest restaurants and guiding my Eat the Neighborhood foraging tours for the public. It was always my dream to own property in the wilderness where people could come enjoy and learn about the splendor of nature. This is what the Land of Odd is all about. I will also be running very unique survival camp programs in conjunction with award winning chefs there. </p>
<p>The Land of Odd in Beaverville IL sits on 2 acres of pristine Kankakee Sands Prairie, one of the most unique habitats in the United States. 18 species of reptiles and amphibians, countless bird species, deer, turkey, bobwhite quail, coyotes, red fox, groundhogs, rare insects and butterflies, endangered species, and dozens of species of plants and wildflowers have all been observed on the property.</p>
<p>I've poured my heart and soul and life savings into this place and unfortunate events with shady contractors doing shoddy work or none at all have delayed the completion of the cabin and this is the last little bit I need to get it finished. My intention is that the Land of Odd will be a community center and meeting place for herpers, birders, wildlife photographers &amp; enthusiasts, botanists, researchers, hunters, fisherman, and anyone and everyone who enjoys the outdoors or just needs an escape.</p>
<p>I found a reliable, certified contractor to finish up the cabin, which will include insulating the ceiling, finishing the bathroom walls, and general shoring and sealing up and correcting the mistakes of previous work done. I need about $5000 to complete this with labor and materials and any left over will go towards furnishing the interior.</p>
<p>I have included a wide selection of perks, from use of the Land of Odd and campsites, to admission for my Eat the Neighborhood foraging tours, to produce bags, and more.</p>
<p>Thanks you in advance for your support!</p>

OUR HISTORY
Our founder Gina Garcia has had a love for trikes
ever since her parents purchased her a Big Wheel in the 70’s. Her fondness
towards anything on wheels grew to BMX, Rode, and Mountain bikes.  Finding herself volunteering for the Military
Cycling Association during her time in the Navy.  At the end of Gina’s enlistment she found
herself at a cross roads between College and Entrepreneurship and decide on
opening a local bicycle shop. During her many years as a shop owner she has
come across many styles of bicycles and tricycles.  But became fixated with an ornate Pedicab a
customer had brought in, that reminded her of the pictures and stories from her
mother operating them in the Philippines in the 50’s and 60’s. 

   Gina’s wheels began to spin with the
idea of why can’t they operate something like this in the United States and
with that initiative she had began to operate and design a modern version of
this old world technology. With her traditional
designs of pedicabs she was receiving common feedback.  Can these be made smaller and do you have
something I don’t have to pedal? With the knowledge of what people had wanted,
the idea of creating something fun to ride like her Big Wheel and functional
like her mother's pedicabs. Gina had packed up and moved to Southeast Asia for a

explorations emerged with an innovative Urban Design of an E-Trike sturdy
enough take a passenger as well as cargo and small enough to go through a standard
doorway.  Her mission, fun and functional, is
now complete with her creation of the Trikaroo Boomer. 

OUR NAME

“Trikaroo”
was derived from two words ""trike"" (vehicle having three wheels) and
""kangaroo"" the largest member of the marsupial family (animals that
carry their young). Think of it like a kangaroo on roller skates!
Trikaroo's are named after kangaroos. So of course we
had to name our flagship vehicle “Boomer” (the Alpha male kangaroo).
So grab
a Trikaroo and experience the coolest most unique way to get around. Take your
kids or your favorite copilot and hop on this convenient electric-powered
vehicle and zip around town, see the sights, and more.
OUR PLAN

Is to use the funds for manufacturing larger
production runs.
To buy tooling for in house customization.
To attend trade shows to introduce our product to dealers so they can carry the Trikaroo Boomer in stores near you.

<h5>Das Erlebnis in London</h5>
<p>Es begann alles im Februar 2017 in London. Während einem typischen Hop-on hop-off Tag vergeudeten wir Zeit bei der Such nach der richtigen Bushaltestelle, da die Karte vom Anbieter ihren Dienst nicht erfüllte. Auf der Karte waren drei Strassen eingezeichnet, doch vor uns lagen fünf. Wir begannen, uns näher mit dem Aufbau von Reiseführern zu beschäftigen. Unser Ziel war klar, wir wollten eine Applikation entwickeln, die neue Technologie verwendet aber den Fokus auf die Privatsphäre des Nutzers legt. Als wir damit begannen, stiessen wir auf etliche Probleme die zu lösen sind und fragte uns, wieso das bisher niemand gemacht hat. Mittlerweile wissen wir warum. Das ganze Konzept ist deutlich komplexer in der Umsetzung als erwartet, aber heute sind wir auf einem Stand der uns erlaubt zu sagen: ja, es funktioniert!</p>
<h5>Relevante Informationen</h5>
<p>Zunächst lag unser Fokus auf das Problem der Datenrelevanz. Wird ein Reiseführer veröffentlicht oder geht in den Druck sind die darin enthaltenen Daten bereits veraltet. Es fehlt an Aktualität, insbesondere dann, wenn ein staubiges Regal der Platz dafür ist. Die Daten im engeren Sinne haben per se keine Relevanz für den individuellen Nutzer. Klar, es gibt verschiedene Kategorien mit ihrem jeweiligen Fokus, doch entsprechen die aufgeführten Sehenswürdigkeiten und Lokale tatsächlich deinem Verständnis von einem perfekten Urlaub?</p>
<h5>Bewertungen und deren Massstab</h5>
<p>Ein weiteres Teilproblem stellten für uns die Bewertungsportale dar. Ist ein Lokal mit einer hohen Bewertung tatsächlich gut, wenn Gäste im vergangen Jahr schlecht bewerteten? Anhand von was wird bewertet? Wie viele Fake-Bewertungen sind vertreten und welche Auswirkungen haben dies? Algorithmen sind wertvolle Instrumente um Bewertungen zu erfassen, doch solange kein objektiver Massstab verwendet wird sind die resultierenden Ergebnisse nutzlos. Es besteht zwar die Möglichkeit, Bewertungen an eine Norm anzupassen, doch widerspricht dies der neuen EU Datenschutzverordnung, kein Weg, den wir einschlagen werden!</p>
<h5>Der Reiseführer des 21. Jahrhunderts</h5>
<p>Die meisten bereits verfügbaren Applikationen bieten entweder Reiseinformationen oder Hilfe bei der Reiseplanung. Sobald man vor Ort ist und an einen bestimmten Punkt navigieren möchte, im Idealfall ohne Datenverbindung, fehlen oftmals essentielle Funktionen. Wir entschieden uns all diese Funktionen zu vereinen und den Reiseführer vom verstaubten Regal ins 21. Jahrhundert zu katapultieren.</p>
<h5>Soziale Netzwerke, Privatsphäre und Datenbesitz</h5>
<p>In einem weiteren Schritt analysierten wir die Integration bestehender Lösungen in soziale Netzwerke wie Facebook, Instagram, etc. Wenn solche verfügbar sind werden deine Daten oftmals ihrem Schicksal überlassen. Durch das teilen werden auch häufig die Rechte am eignen Bild der Plattform übertragen oder gar abgetreten. Dies war der Zeitpunkt wo wir realisierten, dass es Zeit ist für ein soziales Reisenetzwerk, welches Reiseabenteuer mit digitalem Leben kombiniert und respektiert. Unsere Vision entstand: Dein digitales Leben ist dein Eigentum.</p>
<h5>Der etwas längere Weg</h5>
<p>Wir entschieden uns bewusst dafür, eine weitere Wegstrecke zu wählen. Die damit verbundenen Kosten sind wir hinsichtlich der verbesserten Privatsphäre bereit in Kauf zu nehmen. All deine Daten werden in der Schweiz gespeichert, wo der Zugriff strenger und restriktiver geregelt ist, als anderswo.</p>
<p>So, das wars. Travialist ist entstanden, ein einzigartige soziales (Reise-) Netzwerk wo deine Privatsphäre im Zentrum steht. Lass deine Daten in die Schweiz, zu uns, reisen, während du eine grossartige Stadt entdeckst, einen Cocktail am Strand geniesst oder einfach einen Kaffee in deinem Lieblingskaffeehaus trinkst.</p>

Todays currency is, beside all the cryptos, validated user data. You either pay a small fee or your data pays the fee for you. This fact is among all the most important, we need our community to understand. Travialist does not sell or share your data with third parties, unless you wish. This makes our project much more cost intensive and therefore only Freemium. So the advanced P2P Sharing functionality is only available for paid plans, but trust us, it is absolutely worth it!</p><details style=""margin:1em 0;""><summary style=""display: list-item;padding:1em 1em 1em 1.25em;line-height: 1.2em;cursor: pointer;border:1px solid #dbdbdd;background:#fffff;color: #000;""> <span style=""display: block;margin:-2.2em -1em -1em 2em;padding:1em;padding-left:0;font-weight: 700;""> Deutsch </span></summary><div style=""padding:1.25em 2em 2em;background:#fffff;padding-bottom:1.25em;"">

<h5>Unser Schlüssel, deine Privatsphäre</h5>
<p>Einer unserer wichtigsten Entwicklungsschritte ist das P2P Sharing. Dabei entscheidest du mit wem und wie lange du einen bestimmten Inhalt teilen möchtest. Die heutige Währung, neben all den Cryptos, besteht aus validierten Nutzerdaten. Entweder bezahlst du als Nutzer einen kleinen Betrag, oder die Bezahlung erfolgt über die Preisgabe deiner Daten. Dieser Fakt bildet das Zentrum unsere Kampagne. Wir möchten, dass unsere Gemeinschaft versteht, dass der Nutzen von Infrastruktur und die Privatsphäre nicht gratis sein können. Travialist verkauft weder deine Daten noch werden sie über Integrationen an Dritte weitergegeben, ausser du möchtest dies, indem du z.B. einen Inhalt auf Instagram weiterteilst. Diese Herangehensweise macht unser Projekt deutlich kostenintensiver und ist daher auch nur als Freemium erhältlich. Unser P2P Sharing ist deshalb auch nur in den kostenpflichtigen Plänen enthalten, aber vertrau uns, es lohnt sich!</p>

<p><strong>Dein digitales Leben gehört dir! </strong></p>
<p>Während heute verfügbare Reiseapplikationen oftmals keine oder eher magere Integrationen zu sozialen Netzwerken bieten, entschieden wir uns, das Ganze etwas genauer anzuschauen. Als wir Nutzungsvereinbarungen und Privatsphäreregelungen durchlasen entschieden wir uns, das Verständnis von digitaler Privatsphäre für den Nutzer zu erweitern. Mit der neuen EU Datenschutzverordnung im Kern, bieten wir dir alle traditionellen Standardfunktionen sozialer Netzwerke an. Mit einer Ausnahme: Die Entscheidung etwas hochzuladen, mit wem und wo zu teilen liegt in deiner Hand. Die Daten die du zu teilen wünschst werden verschlüsselt auf unseren Schweizer Servern gespeichert. Es ist deine Entscheidung ob du den Inhalt mit Freunden und Familie oder der ganzen Welt teilen möchtest. Dafür stehen wir mit unserem Namen!</p>

<h5>Weshalb es wert ist, uns zu unterstützen.</h5>
<p>Crowdfunding und Perks (als Angebote mit grossen Rabatten im Vergleich zu künftigen Preisen) gehören zusammen. Anstatt unsere Anteile zu veräussern und so unsere eigene Integrität durch institutionelle Anleger zu verlieren, entschieden wir uns, unseren Nutzern Einsparnisse auf unseren Plänen einzuräumen. Dies als Dankbarkeit für deine Unterstützung zu Gründerzeiten! Sei schnell, denn einige Perks sind nur für eine limitierte Anzahl Unterstützer verfügbar. Wir hoffen, dass dir unsere Auswahl von Angeboten für deinen neuen digitalen Lifestyle gefällt! Selbstverständlich ist es auch möglich, uns mittels Spenden zu unterstützen. Die Entscheidung liegt bei dir. Wir freuen uns auf deine Unterstützung und danken dir jetzt schon!</p>

<h5>Die Verwendung von deiner Unterstützung.</h5>
<p>Mit unserem Projekt erhoffen wir einen Betrag von 25'000 USD einzunehmen. Ja, damit können wir Software entwickeln. Bisher haben wir allerdings bereits ein Vielfaches davon ausgegeben und benötigen die Unterstützung für die Fertigstellung sowie die anfänglichen Kosten im Betrieb. Wenn wir über das Ziel hinausschiessen, können wir weitere Funktionen schneller integrieren, so zum Beispiel mehrere Sprachen von Anfang an anbieten. Hilf uns, unser Ziel zu erreichen und das was du bekommen wirst, wird grossartig sein!</p>

<h5>Wer wir sind.</h5>
<p><strong>Jan Dubs </strong><br/>Gründer und Hirn von Travialist<br/>Alle fünf Minuten hat er eine neue Idee und strebt Perfektion an. Das einzige Problem? Seine Ideen sind gut! Als wir über eine Teilveröffentlichung nachdachten, stoppte er uns. Travialist ist nicht bloss ein Reiseführer, ein Magazin oder ein Reiseplaner, nein, es ist die komplette Lösung die wir dir heute präsentieren!</p>
<p><strong>Reto Luscher </strong><br/>Mitgründer und Multimediatalent<br/>Egal ob es sich um bewegte Bilder oder Fotografie und Design handelt, Reto ist der Mann mit dem Auge dafür. Sein Erfahrungsschatz und seine unvergleichlichen Fähigkeiten helfen uns, anders zu sein und uns abzuheben. Sein fröhliches Lachen muss dich einfach glücklich machen, selbst nach 48 Stunden arbeiten funktioniert es noch!</p>
<p><strong>Mehul Nahar </strong><br/>Mitgründer und leitender Software Entwickler<br/>Wenn es um geographisch basiert Informationssysteme und sauberen Code geht, so vertrauen wir auf Mehul. Wir nennen ihn unsere Bibel, er leidet unter vielen schlaflosen Nächten, da er seit London damit beschäftigt ist, unsere Vision in ausführbaren Code zu schreiben.</p>
<p><strong>Danke für deine Zeit! </strong><br/>Wir hoffen, du kannst dich mit unserer Vision und Travialist identifizieren, genauso wie wir. Gerne darfst du dir einen Perk aussuchen oder uns mit einer Spende unterstützen. Wir freuen uns über jede Unterstützung und vertrauen darauf, dich bald auf Travialist zu sehen!</p>

<h5>Wie kann ich euch kontaktieren?</h5>
<p>Du findest unsere Details unten. Du kannst uns entweder ein <a href=""http://t.me/travialist"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Telegram</a> senden, oder uns eine <a href=""mailto:hello@travialist.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_top"">Mail</a> schreiben.</p>
<h5>Wie viel Reiseführer könnt ihr abdecken?</h5>
<p>Wir haben in unserer Datenbank mehr als 9000 Städte mit total mehr als 20 Millionen Points of Interest. Des Weiteren bekommst du mehr als 500 kuratierte Reiseführer direkt in der Applikation. Folge uns auf <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/travialist/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> wo wir täglich Orte posten, die wir mit Travialist anbieten können.</p>
<h5>Was ist der Unterschied zwischen Freebie und euren Premiumplänen (Explorer, Travialist)?</h5>
<p>Als <strong>Freebie</strong> kannst du Travialist gratis nutzen, aber mit eingeschränkter Funktionalität. Die Reiseführer (Explore) werden nur online verfügbar sein. Im Trip Bereich ist es leider nicht möglich deine Flüge kostenlos zu integrieren und so herauszufinden, ob der Flug verspätet ist, an welches Gate du musst, etc. Im Magazin wirst du die Artikel nur auszugsweise lesen können. Podcasts sind da leider nicht verfügbar. Unser P2P Sharing können wir dir als Freebie leider nicht anbieten, da auch wir die damit verbundenen Kosten tragen müssen. Wir empfehlen dir uns heute zu unterstützen. So viel sparen wie heute wirst du nie wieder können!</p>
<p>Der <strong> Explorer Plan </strong> ermöglicht es dir, Daten offline auf deinem Smartphone zu speichern. So bist du nicht auf eine aktive Datenverbindung angewiesen. Die profitierst von einer einfachen Flugintegration im Tripplaner und dem P2P Sharing. Im Magazin erhältst du pro Monat zehn Artikel mit dem dazugehörigen Podcast.</p>
<p>Mit dem <strong> Travialist Plan </strong> bekommst du unsere Vision direkt auf dein Smartphone. Du profitierst von allen Vorteilen des Explorer Plans und kannst deinen Flugstatus direkt abrufen, an welches Gate musst du? Bist du verspätet oder wurde gar dein Flug gestrichen? Im Messenger stellen wir dir ein weiteres Verifizierungs- und Verschlüsselungslayer bereit und du hast natürlich uneingeschränkten Zugriff auf unser Magazin und dessen Archiv. Und nun das wichtigste: Du bekommst den Stealth Mode. Du wirst Travialist anonym nutzen können und wie ein Stealth Flugzeug unsere Plattform überfliegen können. Teile, suche oder checke ein, ohne dass Datenanalyse betrieben wird. (Selbst wenn wir dies anonym tun, im Stealth Mode haben auch wir keine Möglichkeit dies zu tun!) Worauf wartest du noch? Hol dir deinen Lifetimeplan, welcher nur hier auf Indiegogo verfügbar ist. Nachdem das Crowdfunding beendet ist, wird es dazu keine Gelegenheit mehr geben!</p>
<h5>Wieso nutzt ihr nicht einfach Werbung auf eurer Plattform?</h5>
<p>Gute Frage! Einfache Antwort: Eine attraktive Werbefläche bedingt eine gewisse Reichweite. Mit anderen Worten, viele kaufwillige Nutzer. Wir denken eher daran eine Businesslösung in der Zukunft zu integrieren, welche dir als Nutzer attraktive und relevante Angebote bietet, als Kopfhörer, Pfannen und Schuhe durch Werbung anzubieten. Es gibt für uns zwei Schlüsselfaktoren: Erstens legen wir den Fokus auf das Nutzererlebnis und deine Privatsphäre. Wir möchten dir ein unvergleichlbares soziales Netzwerk mit Reiseapplikation anbieten, das nun mal halt seine Kosten hat. Zweitens, wenn wir Tools von Dritten zu Werbezwecken einbinden stellt dies erneut ein Risiko für deine sicher und private Nutzung der Plattform dar. Mit anderen Worten: Wir sind jung, in einem umkämpften Markt und brauchen dich als Nutzer, da du überlegst bevor du handelst.</p>
<h5>Kann ich mehrere Perks erwerben?</h5>
<p>Ja, das geht und darfst du natürlich sehr gerne!<br/><br/>Bitte beachte aber, dass die Kreditkartenlösung von Indiegogo dies allerdings nicht in einem Durchgang erlaubt. Wenn du mehrer Perks erwerben möchtest, musst du lediglich jeden zu erwerbenden einzeln kaufen.<br/>Weitere Informationen findest du hier im <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526766-How-do-I-claim-a-Perk-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indiegogo Support Bereich</a>.</p>
<h5>Wie kann ich einen Perk erweben?</h5>
<p>Schau dir die Liste der Perks auf der rechten Seite an (oder unten auf dem Handy). Wenn du einen Perk gefunden hast, der dir gefällt, brauchst du diesen nur anzuklicken um mit dem Prozess weiterzumachen. Weitere Informationen findest du im <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526766-How-do-I-claim-a-Perk-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indiegogo Support Bereich</a>.</p>

We would like to offer you an unmatched private social travel network which runs at certain costs. Second: We do not like to integrate with any third party as this will be another potential threat to your privacy. When we develop such a thing, we would allow placements that have nothing to do with you as a user. As you surely can imagine, this requires lots of budget.

Das Erlebnis in London
Es begann alles im Februar 2017 in London. Während einem typischen Hop-on hop-off Tag vergeudeten wir Zeit bei der Such nach der richtigen Bushaltestelle, da die Karte vom Anbieter ihren Dienst nicht erfüllte. Auf der Karte waren drei Strassen eingezeichnet, doch vor uns lagen fünf. Wir begannen, uns näher mit dem Aufbau von Reiseführern zu beschäftigen. Unser Ziel war klar, wir wollten eine Applikation entwickeln, die neue Technologie verwendet aber den Fokus auf die Privatsphäre des Nutzers legt. Als wir damit begannen, stiessen wir auf etliche Probleme die zu lösen sind und fragte uns, wieso das bisher niemand gemacht hat. Mittlerweile wissen wir warum. Das ganze Konzept ist deutlich komplexer in der Umsetzung als erwartet, aber heute sind wir auf einem Stand der uns erlaubt zu sagen: ja, es funktioniert!
Relevante Informationen
Zunächst lag unser Fokus auf das Problem der Datenrelevanz. Wird ein Reiseführer veröffentlicht oder geht in den Druck sind die darin enthaltenen Daten bereits veraltet. Es fehlt an Aktualität, insbesondere dann, wenn ein staubiges Regal der Platz dafür ist. Die Daten im engeren Sinne haben per se keine Relevanz für den individuellen Nutzer. Klar, es gibt verschiedene Kategorien mit ihrem jeweiligen Fokus, doch entsprechen die aufgeführten Sehenswürdigkeiten und Lokale tatsächlich deinem Verständnis von einem perfekten Urlaub?
Bewertungen und deren Massstab
Ein weiteres Teilproblem stellten für uns die Bewertungsportale dar. Ist ein Lokal mit einer hohen Bewertung tatsächlich gut, wenn Gäste im vergangen Jahr schlecht bewerteten? Anhand von was wird bewertet? Wie viele Fake-Bewertungen sind vertreten und welche Auswirkungen haben dies? Algorithmen sind wertvolle Instrumente um Bewertungen zu erfassen, doch solange kein objektiver Massstab verwendet wird sind die resultierenden Ergebnisse nutzlos. Es besteht zwar die Möglichkeit, Bewertungen an eine Norm anzupassen, doch widerspricht dies der neuen EU Datenschutzverordnung, kein Weg, den wir einschlagen werden!
Der Reiseführer des 21. Jahrhunderts
Die meisten bereits verfügbaren Applikationen bieten entweder Reiseinformationen oder Hilfe bei der Reiseplanung. Sobald man vor Ort ist und an einen bestimmten Punkt navigieren möchte, im Idealfall ohne Datenverbindung, fehlen oftmals essentielle Funktionen. Wir entschieden uns all diese Funktionen zu vereinen und den Reiseführer vom verstaubten Regal ins 21. Jahrhundert zu katapultieren.
Soziale Netzwerke, Privatsphäre und Datenbesitz
In einem weiteren Schritt analysierten wir die Integration bestehender Lösungen in soziale Netzwerke wie Facebook, Instagram, etc. Wenn solche verfügbar sind werden deine Daten oftmals ihrem Schicksal überlassen. Durch das teilen werden auch häufig die Rechte am eignen Bild der Plattform übertragen oder gar abgetreten. Dies war der Zeitpunkt wo wir realisierten, dass es Zeit ist für ein soziales Reisenetzwerk, welches Reiseabenteuer mit digitalem Leben kombiniert und respektiert. Unsere Vision entstand: Dein digitales Leben ist dein Eigentum.
Der etwas längere Weg
Wir entschieden uns bewusst dafür, eine weitere Wegstrecke zu wählen. Die damit verbundenen Kosten sind wir hinsichtlich der verbesserten Privatsphäre bereit in Kauf zu nehmen. All deine Daten werden in der Schweiz gespeichert, wo der Zugriff strenger und restriktiver geregelt ist, als anderswo.
So, das wars. Travialist ist entstanden, ein einzigartige soziales (Reise-) Netzwerk wo deine Privatsphäre im Zentrum steht. Lass deine Daten in die Schweiz, zu uns, reisen, während du eine grossartige Stadt entdeckst, einen Cocktail am Strand geniesst oder einfach einen Kaffee in deinem Lieblingskaffeehaus trinkst.
 
  The London Experience Driven by a bad London Experience in 2017 we started thinking about the concept of travel guides and Apps. Our aim was clear, we would use today's technology and focus on our digital footprint. Once we started it seemed and endless issue we face and were wondering why nobody built a solution, now we know, it is far more complex than we thought in the beginning but we are about to master it.  Relevant Information We focused on Information which in many cases was outdated once a travel guide was printed and does not necessarily have any relevance to what the individual traveler would  experience during his trip.  Rating and Scale Another issue was the rating from different platforms. Is a restaurant with a five star rating really that good as the last year only resulted in bad reviews. So all the algorithms are good, but as long as there is no objective scale behind, not even close to what we expect.  21st Century Upgrades Most Apps offer either information or planing functionality. When it comes to navigation, many lack this essential functionality. So we decided to merge it all, creating your all in one travel guide with 21st century upgrades.  Social Media, Privacy and Data Ownership The next part we analyzed was social media integration. Well if available, the application leaves privacy up to the platform you are sharing and you loose your intellectual property on your content. This was the time we all realized, it is time for a social travel network that combines your travel experience with your digital life. Our vision came up,  digital life is property.  The Extra Mile We decided to go the extra mile and extra cost factor and host every piece of data in Switzerland, where data access is far better regulated on a user perspective.So this is it, Travialist was born, a unique social travel network where your privacy matters! Let your data travel to Switzerland while you enjoy another great city, a cocktail on the beach or simply sip a drink in your favorite coffee shop. THE PRESSMEDIA COVERING US  THE APPYOUR NEW TRAVEL COMPANION Welcome home, Travialist! We proudly present you our design work an flow of what our understanding of digital life is. The first and only social travel network where sharing means no regrets. Take the next step in your future and say hello to an unmatched experience with your digital life fully under your control.  Deutsch 

Willkommen zuhause, Travialist
Es freut uns, dir hier unser Design und unser Verständnis von zeitgemässem digitalem Leben zu präsentieren. Das erste und einzige soziale Netzwerk wo Inhalte teilen keine Bauchschmerzen bereitet. Nimm den nächsten Schritt in deine Zukunft und sag hallo zu einem unvergleichlichen Erlebnis. Dein digitales Leben gehört dir und unterliegt deiner Kontrolle, nur deiner!
 
  THE FEATURESYOUR NEW TRAVEL LIFESTYLE Our key, your PrivacyOne of the most important features is our P2P content sharing approach where you decide what and how long to share. Todays currency is, beside all the cryptos, validated user data. You either pay a small fee or your data pays the fee for you. This fact is among all the most important, we need our community to understand. Travialist does not sell or share your data with third parties, unless you wish. This makes our project much more cost intensive and therefore only Freemium. So the advanced P2P Sharing functionality is only available for paid plans, but trust us, it is absolutely worth it!  Deutsch 

Unser Schlüssel, deine Privatsphäre
Einer unserer wichtigsten Entwicklungsschritte ist das P2P Sharing. Dabei entscheidest du mit wem und wie lange du einen bestimmten Inhalt teilen möchtest. Die heutige Währung, neben all den Cryptos, besteht aus validierten Nutzerdaten. Entweder bezahlst du als Nutzer einen kleinen Betrag, oder die Bezahlung erfolgt über die Preisgabe deiner Daten. Dieser Fakt bildet das Zentrum unsere Kampagne. Wir möchten, dass unsere Gemeinschaft versteht, dass der Nutzen von Infrastruktur und die Privatsphäre nicht gratis sein können. Travialist verkauft weder deine Daten noch werden sie über Integrationen an Dritte weitergegeben, ausser du möchtest dies, indem du z.B. einen Inhalt auf Instagram weiterteilst. Diese Herangehensweise macht unser Projekt deutlich kostenintensiver und ist daher auch nur als Freemium erhältlich. Unser P2P Sharing ist deshalb auch nur in den kostenpflichtigen Plänen enthalten, aber vertrau uns, es lohnt sich!
 
  EXPLOREBe home around the globe.With a global coverage of over 20 million Points of Interest, 9000 Cities and more than 500 curated Destinations, Travialist is your global travel guide. A complete custom map integration allows you to either search as in a traditional book or on the map. Carrying around books is the past, our solution will be your future and offer global coverage.  Deutsch 

EXPLORE - Entdecke
Sei zuhause auf der ganzen Welt 
Mit einer globalen Abdeckung von über 20 Millionen Points of Interest (Sehenswürdigkeiten, Lokal, Kaffeehäuser,…) aus mehr als 9000 Städten und mehr als 500 kuratierten Destinationen ist Travialist dein neuer Begleiter. Eine weiterentwickelte Kartenintegration erlaubt es dir, entweder traditionell wie in einem Reiseführer zu suchen, oder einen beliebigen Ort per Karte zu entdecken. Bücherschleppen gehört der Vergangenheit an, unsere Lösung wird deine Zukunft!
 
  YOUR TRIP  Find the trip that matches you.It is all up to you. You can either create a trip on your own or have a look at user generated trips. As a local you can curate your own city guide for chosen lifestyles. Be part of our community, who else could be the perfect guide?  Deutsch 

YOUR TRIP – Deine Reise
Finde ein Erlebnis, das zu dir passt. 
Es ist deine Entscheidung: Kreiere einen eigenen Reiseplan oder lass dich von Reiseführern inspirieren, die von anderen Nutzern erstellt wurden. Als ""local"" kannst du einen eigenen Reiseführer zu deiner Stadt erstellen und deinen Lifestyle zum Ausdruck bringen. Sei ein Teil unserer Gemeinschaft, wer sonst ist der perfekte Reiseführer?
 
  THE JOURNALGet inspired!Enjoy reading our monthly issue of the all new travel magazine right in the App. We partner with a team of independent journalists so the articles you read are not sponsored but based on experience and future trends. Tired of reading? No worries, listen to our journal while you are on the go thanks to the use of advanced text to speech!  Deutsch 

THE JOURNAL – Das Magazin
Lass dich inspirieren! 
Geniess die monatliche Ausgabe unseres unabhängigen Magazins direkt in der App in deiner Tasche. Wir arbeiten mit einem Team von Journalisten zusammen, welches dich auf dem Laufenden hält und über Reisetrends informiert. Unsere Artikel sind nicht gesponsert, sondern basieren auf Erfahrungen und Erlebnissen. Keine Lust zu lesen? Kein Problem, höre dir die Artikel als Podcast an. Durch die Verwendung fortschrittlicher Integrationen können wir dir dieses Erlebnis bieten.
 
  SECURE MESSAGINGEncryption 2.0Our built-in Messenger allows you to chat with your friends and family safely while on the go. Why another Messenger? Well, Travialist is based on Open Whisper Systems technology and adds two more layers. Traditional Messenger Services base on Google Cloud or AWS, we don't. Your communication will rest temporary on Swiss based Severs. By adding another layer of custom encryption, we do everything possible today to make your communication integer.  Deutsch 

SECURE MESSAGING – sichere Kommunikaton
Verschlüsselung 2.0 
Soziale Interaktion verlangt nach einer Nachrichtenaustauschplattform. Wir realisieren dies durch unseren eingebauten Messenger, der es dir erlaub, dich mit Freunden und Familie sicher zu unterhalten, während du unterwegs bist. Wieso ein weiterer Messenger? Travialist basiert auf Open Whisper Systems Technologie. Wir fügen zwei weitere Schichten Sicherheit für dich hinzu: Traditionelle Chatapplikationen speichern Daten in der Google Cloud oder in AWS, wir nicht. Deine Kommunikation wird temporär in der Schweiz auf unseren Servern gespeichert. Durch das Hinzufügen eines weiteren Verschlüsselungsmechanismus tun wir alles uns heute Mögliche, um deine Kommunikation integer zu gestalten.
 
  SOCIAL & PRIVATEDigital Life is Property!While existing Travel Apps often offer poor social network integration, we decided to have a better look at it. Once we read the terms & conditions, privacy statements, we decided to enhance the understanding of Privacy. Starting with GDPR compliance in the core, we offer you all the standard functionality a social network has. But the decision to upload and where to share lies in your hands. Again, the data you wish to share passes encrypted to our Swiss based Servers. It is your decision if it is friends & family or the whole world. This is what we guarantee with our name.  Deutsch 

SOCIAL & PRIVATE – sozial und privat
Dein digitales Leben gehört dir! 
Während heute verfügbare Reiseapplikationen oftmals keine oder eher magere Integrationen zu sozialen Netzwerken bieten, entschieden wir uns, das Ganze etwas genauer anzuschauen. Als wir Nutzungsvereinbarungen und Privatsphäreregelungen durchlasen entschieden wir uns, das Verständnis von digitaler Privatsphäre für den Nutzer zu erweitern. Mit der neuen EU Datenschutzverordnung im Kern, bieten wir dir alle traditionellen Standardfunktionen sozialer Netzwerke an. Mit einer Ausnahme: Die Entscheidung etwas hochzuladen, mit wem und wo zu teilen liegt in deiner Hand. Die Daten die du zu teilen wünschst werden verschlüsselt auf unseren Schweizer Servern gespeichert. Es ist deine Entscheidung ob du den Inhalt mit Freunden und Familie oder der ganzen Welt teilen möchtest. Dafür stehen wir mit unserem Namen!
 
  PLANSFOR YOUR ADVENTURE What the cost will be in the futureWe would like to completely disclose the future pricing of Travialist with respect to the functionalities. Our pricing represents the cost we have and therefore is structured according to offline data use, usage of our P2P Sharing, the Journal access and various integrations we use. We are very proud to announce the Stealth Mode.  Deutsch 

Was es in Zukunft kosten wird.
Wir möchten dir gerne unsere künftige Preisgestaltung hinsichtlich der Funktionen offenlegen. Die Kosten für den Endnutzer spiegeln unseren Aufwand und unsere Auflagen für dein Angebot wider. Die erste Bezahlfunktion ist die Nutzung der gesamten offline Daten, also Reisführer, Reisen, etc. Ein weiterer grosser Kostenfaktor ist das P2P Sharing, welches unsere Infrastrukturkosten bedingt. Das Magazin sowie Datenintegrationen von Dritte (Flugdaten, Wetter,…) bilden einen weiteren Kostenfaktor. Mit grosser Freude können wir dir als Nutzer im Travilalist Plan den Stealth Mode anbieten!
 
  OUR OFFERTHE PERKS Why it is worth it backing us todayCrowdfunding and Perks go hand in hand. Instead of throwing out our shares, we offer you savings on your plan and subscriptions as gratitude for your early adoption. Be fast, as some Perks will be only available to a limited number of contributors. We hope that you like our selection of your new digital lifestyle. Instead of Perks you are always free to simply back us with a donation. It is up to you. We are looking forward for your support!  Deutsch 

Weshalb es wert ist, uns zu unterstützen.
Crowdfunding und Perks (als Angebote mit grossen Rabatten im Vergleich zu künftigen Preisen) gehören zusammen. Anstatt unsere Anteile zu veräussern und so unsere eigene Integrität durch institutionelle Anleger zu verlieren, entschieden wir uns, unseren Nutzern Einsparnisse auf unseren Plänen einzuräumen. Dies als Dankbarkeit für deine Unterstützung zu Gründerzeiten! Sei schnell, denn einige Perks sind nur für eine limitierte Anzahl Unterstützer verfügbar. Wir hoffen, dass dir unsere Auswahl von Angeboten für deinen neuen digitalen Lifestyle gefällt! Selbstverständlich ist es auch möglich, uns mittels Spenden zu unterstützen. Die Entscheidung liegt bei dir. Wir freuen uns auf deine Unterstützung und danken dir jetzt schon!
 
  WHAT WE NEED FROM THE CROWDTHE BUDGETThe use of your contributionWe are asking today for fundings of $ 25k USD. Yes, we can develop with that. We already invested many times the amount we ask for and will need your fundings for the final run and the initial running cost. Hitting the goal and getting more funds will allow us to include more features and go faster in the multilingual challenge. So help us getting there and your reward will be amazing!  Deutsch 

Die Verwendung von deiner Unterstützung.
Mit unserem Projekt erhoffen wir einen Betrag von 25'000 USD einzunehmen. Ja, damit können wir Software entwickeln. Bisher haben wir allerdings bereits ein Vielfaches davon ausgegeben und benötigen die Unterstützung für die Fertigstellung sowie die anfänglichen Kosten im Betrieb. Wenn wir über das Ziel hinausschiessen, können wir weitere Funktionen schneller integrieren, so zum Beispiel mehrere Sprachen von Anfang an anbieten. Hilf uns, unser Ziel zu erreichen und das was du bekommen wirst, wird grossartig sein!
 
  OUR TIMELINETHE PROGRESSWork, sleep, eat repeat.Since the beginning, we all violated any existing form of normal human behavior and worked day and night for this particular moment, honor our work, share our vision and be among the first Travialists on the lonely planet.  Deutsch 

Arbeiten, Schlafen, Essen und von vorne.
Von Anfang an liessen wir sämtliche existenten Formen normalen menschlichen Verhaltens hinter uns, arbeiteten Tag und Nacht für diesen einen Moment. Wir hoffen, du schätzt unsere Arbeit, teilst unsere Vision und gehörst zu den ersten Travialists auf diesem Planeten.
 
  WHO WE ARETHE FOUNDING TEAM 
Jan DubsFounder and Brain of TravialistHe has a new idea every five minutes and aims for perfection. But the issue is the ideas are good. When we thought about a pre-release he stopped us, because Travialist is not simply a magazine or travel guide, it is the all in one solution we present you today.


 

Reto LuscherCo-Founder and Multimedia TalentNo matter if an image is moving or not, Reto is the one who got the eye for it. His experience and skills are unmatched and help us to be different. His laughing simply makes you happy, even after 48 hours it still works!


 

Mehul NaharCo-Founder and Chief Software EngineerWhen it comes to Geographical Information Systems and clean code, Mehul is the one we trust. Calling him our bible he is the one who spends sleepless nights, since the beginning in London, thinking about how to implement our vision in executable code.

  Thank you for your time!We hope you enjoy the spirit and vision of Travialist as much as we do. Help us back this campaign an be part of the Travel Revolution. You may choose what ever Perk you like or simply donate an amount you wish. We are happy about your contribution and are looking forward to meeting you on Travialist!  Deutsch 

Wer wir sind.
Jan Dubs Gründer und Hirn von TravialistAlle fünf Minuten hat er eine neue Idee und strebt Perfektion an. Das einzige Problem? Seine Ideen sind gut! Als wir über eine Teilveröffentlichung nachdachten, stoppte er uns. Travialist ist nicht bloss ein Reiseführer, ein Magazin oder ein Reiseplaner, nein, es ist die komplette Lösung die wir dir heute präsentieren!
Reto Luscher Mitgründer und MultimediatalentEgal ob es sich um bewegte Bilder oder Fotografie und Design handelt, Reto ist der Mann mit dem Auge dafür. Sein Erfahrungsschatz und seine unvergleichlichen Fähigkeiten helfen uns, anders zu sein und uns abzuheben. Sein fröhliches Lachen muss dich einfach glücklich machen, selbst nach 48 Stunden arbeiten funktioniert es noch!
Mehul Nahar Mitgründer und leitender Software EntwicklerWenn es um geographisch basiert Informationssysteme und sauberen Code geht, so vertrauen wir auf Mehul. Wir nennen ihn unsere Bibel, er leidet unter vielen schlaflosen Nächten, da er seit London damit beschäftigt ist, unsere Vision in ausführbaren Code zu schreiben.
Danke für deine Zeit! Wir hoffen, du kannst dich mit unserer Vision und Travialist identifizieren, genauso wie wir. Gerne darfst du dir einen Perk aussuchen oder uns mit einer Spende unterstützen. Wir freuen uns über jede Unterstützung und vertrauen darauf, dich bald auf Travialist zu sehen!
 
  WHAT MIGHT INTEREST YOUFAQSimply click on the question to reveal the answer. If you whish to ask us anything else, feel free to contact us bellow.  Deutsch 

Wie kann ich euch kontaktieren?
Du findest unsere Details unten. Du kannst uns entweder ein Telegram senden, oder uns eine Mail schreiben.
Wie viel Reiseführer könnt ihr abdecken?
Wir haben in unserer Datenbank mehr als 9000 Städte mit total mehr als 20 Millionen Points of Interest. Des Weiteren bekommst du mehr als 500 kuratierte Reiseführer direkt in der Applikation. Folge uns auf Instagram wo wir täglich Orte posten, die wir mit Travialist anbieten können.
Was ist der Unterschied zwischen Freebie und euren Premiumplänen (Explorer, Travialist)?
Als Freebie kannst du Travialist gratis nutzen, aber mit eingeschränkter Funktionalität. Die Reiseführer (Explore) werden nur online verfügbar sein. Im Trip Bereich ist es leider nicht möglich deine Flüge kostenlos zu integrieren und so herauszufinden, ob der Flug verspätet ist, an welches Gate du musst, etc. Im Magazin wirst du die Artikel nur auszugsweise lesen können. Podcasts sind da leider nicht verfügbar. Unser P2P Sharing können wir dir als Freebie leider nicht anbieten, da auch wir die damit verbundenen Kosten tragen müssen. Wir empfehlen dir uns heute zu unterstützen. So viel sparen wie heute wirst du nie wieder können!
Der  Explorer Plan  ermöglicht es dir, Daten offline auf deinem Smartphone zu speichern. So bist du nicht auf eine aktive Datenverbindung angewiesen. Die profitierst von einer einfachen Flugintegration im Tripplaner und dem P2P Sharing. Im Magazin erhältst du pro Monat zehn Artikel mit dem dazugehörigen Podcast.
Mit dem  Travialist Plan  bekommst du unsere Vision direkt auf dein Smartphone. Du profitierst von allen Vorteilen des Explorer Plans und kannst deinen Flugstatus direkt abrufen, an welches Gate musst du? Bist du verspätet oder wurde gar dein Flug gestrichen? Im Messenger stellen wir dir ein weiteres Verifizierungs- und Verschlüsselungslayer bereit und du hast natürlich uneingeschränkten Zugriff auf unser Magazin und dessen Archiv. Und nun das wichtigste: Du bekommst den Stealth Mode. Du wirst Travialist anonym nutzen können und wie ein Stealth Flugzeug unsere Plattform überfliegen können. Teile, suche oder checke ein, ohne dass Datenanalyse betrieben wird. (Selbst wenn wir dies anonym tun, im Stealth Mode haben auch wir keine Möglichkeit dies zu tun!) Worauf wartest du noch? Hol dir deinen Lifetimeplan, welcher nur hier auf Indiegogo verfügbar ist. Nachdem das Crowdfunding beendet ist, wird es dazu keine Gelegenheit mehr geben!
Wieso nutzt ihr nicht einfach Werbung auf eurer Plattform?
Gute Frage! Einfache Antwort: Eine attraktive Werbefläche bedingt eine gewisse Reichweite. Mit anderen Worten, viele kaufwillige Nutzer. Wir denken eher daran eine Businesslösung in der Zukunft zu integrieren, welche dir als Nutzer attraktive und relevante Angebote bietet, als Kopfhörer, Pfannen und Schuhe durch Werbung anzubieten. Es gibt für uns zwei Schlüsselfaktoren: Erstens legen wir den Fokus auf das Nutzererlebnis und deine Privatsphäre. Wir möchten dir ein unvergleichlbares soziales Netzwerk mit Reiseapplikation anbieten, das nun mal halt seine Kosten hat. Zweitens, wenn wir Tools von Dritten zu Werbezwecken einbinden stellt dies erneut ein Risiko für deine sicher und private Nutzung der Plattform dar. Mit anderen Worten: Wir sind jung, in einem umkämpften Markt und brauchen dich als Nutzer, da du überlegst bevor du handelst.
Kann ich mehrere Perks erwerben?
Ja, das geht und darfst du natürlich sehr gerne!Bitte beachte aber, dass die Kreditkartenlösung von Indiegogo dies allerdings nicht in einem Durchgang erlaubt. Wenn du mehrer Perks erwerben möchtest, musst du lediglich jeden zu erwerbenden einzeln kaufen.Weitere Informationen findest du hier im Indiegogo Support Bereich.
Wie kann ich einen Perk erweben?
Schau dir die Liste der Perks auf der rechten Seite an (oder unten auf dem Handy). Wenn du einen Perk gefunden hast, der dir gefällt, brauchst du diesen nur anzuklicken um mit dem Prozess weiterzumachen. Weitere Informationen findest du im Indiegogo Support Bereich.
 
Für allgemeine Fragen zu Indiegogo besuch doch das Indiegogo Support Portal.
 
  How can I contact you? You can find our contact below. You can either Telegram us or leave us an e-mail at hello@travialist.com.  How many cities do you cover? We cover more than 9000 Cities around the globe consisting of more than 20 million Points of interest. We do have as well more than 500 curated destinations available. Follow us on Instagram to find out what cities we cover, we post updates daily!  What is the difference between Freebie and your paid plans (Explorer, Travialist)? As a Freebie you can use Travialist for free but with limited functionality. The Travel Guides (Explore) will only be available online.In the Trip section, you cannot integrate your Flights. In the Journal you can preview the excerpt of our journalist content, but have not access to whole issue. Our patent-pending P2P Sharing in the social part is not possible as Freebie as this is cost intensive process. We recommend you contributing today to our campaign and claiming your Perk. As much savings will never be possible again!The  Explorer Subscription allows you to store all the data for your particular trip on your phone. You benefit from flight integration right in your trip planer. Furthermore you can benefit from our vision of your digital privacy by using our  P2P Sharing  functionality. In the Journal you have access to ten articles including their podcast.With the  Travialist Subscription you receive our vision directly in your pocket. You benefit from all the Explorer features plus real time flight integration, so you know whether you are delayed or not; get another layer of  private encryption  in the messenger and have unlimited acces to your Journal and its archive.Well, there is on thing more: You get the Stealth Mode. With respect to your privacy, performance may suffer (suggestions may not be accurate as we cannot identify your key with an analytics file) but you will be  anonymous. Like a Stealth Aircraft, you can sail our Platform, visit, share and search without any analytics performed on your interaction. What are you waiting for? Our  lifetime subscriptions are only available on Indiegogo, after our crowdfunding ends, you will never ever have the chance to get one?  Why don't you just advertise? Good one! Advertisement requires a certain reach, in other words lots of users. We think about integrating a business solution in the future, but there are two key elements: First, let's focus on the user experience and privacy. We would like to offer you an unmatched private social travel network which runs at certain costs. Second: We do not like to integrate with any third party as this will be another potential threat to your privacy. When we develop such a thing, we would allow placements that have nothing to do with you as a user. As you surely can imagine, this requires lots of budget. So for short: we are young, competing on a solid ground backed by the user community.  Can I claim multiple Perks? Yes you can!Pleased note that Indiegogo only allows one Perk per transaction. If you would like to claim multiple perks, please make a new contribution for each Perk.To find our more visit Indiegogo's dedicated Support Area.  How do I claim a perk?

<div>My name is Travis , I run a small online store and currently host weekend camping trips. From 2014-2016 I've hosted 7 events stretching from Pennsylvania to Nevada with over 400 attendees total.  Past activities have included hiking, camping out, dirt biking, target shooting, fire side cooking, and the fun of being outdoors.  </div>

<p></p>
</div>
<div>With your help Arkadia Ranch will be a 4 day weekend event, that we can all enjoy year after year.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need From You.</h3>
<div>We need more than just your money, we need your passion.  I'll be honest, we can't build the future on hopes and wishes alone, we need your help funding this venture.  $7000 is a lot of money but it can build the basics we need. That's including the price of lumber, hardware, heavy equipment rental, and other misc costs. There's a long list of improvements and additional upgrades for the property, but amount of we raise will determine what we can build. </div>
<div>The past events had to be kept small as the only land available was at public campgrounds, target ranges and leased land.   For years its been a dream of many to have a permanent location large enough to host one of the biggest outdoor events that spans across dozens of hobbies.  We now have 80 acres in Nevada to create the biggest, best festival imaginable , but only you can help build it. <br/>

<div>
<br/><h3>What You Get Out Of It?</h3>
<div>Well, at the heart of it, everything.  Most of you have heard of large gatherings like Burning Man or Wasteland Weekend.  What if you could help build an event like that, but with your hobbies and interests in mind?  Imagine a place where you go ride horses, dirt bikes, atvs, do target shooting with a 50cal rifle, legal fully automatic firearms, camp out under the stars, enjoy a campfire cooked meal, and much more all at the same event.  You're not just investing in a one time event, you're paving the way for a party you can enjoy for years to come. </div>
<div>If we meet our goal here we'll build you a shooting range, with backstops, berms, firing lanes, awnings for shade, benches and tables for gear and seating, a campsite, parking lot  and a few other surprises.  Make it past the $7000 and we can start talking about dirt bike tracks, a modest horse corral, and reactionary/moving targets for the range.  If we don't reach the goal we'll build as much we can with the funds raised. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We're Building Together</h3>Arkadia isn't just about having fun, it's a learning experience.  A place where you can share your hobbies with others, and learn new ones.  Ever wanted to learn how to ride a horse, drive a dirt bike, shoot a gun, or even just how to set up a tent and ""rough it"" outdoors?  Your support can help build the framework for an event that dedicated enthusiasts can share with new comers wanting to join them in their interests.  Looking to get a friend or family member involved in your hobby?  Helping build Arkadia will give you a place to do just that. </div><div>Over the last 3 years I've seen close bonding and new friendships spring up at every event I've hosted.  People have brought family members and friends along and given them their first taste of a new experience which they never knew they loved before hand.  I've personally had the pleasure of meeting hundreds of amazing people and I want to extend that opportunity to you.</div><div>

Built from Necessity and First-Hand Experience 

""I learned to sew during cancer treatment. It was a great creative outlet for me at a time when I needed it the most.""
 

WANAKA was founded from a need for a better daypack. From sewing the first prototype to working with the best manufacturers, this brand has evolved from life events that have shaped who we are. For us, WANAKA and our gear reflect the passion for taking advantage of every opportunity, embracing the unknown, and experiencing wild places. We produce quality gear, captivating content, and give our customer something that will last forever.
 

Months of designing and refining, a trip halfway across the world, and 11 prototypes later... we nailed it


We spent weeks abroad meeting with different manufacturers until we found the perfect fit. From there, we produced sample after sample, testing dozens of different material and hardware combinations. We got closer and closer with each prototype. 11 prototypes later, we nailed it!

TRIED TESTED AND TRUE
From there, we tested the backpack in every way possible: hiking, biking, trail running, canyoneering, rock climbing, ski touring, air travel, bus travel, river trips, mountaineering, bouldering, and more. It was tested in the harshest of conditions during the most rigorous activities. It blew away all of our expectations.

 

We tested dozens of different fabrics, buckles, and zippers throughout 11 different prototypes. We didn't cut any corners with quality or durability. Top of the line material is used all throughout the WANAKA Adventure Pack.

The Best Materials and Hardware Were Used All Throughout This Pack

The Inflatable Frame Allows The Bag To Pack Small While Still Offering Support And Weight Distribution

Most packable daypacks are uncomfortable to carry. We designed our pack with a custom inflatable airframe, that distributes weight for increased comfort and stability
 

ZIP OFF AND GO
The top of the pack zips off and can be worn as a fanny pack or sling. The fanny pack is perfect for traveling. The sling function, coupled with our three contact system and hydration bladder, is perfect for bike rides, hikes, and trail runs. 

The Top Of The Pack Zips Off And Can Be Used As A Sling Or Fanny Pack

Explore a new city, keep your valuables at your fingertips, or throw in your keys, phone, and a bar and get lost in the mountains

 

PROTECT CAMERA GEAR... OR KEEP A BREW COLD
We spent a lot of time working with different protective foams and insulation to make sure the camera case would protect your gear and keep food and drinks cold. 

The Camera Case Perfectly In The Lower Compartment Of The Pack And Double As A Cooler
 
FOR WHEN YOUR ADVENTURES GET ROWDY
Our custom fit dry bag will keep your gear safe from the elements on your adventures.  


COOLER FUNCTION

Keeps ice frozen for up to 8 hours

MOST PACKABLE DAYPACKS TAKE UP SPACE... OURS SAVES YOU SPACE
The ability to deflate the backpack frame allows the backpack to function as a compression sack. Simply pack your soft goods and compress to save precious packing space.


 

Most Packable Day Packs Take Up Space. Ours Saves You Space.
 
ENTIRE PACK FITS INTO TOP COMPARTMENT FOR TRAVELING
 

 

Our integrated laundry bag helps you stay organized while traveling and is a great place to store dirty clothes. It also fits perfectly in the 24L backpack so you can compress and pack your dirty clothes.

<p>We love adventuring outdoors with friends and family. We also <em>love</em> hammocks, but traditional hammocks are limited to where you can use them.</p>
<p>This is the problem we set out to solve after many frustrating (and treeless) camping adventures in the amazing deserts of southern Utah.</p>
<p>Our goal was to design a portable solution that would allow outdoor adventurists to use their hammocks anywhere in the world. Whether it be a desert, beach, music festival, hotel balcony, bedroom, or your <em>very own backyard</em>.</p>
<p>As development began, we discovered many hammock-lovers shared the same problems we faced such as unpredictable weather, storage needs, bugs and animals. This gave us the idea of putting a protective tent around a relaxing hammock. And so, the <strong>Tammock </strong>was born. You can now take your hammock adventure <em>anywhere</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Not a tent. Not a hammock. It's a TAMMOCK.</strong></p>

We love adventuring outdoors with friends and family. We also love hammocks, but traditional hammocks are limited to where you can use them.
This is the problem we set out to solve after many frustrating (and treeless) camping adventures in the amazing deserts of southern Utah.
Our goal was to design a portable solution that would allow outdoor adventurists to use their hammocks anywhere in the world. Whether it be a desert, beach, music festival, hotel balcony, bedroom, or your very own backyard.
As development began, we discovered many hammock-lovers shared the same problems we faced such as unpredictable weather, storage needs, bugs and animals. This gave us the idea of putting a protective tent around a relaxing hammock. And so, the Tammock was born. You can now take your hammock adventure anywhere.
Not a tent. Not a hammock. It's a TAMMOCK.

 
TAMMOCKS SET-UP IN DIFFERENT WAYS...
The Tammock is completely freestanding which allows you to hammock absolutely anywhere.
 
Versatility is built into The Tammock frame. Use it with or without the tent.
 

 
SUPER EASY SET-UP


 


 


 


DOUBLE ZIP OPENINGS FOR TWICE THE VIEW
Double-Zip Doors improve the views.
WATERPROOF RAINFLY
Waterproofing provides a comfortable shelter in unpredictable weather.
STORAGE POCKETS
Storage pockets keep everything within reach.
 
Additional storage above is perfect for lights and other accessories.
CARRY BAG
The Tammock packs away into a carry bag.

<ul><li>Please click or tap the <b>Subtitle/CC</b> feature in the YouTube Settings and select <b>English (United Kingdom) - Peini</b> when watching the video.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><b>WHAT
IS PEINI?</b></p>
<p>Peini
means “Gift” in Dagbani, a major language in the northern part of Ghana spoken
by the people of Dagbon. It is a 100% natural skin-care brand made from Coconut
Oil, Olive Oil and its primary wonder material, Premium Grade A SHEA BUTTER. It
is nature’s special Gift to the skin. This is what the American Shea Butter Institute
has to say about Shea Butter:</p>
<p><b>“Vitamin A in Shea Butter
is important for improving a number of skin conditions, including blemishes
wrinkles, eczema, and dermatitis. Additionally, Premium Shea Butter cream has
properties to treat skin allergies, insect bites, sunburns, frostbites, and a
number of other conditions of the skin. Shea Butter’s unparalleled moisturizing
property is due to several natural moisturizers present in the cream. The
moisturizers in Shea Butter are the same moisturizers produced by the sebaceous
glands in the skin. If you buy the concept that the skin sebaceous glands
produce moisturizers for the skin, then it’s no wonder that Shea Butter is such
a superior moisturizer.”</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1231943/files/20150218143204-First.jpg?1424298724"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p></p>
<p>The American Shea Butter
Institute also lists the following 21 as reasons to use Shea Butter:</p>
<p><b>1. Dry skin<br/>
2. Skin rash<br/>
3. Skin peeling, after tanning<br/>
4. Blemishes and wrinkles<br/>
5. Itching skin<br/>
6. Sunburn<br/>
7. Shaving cream for a smooth silky shave.<br/>
8. Small skin wounds<br/>
9. Skin cracks<br/>
10. Tough or rough skin (on feet.)<br/>
11. Cold weather,<br/>
12. Frost bites<br/>
13. Stretch marks prevention during pregnancy<br/>
14. Insect bites<br/>
15. Healthy skin<br/>
16. Muscle fatigue, aches and tension<br/>
17. For before and after strenuous exercise<br/>
18. Skin allergies such as poison ivy or poison oak<br/>
19. Eczema<br/>
20. Dermatitis<br/>
21. Skin damage from heat (Hot grease while cooking, radiation treatment for
certain medical problems, etc.)</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Institute’s responds
to the question,<b> “Who should use Shea Butter?” </b>is:
</p>
<p><b>“Everyone! Every household should have a jar of Shea Butter, either
among the beauty supplies for soft smooth better looking skin, or in the
medicine cabinet for minor skin injuries around the house. SHEA BUTTER IS THE
SKIN’S BEST FRIEND!”</b></p>

<p>
</p><p><b>WHAT WE ARE ALL ABOUT</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>We are a human-centered
business, creating an engaging environment for all staff to feel a part of the
Peini story. We believe in adding value to the lives of individuals directly
and indirectly involved in the entire value chain of all our products. We offer
all our staff free accommodation with meals and a compensation package that
enable Peini feel like a family worth belonging to.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>We are an environmentally-friendly
and socially responsible brand, we source our raw materials from the Widows’
Shea Butter Co-operative in Tamale and Bolgatanga, the two largest cities in the north of Ghana. The
Shea Butter is bought from the Co-operative on fair-price basis. Members of the
co-operative are given direct support by Peini to boost their production
capacity enabling them earn higher revenue from the Shea Butter they produce.
Essentially, the women in the Co-operative are an integral part of the
company’s value chain process.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
DO SO FAR</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Peini has been producing
a range of Skin Care products on a small scale as part of Research &amp; Development and we are
now ready to go commercial, sharing this precious gift with the world.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>We have been able to
conclude laboratory R&amp;D for Shea Butter and other natural-based massage
oils and therapeutic treatment products. It is currently in the market testing
phase.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>We have almost concluded
laboratory R&amp;D for Peini’s Hair Care products range and would need support
to conclude and begin the market testing phase.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>POTENTIAL</b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Apart from Skin Care,
Peini has the potential to produce a range of natural Hair Care products</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Peini has concluded Laboratory
Research &amp; Development into Shea Butter/other natural-based massage oils
and therapeutic products for physiotherapy and spa treatments.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The Pharmaceutical
prospects of Shea Butter and other fats and oils provide Peini with
overwhelming opportunities. Skin regeneration and other dermatological uses as
well as hygiene products and pain medication are some of the possibilities
Peini intends to explore.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>GOAL</b></p>
<p>Our
goal is to move from our Research &amp; Development/Market Testing/Small-scale
Production phase to commercial-scale production so we can share nature’s
wonderful gift to the skin with the world.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>HOW
MUCH DO WE NEED?</b></p>
<p>In
order to scale up production, we will need a minimum of <b>US$200,000</b>.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT
WILL THE MONEY BE USED FOR?</b></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>US$150,000 will go into
the procurement, shipping, installation and testing of additional machinery and
equipment with the lowest carbon footprint to enable Peini to scale up
production. This will also allow Peini to apply for ISO and Rainforest Alliance
Certifications.</p>
<p>ISO
and Rainforest Alliance Certifications mean we have the most environmentally
responsible supply chain process. This feeds into an excellent production process that
ensures our gift to you is of the highest quality and our environment is protected from harm.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>US$15,000 will be used to
support the Widows’ Co-operative in Tamale and Bolgatanga to procure equipment to further
mechanize the production of the Shea Butter from the nut. This will
tremendously increase their capacity (by about 60%) and enable them supply
Peini without a hitch. </p>
<p><span>·<span>  </span></span>Our products have been tested by Africa's leading research rentre, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, and have regulatory approvals from Ghana's Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) and the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA). However, we want to share this
gift with as many countries and economic regions of the world as would be
possible, therefore, US$25,000 will go into testing, certification, regulatory
approvals and licensing for specific countries and regions.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>US$10,000 will go into completing
Research &amp; Development for Peini’s Shea Butter based line of Hair Care
products.</p><p><br/></p><p>
</p><p><b>DIRECT
EMPLOYMENT</b></p>
<p>Achieving
the goal set for this campaign will mean that Peini can employ 15 young people
directly, particularly in the logistics aspect of the business. Employing them
will mean their accommodation, food and clothing will be taken care of by
Peini, in addition to fair salaries. </p>

IS PEINI?
Peini
means “Gift” in Dagbani, a major language in the northern part of Ghana spoken
by the people of Dagbon. It is a 100% natural skin-care brand made from Coconut
Oil, Olive Oil and its primary wonder material, Premium Grade A SHEA BUTTER. It
is nature’s special Gift to the skin. This is what the American Shea Butter Institute
has to say about Shea Butter:
“Vitamin A in Shea Butter
is important for improving a number of skin conditions, including blemishes
wrinkles, eczema, and dermatitis. Additionally, Premium Shea Butter cream has
properties to treat skin allergies, insect bites, sunburns, frostbites, and a
number of other conditions of the skin. Shea Butter’s unparalleled moisturizing
property is due to several natural moisturizers present in the cream. The
moisturizers in Shea Butter are the same moisturizers produced by the sebaceous
glands in the skin. If you buy the concept that the skin sebaceous glands
produce moisturizers for the skin, then it’s no wonder that Shea Butter is such
a superior moisturizer.”



The American Shea Butter
Institute also lists the following 21 as reasons to use Shea Butter:
1. Dry skin
2. Skin rash
3. Skin peeling, after tanning
4. Blemishes and wrinkles
5. Itching skin
6. Sunburn
7. Shaving cream for a smooth silky shave.
8. Small skin wounds
9. Skin cracks
10. Tough or rough skin (on feet.)
11. Cold weather,
12. Frost bites
13. Stretch marks prevention during pregnancy
14. Insect bites
15. Healthy skin
16. Muscle fatigue, aches and tension
17. For before and after strenuous exercise
18. Skin allergies such as poison ivy or poison oak
19. Eczema
20. Dermatitis
21. Skin damage from heat (Hot grease while cooking, radiation treatment for
certain medical problems, etc.)



The Institute’s responds
to the question, “Who should use Shea Butter?” is:

“Everyone! Every household should have a jar of Shea Butter, either
among the beauty supplies for soft smooth better looking skin, or in the
medicine cabinet for minor skin injuries around the house. SHEA BUTTER IS THE
SKIN’S BEST FRIEND!”
The Gifts from Peini include:
1.  Shower
Gels
2.  Body
Lotions (Fragranced)
3.  Body
Lotions (Fragrance-free)
4.  Hand
Creams
5.  Hotel-size
Hand Creams

Repellents

WHAT WE ARE ALL ABOUT
· 
We are a human-centered
business, creating an engaging environment for all staff to feel a part of the
Peini story. We believe in adding value to the lives of individuals directly
and indirectly involved in the entire value chain of all our products. We offer
all our staff free accommodation with meals and a compensation package that
enable Peini feel like a family worth belonging to.
· 
We are an environmentally-friendly
and socially responsible brand, we source our raw materials from the Widows’
Shea Butter Co-operative in Tamale and Bolgatanga, the two largest cities in the north of Ghana. The
Shea Butter is bought from the Co-operative on fair-price basis. Members of the
co-operative are given direct support by Peini to boost their production
capacity enabling them earn higher revenue from the Shea Butter they produce.
Essentially, the women in the Co-operative are an integral part of the
company’s value chain process.
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
DO SO FAR
· 
Peini has been producing
a range of Skin Care products on a small scale as part of Research & Development and we are
now ready to go commercial, sharing this precious gift with the world.
· 
We have been able to
conclude laboratory R&D for Shea Butter and other natural-based massage
oils and therapeutic treatment products. It is currently in the market testing
phase.

· 
We have almost concluded
laboratory R&D for Peini’s Hair Care products range and would need support
to conclude and begin the market testing phase.
POTENTIAL
· 
Apart from Skin Care,
Peini has the potential to produce a range of natural Hair Care products
· 
Peini has concluded Laboratory
Research & Development into Shea Butter/other natural-based massage oils
and therapeutic products for physiotherapy and spa treatments.
· 
The Pharmaceutical
prospects of Shea Butter and other fats and oils provide Peini with
overwhelming opportunities. Skin regeneration and other dermatological uses as
well as hygiene products and pain medication are some of the possibilities
Peini intends to explore.
GOAL
Our
goal is to move from our Research & Development/Market Testing/Small-scale
Production phase to commercial-scale production so we can share nature’s
wonderful gift to the skin with the world.
HOW
MUCH DO WE NEED?
In
order to scale up production, we will need a minimum of US$200,000.
WHAT
WILL THE MONEY BE USED FOR?

· 
US$150,000 will go into
the procurement, shipping, installation and testing of additional machinery and
equipment with the lowest carbon footprint to enable Peini to scale up
production. This will also allow Peini to apply for ISO and Rainforest Alliance
Certifications.
ISO
and Rainforest Alliance Certifications mean we have the most environmentally
responsible supply chain process. This feeds into an excellent production process that
ensures our gift to you is of the highest quality and our environment is protected from harm.
· 
US$15,000 will be used to
support the Widows’ Co-operative in Tamale and Bolgatanga to procure equipment to further
mechanize the production of the Shea Butter from the nut. This will
tremendously increase their capacity (by about 60%) and enable them supply
Peini without a hitch. 
·  Our products have been tested by Africa's leading research rentre, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, and have regulatory approvals from Ghana's Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) and the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA). However, we want to share this
gift with as many countries and economic regions of the world as would be
possible, therefore, US$25,000 will go into testing, certification, regulatory
approvals and licensing for specific countries and regions.
· 
US$10,000 will go into completing
Research & Development for Peini’s Shea Butter based line of Hair Care
products.
DIRECT
EMPLOYMENT
Achieving
the goal set for this campaign will mean that Peini can employ 15 young people
directly, particularly in the logistics aspect of the business. Employing them
will mean their accommodation, food and clothing will be taken care of by
Peini, in addition to fair salaries.

<p>The patent pending Little Pinch More is the first 6 proto types ever manufactured and now displayed with a movie demonstration and pictures on this project that have an overwhelmingly successful results because of my experience gathered while designing and manufacturing fine detailed titanium ideas, similar to jewelry craft.</p>
<p>The machine hours with the high quality EDM wire cutting work shop including the high quality CNC machining work shop is 3 hours for each Little Pinch More that is manufactured direct from 8mm Gr5 titanium plate.</p>
<p>I have also invented the patent pending Carabiner Split Second Key Ring for the perfect match that is offered as an add on reward.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479526551/qwgncdth0i1z028pg86y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My latest invention Gr5 Titanium key ring accessory called the ""Little Pinch More""  is almost unnoticeable on a key ring that has compact items such as EDC tweezers, fingernail file and clippers, electrical wire cutter an strippers with philips and flat screw drivers, two  size leavers, knife, scissors, bottle and can opener with hidden features such  as a wrench to undo boat trailer shackles and much more.</p>
<p>The Gr5 titanium strength and light weight structure is skin friendly, 100% rust proof, none magnetic, also an item neatly tucked away in a survival kit for when a disaster strikes.</p>
<p> The ""Little Pinch More"" is the perfect gift that will  ""WOW"" the receiver, as the little things can mean a lot.</p>

<p>The Little Bit More Gr5 titanium scissors are designed to compete with the convention nail clippers that are too bulky for key rings, unattractive and rust, the Little Pinch Mores combination of tweezers with a blade on each inside of the tweezers allows left and right hand operation usage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480130680/cmt6r7pwqrt2xc1h9eox.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Little Pinch More is also designed to compete with conventional tweezers that have sharp edges, bulky, rust and not suited for key rings, the Little Pinch More tweezers are folded into a small structure the size of  6mm X 6mm X 36mm, and is surgical friendly</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480130975/qco5kq3drmnglrcehmm0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The Little Pinch More hole that holds the key ring is used to cut heavy duty three phase electric wire without damaging the cutter blade edge, the wire is placed through the hole and then a weight is pressed down on top of the wire side into the main structures blade that acts as a guillotine to neatly cut the three phase wire,  also the wire plastic surrounding can be rotated around in the hole against the blade in the main structure that cuts the plastic surrounding to allow the electrical cable to be wire stripped.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480134322/l4imtyijvlmav2stxvjj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The little Pinch More tweezers can have a small screw placed in the end of tweezers, the screw driver part automatically presses the top of screw firmly so the screw can be placed and screwed into holes hard to get at.</p>

<p>5 Best EDC Multi Tool Gadgets You Must Have !  </p>
<p>Gadget Inspiration</p>
<h3> </h3>
</div></div>","About this project

The patent pending Little Pinch More is the first 6 proto types ever manufactured and now displayed with a movie demonstration and pictures on this project that have an overwhelmingly successful results because of my experience gathered while designing and manufacturing fine detailed titanium ideas, similar to jewelry craft.
The machine hours with the high quality EDM wire cutting work shop including the high quality CNC machining work shop is 3 hours for each Little Pinch More that is manufactured direct from 8mm Gr5 titanium plate.
I have also invented the patent pending Carabiner Split Second Key Ring for the perfect match that is offered as an add on reward.
 

My latest invention Gr5 Titanium key ring accessory called the ""Little Pinch More""  is almost unnoticeable on a key ring that has compact items such as EDC tweezers, fingernail file and clippers, electrical wire cutter an strippers with philips and flat screw drivers, two  size leavers, knife, scissors, bottle and can opener with hidden features such  as a wrench to undo boat trailer shackles and much more.
The Gr5 titanium strength and light weight structure is skin friendly, 100% rust proof, none magnetic, also an item neatly tucked away in a survival kit for when a disaster strikes.
 The ""Little Pinch More"" is the perfect gift that will  ""WOW"" the receiver, as the little things can mean a lot.
 

The Little Bit More Gr5 titanium scissors are designed to compete with the convention nail clippers that are too bulky for key rings, unattractive and rust, the Little Pinch Mores combination of tweezers with a blade on each inside of the tweezers allows left and right hand operation usage.
 

The Little Pinch More is also designed to compete with conventional tweezers that have sharp edges, bulky, rust and not suited for key rings, the Little Pinch More tweezers are folded into a small structure the size of  6mm X 6mm X 36mm, and is surgical friendly

The little Pinch More is designed to have a small knife neatly unfold from inbetween the tweezers which is also a leaver and flat screw driver.
 

The Little Pinch More has a compact bottle opener designed to fold out of the structure and combine the tweezers as a leverage to open cap.

The Little Pinch More tweezer with the combined main structure become scissors to cut electrical cord appliances items as well as wire strippers.

The Little Pinch More hole that holds the key ring is used to cut heavy duty three phase electric wire without damaging the cutter blade edge, the wire is placed through the hole and then a weight is pressed down on top of the wire side into the main structures blade that acts as a guillotine to neatly cut the three phase wire,  also the wire plastic surrounding can be rotated around in the hole against the blade in the main structure that cuts the plastic surrounding to allow the electrical cable to be wire stripped.

The little Pinch More tweezers can have a small screw placed in the end of tweezers, the screw driver part automatically presses the top of screw firmly so the screw can be placed and screwed into holes hard to get at.

The Philips screw driver can have added leverage when the main structure is unfolded for extra torque on the screw fixture

The Little Pinch More flat screw driver can have added torque to undo tight screw fixture when the main structure is unfolded,  for extra torsion the tweezers can also fold out to assist as an extra leaver bar on the screw fixture

 
The Little Pinch More combination knife flat screw driver part can also be used as a lever to pry open can lids  

The Little Pinch More tweezers also can be used as a larger lever which has the knife blade part between the tweezers to act as a laminated titanium metal structure that gives it a superior structure strength.

The Little Pinch More knife part also is good for prying open small objects like the small plug in the picture above that covers the screw hole or remove staples or open soft drink cans without damaging finger nails

The Little Pinch More is so small it can be used as a zipper handle for suit cases, tool bags or clothing zippers.
  

The little Pinch More is handy when wanting to pick or trim flowers

The Little Pinch More scissors can cut strong strapping that is used to secure cardboard packaging.

 
The Little Pinch More scissors have a scalloped region to allow the finger nail close the cutting edge also because the blade is on both sides this allows right hand and left hand usage.  

 
The Little Pinch More scalloped teeth region act as a gripping handle for when used as a screw driver or knife, especially if oil or grease is on the hands, most of all is a very good fingernail file. 

The Little Pinch More can be used as a wrench to undo shackles, such as on a boat trailer that the shackle pin may have rusted in place, or to secure the shackle pin tight, making sure the shackle pin will not undo when in use.

 
The Little  Pinch More when combined with the Carabineer Split Second Key Ring for added leverage on knife part, is used as a can opener 

 
The Little Pinch More is the perfect match for the Carabineer Split Second Key ring for when one will want to remove quickly and use the Little Pinch More without the Carabineer Split Second Key Ring attached that the Short movie below demonstrates quickly removing the Little Bit More and the keys.

Risk and challenges
The manufactures procedures are in order to start manufacturing which I personally supervise, including the detailed sanding, polishing and laser welding.
The challenge was to make the Little Pinch More, high quality, compact and unique to combine everyday use items on a key a ring that would justify the 3 hours machining time cost and hand craft finishes.
Over time for the last two years I have formed a close team relationship with the EDM and CNC work shop owners in China which the CNC workshop manufacture super fine mold tooling for watches and  jewelry,  the  EDM wire cutting work shop is the best I have  seen for manufacturing fine structures  during a time of over 12 years’ developing  inventions  China.
I have allowed 6 months to manufacture and to mail rewards which this time is needed for the start of the first production run hence the machining hours, sanding and polishing time.

If you come to Prague do you want to wander around without knowing where to go? 
Do you want to spend your few precious days by visiting places which are overpriced but well-presented in popular tourist guides and where only foreigners spend their time?
Do you want to see the real Prague or only touristic attractions? Do you want to see Prague the same way we - who have been living here for a long time – see it?
      

Alternative Guide Written by Local Guy
Tony’s Alternative Guide through Prague is an independent project which offers you tips for the best places in Prague which you should see when you stop by. We pointed out for you the most authentic venues with great genius loci.

We visited all the places by ourselves that’s why we really know what we are talking about! No one paid for being advertised; it is all based on our personal opinions. Most of the photos are unique, took specially for this guide. Because Antonin, author of the guide, is a photographer.  What Is in the E-Book?The Alternative Guide through Prague takes you to places where it lives! To places where new ideas pop up every minute and where the amount of creativity overwhelms you.



Over 130 places – cafes, bars, pubs, music clubs, galleries, cultural and experimental venues, modern art, parks, cinemas, technical monuments, museums and much more
All-over-a-year list of different types of festivals
Tips for original adventures

Our city has been changing a lot lately. Now you can find here emerging alternative communities and Prague becomes more cosmopolitan. New co-working places are opening, local workrooms are being built and charming cafes with tables and stools in front of their entrances are becoming very popular among locals. Pop-up galleries, bistros with home-made food or local products from Czech farmers are gaining more and more popularity as well. Now it is the only time when you can experience this change with us!

   

 


The Only Authentic Guide to Prague You Were Waiting For
We’ll help you to find the nicest cafes, very typical Czech pubs or the most unique music clubs. You’ll see where modern art, contemporary theatre or so called new cirques come to life. And when you are tired we’ll tell you which parks and public gardens offer the best place for your rest. On a blanket with bottle of wine, if you wish.Tony's Guide will take you to the most unique small art cinemas in Prague where all the movies are being screen in the original language version.

Who Is Behind the Project?


My name is Antonin Jelinek, I was born and raised in Prague and due to my passion for the not-so-obvious places I have been exploring my country and its amazingly beautiful capital of Prague for as long as I can remember.
I have lived here as student, full-time employee and freelancer as well so I know the city from different angles.
This guide book is my hobby on which I focus in my free time. Otherwise I’m webmaster and photographer. My girlfriend Inka helps me with the guide book when she is not in her office working with Roma (Gypsies) in an NGO or producing cultural events. While bringing foreign bands in Prague we realized how difficult it is for them to find cool local places.
Also while traveling in my free time I have always thought about electronic guide book like the one I’m working on, which would help me to get to know the local enviroment as fast as possible.  But I have never found one. That is why I decided to make one for others who could appreciate it as much as I would.


 

What I Need? Why I need your help?The Guide Book is ready but only in the Czech language. Unfortunately my knowledge of English is not sufficient enough to translate it by myself. But I study hard and try to improve.
That is why I need to collect some money for professional translation. The Guide Book offers more than 130 places on 170 pages which means a lot of time and work for some translator. After the translation also proofreading must be done so you can enjoy the whole Guide Book while going through it.

This is a follow on campaign from our Kickstarter campaign (<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/246632126/fogo-adventure-gadget-walkie-talkie-gps-flashlight"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>). We sold about 450 units on Kickstarter and are looking to give the Indiegogo community a great deal on the Fogo before we introduce retail pricing. We are building 1000 units in the first batch arriving in January, and you will get yours even if we don't meet our goal. This campaign is the last chance to pre-order the Fogo. Thanks!</i><br/></span></p>

<p>One of the most exciting features of the Fogo is the SmartCap interface. The SmartCap is an end cap on the Fogo that comes off with a simple twist and allows you to do many things, including:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Charge the Fogo using standard USB chargers </li>
<li>Charge other battery-powered devices </li>
<li>
<b>Add hardware capability</b> such as the Walkie-Talkie SmartCap </li>
</ul>
<p>More SmartCaps are in the works, including a <b>satellite modem, laser range finder and avalanche beacon. </b>These future SmartCaps will allow all Fogo users to add these capabilities! </p>

<p>Fogo has an upgradeable app-based OS. You can load apps on the Fogo using the Fogo Hub.  The following apps will come pre-installed on the Fogo.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442958922/rvshkhsl4ktme4t2njpt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Activity  </b>The Activity app allows you to track your ride, run, or hike using the built-in GPS. You can also see real-time metrics like speed, distance, and travel time. When riding at night, the Fogo can automatically adjust light brightness based on speed. It can also switch automatically between road mode (flashing) and trail mode (solid).</p>
<p><b>Clock</b>  The Clock app provides basic watch functionality including a stopwatch, timer, and alarm.</p>
<p><b>Compass</b>  The Compass app gives you a magnetic heading using the tilt-compensated ecompass.</p>
<p><b>Flashlight</b> The Flashlight app gives you classic flashlight modes such as low, medium, high and strobe.</p>
<p><b>Maps</b> The Maps app allows you to view simple maps as well as navigate from waypoint-to-waypoint. At night, the flashlight can automatically blink to keep you on course. The light will also adjust automatically based on whether you are looking at the ground in front of you (low-beam) or at objects in the distance (high-beam).</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>This has been an amazing journey for us, and we are excited to get the Fogo into your hands. The most important part of this project is delivering a great product to our backers!</p>
<p>We have worked hard on the Fogo and leveraged our personal experience as product designers to produce a sound design and solid user experience. As engineers, we have first hand experience with the many risks and challenges in bringing a hardware project to fruition. Our promise to you, our backers, is to tirelessly apply our obsessive attention to detail and hard earned experience in manufacturing to overcoming the hurdles.</p>
<p>We have approached this project conservatively and added padding to our delivery schedule to allow for the unknown unknowns. We promise to keep you up to date on our progress during and after the campaign. Rest assured that we are working hard to deliver a high quality product to you on time.</p>
<p>We are excited to get the Fogo out on the trail and helping you enjoy the outdoors!</p>
<p>Thanks! <br/>Team Fogo</p>
<br/>
</div></div>","Hi. This is a follow on campaign from our Kickstarter campaign (here). We sold about 450 units on Kickstarter and are looking to give the Indiegogo community a great deal on the Fogo before we introduce retail pricing. We are building 1000 units in the first batch arriving in January, and you will get yours even if we don't meet our goal. This campaign is the last chance to pre-order the Fogo. Thanks!
Meet Fogo, the only gadget that includes GPS, bluetooth, voice and text messaging, a USB backup battery, a powerful LED flashlight and much MORE! Have peace of mind knowing you have all these safety features wherever you go. 
With a bulit-in GPS and walkie-talkie, the Fogo allows you to do things you couldn't do before, like automatically sending a message to your friends if you are in need of help. Fogo can also control the flashlight with the GPS to help you find your way home in the dark. Whether you're biking or hiking, fishing or hunting, navigating or camping, the Fogo keeps you safe and lightens your load.
Help bring the Fogo into the world by backing this project today!















Whether you're at the campsite or on the hunt, the Fogo is there for you.




Light up the campsite if you need to set up your tent after dark 







Keep track of your friends and family with Fogo’s location sharing and get alerts if the kids have strayed from the campsite








Send out a text message so everyone can be back in time for marshmallows 
Use the Fogo to send text messages from your smartphone when you are off the grid (no towers, routers or satellites required)




Chat with friends or family who are away from camp with the Walkie-Talkie 




Easily find the Fogo in a dark tent using the motion-sensor feature 





Charge up your USB devices in your tent, using the Fogo as a backup battery





Get off the beaten path and keep safe while exploring.



Using the GPS and built-in pedometer, track your steps and route so you know how far and where you've gone




Navigate waypoints to find your trail or points of interest

Create waypoints on the fly for spontaneous geocaching




Use the Automatic light control to save battery life and protect your night vision (point to the ground for dim and far away for bright) 




Easily navigate terrain at night--the Fogo will warn you if you are getting off course by blinking the light




Uphill, downhill, or cross country, the Fogo was made to ride.


Track your speed, distance, elevation, rate of ascent/decent and see your stats on the Fogo or download to Strava after your ride

Share locations with your riding buddies and get real time alerts when someone is falling behind, getting too far ahead or stopped





Track your heart rate or cadence to maximize your output using the Fogo's bluetooth connectivity

See your friends' heart rate and let your friends see your heart rate; great for training or making sure you don't wear anyone out too early in the ride

Chit chat with your buddies, during your ride, to communicate directions, give inspiration or hints on the trail




Ride into the night with automatic brightness adjustment based on speed and ambient light 




Have peace of mind with the Fogo's crash detection feature which automatically alerts your friends if you need help











One of the most exciting features of the Fogo is the SmartCap interface. The SmartCap is an end cap on the Fogo that comes off with a simple twist and allows you to do many things, including:  

Charge the Fogo using standard USB chargers 
Charge other battery-powered devices 

Add hardware capability such as the Walkie-Talkie SmartCap 

More SmartCaps are in the works, including a satellite modem, laser range finder and avalanche beacon. These future SmartCaps will allow all Fogo users to add these capabilities! 












Weight: 0.44lbs(198g) / 0.56lbs(255g) with batteries
Click here for more in-depth specifications




Fogo includes the following accessories: 

Lanyard 
Belt Clip
GoPro Mount Adapter - compatible with all GoPro mounting accessories


The Fogo also includes your choice of reflector (add $15 to your pledge to get both): 

Narrow Beam (66 degree cone angle)
Wide Beam (82 degree cone angle)






Fogo has an upgradeable app-based OS. You can load apps on the Fogo using the Fogo Hub.  The following apps will come pre-installed on the Fogo.


Activity  The Activity app allows you to track your ride, run, or hike using the built-in GPS. You can also see real-time metrics like speed, distance, and travel time. When riding at night, the Fogo can automatically adjust light brightness based on speed. It can also switch automatically between road mode (flashing) and trail mode (solid).
Clock  The Clock app provides basic watch functionality including a stopwatch, timer, and alarm.
Compass  The Compass app gives you a magnetic heading using the tilt-compensated ecompass.
Flashlight The Flashlight app gives you classic flashlight modes such as low, medium, high and strobe.
Maps The Maps app allows you to view simple maps as well as navigate from waypoint-to-waypoint. At night, the flashlight can automatically blink to keep you on course. The light will also adjust automatically based on whether you are looking at the ground in front of you (low-beam) or at objects in the distance (high-beam).
Maps can be created using online hiking or biking sites (bikemap.net or Google Earth).  You can also convert Activity tracks to Maps.
Messages The Messages app allows you to send voice and text messages to other Fogo users. You can also view the messages on a map which shows the sender's location.

Because we are all about rainbows and unicorns, Author of Pain has made earrings to match. They are made from hand painted ceramic unicorns from Stone Mountain Bead Gallery.  (When she bought them the store owner asked what she was making, when he heard it was for roller derby he was like, ""You're so petite. Really? Roller Derby?"" She gets that a lot.)

<p>For one, hardly any of us know what we want to be ""when we grow up,"" which means we end up doing majors and taking jobs that don't fire us up on the insides. That sucks. It's painful. And it leaves us sad and confused and not sure what to do to get fulfillment from life. </p>

<p><strong>WHAT WE DO</strong></p>
<p>We’re not a tour. We’re a little bit different: we’re a shared rental. </p>
<p>Imagine sharing a road trip with 9 other backpackers, travelling along red dirt roads, and stopping at waterfalls and gorges as you like. Making your own decisions. You’ve got everything you need for camping, cooking and fun and every night you camp and enjoy a meal together (and a few cheeky drinks) under amazing starry skies. The stars are so good because there’s no light from any cities around in the middle of nowhere.</p>
<p>This is us, Share Bus. We help travellers like you go on flexible, affordable, self-guided camping road trips.  We rent out our minibus and trailers full of camping, (glamping) and cooking equipment to a group of backpackers to do road trips. The start and end dates are fixed, but the route is totally flexible!</p>

<p><strong>WHAT WE ARE RAISING FUNDS FOR</strong></p>
<p>We want to take our next step and create a 4WD set-up.</p>
<p> We want to help you travel to more remote places; the real famous Australian places like along the Gibb River Road in Northern Western Australia. Or to the very best waterfalls in Kakadu National Park.</p>
<p>However, we need a 4WD vehicle and off-road trailer.</p>
<p>And a 4WD that can carry a large group is a big expense for us. So we'd like to invite you to help us 'Share the Bus' by contributing something and receiving one of our perks (which include highly discounted trips!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>We are Marco and Jade, plus a few helpers around the country who prepare the bus for the trips, and help us promote Share Bus. We started Share Bus about a year and a half ago, with our old 1999 Toyota Hiace ""Betty"". </p>
<p>Now Betty is being retired, and we have upgraded to 3 much newer Toyota Hiace, and learnt all the lessons that come with running a business for its first year.</p>
<p>We are both travellers ourselves. Marco is Italian and first came to Australia in 2012 on a working holiday Visa. After a lot of hard work he managed to get sponsored and stay in Australia as an engineer, but now works on his own projects, like Share Bus and running hostels in Perth. Jade is from Perth, Australia and spent a lot of time travelling after finishing university. After trying lots of different things after getting home she now works full time on building Share Bus, and teaches piano on the side.</p>
<p>Why did we start Share Bus? I guess we thought there was a better way. We think young travellers today are looking for ways to be more independent and flexible, than going on a tour. We thought we could help them do that in a way that still provided what they needed, and allow them the opportunity to travel in a group. </p>

<div>We developed the Tow Bike to solve four main issues that people have when they want to transport a motorcycle:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Loading a motorcycle onto a normal trailer using ramps is difficult and dangerous.</li>
<li>Most people do not have sufficient space to store a motorcycle trailer, especially in densely populated areas like The Netherlands</li>
<li>A motorcycle trailer with ground level loading is expensive.</li>
<li>Buying a motorcycle trailer means that you have to go out to a store, it will never be sent to you in a box.</li>
</ol>
<div><h3>How it all began</h3></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>I enjoy racing motorcycles with friends over week-ends, and we always have the same problem - how to transport race bikes to the tracks. Then my wife and I have another problem, how to take a large tent/supplies/water and the bicycles with us on holiday.</p>
<p>You see, we use bicycles a lot in Holland - and the country is also very densely populated, so real estate is precious. If we bought a trailer to transport either motorcycles, bicycles or camping gear, where would we put it?</p>
<p>I discussed these issues with a friend of mine that is an Industrial Designer - he has previously designed race related vehicles...we did some research too, and we discovered that my Honda CBR actually has the same length as my friend's Audi A3's width!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462690528/geplakte_afbeelding_1238_x_955_nl6tpu.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So we thought about designing a motorcycle trailer where the bike sits sideways. You won't need a frame or a floor, so that you can just lift it by the draw bar and lean it against the wall! Once the storage problem solved, and the motorcycle problem solved too, we realized that we actually have enough space on the back of it for 200kg of supplies and a large tent.</span><br/></p>

</div><div> <p>All the funds that we raise will be used to set up series production of the Tow Bike. We will not use the funds for personal consumption because the members of our team still have other incomes.</p>
<p>What we offer our backers is an innovative and well prized product that is intended for the road transport of a scooter, a medium sized motorcycle, bicycles, camping equipment and supplies. </p>
<p>Innovative because there is no motorcycle trailer on the market that offers ground level loading of your motorcycle and also allows you to take 200 kg of supplies (tent, tools, parts, food &amp; beverage etc) with you.</p>
<p>But if you do not have a motorcycle, you can use the Tow Bike to load 4 mountain bikes and take 200 kg of supplies for a nice weekend in the woods.</p>

<p>This instant storage compact trailer has a HUGE loading

boards (not longboards), a generator, food, water, a barbecue etc. When you get
to your destination and unpack, just flip the trailer up against a tree or a
wall to get it out of the way. There is no other trailer on the market that
offer you these options, including the sideways ground loading feature.</p>
<p>For example, say you transport a motorcycle to a mate that lives downtown.
If you show up with a tow bike, not only you can easily offload the bike, but
when you're done then you can lean the trailer against a wall or tree on the sidewalk

market does this.<br/><br/></p>

<p><strong>Will I get my cloud plan activated as soon as I get the first beta?</strong></p>
<p>Not yet, the first beta version won't include cloud plans, but it's pretty likely we'll introduce them during the beta period at a further beta release.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any estimated date for the delivery of the public version?</strong></p>
<p>We'll start distributing the beta version in December, and plan to get to the App Store by January.</p>
<p><strong>What's the future roadmap for Meridian?</strong></p>
<p>We have plenty of ideas to make Meridian amazing! The best part about the concept is its versatility, which allows us to think and focus about expanding to many other platforms, such as the web.</p>
<p><strong>Other than contributing, how can I help?</strong></p>
<p>Even if you are not backing Meridian but like the project anyway, you can spread the word about Meridian via Twitter, Facebook, email, etc. You can find the share links at the top of this page.</p>

We'll start distributing the beta version in December, and plan to get to the App Store by January.

<p><u><strong>Changing the way travellers collect their special memories </strong></u></p>
<p>We wanted to design a solution to address a major pain point for travellers around the world of how to best preserve their travel memories. We combined the longevity of a journal with the simplicity of a souvenir. </p>

<h3>Why we started Storyteller</h3>
<p><strong>Storyteller</strong><strong> was started with three main objectives:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) To build the best travel accessories using environmentally friendly materials.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Inspire more people to travel the world (we LOVE to travel!)</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Fund educational projects for individuals in underprivileged areas of the world.</strong></p>
<p>Travelling allows us to witness some incredible sights, taste the most amazing food and create special memories that will always stay with us. It is also one of the best teachers outside of the classroom and helps so many of us grow as individuals. </p>
<p>Although travelling the world shows us so many positives, it also shows us the world’s biggest problems. Recent UNESCO figures show that there are 750 million youth and adults who are unable to read and write a simple sentence. </p>
<p>This not only has long-term consequences for those individuals affected, but also for the next generation, who become part of a repeat cycle of inequality and poverty.</p>
<p>At Storyteller, we are passionate about wanting to make a real change to this problem and to do this, we have partnered with like-minded charities to work with and help fund educational projects for both children and adults in less privileged areas of the world. </p>
<p>Our charity partners are <strong>The Barefoot College </strong>(work in 93 countries worldwide), <strong>Global Citizen</strong> (worldwide) and <strong>The Hope Foundation</strong> (work in India, Kolkata).</p>

<p>It is our vision at Storyteller to inspire people to travel more but also bring together passionate travellers from around the world in unity with a mission to do good. </p>

<h3>The Storyteller Team</h3>
<p>Now you have learned about Storyteller and FlagMate, we would like to take a moment to introduce you to the minds behind the company.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520130500/pagrge4zwdh6sf1e4qco.jpg"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>The founder of Storyteller is Bhav Patel. Having practiced as a Lawyer for many years, he has led many Corporate Social Responsibility programmes, which has allowed him to work closely with large charities and understand the technical details of how the sector operates. He has since put this knowledge into practice by becoming an integral member of the UNICEF, NextGen, London team.</p>
<p>When Bhav first had the idea about creating FlagMate, he wanted to ensure that the company stood for two values that he was most passionate about, his love for travel and giving back to those less fortunate. He wanted to showcase the positives of travel, but also use this platform to show the educational problems around the world and create a community of like-minded people to come together and help resolve these problems. He says:</p>
<p>“Travelling the world has allowed me to see and meet so many adults who are completely illiterate. That is when it clicked. It was a repeat cycle, children could not obtain a quality education, and they were then growing as adults who were completely illiterate. I wanted to make a change and so made a conscious decision to ensure that an integral part of Storyteller would be to focus on a mission to do good, and help fund and run educational workshops for both children and adults.” </p>
<p>The Storyteller team has since grown with like-minded individuals from backgrounds in law, branding, marketing, fashion and product design and the charity sector. </p>
<p>Although we all have our own expertise, we all have two things in common, the love of travel and the passion to do good.</p>
<h3><strong>Responsibly and Ethically Sourced </strong></h3>
<p>At Storyteller, we are passionate about using environmentally friendly and sustainable materials for our products. From the printing of our clothing to the materials used in our products and packaging, we use the best progressive and sustainable materials. Some of the materials we use include recycled card, plant-based materials, and non-PVC polyurethane microfibre.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520155067/tyvuk34kg4a2tps8qrar.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Our Product and Development Story</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Storyteller FlagMate </strong></p>
<p>Once we settled on the concept of FlagMate, we began to design and develop a product which was durable and able to go through all types of weather. </p>
<p>Together with our design team, we created the prototype of FlagMate and the Flags, and then gave them to 10 different individuals to test, for a period of three months.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520116060/ilzznjbbem5q6jird1gr.jpg"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520116110/q4goz9vh4xgktgmbzilf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The feedback was great, but the two issues raised were that the design wasn't very appealing and second, the flags were hitting against the faux leather at the bottom, causing wear and tear. To improve the design and strengthen the product, we added a nickel plated metal block to create an innovative design and importantly, separate the faux leather from the flags, reducing any wear and tear. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520116288/ahmkkju9ea4izcy4ykn7.jpg"" src=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520116491/vbkkgn6dop9tpsvmjfqs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We rounded off the FlagMate by using cross coloured stitching and embossing our favourite, passport style stamped logo into the high-quality faux leather.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520004295/cgcrkwgijsgbgioncygs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Finally, we added an option to have a clip, which was durable and able to hold a large number of flags. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520004394/kzijv584g4rcnsrgdkcw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Storyteller Flags </strong></p>
<p>When we first created the Flags, they were computer printed. However, when we got the first look, there was something missing, it was the personal touch. We, therefore, enhanced the Flag in two different ways.</p>
<p>The flags were changed from computer print to each one individually created. The flag designs are drawn into a piece of metal after which they are each hand-painted one by one. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520130793/b4qo5wb34wj5bw8bw72l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The other enhancement we made was to laser add the option to laser engrave a special message to the back of each Storyteller Flag. The perfect way to capture your special memories.</p>
<p><strong>Bamboo Tees</strong></p>
<p>After sampling hundreds of tees, we finally found the perfect material, a mix of organic cotton and bamboo which is quick dry, wind resistant, comfortable and long-lasting in both material and style.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520128623/vco6ehsijy9cjw4btrwl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The bamboo is ethically sourced from China where it is pressed and crushed mechanically before being sent to India where it is produced sustainably creating the perfect tee for every traveller!</p>

<p>Our manufacturers are able to deliver within 4 months of this crowdfunding campaign ending and therefore at the latest, we aim to start shipping orders by 30 August 2018. If we surpass our funding goals substantially, we may need some extra time to fulfill orders. If this is the case we will update each and every single one of you with a new time frame.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Over the last eight months, we have continuously developed our products and are super proud of the results. As with any product going into production, there are risks, but we have worked hard to minimise these. For example, production delays, which we have allowed for in our timeline. </p>
<p>We will be as open as possible with you throughout the rest of the project and beyond, posting regular updates (here and on facebook and twitter) every step of the way.</p>

<h3>FAQS</h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>1) Refunds and Exchanges</strong></p>
<p>Although we cannot offer refunds on the Storyteller FlagMate or Storyteller World Flags, we are able to offer an exchange on our bamboo tees for customers in the UK only.  </p>
<p><strong>Please note</strong> that all international sale are final, i.e. we can not accept returns or exchanges for any items. </p>
<p>For refunds during the campaign, this can be processed, through Indiegogo provided the campaign is live and not ended, the perk claimed has not been fulfilled, and the funds have not been transferred to Storyteller. </p>
<p><strong>2) Who is responsible for international import, duties, VAT, and customs fees?</strong></p>
<p>You are responsible for any extra fees that may be applied when shipped to/arriving in your country. This includes international import, duties, VAT, and customs fees. </p>
<p><strong>3) Are you a charity or a full profit company?</strong></p>
<p>We are a full profit company with a positive conscience. We give from our profits as we believe doing good is integral. We do, however, partner with registered charities who we fund to run educational programmes around the world. We are just doing our bit and hope you will join us in doing yours too.</p>
<p><strong>4) How do I tell you which Storyteller Flags and Engraving I require?</strong></p>
<p>Get your list ready and we will be in contact after the campaign has ended with a questionnaire for you to send this information<strong> </strong>across to us. That way if you have any trips between now and April you can get those flags in advance too!</p>
<p><strong>5) I want to buy individual additional flags in addition to these perks, can I do this?</strong></p>
<p>As our prices are based on an overall discounted bundle, the prices for individual Storyteller Flags are slightly higher (<u>but still discounted from our RRP price of £6.99</u>) at a cost of £4.99 each. </p>
<p>If you have purchased a <u>bundle with over 25 Storyteller Flags, </u>we will discount each additional Flag to £3.49 each. </p>
<p>To purchase, simply work out the price and contribute this through the ""Make a Contribution"" part in the perk box and send us an email at hello@storytellertravel.co.uk advising of your purchase. </p>
<p><strong>6) What size Storyteller Bamboo T-shirts do I need? </strong></p>
<p>They are unisex t-shirts and they come in Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large. </p>
<p>We do however advise that you buy a size which is slightly smaller than your normal size as these t-shirts are comfort fit and therefore are slightly bigger than normal UK/EU size t-shirts.  For men, if you are a medium fit, and you want a slightly fitted look, we recommend buying a small size. For women, if you are a size 8/10 we recommend a size small tee. </p>
<p><strong>7) Are the FlagMates and Storyteller Flags water resistant?</strong></p>
<p>We have done our best to create an item which will work through storms and rain hit areas when you are travelling. Having tested the product, although it will withstand water and simply dry out, we highly advise to keep it in the best condition, not to let it soak in water or stay in wet weather for very long.</p>
<p><strong>8) How can I upgrade my perk?</strong></p>
<p>Please contribute the difference through the ""Thank You"" Perk and send us an email at hello@storytellertravel.co.uk advising of your upgrade. </p>
<p><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>9) </span>Do you ship worldwide?</strong></p>
<p>We ship to most countries, with some exceptions due to regulatory restrictions outside of our control. In the next step you can select your country and see the shipping cost related to that country. </p>
<p><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>10) When will you ship and when will I get my Storyteller products?</span></strong></p>
<p>The Indiegogo campaign is due to end on 1 April 2018. Once we have collated all of the orders, we will work with our manufacturers to start production with a date of 30 August 2018 to obtain and post out all of your fantastic products! We are based in the UK and therefore, orders within the UK and EU will take around 5-7 days, for orders worldwide please allow a slightly longer period (we believe this is approximately 2-3 weeks). </p>
</div></div>","FlagMate features
Crafted in the UK using environmentally friendly faux leather and solid metals, to ensure it can travel through all of your adventures. Each FlagMate holds up to 30 Flags. 

Available with a clip to attach anywhere you like... (Length 13.5cm x 2.7cm width)

Also available without a clip to use as an elegant and stylish keyring (Length 8.5cm x 2.7cm width)

The Storyteller Flags are custom made and individually hand-painted, with an elegant smooth finish.  

With the added option to personalise the back of each flag using up to 36 characters. 

If you prefer not to personalise your Flag, we will simply add the name of the country on the back (if you're like us and can't remember each country flag this will be useful!)

Use it to share your travel stories with other travellers. 

 
Changing the way travellers collect their special memories 
We wanted to design a solution to address a major pain point for travellers around the world of how to best preserve their travel memories. We combined the longevity of a journal with the simplicity of a souvenir. 

HOW IT WORKS
1. CHOOSE THE STORYTELLER FLAG OF EACH COUNTRY YOU HAVE VISITED OR ARE GOING TO VISIT

2. AN OPTION TO ADD A SPECIAL MESSAGE, MEMORY OR DATE ON THE BACK OF THE FLAG. IF NOT, WE WILL SIMPLY ADD THE NAME OF THE COUNTRY ON THE BACK
3. ADD THE STORYTELLER FLAG TO YOUR FLAGMATE 

 
Why we started Storyteller
Storyteller was started with three main objectives:
1) To build the best travel accessories using environmentally friendly materials.
2) Inspire more people to travel the world (we LOVE to travel!)
3) Fund educational projects for individuals in underprivileged areas of the world.
Travelling allows us to witness some incredible sights, taste the most amazing food and create special memories that will always stay with us. It is also one of the best teachers outside of the classroom and helps so many of us grow as individuals. 
Although travelling the world shows us so many positives, it also shows us the world’s biggest problems. Recent UNESCO figures show that there are 750 million youth and adults who are unable to read and write a simple sentence. 
This not only has long-term consequences for those individuals affected, but also for the next generation, who become part of a repeat cycle of inequality and poverty.
At Storyteller, we are passionate about wanting to make a real change to this problem and to do this, we have partnered with like-minded charities to work with and help fund educational projects for both children and adults in less privileged areas of the world. 
Our charity partners are The Barefoot College (work in 93 countries worldwide), Global Citizen (worldwide) and The Hope Foundation (work in India, Kolkata).

It is our vision at Storyteller to inspire people to travel more but also bring together passionate travellers from around the world in unity with a mission to do good. 

We hope you will support and join us on this journey of empowerment as together, we can make a difference.

The Storyteller Team
Now you have learned about Storyteller and FlagMate, we would like to take a moment to introduce you to the minds behind the company.
 
The founder of Storyteller is Bhav Patel. Having practiced as a Lawyer for many years, he has led many Corporate Social Responsibility programmes, which has allowed him to work closely with large charities and understand the technical details of how the sector operates. He has since put this knowledge into practice by becoming an integral member of the UNICEF, NextGen, London team.
When Bhav first had the idea about creating FlagMate, he wanted to ensure that the company stood for two values that he was most passionate about, his love for travel and giving back to those less fortunate. He wanted to showcase the positives of travel, but also use this platform to show the educational problems around the world and create a community of like-minded people to come together and help resolve these problems. He says:
“Travelling the world has allowed me to see and meet so many adults who are completely illiterate. That is when it clicked. It was a repeat cycle, children could not obtain a quality education, and they were then growing as adults who were completely illiterate. I wanted to make a change and so made a conscious decision to ensure that an integral part of Storyteller would be to focus on a mission to do good, and help fund and run educational workshops for both children and adults.” 
The Storyteller team has since grown with like-minded individuals from backgrounds in law, branding, marketing, fashion and product design and the charity sector. 
Although we all have our own expertise, we all have two things in common, the love of travel and the passion to do good.
Responsibly and Ethically Sourced 
At Storyteller, we are passionate about using environmentally friendly and sustainable materials for our products. From the printing of our clothing to the materials used in our products and packaging, we use the best progressive and sustainable materials. Some of the materials we use include recycled card, plant-based materials, and non-PVC polyurethane microfibre.

Our Product and Development Story
The Storyteller FlagMate 
Once we settled on the concept of FlagMate, we began to design and develop a product which was durable and able to go through all types of weather. 
Together with our design team, we created the prototype of FlagMate and the Flags, and then gave them to 10 different individuals to test, for a period of three months.
 
The feedback was great, but the two issues raised were that the design wasn't very appealing and second, the flags were hitting against the faux leather at the bottom, causing wear and tear. To improve the design and strengthen the product, we added a nickel plated metal block to create an innovative design and importantly, separate the faux leather from the flags, reducing any wear and tear. 
  
We rounded off the FlagMate by using cross coloured stitching and embossing our favourite, passport style stamped logo into the high-quality faux leather.

Finally, we added an option to have a clip, which was durable and able to hold a large number of flags. 

Storyteller Flags 
When we first created the Flags, they were computer printed. However, when we got the first look, there was something missing, it was the personal touch. We, therefore, enhanced the Flag in two different ways.
The flags were changed from computer print to each one individually created. The flag designs are drawn into a piece of metal after which they are each hand-painted one by one. 

The other enhancement we made was to laser add the option to laser engrave a special message to the back of each Storyteller Flag. The perfect way to capture your special memories.
Bamboo Tees
After sampling hundreds of tees, we finally found the perfect material, a mix of organic cotton and bamboo which is quick dry, wind resistant, comfortable and long-lasting in both material and style.

The bamboo is ethically sourced from China where it is pressed and crushed mechanically before being sent to India where it is produced sustainably creating the perfect tee for every traveller!


We even tested them to make sure they were very very wind resistant…

We will be announcing stretch goals very soon, but if we hit our target of £5,000.00 we will be able to this FlagMate variation:

Timeline

Our manufacturers are able to deliver within 4 months of this crowdfunding campaign ending and therefore at the latest, we aim to start shipping orders by 30 August 2018. If we surpass our funding goals substantially, we may need some extra time to fulfill orders. If this is the case we will update each and every single one of you with a new time frame.
Risks and challenges
Over the last eight months, we have continuously developed our products and are super proud of the results. As with any product going into production, there are risks, but we have worked hard to minimise these. For example, production delays, which we have allowed for in our timeline. 
We will be as open as possible with you throughout the rest of the project and beyond, posting regular updates (here and on facebook and twitter) every step of the way.

<p>My brother and I have taken the reigns to our families farming business. A business that struggled for many years due to unforeseen difficulties of the agriculture industry that our family-faced.

Millions of people use plastic containers and plastic bags to transport toiletries every day. Tens of billions of plastic toiletry containers end up in waste landfills every year. This needs to change if we are to save our planet from pollution. GoBout helps solve this crisis by offering a convenient, comprehensive way of reusing travel size bottles. You simply refill your capsules at home and store them in our beautiful housing dispenser. GoBout comes in two sizes: Large and small. For the large version, there are five capsules. Each capsule is less than 100ml or 3.4 ounces, which means at some airport security checks, you just have to remove the capsules from the main body. For the small version, there are four capsules. In total, the small version carries less than 100 ml or 3.4 ounces. You don't need to remove capsules from the main body because it complies with air travel rules.  The biggest challenge in designing GoBout was achieving simplicity. How should the user select different products to dispense? How do we avoid accidental leaks? How to refill empty canisters in the most efficient and environmentally friendly way possible? We researched every conceivable dispensation method: Aerosal, compressed air, vacuum, etc.In the end, we achieved all of our goals without sacrificing function or form. The final GoBout design is a simple, elegant solution to a real problem. A simple design means less complexity, better user experience, and less opportunity for malfunction. 
Here is a video of our first working prototype. 


Here are some of our earliest sketches!
   Over the past 7 months, we have been hard at work preparing to bring you the world's best portable multi-dispenser. We truly believe that this is the future of traveling more with less while also helping the environment.  We can't wait for you to be the first to get your hands on the GoBout. Feel free to check out our rewards. Thank you so much for your support, and hey just Go Be Out with GoBout, the world's best portable multi-dispenser.",23.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>I am Brian Filko, a mechanical engineer/entrepreneur from Pennsylvania. I have carried many different types of multitools on my keychain over the years and have always been frustrated when tightening and loosening screws.  The constant lifting and repositioning of these tools/bits to only get a quarter turn makes these multitools impractical for most common fixes. </p>
<div> </div>
<div>I decided to channel my frustrations by designing a multitool featuring a dynamic ratchet so you don't need to lift and reposition the tool between each turn. This saves you time and allows you to use EverRatchet for small and also large fixes. </div>

<h4><b>What Inspired Me to Create this Revolutionary
Device?</b></h4>
<p>Everyone more or less suffer from memory lapses. For my wife, it is
especially serious. She always forgets to take the keys! Tried many
kinds of tracker, but still lockout herself some times, because the Trackers
really can’t work as Door-Reminder. So I think, “Why not invent a smartest
device for her? Let her go out with ease”. That’s Alger, the First in the
world!</p>

<h3><b>How Alger Works?</b></h3>
<p>Alger is a ""Never Lost"" Technology that works with your
phone using its existing motion sensors and a dedicated Alger App. This means even without additional accessories, Alger can remind you taking the phone!</p>
<p>Add our Smart Anti-Lost ‘Tag’ to your keys or other things and Alger
will remind you about that too.</p>

you no longer need to worry about Lockout. Place Alger on your door
and it will remind you about your belongings as you are leaving your house.And, you needn't worry about losing your stuff anywhere, Smart Anti-Lost is the upgraded Tracker.
What Inspired Me to Create this Revolutionary
Device?
Everyone more or less suffer from memory lapses. For my wife, it is
especially serious. She always forgets to take the keys! Tried many
kinds of tracker, but still lockout herself some times, because the Trackers
really can’t work as Door-Reminder. So I think, “Why not invent a smartest
device for her? Let her go out with ease”. That’s Alger, the First in the
world!
                                 Busy works, Suffering from OCD,  Forgetfulness
How Alger Works?
Alger is a ""Never Lost"" Technology that works with your
phone using its existing motion sensors and a dedicated Alger App. This means even without additional accessories, Alger can remind you taking the phone!
Add our Smart Anti-Lost ‘Tag’ to your keys or other things and Alger
will remind you about that too.
""Never Lost"" smart sensor technology replace Bluetooth signal strength detecting.  More Exact, No error alarm!

Phone Bluetooth
Step 2: Easily stick Alger on your Door  or take it down within a few seconds!


Step 3: Tie your most important items to the Smart anti-lost Tag. For
example, your keys, your wallet, or even your pets!Now, whenever you open the door, Alger System will alert you with
Flash and Beep if you have left anything behind. How could Alger system know whether or not
you have your keys with you when you walk out the door?                                                                                  There is a motion sensor in Smart Anti-Lost tag that you need to
simply chain it with your keys. So, if you leave home without them, Alger knows
and lets you know! Our Proprietery Technology Whose Preciseness is Unmatched!Some Other Applications of Smart Anti-LostJust like any other Tracking device, Smart Anti-Lost works anywhere, has all the required and useful features such as lost alert, tracking in GPS map, finding each other and more, but, it's smarter as mentioned. It is ""Never Lose"" technology, the WORLD'S FIRST Tracker with motion sensor!We can even Laser Mask the text you want on smart anti-lost tag,
such as your Facebook or Twitter ID's, Email address. So, when you lose your keys, there are
two ways you can get them back:

You receive an alert on your
phone whenever your keys are out of range and remember GPS location on your
phone map.                                                                         2)

singer/songwriter before becoming a teacher. I loved being a musician, I
 love teaching (English and History) and I love writing and riding 
motorcycles. <br/><br/>In 2012, the first of my two sons was born. Since then, I've become interested in creating a job for myself that fulfills a few functions, and the first of those is making it possible to work from home in such a way as to maximize time with my boys and my wife. The second function is the kind of job that would allow me to really use the skills I've built up over the years as an entertainer, a writer, and a teacher, and the third function is that I really want my sons to grow up seeing that their papa works hard, works smart, and does the job until the job is done. Thus was Throttle and Torque Motorcycle Tours born.<br/><br/>I'd first conceived of Throttle and Torque Motorcycle Tours back in 2006, 
on my final tour as a musician. I rode around the country with my guitar
 tied to the sissy bar of a Harley Davidson Superglide. I rode over 
12,000 miles, played 38 gigs in 42 days, and raised money for the 
families of children with Cystic Fibrosis. It was an honor and an 
adventure, and all that time inside my helmet got me thinking about what
 is important to so many of us who love motorcycling. <br/><br/>At Throttle and Torque Motorcycle Tours, we want to see (and show you) the world! We want to meet new people, to have fun and experience the  camaraderie that is the inevitable result of spending hours of time in the saddle, experiencing the world in the way Robert Pirsig described it in <i>Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.</i><br/><br/><i><em><em><i>“In a car you're always in a compartment, and because you're used to it 
you don't realize that through that car window everything you see is

What we need is the funding to advertise to the degree necessary to build TTMT into a thriving moto-touring business.<br/><br/>That's where you come in. Like me, you're crazy for riding. Crazy for getting out into the wind and the heat, the open spaces and banked turns and curves. You're insane for the backwoods diners and truckstops and cafes with menu items like ""Eggs and Meat.""

<h2>What inspired me? </h2>
</div>
<p>I'm a Vietnamese who studied in Tourism. I have met numerous international tourists who get lost or confused of what to do in Vietnam - even after they did a lot of research from different websites and books. I realize that although there are many websites about Vietnam tourism, not many of them are written by Vietnamese people. </p>
<p><i>Tôi là một người Việt Nam, tôi theo học chuyên ngành Du lịch. Qua những lần đi đây đó, tôi gặp và trò chuyện với nhiều du khách quốc tế và tôi nhận thấy dường như họ luôn bị bối rối hay ngỡ ngàng về nhiều thứ khác nhau ở Việt Nam – thậm chí là họ đã tìm kiếm thông tin từ vô số website và sách hướng dẫn du lịch. Tôi nhận ra rằng: mặc dù có rất nhiều website về du lịch ở Việt Nam nhưng đa số chúng đều không phải được viết ra bởi người Việt Nam.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514818355/elarfmv4cc7f4xmbbb5v.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We want to create a community by making a website to share information and experience about Vietnam tourism and culture.</p>
<p>The idea of this website is very simple, it is a place where<strong> any visitor can ask any question and get the answer directly from Vietnamese people</strong>. As a team working together, AskVietnamese will become a community to support international tourists in Vietnam. </p>
<p><i>Vì vậy, tôi và team của mình mong muốn tạo ra một cộng đồng cùng nhau chia sẻ thông tin và kinh nghiệm về du lịch và văn hóa ở Việt Nam.</i></p>
<p><i>Ý tưởng hình thành website này rất đơn giản: đây sẽ là nơi để bất cứ du khách quốc tế nào cũng có thể <strong>đặt ra bất kì câu hỏi nào về Việt Nam và nhận được câu trả lời trực tiếp từ chính những người bản địa ở Việt Nam.</strong> Chúng tôi hy vọng AskVietnamese sẽ trở thành một cộng đồng đắc lực hỗ trợ du khách nước ngoài đến Việt Nam.</i></p>

<li><i>Chia sẻ kinh nghiệm, giải đáp thắc mắc của du khách</i></li>
</ul>
<p>International tourists will use AskVietnamese as a platform to find out information about: Places, Travel Tips, Safety, Events, Culture, Souvernirs. These information are confirmed to be authentic and trustworthy.</p>
<p><i>Du khách quốc tế sẽ tìm thấy nhiều thông tin hữu ích và đáng tin cậy về địa điểm du lịch, những hoạt động đặc sắc ở Việt Nam, văn hóa Việt Nam, quà lưu niệm, những “bí quyết bỏ túi” khi du lịch. Thông tin được cung cấp tại AskVietnamese sẽ mang tính bản địa với độ chân thật cao.</i></p>

What inspired me? 

I'm a Vietnamese who studied in Tourism. I have met numerous international tourists who get lost or confused of what to do in Vietnam - even after they did a lot of research from different websites and books. I realize that although there are many websites about Vietnam tourism, not many of them are written by Vietnamese people. 
Tôi là một người Việt Nam, tôi theo học chuyên ngành Du lịch. Qua những lần đi đây đó, tôi gặp và trò chuyện với nhiều du khách quốc tế và tôi nhận thấy dường như họ luôn bị bối rối hay ngỡ ngàng về nhiều thứ khác nhau ở Việt Nam – thậm chí là họ đã tìm kiếm thông tin từ vô số website và sách hướng dẫn du lịch. Tôi nhận ra rằng: mặc dù có rất nhiều website về du lịch ở Việt Nam nhưng đa số chúng đều không phải được viết ra bởi người Việt Nam.

We want to create a community by making a website to share information and experience about Vietnam tourism and culture.
The idea of this website is very simple, it is a place where any visitor can ask any question and get the answer directly from Vietnamese people. As a team working together, AskVietnamese will become a community to support international tourists in Vietnam. 
Vì vậy, tôi và team của mình mong muốn tạo ra một cộng đồng cùng nhau chia sẻ thông tin và kinh nghiệm về du lịch và văn hóa ở Việt Nam.
Ý tưởng hình thành website này rất đơn giản: đây sẽ là nơi để bất cứ du khách quốc tế nào cũng có thể đặt ra bất kì câu hỏi nào về Việt Nam và nhận được câu trả lời trực tiếp từ chính những người bản địa ở Việt Nam. Chúng tôi hy vọng AskVietnamese sẽ trở thành một cộng đồng đắc lực hỗ trợ du khách nước ngoài đến Việt Nam.
 


Thúc đẩy sự hiểu biết của mọi người về du lịch sinh thái
Tạo ra một cộng đồng để giúp đỡ du khách quốc tế
Hỗ trợ những địa điểm kinh doanh nhỏ ở các địa phương bán thức ăn/sản phẩm chất lượng của địa phương đó
Chia sẻ kinh nghiệm, giải đáp thắc mắc của du khách

International tourists will use AskVietnamese as a platform to find out information about: Places, Travel Tips, Safety, Events, Culture, Souvernirs. These information are confirmed to be authentic and trustworthy.
Du khách quốc tế sẽ tìm thấy nhiều thông tin hữu ích và đáng tin cậy về địa điểm du lịch, những hoạt động đặc sắc ở Việt Nam, văn hóa Việt Nam, quà lưu niệm, những “bí quyết bỏ túi” khi du lịch. Thông tin được cung cấp tại AskVietnamese sẽ mang tính bản địa với độ chân thật cao.

Các lĩnh vực của ASKVIETNAMESE:

Thông tin: phương tiện giao thông, thời tiết, chính sách, địa lý, lịch sử
Văn hóa: thức ăn, ngôn ngữ, tín ngưỡng, kiêng kỵ
Du lịch: bài giới thiệu; những lời khuyên, đề xuất hữu ích
Blog: Cảm nhận, suy nghĩ, chia sẻ cá nhân
Sản phẩm sáng tạo: khắc họa văn hóa qua các bức vẽ, hình ảnh động, video/clip…

Sử dụng website của AskVietnamese, du khách quốc tế sẽ tìm thấy nhiều thông tin hữu ích và đáng tin cậy về địa điểm du lịch, những hoạt động đặc sắc ở Việt Nam, văn hóa Việt Nam, quà lưu niệm, những “bí quyết bỏ túi” khi du lịch.

Điều gì làm AskVietnamese khác biệt ? 
+ Sắc đỏ: Đam mê: Truyền cảm hứng để nhiều người “xách ba lô lên và đi” và chia sẻ những trải nghiệm của họ về Việt Nam cho cả thế giới
+ Sắc xanh: Xác thực: Cung cấp những kinh nghiệm đáng tin cậy và sâu sắc về lối sống của người dân địa phương
+ Sắc xanh lá: Thân thiện: Sử dụng ngôn ngữ tiếng Anh đơn giản, dễ đọc, dễ hiểu. Khuyến khích người Việt trẻ luyện tập sử dụng tiếng Anh
+ Sắc vàng: Sáng tạo: Sáng tạo, sáng tạo và sáng tạo! Chúng tôi yêu những hình ảnh động, những bức vẽ, video, graphic… và cố gắng thể hiện chúng nhiều nhất có thể trong những nội dung của mình
+ Sắc cam: Hài hước: Chúng tôi có sự vui nhộn, thư giãn và cả một chút dí dỏm. Mọi người đều thích vui vẻ mà, đúng không?
+ Sắc tím: Hỗ trợ du lịch sinh thái: Tăng cường sự hiểu biết của mọi người về du lịch sinh thái và những ngành du lịch bền vững khác ở Việt Nam
We contact Local Writers from different places in Vietnam, inviting them to join AskVietnamese and encouraging them to share information/experience/feeling about their hometown. We will work to translate their writing from Vietnamese to English if necessary. 
Chúng tôi liên hệ với những Người Viết Bài - là người Địa Phương sinh sống ở nhiều nơi trên khắp đất nước Việt Nam để mời họ tham gia vào AskVietnamsese, cũng như khuyến khích họ chia sẻ thông tin/kinh nghiệm/cảm nhận của họ về quê hương. Chúng tôi cũng tiến hành dịch những bài viết này từ tiếng Việt sang tiếng Anh nếu cần thiết.
