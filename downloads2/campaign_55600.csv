 Our StoryFor years, many have turned to mindfulness and meditation as a way to enhance gratitude, awareness and focus but a majority of us struggle with starting and continuing to practice. Our Founder, Eric, was no different.Eric was a stressed out Software Developer coding on the computer, who without thinking picked up a pen, took off the cap, and started breathing through it. After 15 minutes of this he felt mentally clear and completely relaxed.  He then tried using the pen cap during his Meditation practice and boom, same thing — completely focused and calm. After doing this for a month  Eric says he never felt better and decided to build a device that optimizes breathing mindfully with the world.

<b>Let's talk about Panic Attacks</b>
</div></div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Imagine that you are at
the airport and the check-in of your flight is closing in 15 minutes.
You don't know the airport, your suitcase is enormously heavy, all
the trolleys are taken and the place is overcrowded with thousands of
people. You start running panicky, your pulse increases, you sweat,
your conception of the space is changed and you arrive at the
check-in desk a complete wreck, just in time before it closes. What a
relief you are in! Now, think of this situation but without the final
outcome and the subsequent decrease of your adrenaline, because there would be no concrete stressful situation that demands your alert. If you
succeed in getting into this role you can feel the 1/100 of what a
person who suffers from panic attacks experiences.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445514866/qpaqjwoihmjjztarkruv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Panic attacks occur to
people with different demographics and socials characteristics, so
they represent the torturing reality of many people from different
social backgrounds. It's a common health issue which concerns between
3,5% to 6,5% of the adult population. A number that is probably
higher if we take into consideration the lack of diagnosis and therapy. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are talking about panic
attacks when the person suffers repeatedly from specific physical and
psychological symptoms. Among the physical symptoms we encounter the
transpiration, the gasp, the rapid pulse, the thoracic pain, the
feeling of being pinched at your body and the change of  temperature
from warmth to cold and vice versa. In the psychological symptoms we
usually find the fear of the person that he/she is losing control,
losing his/her mind or that she/he is dying. The panic attacks differ
from person to person. What they have in common are a feeling of
terror that takes over and paralyzes the person and the expression of
the panic attack in a context or in a situation that does not represent a real threat. 
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The emotional health and
life of a person who suffers from panic attacks is affected
negatively. Furthermore, the comorbidity with depression and addiction from psychoactive drugs is frequent. For somebody who
experiences panic attacks and the fear of a potential attack, the
simple act of going out can demand a careful planning based on
complicated equations in order to avoid stressful  situations. This can
lead to the shrinking of their
social life and the avoidance of all the possible situations of going
out. Because the person is often in a situation of stress and has the
need of support from people around him/her, but does not speak of
his/her disorder, the emotional relationships become harder. In fact
the person does not live his/her life. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In Aerton, we

psychotherapeutic approaches (psychoanalytic, cognitive, behavioral,
systemic, psychodramatic) but our common aim is to offer integrated treatement to people. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Aerton proposes
a short-term innovative intervention for treating panic disorder in groups, using psychodrama. At this intervention, panic disorder is approached as an
addiction; the

The members of the group substitute their addictive function of
panic with the<b> security provided by the group.</b> The results are
spectacular.</p>

These ten sessions are carried out by the therapists once a week. The
group, without the presence of the therapists, meets three times per

the group and to control the results of the program, ten (10) follow up group

We founded ""Aerton - psychological services,"" on January 5, 2015 in order to make treatement and prevention accessible for the largest possible part of the population. We are interested in providing innovative and effective therapies and seminars. 


Our most recent innovative therapeutic project is treating panic disorder as an addictive behavior, quickly and effectively, using the most powerful therapeutic tool of psychodrama. 
Panic disorder is considered an addictive behavior (including withdrawal syndrome and relapses); the counterweight against it is powerful dynamic of the group. The members of the group substitute the addictive nature of
panic with the security provided by the group. Having massively postive results with the last year's groups we have decided to expand this project. 
Our goal is to take it to the next level and be able to adress this effective therapy to people who suffer from panic attacks but cannot afford it. Indeed, panic disorder is a common health problem in the population and is usually undertreated. 
The current economic situation in Greece is making it even harder for people to seek and find adequate treatement. 
That is when we thought of commiting other people to our goal. You. 



 




Let's talk about Panic Attacks



Imagine that you are at
the airport and the check-in of your flight is closing in 15 minutes.
You don't know the airport, your suitcase is enormously heavy, all
the trolleys are taken and the place is overcrowded with thousands of
people. You start running panicky, your pulse increases, you sweat,
your conception of the space is changed and you arrive at the
check-in desk a complete wreck, just in time before it closes. What a
relief you are in! Now, think of this situation but without the final
outcome and the subsequent decrease of your adrenaline, because there would be no concrete stressful situation that demands your alert. If you
succeed in getting into this role you can feel the 1/100 of what a
person who suffers from panic attacks experiences.





Panic attacks occur to
people with different demographics and socials characteristics, so
they represent the torturing reality of many people from different
social backgrounds. It's a common health issue which concerns between
3,5% to 6,5% of the adult population. A number that is probably
higher if we take into consideration the lack of diagnosis and therapy. 



We are talking about panic
attacks when the person suffers repeatedly from specific physical and
psychological symptoms. Among the physical symptoms we encounter the
transpiration, the gasp, the rapid pulse, the thoracic pain, the
feeling of being pinched at your body and the change of  temperature
from warmth to cold and vice versa. In the psychological symptoms we
usually find the fear of the person that he/she is losing control,
losing his/her mind or that she/he is dying. The panic attacks differ
from person to person. What they have in common are a feeling of
terror that takes over and paralyzes the person and the expression of
the panic attack in a context or in a situation that does not represent a real threat. 

The emotional health and
life of a person who suffers from panic attacks is affected
negatively. Furthermore, the comorbidity with depression and addiction from psychoactive drugs is frequent. For somebody who
experiences panic attacks and the fear of a potential attack, the
simple act of going out can demand a careful planning based on
complicated equations in order to avoid stressful  situations. This can
lead to the shrinking of their
social life and the avoidance of all the possible situations of going
out. Because the person is often in a situation of stress and has the
need of support from people around him/her, but does not speak of
his/her disorder, the emotional relationships become harder. In fact
the person does not live his/her life. 



Innovative approach of panic attacks. 


In Aerton, we
are
a group of mental health professionals with different
psychotherapeutic approaches (psychoanalytic, cognitive, behavioral,
systemic, psychodramatic) but our common aim is to offer integrated treatement to people. 
Aerton proposes
a short-term innovative intervention for treating panic disorder in groups, using psychodrama. At this intervention, panic disorder is approached as an
addiction; the
dynamic of the group is the mainspring of the therapy. 
The members of the group substitute their addictive function of
panic with the security provided by the group. The results are
spectacular.
This therapy was created by Stavros Kevopoulos, founder of Aerton. Having more than 20 years of clinical experience in substance detoxification he noticed the resemblance between Panic disorder and addictive behaviors. This is how he captured the revolutionary idea of approaching Panic disorder as an addictive behavior. Having used psychodrama for years as the most effective therapeutic tool in treating addiction, he created and evolved together with Eleni Karamanou, cofounder of Aerton, the short-term detoxification psychodrama groups for Panic Disorder treatement. 
Since Janyary 2015 we have being verifying the effectiveness, in the field, of this therapy. Both groups of the ex-patients proved, in the follow up sessions, to be Panic free since the end of the therapy. 



The therapy : 


The
group is a closed one (meaning that there are no new entries once the group is formed) and it is composed of ten people who suffer
from panic attacks. It is coordinated by two Aerton therapists.
The program comprises ten
(10) therapeutic group sessions.
These ten sessions are carried out by the therapists once a week. The
group, without the presence of the therapists, meets three times per
week with the purpose of creating a stable net of relations and
support among the participants. In order to sustain the dynamic of
the group and to control the results of the program, ten (10) follow up group
sessions are scheduled in the period that follows.


When
somebody wants to participate in the group, one
(1) personal interview with the therapists
is necessary. The therapists assess if the person is ready to
participate and if the group therapy is beneficial for him. 



At Aerton we want to offer the right therapy to people who don't have the
access to it because of their socio-economic situation. We do this,
because we believe that the
people whom you offer today are those who are going to be of help
tomorrow. In any case
mental health concerns the whole society and not just the people who,
at a specific moment, are, or considered to be, patients.





You make it happen


We
need your contribution. Aerton is a profit making company and that means
that our work is the source of income for each one of us. The company
continues to exist and to offer its services because we are
remunerated for our work. 

We
propose that you participate to our funding with the amount you want
so that we raise money and make a group with people who come from the
following sensitive social groups :


unemployed


women


students


retired
	 
	


and
offer them the therapy without any charge. 

Not only you will be participating in the opening of the therapy in everybody but you will be getting involved in Aerton's life. Meaning that you will be gratified for your involvement. In detail :









All
together




When
the amount is raised, we will address people who suffer from panic
attacks and fulfill the criteria mentioned above and who have expressed
their interest in receiving the therapy. If the individual
session also allows it, the person will participate in the free group
therapy. For ethical reasons and in order to facilitate the therapy, the group
will be composed after the receipt of the necessary amount. 



Once
the group has been created and with the consent of the patients you
will be informed if you desire of this difficult but beautiful therapeutic voyage that the group will take. We will, of course, maintain the
anonymity of the participants. 

We will be more than happy to work on this project and be able to offer our treatement to everybody, without the constraint of money.  


For 5.100$                                         10 people will be cured from panic disorder
For 2.600$                                          5 people will be cured from panic disorder
For more than 5.100$                     a second group (+10 people) will be created. 


We hope that this crowdfunding will also give us the push to create new therapies and groups and to expand our work. 





Help
us give them a solution.



Help
these ten people be cured from panic disorder and help them live
free from the prism of fear and panic attacks.

use of phototherapeutics.
I don’t assume any responsibility or
consequence for any side effects 
                          that occur from the use of this device.
                                         Therefore you should
                              WEIGHT THE PROS & THE CONS

This deserves repetition
: It’s the scientists who found the utility of 
 phototherapeutics. We all have to take our hat off to those scientists.
                         Me?
I had the idea for this direction,  
                          and the motivation to make good use.

Life is not what it seems. I have seen the imperfection and unfairness 
in our lives. So, please help me to help you and those people

                who suffer nasal problems out there.

</strong><p></p><p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p><p>On October 25, 2012 one of the worst storms I ever seen hit our town of Newark, NJ called hurricane “Sandy”. Hurricane Sandy did so much damage we are still repairing shore lines and beaches until this day. When hurricane “Sandy” hit it devastated so many homes and families. Much of the state of New Jersey was left without any electricity or drinking water. Our power was out in our home for over two weeks. This was a very scary time for many people, not just because the lack of electricity but the lack of being able to communicate with others. Our cell phones were down and out of battery power. We also could not listen to the local weather or news on the radio because the batteries we had ran out eventually. We swore after hurricane “Sandy” was over we would come up with a solution to combat these issues if that were to ever happen again. This is how we came up with the Solar Bright Light Multifunction Flashlight. This flashlight has a Solar Powered Panel, Rechargeable Lithium Battery, USB Charging Port, Radio and Speaker, Emergency Flash Lighting, Super Bright Led Lights and can be clamped bicycle handlebars also. The reason we are raising money is to fully develop the Solar Bright Light multifunction flashlight system. We want to get the product manufactured and distributed to as many families as possible. </p><p><strong>Our Goal &amp; Purpose</strong></p><p>We will even donate some products to charities such as RED CROSS,SALVATION ARMY,GOODWILL and various other community service organization that help people. We believe after the hurricane “Sandy” experience we have to try to help not just ourselves but others that may go through similar situations. Some of the proceeds that are raised from the sale of the product will also be donated to some charities. The funds will also be used to manufacture and assemble the product in the state of New Jersey in which can and will create some “GREEN” jobs. </p><p>This is one of the main reasons why we developed  Solarville Communications, LLC.

The problem I kept finding with the aftercare products was that all of them contained petroleum byproducts or chemicals. I set out with the help of my tattoo artist to make all natural, chemical, petroleum, paraben, and lanolin free tattoo butter and tattoo balms. My tattoo butter is made without any water added as well so it is an ultra concentrated formula. One pea sized drop will cover an entire arm. It's made with cocoa butter, shea butter, coconut oil, hempseed oil, vitamin e oil, aloe vera, grapeseed oil, avocado oil, golden jojoba oil, argan oil, tea tree oil, and organic beeswax.  Our goal is to bring this great product to a larger audience. We are currently being carried by a few tattoo artists as well as a tattoo supply store. We are advertising in Tattoo Magazine as well as on their website. In order to expand we need some working capital. We are looking to increase the size of our filler unit in order to make larger orders. This will run us around $900. We are also looking to help keep costs down by purchasing ingredients in large batches to help pass the savings along to you, the customer. This is where you come in. With your donations we can continue to grow. But please don't think you're just giving us money. With each donation there is a perk. We don't expect a handout. You will be receiving some of our great products in addition to some VERY rare and special goodies! So please don't hesitate to contribute and please share this with all your fellow tattoo lovers! </p></div>","Hi, I'm Josh. I started getting tattooed over 10 years ago and haven't stopped.

<p>A year ago we conducted first experiments with our new technology and realised that we could create something really unique.The moment when the first DIRO prototype opened his eyes and said ""Hello, world!"" was really amazing. It was a long journey and we spent all our time in developing and testing the world's first teddy bear robot. Today we have the finished pre-production prototype and with your support we will be able to start manufacturing DIRO on a larger scale. With your help DIRO will be able to get to each house, ecpecially to those who needs him most.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <h4><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Supplier delays </b></h4>
<p>Since DIRO consists of many different technological components, we have to deal with numerous suppliers. Although we do have several options for each component, communication with suppliers or shipment delays can cause unexpected delays which the process, especially since many electronic components are being manufactured in Asia. We will obviously keep everyone updated about our progress and we will do whatever we can to avoid delays but unfortunately not everything can be prevented. </p>

<p><b>Voice recognition<br/></b></p>
<p>We use external services for high quality speech recognition and therefore we depend on the policies of these services' providers. The current policies are favorable to us and it is unlikely that they will change in the future. In fact, we expect to see even greater technologies available to use very soon! <br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>CE/FCC Certifications</b></p>
<p>Although we are doing our very best and are in constant communication with test labs, CE and FCC certifications remain a tricky issue. Firstly, they are not cheap and FCC requires extensive testing by accredited labs. And secondly, they might cause a delay with the process if clearance is not given to us within the estimated time frame.</p>

Perks
We are offering our supporters a wide range of perks. No matter what you give, you get a chance to be a part of something truly awesome!
















Story
A year ago we conducted first experiments with our new technology and realised that we could create something really unique.The moment when the first DIRO prototype opened his eyes and said ""Hello, world!"" was really amazing. It was a long journey and we spent all our time in developing and testing the world's first teddy bear robot. Today we have the finished pre-production prototype and with your support we will be able to start manufacturing DIRO on a larger scale. With your help DIRO will be able to get to each house, ecpecially to those who needs him most.




Team
We are a diverse team made up of high-class engineers, inventors, designers and developers. We are unified by one dream: to create an unique home robot with endless possibilties, that will make world better. We are uniquely qualified to make this dream a reality. We hope that you join us in supporting DIRO, so that we can make history together!




    
Our mission

Nowadays the world is divided into two parts: simple things and high-tech. We want to combine both. We believe that technology should serve simple things in our every day life. Playing with a real teddy bear robot instead of looking into smartphones provides a real sense of technology in a simple object, improving the entertainment kids get.




Timeline

It's been a long journey but now we are 70% ready for mass production. All we need is a little push to get us over the edge!


Risks & Challenges Supplier delays 
Since DIRO consists of many different technological components, we have to deal with numerous suppliers. Although we do have several options for each component, communication with suppliers or shipment delays can cause unexpected delays which the process, especially since many electronic components are being manufactured in Asia. We will obviously keep everyone updated about our progress and we will do whatever we can to avoid delays but unfortunately not everything can be prevented. 


Voice recognition
We use external services for high quality speech recognition and therefore we depend on the policies of these services' providers. The current policies are favorable to us and it is unlikely that they will change in the future. In fact, we expect to see even greater technologies available to use very soon! 

CE/FCC Certifications
Although we are doing our very best and are in constant communication with test labs, CE and FCC certifications remain a tricky issue. Firstly, they are not cheap and FCC requires extensive testing by accredited labs. And secondly, they might cause a delay with the process if clearance is not given to us within the estimated time frame.

    


FAQ

DIRO looks too good to be true. Is this for real?

We have an amazing team to bring DIRO to life. While not everything in the video will necessarily be there at launch, the DIRO skills described above are part of the core skill set. 
What languages are supported?

The first version will support English. We will add support for additional languages in future. We will keep the community posted!
What about battery life?
DIRO works approximately 16 hours with a fully charged battery and about 4 days in stand by mode.",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><b>#KilimanjaroChallenge </b></p>
<p><b>¡Bienvenidos
a ""Cumbre Bey"" - Kilimanjaro Challenge!</b></p>
<p>Hola, me presento para los que no me
conocéis. Soy <b>Gema Hassen-Bey</b>, <b>medallista paralímpica de esgrima y
comunicadora social</b>. He participado en <b>cinco
Juegos Paralímpicos consecutivos</b> (Barcelona 92, Atlanta 96, Sydney 2000,
Atenas 2004 y Beijing 2008) y también he trabajado como experta en comunicación
social con proyectos pioneros como el programa social ""El mundo se mueve
contigo” en TVE y el primer “Resumen Especial Paralímpicos Londres 2012” de
nuestro país durante los Juegos de Londres 2012 en Teledeporte. <b>Soy una persona interesada en grandes retos
que ayuden a mejorar mi vida y la de otras personas.</b></p>
<p>Quiero invitaros a participar en mi
nuevo proyecto. Un viaje iniciático <b>reto
deportivo histórico  y a la vez social, “Cumbre Bey – Kilimanjaro Challenge”</b> 
<a href=""http://diverscity.es/el-reto-cumbre-bey/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://diverscity.es/el-reto-cumbre-bey/</span></a> 
.Me propongo lograr el hito histórico de ser la <b>primera mujer en silla de ruedas en conquistar la cima del Kilimanjaro</b>,
casi un seis mil, (5.895m) y culminarlo por mi propio esfuerzo. </p>
<p><b>Aunque el
objetivo es alcanzar la cima, lo más importante para mi es el proceso, el
camino que recorreré hasta alcanzarla y los recursos que pueda legar a otras
personas para contribuir a una mejora de vida. Por eso, todo el aprendizaje,
voy a compartirlo en <a href=""http://www.diverscity.es"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.diverscity.es</span></a> y en las Redes Sociales Twitter, Instagram y
Facebook.</b></p>
<p>Para lograrlo no voy sola, cuento con
una “cordada” excepcional compuesta por un equipo altamente cualificado que me
asegura el éxito del ascenso. </p>
<p>Aunque mi equipo base es de unas 15
personas quiero ir acompañada por todos vosotros y quiero que lleguemos a ser <b>15 millones los que conquistemos la cima</b>.
Subiré gracias a la contribución de todos y cada uno de vosotros. Unidos por
los valores que nos mueven, juntos demostraremos que todos podemos alcanzar
nuestra propia cima. </p>
<p><b>Mi lema de
vida es: “Si te mueves tú, el mundo se mueve contigo”</b></p>
<p><b><u>Lo que necesitamos</u></b></p>
<p><b>#KilimanjaroChallenge
</b></p>
<p>·  Para coronar el “techo de
África” primero tenemos que planificar bien este año de entrenamiento. No puedo
ir directa al Kilimanjaro, antes tengo que <b>lograr
el ascenso de hasta 7 cimas,</b> que poco a poco os iré desvelando. Cada cima
tendrá un <i>crowdfunding</i> para poder
compartirla con todos vosotros y que os sintáis participes de cada una de
ellas. </p>
<p>·  La <b>Primera Cumbre</b> y <b>mi primer
‘Reto de Retos’</b> fué el <b>Monte Abantos
1.753m.</b> Coordenadas 40°37′N, 4°9′W
En decimal40.616667, -4.15° <br/></p><p>Situado en la Sierra de Guadarrama en la Comunidad de Madrid, en el
municipio de San Lorenzo del Escorial. Lo culminé con éxito y los medios de comunicación se hicieron eco de este hito. Podéis verlo en este enlace: <br/></p><p><a href=""http://diverscity.es/destacado/as-tv-abantos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://diverscity.es/destacado/as-tv-abantos/</a><br/></p>
<p>·  La <b>Segunda Cumbre</b> y <b>mi segundo
‘Reto de Retos’</b> es el ascenso de <b>La Bola del Mundo 2.265m.</b>  Conocida también como el Alto de las Guarramillas. Coordenadas <span><a href=""http://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?language=es&amp;pagename=Bola_del_Mundo&amp;params=40.785_N_-3.979_E_type:mountain"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>40°47′06″N 3°58′44″O</span></span></span></a></span> <br/></p>
<p>·  Para subir esta cumbre, <b>lo que necesito</b> es conseguir algunas modificaciones para la <b>Explorer Handbike All Terrain</b> todoterreno fabricada en Polonia, el <b>transporte</b>
para trasladarnos a la montaña, la <b>nutrición</b>
energética necesaria para realizar la ascensión y la <b>equipación</b> deportiva y técnica de montaña para todo el equipo que
realizaremos el ascenso. La <b>logística y comunicación.<br/></b></p><p>·  Aunque vivo rodeada de montañas,
nunca antes había subido con mi silla de ruedas. Con este reto, espero <b>promover la fabricación de una silla</b>
que permita a más personas con movilidad reducida disfrutar de la naturaleza.</p>
<p>·  Veréis que <b>absolutamente  todo lo recaudado se destinará a la asociación Bey proAction que promueve esta acción y a la
consecución de un bien social</b> Os iré contando cómo se prepara y cómo
conseguimos lo que necesitamos para el destino final de vuestra contribución.
Recordar que os lo cuento todo, con total <b>transparencia</b>
en mis redes sociales y en la página del reto <b><a href=""http://www.diverscity.es"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.diverscity.es <br/></span></a></b></p>
<p>·  Si logramos entre todos la
financiación, haré un <b>evento</b> al que
estaréis invitados para celebrar el éxito de esta segunda etapa. Un momento
especial para celebrar con todos los que me habréis ayudado a lograrlo.</p>
<p>·  <b>Muchas gracias</b> por participar directamente en este ‘Reto de Retos’.</p>
<p><b><u>El impacto de ""Cumbre Bey""</u></b></p>
<p><b>#KilimanjaroChallenge
</b></p>
<p>Muchos medios de comunicación ya se
están haciendo eco del reto. Marca, El País, La Razón, La Vanguardia, 20
Minutos, la cadena SER, Cope, RNE, Radio Libertad y Onda Cero, entre otros, nos
apoyan. Podéis ver los <b>artículos y
entrevistas</b> en la zona de prensa de <b><a href=""http://www.diverscity.es"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.diverscity.es</span></a></b>
¡Y es solo el inicio de este maravilloso reto!</p>
<p>·  Va a ser un reto emocional
donde compartiré todo sobre <i>coaching</i>,
preparación física, además de impulsar el desarrollo tecnológico y de  I+D
que favorezca la vida de otras personas. </p>
<p>·  Anteriormente he realizado
otros desafíos y os aseguro que objetivo que me propongo, objetivo que consigo.
</p>
<p><b>Otros retos que he conseguido anteriormente son: </b></p>
<p>o  Ser pionera de la esgrima
paralímpica en España.</p>
<p>o  Ganar la primera medalla en
unos Juegos para España (Barcelona 92). </p>
<p>o  Participar en cinco Juegos Paralímpicos
consecutivos. </p>
<p>o  Ser la primera deportista
paralímpica en colaborar activamente en una Candidatura Olímpica (Madrid 2M12).</p>
<p>o  Crear y presentar uno de los
primeros programas de televisión de contenido social en la 2 de TVE </p>
<p>o  Impulsar, crear y presentar la
primera retransmisión durante los Juegos Paralímpicos de Londres 2012 en
Teledeporte (TVE). </p>
<p>·  Y ahora este ‘Reto de Retos’
que quiero compartir con vosotros. Tenéis todo mi compromiso ya que mi vida, de
ahora en adelante, sólo estará enfocada en el reto.</p><p><b>Retos que ya he conseguido en el #KilimanjaroChallenge</b></p><p>o La Hanbyke Explorer All terrain y que ya existan empresas trabajando en su mejora para permitir el ascenso en montaña para personas con movilidad reducida.</p><p>o Presentación del reto en el Kilómetro 0 de la Puerta del Sol de Madrid<br/></p><p>o Ascender mi primera cima El Monte Abantos 1.753m en San Lorenzo del Escorial acompañada de autoridades de la Comunidad de Madrid.</p><p>o Acudir como emprendedora social seleccionada por la Embajada Américana al GES2015 en Nairobi impulsado por Obama.<br/></p><p>o Recorrer por primera vez una ruta del Camino de Santiago accesible junto a 200 personas con discapacidad y la asociación gallega COGAMI.</p><p>o Realizar varias conferencias de motivación para empleados de compañías internacionales e institutos.<br/></p>
<p><b><u>Riesgos y desafíos</u></b></p>
<p><b>#KilimanjaroChallenge </b></p>
<p>Soy consciente de que el <b>‘Reto de Retos’</b> es toda una aventura en
la que no me juego una medalla como en los Juegos Paralímpicos, sino en cierto
modo la vida. Pero todos los riesgos son asumibles si los planteas con tiempo y
cuidado. Por eso llevo un gran equipo detrás que me acompaña y me ayuda a
superar todos los obstáculos.</p>
<p>·  Tendré que salvar la dificultad
del ascenso con mi silla en tres hábitats diferentes, selva, pendiente
volcánica con rocas, y en la cima nos espera la nieve. </p>
<p>·  Superar aspectos vitales como
la altura a partir de los 3.000m, el frío, el calor, el esfuerzo y la
resistencia física y mental.</p>
<p>·  Para mí cada obstáculo es un
desafío. Las personas y la tecnología me ayudarán y de esta forma promoveré

(Barcelona 92, Atlanta 96, Sydney 2000, Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008) and I
have also worked as an expert in social communication. I collaborated with
innovative projects like the social program “El mundo se mueve contigo” for the
Spanish National TV network, TVE, and in the first recap program about the
Paralympic Games in Spain, “Resumen Especial Paralímpicos Londres 2012”,
broadcast on Teledeporte channel. <b>I

<p>I hope to become a milestone, to become

<p><b><u>The dangers and the challenges</u></b></p>
<p><b>#KilimanjaroChallenge
</b></p>
<p>I am aware that the ‘Challenge of the
Challenges’ is an amazing adventure in where I am not fighting for a medal, I
am risking my life for a dream. But all dangers are acceptable if you work with
time and care. For that reason, the best team ever is going with me and each
one of them is helping me to overcome every obstacle. </p>
<p>·  On Mount Kilimanjaro my
wheelchair and I will have to cross three different habitats: jungle, volcanic
slopes with rocks and snow at the top.</p>
<p>·  At 3,000 meters I must overcome
the altitude, the cold, the heat, the sacrifice and the physical and mental
challenges.</p>
<p>·  Each obstacle will be an
adversary. People and technology will help me and I will promote beneficial
business developments to help others.</p>
<p>·  It is an initiation challenge
because it will be the first time that I will use a wheelchair in these kinds
of areas. A new experience that will move me away from my comfort zone to
connect me with new people and amazing experiences.</p>
<p><b><u>Other ways to collaborate</u></b></p>
<p><b>#KilimanjaroChallenge
</b></p>
<p>The beginning to make this crowdfunding
is because I would involve all of you in the project to be part in the

Cumbre Bey el ‘Reto de Retos’
#KilimanjaroChallenge 
¡Bienvenidos
a ""Cumbre Bey"" - Kilimanjaro Challenge!
Hola, me presento para los que no me
conocéis. Soy Gema Hassen-Bey, medallista paralímpica de esgrima y
comunicadora social. He participado en cinco
Juegos Paralímpicos consecutivos (Barcelona 92, Atlanta 96, Sydney 2000,
Atenas 2004 y Beijing 2008) y también he trabajado como experta en comunicación
social con proyectos pioneros como el programa social ""El mundo se mueve
contigo” en TVE y el primer “Resumen Especial Paralímpicos Londres 2012” de
nuestro país durante los Juegos de Londres 2012 en Teledeporte. Soy una persona interesada en grandes retos
que ayuden a mejorar mi vida y la de otras personas.
Quiero invitaros a participar en mi
nuevo proyecto. Un viaje iniciático reto
deportivo histórico  y a la vez social, “Cumbre Bey – Kilimanjaro Challenge” 
http://diverscity.es/el-reto-cumbre-bey/ 
.Me propongo lograr el hito histórico de ser la primera mujer en silla de ruedas en conquistar la cima del Kilimanjaro,
casi un seis mil, (5.895m) y culminarlo por mi propio esfuerzo. 
Aunque el
objetivo es alcanzar la cima, lo más importante para mi es el proceso, el
camino que recorreré hasta alcanzarla y los recursos que pueda legar a otras
personas para contribuir a una mejora de vida. Por eso, todo el aprendizaje,
voy a compartirlo en www.diverscity.es y en las Redes Sociales Twitter, Instagram y
Facebook.
Para lograrlo no voy sola, cuento con
una “cordada” excepcional compuesta por un equipo altamente cualificado que me
asegura el éxito del ascenso. 
Aunque mi equipo base es de unas 15
personas quiero ir acompañada por todos vosotros y quiero que lleguemos a ser 15 millones los que conquistemos la cima.
Subiré gracias a la contribución de todos y cada uno de vosotros. Unidos por
los valores que nos mueven, juntos demostraremos que todos podemos alcanzar
nuestra propia cima. 
Mi lema de
vida es: “Si te mueves tú, el mundo se mueve contigo”
Lo que necesitamos
#KilimanjaroChallenge

·  Para coronar el “techo de
África” primero tenemos que planificar bien este año de entrenamiento. No puedo
ir directa al Kilimanjaro, antes tengo que lograr
el ascenso de hasta 7 cimas, que poco a poco os iré desvelando. Cada cima
tendrá un crowdfunding para poder
compartirla con todos vosotros y que os sintáis participes de cada una de
ellas. 
·  La Primera Cumbre y mi primer
‘Reto de Retos’ fué el Monte Abantos
1.753m. Coordenadas 40°37′N, 4°9′W
En decimal40.616667, -4.15° Situado en la Sierra de Guadarrama en la Comunidad de Madrid, en el
municipio de San Lorenzo del Escorial. Lo culminé con éxito y los medios de comunicación se hicieron eco de este hito. Podéis verlo en este enlace: http://diverscity.es/destacado/as-tv-abantos/
·  La Segunda Cumbre y mi segundo
‘Reto de Retos’ es el ascenso de La Bola del Mundo 2.265m.  Conocida también como el Alto de las Guarramillas. Coordenadas 40°47′06″N 3°58′44″O 
·  Para subir esta cumbre, lo que necesito es conseguir algunas modificaciones para la Explorer Handbike All Terrain todoterreno fabricada en Polonia, el transporte
para trasladarnos a la montaña, la nutrición
energética necesaria para realizar la ascensión y la equipación deportiva y técnica de montaña para todo el equipo que
realizaremos el ascenso. La logística y comunicación.·  Aunque vivo rodeada de montañas,
nunca antes había subido con mi silla de ruedas. Con este reto, espero promover la fabricación de una silla
que permita a más personas con movilidad reducida disfrutar de la naturaleza.
·  Veréis que absolutamente  todo lo recaudado se destinará a la asociación Bey proAction que promueve esta acción y a la
consecución de un bien social Os iré contando cómo se prepara y cómo
conseguimos lo que necesitamos para el destino final de vuestra contribución.
Recordar que os lo cuento todo, con total transparencia
en mis redes sociales y en la página del reto www.diverscity.es 
·  Si logramos entre todos la
financiación, haré un evento al que
estaréis invitados para celebrar el éxito de esta segunda etapa. Un momento
especial para celebrar con todos los que me habréis ayudado a lograrlo.
·  Muchas gracias por participar directamente en este ‘Reto de Retos’.
El impacto de ""Cumbre Bey""
#KilimanjaroChallenge

Muchos medios de comunicación ya se
están haciendo eco del reto. Marca, El País, La Razón, La Vanguardia, 20
Minutos, la cadena SER, Cope, RNE, Radio Libertad y Onda Cero, entre otros, nos
apoyan. Podéis ver los artículos y
entrevistas en la zona de prensa de www.diverscity.es
¡Y es solo el inicio de este maravilloso reto!
·  Va a ser un reto emocional
donde compartiré todo sobre coaching,
preparación física, además de impulsar el desarrollo tecnológico y de  I+D
que favorezca la vida de otras personas. 
·  Anteriormente he realizado
otros desafíos y os aseguro que objetivo que me propongo, objetivo que consigo.

Otros retos que he conseguido anteriormente son: 
o  Ser pionera de la esgrima
paralímpica en España.
o  Ganar la primera medalla en
unos Juegos para España (Barcelona 92). 
o  Participar en cinco Juegos Paralímpicos
consecutivos. 
o  Ser la primera deportista
paralímpica en colaborar activamente en una Candidatura Olímpica (Madrid 2M12).
o  Crear y presentar uno de los
primeros programas de televisión de contenido social en la 2 de TVE 
o  Impulsar, crear y presentar la
primera retransmisión durante los Juegos Paralímpicos de Londres 2012 en
Teledeporte (TVE). 
·  Y ahora este ‘Reto de Retos’
que quiero compartir con vosotros. Tenéis todo mi compromiso ya que mi vida, de
ahora en adelante, sólo estará enfocada en el reto.Retos que ya he conseguido en el #KilimanjaroChallengeo La Hanbyke Explorer All terrain y que ya existan empresas trabajando en su mejora para permitir el ascenso en montaña para personas con movilidad reducida.o Presentación del reto en el Kilómetro 0 de la Puerta del Sol de Madrido Ascender mi primera cima El Monte Abantos 1.753m en San Lorenzo del Escorial acompañada de autoridades de la Comunidad de Madrid.o Acudir como emprendedora social seleccionada por la Embajada Américana al GES2015 en Nairobi impulsado por Obama.o Recorrer por primera vez una ruta del Camino de Santiago accesible junto a 200 personas con discapacidad y la asociación gallega COGAMI.o Realizar varias conferencias de motivación para empleados de compañías internacionales e institutos.
Riesgos y desafíos
#KilimanjaroChallenge 
Soy consciente de que el ‘Reto de Retos’ es toda una aventura en
la que no me juego una medalla como en los Juegos Paralímpicos, sino en cierto
modo la vida. Pero todos los riesgos son asumibles si los planteas con tiempo y
cuidado. Por eso llevo un gran equipo detrás que me acompaña y me ayuda a
superar todos los obstáculos.
·  Tendré que salvar la dificultad
del ascenso con mi silla en tres hábitats diferentes, selva, pendiente
volcánica con rocas, y en la cima nos espera la nieve. 
·  Superar aspectos vitales como
la altura a partir de los 3.000m, el frío, el calor, el esfuerzo y la
resistencia física y mental.
·  Para mí cada obstáculo es un
desafío. Las personas y la tecnología me ayudarán y de esta forma promoveré
desarrollos beneficiosos para otras personas.
·  Además, es un reto iniciático
porque será la primera vez que utilizo una silla de ruedas en un terreno tan
desconocido. Una experiencia totalmente nueva para mí que me va a alejar de mi
área de confort para conectarme con personas y experiencias nuevas.
Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar

The dangers and the challenges
#KilimanjaroChallenge

I am aware that the ‘Challenge of the
Challenges’ is an amazing adventure in where I am not fighting for a medal, I
am risking my life for a dream. But all dangers are acceptable if you work with
time and care. For that reason, the best team ever is going with me and each
one of them is helping me to overcome every obstacle. 
·  On Mount Kilimanjaro my
wheelchair and I will have to cross three different habitats: jungle, volcanic
slopes with rocks and snow at the top.
·  At 3,000 meters I must overcome
the altitude, the cold, the heat, the sacrifice and the physical and mental
challenges.
·  Each obstacle will be an
adversary. People and technology will help me and I will promote beneficial
business developments to help others.
·  It is an initiation challenge
because it will be the first time that I will use a wheelchair in these kinds
of areas. A new experience that will move me away from my comfort zone to
connect me with new people and amazing experiences.

<div></div>
<p>There are roughly 673 Million people in Mexico, Central and
South America, most of them without access to adequate healthcare. It is our
mission to bring natural healthcare to this part of the world, to those who
need it most!  We have successfully
trained Natural Health Sciences Practitioners who currently are operating an
NHS Clinic in Mexico.  The need is so
great that some patients drive over six hours to be treated at this facility. The
conditions helped by these practitioners include: disc injuries, digestive problems, asthma, colic, skin
conditions, arthritis, neuropathy, neck and back problems, migraines, headaches, vertigo, nutritional deficiencies and a host
of other debilitating health problems.</p>
<p>After opening this clinic and seeing both the dramatic impact on
the health of the patients and the overwhelming demand for the care, it has
become evident there is a need to train and support additional practitioners throughout Mexico, Central America and South America who can return to
their communities and establish additional Natural Health Science Clinics.  As a result, the Natural Health
Science Institute (Instituto de Ciencias Naturales de la Salud) was established
in 2014.  Through the efforts and
personal financial contributions of the founders as well as through the support
of the local community, a school location and class room facilities have been
established.  On August 17<sup>th</sup>
2015 the first class of the Natural Health Sciences Institute began their
studies!</p>

</p>
<p>This is just

to change healthcare for the world by providing proven, effective, and natural
healing. Thomas Edison explains NHS's future best: </p>
<p></p>
<h1>“The doctor of the future will give no medication, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, diet and in the cause and prevention of disease. ~ ”</h1>
<div>
<p>Our clinic in Mexico has the practitioners of the future that
Edison was talking about. These clinicians have been operating for nearly 10
years and literally have touched thousands of lives, restoring health and
maintaining the health of people who otherwise would never have had access to
natural and effective care. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div></div>
<p>Many challenges have already been conquered. Here is a list of
what we have done so far:</p>
<p>-A comprehensive curriculum including basic health sciences as
well as clinical sciences has been established.</p>
<p>-A clinical setting has been found to provide practical clinical
training for the students.</p>
<p>-A school building and classroom facilities have been located
and access procured to allow us a clean and effective environment to teach.</p>
<p>-Computer access with updated internet have been installed in
the classroom to aid with internet based learning.</p>
<p>-Qualified faculty willing to work for now at no compensation to
support this vision have been identified and are now instructing in the
Institute.</p>
<p>-Students who have the innate desire to bring healing into their
communities have come forward and more are coming to us interested in beginning
this journey</p>
<p><b>The ball is rolling, the question is how fast can you help us
push it?</b> The people of Mexico, Central America and South America are in need
right now.  Our current students are from
Mexico, however, we have individuals from as far away as Guyana, South America
who have heard of our program and would like to enroll.<b>  </b>Finances are a concern for them.  You can help their dream become a reality.</p>
<p>Our future challenges are:</p>
<p>-Accommodating an increasing number of students with the
facilities we have</p>
<p>-Establishing appropriate compensation for our instructors</p>
<p>-Establishing a financial foundation for the Natural Sciences
Institute that is stable and enduring so future generations of practitioners
will have the same opportunity our students have today</p>
<p>-Spreading the message of Natural Health Sciences throughout
Mexico, Central America and South America.</p>
<p>-Establishing high quality NHS Clinics operated by our graduates
throughout this part of the world</p>

Third Party fees (PayPal, CC, etc): $1500-$2500
Here's what happens if we exceed or do not meet our goal:



If we do not meet our goal: 
We will use the money we have acquired to provide sponsorships for as
many students as we can help, based on the dollars collected. 


If we EXCEED our goal: 
We will use the funding to improve our facilities. We have a need for
more classroom and clinical equipment as well as teaching supplies. We also owe
money to suppliers for computer equipment installed in the classroom and for
upgraded internet service installed at the school to aid with internet based
learning.


Here is what YOU get:


Any donation is appreciated. 
An individual donation of $4000 will allow sponsorship of one student
through the entire NHS certification program. You will be provided the name and
picture of your student and you will be kept updated on their progress as they
complete the certification process.  No
matter the size of your donation, you will know that your money is being used
to lift students in an underprivileged part of the world out of a bleak future
into a position of hope for their future and a position to improve the health
care in this underserved part of the world.

    The Impact 

This is just
the beginning. This is the first school, the first students. The NHS vision is
to change healthcare for the world by providing proven, effective, and natural
healing. Thomas Edison explains NHS's future best: 

“The doctor of the future will give no medication, but will interest his patients in the care of the human frame, diet and in the cause and prevention of disease. ~ ”

Our clinic in Mexico has the practitioners of the future that
Edison was talking about. These clinicians have been operating for nearly 10
years and literally have touched thousands of lives, restoring health and
maintaining the health of people who otherwise would never have had access to
natural and effective care. 






These are some of the students that your donation will be helping. Each of the students will touch tens of thousands of lives throughout their career. 



Risks & Challenges

Many challenges have already been conquered. Here is a list of
what we have done so far:
-A comprehensive curriculum including basic health sciences as
well as clinical sciences has been established.
-A clinical setting has been found to provide practical clinical
training for the students.
-A school building and classroom facilities have been located
and access procured to allow us a clean and effective environment to teach.
-Computer access with updated internet have been installed in
the classroom to aid with internet based learning.
-Qualified faculty willing to work for now at no compensation to
support this vision have been identified and are now instructing in the
Institute.
-Students who have the innate desire to bring healing into their
communities have come forward and more are coming to us interested in beginning
this journey
The ball is rolling, the question is how fast can you help us
push it? The people of Mexico, Central America and South America are in need
right now.  Our current students are from
Mexico, however, we have individuals from as far away as Guyana, South America
who have heard of our program and would like to enroll.  Finances are a concern for them.  You can help their dream become a reality.
Our future challenges are:
-Accommodating an increasing number of students with the
facilities we have
-Establishing appropriate compensation for our instructors
-Establishing a financial foundation for the Natural Sciences
Institute that is stable and enduring so future generations of practitioners
will have the same opportunity our students have today
-Spreading the message of Natural Health Sciences throughout
Mexico, Central America and South America.
-Establishing high quality NHS Clinics operated by our graduates
throughout this part of the world

<li>dave@biotechsyn.com    we are easy to talk with or answer questions</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
<div>Why does one need this Synergy?<br/><h4>This is Quantum Energy or Universal application used simply to repair ANY area of a human, especially Mind Spirit and Body and we have a Global network to support any new user-we don't just ship you a Transmitter-it is the Science that flows through it that you need and we provide all codes and frequencies with the order, or contact us anytime by email or phone 12/7. Simple to use as a Toothbrush.</h4>
</div>
<h4>Is this safe and easy to use?</h4>
<p>Yes, proven since 1934 and used Globally by over 300000 people and growing fast as we adapt now to the Technology and opening of minds. Yes simple to use, simply select and enter the codes to affect your energy and life. You can use it for an hour or sleep with the pads attached to your feet or ankles with light socks to hold them in place, this will give a great 8 hour session of rejuvenation. 8 to 16 hours a week will be fine for most people to live at 100%.</p>
<p>Can I feel the energy?<br/>Yes, you can either feel a light beat similar to a heartbeat or a steady flow of energy waves, similar to a very small electrical current in milliamps with HUGE quantum results rapidly, expect results as it has done for 77 years.<br/></p>
<p>How long does it take to have effect?<br/>It depends what you are using it for, for pain or headaches to back problems, the effect is quick, we have seen results in minutes, but don't be impatient just apply the energy and wait for results. Quantum energy can't be pushed or rushed.<br/></p>
<p>What similar machines are used and how do they differ?<br/>Tens machines have been widely used in hospitals and clinics for the past 15 years<br/>but the power and application is Universal for Synergy, Tens machines are good for pain or muscle or therapy -use Synergy for Energy Universal and Pets.</p>
<p>So these use Energy Waves and I program in the frequencies?<br/>Yes, we supply all codes and frequencies with the equipment, customers can call in for questions 12/7 12 hours a day 7 days a week 8am to 8pm London UK time. You use the codes and applications that fit you.<br/>At first it will feel strange but as you start to Energize and get results and see where this can take you, its an easy Quantum step to a new lifestyle.</p>
<p>What is the difference between the Portable and Desktop units.<br/>The portable is simple to use and carry anywhere like a smartphone, the desktop connects to the internet for use age and has wider range for more serious type applications. The portable is best low cost choice at $199 and ready to go.</p>
<p>When will Wifi units be arriving?<br/>We anticipate late May this year at this point. Funding controls delivery.<br/></p>

Just released and on Indiegogo for $99 introduction offer- normal price for this kind of software is $299 to $799. 
The best part is using just a few nights a week can boost the human system as these waves affect every area of the Mind Body and Spirit, we are after all just Spiritual Be-ings in a physical world where there is daily conflict and stress...Even Google is moving in this direction of natural Evolution with a watch 5 years awayGoogle has filed a patent application with the World Intellectual 
Property Organization (WIPO) for a wrist-worn device that could destroy 
cancer cells in the blood. 

 This energy brings about a physical or chemical change in the targets, 
with the aim of reducing or eliminating adverse health effects. 

         
Quantum Synergy works on ANY area related to Health Mind Body and Spirit so can be used by any persons dealing with illness, patients, Nurses or Doctors and Homeopaths - thousands are Globally.



This is Universal Energy using Vibration, codes and frequencies simply to Charge Spirit Mind and Body. As Tesla and Einstein simply say-""use frequencies and Vibration to get Energy."" we provide access by specific Scientific website to Free Energy and we give you the list of codes and frequencies needed.









We've added a Microprocessor and Memory and latest ""Life Chip""  Technology to bring you a first class compact easy to use transmitter, simply attach it with 2 pads and turn on and set it to your level and comfort of use. (these will arrive mid year)



We can use Sound, Energy waves or Light to transmit this human energy but find energy Waves via pads on the Portable as below is the simple way and most effective, so we can just sleep with the boosting for 8 hours using the pads either on feet hands or in the area of the body to be re-vitalized. 
    PLUS            
  Equals 
Energy-Balance-Inner Harmony-Peace-Love.

This Science can be used by anyone but especially those who need a Natural boost with No side effects. Don't wait until you collapse, use Synergy to stay at 100% levels.       

   If we compare this with well 
known Tens machines that are used in Hospitals and Clinics globally for 
the past 15 years we see that Synergy is a comparable field but more 
advanced and far more versatile/Universal in use.

Just out of interest a Dog has an average Vibration of 500 yet a man is still between 200 and 300 levels so Mankind has a ways to go -this is what our Science brings, Energy using frequency codes to Raise our Wellness and Vibration and used simply.Everything in life revolves on this, our Vibration Aura and Spiritual connection...


A dog is at Pure Love, it does not know greed or anger, ego, money or conflict.

This form of Energy has been used over 50 years by the Russians, when they have an Athlete hurt on the track, this equipment stops the bleeding and allows the athlete to keep going using pain relief settings.
Meditation is the key to your Spiritual reality and open your 7 chraka's -use either our Soundtracks or direct energy to express tap into 100% wellness. It took me 46 years to learn meditation the hard way, there is always an easy intelligent way if we are ready to Evolve.

<p>
</p>
<p>Tackling the problem of sexual abuse
seems like a daunting task, because there are several factors
involved.  Think about family therapy: a group of people come in and
point their fingers at the one person who seems to be causing all the
trouble.  That person is called the “identified patient.""  A
skilled practitioner, however, knows that it's not that simple; the
“troublemaker” is part of a whole family system, whose members
are also colluding—even without knowing it—to sustain his problem
behavior.  That's how it is with sexual abuse.  In any sex abuse
scenario you have:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The perpetrator</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>
</p>

<p>the legal system has a procedure

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What's the difference between<br/>PUMP and OMG?</span></h2>
<p>The two brands are aimed at different market segments, but the earphones themselves are <i>close to identical.</i></p>
<p>The physical design, construction, materials used and build quality are exactly the same.</p>
<p>PUMP has a slightly newer driver design which means that it can operate just outside the frequencies that a normal human ear can hear.</p>
<p>Some people say that they can hear this difference, but most (including me!) can not.</p>
<p>Both sound <i>incredible.</i>The only other difference is the box, which is a bit more high end with PUMP and costs us more to make.</p>
<p>To summarise, if I were you, I would go for the colour(s) that you like best!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The headphones themselves:</span></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Here are the specs.</p>
<p>Frequency Range:</p>
<p> - PUMP: <b>16 hz – 24000 hz</b></p>
<p> - OMG: <b>20 hz - 20000 hz</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b></b></span></p>
<p>Sensitivity:</p>
<p> - PUMP: <b>102 dB (+/- 3dB)</b></p>
<p> - OMG: <b>93 dB (+/- 3dB)</b></p>
<p>Impedance: <b>18 ohms</b></p>
<p>Complete <b>Passive Noise Isolation</b></p>
<p>Specially tuned earbuds for <b>small or regular/large ear canals</b></p>
<p>Specially <b>Custom Tuned Drivers</b></p>

<p>The specs in and of themselves can't really articulate the <i>quality of the sound</i> and in particular the bass.</p>
<p>To do that, the only way I can really think of is for you to hear them for yourself. </p>
<p>You can watch the response in the videos, but for all you know those people might be paid actors, or we might have just posted the minority of people who thought PUMP and OMG were better, giving a skewed impression.</p>
<p>In fact, the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY preferred PUMP and OMG to the other brands tested (Beats, SMS Audio, Sennheiser, BOSE, Marley), but of course I can't PROVE that here. It does require you to believe me unfortunately!</p>
<p>The only way to really prove what I am saying is for you to HEAR them for yourself.</p>
<p>That's why we've decided to offer Indiegogo Backers the following guarantee:</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">GUARANTEE</span></h2>
<p>I know that this is a bit unusual for an Indiegogo project, but I would like to propose the following:</p>
<p>If you back us, and at any time within 6 months of the date you receive your headphones they don't live up to your expectations, we will refund your backing amount <b>in full</b>.</p>
<p>All you have to do is email or call us and we will honour this guarantee.</p>
<p>I know that a lot of headphones make bold claims vaguely <i>alluding </i>to the fact that they have amazing sound quality, but then when you listen to them it's hard to distinguish much of a difference. With PUMP and OMG I am <b>categorically stating that you will immediately be able to hear that they sound significantly better than what you are currently using</b>.</p>
<p>A bold claim, and that is why we are offering such a guarantee!</p>
<p>I'm expecting a very small take up on the guarantee, but it's there to give you confidence that what I am saying about the PUMP and OMG sound quality is true.</p>
<p>You can also read the customer reviews we've received so far for <a href=""http://pump-audio.com/what-people-are-saying/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PUMP here</a> and <a href=""http://omgaudio.net/what-peeps-are-saying/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OMG here</a> (they are all 100% genuine) and the <a href=""http://pump-audio.com/artist-endorsements/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Artist Endorsements for PUMP so far here</a> <i>(we haven't yet started approaching artists to review OMG, but will soon!).</i></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Where We're At In<br/>The Creation Process</span></h2>
<p>We're already in production and <b>have the finished articles ready to ship</b> in the quantities shown in each reward level. We have physical possession of the first production at our HQ.</p>
<p>We've sold around 1000 units already and have received reviews from both users and -- in the case of PUMP -- artists and industry experts.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Indiegogo Backer Discount!</h2>
<p>PUMP is usually sold at £99 plus shipping (or your local currencies equivalent).</p>
<p>OMG is usually sold at £79 plus shipping (or your local currencies equivalent).</p>
<p>That means that Indiegogo Backers are getting a 66.35% discount on PUMP and a 62.63% discount on OMG (or more if you order more than one of either).</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">And now for the Perks...</h2>

<p>From feedback from initial users, we found that many wanted carry case or pouch to carry their PUMPs/OMGs in. We've been working on it, with a view to including it in our next generation box design.</p>
<p>However, I've decided to bring it forward and offer a free PUMP carry case to all Backers (whether you've ordered PUMP or OMG).</p>

</div><h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Risks and Challenges</span></h2><div>
<p>As with all Indiegogo projects there are risks, and these are the steps we take to mitigate against them:</p>
<p>1-</p>
<p><b>Loss of or damage to the shipment en route to us:</b></p>
<p>We usually use DHL for inbound shipments from the factory to us. This means that all shipments are fully insured. If we did lose a shipment for reasons I don't want to even mention for fear of tempting fate, it would be insured. We would have to re-manufacture (adding around a month to delivery time) but it would not affect your order.</p>
<p>2-</p>
<p><b>Loss or damage of your headphones en route from our warehouse to you:</b></p>
<p>We will replace any lost shipments. We will either take insurance, or insure ourselves for this eventuality. In the case of the latter (self insurance) then we will ship orders on separate days to mitigate against any unlikely issues such as a delivery truck crashing etc.</p>
<p>3-</p>
<p><b>We go out of business or don't deliver on our promises:</b></p>
<p>The company that owns PUMP and OMG is Speedcam Systems Ltd, which is a registered company in the United Kingdom. Company reg number 07751910. It was incorporated in August 2011 and is 100% owned by me (Adam Blair). It has been profitable every year since 2011. Speedcam Systems Ltd has no bad debt whatsoever. Neither Speedcam Systems or myself are planning to go anywhere any time soon!</p>
<p>4-</p>
<p><b>Our factory goes out of business:</b></p>
<p>I think this is extremely unlikely but if it did occur then we would either find a new factory or refund all orders.</p>

</div></div>","""Better Than Beats?We believe that we have created the World’s greatest sounding in-ear headphones.A bold claim, I agree, but let me try to convince you that it's not the fantasy of a madman...From: Adam BlairFounder, PUMP & OMG AudioDear Indiegogo-ers :-),For the last year I've become somewhat obsessed with creating the perfect in-ear headphones.When I say ""perfect"" I mean in terms of sound quality rather than in terms of adding some kind of revolutionary technology, a gimmicky dual-purpose application, or anything like that.I just wanted the perfect sound and I used Beats as the benchmark.I know that some people don't really like the Beats sound that much due to the ""muddy"" bass (search YouTube if you don't believe me!), but most LOVE it, (including me!), so we aimed at the seemingly impossible task of producing an earphone that appeals to BOTH of these sets of connoisseurs:People that love the bass heavy Beats, and people that prefer a more ""true frequency response""......Essentially, MUSIC LOVERS!WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEATS?Good question.Really, not a lot. We just think we've taken the listening experience and build quality one step further.At first I have to admit that my expectations in producing something that sounded better weren't that high. I have to be honest and tell you that headphones were only one of SEVERAL projects I planned to undertake in 2014.At the start of 2014 I printed out some goals for the year ahead – which included business goals as well as personal goals — such as “be happy and relaxed most of the time” : -)In the business goals section it said “Bring at least 5 new products to market”.And we DID.And then … I launched PUMP Audio.My plan was to continue with more products and brands. I had investigated a quadrocopter product, a tablet computer, TVs… the list went on.But I sort of fell in love with PUMP, and the results were twofold:1- I decided to make sure that my other businesses could run properly with me giving less time to them (turns out they seem to run better, I think because I’ve empowered the people running them to do what *they think is right*, rather than having to ask me all the time);2- I realised how *lucky* I was to be able to attempt a task such as taking on the big audio brands, and that business was not just about how much money you make!I’d instinctively realised the second point when I first started out back in 2004, but somehow had forgotten it in recent years.Money is important, yes, because it allows you to do things (such as start PUMP Audio), and it also allows you to improve people’s lives, including your customers (by offering better products and services), your families, and your own.But money is really not the end goal in itself in my opinion. It’s more about having purpose, passion and doing things that you can be proud of.Anyway, that was the big lesson I learned this year…I've been very honest with you here about how I came to create the PUMP and OMG earphones.It's not exactly a fairy story...I first did it as just one of many products that I planned to bring to market.But as I said, I sort of fell in love with them - I think because of the quality of the product. I know that sounds a bit over the top, but I really mean it.I hope that by reading up on my blog posts you'll see the passion I've got for these earphones.I never really thought we could create something that was MARKET LEADING (in terms of sound quality) when we started, but somehow we did.And from that moment on, I decided to ditch every other new project I was doing and focus all my attention (and available funds) on PUMP and OMG.I could have told you about how it's always been my dream to do it etc., but that would be stretching the truth somewhat!I did try to start a record label in 2007 but that's another story...If you'd told me 18 months ago that I would create and become obsessed with our own audio brand that aimed to BEAT the likes of Beats, BOSE and Sennheiser, I would have probably said ""don't be ridiculous, how could we possibly do that?""!Isn't it amazing how much things can change in a year?Anyhow, I've given you a little background on how PUMP and OMG came in to existence. Now here is what you are probably more interested in...Peoples reactions at the ChristmasIdeal Home Exhibition London(November 2014)...


What's the difference betweenPUMP and OMG?
The two brands are aimed at different market segments, but the earphones themselves are close to identical.
The physical design, construction, materials used and build quality are exactly the same.
PUMP has a slightly newer driver design which means that it can operate just outside the frequencies that a normal human ear can hear.
Some people say that they can hear this difference, but most (including me!) can not.
Both sound incredible.The only other difference is the box, which is a bit more high end with PUMP and costs us more to make.
To summarise, if I were you, I would go for the colour(s) that you like best!
The headphones themselves:

Here are the specs.
Frequency Range:
 - PUMP: 16 hz – 24000 hz
 - OMG: 20 hz - 20000 hz

Sensitivity:
 - PUMP: 102 dB (+/- 3dB)
 - OMG: 93 dB (+/- 3dB)
Impedance: 18 ohms
Complete Passive Noise Isolation
Specially tuned earbuds for small or regular/large ear canals
Specially Custom Tuned Drivers
Weight: <15g
3.5mm Gold Connector Jack
In Line Microphone
Water Resistant
Aluminium Casing (not plastic like Beats etc)
5 Year PUMP Full Replacement Warranty


The specs in and of themselves can't really articulate the quality of the sound and in particular the bass.
To do that, the only way I can really think of is for you to hear them for yourself. 
You can watch the response in the videos, but for all you know those people might be paid actors, or we might have just posted the minority of people who thought PUMP and OMG were better, giving a skewed impression.
In fact, the OVERWHELMING MAJORITY preferred PUMP and OMG to the other brands tested (Beats, SMS Audio, Sennheiser, BOSE, Marley), but of course I can't PROVE that here. It does require you to believe me unfortunately!
The only way to really prove what I am saying is for you to HEAR them for yourself.
That's why we've decided to offer Indiegogo Backers the following guarantee:
GUARANTEE
I know that this is a bit unusual for an Indiegogo project, but I would like to propose the following:
If you back us, and at any time within 6 months of the date you receive your headphones they don't live up to your expectations, we will refund your backing amount in full.
All you have to do is email or call us and we will honour this guarantee.
I know that a lot of headphones make bold claims vaguely alluding to the fact that they have amazing sound quality, but then when you listen to them it's hard to distinguish much of a difference. With PUMP and OMG I am categorically stating that you will immediately be able to hear that they sound significantly better than what you are currently using.
A bold claim, and that is why we are offering such a guarantee!
I'm expecting a very small take up on the guarantee, but it's there to give you confidence that what I am saying about the PUMP and OMG sound quality is true.
You can also read the customer reviews we've received so far for PUMP here and OMG here (they are all 100% genuine) and the Artist Endorsements for PUMP so far here (we haven't yet started approaching artists to review OMG, but will soon!).
Where We're At InThe Creation Process
We're already in production and have the finished articles ready to ship in the quantities shown in each reward level. We have physical possession of the first production at our HQ.
We've sold around 1000 units already and have received reviews from both users and -- in the case of PUMP -- artists and industry experts.
Indiegogo Backer Discount!
PUMP is usually sold at £99 plus shipping (or your local currencies equivalent).
OMG is usually sold at £79 plus shipping (or your local currencies equivalent).
That means that Indiegogo Backers are getting a 66.35% discount on PUMP and a 62.63% discount on OMG (or more if you order more than one of either).
And now for the Perks...




Stretch Goal #1 - PUMP Carry Case(If we reach £10,000)!
From feedback from initial users, we found that many wanted carry case or pouch to carry their PUMPs/OMGs in. We've been working on it, with a view to including it in our next generation box design.
However, I've decided to bring it forward and offer a free PUMP carry case to all Backers (whether you've ordered PUMP or OMG).


Hopefully we'll make this stretch goal and then I'll have to think of some more to add!As you've probably worked out, we are trying to really get the PUMP and OMG brands out there so that they start to go 'viral' and I really feel that Indiegogo is the natural way to achieve that.I'll be *eternally grateful* to you if you would be prepared to help us achieve this internationally (while receiving a pretty awesome set of headphones in return!).Thanks so much for your support, and I can't wait to hear your response to the PUMP & OMG headphones. They will change your enjoyment of the music you love forever. That is my promise.
Yours truly,

Adam BlairFounder, PUMP and OMG Audio

Risks and Challenges
As with all Indiegogo projects there are risks, and these are the steps we take to mitigate against them:
1-
Loss of or damage to the shipment en route to us:
We usually use DHL for inbound shipments from the factory to us. This means that all shipments are fully insured. If we did lose a shipment for reasons I don't want to even mention for fear of tempting fate, it would be insured. We would have to re-manufacture (adding around a month to delivery time) but it would not affect your order.
2-
Loss or damage of your headphones en route from our warehouse to you:
We will replace any lost shipments. We will either take insurance, or insure ourselves for this eventuality. In the case of the latter (self insurance) then we will ship orders on separate days to mitigate against any unlikely issues such as a delivery truck crashing etc.
3-
We go out of business or don't deliver on our promises:
The company that owns PUMP and OMG is Speedcam Systems Ltd, which is a registered company in the United Kingdom. Company reg number 07751910. It was incorporated in August 2011 and is 100% owned by me (Adam Blair). It has been profitable every year since 2011. Speedcam Systems Ltd has no bad debt whatsoever. Neither Speedcam Systems or myself are planning to go anywhere any time soon!
4-
Our factory goes out of business:
I think this is extremely unlikely but if it did occur then we would either find a new factory or refund all orders.
5-
I can't think of any other risks but if you have questions please don't hesitate to ask. If the reply is slow then the reason is that I will be answering all emails myself so if we are deluged with questions it might take a while to get through them all! I'll post the most common questions up on Indiegogo as we go along.",15.0,1,"5 Campaigns

It will help with hundred, if not thousand of people to be able to be a part of, to keep them active and healthy through sports participation. Looking towards the future it gives Mexico RL a chance to become something that will represent it's people and country on the world stage. 
Establishing this league and National team will also help create jobs and new businesses as well. Which will have a huge boost to the communities and wider areas where Rugby League will be involved, with potential growth to all area of mexico.
   Risks & Challenges I have been a part of establishing community clubs in the UK as well as coaching at professional clubs. I am fully aware that the creation of a new sport in an area can be extremely challenging, furthermore I realized that without a decent funding pot to begin, things are even more so.

<h2>Sleep Well in Stressful Times</h2>
<p>By listening to a certain tune that directly influences the neural system anyone can effectively lower one's levels of cortisol (the stress hormone that causes long-term health damage), and experience better sleep and higher tolerance for potentially stressful situations. We want to make this available to everyone.</p>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>This was originally designed for my wife, because when too many things happened in too short a time, she had a hard time trying to unwind and find rest at night. In search for a solution I got to know <a href=""http://www.awakenedliving.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://administrivia.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris C. Stewart</a>. We developed an online working relationship (he is in Australia and I am in Austria ;-) and together we created a nice little audio tool.</p>
<p>Our working title was ""Quick Fix"", but later we called it <b>Deep Harmony :: peace</b>. My wife was happy! It works like a charm. Listening to it remarkably reduced cortisol levels in her, and does so in most people. So we decided to offer it to the wider community. First we burnt each CD on my home PC, then demand grew and we had them pressed. To date we have sold just over 3000 CDs.</p>
<img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433400116/dqalswtpoasm801bx36s.jpg"" hspace=""20px"" src="""" style=""text-align: left;""/>
<p>This was physical CDs, taken to the post office, delivered to Austria, Germany and Switzerland. But we know there are way too many stressed sensitives all over the planet! Over-stimulated people, in daily need of a non-drug aid that helps them to unwind and recuperate. And many of them don't even <i>own</i> CD-players any more. We want to meet their needs too.</p>
<p>In order to do this we are now <b>going international</b>. And that's where you come in!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need money for a web-shop with online payment and download logistics</li>
<li>We need publicity: people who need it need to know about it!</li>
</ul>
<p>This campaign is supposed to serve both ends, with the publicity being by far the more important one. If we don't quite meet our financial goals it will still happen, it will just take much longer. But it is essential that people know about this.</p>
<p><b>Please support us!</b> Maybe you have sleeping problems yourself in challenging times. Put an end to this, treat yourself with Deep Harmony :: peace. Or just help us help others :-)</p>
<p><b>Please give us your ideas</b> on what we could do in order to make this campaign more successful - feedback, hints, anything!<br/></p>
<p><b>Please pass it on!</b> I am sure you have kind and sensitive friends who frequently find themselves in the highly unpleasant state of long-term stress, struggling to get to sleep at night, and wishing for a non-drug solution. Let them know about this! (Many are closet sensitives. So please tell <b>all</b> your friends about it!)</p>

<h3>The difference you make</h3>
<p>You give us the opportunity to do what we like and know best: support the sensitive, creative, empathic, caring and idealistic people out there, so they are less hindered by unfavourable frameworks, encroachments and environmental influences.</p>
<p>How this will influence the world we live in? Hard to say, but I do know that the people who can benefit most from <b>Deep Harmony :: peace</b> are amongst those that have an inherent desire to make the world a better place for everyone, and many of them have plenty of skills and talents to make a meaningful contribution. Chronic over-stimulation can turn even nice and gentle people into a pain-in-the-neck, that can't help but pass their stress on to those around them. Chronic stress can be crippling and shorten life-spans considerably. If more and more creative, idealistic and sensitive people are freed from it's negative aftereffects - God knows what will happen!?</p>

<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>If you have been reading so far, I assume that you are one of those creative, empathic sensitives yourself - regardless if you are blessed with sound sleep or have a hard time unwinding. So you have probably already grasped it all, I won't be telling you anything new here:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To help make this world a better place has intrinsic satisfaction to it - and helping those that are destined to aspire to just that even more so, because it has a nice leverage effect built in.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The gratitude of those friends, that will find relief with this real burden of a chronically high cortisol level might feel a bit embarrassing, but also very nice.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And of course, if it is the 'perk' you choose you will have a great tool for self management at your fingertips. <span><br/></span>(BTW, should you be in dire need for less cortisol, but find yourself flat out broke, write us a message - for every 5 perks ordered we will give one out for free if someone is in genuine need.)<span><br/></span>But whatever situation you are in - please do tell your friends about this right away. We need you and your network! We really really do.</span></li>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F128970328&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F128970328&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F520718283_960.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
</div>
<p>Every <b>Deep Harmony :: peace</b> audio track consists of three layers:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The obvious, audible surface (music and/or nature sounds)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Pink noise - a subtle hissing noise coming in waves</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The binaural beat composition</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of processes that trigger us into unpleasant states of stress and over-stimulation happen subconsciously. So it is the subconscious that is stressed primarily - consciously we often notice only the secondary reactions: sleep evades us, we are less patient with others, react irritated with details, etc. So <b>Deep Harmony :: peace</b> audio tracks work mostly on the subconscious.</p>
<p>Music and nature sounds have a multitude of positive effects on psyche and hormone system, most of which we don't notice consciously. The sound surfaces of the tracks are chosen to be calming and relaxing - which is sometimes a subjective thing.</p>
<p>The background noise is socalled pink noise, the noise that is most common in nature. It contains a harmonized blend all frequencies. Rain, ocean waves, the murmur of a creek, the wind in trees, on grass or on a sand dune - these familiar soundscapes consist in large parts of pink noise. The proper doses of it engenders a feeling of security. Pink noise is also an indispensable technical  part of the composition, needed for it to fully unfold it's desired effect.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Binaural beats</a> layer contains the unique power of the <b>Deep Harmony :: peace</b> compositions. This technique is an efficient means to influence brainwaves, and the resulting moods and states. Chris C. Stewart has brought this art to perfection with the multi-layered x-box harmonics and progressive phasing. Inaudible by the physical ear, the effect unfolds directly within the brain and nervous system.</p>

<p>Binaural beats are heard when the right ear listens to a slightly different tone than the left ear. Usually in acoustics, a beat is an interference between two sounds of slightly different frequencies, perceived as periodic variations in volume whose rate is the difference between the two frequencies. If the binaural compositions are listened to with a headset, the two frequencies only interfere within the brain, which has a profound effect on the brainwaves.</p>
<p>However, the whole is more than the sum of it's parts. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Deep Harmony :: peace</b> audio tracks often take effect in a surprising short time of application, even in cases of chronic over-stimulation.</span></p>

<h3>Instructions for proper use</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Deep Harmony :: peace has to be listened to with a stereo headset</strong>, otherwise it will have little or no effect.</li>
<li>Do not do anything else while listening (like reading, watching TV, etc.). You can just relax, or observe your own reactions to the sounds. The latter will slightly increase the benefits, but both methods are equally fine. It is no problem if you should fall asleep - as a matter of fact it will be hard not to dose off, especially in the evening.</li>
<li>
<b>Absolutely do not drive</b> while listening to <b>Deep Harmony :: peace</b>! You could easily doze off and cause an accident. Don't even think it.</li>
<li>Under no circumstances should you be driving a vehicle, operate power tools or engage in similarly dangerous activities <b>right after</b> having listened to Deep Harmony :: peace. Your alertness and concentration might be impaired for a while.</li>
<li>Listening at any time of the day is possible, with the time right before bedtime being ideal. (If you fall asleep easily, but have a hard time going back to sleep after waking up in the middle of the night, place your audio device next to your bed with the headset plugged in, ready to use. Then if you do wake up at night, just turn on <b>Deep Harmony :: peace</b> and listen to the soothing sounds. Most of the time you will fall asleep within a few minutes.)</li>
<li>Choose a comfortable reclining or laying down position.<br/>
</li>
<li>It is usually sufficient to listen to <b>Deep Harmony:: peace</b> once a day, best in the evening. Two sessions a day is the upper limit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Samples</h3>
<p>Please listen to the soundmask, this is the audible surface of the composition. While it is only slightly involved in creating the desired effect, it can be a major factor in inhibiting the desired effect, e.g. if you psychologically or emotionally react negatively to what you hear.</p>

<h4>Pink Noise</h4>
<p>This is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pink noise</a> version of <b>Deep Harmony :: peace</b> - the listener is simply flooded with constant and steady noise. What appears as a nuisance or absurdity on first thought, turns out to be perfect for coping with a noisy environment. You could say it is next to silence - the perfectly monotonous noise feels very natural (like sitting next to a waterfall - as a matter of fact pink noise is the most common sound in nature), and is just great in masking any other sounds trying to come in from the outside. You do not need to use high volumes to have the pink noise masking voices, music from other sources, doorbells, ringing telephones etc, making them simply disappear.</p>

<h1>Gut schlafen in stressigen Zeiten</h1>
<p>Durch aufmerksames Anhören bestimmter Audio-Dateien werden Psyche und Nervensystem beeinflusst. So kann jeder die Menge an Cortisol (das Stress Hormon, das mit der Zeit Gesundheitsschäden verursacht) effektiv senken, besseren Schlaf und höhere Toleranz für potentiell stressige Situationen erleben.

<h3>Erklärung</h3>
<p>Diese Schlafhilfe wurde ursprünglich für meine Frau entwickelt. Wenn zu viele Dinge in zu kurzer Zeit passierten, oder stressige Situationen vor ihr lagen, dann hatte sie Schwierigkeiten sich in der Nacht zu entspannen und Schlaf zu finden. Auf der Suche nach einer Lösung lernte ich <a href=""http://www.awakenedliving.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://administrivia.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chris C. Stewart</a> kennen. Wir bildeten ein online-Team (er lebt in Australien und ich in Österreich), und gemeinsam entwickelten wir ein spezielles Klangwerkzeug.</p>
<p>Unser Arbeitstitel war ""Quick Fix"" (frei übersetzt ""Schnelle Hilfe""), später nannten wir es<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Deep Harmony :: peace</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> (Tiefe Harmonie :: Friede), wegen der erlebten Wirkung. Meine Frau war glücklich! Es funktioniert einfach hervorragen. Das Anhören dieser Komposition reduziert den Cortisolspiegel bei ihr und bei den meisten Menschen, was bei chronsichen Stresszuständen Anspannung nimmt und Erleichterung bringt. So beschlossen wir, die Komposition als CD der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten. Das kam ganz gut an und bis heute haben wir über 3000 CDs verkauft.</span></p>
<p>Das sind echte CDs die wir zum Postamt tragen und nach D, A und CH versenden. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Aber wir wissen, dass es in der Welt überall viele gestresste Sensible gibt! Überstimulierte Menschen die sich oft und oft eine chemiefreie Einschlafhilfe wünschen, die ihnen Entspannung und echte Erholung ermöglicht. Viele von denen haben heute gar keine CD-Player mehr. Wir möchten auch ihnen eine Lösung bieten.</span></p>
<p>Deshalb wollen wir uns jetzt international aufstellen. Und dazu brauchen wir deine Hilfe!</p>
<ul>
<li>Für diesen Schritt brauchen wir Geld für einen Webshop mit Download Logistik und online Zahlungsmöglichkeit</li>
<li>Und wir brauchen vor allem Publicity: Menschen die das benötigen müssen wissen, dass es das gibt!</li>
</ul>
<p>Diese Kampagne soll uns beides bringen, wobei die Publicity mit Abstand das Wichtigere ist. Wenn wir unsere finanziellen Ziele nicht erreichen wird trotzdem alles stattfinden, es wird nur länger dauern. Aber Menschen, die in Stresszeiten Schlafprobleme haben, müssen davon wissen!</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Bitte unterstütze uns!</b> Vielleicht hast du ja auch selbst Schlafprobleme in herausfordernden Zeiten. Nimm das nicht länger hin, gönne dir Deep Harmony :: peace. Oder unterstütze uns einfach so :-)</p>
<p><b>Bitte sag uns deine Ideen!</b> Was könnten wir tun um diese Kampagne erfolgreicher zu machen? Feedback, Anregungen, Tipps, alles.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Bitte sage es auch weiter!</b> Du hast sicherlich liebe und sensitive Freunde, die sich immer wieder im sehr unangenehmen Zustand von Langzeit-Stress befinden. Informiere sie! (Denk daran, viele verbergen ihre Sensitivität und ihre Probleme damit. Deshalb erzähle am besten allen Freunden davon ;)</p>

<h3>Was das für uns bedeutet</h3>
<p>Du eröffnest uns die Gelegenheit, weltweit das zu tun was wir gerne tun und gut können: die sensitiven, kreativen, emphatischen, systemisch denkenden und idealistischen Menschen dieser Welt zu unterstützen, auf dass sie weniger von ungünstigen Rahmenbedingungen und Beeinträchtigungen gehindert werden, glücklich und erfolgreich in der Welt zu wirken.</p>
<p>Wie das unsere Welt beeinflussen wird? Schwer zu sagen, aber ich weiß, dass der Großteil der Menschen, die am meisten von Deep Harmony :: peace profitieren können, ein innewohnendes Bedürfnis haben die Welt für uns alle zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Viele von ihnen haben viele Talente und Fähigkeiten, um einen wirklich bedeutenden Beitrag leisten zu können. Andererseits kann chronische Überstimulation auch nette und sanfte Menschen zu echten Nervensägen machen, weil sie unweigerlich Stress weitergeben. Chronischer Stress kann auch fähige Menschen lahmlegen. Wenn nun mehr und mehr Menschen von den Nachwirkungen dieser Plage befreit werden und mehr aus ihrer Power leben können - da kann viel passieren!</p>

<h3>Was hast du davon?</h3>
<p>Wenn du bis hierher gelesen hast vermute ich, dass du selbst einer von diesen kreativen, sensiblen, systemischen Denkern und Fühlern bist - unabhängig davon, ob du mit gutem Schlaf gesegnet bist oder nicht. Somit hast du wahrscheinlich schon alles erfasst, und ich werde dir hier nichts Neues erzählen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mitzuarbeiten an der Verbesserung der Welt hat eine innewohnende Befriedigung - und denen zu helfen, die dazu neigen sich diesem hohen Ziel zu widmen, noch mehr, weil da die Hebelwirkung dazukommt.</li>
<li>Die Dankbarkeit jener Freunde, die genau durch dieses Mittel große Erleichterung von dieser sehr realen Belastung eines chronisch erhöhten Cortisol-Spiegels finden werden, wird dir vielleicht etwas peinlich sein. Aber es wird sich gut anfühlen.</li>
<li>Und natürlich, falls du diesen Perk (=Belohnung) auswählst, hast du für dich selbst ein wunderbares Werkzeug zur Verfügung, um dein Leben belastungsfreier zu gestalten. <br/>(Apropos: wenn du deinen Cortisol-Spiegel ganz dringen senken musst, aber völlig pleite bist, schreib uns - pro 5 angeforderten Perks vergeben wir Deep Harmony :: peace einmal gratis.)<br/>Aber egal in welcher Situation du dich findest - bitte sag es gleich an deine Freunde weiter. Wir brauchen dich und dein Netzwerk wirklich!</li>

Sleep Well in Stressful Times
By listening to a certain tune that directly influences the neural system anyone can effectively lower one's levels of cortisol (the stress hormone that causes long-term health damage), and experience better sleep and higher tolerance for potentially stressful situations. We want to make this available to everyone.

Das Gleiche auf Deutsch (The same thing in German)


Explanation
This was originally designed for my wife, because when too many things happened in too short a time, she had a hard time trying to unwind and find rest at night. In search for a solution I got to know Chris C. Stewart. We developed an online working relationship (he is in Australia and I am in Austria ;-) and together we created a nice little audio tool.
Our working title was ""Quick Fix"", but later we called it Deep Harmony :: peace. My wife was happy! It works like a charm. Listening to it remarkably reduced cortisol levels in her, and does so in most people. So we decided to offer it to the wider community. First we burnt each CD on my home PC, then demand grew and we had them pressed. To date we have sold just over 3000 CDs.

This was physical CDs, taken to the post office, delivered to Austria, Germany and Switzerland. But we know there are way too many stressed sensitives all over the planet! Over-stimulated people, in daily need of a non-drug aid that helps them to unwind and recuperate. And many of them don't even own CD-players any more. We want to meet their needs too.
In order to do this we are now going international. And that's where you come in!

We need money for a web-shop with online payment and download logistics
We need publicity: people who need it need to know about it!

This campaign is supposed to serve both ends, with the publicity being by far the more important one. If we don't quite meet our financial goals it will still happen, it will just take much longer. But it is essential that people know about this.
Please support us! Maybe you have sleeping problems yourself in challenging times. Put an end to this, treat yourself with Deep Harmony :: peace. Or just help us help others :-)
Please give us your ideas on what we could do in order to make this campaign more successful - feedback, hints, anything!
Please pass it on! I am sure you have kind and sensitive friends who frequently find themselves in the highly unpleasant state of long-term stress, struggling to get to sleep at night, and wishing for a non-drug solution. Let them know about this! (Many are closet sensitives. So please tell all your friends about it!)



The difference you make
You give us the opportunity to do what we like and know best: support the sensitive, creative, empathic, caring and idealistic people out there, so they are less hindered by unfavourable frameworks, encroachments and environmental influences.
How this will influence the world we live in? Hard to say, but I do know that the people who can benefit most from Deep Harmony :: peace are amongst those that have an inherent desire to make the world a better place for everyone, and many of them have plenty of skills and talents to make a meaningful contribution. Chronic over-stimulation can turn even nice and gentle people into a pain-in-the-neck, that can't help but pass their stress on to those around them. Chronic stress can be crippling and shorten life-spans considerably. If more and more creative, idealistic and sensitive people are freed from it's negative aftereffects - God knows what will happen!?



What's in it for you?
If you have been reading so far, I assume that you are one of those creative, empathic sensitives yourself - regardless if you are blessed with sound sleep or have a hard time unwinding. So you have probably already grasped it all, I won't be telling you anything new here:



To help make this world a better place has intrinsic satisfaction to it - and helping those that are destined to aspire to just that even more so, because it has a nice leverage effect built in.

The gratitude of those friends, that will find relief with this real burden of a chronically high cortisol level might feel a bit embarrassing, but also very nice.
And of course, if it is the 'perk' you choose you will have a great tool for self management at your fingertips. (BTW, should you be in dire need for less cortisol, but find yourself flat out broke, write us a message - for every 5 perks ordered we will give one out for free if someone is in genuine need.)But whatever situation you are in - please do tell your friends about this right away. We need you and your network! We really really do.




How does it work?



Every Deep Harmony :: peace audio track consists of three layers:



The obvious, audible surface (music and/or nature sounds)


Pink noise - a subtle hissing noise coming in waves


The binaural beat composition


The majority of processes that trigger us into unpleasant states of stress and over-stimulation happen subconsciously. So it is the subconscious that is stressed primarily - consciously we often notice only the secondary reactions: sleep evades us, we are less patient with others, react irritated with details, etc. So Deep Harmony :: peace audio tracks work mostly on the subconscious.
Music and nature sounds have a multitude of positive effects on psyche and hormone system, most of which we don't notice consciously. The sound surfaces of the tracks are chosen to be calming and relaxing - which is sometimes a subjective thing.
The background noise is socalled pink noise, the noise that is most common in nature. It contains a harmonized blend all frequencies. Rain, ocean waves, the murmur of a creek, the wind in trees, on grass or on a sand dune - these familiar soundscapes consist in large parts of pink noise. The proper doses of it engenders a feeling of security. Pink noise is also an indispensable technical  part of the composition, needed for it to fully unfold it's desired effect.
The Binaural beats layer contains the unique power of the Deep Harmony :: peace compositions. This technique is an efficient means to influence brainwaves, and the resulting moods and states. Chris C. Stewart has brought this art to perfection with the multi-layered x-box harmonics and progressive phasing. Inaudible by the physical ear, the effect unfolds directly within the brain and nervous system.


""WaveInterference"" by Adjwilley - Own work. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0via Wikimedia Commons
Binaural beats are heard when the right ear listens to a slightly different tone than the left ear. Usually in acoustics, a beat is an interference between two sounds of slightly different frequencies, perceived as periodic variations in volume whose rate is the difference between the two frequencies. If the binaural compositions are listened to with a headset, the two frequencies only interfere within the brain, which has a profound effect on the brainwaves.
However, the whole is more than the sum of it's parts. Deep Harmony :: peace audio tracks often take effect in a surprising short time of application, even in cases of chronic over-stimulation.



Instructions for proper use


Deep Harmony :: peace has to be listened to with a stereo headset, otherwise it will have little or no effect.
Do not do anything else while listening (like reading, watching TV, etc.). You can just relax, or observe your own reactions to the sounds. The latter will slightly increase the benefits, but both methods are equally fine. It is no problem if you should fall asleep - as a matter of fact it will be hard not to dose off, especially in the evening.

Absolutely do not drive while listening to Deep Harmony :: peace! You could easily doze off and cause an accident. Don't even think it.
Under no circumstances should you be driving a vehicle, operate power tools or engage in similarly dangerous activities right after having listened to Deep Harmony :: peace. Your alertness and concentration might be impaired for a while.
Listening at any time of the day is possible, with the time right before bedtime being ideal. (If you fall asleep easily, but have a hard time going back to sleep after waking up in the middle of the night, place your audio device next to your bed with the headset plugged in, ready to use. Then if you do wake up at night, just turn on Deep Harmony :: peace and listen to the soothing sounds. Most of the time you will fall asleep within a few minutes.)
Choose a comfortable reclining or laying down position.

It is usually sufficient to listen to Deep Harmony:: peace once a day, best in the evening. Two sessions a day is the upper limit.




Samples
Please listen to the soundmask, this is the audible surface of the composition. While it is only slightly involved in creating the desired effect, it can be a major factor in inhibiting the desired effect, e.g. if you psychologically or emotionally react negatively to what you hear.
el-Hadra
The el-Hadra version of Deep Harmony :: peace that has been sold more than 3000 times (as CD). The first 5 minutes are a beautiful introduction played solo by Klaus Wiese on the harp, then Ted de Jong joins him on the tablas, and shortly thereafter the music stabilizes itself into the rhythm you hear on the sample.


Pink Noise
This is the pink noise version of Deep Harmony :: peace - the listener is simply flooded with constant and steady noise. What appears as a nuisance or absurdity on first thought, turns out to be perfect for coping with a noisy environment. You could say it is next to silence - the perfectly monotonous noise feels very natural (like sitting next to a waterfall - as a matter of fact pink noise is the most common sound in nature), and is just great in masking any other sounds trying to come in from the outside. You do not need to use high volumes to have the pink noise masking voices, music from other sources, doorbells, ringing telephones etc, making them simply disappear.


Water and Birds
This is the version of Deep Harmony :: peace that is best suited for listening during the day, for it is pleasing, relaxing and refreshing at the same time.

Für unsere deutschsprachigen Unterstützer:

Gut schlafen in stressigen Zeiten
Durch aufmerksames Anhören bestimmter Audio-Dateien werden Psyche und Nervensystem beeinflusst. So kann jeder die Menge an Cortisol (das Stress Hormon, das mit der Zeit Gesundheitsschäden verursacht) effektiv senken, besseren Schlaf und höhere Toleranz für potentiell stressige Situationen erleben. Das wollen wir verfügbar machen.

Erklärung
Diese Schlafhilfe wurde ursprünglich für meine Frau entwickelt. Wenn zu viele Dinge in zu kurzer Zeit passierten, oder stressige Situationen vor ihr lagen, dann hatte sie Schwierigkeiten sich in der Nacht zu entspannen und Schlaf zu finden. Auf der Suche nach einer Lösung lernte ich Chris C. Stewart kennen. Wir bildeten ein online-Team (er lebt in Australien und ich in Österreich), und gemeinsam entwickelten wir ein spezielles Klangwerkzeug.
Unser Arbeitstitel war ""Quick Fix"" (frei übersetzt ""Schnelle Hilfe""), später nannten wir es Deep Harmony :: peace (Tiefe Harmonie :: Friede), wegen der erlebten Wirkung. Meine Frau war glücklich! Es funktioniert einfach hervorragen. Das Anhören dieser Komposition reduziert den Cortisolspiegel bei ihr und bei den meisten Menschen, was bei chronsichen Stresszuständen Anspannung nimmt und Erleichterung bringt. So beschlossen wir, die Komposition als CD der Öffentlichkeit anzubieten. Das kam ganz gut an und bis heute haben wir über 3000 CDs verkauft.
Das sind echte CDs die wir zum Postamt tragen und nach D, A und CH versenden. Aber wir wissen, dass es in der Welt überall viele gestresste Sensible gibt! Überstimulierte Menschen die sich oft und oft eine chemiefreie Einschlafhilfe wünschen, die ihnen Entspannung und echte Erholung ermöglicht. Viele von denen haben heute gar keine CD-Player mehr. Wir möchten auch ihnen eine Lösung bieten.
Deshalb wollen wir uns jetzt international aufstellen. Und dazu brauchen wir deine Hilfe!

Für diesen Schritt brauchen wir Geld für einen Webshop mit Download Logistik und online Zahlungsmöglichkeit
Und wir brauchen vor allem Publicity: Menschen die das benötigen müssen wissen, dass es das gibt!

Diese Kampagne soll uns beides bringen, wobei die Publicity mit Abstand das Wichtigere ist. Wenn wir unsere finanziellen Ziele nicht erreichen wird trotzdem alles stattfinden, es wird nur länger dauern. Aber Menschen, die in Stresszeiten Schlafprobleme haben, müssen davon wissen!
Bitte unterstütze uns! Vielleicht hast du ja auch selbst Schlafprobleme in herausfordernden Zeiten. Nimm das nicht länger hin, gönne dir Deep Harmony :: peace. Oder unterstütze uns einfach so :-)
Bitte sag uns deine Ideen! Was könnten wir tun um diese Kampagne erfolgreicher zu machen? Feedback, Anregungen, Tipps, alles.
Bitte sage es auch weiter! Du hast sicherlich liebe und sensitive Freunde, die sich immer wieder im sehr unangenehmen Zustand von Langzeit-Stress befinden. Informiere sie! (Denk daran, viele verbergen ihre Sensitivität und ihre Probleme damit. Deshalb erzähle am besten allen Freunden davon ;)



Was das für uns bedeutet
Du eröffnest uns die Gelegenheit, weltweit das zu tun was wir gerne tun und gut können: die sensitiven, kreativen, emphatischen, systemisch denkenden und idealistischen Menschen dieser Welt zu unterstützen, auf dass sie weniger von ungünstigen Rahmenbedingungen und Beeinträchtigungen gehindert werden, glücklich und erfolgreich in der Welt zu wirken.
Wie das unsere Welt beeinflussen wird? Schwer zu sagen, aber ich weiß, dass der Großteil der Menschen, die am meisten von Deep Harmony :: peace profitieren können, ein innewohnendes Bedürfnis haben die Welt für uns alle zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Viele von ihnen haben viele Talente und Fähigkeiten, um einen wirklich bedeutenden Beitrag leisten zu können. Andererseits kann chronische Überstimulation auch nette und sanfte Menschen zu echten Nervensägen machen, weil sie unweigerlich Stress weitergeben. Chronischer Stress kann auch fähige Menschen lahmlegen. Wenn nun mehr und mehr Menschen von den Nachwirkungen dieser Plage befreit werden und mehr aus ihrer Power leben können - da kann viel passieren!



Was hast du davon?
Wenn du bis hierher gelesen hast vermute ich, dass du selbst einer von diesen kreativen, sensiblen, systemischen Denkern und Fühlern bist - unabhängig davon, ob du mit gutem Schlaf gesegnet bist oder nicht. Somit hast du wahrscheinlich schon alles erfasst, und ich werde dir hier nichts Neues erzählen:

Mitzuarbeiten an der Verbesserung der Welt hat eine innewohnende Befriedigung - und denen zu helfen, die dazu neigen sich diesem hohen Ziel zu widmen, noch mehr, weil da die Hebelwirkung dazukommt.
Die Dankbarkeit jener Freunde, die genau durch dieses Mittel große Erleichterung von dieser sehr realen Belastung eines chronisch erhöhten Cortisol-Spiegels finden werden, wird dir vielleicht etwas peinlich sein. Aber es wird sich gut anfühlen.
Und natürlich, falls du diesen Perk (=Belohnung) auswählst, hast du für dich selbst ein wunderbares Werkzeug zur Verfügung, um dein Leben belastungsfreier zu gestalten. (Apropos: wenn du deinen Cortisol-Spiegel ganz dringen senken musst, aber völlig pleite bist, schreib uns - pro 5 angeforderten Perks vergeben wir Deep Harmony :: peace einmal gratis.)Aber egal in welcher Situation du dich findest - bitte sag es gleich an deine Freunde weiter. Wir brauchen dich und dein Netzwerk wirklich!




Wie funktioniert das?
Jede unserer Deep Harmony CDs besteht aus mehreren Teilen, bzw. Lagen:



die deutlich hörbare Oberfläche (Musik und/oder Naturgeräusche)


das mit etwas Aufmerksamkeit auch noch hörbaren Rauschen


die Komposition binauraler Rhythmen


Der Großteil der Prozesse, die uns in die unangenehmen Zustände von Stress und Überstimulation versetzen, laufen unbewusst ab. Gestresst ist somit in erster Linie das Unterbewusstsein – bewusst bemerkst du oft nur die sekundären Auswirkungen: du kannst vielleicht nicht einschlafen, hast weniger Geduld mit anderen, reagierst gereizt auf relative Kleinigkeiten, etc. Deshalb wirken die Deep Harmony Audios in erster Linie auf das Unterbewusste.
Musik und Naturgeräusche haben vielerlei Wirkungen auf Psyche und Hormonsystem, die der bewussten Aufmerksamkeit größtenteils entgehen. Die hörbaren Teile der CD sind so gewählt, dass sie beruhigend und entspannend wirken - was natürlich subjektiv unterschiedlich ist.
Das Rauschen ist sogenanntes Rosa Rauschen, das in der Natur am häufigsten vorkommende Geräusch, das eine harmonische Mischung sämtlicher hörbaren Frequenzen enthält. Egal ob Regen, Meereswellen, Bachgeplätscher oder der Wind in Bäumen, Grashalmen oder auf Sand – diese vertrauten Geräuschkulissen bestehen zu großen Teilen aus Rosa Rauschen. Die richtige Dosis davon vermittelt Sicherheit. Daüber hinaus wird das Rauschen aus technischen Gründen benötigt, damit die binauralen Klänge ihre volle Wirkung entfalten können.
Die binauralen Rhythmen beinhalten die eigentliche Power von Deep Harmony. Ist diese Technik an sich schon ein mächtiges Mittel, um bestimmte Gehirnwellen – und die damit verbundenen Stimmungen und Zustände – herbeizuführen, so wurde dies von Chris C. Stewart in den mehrstimmigen ""x-box harmonics"" und mit progressivem Abstimmen der Phasen zur Perfektion gebracht. Mit dem bewussten Ohr überhaupt nicht hörbar (das von manchen Menschen ""gehörte"" Pulsieren ist eine reine elektrische Schwingung im Gehirn), entfaltet sich die Wirkung direkt auf das Nervensystem.
Doch das Ganze ist mehr als die Summe seiner Teile. Deep Harmony CDs wirken oft verblüffend schnell, auch in Fällen chronischer Über-Stimulation.



Gebrauchsanleitung

Deep Harmony muss man mit Stereo Kopfhörern anhören. Andernfalls hat es kaum oder keinen Effekt.
Mache nebenbei nichts anderes (wie z. B. lesen, fernsehen, surfen, etc.). Du kannst dich entweder einfach entspannen, oder - was die Wirkung verbessert - deine eigenen Reaktionen auf die Klänge beobachten. Wenn du dabei einschlafen solltest ist es nicht schlimm. Tatsache ist, dass es sich v. a. abends schwer vermeiden lässt einzunicken.

Auf gar keinen Fall darfst du ein Auto; Motorrad oder auch nur ein Fahrrad lenken, während du dir Deep Harmony anhörst. Die Gefahr ist groß, dass du einnickst oder in deiner Aufmerksamkeit beeinträchtigt bist und dich und/oder andere in Lebensgefahr bringst. Denk nicht mal dran.
Jede Tageszeit ist möglich, besonders geeignet ist die Zeit unmittelbar vor dem Schlafengehen. Bei Durchschlafschwierigkeiten kannst du den Audio-Player mit Kopfhörern bereitlegen, und dir den Soundtrack in der Nacht anhören.
Auf keinen Fall solltest du unmittelbar danach Autofahren, mit schwerem Werkzeug arbeiten oder ähnlich gefährliche Dinge tun. Deine Konzentrationsfähigkeit oder Präsenz kann eine Zeitlang beeinträchtigt sein.
Die CD einmal täglich - abens - anzuhören, sollte ausreichen, von mehr als zwei Sitzungen pro Tag wird dringend abgeraten.
Wähle eine bequeme sitzende oder liegende Stellung; aufrechte Meditationshaltung ist nicht erforderlich.




Hörproben
Bitte hör dir die Klangmaske an, das ist die deutlich hörbare Oberfläche der Komposition. Sie spielt zwar eine geringe Rolle im Erzeugen des gewünschten Effektes, kann aber ein ausschlaggebender Faktor sein, um die Entspannung zu verhindern, nämlich wenn du psychologisch oder emotional negativ auf das was du hörst reagierst.
el-Hadra
Die el-Hadra Version von Deep Harmony :: peace wurde bereits mehr als 3000 mal verkauft  (als CD). Die ersten 5 Minuten sind eine sehr lyrische Einleitung, von Klaus Wiese als Solo auf der Harfe gespielt. Dann gesellt sich Ted de Jong an den Tablas hinzu, und bald danach stabilisiert sich die Musik in den Rhythmus, den du in der Hörprobe hören kannst.

Du musst es dafür gar nicht sehr laut aufdrehen, das Rosa Rauschen verschluckt Stimmen, Musik von anderen Quellen, Straßenlärm, Telefonläuten etc., so dass sie einfach verschwinden.


Wasser und Vögel
Diese Version von Deep Harmony :: peace ist am besten dafür geeignet, untertags gehört zu werden. Sie ist heiter, entspannend und belebend zugleich.

Water
is the most important resource that the human race needs to survive, besides
air, but
unfortunately many Countries and regions around the World are facing severe
Water shortages. According to the United Nation, about 1.2 Billion people do
not have access to safe drinking water and by 2025 the number will increase to
about 1.8 Billion. About 3.6 Million people die yearly from consequences of
water, sanitation and hygiene-related diseases, these mostly children under the
age of 5. In the developing Countries, especially in the sub-Sahara Africa,
over 40 Percent lack access to safe drinking water. Over 400 Million school
days are lost yearly from water related illness. Millions of Women and Children
spend several hours a day collecting water. Children and women are on these
often arduous paths victims of sexual violence and abuse.

We have kept the dimensions and contours of the beloved original MYBB but as you can see, the side pieces have been completely removed, making the MYBB ECO2 lighter, stronger, and more portable,  it weighs less than one 1 KG and we  reduced the price by 50%. We have also improved its design by relying on steam-press Indian technology to bend the plywood to the perfect curve. The MYBB ECO2 is crafted from sustainably-harvested Indian medicinal neem wood - a strong and aromatic wood revered for its medicinal properties. Only eco-grade glues and polishes are used during the manufacturing and hand-finishing process to create the ultimate sustainable, ecologically-friendly back bender.The MYBB ECO2’s strong and sturdy design is perfect for use in yoga shalas and gyms. Attractive natural sustainable timber, individually hand-finished. Eco-friendly. Reduced shipping and retail costs, making it more affordable for future customers.

What We Need & What You Get in Return.

We need your help to pre-sell 150 units and get this improved Mysore Yoga Back Bender into the international market. This sleek designed product will benefit hundreds, if not thousands, of people with back and chest pain as well as all those inspiring yogis who are on the quest to go 'Deeper'.

The $15,000 campaign target will be distributed as per the graph below.
We are offering the MYBB ECO2 at a discounted rate and including international delivery to our esteemed backers. This is a saving on the standard MRP post campaign cost!
Shala owners, body workers, and practice groups can take advantage of our shala packs which contain either 6 or 12 pieces. The packs are great for distribution amongst family and friends!
If we do not reach our total funding goal, we are still committed to deliver the MYBB ECO 2 to our backers. We will invest our own capital for the mold and for an initial minimum production run. ""We are committed to delivering this improved product!""
Impact of the new MYBB ECO2
This crowdfunding campaign is asking for your support to help us cover the costs of creating the initial mold and design and manufacture costs by pre selling 150 units. Pre-sales will help us bring this unique, much-needed therapeutic aid to the international market at a much lower cost than the original MYBB.
We know we can produce the product with ease! The cost of the initial mold and design makes the investment hard for us, but if we are able to get the support of the community by pre selling 150 units, we can easily overcome any financial obstacle!
We have overcome many problems along our journey with the earlier, more complex Mysore Yoga Back Bender. We are fully equipped to handle any problem which could arise with this project, as our manufacturing team have proved many times over the last 6 years!

<h3>What is the FlyFit Lifestyle?</h3>

<p>FlyFit Lifestyle is a health &amp; wellness concept visualized by Curtis &amp; Alexis Washington, husband and wife entrepreneurs residing in Denver, CO. </p>
<p>We are fitness professionals looking to step outside of traditional ""training"" methods and bring our unique brand of Lifestyle Coaching to the world.  While working in the fitness industry for 3 years as a personal trainer in a large corporate gym setting, I (Curtis) began to notice that many of my clients would only take their fitness seriously within that hour of face time, only to go back to their not-so-healthy habits when they leave.  This causes any results they may have earned in the gym to be negated.  The psychological toll that hindered progress takes on someone can even cause them to throw in the towel on their fitness.</p>
<p>As a Health Coach, Alexis deals with the mental aspects of wellness with her clients, as well as educating them on proper nutrition from a holistic approach.  While her clients take care of themselves and their nutrition, we both noticed their level of physical fitness to be minimal. Analyzing the struggles we have been facing with our clients, we noticed that our programs fit together like puzzle pieces.  From here, we created the FlyFit Fitness Trifecta:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467730485/wvcfejc95dh8ukatmrm0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have believe that fitness is achieved beyond the gym... it even goes beyond the kitchen... in fact, fitness BEGINS mentally with a positive, goal-oriented mindset, encompasses physical training and proper nutrition, and fully manifests itself through a higher quality of life; LIFESTYLE FITNESS!</p>
<p>Each program includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bi-Weekly Lifestyle Assessment &amp; Goal Setting Sessions</li>
<li>Weekly Physical Activity Program &amp; Log Based on Individual Goals</li>
<li>Weekly Meal Plan &amp; Log Based on Individual Goals</li>
<li>Access to Curtis &amp; Alexis for the Duration of your Program to Address any Questions or concerns</li>
<li>Motivation &amp; Accountability</li>
</ul>
<p>Through our free community fitness events and webinars, we have been able to reach many people who love what we are doing.  We want to expand by doing online fitness events (boot camps and classes via webcam), larger webinars and classes, and online coaching, making Lifestyle Fitness convenient and accessible to people across the world. We believe in this concept so much and want to dedicate our lives to helping individuals worldwide experience their greatest mental, physical, and spiritual potential.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make our dream of changing lives through Lifestyle Fitness a reality, we need help.  As you may know, being an entrepreneur can involve a lot of out-of-pocket funding, and we have put a great deal of our personal finances into this machine.  For us to take this to the next level, we are asking for $5000 to:</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge we have faced so far is funding.  We have had to personally finance every aspect of this business, even the trial and error.  This has caused us to go into a bit of debt.  A huge reason we are seeking help through IndieGoGo is to avoid sinking further into debt.  With a little help, we truly believe we can get past the minor obstacles and succeed.</p>
<p>In terms of risk, there are a few things we have definitely taken into consideration.  In implementing online programs, there will be a few kinks to work out in the early stages.  Luckily, I have a few colleagues that know a great deal about online programs and can guide us once we have the necessary pieces in place.</p>
<p>It is through perseverance and steadfast dedication to the success of this product that we will be able to work though any and all obstacles on our quest to bring FlyFit Lifestyle to life.</p>

I never expected that one day I would write a book about cancer. But when I discovered something remarkable about treating this dreaded disease, that all changed. . . .<br/></p>
<p><span>   Two years
ago, my wife Josée was diagnosed with Stage Four lung cancer. Chemotherapy
would help, the doctors told us, but nothing more could be done. They described
her case as terminal. </span></p>
<p><span>    After I got
over the initial shock, I got angry. I
shouted: “<i>Hell, no!</i>” Josée refused to
accept this terrifying verdict, and so did I. We began researching our options.
I found studies of alternative cancer treatments and spent months plowing
through them, hundreds of pages at a time. </span></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">It was a “eureka” moment.</h2>
<p><span>   What was I
looking for? Not theories or speculation, but an ap­proach with genuine <i>science</i> behind it. A treatment that had
been tested and proven to work against cancer. Weeks went by, without success.
My quest seemed fruitless. Some days, I was exhausted. But I persisted. I
wouldn’t give up. </span></p>
<p><b><span>   And then, almost by accident, I discovered
the answer.</span></b> One morn­ing, I booted up

<p><span>   What is <i>paw paw</i>?
I learned that it’s a tree, native to the eastern half of the </span>United States. </p>
<p><span>   Its anti-cancer properties have been studied

<p><span>   <b>But the news got even better.</b> While the
total cost of treatment for an average cancer case can easily run over

$45 per month. That’s not a typo!</span></p>
<p><span>   Applying the information I had read, Josée began
a regimen of <i>paw paw, </i>along with
conventional treat­ments. But the chemo and radiation soon became so intolerably
toxic that her doctors advised us to stop both. She contin­ued taking
paw paw, experiencing no side effects whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><b><span>   Nine months later, she was can­cer-free.</span></b></p>
<h2 align=""center"">How Paw Paw Attacks Cancer</h2>
<p><span>   Josée’s doctors were amazed. Pre­viously,
whenever we had brought up the subject of natural or alternative remedies, they
had been either hostile or clueless.</span></p>
<p><span>   I had an inspiration. I thought: <b>“If this little-known treatment could help
my wife so dramatically, why not other peo­ple?” </b>So I decided to write a
book that would explain—simply, thor­oughly, accurately—everything they need to
know. I felt strongly that this paw paw  should be known by every cancer 
patient. I made the book readable and non-technical—so everyone would understand it.</span></p>
<p><span>  <b> I did exhaustive research on <i>paw paw</i>. </b>The more I discovered, the more I was convinced that it was highly overlooked and

<p>   It costs nothing for an author to do a radio or TV interview. What costs is <i>landing </i>those interviews. This involves mailings, ads, press releases, printing hundreds of copies for reviewers and media people.                                 <br/></p>
<p>   <br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Here's Your Chance to Help!</h2>

And we thank you for your selfless generosity!<br/><br/>   And check out the other PERKS as well—ranging from the e-book copy to lunch with the author to a custom designed poster.<br/></p>

doctors and experts in natural healing, and is fully documented with references
to rele­vant studies. I call the book Your
Fourth Choice: Killing Cancer Cells with Paw Paw - that Little Known Treatment that Grows on Trees.
Paw paw fruit on the tree. Surprisingly, the most powerful paw paw extract is made from the TWIGS, not the fruit.Why Hadn't Anybody Told Us About This?   The book is basically written now, but of course that's just the beginning. It needs to be published and promoted. My publishing company, Foley Square Books, can get the book produced, but that would be of little effect unless we can mount a significant promotional campaign. We have prepared a budget, allowing for printing, editing, indexing, distribution, etc. But the biggest item on the list is advertising and promotion. 
The Need to Spread the Word
   We're a small publishing company, but this is a big effort. We are thinking national TV and radio interviews, magazines, newspapers, book signings, the works. 
   It costs nothing for an author to do a radio or TV interview. What costs is landing those interviews. This involves mailings, ads, press releases, printing hundreds of copies for reviewers and media people.                                 
   
Here's Your Chance to Help!
   Your pledge, large or small, will help. This book can save lives. You can be partof this important crusade. We need you to simply pledge what you can.    If you check out the PERKS above, you'll see that you can get a signed copy of the book (shipped!) for a $25 pledge. And you'll get it even before it's available to the general public!  The minute this fundraising campaign is over, we'll start shipping books to contributors to this Indiegogo effort!
  If you would rather send books to verified cancer patients at no cost to them, you can choose one of the perks headed ""You Get ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!"" And we thank you for your selfless generosity!   And check out the other PERKS as well—ranging from the e-book copy to lunch with the author to a custom designed poster.
   But your greatest reward will be that you have helped many cancer victims—maybe yourself.Here is a sample of the book's contents and the opening pages, including the Preface, Josée's story, and the Table of Contents:

holistic + nicole = holisticole.. finding my name was somewhat easy, getting my feet off the ground is where you come in. 
     
but wait...

Before I go any further, we must first go through a quick holistic nutrition 101.

 


holistic nutritionists are trained professionals who use ""alternative "" or ""natural "" practices to help clients reach optimal health and achieve personal goals. 

 the practice includes using whole fresh foods (from ""earth to table""), nutritional supplements (like vitamins, minerals and herbs), as well as complementary holistic lifestyle recommendations, such as eliminating toxic products from the home, and learning about things like food combining and the true power of your thoughts. 

a holistic nutritionist is someone you may find online though a recipe blogging site, you may be referred to one from your naturopathic doctor, or you may just stumble upon one (such as now). 


here's what makes holistic nutrition different



we don't do ""diets"" - we do lifestyle changes for lasting results. diets will give you the quick results you want, but the results do not last. with holistic nutrition the ideal is for you to both reach + maintain your goals! 
we educate you on correcting nutritional deficiencies. deficiencies in vitamins and minerals can lead to unpleasant symptoms that may cause you to seek medical help.  
we take everything into consideration. we even look at emotions being linked with overall health. (stress and negative thinking patterns are a killer).


 
 
more on holisticole

we find and look into alternative medicine when we are down on our luck with getting help and answers on what is happening inside our body. alternative medicine comes into our lives when we need it most. I believe holistic nutrition is found by word-of-mouth or self-discovery. 
when we are finally fed up of symptoms like:


being constantly tired 
always feeling bloated
having fertility issues or menstrual problems
suffering from environmental allergies or food sensitivities
experiencing dizzy spells
losing concentration + focus
developing unexplained acne + skin problems

So I am asking to all of you to help me and his family to bring him back to his dream and to his life in any how, also sharing this campaign!
He's a 37 years man,  who loves to live and share his energy with all people from wich is surrounded and he wants to come back to share his full power and energy with all of you!


 
thank you to all

I am Nikola, 25 y.o. , from Bulgaria, and my health has been deteriorating for the past 3 years. I am in serious need of help. It took me about 18 months to figure out what exactly is wrong with my body and then an additional 5 months to understand how to heal it most effectively. This is where I am at right now.<p></p><p>              However, since our family’s budget is tight due to the economic crisis, I cannot buy all or even most of the powerful supplements that I need in order to recover from my terrible health problems. The treatment costs are becoming a bigger and bigger burden on my family and I am constantly being put under pressure to get better and start working again. So that’s why I need some help to be able to do the full protocol rather than just half of it, which won’t get me anywhere.</p><p></p><p><b>                                            My health story (short version) :</b></p><p></p><p>              All throughout 2012 I struggled with Candida overgrowth in my upper respiratory tract.

is 34 years old. About a year after she got married she discovered she was
pregnant. During this time she also found a lump in her breast which turned out
to be breast cancer. Unfortunately, she lost the baby shortly after her
diagnosis. Knowing how much her and her partner wanted to have children she
pushed to meet with a fertility specialist to do egg retrieval and embryo
freezing. Unfortunately, after someone offered to be a surrogate for her, they
discovered that their embryos had not survived which means that now Joy's only
options for having a family are to take a break from her endocrine therapy to
have a baby herself, adopt, or wait another five years, when she’s close to 40
years old, to try and get pregnant despite a history of miscarriages in her

<p>Steph was
diagnosed when she was 28 years old. She had been married for nearly a year when she found out and despite dreams of starting a family together her and her
husband decided against her doing any fertility preservation because there just
wasn't really enough time between surgery and chemotherapy. “<i>It was just going to be really tight to try

<p></p>
<p>Janelle was
diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 29. She was prescribed Tamoxifen for
five years which would mean she would be 36 when she finished and she felt that
was too late for her to start a family. 
So, she found an oncologist who was sympathetic and agreed to guide her
in pausing her endocrine therapy to try to have a baby. She said, <i>“I talked to a couple different oncologists
[and] other women with breast cancer. I went online and there didn't really
seem to be any information as to how safe it was or what coming off Tamoxifen [would
do] to the course of [my] treatment so it was really a leap of faith just to
come off it and hope for the best.”</i> She went off Tamoxifen after three
years and it took her four months to get pregnant. She now has a beautiful baby
girl! Janelle said “<i>I look at my daughter
Zara I feel so lucky, so blessed to have her and she's definitely...she's
definitely worth the risk.”</i></p>

Many people are familiar with the treatment protocols of a breast cancer diagnosis including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, but getting through those treatments is not the end of the line for the 70% of women with hormone responsive breast cancers. Most hormone responsive patients follow up their adjuvant treatment with five to ten years of endocrine therapy (such as Tamoxifen) to reduce the chances of recurrence. As a result, a young woman who is diagnosed at age 30 could be 40 by the time she can safely try to start having a family. 
Rethink
Breast Cancer, a Canadian charity whose mission is to empower young people who are concerned about and affected by breast cancer, is asking you to help fund the international Baby Time
(POSITVE) clinical trial in Canada to understand and
overcome the challenges some women face when trying to get
pregnant after cancer.


WHERE THE MONEY GOES
More than 60 breast cancer centres in 20 countries around the world are participating in the Baby Time study. Rethink Breast Cancer has committed to raising $100,000+ over the next 4 years to run the Canadian research arm of this study. But we can't do it without your help!


We need to raise $25,000 in 2015 so that breast cancer centres across Canada can begin enrolling patients as early as this summer. The initial $15,000 we're aiming to raise RIGHT NOW will cover the cost of the very first patients who enter the trial.

It costs
approximately $3,000 for each woman to participate in the trial. This includes
all start up costs to get the study up and running with Health Canada and the
Research Ethics Board as well as:

recruitment and enrollment
nursing staff costs
data collection, analysis and reporting
personalized care by dedicated medical team
coordination of data with all participating centres
follow up of each participant for up to 10 years*
providing the Canadian data to the international centre

By raising $15,000 we will be able to cover the cost of establishing the trial at hospitals across Canada and enrolling the first five women to participate! Money raised beyond this will be used to enroll additional women throughout 2015 and ongoing over the next four years.
*Each woman will be guided through taking a break from their
endocrine therapy (3 months), attempting pregnancy (up to 2 years) and then
monitored (up to 10 years) to track possible recurrence of breast cancer.




WHY DONATE?


The donation you make will directly support the Baby Time study enabling women from all across Canada to participate in the study. Funding the study in Canada, ensures the results will be applicable here, as well as offers Canadian women the opportunity to participate in the research. 
Your money will be used to directly cover the costs involved for participants in the trial and ultimately, provide answers for future generations of young women who wish to interupt their endocrine therapy to try to have a baby and evaluate the safety of doing so.

</div></div>","Who am I?I'm a 37-year-old runner from Bulgaria. A father of 3-year-old kid who loves getting outdoors. I have participated in lots of ultra runs in my home country in the last 5 years and now it is time to tackle one of the most challenging runs in Europe - the UTMB - Courmayeur Champex Chamonix Run. The race is 101 km long (around 63 miles) with 6100 meters positive attitude change. To be part of it you need to collect points from previous runs and then get selected randomly. So I did all that. I'm one of the 1900 athletes from around the world that have the chance to be part of this competition!I want to thank you for getting familiar with my campaign. It means you are considering to support me and I really appreciate that.video from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq0lf8nP8-4What's my goal?To receive enough funding to buy the needed equipment and traveling cost for me and my supporter.The organization of the race is quite strict. You need certain equipment to be allowed to start in the race. Things like high level waterproof jackets and gloves, special socks, etc., which I'm not able to get right now. Also the traveling cost are over my budget. Even though I'm getting a second job, I won't be able to save enough until the deadline of the race. This is why I'm addressing the Indiegogo community of supporters to help me out on this.Where are we now?A local Athletic store offered some of the equipment for free. It's not the complete set but still a major help. Also I'm actively saving for the race and looking for a second job to cover as much as possible of the expenses.How will the money be used?- Buy the expensive equipment that I'm required to have in order to participated in the race.- Get myself and my supporter a plane ticket to Switzerland- Pay for an economy accommodation for both of us.How You Can Help1.  Well, the best way is to contribute - look over the perks and contribute at a level that works for you.2.  Share this campaign and help me spread the word.Please use the ""Share this Campaign"" tool at the top of this page.Re-post our Indiegogo link on your Facebook and Twitter pages",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

Quidditch
is a mixed-gender, full-contact sport. Even though it's only existed for 10 years, it has already spread throughout the world. To
determine which nation has the best quidditch team worldwide, a World Cup is held
every two years. The 2016 edition is going to take place in
Frankfurt, Germany and our goal is to go there. </p>
<p>
We
are the only Korean quidditch team so far and have been around since
September 2015. World Cup is one of our only chances to play
official games and breathe some of the renowned quidditch air, since
we're the only team in this area - the next team is a six-hour flight away.</p>
<p>
But
as we are all students, we need financial help to get there. A round-trip flight from Seoul to Frankfurt costs about 811€ (~920$) and there
are still some other costs to cover. (There is stuff we can do
without, but food is not one of them.) </p>

<p>Dear supporters,</p>
<p><strong>What do we know about the value of things?</strong></p>
<p><em>What do know people who work hard just to survive, about the beautiful in life?</em></p>
<p><em>More than anyone else.</em></p>
<p>Take the mysterious Russian soul, add skill and talent, and heritage, which ancestors provided us. <strong><span>That's who we are.</span></strong></p>
<p>You may have heard the opinion - ''if you meet that Russians create, <strong>it is sad trash''</strong>.<br/><span>They just don't know about us and what we can do.<br/><span>And when it comes to values, we know exactly what is.</span></span></p>
<p>We were <strong>born</strong> in the <strong>Soviet Union</strong>, we remember what the ""<strong>Evil Empire</strong>"".</p>
<p>Very similar, that now people allow it to return.</p>
<p>We do not wish such a future for our children, for anyone.</p>
<p>We just dream of a life worthy of <strong>human dignity</strong>, in society with fair<span> opportunity for each according to ability.</span></p>
<p>The last two years we very hard worked, we have spent<strong> tens of thousands of hours for development </strong>and have traveled many thousands of miles for our customers.</p>
<p>And now we are ready to provide our labor and ourselves to your court, and when you will do the ordering, it will be clear that all was not in vain. </p>
<p>And if we achieve your trust, we will expand our opportunities and we will get a chance of success.</p>
<p>But all, what we strive for, will mean nothing if we can't<strong> help other people</strong>.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we organized a cooperation with AdVita charity foundation.</p>
<p>We hope that your donations will help many children to recover from cancer.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to do what we love.</p>
<p><strong>Share our campaign with the world.</strong></p>

The history of the brand has started long ago, before the birth of our children. Dmitry graduated from Textile University and Ksenia Technical College in the field of textile and garment industry. But with their birth, mother's things on daughters received a praise and approving estimates.

On the advice of many, we have decided to be engaged in the professional creation of a children’s clothing.
So YUMÉ kids wear brand was born.
It is very difficult to start from scratch. It is necessary to work very hard, sleep less, a new to study in much, to deprive itself, but smiles and twinkle in the eyes of the children from clothes are given us forces for tomorrow. Daughters help us models.
We know what at us it turns out to create an interesting, the ""other"" clothing for kids and we wish to share with the world what we can do.




 

Dear supporters,
What do we know about the value of things?
What do know people who work hard just to survive, about the beautiful in life?
More than anyone else.
Take the mysterious Russian soul, add skill and talent, and heritage, which ancestors provided us. That's who we are.
You may have heard the opinion - ''if you meet that Russians create, it is sad trash''.They just don't know about us and what we can do.And when it comes to values, we know exactly what is.
We were born in the Soviet Union, we remember what the ""Evil Empire"".
Very similar, that now people allow it to return.
We do not wish such a future for our children, for anyone.
We just dream of a life worthy of human dignity, in society with fair opportunity for each according to ability.
The last two years we very hard worked, we have spent tens of thousands of hours for development and have traveled many thousands of miles for our customers.
And now we are ready to provide our labor and ourselves to your court, and when you will do the ordering, it will be clear that all was not in vain. 
And if we achieve your trust, we will expand our opportunities and we will get a chance of success.
But all, what we strive for, will mean nothing if we can't help other people.
For this purpose, we organized a cooperation with AdVita charity foundation.
We hope that your donations will help many children to recover from cancer.
Thank you for the opportunity to do what we love.
Share our campaign with the world.

</p>
<p><b>At Sharwaki Foundation, we
believe that it’s a basic human right for everyone to have access to clean
drinking water and electricity at all times</b>.
</p>
<p>We're here to improve these living conditions and help save
some of those innocent children's lives by providing clean drinking water.  </p>
<p>Our mission is to provide water purification equipment to
provide safe clean drinking water to villages that are in need. This will help improve health conditions and save the lives of the innocent people who are dealing with such problems.</p>

<p><b>Campaign Goal: $100,000</b></p>
<p><b>Nsakyi</b>, <b>Otiakrom</b> and <b>Bodumase</b> are 3 villages in Ghana that are farming communities with a <b>high poverty rate</b>.</p>
<p>Following are the detailed expenses
of our campaign to provide water treatment equipments and solar systems to
operate the pumps and the purification systems, since there are no reliable electric services available
in these villages in Ghana:</p>
<p>3 Water Treatment systems (6,000, 4,000 and 3,000 liters/hour): Total $48,600<br/>3 Clean water storage tanks: Total $6,900<br/>3 Solar Systems: Total $29,400<br/>Technicians / installer
travel costs and expenses: $8,800<br/>Construction, materials, supplies &amp;

<p>By reaching our goal, we will have
raised the total costs to deliver, construct and operate 3 systems that will provide the three villages with clean drinking water for thousands of people for many years to come. Any funds we raise through this campaign
that reach above our goal, will go towards our next project to provide the same systems to another village. (We have 15 villages in line waiting for our services.)<br/></p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, your
contribution will go toward a purification system to one or two of these villages.</p>

people are facing every day in remote villages and towns, which force us to act immediately
to make ""Clean Drinking Water for ALL"" a reality.
 


At Sharwaki Foundation, we
believe that it’s a basic human right for everyone to have access to clean
drinking water and electricity at all times.

We're here to improve these living conditions and help save
some of those innocent children's lives by providing clean drinking water.  
Our mission is to provide water purification equipment to
provide safe clean drinking water to villages that are in need. This will help improve health conditions and save the lives of the innocent people who are dealing with such problems.
   What We Need 
Campaign Goal: $100,000
Nsakyi, Otiakrom and Bodumase are 3 villages in Ghana that are farming communities with a high poverty rate.
Following are the detailed expenses
of our campaign to provide water treatment equipments and solar systems to
operate the pumps and the purification systems, since there are no reliable electric services available
in these villages in Ghana:
3 Water Treatment systems (6,000, 4,000 and 3,000 liters/hour): Total $48,6003 Clean water storage tanks: Total $6,9003 Solar Systems: Total $29,400Technicians / installer
travel costs and expenses: $8,800Construction, materials, supplies &
Misc. Expenses: $6,300
By reaching our goal, we will have
raised the total costs to deliver, construct and operate 3 systems that will provide the three villages with clean drinking water for thousands of people for many years to come. Any funds we raise through this campaign
that reach above our goal, will go towards our next project to provide the same systems to another village. (We have 15 villages in line waiting for our services.)
If we do not reach our goal, your
contribution will go toward a purification system to one or two of these villages.
Sharkawi Foundation is in the
process of obtaining the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization tax exemption status.

The Impact 
You contribution will help save children's lives and make a
powerful change that will impact the lives of thousands of people in these villages.
This is an incredible opportunity to make a significant change
and touch the lives of people around the world.  
Become a part of our exciting project and help us improve
the way people live their lives each and every day.
  Other Ways You Can Help 
Any financial contribution is appreciated and will help reach the goal.
However, if you cannot contribute financially, there are many other ways you can help. Please:

Through time, Ayurveda (natural Indian medicine) has always been successful and adaptive to support people. But nowadays people have different needs and life than 5000 years ago! The phone has become a natural daily companion of most of the population, for work, social, calls, bank, games, fitness… Ayurveda needs to take place in this new world to sustain people health. That’s the aim of AloeVeda,</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p><ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">The app will be <strong>partly free with advertising</strong> and <strong>access to main basic Ayurvedic programs</strong>. Indeed we think they Ayurvedic wisdom should be shared and spread everywhere to help people.</li>

</ul><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Why are you crowdfunding?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">After a year of studying the App and Ayurvedic market and working on the concept, we are now ready to take AloeVeda to the next level and make it real. For this, we need your help. We know exactly what to do to successfully bring an app to the market. We’ve broken it up into different milestones so that you know how we will use your contribution.</p><p> </p><h3>About AloeVeda Programs</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>How does it work?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">It uses tests to orient you to the best programs for you, whether it is more oriented to a special imbalance such as hypertension, or to your Ayurvedic profile, or even to learn to keep balanced by following a seasonal program. When you finish a program, you can take a test again to keep working on your long-term balance and health.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>How long are the programs?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Most of the programs will be over 3 months, some shorter. Why?</p><ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Because the first pillar of Ayurveda is nutrition and that restoring the intestinal flora takes time (between 1 to 4 months depending on the people).</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Because making any kind of change in the way you live your daily life is like being on a new path. It takes time for you to settle and to feel comfortable walking on it once started.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Because herbal medicine to be 100% active also needs time.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Because your body naturally changes slowly with your moods, your environment, the seasons. It is not like taking an aspirin when you have a headache. So slow down and enjoy the journey!</li>

All the recent scientific studies confirm the advantages of the vegetarian diet on your health. But for us, it is also a personal choice, because we want to protect the animals. We think that in many countries, Human beings are now lucky enough to be able to choose what they want to do for their health and for the planet. So we decided to provide Vegetarian / Vegan nutrition on the AloeVeda app. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Can you interact with people?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Facebook page and group will allow you to discuss directly with us and together with other AloeVedies to ask questions, share your progress and feedback and create links with other people who feel as much concerned as you by their health.

The first consequence of imbalance is in your Health. You might feel tired, have digestion issues or problems to fall asleep. These are few examples of some of the most common signs of imbalance. AloeVeda provides you with a sustainable way to find your balance with Programs including Nutrition, Lifestyle, and Herbs. Get Personal Programs, Right in your PocketStep 1: Take your constitution and current states testsTo provide you with a program that can fit you the best, you can answer 2 short tests.
The first test tells your Ayurvedic constitution, called Prakruti. It is your state of perfect health from birth.
The second test reveals your current state, called Vikruti. Generally, your current state deviates vs your constitution.
In Ayurveda, we think that problems come when you diverge a long time from your constitution. So first we measure the gap via the tests. Then the aim is to bring you back to balance and so to your initial constitution via nutrition, lifestyle and herbs recommendations. Seems clear? Step 2: Sign in for a programBase on the previous tests, AloeVeda is going to propose the best suitable programs for you. You can also decide for yourself to work towards a special goal. We created many programs for you to face all your needs. Step 3: Get access to all the Ayurvedic recommendations for you Step 4: Be engaged daily in your program to get the best resultsWith AloeVeda, you are active and empowered to reach your goals. Every day, on your Homepage, you will have all your homework for the day, including your meals and snacks, your herbs and 3 things to do for your program. These actions aim to make you be fully in the program! Keep active and motivated! They can be Ayurvedic rituals (oil massage, morning routine to awake the 5 senses, meditation, yoga), healthy tips (eat an apple, no sugar day, no coffee day) or lifestyle advises (hug a friend, take some time to read, go swimming). The aim: to be fun, creative and a bit challenging. Your HomepageThis is an example of a program and the information available each day on your phone! Yes! It really works!AloeVeda is based on Ayurveda, the oldest Naturopathy, coming from India a long time ago. It is a medical science at the same time as preventive and curative, that looks at each individual uniquely as a body, a spirit, and a soul. Ayurveda focuses on balance and treats the causes of your imbalances and not only the symptoms.Ayurveda has been used for more than 5 000 years. The best reason to try this system is that it works for so long that it deserves our attention!AloeVeda combines the ancient knowledge of Ayurveda and all its dimensions (nutrition, lifestyle, and herbs) for nowadays people with an attractive design and a good interface.  Project Timeline Stretch Goals Meet the TeamWe are 2 people who choose to embark on this amazing project together.

Holistic Hilda, the host and producer of the Wise Traditions podcast, is convinced that the key to better health is found in the wisdom of our ancestors. The month-long ancestral health tour in Australia was prompted by a sense of urgency to share ancestral health principles, based on Dr. Weston A. Price's findings nearly 100 years ago, and to learn about traditional health habits that we can incorporate into our own lives wherever we live. </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554141370/uwnrmozgtx8lnwu34zk2.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Three reasons: 1) Dr. Weston A. Price considered the indigenous people of Australia to represent the paradigm of moral and physical perfection. I am eager to learn what I can from those whose heritage is tied to one of the oldest cultures in existence on the planet.  2) Australian WAPF chapter leaders have arranged the itinerary and are excited for me to come and give talks,  conduct interviews, have air time on the radio with health experts, and connect with communities along the east coast of the continent. 3) Outside of the United States, Australia has the biggest listening audience of the Wise Traditions podcast. </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554141762/lfppodkvba0qie8dhrac.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>So what will I be doing exactly? I will be giving talks, conducting interviews, appearing on the radio and more. I am nailing down the itinerary with the help of WAPF chapter leaders in Australia. The tour includes stops in Victoria, Sydney, Northern Rivers, Toowoomba, Northern Territory, and Cairns. I'm particularly excited about the collaboration with those already very involved in sustainable farming/living in Australia, and the possibility of connecting with indigenous peoples. I'm also thrilled that Talk Radio East Side FM is on the schedule, along with a symposium with Dr. Steven Lin, and a presentation with Dr. Ron Ehrlich. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge along the way will probably just be pacing myself. I'm a connector at heart and I envision many opportunities arising spontaneously. I will work hard to make sure every event and outreach will be top notch, while simultaneously making sure to not to over-stuff the schedule</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554141392/j7batz3hlohb1u81xqvw.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>A trip of this magnitude requires significant resources. The Weston A. Price Foundation has offered to sponsor the trip to a degree, but $8000 more is needed to cover flights to and from Australia, transportation within the country (it's BIG), food, lodging, and the hiring of a local videographer/photographer to capture content for future release. </p>
<p>I hope to save money by staying with local chapter leaders! I'm not opposed to couch surfing, either. I also am excited by the prospect of hiring a videographer in Australia, so I don't have to incur unnecessary additional travel costs.</p>
<p>Of course I'll cover plenty of expenses out of pocket. But I just can't pull off this project on my own! A friend in Australia actually was the one who came up with this idea to crowdfund the project. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, gifts of any size are MUCH appreciated! This is a big undertaking and it truly cannot take place without significant support. </p>
<p>On a related money note, what happens if we raise <i>more</i> than expected? Once the basic trip expenses are covered, additional monies will be distributed among a number of communities lifting up ancestral health practices in Australia. And if the campaign goal is <i>not</i> reached, what then? Adjustments will be made in terms of the scope of content captured. (In other words, I might not be able to hire someone to record presentations or interviews or various portions of the experience). But, honestly, this is an important reason I am taking this trip: to bring the information back to the world, so I'd <i>hate </i>to have to do this!  </p>

<p>As mentioned above, monetary support is crucial. If, however, you're not in a position to contribute financially, you can help raise the visibility of the campaign by simply sharing it on social media. Or direct your friends to follow me @holistichilda on Instagram to learn more about this mission to change the world through wise traditions. And thank you!</p>

Three reasons: 1) Dr. Weston A. Price considered the indigenous people of Australia to represent the paradigm of moral and physical perfection. I am eager to learn what I can from those whose heritage is tied to one of the oldest cultures in existence on the planet.  2) Australian WAPF chapter leaders have arranged the itinerary and are excited for me to come and give talks,  conduct interviews, have air time on the radio with health experts, and connect with communities along the east coast of the continent. 3) Outside of the United States, Australia has the biggest listening audience of the Wise Traditions podcast. 

So what will I be doing exactly? I will be giving talks, conducting interviews, appearing on the radio and more. I am nailing down the itinerary with the help of WAPF chapter leaders in Australia. The tour includes stops in Victoria, Sydney, Northern Rivers, Toowoomba, Northern Territory, and Cairns. I'm particularly excited about the collaboration with those already very involved in sustainable farming/living in Australia, and the possibility of connecting with indigenous peoples. I'm also thrilled that Talk Radio East Side FM is on the schedule, along with a symposium with Dr. Steven Lin, and a presentation with Dr. Ron Ehrlich. 
The biggest challenge along the way will probably just be pacing myself. I'm a connector at heart and I envision many opportunities arising spontaneously. I will work hard to make sure every event and outreach will be top notch, while simultaneously making sure to not to over-stuff the schedule

A trip of this magnitude requires significant resources. The Weston A. Price Foundation has offered to sponsor the trip to a degree, but $8000 more is needed to cover flights to and from Australia, transportation within the country (it's BIG), food, lodging, and the hiring of a local videographer/photographer to capture content for future release. 
I hope to save money by staying with local chapter leaders! I'm not opposed to couch surfing, either. I also am excited by the prospect of hiring a videographer in Australia, so I don't have to incur unnecessary additional travel costs.
Of course I'll cover plenty of expenses out of pocket. But I just can't pull off this project on my own! A friend in Australia actually was the one who came up with this idea to crowdfund the project. 
As you can imagine, gifts of any size are MUCH appreciated! This is a big undertaking and it truly cannot take place without significant support. 
On a related money note, what happens if we raise more than expected? Once the basic trip expenses are covered, additional monies will be distributed among a number of communities lifting up ancestral health practices in Australia. And if the campaign goal is not reached, what then? Adjustments will be made in terms of the scope of content captured. (In other words, I might not be able to hire someone to record presentations or interviews or various portions of the experience). But, honestly, this is an important reason I am taking this trip: to bring the information back to the world, so I'd hate to have to do this!  

As mentioned above, monetary support is crucial. If, however, you're not in a position to contribute financially, you can help raise the visibility of the campaign by simply sharing it on social media. Or direct your friends to follow me @holistichilda on Instagram to learn more about this mission to change the world through wise traditions. And thank you!",5.0,0,"3 Campaigns

We soon realised that the magnitude of the healthcare crisis in certain parts of the world are beyond our imagination. </p><h3>The Reality</h3><p>We found that Zimbabwe has 1.6 doctors for every 10,000 people. There are only 2 heart surgeons in the entire country of 15 million.</p><p>We found that in Iraq, lack of equipment and more importantly lack of trained surgeons has created a huge void in healthcare with everyone from babies and young children, to old men and women suffering from lack of medical care.</p><p>Afghanistan today suffers from one of the worst health crises in the world. Years of war and civil strife have left behind enormous poverty, and a crumbling infrastructure. The doctors lack enough training, the hospitals have no equipment and the medicines are often fake. Most medical laboratories and diagnostic centres are unable to diagnose the issues correctly. Moreover, women were banned from receiving treatment from male doctors under Taliban rule, and with few female doctors in the country, many illnesses were left untreated.</p><p>Bangladesh on the other hand is in a much better position than all of these countries. However, the tertiary healthcare infrastructure in Bangladesh is still in its nascent stage and therefore for high end medical procedures patients need to travel outside their country. Doctor training, nurse and paramedic training are areas where private hospitals and looking for collaborations with partners.</p><h3>Our Solutions</h3><p><strong>Online Consultations </strong></p><p>Facilitating online doctor consultations with our own partner doctors for patients in these countries for a very nominal fee, will help balance the doctor patient ratios. We can organise online doctor consultations with female doctors from India for countries where this is a special challenge</p><p><strong>Surgical Camps and Out Patient Consultations </strong></p><p>Working with our 190 partnered doctors and our 10 JCI accredited partner hospitals, and sending them for regular visits for consultations or surgical camps to these countries</p><p><strong>Medical Education &amp; Training</strong></p><p>Organising continuing medical education conferences in these countries for doctors, para medics and nurses</p><p><strong>What $150,000 in crowdfunding would help us achieve</strong></p><p><strong>Infrastructure for online consultations </strong></p><p>Your contribution will help us build an infrastructure to support web based consultations. For this we need space, computers, internet and translators in various countries. </p><p><strong>Subsidize travel for surgeons and doctors</strong></p><p>It would subsidise tickets for surgeons and their teams to go to Baghdad or Kabul or Harare to conduct a few life saving surgeries. It would support travel for doctors to go to these places for regular consultation visits and relieve some of the pressure on the local healthcare systems.</p><p><strong>Support Medical Education &amp; Training</strong></p><p>It would help us conduct doctors medical education conferences, nurses training programs, and paramedical training for our neighbours like Bangladesh. We have a roster of senior doctors and specialist along with senior head nurses and trainers willing to go that extra mile. </p><p>This in turn would turn peoples lives around - save some, make it easier for some, and give a ray of home to many.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get </strong></p><p>We need $150000 to start with.</p><p>Some sample costs.</p><p>For online consultations from other countries we need to rent out small space, have at least 3 computers each with internet connectivity and english translators for our doctors, which would be at least $50k including recurring costs for a year</p><p>A single return flight from New Delhi to Baghdad visa, license or equalization fees for doctors, local transportation, accommodation and security can cost upwards of $3000 for one person alone. A surgical camp usually has teams of 2-3 surgeons, and if required, nursing staff, anaesthetist, assistant surgeons etc.</p><p>We organised a cardiology and orthopaedic medical conference for doctors in Harare in March 2017, which cost us $16836 including tickets, venue, and certification</p><p>For OPD consultations in a place like Kabul, doctors can charge as much as $7500 for a 2.5 day visit due to the security threats.

We soon realised that the magnitude of the healthcare crisis in certain parts of the world are beyond our imagination. The RealityWe found that Zimbabwe has 1.6 doctors for every 10,000 people. There are only 2 heart surgeons in the entire country of 15 million.We found that in Iraq, lack of equipment and more importantly lack of trained surgeons has created a huge void in healthcare with everyone from babies and young children, to old men and women suffering from lack of medical care.Afghanistan today suffers from one of the worst health crises in the world. Years of war and civil strife have left behind enormous poverty, and a crumbling infrastructure. The doctors lack enough training, the hospitals have no equipment and the medicines are often fake. Most medical laboratories and diagnostic centres are unable to diagnose the issues correctly. Moreover, women were banned from receiving treatment from male doctors under Taliban rule, and with few female doctors in the country, many illnesses were left untreated.Bangladesh on the other hand is in a much better position than all of these countries. However, the tertiary healthcare infrastructure in Bangladesh is still in its nascent stage and therefore for high end medical procedures patients need to travel outside their country. Doctor training, nurse and paramedic training are areas where private hospitals and looking for collaborations with partners.Our SolutionsOnline Consultations Facilitating online doctor consultations with our own partner doctors for patients in these countries for a very nominal fee, will help balance the doctor patient ratios. We can organise online doctor consultations with female doctors from India for countries where this is a special challengeSurgical Camps and Out Patient Consultations Working with our 190 partnered doctors and our 10 JCI accredited partner hospitals, and sending them for regular visits for consultations or surgical camps to these countriesMedical Education & TrainingOrganising continuing medical education conferences in these countries for doctors, para medics and nursesWhat $150,000 in crowdfunding would help us achieveInfrastructure for online consultations Your contribution will help us build an infrastructure to support web based consultations. For this we need space, computers, internet and translators in various countries. Subsidize travel for surgeons and doctorsIt would subsidise tickets for surgeons and their teams to go to Baghdad or Kabul or Harare to conduct a few life saving surgeries. It would support travel for doctors to go to these places for regular consultation visits and relieve some of the pressure on the local healthcare systems.Support Medical Education & TrainingIt would help us conduct doctors medical education conferences, nurses training programs, and paramedical training for our neighbours like Bangladesh. We have a roster of senior doctors and specialist along with senior head nurses and trainers willing to go that extra mile. This in turn would turn peoples lives around - save some, make it easier for some, and give a ray of home to many.What We Need & What You Get We need $150000 to start with.Some sample costs.For online consultations from other countries we need to rent out small space, have at least 3 computers each with internet connectivity and english translators for our doctors, which would be at least $50k including recurring costs for a yearA single return flight from New Delhi to Baghdad visa, license or equalization fees for doctors, local transportation, accommodation and security can cost upwards of $3000 for one person alone. A surgical camp usually has teams of 2-3 surgeons, and if required, nursing staff, anaesthetist, assistant surgeons etc.We organised a cardiology and orthopaedic medical conference for doctors in Harare in March 2017, which cost us $16836 including tickets, venue, and certificationFor OPD consultations in a place like Kabul, doctors can charge as much as $7500 for a 2.5 day visit due to the security threats. Our partners would bear some of the costs, but we would like to be able to support some of it in the intial days.We have a staff of 5, operating at the bare minimum. However we need to employ ground support staff for patients and translators as well to be able to communicate with patients from other countries where English is not the main language. We see staff costs going up to $60k this year. The Impact Your contribution will help provide additional resources by sending doctors to these  challenged countries for consultations, and surgeries. You will help provide training to create more nurses and more skilled doctors. You will also help give them cheaper options and access to consultations online with doctors in India. Together we can improve lives and help these countries with very basic healthcare needs that a lot of the world take for granted.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>EZIHOLD's original and very first basic bottle band was designed and made for my mother (Gerry) while she was recovering from cancer. The idea spawned one day in the gym shortly after her surgery. On that day, I noticed every time she bent over to pick up her water bottle off the floor, she would cringe in pain. I wanted to help her in this moment and thought about how... aside from being her personal bottle butler. Now, I couldn't help her with her stitches but I did find a solution that works.</p>
<p>If you have ever been in the gym and put a bottle, towel, keys, card on the ground or knocked over your bottle and forgotten it, then EZIHOLD will help! </p>
<p>And as it turns out many people were experiencing the same issues. The inconvenience of putting their:</p>
<p><strong>Gym card or locker keys-</strong> in their pockets during exercise (if they had pockets) or attaching pins to workout clothes</p>
<p><strong>Water bottle-</strong> trying to find a place that is out of the way, avoiding spills &amp; where you won't forget it) and </p>
<p><strong>Gym towel </strong>(the one you wipe your face with) on the floor</p>
<p>These are all real concerns that needed better a solution.   </p>
<p>Along the way we realised that we were solving not only a safety and convenience issue but a very important hygiene issue. Currently, there is only one third of the gym that allows and provides a safe and sanitary place to put your bottle and personal gym items... the cardio machines. Scattered on the floor in the other two thirds of the gym you'll see water bottles, towels, keys, and cards. This can cause an unsafe and unhygienic gym environment. Plus, it is a pain in the gluteus maximus to carry and place your keys, card and towel in your pocket or on the floor after/ during each exercise or set.</p>
<p>Due to the interest from gym goers asking where they too could get an Ezihold band, I started to develop EZIHOLD's first prototype. Through continuous feedback we've developed the key features which include; a way to attach your keys, your gym card, towel all the while holding your bottle at eye height. </p>
<p>EZIHOLD's patent pending function &amp; design allows you to show your flare with our fantastic colour range whilst not taking away from your water bottles design or function. So, help back  our campaign and take all of that mess and inconvenience and put it on one EZIHOLD band.</p>

<p><strong>Q. How do I know my bottle will hold?</strong></p>
<p>A. There are two main factors: 1) The magnet and 2) the ferrous surface material you attach it too.</p>
<p> 1) The magnet is a strong rare earth magnet with a quality coating protecting it from the elements like water, heat and freezing temperatures. It will hold a bottle up to 700mls or 24Oz easily. 2) The thickness of surface metal you attach your Ezihold to will also the determine it's performance. </p>
<p><strong>Q. How do I choose my colour?</strong></p>
<p>A. The colour selection will happen shortly after purchase.</p>

<p>Due to its design Wiuhu helps you achieve correct knee-nose alignment when training. Stable foot elements guarantee you slide only in the direction your training needs you to. Correct postitioning and the angle of your kick allow you to concentrate your training to the right muscle groups. This gives you more power and speed where it is needed – on the ice.</p>

<p>Below you can find some of the most frequently asked questions. If you have any other questions about Wiuhu, feel free to send them to info@wiuhu.com and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WIUHU AND OTHER SLIDEBOARDS?</strong></p>
<p>Foot elements equipped with ball bearings give the user a better and steadier slide compared to traditional slideboards. The rail-like construction of Wiuhu allows a stable slide posture. Due to this design the kick is directed only sideways to help you learn to skate efficiently. It’s also possible to use Wiuhu with exercise band.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO ASSEMBLE WIUHU?</strong></p>
<p>Assembling Wiuhu is quick and easy. No extra tools (besides your hands) are needed and it’s possible to set Wiuhu up and running in less than a minute. Any sort of base is ok as long as it’s flat and hard. (Thorough technical details are sorted out when we decide eventual method for mass production.)</p>
<p><strong>IS IT SAFE TO USE WIUHU OUTDOORS?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED AGE FOR WIUHU?</strong></p>
<p>4 years and up</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS WIUHU MADE OF?</strong></p>
<p>The board and foot elements are made of durable plastic composite. The board base is rubber and therefore it’s very stable. The foot element bearings are made of metal. Construction materials are subject to change during product development process in case possible new better materials improve the quality of Wiuhu</p>
<p><strong>ARE THERE ANY WEIGHT LIMITS OR RESTRICTIONS?</strong></p>
<p>Preferred weight limit is 100 kg (220 lbs).</p>
<p><strong>HOW LIKELY ARE YOU ABLE TO STICK TO THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY SCHEDULE?</strong></p>
<p>Our partner Tackla has over 50 years of experience in product manufacturing and sales. We believe firmly that this know-how helps us to keep in schedule.</p>
<p><strong>IS WIUHU INTENDED ONLY FOR HOCKEY PLAYERS?</strong></p>
<p>Wiuhu Slideboard is suitable for anyone interested in exercising and improving their stamina, enhancing motor coordination and strengthening leg, core, and lower body muscles.</p>

<p>We are a team of three dudes from northern Finland where hockey is a way of life. Our background is in hockey – ex-players and junior coaches.</p>
<p>Especially junior hockey players don’t have much time on the ice and they still need to master their skating technique if they wish to reach a professional career. Today skaters and hockey players train their skating technique with different kinds of platforms with something to reduce the friction. This does not properly imitate how the slide with real skates and ice is like.</p>
<p>After years and years of battling with different methods of off-the-ice training – including sliding on smooth plywood with slippery socks – we decided to design a method of our own. After long thinking and testing we managed to find the solution which now is named Wiuhu Slideboard.</p>
<p>For research and development as well as for logistics and production, we have partnered with <a href=""http://www.tackla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tackla</a>. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495534198/pwodpfntdqs18ibeek8u.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Wiuhu is made from durable composite and can be adjusted to either 2 (6' 7"") or 3 meters (9' 10"") wide. Ball bearing equipped foot elements give you a steady and smooth slide every time.
 



Due to its design Wiuhu helps you achieve correct knee-nose alignment when training. Stable foot elements guarantee you slide only in the direction your training needs you to. Correct postitioning and the angle of your kick allow you to concentrate your training to the right muscle groups. This gives you more power and speed where it is needed – on the ice.
 



Even though we designed Wiuhu to help your skating technique, you can do a variety of different exercises with our slideboard. Grab your stick and drop the puck on some plywood and you have a nice setup for a hand-eye coordination training. An elastic band gives you extra resistance when you need it.
 


We are currently in prototype phase. The look and material of the final product may differ from the images shown but the quality and properties concerning the use of the product will remain the same.
 


 

Below you can find some of the most frequently asked questions. If you have any other questions about Wiuhu, feel free to send them to info@wiuhu.com and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.
WHAT ARE THE MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WIUHU AND OTHER SLIDEBOARDS?
Foot elements equipped with ball bearings give the user a better and steadier slide compared to traditional slideboards. The rail-like construction of Wiuhu allows a stable slide posture. Due to this design the kick is directed only sideways to help you learn to skate efficiently. It’s also possible to use Wiuhu with exercise band.
HOW TO ASSEMBLE WIUHU?
Assembling Wiuhu is quick and easy. No extra tools (besides your hands) are needed and it’s possible to set Wiuhu up and running in less than a minute. Any sort of base is ok as long as it’s flat and hard. (Thorough technical details are sorted out when we decide eventual method for mass production.)
IS IT SAFE TO USE WIUHU OUTDOORS?
Yes.
WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED AGE FOR WIUHU?
4 years and up
WHAT IS WIUHU MADE OF?
The board and foot elements are made of durable plastic composite. The board base is rubber and therefore it’s very stable. The foot element bearings are made of metal. Construction materials are subject to change during product development process in case possible new better materials improve the quality of Wiuhu
ARE THERE ANY WEIGHT LIMITS OR RESTRICTIONS?
Preferred weight limit is 100 kg (220 lbs).
HOW LIKELY ARE YOU ABLE TO STICK TO THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY SCHEDULE?
Our partner Tackla has over 50 years of experience in product manufacturing and sales. We believe firmly that this know-how helps us to keep in schedule.
IS WIUHU INTENDED ONLY FOR HOCKEY PLAYERS?
Wiuhu Slideboard is suitable for anyone interested in exercising and improving their stamina, enhancing motor coordination and strengthening leg, core, and lower body muscles.
 



We are a team of three dudes from northern Finland where hockey is a way of life. Our background is in hockey – ex-players and junior coaches.
Especially junior hockey players don’t have much time on the ice and they still need to master their skating technique if they wish to reach a professional career. Today skaters and hockey players train their skating technique with different kinds of platforms with something to reduce the friction. This does not properly imitate how the slide with real skates and ice is like.
After years and years of battling with different methods of off-the-ice training – including sliding on smooth plywood with slippery socks – we decided to design a method of our own. After long thinking and testing we managed to find the solution which now is named Wiuhu Slideboard.
For research and development as well as for logistics and production, we have partnered with Tackla.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

(Oxford English Dictionary)</p><p>The purpose of the foot is to provide a stable base of support to control the direction of the body weight during the stance phase of locomotion [1-3]. Newtonian physics dictates that a wider base of support is more stable than a narrow base. Width and stability of the forefoot is crucial in this regard as the highest forces during mid stance occur at the forefoot [4, 5]. A greater spread of the toes, the great toe in particular, reduces forefoot peak pressures, distributes force more evenly, and stabilises the foot and ankle [6-8]. Toes squashed together by years of wearing narrow shoes that do not respect the natural fan shape of the human foot [9] are common [10] and are linked to instability and movement-related pain [11, 12]. Natural function can be restored by regular loading of the feet in footwear that respect natural design of the foot [13] and permit freedom for the toes to spread and stabilise the foot.</p><p><strong>Pain-free movement begins with a stable base of support. A stable foot requires Toe freedom, only functional footwear provides toe freedom. Joe Nimble ‘functional footwear’ is based on this science. </strong></p><p>*References below</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580397591/owhckf0k4j66o5xveorj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580807283/h5gl0dap2ue4kuwfjpbs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580398006/qbcoqj2yrvoosrtbndzh.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p> </p><div style=""padding-right:15px;float: left;"">

 BIOMECHANIST, RUNNING COACH AND CREATOR​ OF THE FUNCTIONAL FOOTMAP.Lee is one of the most recognised coaches for running technique on an international level.  His knowledge and experience in running biomechanics and foot function has benefited injured runners, both recreational and elite around the globe and led him to develop the Functional FootMap assessment system.   

 

 

 
 
SHOE PIONEER AND INVENTOR OF THE FUNCTIONAL FOOTWEAR DESIGN CONCEPT
Sebastian´s family has been making shoes with toefreedom® for over three decades.  His experience of helping people all around the world to improve their foot function through the benefits of toefreedom® and his passion for running has led him to create the Functional Footwear Design Concept.
 __________________________________________________________________________________________ Michelin has been forging a better way forward for over 100 years. They have spanned millions of miles on the mission to develop groundbreaking multi-surface contact for vehicles operating in the most challenging environments all over the world. We decided to partner with Soles by Michelin because of their unrivalled expertise in rubber and tread design to equip our nimbleToes Addict with the perfect outsole for Functional Footwear in long distance running.   The inspiration for the nimbleToes AddictWhen crewing at the worlds toughest footrace, the Badwater Ultramarathon, a few years ago, Sebastian observed that a lot of the elite athletes cut open the front of their running shoe to have more freedom for their toes and reduce the risk of injury.  His unique know-how in making casual shoes with toefreedom® inspired him to introduce this design philosophy to the running shoe industry.  DR WILKINSONDr Wilkinson´s research area is the biology of human health and performance. His work has included the biomechanics and performance determinants of distance running and the link between plantar sensation and regulation of bipedal gait.  He has a particular interest in the influence of footwear on foot structure, function and joint loading during running. FUNCTIONnounan activity that is natural to or the purpose of a person or thing. (Oxford English Dictionary)The purpose of the foot is to provide a stable base of support to control the direction of the body weight during the stance phase of locomotion [1-3]. Newtonian physics dictates that a wider base of support is more stable than a narrow base. Width and stability of the forefoot is crucial in this regard as the highest forces during mid stance occur at the forefoot [4, 5]. A greater spread of the toes, the great toe in particular, reduces forefoot peak pressures, distributes force more evenly, and stabilises the foot and ankle [6-8]. Toes squashed together by years of wearing narrow shoes that do not respect the natural fan shape of the human foot [9] are common [10] and are linked to instability and movement-related pain [11, 12]. Natural function can be restored by regular loading of the feet in footwear that respect natural design of the foot [13] and permit freedom for the toes to spread and stabilise the foot.Pain-free movement begins with a stable base of support. A stable foot requires Toe freedom, only functional footwear provides toe freedom. Joe Nimble ‘functional footwear’ is based on this science. *References below  
If you’re new to Joe Nimble Functional Footwear you might be wondering what the right shoe size is you should buy. Well, the good news is: You just need to order your regular shoe size.
MEASURE YOUR FEETIf you are not sure about your right shoe size, here are some simple instructions for measuring your feet. You only need:

a sheet of paper
a pencil
a ruler or measuring tape


This is how it works: Stand on the paper with both feet while you are wearing socks. Simply trace around the outline of your feet with a pencil one after the other.
Important: Always hold the pencil upright on the paper, not leaning tot he inside or outside in order to get an accurate result.
Now simply measure the length of your drawing. Measure from the tip oft he longest toe tot he bottom (at the center) of your heel. If your feet are different sizes, then the bigger foot determines the correct shoe size.

Nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism occur when the eye lens and eye distance are “out of sync"". Normal distance vision is the result of the light entering the eye and focusing exactly on the retina, where the brain interprets sharp images. Common deviations from normal vision, nearsightedness, or myopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light before your retina; Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light past your retina, both causing the brain to interpret ""blurry"" images. Almost 50% of the human population has some degree of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. These conditions are also known as ""refractive errors"".</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568067905/wkehswyofykarmejntqo.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>EyeQue Insight Plus</strong></p><p>The Insight Vision Screener represent a complex work of art and technology.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is Hupnos?</h2>
<p>Hupnos is an intelligent sleep mask that <strong>analyzes</strong> your snoring habits and takes <strong>gentle steps to fix it.</strong> All you have to do is wear it and whenever the mask detects that you’re snoring, it will send gentle vibrations to the Hupnos Sleep Mask to cue you to change positions and open your airways.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542064876/fel7colciymr2ip649fu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How it Works</h2>
<p>Hupnos makes use of a treatment known as EPAP (Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure). We’ve spent many months designing hardware and software that can bring EPAP technology to a fully-functional luxury sleep mask.</p>
<p>The mask uses a built-in accelerometer to monitor your movement as you sleep, track your snoring patterns, and automatically apply the sleep treatment known as EPAP to eliminate your snoring.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/3DT8v8v.gif"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Our <strong>powerful</strong> smartphone application gives you real-time data on your snoring patterns based on multiple factors. It then communicates with the mask, which monitors your movement with a built-in accelerometer.</p>
<p>Based on the sleep data, the application will decide whether or not to send you a tiny vibrational cue to change positions or increase your expiration pressure, which opens your airways.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542064897/zsejqt4cba5uf4hntbhe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The overall design and system is the result of over fifty user-testing cycles of the Hupnos sleep mask. We have perfected the design. It’s different from anything else out there.</p>
<p>It will <strong><i>stop your snoring</i></strong> and leave you and your partner feeling refreshed, rested, and full of energy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;'>Has Snoring Hurt Your Relationship?</span></p>
<p>It’s the big elephant in the room. Persistent snoring leads to many <strong><i>restless nights</i></strong> and <strong><i>weary mornings</i></strong> for your partner.</p>
<p>At first, it seems harmless or is even a bit cute, but over time, it can affect your work, family, friends, and be a source of tension in your relationships.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541713238/wmytu8pozihnn0luvmzy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We’ve heard about many couples relationship stress caused by snoring.</p>
<p>Julie Bane was pestered by her husband for years about losing sleep over her snoring. Constantly having to shake her awake so he could sleep was exhausting for both of them. And the issue spilled into the day, too. “It <strong>made me irritable</strong> because I wasn't sleeping well, and I'd be crabby the next day,” she remembers.</p>
<p>Angela Durrant, 48, was so sleep-deprived because of partner David Bazley’s snoring that she <strong>struggled to concentrate at work.</strong></p>
<p><i>""I’ve often had to explain to my bosses why I’m not feeling my usual self. After being kept awake by David half the night, I struggle to focus because my head is so foggy.”</i></p>
<p>Full-Time mom Christina Koutoula, 31 was <strong>so exhausted</strong> due to her husband Dimitrios’s snoring that she moved into the spare room.</p>
<p><i>""Dimitrios and I have slept apart on and off for years but four months ago I moved into the spare bedroom permanently. I couldn’t take it a moment longer.”</i></p>
<p>This problem has an <strong>easy fix.</strong> It shouldn’t be causing you sleepless nights or affecting your relationship. If you’ve finally had enough and want to stop you or your partner’s snoring for good, then we’d love to tell you a bit about Hupnos.</p>
<p>Hupnos is different from every other solution out there when it comes to snoring. By now, you might have tried mouth guards, special pillows, nasal sprays, nostril dilators, and even herbal remedies.</p>
<p>We did too. They didn’t work. Some worked for a little while, but then you’ll go back to your old ways. Who knows, maybe your partner is even complaining about your consistent obstructive snoring.</p>
<p>It leads to sleepless nights, weary mornings, and a heck of a lot of stress.</p>
<p>What we’ve designed is completely different…</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Real-Time Snore Detection</h2>
<p>The FREE downloadable Hupnos app detects snoring and records it for you. You can easily see all the snoring through your night and track it so that you can figure out which factors hurt your sleep and which remedies help you to sleep perfectly.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541711710/yqhc03wogmjq4or2s4sh.png"" src=""""/><br/> <p>You’ll never have to worry about your snoring again. You and your partner can customize the app to your lifestyle, making it easy to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The factors that <strong><i>influence</i></strong> your sleep (caffeine, stress, alcohol)</li>
<li>Sleep remedies you are trying and their <strong><i>direct effect</i></strong>
</li>
<li>Your recorded sleeping patterns, including body position, snoring duration, and even the audio of your night!</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/q4K4kei.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This system combines the Hupnos sleep mask with a powerful smartphone app to give you real-time snore detection. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Sleep Position Optimization</h2>
<p>Our mask knows your position throughout the night. You’ll feel a gentle vibration via your mask if you are snoring while on your back. These gentle vibrations cue you to roll over without fully waking.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541774850/ggnllwowzlruaxil9wae.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Snoring is caused by many different factors. It can come from mouth construction, where overweight individuals experience a narrowing of their airways due to throat tissue or an elongated uvula.</p>
<p>It can be due to a block nasal channel, chronic congestion, or a deviated nasal septum. Additionally, a “clogged hose” can occur where some patients who have a long soft palate, or large tonsils or adenoids, can narrow the airway and cause snoring.</p>

<p>Our founder was receiving complaints of his snoring becoming bad. After trying everything he could buy he stepped back and looked at core technologies that were proven and efficacy was high.

<p>We immediately began user testing to improve the user experience following modern practices in Lean Design promoted by Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup.

<p>A second issue was the users did not know how much pressure they needed to use. So we designed an EPAP system controlled by a smartphone app. The app listens to a user and decides if he/she is snoring. The EPAP is off until the user snores. Pressure is applied by closing the expiratory valve until the snoring goes away. It is opened if the user is sensed to be awake. We determine if the user is awake by monitoring movement with an accelerometer built into the mask.</p>

</div></div>","Is there a snorer in your bedroom?
Hupnos detects, tracks, and eliminates snoring.
 


What is Hupnos?
Hupnos is an intelligent sleep mask that analyzes your snoring habits and takes gentle steps to fix it. All you have to do is wear it and whenever the mask detects that you’re snoring, it will send gentle vibrations to the Hupnos Sleep Mask to cue you to change positions and open your airways.



How it Works
Hupnos makes use of a treatment known as EPAP (Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure). We’ve spent many months designing hardware and software that can bring EPAP technology to a fully-functional luxury sleep mask.
The mask uses a built-in accelerometer to monitor your movement as you sleep, track your snoring patterns, and automatically apply the sleep treatment known as EPAP to eliminate your snoring.


Our powerful smartphone application gives you real-time data on your snoring patterns based on multiple factors. It then communicates with the mask, which monitors your movement with a built-in accelerometer.
Based on the sleep data, the application will decide whether or not to send you a tiny vibrational cue to change positions or increase your expiration pressure, which opens your airways.

The overall design and system is the result of over fifty user-testing cycles of the Hupnos sleep mask. We have perfected the design. It’s different from anything else out there.
It will stop your snoring and leave you and your partner feeling refreshed, rested, and full of energy.
Has Snoring Hurt Your Relationship?
It’s the big elephant in the room. Persistent snoring leads to many restless nights and weary mornings for your partner.
At first, it seems harmless or is even a bit cute, but over time, it can affect your work, family, friends, and be a source of tension in your relationships.

We’ve heard about many couples relationship stress caused by snoring.
Julie Bane was pestered by her husband for years about losing sleep over her snoring. Constantly having to shake her awake so he could sleep was exhausting for both of them. And the issue spilled into the day, too. “It made me irritable because I wasn't sleeping well, and I'd be crabby the next day,” she remembers.
Angela Durrant, 48, was so sleep-deprived because of partner David Bazley’s snoring that she struggled to concentrate at work.
""I’ve often had to explain to my bosses why I’m not feeling my usual self. After being kept awake by David half the night, I struggle to focus because my head is so foggy.”
Full-Time mom Christina Koutoula, 31 was so exhausted due to her husband Dimitrios’s snoring that she moved into the spare room.
""Dimitrios and I have slept apart on and off for years but four months ago I moved into the spare bedroom permanently. I couldn’t take it a moment longer.”
This problem has an easy fix. It shouldn’t be causing you sleepless nights or affecting your relationship. If you’ve finally had enough and want to stop you or your partner’s snoring for good, then we’d love to tell you a bit about Hupnos.
Hupnos is different from every other solution out there when it comes to snoring. By now, you might have tried mouth guards, special pillows, nasal sprays, nostril dilators, and even herbal remedies.
We did too. They didn’t work. Some worked for a little while, but then you’ll go back to your old ways. Who knows, maybe your partner is even complaining about your consistent obstructive snoring.
It leads to sleepless nights, weary mornings, and a heck of a lot of stress.
What we’ve designed is completely different…
Real-Time Snore Detection
The FREE downloadable Hupnos app detects snoring and records it for you. You can easily see all the snoring through your night and track it so that you can figure out which factors hurt your sleep and which remedies help you to sleep perfectly.
 You’ll never have to worry about your snoring again. You and your partner can customize the app to your lifestyle, making it easy to see:

The factors that influence your sleep (caffeine, stress, alcohol)
Sleep remedies you are trying and their direct effect

Your recorded sleeping patterns, including body position, snoring duration, and even the audio of your night!


This system combines the Hupnos sleep mask with a powerful smartphone app to give you real-time snore detection. 
Sleep Position Optimization
Our mask knows your position throughout the night. You’ll feel a gentle vibration via your mask if you are snoring while on your back. These gentle vibrations cue you to roll over without fully waking.

Snoring is caused by many different factors. It can come from mouth construction, where overweight individuals experience a narrowing of their airways due to throat tissue or an elongated uvula.
It can be due to a block nasal channel, chronic congestion, or a deviated nasal septum. Additionally, a “clogged hose” can occur where some patients who have a long soft palate, or large tonsils or adenoids, can narrow the airway and cause snoring.
Frequently, a poor sleeping position will force the closure of your upper airway, putting undue stress on your uvula. The Hupnos app analyzes when this occurs and then, through tiny vibrations, signals your body to change positions and then if snoring continues it activates the EPAP in the mask which increases the exhalation pressure so you stop snoring.
You don’t have to worry about any of this. It all does it automatically and you won’t even notice it while you’re sleeping.
Comfortable Fit
You’re getting a premium microfiber face mask with a easily adjustable rear head strap. We specifically designed Hupnos to be comfortable to wear and give you a luxurious sleeping experience.  The Hupnos mask is made with hypoallergenic, BPA-free, medical-grade material. It has a soft, gently, and form-fitted design. Based on the clinical study of 4,000 facial structures, Hupnos is guaranteed to fit your face perfectly.
Believe us, it’s so comfy, you won’t want to take it off!
Respiratory Airway Dilation
Our patent-pending mask will increase your exhilation pressure, which opens your airways, so you breathe quietly, WITHOUT SNORING.  Ever notice how you or your partner don’t snore when you’re awake?
It sounds silly to say, but it’s actually part of the core reason why we snore.
Snoring occurs because the muscles in the body relax during sleep, allowing your soft palate, tongue, and uvula to vibrate as air flows by them. When people are awake, these muscles are active, and the structures are much less likely to vibrate during breathing.
By dilating your airways, Hupnos ensures that your snoring is quickly remedied. Your air passages remain clear, leading to a restful night’s sleep for you and your loved one.
“Research has shown that chronic snoring has the potential to lead to changes in a person’s health including fatigue, headaches, irritability, and even depression. Simple, comfortable solutions to stop snoring can be the first step to enhancing your health,"" according to Dr. Leah Millheiser of Stanford University.
Travel-Ready and Easy to Clean
Take it with you wherever you sleep. The detachable face mask is machine-washable. The removable silicone nose piece can be cleaned with an alcohol wipe.  You can take Hupnos wherever you go, including:

On an airplane
At your hotel on a business trip
Vacations with your family
Or even in your office for a quick nap

It fits perfectly into any small suitcase, backpack, or even purse.

<p>No
matter who you are or where you live, you should be able to drink a glass of water
in your home, neighborhood or school without worrying that it will make you
sick. This isn’t a reality for more than a million Californians however according to California’s Human
Right to Water Bill, access to safe drinking water is a basic human right.</p>
<p>Approximately
<span>25 percent of California’s 9,846 schools do
not meet the state and federal mandate to provide free, fresh drinking water to
school children at mealtimes. We estimate that more than 500 California schools
do not provide <b>safe</b> drinking water
at all to their students because of recurring safe drinking water compliance
violations.<br/></span></p>

Assistance Corporation (RCAC) is partnering with Community Water Center (CWC) and Pueblo Unido
Community Development Corporation (PUCDC) in an innovative pilot program called
<b>Agua4all</b>. This program aims to
increase access to and consumption of clean drinking water in California,
starting with the communities of South Kern County and the Eastern Coachella
Valley. Through the Agua4All pilot program, RCAC is installing 120 water dispensers in schools and other public places throughout these two areas.  <i>(The water
bottle filling station pictured above is an EXAMPLE of the many water dispensers we are installing.)</i> These water dispensers will provide water treatment where necessary to filter out arsenic or
other contaminants so that residents will finally have access to potable water.
Reusable bottles will also be made available to optimize access. <p></p>
<p>The two
local community partners, CWC and PUCDC, are providing on-the-ground support
for the year-long pilot.</p>

<i>(Pictured above are students at the San Jose Community Learning Center where we recently installed two water dispensers and related infrastructure through the help of a crowdfunding campaign like this one.)</i><br/><p></p>

<i>(Pictured above is the water dispenser we recently installed at the La Familia School</i>  <i>in Eastern Coachella Valley.)</i><br/><br/><p>This is
an interim solution, but it’s needed urgently. Every day children in these
schools are exposed to harmful contaminants, like arsenic, that are found in
their current water. We can’t encourage them to drink water as a healthy
alternative to sodas or other sugary beverages because their water is unsafe.
How are we to teach children that drinking water is a healthy option if we
can’t provide safe drinking water in their schools and/or their homes? </p>
<p>Permanent
solutions, which include upgrading local community water systems and treating
harmful contaminants so that the water is at a safe level, are very costly to
implement and maintain. In the meantime, Agua4All provides an interim solution
that could positively affect more than a million Californians’ health as we
expand across the state. This replicable model that RCAC and partners have
developed in the Kern and Coachella pilot communities can be used to expand
access to safe drinking water to children and their families throughout
California. </p>
<p>With
your help we can achieve this. Your donation will allow us to exceed our goal of
installing 120 water dispensers in Kern and Coachella and expand our program during the
next year. </p>

<p></p>
<p>With
your assistance, Agua4All will address two significant public health concerns:
a lack of affordable <b>access to safe drinking water</b> and<b>
disproportionate consumption of soda and other sugary drinks.</b></p>
<p><b>Access to Safe Water:</b></p>
<p></p>Between the two pilot locations of South Kern
County and the Eastern Coachella Valley,
the water bottle filling stations will provide safe water access to as many as
150,000 residents. <br/>
<br/>
Currently, much of <span>the water in these
two communities is not safe for drinking, and may not be safe for washing or
cooking. Poor quality is a result of naturally occurring and human-caused
contaminants in the water, like arsenic, that can cause many health problems.<br/>
</span><p></p>
<p>According
to the World Health Organization, long-term arsenic consumption <span>can cause cancer and skin lesions.
Arsenic consumption also has been associated with developmental defects,
cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity and diabetes.</span></p>
<p><b>Offering
an Alternative to Soda and Other Sugary Drinks:</b></p>
<p>A lack of access to safe
drinking water makes it a lot more difficult for Californians to maintain
healthy lifestyles. Without safe water, the nearest and most affordable
beverage options are often sodas and other sugary drinks. </p>
<p>In California, 41
percent of children, 62 percent of adolescents and 24 percent of adults drink
at least one soda or other sugar-sweetened beverage every day. </p>
<p>The situation is at its
most dire in rural communities where residents lack access to safe drinking
water. In a recent California Health Interview survey, 73 percent of South Kern
and 58 percent of Eastern Coachella Valley children drank sugar-sweetened
beverages the day before the survey was administered, as compared to just 40
percent of children surveyed statewide. </p>
<p>Regardless of location,
adults who drink one or more sodas or other sugar-sweetened beverages every day
are 27 percent more likely to be overweight or obese. Agua4All offers
Californians safe drinking water as a healthy beverage alternative to help address
this health concern.</p>

The Jamie Oliver Food Foundation (USA) is a California-based 501c3 nonprofit organization that works to bring food education to schools and youth groups, businesses and communities. It does this by raising awareness to galvanize policy changes at a local and national level, offering hands-on training to instill food skills and knowledge, and founding relationships to enable us to scale nationally.

matter who you are or where you live, you should be able to drink a glass of water
in your home, neighborhood or school without worrying that it will make you
sick. This isn’t a reality for more than a million Californians however according to California’s Human
Right to Water Bill, access to safe drinking water is a basic human right.
Approximately
25 percent of California’s 9,846 schools do
not meet the state and federal mandate to provide free, fresh drinking water to
school children at mealtimes. We estimate that more than 500 California schools
do not provide safe drinking water
at all to their students because of recurring safe drinking water compliance
violations.

To address these issues, Rural Community
Assistance Corporation (RCAC) is partnering with Community Water Center (CWC) and Pueblo Unido
Community Development Corporation (PUCDC) in an innovative pilot program called
Agua4all. This program aims to
increase access to and consumption of clean drinking water in California,
starting with the communities of South Kern County and the Eastern Coachella
Valley. Through the Agua4All pilot program, RCAC is installing 120 water dispensers in schools and other public places throughout these two areas.  (The water
bottle filling station pictured above is an EXAMPLE of the many water dispensers we are installing.) These water dispensers will provide water treatment where necessary to filter out arsenic or
other contaminants so that residents will finally have access to potable water.
Reusable bottles will also be made available to optimize access. 
The two
local community partners, CWC and PUCDC, are providing on-the-ground support
for the year-long pilot.



(Pictured above are students at the San Jose Community Learning Center where we recently installed two water dispensers and related infrastructure through the help of a crowdfunding campaign like this one.)
Your donation to this campaign will help us to ensure that
California students and families have access to safe, affordable drinking water.



(Pictured above is the water dispenser we recently installed at the La Familia School  in Eastern Coachella Valley.)This is
an interim solution, but it’s needed urgently. Every day children in these
schools are exposed to harmful contaminants, like arsenic, that are found in
their current water. We can’t encourage them to drink water as a healthy
alternative to sodas or other sugary beverages because their water is unsafe.
How are we to teach children that drinking water is a healthy option if we
can’t provide safe drinking water in their schools and/or their homes? 
Permanent
solutions, which include upgrading local community water systems and treating
harmful contaminants so that the water is at a safe level, are very costly to
implement and maintain. In the meantime, Agua4All provides an interim solution
that could positively affect more than a million Californians’ health as we
expand across the state. This replicable model that RCAC and partners have
developed in the Kern and Coachella pilot communities can be used to expand
access to safe drinking water to children and their families throughout
California. 
With
your help we can achieve this. Your donation will allow us to exceed our goal of
installing 120 water dispensers in Kern and Coachella and expand our program during the
next year. 
 




With
your assistance, Agua4All will address two significant public health concerns:
a lack of affordable access to safe drinking water and
disproportionate consumption of soda and other sugary drinks.
Access to Safe Water:
Between the two pilot locations of South Kern
County and the Eastern Coachella Valley,
the water bottle filling stations will provide safe water access to as many as
150,000 residents. 

Currently, much of the water in these
two communities is not safe for drinking, and may not be safe for washing or
cooking. Poor quality is a result of naturally occurring and human-caused
contaminants in the water, like arsenic, that can cause many health problems.

According
to the World Health Organization, long-term arsenic consumption can cause cancer and skin lesions.
Arsenic consumption also has been associated with developmental defects,
cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity and diabetes.
Offering
an Alternative to Soda and Other Sugary Drinks:
A lack of access to safe
drinking water makes it a lot more difficult for Californians to maintain
healthy lifestyles. Without safe water, the nearest and most affordable
beverage options are often sodas and other sugary drinks. 
In California, 41
percent of children, 62 percent of adolescents and 24 percent of adults drink
at least one soda or other sugar-sweetened beverage every day. 
The situation is at its
most dire in rural communities where residents lack access to safe drinking
water. In a recent California Health Interview survey, 73 percent of South Kern
and 58 percent of Eastern Coachella Valley children drank sugar-sweetened
beverages the day before the survey was administered, as compared to just 40
percent of children surveyed statewide. 
Regardless of location,
adults who drink one or more sodas or other sugar-sweetened beverages every day
are 27 percent more likely to be overweight or obese. Agua4All offers
Californians safe drinking water as a healthy beverage alternative to help address
this health concern.





The
$50,000 we seek will go toward installing 10 brand new water bottle
filling stations in the communities of South Kern County and Eastern
Coachella Valley. In addition to the stations themselves, your donations can provide
residents with the following:

$20 could provide
3 re-usable water bottles for school children
$50 can help
to educate 20 students on the benefits of choosing
fresh water over soda or other sugary drinks
$250 could cover
the cost of one certified point-of-use
arsenic filter

$500 could
pay for the installation costs of one water bottle filling
station



Your generous donations will also be used for
operation and maintenance costs, water treatment costs, program coordination
and administration, and program communications and outreach.
First Giving deducts a 4
percent fee to process payments and send donation
confirmations.
Indiegogo deducts a 3
percent fee to host the campaign if we reach our campaign
goal. If not, Indiegogo deducts 6.75 percent.

You get the gift of providing easy access to safe water to people in rural California communities AND you can choose perk or no perk. It's up to you!

<h3>Greetings!</h3>
<p>Thank you for checking out my project.  My name is Ahuva Gamliel.  I am a naturopathic doctor and licensed acupuncturist*.  My mission with this project is to help people on their journey of healing their mind-body-spirit.  Since the mind effects the body and the spirit, the goal of my meditations is to promote optimal wellbeing and cultivate inner peace.  Numerous health conditions today are stress-related, so if we can reduce stress, we can reduce illness!</p>
<p>My project involves creating meditation CDs for healing, stress reduction, relaxation and optimal wellbeing.  The meditations consist of positive affirmations, visualization as well as relaxation techniques. Besides the 5 samples for the CDs I am pre-selling here, I am also working on producing others which utilize Eastern medicine, Kabbalah, Psalms, Chakras, affirmations, and other spiritual practices for birthing, addictions, prosperity, healing, relationships, and many other topics.  <strong>These meditations are written so that people of all religious backgrounds can enjoy them.  They are universal and transcendent</strong>.</p>
<p>Each CD or MP3 will contain an audible guided-meditation with affirmations as well as background binaural beats.  The binaural beats contain various sound frequencies for training the brain subconsciously on the topic of the corresponding meditation.  The binaural beats consist of specially programmed nature sounds, soft music or other relaxing sounds.  In binaural recordings, different frequencies are sent to the left and right ears so for best results <strong>it is recommended to wear stereo earphones</strong>.   </p>
<p><strong>By working on both the conscious mind as well as the subconscious mind simultaneously, we can achieve the best results.</strong></p>
<p>*For more information about me and my healing and wellness practice, please visit <a href=""http://www.mibaso.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mibaso.org</a> or click here to my <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/MibasoHolisticHealth/videos?view=0&amp;sort=p&amp;flow=grid"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">youtube channel</a> where you can watch interviews of me on the news etc.  To check out my latest meditations please visit <a href=""http://www.MeditationsForSuccess.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.MeditationsForSuccess.com</a></p>

<p>Each CD costs approximately $1,200 to produce.  This includes professional graphics design, sound technician, custom background music, production, and marketing (CD Baby, Amazon, etc).  <em>So far we already have 11 scripts ready for production and need to raise $13,200 in order to fund all those projects</em>.  We have additional titles for meditations which have not been written yet so any surplus funding will go to producing additional new projects.  If our goal of the initial 11 meditation CDs/MP3s is not met, we will use the funding to produce however many meditations that it will cover.</p>
<p>The following MP3 downloads are available for purchase via this pre-sale offer:</p>

<p>THANK YOU so much for sponsoring and participating in our campaign.</p></div>","Greetings!
Thank you for checking out my project.  My name is Ahuva Gamliel.  I am a naturopathic doctor and licensed acupuncturist*.  My mission with this project is to help people on their journey of healing their mind-body-spirit.  Since the mind effects the body and the spirit, the goal of my meditations is to promote optimal wellbeing and cultivate inner peace.  Numerous health conditions today are stress-related, so if we can reduce stress, we can reduce illness!
My project involves creating meditation CDs for healing, stress reduction, relaxation and optimal wellbeing.  The meditations consist of positive affirmations, visualization as well as relaxation techniques. Besides the 5 samples for the CDs I am pre-selling here, I am also working on producing others which utilize Eastern medicine, Kabbalah, Psalms, Chakras, affirmations, and other spiritual practices for birthing, addictions, prosperity, healing, relationships, and many other topics.  These meditations are written so that people of all religious backgrounds can enjoy them.  They are universal and transcendent.
Each CD or MP3 will contain an audible guided-meditation with affirmations as well as background binaural beats.  The binaural beats contain various sound frequencies for training the brain subconsciously on the topic of the corresponding meditation.  The binaural beats consist of specially programmed nature sounds, soft music or other relaxing sounds.  In binaural recordings, different frequencies are sent to the left and right ears so for best results it is recommended to wear stereo earphones.   
By working on both the conscious mind as well as the subconscious mind simultaneously, we can achieve the best results.
*For more information about me and my healing and wellness practice, please visit www.mibaso.org or click here to my youtube channel where you can watch interviews of me on the news etc.  To check out my latest meditations please visit www.MeditationsForSuccess.com
 What We Need & What You Get

Each CD costs approximately $1,200 to produce.  This includes professional graphics design, sound technician, custom background music, production, and marketing (CD Baby, Amazon, etc).  So far we already have 11 scripts ready for production and need to raise $13,200 in order to fund all those projects.  We have additional titles for meditations which have not been written yet so any surplus funding will go to producing additional new projects.  If our goal of the initial 11 meditation CDs/MP3s is not met, we will use the funding to produce however many meditations that it will cover.
The following MP3 downloads are available for purchase via this pre-sale offer:

<p>Mucuna (<b><i>Mucuna pruriens</i>, Mucuna L. Fabaceae)</b>  has been used in Ayurvedic (the traditional Hindu system of medicine, translates as ""life knowledge"") medicine since 300 BC for the treatment of “kamptvata,”similar in diagnosis to Parkinson’s disease.<br/></p>
<p>Also known as “Kapikachu,” “Atmagupta,” “Velvet Bean,” “Cowitch” and “Poona Kachi.” Mucuna is legume indigenous to
tropical regions such as India, Hawaii, West Africa, and Central America. Mucuna
is a vigorous annual (sometimes biannual), twining herb, stems extending up to
18m in length, with large trifoliate leaves.  Mucuna produces inflorescences in axillary racemes, up to 32 cm long with many flowers in
shades of purple or white. Pods are oblong 4-13 cm long, with light brown
hairs. Mucuna is self-pollinating. Interest exists in developing Mucuna species
as a sustainable, edible cover crop. </p>

<p>Parkinson’s is a degenerative disease affecting the nervous system. The underlying
cause is unknown; as of now, there is <b>no known cure</b>. </p>
<p><b>                                             PARKINSON’S STATISTICS</b></p>
<p>According to the Parkinson’s Disease
Foundation, an estimated ~<b>10 million
people</b> world wide are living with Parkinson’s disease, and this number does
not reflect the thousands of cases that go undetected. As many as 1 million
Americans are affected by Parkinson’s disease, which is more than the combined
number of people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and Lou
Gehrig’s disease. Men are 1.5 times more likely to have Parkinson’s than women.</p>
<p><b>                                   WHAT DOES PARKINSON’S COST ?</b></p>
<p>It is estimated to cost ~<b>$25 billion</b> per year in the United
States alone (this figure represents the combined direct and indirect cost,
including treatment, social security payments and lost income from inability to
work). </p>
<p>An average Parkinson’s patient will
spend ~$2,500 a year, and therapeutic surgery can cost up to ~$100,000 dollars
per patient. </p>
<p><b>                                                 ALARMING STATISTICS</b></p>
<p>According to
the Journal of Neurology the number of worldwide cases of Parkinson’s disease
is predicted to double in the next 25 years. The number of individuals with <b>Parkinson’s disease in 15 of the world’s
largest nations will double over the next generation</b>. </p>
<p>Infectious diseases attract the greatest attention from research
funding, however, it is non-communicable chronic diseases, such as Parkinson's, that
represent a far greater burden in terms of economic and social cost to
developing nations.</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">                         PARKINSON’S PATHWAY

<p><b>Dopamine</b> cannot cross the blood brain barrier (a selective semi-permeable
membrane that protects the brain, it only allows selective chemicals to pass
through), so in <b>Parkinson’s treatment the patient is given levodopa (L-DOPA)</b>,
which is the <b>precursor compound to dopamine. </b></p>
<p>According to
the <u>Journal of Asia Pacific Clinical Nutrition</u>, pharmacological
treatment of Parkinson’s disease with synthetic L-DOPA/carbidopa is the most
practical and effective physiological way, to-date, to ameliorate the underlying
deficiency of endogenous dopamine release in the striatum. However, the
pharmacokinetic properties of orally administered synthetic L-DOPA lead to
fluctuating blood levels, generating ‘on-off’ fluctuations of motor performance
in patients. Side-effects of this treatment are common (nausea, vomiting, constipation),
and unfortunately long-term treatment can result in hallucinations.</p>
<p><b>                                         WHAT MUCUNA CAN OFFER</b></p>
<p>In clinical
studies published in the <u>Journal of Phytotherapy Research</u>, Mucuna seed
powder, which contains L-DOPA, has been shown to alleviate Parkinson’s
dyskinesia (involuntary movement) more effectively, while suppressing symptoms
longer than synthetic L-DOPA without producing ‘on-off’ fluctuations of motor
performance.  Studies suggest that Mucuna
may contain unidentified synergistic compounds that affect the pharmacokinetics
of the seed’s L-DOPA in a way that enhances L-DOPA’s anti-Parkinson’s activity.</p>

<p><u>The
Journal of Phytotherapy Research</u> published a study stating that the active components in Mucuna
have neuroprotective impacts on the substantia nigra and nigrastriatel
pathways, and the high-fiber content of Mucuna also makes it a laxative that
helps digestion and reduces constipation frequently problematic in Parkinson’s
patients. Thus, the <b>plant’s biological properties and naturally occurring
compounds may offer safer, and improved, treatment alternatives for Parkinson’s
disease.</b></p>

<p><b>Plants are essential sources of medicine</b>, they offer a diverse reservoir of
biologically active components. To date, <b>Mucuna has more L-DOPA than any other
known plant in the world.</b></p>
<p>Mucuna
protects from damaging chemical conversions that occur naturally as the body
ages. <b>Mucuna has shown to be neuroprotective</b>  (it functions as an <b>antioxidant and protects the brain from
oxidative damage</b>). Mucuna provides symptomatic relief; moreover, animal studies
have indicated a neurorestorative effect in the dopamine neurons of the
substantia nigra.  In Parkinson’s,
the substantia nigra (the area of the brain containing cells that manufacture
dopamine) are damaged or dying, and the brain loses the ability to manufacture
these chemicals. Research on Mucuna may hold promising results for the
treatment, prevention and even neurorestoration of brain areas affected by
Parkinson’s disease.<a href=""http://imgur.com/lFsiYAu"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/lFsiYAu.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""source: imgur.com""/></a></p>

<p>The proposed field research will document ethnobotanical knowledge of the plant Mucuna cultivated by the Irula and Paniya tribes of the Niligri Hills, located in southwestern India.I will then conduct laboratory analysis to determine respective L-DOPA concentrations.</p>
<p><b>                                         </b><b>   THE MUCUNA HYPOTHESIS</b></p>
<p><b>I hypothesize that the two geographically distinct ecosystems of the Irula and Paniyas tribes will cultivate Mucuna seeds of containing varying L-DOPA concentrations. </b>Under the supervision of Nilgiri Hills ethnobotanist Dr. Dhanabal (whom is the current principal at JSS College of Pharmacy).</p>
<p>I propose to document and compare the two ecosystems in which these tribes live, while also evaluating any differences in traditional cultivation and harvest practices of the Mucuna plant. I then propose to collect seed samples from the Mucuna plants cultivated and harvested by the two tribes. I will then conduct laboratory analysis to determine respective L-DOPA concentrations. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Laboratory analysis will include High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC).</span></p>

Hi, I’m Tanya! I am conducting
research on the plant Mucuna pruriens,
and its potential to treat Parkinson’s disease.



When my grandmother died from the ravages of Alzheimer’s disease
12 years ago, I was devastated. For 6 years she declined, losing her ability to communicate and interact with the world around her, she no
longer recognized me, I was a frightening stranger to my once
capable and compassionate grandmother. It was during those somber times that I
made a sincere commitment to study medicine. From these heartbreaking early experiences, neuroscience
became my passion.



Over the past 5 years I have been researching
Parkinson’s and the plant Mucuna. My proposed research project will aid in my preparation for Naturopathic Medical School Fall 2016. 






My campaign is
to raise $30,000 to fund 3 months of
research to study the plant Mucuna at a College of Pharmacy in Southwestern India. This research is in conjunction with Amala Soumyanath Ph.D at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU).
I am crowd funding because federal funds have faced huge budget cuts for science and research, the biggest hurdle for my research
project is funding. Unfortunately, traditional medicine falls outside
the realm of imminent grant funding. However, I am not letting this stop my
passionate pursuit of Mucuna. Now, I am looking to crowd funding and my
community of complementary health advocates to help support my research. 
I plan to study Mucuna in its native
environment. I will be working with tribes and JSS College of Pharmacy to
collect and document ethnobotanical knowledge, and  lab analysis of the plant Mucuna for
Parkinson’s research.


I graduated from the University of
Portland (B.S., and minor in psychology) my emphasis was in neuroscience. Shortly after, I began volunteering at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) studying Mucuna
& Parkinson’s disease.
 


My
passion for neuroscience grew into an appreciation for natural medicine, and
how it can protect and restore brain chemistry.



I became
interested in naturopathic neurology, preventive medicine and traditional plant
medicine or “ethnobotany” (how people historically used plants to treat
illness).
With all the wonderful advances of western medicine, we seem to have
forgotten or bypassed the wisdom of traditional medicine and the possible cures plants possess.



My passion for neuroscience and
natural medicine has led me to Mucuna, and I am excited to see how this plant
will continue to inspire me and benefit Parkinson’s disease. I am also thrilled
to expand Mucuna’s repertoire to other diseases and neurological imbalances,
research has shown Mucuna has the potential to treat a myriad of illnesses (epilepsy, depression, ADHD, infertility, high
cholesterol, high blood sugar, anxiety, drug additions, parasites and is very useful for bodybuilders). 


 






Mucuna (Mucuna pruriens, Mucuna L. Fabaceae)  has been used in Ayurvedic (the traditional Hindu system of medicine, translates as ""life knowledge"") medicine since 300 BC for the treatment of “kamptvata,”similar in diagnosis to Parkinson’s disease.
Also known as “Kapikachu,” “Atmagupta,” “Velvet Bean,” “Cowitch” and “Poona Kachi.” Mucuna is legume indigenous to
tropical regions such as India, Hawaii, West Africa, and Central America. Mucuna
is a vigorous annual (sometimes biannual), twining herb, stems extending up to
18m in length, with large trifoliate leaves.  Mucuna produces inflorescences in axillary racemes, up to 32 cm long with many flowers in
shades of purple or white. Pods are oblong 4-13 cm long, with light brown
hairs. Mucuna is self-pollinating. Interest exists in developing Mucuna species
as a sustainable, edible cover crop. 
  

Mucuna
seeds are high in the amino acid: levodopa 7% (L-DOPA) which is the precursor
compound to the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine is deficient in Parkinson’s
disease. 







Mucuna is used occasionally as a minor
crop for human consumption. In Mexico and Honduras the seeds are roasted as
beans and used as a coffee substitute “Nescafe.” The beans can also be cooked
and the young leaves can get eaten as vegetables high in minerals K, Mg, Ca,
Fe, and lysine. 

    

                                            Pottery & Prints for Parkinson’s
Pottery for Parkinson’s - I’ve teamed up with John Denne (my papa) who has been honing the art of traditional southwestern Anazai & Prehistoric Pueblo handcoiled pottery for over 45 years. 
Prints for Parkinson’s – Whit Deschner (see video clip) has been living with Parkinson's for over 14 years. He is an amazing digital artist & published writer. He has travelled the world kayaking, exploring and taking pictures of his adventures. Whit has raised over $60,000 for Parkinson's research for OHSU (Oregon Health and Science University).

Departure: End of November (team of 3: Principal Investigator, Videographer, and Anthropologist).
The budget includes: airfare, train and bus fare to/from/in India for 3 people, room and board (on campus) for 3 months.
Lab/Equipment Costs: Lab Analysis (High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)), overhead costs at J.S.S. College of Pharmacy, (phytopharmacy lab electricity, chemical supplies) computer equipment. 
Field Costs: field interperator, soil analysis and field equipment, video equipment, field travel costs to tribal communities from Ooty. 


 
Clearly, plants and other natural products offer excellent sources of health-promoting medicines. Thus, it is extremely important that we enhance our capacity to further examine these traditional modalities and achieve a solid scientific understanding of their potential health benefits.
 
My proposed research is of conservational and medical significance. Indian tribal medicinal knowledge is being lost at an increasing rate due to the deforestation of tribal land for tea plantations.  Documenting the ecosystem and ethnobotanical factors that alter Mucuna will work to conserve traditional knowledge of the Irula and Paniya tribes and insure indigenous plant conservation. Conservation and scientific investigation of medical wisdom traditions is key to finding new modalities for healing.  
With your help we can archive the ethnobotany of Mucuna to facilitate future Parkinson’s research. 


 

Parkinson’s is a degenerative disease affecting the nervous system. The underlying
cause is unknown; as of now, there is no known cure. 
                                             PARKINSON’S STATISTICS
According to the Parkinson’s Disease
Foundation, an estimated ~10 million
people world wide are living with Parkinson’s disease, and this number does
not reflect the thousands of cases that go undetected. As many as 1 million
Americans are affected by Parkinson’s disease, which is more than the combined
number of people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and Lou
Gehrig’s disease. Men are 1.5 times more likely to have Parkinson’s than women.
                                   WHAT DOES PARKINSON’S COST ?
It is estimated to cost ~$25 billion per year in the United
States alone (this figure represents the combined direct and indirect cost,
including treatment, social security payments and lost income from inability to
work). 
An average Parkinson’s patient will
spend ~$2,500 a year, and therapeutic surgery can cost up to ~$100,000 dollars
per patient. 
                                                 ALARMING STATISTICS
According to
the Journal of Neurology the number of worldwide cases of Parkinson’s disease
is predicted to double in the next 25 years. The number of individuals with Parkinson’s disease in 15 of the world’s
largest nations will double over the next generation. 
Infectious diseases attract the greatest attention from research
funding, however, it is non-communicable chronic diseases, such as Parkinson's, that
represent a far greater burden in terms of economic and social cost to
developing nations.
                         PARKINSON’S PATHWAY
& CURRENT TREATMENT


Dopamine cannot cross the blood brain barrier (a selective semi-permeable
membrane that protects the brain, it only allows selective chemicals to pass
through), so in Parkinson’s treatment the patient is given levodopa (L-DOPA),
which is the precursor compound to dopamine. 
According to
the Journal of Asia Pacific Clinical Nutrition, pharmacological
treatment of Parkinson’s disease with synthetic L-DOPA/carbidopa is the most
practical and effective physiological way, to-date, to ameliorate the underlying
deficiency of endogenous dopamine release in the striatum. However, the
pharmacokinetic properties of orally administered synthetic L-DOPA lead to
fluctuating blood levels, generating ‘on-off’ fluctuations of motor performance
in patients. Side-effects of this treatment are common (nausea, vomiting, constipation),
and unfortunately long-term treatment can result in hallucinations.
                                         WHAT MUCUNA CAN OFFER
In clinical
studies published in the Journal of Phytotherapy Research, Mucuna seed
powder, which contains L-DOPA, has been shown to alleviate Parkinson’s
dyskinesia (involuntary movement) more effectively, while suppressing symptoms
longer than synthetic L-DOPA without producing ‘on-off’ fluctuations of motor
performance.  Studies suggest that Mucuna
may contain unidentified synergistic compounds that affect the pharmacokinetics
of the seed’s L-DOPA in a way that enhances L-DOPA’s anti-Parkinson’s activity.

The
Journal of Phytotherapy Research published a study stating that the active components in Mucuna
have neuroprotective impacts on the substantia nigra and nigrastriatel
pathways, and the high-fiber content of Mucuna also makes it a laxative that
helps digestion and reduces constipation frequently problematic in Parkinson’s
patients. Thus, the plant’s biological properties and naturally occurring
compounds may offer safer, and improved, treatment alternatives for Parkinson’s
disease.
                              


What
key concepts are we missing, or what compounds haven’t yet been identified in Mucuna as
useful for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease? It is my hope that my research
will help to shed light on these key questions.



Plants are essential sources of medicine, they offer a diverse reservoir of
biologically active components. To date, Mucuna has more L-DOPA than any other
known plant in the world.
Mucuna
protects from damaging chemical conversions that occur naturally as the body
ages. Mucuna has shown to be neuroprotective  (it functions as an antioxidant and protects the brain from
oxidative damage). Mucuna provides symptomatic relief; moreover, animal studies
have indicated a neurorestorative effect in the dopamine neurons of the
substantia nigra.  In Parkinson’s,
the substantia nigra (the area of the brain containing cells that manufacture
dopamine) are damaged or dying, and the brain loses the ability to manufacture
these chemicals. Research on Mucuna may hold promising results for the
treatment, prevention and even neurorestoration of brain areas affected by
Parkinson’s disease.
                                                   MUCUNA SUPPORTS:
Nervous system- supports mental alertness and enhances
nervous system function
Adaptogenic – increases resistance to stress
(anxiety relief, eliminating addictive drug cravings, restful sleep, calming
the nerves and uplifting the mood)
Adrenal tonic – strengthens/nourishes adrenal
glands (works on the kidney adrenal meridian) 
Antibacterial- suppresses/combats growth of bacteria
Antiviral- inhibits viral replication
Antiparasitic – ability to destroy/expel parasitic
worms
Immune tonic – nourishes/strengthens the immune system

Reproductive tonic (both male &
female)-
strengthens/nourishes reproductive system
Aphrodisiac- increases libido and potency
Anti-convulsion- used to treat epilepsy
Antidepressant – works on dopamine pathways to restore
balance
 




Traditionally
Mucuna has been used in India as an anti-venom
for snakes and scorpions, depression, epilepsy and to increase fertility and is used as an aphrodisiac.
Today Mucuna
is used as a supplement for bodybuilders,
it can increase the production of Human Growth Hormone (HGH). An increase in
HGH levels can increase the body’s ability to build lean muscle and break down
fat.

To control high cholesterol, it is abundant in the amino acid levodopa which has shown to lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels.  
Mucuna is
used to treat Infertility, increase libido, erectile dysfunction and acts
as an aphrodisiac. Mucuna can
increase testosterone levels, and increases tissue resiliency.


                                                         OBJECTIVES
This project will (1) document ethnobotanical knowledge and practices regarding Mucuna cultivation and harvest; (2) investigate the chemical properties of seeds grown under different practices and ecosystems and their relation to medical use for Parkinson’s disease; and (3) preserve the medical wisdom tradition of the Irula and Paniya tribes to encourage the protection of the plant’s native habitat.




  

                                                  PROJECT ABSTRACT
The proposed field research will document ethnobotanical knowledge of the plant Mucuna cultivated by the Irula and Paniya tribes of the Niligri Hills, located in southwestern India.I will then conduct laboratory analysis to determine respective L-DOPA concentrations.
                                            THE MUCUNA HYPOTHESIS
I hypothesize that the two geographically distinct ecosystems of the Irula and Paniyas tribes will cultivate Mucuna seeds of containing varying L-DOPA concentrations. Under the supervision of Nilgiri Hills ethnobotanist Dr. Dhanabal (whom is the current principal at JSS College of Pharmacy).
I propose to document and compare the two ecosystems in which these tribes live, while also evaluating any differences in traditional cultivation and harvest practices of the Mucuna plant. I then propose to collect seed samples from the Mucuna plants cultivated and harvested by the two tribes. I will then conduct laboratory analysis to determine respective L-DOPA concentrations. Laboratory analysis will include High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC).


My goal is to better
understand the factors that alter Mucuna seed chemistry, this project is
intended to research ‘ideal growing’ conditions for the most potent Mucuna crop
for Parkinson’s treatment.
                                                                                                                                         
                                                         METHODS





                                                  LAB PROCEDURES 




Document historical
tribal knowledge that is being lost due to deforestation for tea plantations.  
Bring Mucuna
into the Parkinson’s research limelight, to encourage future clinical research
studies. 
I intend
to publish my research findings in conjunction with Oregon Health & Science
University (OHSU). I plan to give informational lectures in grade/high schools upon return.
 Research
will produce an ethnobotanical Parkinson’s documentary:  an ethnobotanical analysis of Mucuna pruriens, documenting tribal tradition for the treatment of
Parkinson’s disease’.
This research
opportunity will aid in my preparation for Naturopathic Medical School, where I
will continue to research Parkinson’s disease, Mucuna and other neurological
diseases. 







Scientific research and documentation of traditional knowledge
is essential to ensure meaningful interrelationship between science and
traditional knowledge. Ethnobotanical
analysis of Mucuna will protect the valuable species and bring attention to its
implications as a natural source of L-DOPA for the treatment of Parkinson’s
disease. 

 
Together we
can bring awareness and hope to Parkinson’s disease, and work toward new avenues for treatment, prevention and
neurological restoration.
I want to
increase cultural sensitivity and awareness for the advancement of global
medicine. I believe that the medical future is optimistic, and if we can
implement preventative medicine sooner we will be able to halt many diseases before
they manifest.  
I believe it
is important, to scientifically study and carry on the wisdom of traditional
medicine. Understanding historical plant
knowledge is essential to finding modern cures.",49.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A while back, I was on a date with an amazing woman, and in my effort of wooing her, I offered to cook dinner at my place. Seriously what guy wouldn't? She had indicated some food preferences, including making sure whatever I made was ""gluten free"" due to a longstanding sensitivity she had, and from there, I just let my creativity flow. At the store, while picking up some items I made sure I read every ingredient and product label, and I even double checked with the grocery store clerk on some items. Well, needless to say, dinner was great, the mood was perfect, and the conversation was even better (yep, we're still dating)...and then about an hour after finishing dinner, she started itching her hands substantially and her arms developed a slight rash thereafter, and that was just the start of it. It was </span>blatantly<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span>noticeable<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to the both of us...she was having an allergic reaction to something. She later shared with me that she ""felt </span>embarrassed""<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> (even though she had absolutely no reason to be) and I was thinking to myself ""oh my god, I just poisoned this beautiful woman."" Well, come to find out, after going back over every thing I bought and researching a little more online, guess what I found? Apparently, I bought a well-known product that even though it was labeled as ""gluten free,"" it had been a recalled product dated just a week prior for ""containing gluten,"" as you might have guessed. I was still somehow able to buy it and feed it to some one else that had an adverse reaction, which I could do nothing about at the time. NOT OK!</span></span></p>

We've developed some of the most cost-effective solutions for some of the most well known brands in the Food, Beverage and Dietary Supplement industries and we're only getting started. We've designed our operations with efficient and scalable technologies, incorporating Best Compliance Practices©, and leveraging the extensive scientific and regulatory expertise of our team to help reduce clients' overall legal and regulatory risks when it comes to developing, manufacturing and marketing Foods, Beverage and Dietary Supplements.

<p>Food and Dietary Supplement product recalls and other safety warnings are rampant in the news at present, often resulting from issues like undeclared allergens like my own personal story above or unexpected microbial contaminations, which are entirely too common. The lawsuits following such events are also sky rocketing and don't really benefit most consumers as a whole. These types of events can also include deliberate adulteration with ingredients not allowed in food products, such as certain drugs or other controlled substances not to mention counterfeit products! Unfortunately, not all companies in these industries have good business ethics or comply with the FDA's GMP regulations all the time whether based in the United States or abroad, and the FDA can only regulate so much given its limited resources. Moreover, numerous companies do not have sufficient product recall procedures (if any) or no experience in actually conducting a product recall even though this is a federal requirement, which leaves consumers at high risk of getting hurt. If you have ever consumed a food product and were sickened due to E. Coli contamination, Salmonella contamination, or perhaps an undeclared allergen such as Gluten, Shellfish or Peanut, or some drug active ingredient, this is situation we are tackling head on! This is what I'm talking about and why we are here asking for your support today, to help build out this technology as a service and take consumer food safety to the next level!</p>
<p><b>The Reality.</b><br/></p>
<p>Adverse Event Reporting (AER) and Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAER) to the FDA are requirements by law, but still go largely unenforced due to the sheer number of companies and products out in the marketplace. Even for those companies touting consumer health and safety as paramount, all too often they conduct business with that being much less of a priority. By the time a warning notice or product recall hits the press that you ""might"" read about, whether announced by the company itself or directly by the FDA, it is too late for dozens if not hundreds or more consumers already sickened or worse. Trust me, I know! We handle these matters all the time for our clients. The consumers though, the people like you and me, won't get the message or even really ever know what happened, and have little recourse not to mention possible unexpected medical bills. We can absolutely change this in 2016 and beyond!</p>

More importantly, for products that have been contaminated or recalled, which are either still on store shelves or have already been purchased, instant push-message notifications from the app (by respective brand holder) about the urgent matter or other critical recommendations to that specific consumer who purchased their product, exudes increased corporate social responsibility. It is not only a competitive advantage in general, but a tool to help mitigate non-compliance events, which can have tremendous legal and regulatory cost advantages down the road.

</div></div>","Poisoning My Love - The Backstory. 
A while back, I was on a date with an amazing woman, and in my effort of wooing her, I offered to cook dinner at my place. Seriously what guy wouldn't? She had indicated some food preferences, including making sure whatever I made was ""gluten free"" due to a longstanding sensitivity she had, and from there, I just let my creativity flow. At the store, while picking up some items I made sure I read every ingredient and product label, and I even double checked with the grocery store clerk on some items. Well, needless to say, dinner was great, the mood was perfect, and the conversation was even better (yep, we're still dating)...and then about an hour after finishing dinner, she started itching her hands substantially and her arms developed a slight rash thereafter, and that was just the start of it. It was blatantly noticeable to the both of us...she was having an allergic reaction to something. She later shared with me that she ""felt embarrassed"" (even though she had absolutely no reason to be) and I was thinking to myself ""oh my god, I just poisoned this beautiful woman."" Well, come to find out, after going back over every thing I bought and researching a little more online, guess what I found? Apparently, I bought a well-known product that even though it was labeled as ""gluten free,"" it had been a recalled product dated just a week prior for ""containing gluten,"" as you might have guessed. I was still somehow able to buy it and feed it to some one else that had an adverse reaction, which I could do nothing about at the time. NOT OK!
The Present
We are Ingredient Identity, a preeminent regulatory management consulting firm specializing in safety and compliance for a variety of industries, but most notably for Food, Beverage and Dietary Supplement companies around the world. For starters, we provide consulting on FDA matters for these types of products and on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for literally every aspect of our clients' quality and regulatory operations, starting with the ingredients they use in their products all the way through to ensuring that the marketing and labeling of the finished products conform with the applicable regulations so the products are safe to be consumed. However, most importantly, the reason why we are so driven to do what we do is that we are dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of end consumers.
We are a privately held, self-funded, ~five year old start-up with a very strong track record of growth, and driven by our dedication to identifying the right projects and right clients. We reinvest heavily in our people and systems, and related technologies to ensure strong added value to the projects we take on, especially when it comes to highly complex quality issues. We've developed some of the most cost-effective solutions for some of the most well known brands in the Food, Beverage and Dietary Supplement industries and we're only getting started. We've designed our operations with efficient and scalable technologies, incorporating Best Compliance Practices©, and leveraging the extensive scientific and regulatory expertise of our team to help reduce clients' overall legal and regulatory risks when it comes to developing, manufacturing and marketing Foods, Beverage and Dietary Supplements. Now we are ready for the next step!
We aim to build out a new offering and technology platform based on what services we already provide and what we have already built (moGMP™). Our intent is to expand this technology as a service to make it easier for our clients, but more importantly for their end customers ""the consumers"" to access real-time compliance and safety information about the foods, beverages and/or dietary supplements (and ingredients) that they consume either before, during or after consumption. This includes any health, ingredient or related claims!


Food and Dietary Supplement product recalls and other safety warnings are rampant in the news at present, often resulting from issues like undeclared allergens like my own personal story above or unexpected microbial contaminations, which are entirely too common. The lawsuits following such events are also sky rocketing and don't really benefit most consumers as a whole. These types of events can also include deliberate adulteration with ingredients not allowed in food products, such as certain drugs or other controlled substances not to mention counterfeit products! Unfortunately, not all companies in these industries have good business ethics or comply with the FDA's GMP regulations all the time whether based in the United States or abroad, and the FDA can only regulate so much given its limited resources. Moreover, numerous companies do not have sufficient product recall procedures (if any) or no experience in actually conducting a product recall even though this is a federal requirement, which leaves consumers at high risk of getting hurt. If you have ever consumed a food product and were sickened due to E. Coli contamination, Salmonella contamination, or perhaps an undeclared allergen such as Gluten, Shellfish or Peanut, or some drug active ingredient, this is situation we are tackling head on! This is what I'm talking about and why we are here asking for your support today, to help build out this technology as a service and take consumer food safety to the next level!
The Reality.
Adverse Event Reporting (AER) and Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAER) to the FDA are requirements by law, but still go largely unenforced due to the sheer number of companies and products out in the marketplace. Even for those companies touting consumer health and safety as paramount, all too often they conduct business with that being much less of a priority. By the time a warning notice or product recall hits the press that you ""might"" read about, whether announced by the company itself or directly by the FDA, it is too late for dozens if not hundreds or more consumers already sickened or worse. Trust me, I know! We handle these matters all the time for our clients. The consumers though, the people like you and me, won't get the message or even really ever know what happened, and have little recourse not to mention possible unexpected medical bills. We can absolutely change this in 2016 and beyond!


We aim to change this in fact, by putting the power of food and ingredient safety information into the hands of consumers utilizing already existing technology in such a way that we've developed that helps them to make more informed decisions before putting such products in their bodies as well as after, and we want to accomplish this much sooner than later with your help here today!
   
 We are talking about ensuring food safety for consumers of foods, beverages and dietary supplements, which last we checked, is pretty much everyone. We want to build the next generation of compliance and safety reporting technology targeting consumer products starting with Foods, Beverages and Supplements that consumers can access on their mobile smartphone to ensure 100% transparency and traceability of all such products and ingredients thereof. If there is a claim, you should know why it is on the product and if it is allowed. If there is an ingredient in the product you don't recognized, you should be able instantly research it so as to make a real-time educated decision about the product. If there is a safety concern or recall, you should know immediately!
The budget we've identified to help us start down this path is a very conservative $380,000 USD, but with more, we'll do more...and we mean we will do a lot more a lot faster! The system design and workflows are already complete, and the regulatory and scientific expertise needed to ensure the accuracy and applicability of the information captured resides within the very people work at this company. In fact this is already the type of work our amazing team supports day in and day out. And we aren't starting from scratch, as we've already launched our smartphone app for our business clients available on iTunes and Google Play (moGMP™). However, we need expand this technology as a service further on a sophisticated database driven platform that simplifies the overall process for our clients and their consumers to access and qualify information that already exists with the companies making such products, and that is required to be available/accessible by law. Most importantly, such a system could greatly reduce upfront costs of product development in these industries, while ensuring compliant labels or label claims on the product are permitted based on the
 regulations that apply. Literally, we are already doing this manually 
for our clients, and by raising money we will be able to do the 
following:







As a consumer yourself, imagine having the power to verify the quality, compliance and safety of a product before making that final purchase decision about any food, beverage or dietary supplement product you are considering to put into your body or give to your children or other loved ones. Then imagine having the piece of mind in that if a health issue were to arise after buying a specific product, you would be notified promptly (via our enhanced app) of any issues thereby avoiding a potential health nightmare. We can make this a reality with your help!
    
 There is no question that technology enables consumers to have greater buying power when they are shopping either online or in-store. While some companies embrace technology to reach consumers, few use it to ensure those same consumers are protected or informed about the products being sold to them, especially after the purchase. Additionally, because companies making Foods, Beverages and Dietary Supplement or ingredients thereof, are so diverse and fragmented, the result is a continual reoccurrence of safety and health issues that we read about in the news...mass food recalls, etc. 
Fancy packaging or flashy bottles, celebrity endorsements, key positioning and other creative marketing infomercials will always be important to these products, but we want to help ensure there is more ""accountability"" by such companies making these products. Companies embracing this technology and related services will have a tremendous advantage to build consumer loyalty, by giving consumers, unprecedented access to fundamental quality and safety information about the products...something that is not readily available in these industries for consumers and should be. I'm talking real transparency with the foods you eat! Let's make it better today, and not just talk about it!
The advantages of what we want to build though are not only for consumers - oh no, rather contrary. The companies embracing this technology and related services will have the ability to refine and differentiate their product(s), show traceability of a given products' compliance and label claims at all times, and educate their consumer(s) in the now. More importantly, for products that have been contaminated or recalled, which are either still on store shelves or have already been purchased, instant push-message notifications from the app (by respective brand holder) about the urgent matter or other critical recommendations to that specific consumer who purchased their product, exudes increased corporate social responsibility. It is not only a competitive advantage in general, but a tool to help mitigate non-compliance events, which can have tremendous legal and regulatory cost advantages down the road. We know the numbers! We
 plan to create a highly proactive solution to a common unfortunate 
reactive-only matter, and we want to bring it to market with your help!
Your contribution will have the following impact on what we finally launch:

<p>
The original team member Kristina and her friends were passionate about finding a way to connect with new people in a safe and friendly manner. Having spent lots of time looking at different ideas for online dating, social meet ups and shared interest groups, they came up with the idea of helping people to take online social interaction into a face to face scenario in a safe and friendly way, and Friendly Lights was born.</p>

 At this stage Aleh became a part of the team, with a software development background, and the idea was fast became a reality.
After many sessions brainstorming on the idea and trying out various concepts, the team finally arrived at the traditional traffic light system, a universal visual concept that is simple to use and understand. After months of product prototyping and software development, the team are now ready to go to the next level and bring the product into full development.

<p>We've worked hard to minimize the risks associated with this project. The product has already gone through several design/prototyping stages and tests. Android application is almost finished, IOS and Windows Phone versions are required to be done. We have qualified our manufacturers and first-level fulfillment partners.

<p>Thanks for help.</p></div>","Friendly Lights is the new social interaction device designed to help you meet people, at the right time, in the right place and the right mood.Friendly Lights is a locator device that can be worn as a wristband, on a keychain or clipped onto your jacket, connecting users via a map of their local area, highlighting availability, location and intention to meet new people and make new friends.

Friendly lights is an interactive wearable technology device that helps you to meet people in a simple, friendly and safe way.
We do not collect personal data, we are helping people to build new relationships!
What are the statuses?
The standard traffic lights system makes Friendly Lights the perfect communication tool for meeting people. Everyone knows green is for go and red is for stop, yellow – maybe. 












I want to make friends! Let's talk!
I'm not sure, perhaps I want to meet new people.
I'm not interested in meeting new people.

So wherever you go you can meet others in similar mood using the map and activating your device, in real time.  Please visit our  Site for more details.How does Friendly Lights Improve social connection?If you’ve ever moved to a new town to start College, a new job, or you just want to make some new friends, you would know how hard it can be to meet people who are also interested in making new connections.Wouldn’t it be great to know who is open to meet new people, where they are and when they are available?
The standard traffic lights system makes Friendly Lights the perfect communication tool for meeting people. Everyone knows green is for go and red is for stop, yellow – maybe.

How does it look like?
Here the first stage prototypes.

















 We don't focuse on bracelet types and colours, custom wrist watch strap can be simply attached to the device. More images and details at  Friendly Lights Site .  Here the second stage prototypes.  If we reach  goal more than $70.000, we will release these samples.







How to use it?
Friendly Lights works with a mobile application that simply adds each locator device to the Friendly Lights map of the local
area, allowing all users to see who is active and where they are.








There is no need to fill in personal details, this is not about personal data collection, just connect your device and go. Simply connect your Friendly Lights locator to your mobile
 phone using the latest Bluetooth technology, set your mood on your 
wearable device, and activate your setting on the friendly lights map. 

The Friendly Lights locator can also be linked to social networks
such as LinkedIn and Facebook, enhancing your social profile.
First use case, sport events.

Second use case, party.
This third use case.
This third use case only for individuals and small companies wishing to provide services, which is rapidly changing the status of free/busy. We are doing two branches: first one for persons and second one for services, now we have plans to release only for persons.
How Friendly Lights helps your businessIf you’re working as a freelancer, have your own small business and are seeking new customers, then set your friendly lights locator to indicate where you are, when you’re available and simply let your new customers find you.
It’s simple, once you set up your profile, simply activate your mood according to your availability, ready for work? Then it’s green for go. Busy right now? Then it’s red for stop. If you’re soon to be available? Then activate yellow.

<h3><b>The Big Vision</b></h3>
<p>In our world, we face huge, urgent, seemingly insurmountable problems, most of which are all already falling under the larger umbrella of climate change: persistent structural racism, economic inequality and environmental devastation. To face these tremendous challenges, we need our leaders and community members to be healthy and building sustainable lives of joy and fulfillment both in and outside of the work place. We need organizations linked into a larger collective movement, with big, open, inclusive visions, the ability to move past assumptions and habits, think outside of the box and nurture long-term, committed employees in a supportive work environment. As I coach I want to work to support individuals and organizations to embrace their most ""unreasonable"" visions, strengthen their relationships both internally and externally, and create an awesome work environment for their staff and volunteer leadership.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to meet Melanie in June of 2013.  A middle school teacher at the end of the school year, I was drained, exhausted, and struggling with chronic anxiety, chronic fatigue, bloating, fatigue after eating, diarrhea, dark under-eye circles, irregular periods and severe PMS.  Meeting Melanie was a breath of fresh air - her expertise and her ability to truly listen and hear my needs, guided our creation of a GAPS diet that worked with my lifestyle.  She supported me through a dramatic GAPS Stage 1 diet, in which I experienced a great deal of detox reactions, and then through the process of transitioning to the normal GAPS diet.  Her patience and availability was unfailing, and I knew she was there to support me through choosing the best probiotic for my system, to sending me the best recipe in the whole world for homemade mayonnaise.  After being on the full GAPS diet for 5 months, I feel more at home in my body than I have since childhood - it has allowed me to return home to myself.  My anxiety is gone, I feel energized after eating, have no food cravings whatsoever (goodbye sugar - hurray!), my digestion is strong and regular, my periods are regular, my PMS is much less, and I now have flawless skin with no under-eye circles.  I will be forever grateful to Melanie for helping me to find myself again.<b> ~ Gretchen Miller, educator</b><br/></p>
<p>Melanie was fantastic and thorough to work with.  She helped me understand our family diet better and minimize the anxiety I have over nutrition.  We've incorporated a lot of the changes into our daily routines, and I often check my notes and emails from her sessions when I need help with something.  The Skype calls were flexible, wonderful and worked well with our lifestyle.  I would highly recommend Melanie to anyone seriously seeking to maximize their nutrition, and for a thorough, comprehensive and custom plan of action.<b> ~Vesna L.<br/></b></p>
<p>Working with Melanie has been a huge step and gift to me in nourishing my family and doing everything I can to help us obtain and maintain optimal health. We started out with my three year old who has asthma and food allergies seeking to help her body and particularly her immune system to function as best it can. While she was our main focus, every member of my family has benefitted tremendously from this partnership. My daughter is doing well and her immune system seems to be functioning better than it has in the past. My year-and-a-half year old son increased his concentration remarkably and became more relaxed and less high-needs. My husband has more energy now and usually refuses to eat things he was not eager to give up in the beginning because he feels so much better now. Severe painful eczema had begun to plague me and is now under control. I’m also enjoying improved mood and overall functioning.</p>
<p>Although I had learned much about nourishing and traditional foods as well as GAPS on my own, Melanie helped me to take more steps to get our family fully on track and the results have been more than worth the investment. She made changes that seemed overwhelming on my own manageable by helping me to put a plan in place. Melanie is an encouraging, knowledgeable, and supportive coach, and I’m so thankful for the privilege of working with her and will turn to her again as a resource as needed in the future.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> ~Beth H.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></p>

The good news is that there are solutions that can fight this 'dragon' regardless of the pathophysiology that brought it... 
A primary one being the therapeutic use of FOOD. 


The families I work with want to make changes smartly... supported with practitioner guidance and a community of friends who understand the inherent challenges and rewards involved.




This is what I'm passionate about. 

And I need a ballyhoo (clamorous and vigorous attempt) to advance this cause.

<br/><h3><b>Our Story</b></h3>
<p>HOLA Hospice, which
translates to “Hospice of the Angels,"" is both a <b>California
501(c)(3) Non-Profit Corporation and Mexican nonprofit organization A.C.
(Associación civil)</b> established in <b>2013</b>
<u>to provide direct care to terminally ill patients in Morelia, the capital
city of the state of Michoacán, Mexico.</u></p>
<p>Elena Lopez, a licensed
vocational nurse and a graduate of Pacific Coast College, is the HOLA Hospice founder.
She is a longtime dedicated hospice nurse and has 25 years of experience as a
case manager, having worked at the City of Angels Hospice, AIDS Healthcare
Foundation, St Vincent’s Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente and IPC In-Patient
Consultants in California. In 1991 she went to Michoacán to personally care for
her dying grandmother and encountered <b>many other people</b>
<b>who were suffering from a lack of basic medical
resources such as pain medications and oxygen to relieve the agonizing symptoms
of their terminal illness. </b></p>
<p>Realizing the
alarming need for in-home hospice care and the greater necessity for a hospice
facility, Ms. Lopez made a commitment to provide compassionate care to terminally
ill patients and their loved ones. </p>
<p>We are currently
working towards two specific goals, and have made significant progress for both:</p>
<p>* The first goal is
to fund a one year program for a dedicated team of skilled and experienced professionals<b> to care for people facing a terminal illness in the comfort of their
own homes, free of charge to the patient</b>. <u>This will be the first program to provide hospice care
in Morelia, Michoacán.</u></p>

interdisciplinary team is already in place in Morelia
and will provide in home hospice services as soon as funds  are available. </span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>* The second, a
longer-term goal, is to <b>build the first hospice
facility</b> <b>in Morelia, Michoacán</b>,
accommodating 30 patients. The team at this facility will collaborate with
hospitals and local universities including: La Universidad de San Nicolás de
Hidalgo, Instituto Tecnológico de Morelia and La Universidad de la Salle’s psychology department internship program.</p>

state of Michoacán donated the land
for the hospice site in June of 2015, thanks in part to Lolita Gutierrez,
president of the Federación de Michoacanos in California. Doho Constructivo and La Universidad de la
Salle are currently designing the
facility pro bono, based on hospice facilities research
in Europe and the US.</span><br/>

<p></p>
<p><b>Hospice care is for patients
whose life expectancy is likely to be six months or less. </b>Hospice care
professionals help patients and their families understand treatment options and
make critical informed decisions so that they may have peace, comfort and
dignity during the natural process of death. </p>
<p>HOLA Hospice is a team of interdisciplinary
professionals specializing in hospice and palliative care. <b>We focus on pain and
symptom management, holistic care, and providing access to local health care
programs and resources for terminally ill patients while educating their
families to care for their loved ones at home.</b></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hospice care
programs and facilities offer <b>vital end of life services
which are readily available in the</b> <b>United
States </b>through 5,500 hospice facilities.  In 2013 the National Hospice and Palliative
Care Organization estimated that <b>1.1 million people in the
United States </b>died under the care of a hospice program, and that
number continues to climb as more hospice facilities open each year nationwide.
However, in many other places of the world, hospice care is not always an
option.</p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p><u>Mexico has a
population of 122 million people but there are approximately only
10 stand-alone hospice facilities in the entire country<b>.  In the state of Michoacán,
with a population of 4.5 million people, there are currently no hospice
facilities.</b></u></p>
<p>Your donations to
HOLA Hospice will benefit approximately 5-10% of the population in Michoacán,
Mexico.</p>

<p>HOLA met Daisy when
she was 7 years old. At the time she was terminally ill with leukemia, and she
lived with her family and brothers in Cotija, Michoacán. HOLA provided
transportation for Daisy and her parents to her chemotherapy appointments in
Morelia, making a 150-mile trip each way for several months. When she passed,
HOLA offered one year of bereavement counseling and support to her family.</p>

Ángeles,"" es una organización sin fines de lucro  en California 501 (c) (3) al igual que en
México AC (Asociación civil), establecida en 2013 para brindar atención directa
a enfermos terminales en Morelia,  la
capital del estado de Michoacán, México.</p>
<p>Elena López, una enfermera vocacional graduada de la universidad de la
Costa del Pacífico, es la fundadora de HOLA Hospicio. Como enfermera de hospicio,
y  administradora de casos, ella cuenta
con 25 años de experiencia  y ha
trabajado en el hospicio  City of Angeles
Hospice, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, St Vicent’s Medical Center,  Kaiser Permanente y en IPC In-Paciente
Consultants en California. En 1991 se fue a Michoacán para cuidar personalmente
a su abuela  moribunda y se encontró con
muchas otras personas que sufrían de una falta de recursos médicos básicos,
como medicamentos para el dolor y el oxígeno para aliviar los síntomas
agonizantes de su enfermedad terminal.</p>
<p>Al darse cuenta de la alarmante  falta de cuidado de hospicio
en el hogar y la gran necesidad de un hospicio permanente, la Srta. López se
comprometió a brindar atención compasiva a pacientes con enfermedades
terminales y a sus seres queridos.</p>
<p>Actualmente estamos trabajando en dos objetivos específicos, y hemos
progresado significativamente en ambos:</p>
<p>• El primer objetivo es financiar un programa de un año para que un
equipo de expertos profesionales calificados puedan cuidar a los enfermos
terminales en la comodidad de sus propios hogares. Este será el primer programa
para proporcionar Cuidados Paliativos en Morelia, Michoacán.</p>
<p>• Nuestra  situación actual: En
Morelia un equipo interdisciplinario  ya
esta seleccionado y proporcionará servicios de hospicio domiciliario tan pronto
como se disponga de fondos.</p>
<p>• El segundo, un objetivo a más largo plazo, es la construcción del
primer hospicio en Morelia, Michoacán, con capacidad para 30 pacientes. El
equipo de este centro colaborará con los hospitales y las universidades
locales, como: La Universidad de San Nicolás de Hidalgo, Instituto Tecnológico
de Morelia y  el programa de
internados  del departamento de
psicología  en La Universidad de la
Salle.</p>
<p>• Estado actual: El gobierno del estado de Michoacán ha donado el
terreno para  la construcción del
hospicio, gracias en parte a Lolita Gutiérrez, presidenta de la Federación de
Michoacanos en California. Actualmente Doho Constructivo y La Universidad de la
Salle están diseñando el hospicio pro bono, basándose en una investigación
de  las instalaciones de Cuidados
Paliativos en Europa y los Estados Unidos.</p>
<h3><b>Misión de HOLA</b></h3>
<p><b>El cuidado de hospicio es para
los pacientes cuya expectativa de vida es probablemente de seis meses o menos.</b>  Los profesionales del cuidado de hospicio
ayudan a los pacientes y sus familias a entender las opciones de tratamiento y
tomar decisiones críticas acertadas para que puedan tener  tranquilidad, comodidad y dignidad durante el
proceso natural de la muerte.</p>
<p><b>HOLA Hospicio es un equipo
de profesionales interdisciplinarios especializados en Cuidados Paliativos y de
hospicio.  Nos enfocamos en el control del dolor, el manejo de los
síntomas, cuidados holísticos, el acceso a recursos y programas de
atención de salud locales para pacientes con enfermedades terminales, a la vez
que educamos a sus familias para cuidar
a sus seres queridos en casa.</b></p>
<h3><b>El Impacto</b></h3>
<p>En Estados Unidos existen 5,500 programas e instalaciones  que ofrecen Cuidados Paliativos y de
hospicio. En 2013, la Organización Nacional de Hospicios y Cuidados Paliativos
estimó que 1.1 millones de personas en los Estados Unidos murieron bajo el
cuidado de un programa de hospicio, y cada año ese número sigue aumentando a
medida que más hospicios abren sus puertas en todo el país.  Sin embargo en muchas otros lugares del mundo
el cuidado de hospicio no siempre es una opción. </p>
<p>México tiene una población de 122 millones de personas, pero hay
aproximadamente sólo 10 centros de Cuidados Paliativos independientes en todo
el país. <b>En el estado de Michoacán, con
una población de 4.5 millones de personas, en estos momentos no existe ninguna instalación para cuidados de Hospicio.</b></p>
<p>Sus donaciones a HOLA Hospicio beneficiarán a aproximadamente 5-10% de
la población en Michoacán, México.</p>

<p>HOLA conoció a  Daisy cuando ella
tenía 7 años de edad. En ese momento ella sufría gravemente de leucemia aguda,
y vivía con su familia y hermanos en Cotija, Michoacán. HOLA proporcionó
transporte para Daisy y sus padres a sus citas de quimioterapia en
Morelia.  Hacían este viaje de 150 millas
en cada sentido durante varios meses. Cuando falleció, HOLA ofreció a su
familia un año de orientación y apoyo para el duelo.</p>

Our Story
HOLA Hospice, which
translates to “Hospice of the Angels,"" is both a California
501(c)(3) Non-Profit Corporation and Mexican nonprofit organization A.C.
(Associación civil) established in 2013
to provide direct care to terminally ill patients in Morelia, the capital
city of the state of Michoacán, Mexico.
Elena Lopez, a licensed
vocational nurse and a graduate of Pacific Coast College, is the HOLA Hospice founder.
She is a longtime dedicated hospice nurse and has 25 years of experience as a
case manager, having worked at the City of Angels Hospice, AIDS Healthcare
Foundation, St Vincent’s Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente and IPC In-Patient
Consultants in California. In 1991 she went to Michoacán to personally care for
her dying grandmother and encountered many other people
who were suffering from a lack of basic medical
resources such as pain medications and oxygen to relieve the agonizing symptoms
of their terminal illness. 
Realizing the
alarming need for in-home hospice care and the greater necessity for a hospice
facility, Ms. Lopez made a commitment to provide compassionate care to terminally
ill patients and their loved ones. 
We are currently
working towards two specific goals, and have made significant progress for both:
* The first goal is
to fund a one year program for a dedicated team of skilled and experienced professionals to care for people facing a terminal illness in the comfort of their
own homes, free of charge to the patient. This will be the first program to provide hospice care
in Morelia, Michoacán.


Our current status: An
interdisciplinary team is already in place in Morelia
and will provide in home hospice services as soon as funds  are available. 

* The second, a
longer-term goal, is to build the first hospice
facility in Morelia, Michoacán,
accommodating 30 patients. The team at this facility will collaborate with
hospitals and local universities including: La Universidad de San Nicolás de
Hidalgo, Instituto Tecnológico de Morelia and La Universidad de la Salle’s psychology department internship program.


 Our current status: The government of the
state of Michoacán donated the land
for the hospice site in June of 2015, thanks in part to Lolita Gutierrez,
president of the Federación de Michoacanos in California. Doho Constructivo and La Universidad de la
Salle are currently designing the
facility pro bono, based on hospice facilities research
in Europe and the US.

HOLA’s Mission

Hospice care is for patients
whose life expectancy is likely to be six months or less. Hospice care
professionals help patients and their families understand treatment options and
make critical informed decisions so that they may have peace, comfort and
dignity during the natural process of death. 
HOLA Hospice is a team of interdisciplinary
professionals specializing in hospice and palliative care. We focus on pain and
symptom management, holistic care, and providing access to local health care
programs and resources for terminally ill patients while educating their
families to care for their loved ones at home.
The Impact

Hospice care
programs and facilities offer vital end of life services
which are readily available in the United
States through 5,500 hospice facilities.  In 2013 the National Hospice and Palliative
Care Organization estimated that 1.1 million people in the
United States died under the care of a hospice program, and that
number continues to climb as more hospice facilities open each year nationwide.
However, in many other places of the world, hospice care is not always an
option.

Mexico has a
population of 122 million people but there are approximately only
10 stand-alone hospice facilities in the entire country.  In the state of Michoacán,
with a population of 4.5 million people, there are currently no hospice
facilities.
Your donations to
HOLA Hospice will benefit approximately 5-10% of the population in Michoacán,
Mexico.

Already Making
a Difference




HOLA met Daisy when
she was 7 years old. At the time she was terminally ill with leukemia, and she
lived with her family and brothers in Cotija, Michoacán. HOLA provided
transportation for Daisy and her parents to her chemotherapy appointments in
Morelia, making a 150-mile trip each way for several months. When she passed,
HOLA offered one year of bereavement counseling and support to her family.

What We Need and Why


The $75,000 raised will enable HOLA Hospice to provide in-home hospice care for 20 patients
a week for one year, offering necessary psycho-social services, medications, medical
equipment and bereavement programs at the
patient’s residence by a full-time team of hospice
professionals: 1 doctor, 1 psychologist, 2 nurses, 1 dietician, 2
social workers, 5 home health aides, 2 spiritual/bereavement counselors, and 15
volunteers.
This start-up
capital campaign constitutes only a portion of our overall long-term budget.

<p>We at DoctorSigma are a team of Futurists, Technologists, Data Scientists and

<p>We have started building a solution for

We provide an online platform, which allows you to
     access on your phone/tablet/PC, your medical reports sent by the diagnostic center which you can share it with your
     doctor for consultation, all from the comfort of your home. 

You also get
     access to all your historical medical records (EMR) in one place and can select
     and share these reports to other doctors as well, for a second opinion with
     just a couple of clicks. So now you do not need to make multiple
     non-essential trips to the clinic.

With the DoctorSigma App, the diagnostic centers will
     upload your test results online directly to you, which will give you complete control

The doctor gets access to the reports which you share
and shall provide his observations and
     prescriptions online which only you can access. 
So now get your reports and consultations at home!
Additionally, we also provide you with unique state-of-the-art technology ""Healthcare Predictive analysis"". We will provide you with preventive healthcare solutions based on the statistics collected in your region, and also suggest corrective measures for improving living conditions to avoid prevalent diseases.Lets take a scenario: Jim is a business traveller, who often travels to developing nations for meetings. On one such trip, he contracts a deadly virus which is diagnosed on his return. However, if he uses the DoctorSigma App, he will be informed about the potential risks of prevalent diseases in the region based on live statistical data, even before reaching his destination and he will be offered suggestions on preventive steps to avoid contracting the virus.

The Reach!


Although these are typical problems faced majorly in developing countries but some of the developed nations also face similar scenarios, therefore, we are striving to
create massive impact to billions of people. 
We research health patterns,
medical diagnostics, diseases, medicines and cures. and are also driven towards using smart predicting techniques for any outbreak of epidemics or disease.

<h3></h3>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Struggling to eat better? You are not alone! Making healthy food choices is harder than expected because the majority of them are based on convenience. Perhaps it is our busy schedule and limited time to prepare healthy 
meals. When our schedule starts to interfere with healthy eating 
habits, we start skipping meals and choose convenient or fast 
foods to eat instead. This brings us to today where 70% of all eating out consumption happens at a fast food restaurant, being readily available, inexpensive and filling and... unhealthy.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Meet Salad Street - America's own drive thru salad bar. Featuring made-to-order salads, wraps, power smoothies and  a chidren's menu;  we are changing 
the
 way we eat fast food one drive thru at a time. From our locally sourced
 fruits and vegetables to our hormone free proteins we can finally feel 
good about what we eat. With business hours from 6am to 10pm we offer healthy and nutritious breakfast, lunch and dinner meals, all through the convenience of a drive thru.<br/></p>
<p>Our first location is set to open in northern Chicago land and we will then rapidly expand throughout the country.
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>About Us<br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is Vladimir Cvetkov and I am the founder of Salad Street. I have over a decade of restaurant experience. Throughout my career I have been able to turn around or build from scratch a hand full of  restaurants. Facing serious health problems in 2014, just a month after my 30th birthday, I realized the importance of healthy eating and decided to take my experience and knowledge in the restaurant industry and fix the problem that we all face, the lack of convenient healthy food options. The team that I have assembled to date has over 4 decades of combined restaurant experience!</p>

<h3>What we need<br/>
</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our projected start up cost is $230,000 which includes the menu, recipe development, site selection, build out, marketing and working capital. Although we are using personal savings and help from friends and family, we still need to raise close to $80,000 to ensure the healthy start of our venture.</p>
<p>There
 are so many variables that go into setting a price point when it comes 
to opening a restaurant.  After much research, here are the main numbers that determine the capital needed:</p>
<p>Website and intellectual property - $19,000.<br/></p>
<p>Menu development - $11,000.</p>
<p>Site build out and equipment - $105,000.</p>
<p>Inventory $15,000.</p>
<p>Marketing - $20,000.</p>
<p>Working capital - $80,000.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our mission is to offer healthy, sustainable and affordable food in the most convenient manner. We are the next generation fast food drive thru restaurant.</p>
<p>When we take care of ourselves by eating healthy  we are more 
focused, more productive, more efficient, and above all healthy!</p>
<p>A section of our menu will be dedicated to Superfood meals that are proven cancer fighters. From broccoli and berries to nuts and beans, we will offer delicious plant based  made-to-order meals that will help us prevent and fight cancer. We will then donate a portion of the sales to people in our local communities fighting cancer.<br/></p> <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>We have worked for over a year developing Salad Street's concept, recipes and menu.  Assembling

<p>In 2011,CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) pointed out about 1 in 12 Americans suffered from asthma and the numbers were increasing every year.Poor air quality is one of the main reasons for an asthma attack. </p>
<p>In 2014, report from ALA(American Lung Association) showed that 47% of residents in the United States had been living in polluted air circumstance, according to the air quality index statistics of EPA(US Environmental Protection Agency). </p>
<p>Now air pollution has become a global problem, which is severely threatening our health. Therefore, we start this healthy life campaign. We are committed to help us eliminate various of air pollutions so that everyone can enjoy a healthier life.</p>
<p>Today we develop a smart AI to solve kinds of air problems.We hope that the smart AI not only can detect pollutions, but eliminating pollutions. Health is everyone’s basic human right.</p>
<p>After all, our capability is limited, so we sincerely hope everyone browsed this campaign could share AI with your friends, simply by clicking the “Share” button on left side. Please let more friends know and keep healthy. </p>
<p>Every backer will receive a mysterious gift for free, if you share AI on Facebook and send the screenshot to our Facebook page.</p>

<p>In our daily life, we may often see some particles suspending in the air. According to their diameter, they are divided into several categories.</p>
</div>
<div><p>Over
90% of particles, which are bigger than 10 μm, will be kept outside our body by
our nose hair and snot and sometime you may find black dust in your nose.</p></div>
<div><p>While particles, with diameter smaller than or equal to 10 μm, will be inhaled into our respiratory tract through nose. Therefore, it is called inhalable particulate matter or PM10 for short. Don’t worry too much about it. Cilium in upper respiratory tract swing 20 times per second, attaching PM10 to its mucus and pushing them to the throat. At last, PM10 will be swollen or coughed up. </p></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>Particles, which are smaller than or equal to 2.5 μm, can easily pass through the upper and lower respiratory tract and reach the alveoli at last. That is PM2.5. Consisting of some toxic substances, for example, soot and dust, PAHs, heavy metals, PM2.5 will trigger leucocytes and lymphocytes to fight against themselves on its way to lower respiratory tract, causing various inflammations. After reaching the alveoli, PM2.5 will do harm to pulmonary ventilation function, making people easily deprived of oxygen. Even though macrophages can hardly break down some harmful substances, such as heavy metals. On the contrary, macrophages will break and die for it is difficult to decompose, causing a decrease in immunity. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Among those particles, which are
smaller than 0.5μm, can directly pass through alveoli into blood, injuring intima of blood
vessels and narrowing blood vessels. This will cause a rise in blood pressure
and trigger thrombosis. It can even reach the heart through blood
circulation, resulting in cardiac ischemia, myocardial injury, arrhythmia and
myocardial infarction. </p>
<p></p>
<p>For now, the United States, the UK, France, India and China are the world’s most polluted countries of PM2.5 and millions of people die from air pollution every year. PNAS has reported that air pollution may cut our lifespan by 5.5 years. </p>

<p>In recent years, WHO has monitored air
quality in more than 1,600 cities, finding only 12% of residents has access to
qualified air and more than 50% of the cities pollutant is over 250%.</p>On the other hand, the report shows that negative oxygen can degrade dust, PM10, PM2.5 in the air and purify pungent odors. Therefore, the higher concentration of negative oxygen in the air is, the fresher the air is, which makes negative oxygen widely applied in air freshener.<br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In nature, lighting and water can ionize a
large amount of electrons, which contribute to negative oxygen after being
captured by oxygen molecules. Therefore, the air is always exceptionally pure
and fresh after rain. </p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443947476/kvhlrpcl4mytydeictwq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Near the forest, waterfalls and seaside,
the negative oxygen is usually more than 10,000 pcs/cm³, we can feel the
particularly fresh air when we stay there. While the negative oxygen in
air-conditioned room is less than 50 pcs/cm³ and the average negative oxygen in
city is not more than 200 pcs/cm³. </p>
<span></span>
</div>
<div><p>At the same time, negative oxygen is more
absorbable. Besides degrading dust, it can also reduce lactic acid in muscles,
relieve fatigue, promote sleep and improve cardiovascular circulation.
Therefore, people live in the place with high concentration of negative oxygen,
such as forest and seaside, can live a longer and healthier life than others. </p></div>
<div><p>By high-pressure ionization and oxygen
molecule association, AI stimulates generation process of negative oxygen.
Combining a large amount of electrons and oxygen molecules, it can produce 24
million negative oxygen per second. It makes you enjoy your life as if you were
in the natural and fresh air and live a healthy life. </p></div>

About Pollution


In 2011,CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) pointed out about 1 in 12 Americans suffered from asthma and the numbers were increasing every year.Poor air quality is one of the main reasons for an asthma attack. 
In 2014, report from ALA(American Lung Association) showed that 47% of residents in the United States had been living in polluted air circumstance, according to the air quality index statistics of EPA(US Environmental Protection Agency). 
Now air pollution has become a global problem, which is severely threatening our health. Therefore, we start this healthy life campaign. We are committed to help us eliminate various of air pollutions so that everyone can enjoy a healthier life.
Today we develop a smart AI to solve kinds of air problems.We hope that the smart AI not only can detect pollutions, but eliminating pollutions. Health is everyone’s basic human right.
After all, our capability is limited, so we sincerely hope everyone browsed this campaign could share AI with your friends, simply by clicking the “Share” button on left side. Please let more friends know and keep healthy. 
Every backer will receive a mysterious gift for free, if you share AI on Facebook and send the screenshot to our Facebook page.

What AI can do？AI is capable of monitoring temperature,
humidity and air quality. It helps to clean some harmful substances, including
PM2.5, formaldehyde, benzene, TVOC, pollen, dust,
secondhand smoke, hairs, and flocs. It can eliminate some pathogens such as
viruses, bacteria, fungus, etc.It may produce 24 million negative oxygen
per second. AI can also remove odor and clean air. It is an essential
all-in-1 smart air manager. 

What's inside?






 What is PM 2.5? 




In our daily life, we may often see some particles suspending in the air. According to their diameter, they are divided into several categories.

Over
90% of particles, which are bigger than 10 μm, will be kept outside our body by
our nose hair and snot and sometime you may find black dust in your nose.
While particles, with diameter smaller than or equal to 10 μm, will be inhaled into our respiratory tract through nose. Therefore, it is called inhalable particulate matter or PM10 for short. Don’t worry too much about it. Cilium in upper respiratory tract swing 20 times per second, attaching PM10 to its mucus and pushing them to the throat. At last, PM10 will be swollen or coughed up. 


Particles, which are smaller than or equal to 2.5 μm, can easily pass through the upper and lower respiratory tract and reach the alveoli at last. That is PM2.5. Consisting of some toxic substances, for example, soot and dust, PAHs, heavy metals, PM2.5 will trigger leucocytes and lymphocytes to fight against themselves on its way to lower respiratory tract, causing various inflammations. After reaching the alveoli, PM2.5 will do harm to pulmonary ventilation function, making people easily deprived of oxygen. Even though macrophages can hardly break down some harmful substances, such as heavy metals. On the contrary, macrophages will break and die for it is difficult to decompose, causing a decrease in immunity. 

Among those particles, which are
smaller than 0.5μm, can directly pass through alveoli into blood, injuring intima of blood
vessels and narrowing blood vessels. This will cause a rise in blood pressure
and trigger thrombosis. It can even reach the heart through blood
circulation, resulting in cardiac ischemia, myocardial injury, arrhythmia and
myocardial infarction. 

For now, the United States, the UK, France, India and China are the world’s most polluted countries of PM2.5 and millions of people die from air pollution every year. PNAS has reported that air pollution may cut our lifespan by 5.5 years. 



How to disinfect the room? 






UV
exposure for a long time will do harm our health. But UV-C can hardly
penetrate some materials like glass and plastic. Along with ZnO coating inside
it, AI can 100% keep UV-C outside and make you safe.


 
How to purify the air? 






 What is negative oxygen? 









In recent years, WHO has monitored air
quality in more than 1,600 cities, finding only 12% of residents has access to
qualified air and more than 50% of the cities pollutant is over 250%.On the other hand, the report shows that negative oxygen can degrade dust, PM10, PM2.5 in the air and purify pungent odors. Therefore, the higher concentration of negative oxygen in the air is, the fresher the air is, which makes negative oxygen widely applied in air freshener.


In nature, lighting and water can ionize a
large amount of electrons, which contribute to negative oxygen after being
captured by oxygen molecules. Therefore, the air is always exceptionally pure
and fresh after rain. 


Near the forest, waterfalls and seaside,
the negative oxygen is usually more than 10,000 pcs/cm³, we can feel the
particularly fresh air when we stay there. While the negative oxygen in
air-conditioned room is less than 50 pcs/cm³ and the average negative oxygen in
city is not more than 200 pcs/cm³. 


At the same time, negative oxygen is more
absorbable. Besides degrading dust, it can also reduce lactic acid in muscles,
relieve fatigue, promote sleep and improve cardiovascular circulation.
Therefore, people live in the place with high concentration of negative oxygen,
such as forest and seaside, can live a longer and healthier life than others. 
By high-pressure ionization and oxygen
molecule association, AI stimulates generation process of negative oxygen.
Combining a large amount of electrons and oxygen molecules, it can produce 24
million negative oxygen per second. It makes you enjoy your life as if you were
in the natural and fresh air and live a healthy life. 

THE APP







Who needs AI most? 






Automobile exhaust is one of the main pollution sources in our daily life. It is mainly composed of PM10, PM2.5, CO, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, heavy metals and so on, which contributes to respiratory diseases and various inflammations and long-term inhalation could even trigger malignant tumors and cardiovascular diseases. Even when you are exposed to all kinds of industrial and chemical pollution, AI will help to create a qualified air environment and enable your family to live an environmentally-friendly life. 




Smoking affects both
you and the ones you love. SHS is the one of the biggest indoor pollutant
sources, containing thousands of harmful substances, such as PM2.5, nicotine, coal tar, heavy
metals, nitrosamine, BaP and Po, may lead to asthma, pneumonia, heart disease,
genital hypoplasia and the risk of developing lung cancer is 260%~600% higher
than normal people. AI can quickly clean up the pollution and keep you away
from SHS. It is a loyal heath guardian for smokers and their families and
friends. 



Asthma is a common chronic
disease, which attacks repeatedly and can not be cured. Mites, pet hair, air
pollution, second hand smoking and pathogens in the air might be the trigger
for an asthma attack. The powerful purification of AI can quickly clean up air
pollution like PM10, PM2.5, TVOC, second hand smoking and pet hair. Also, it is
able to wipe out mites and pathogens in the air permanently. 

Being allergic to
pollen is a kind of common disease, it can trigger rhinitis, asthma, dermatitis and so on, which seriously
affect our health and life. AI’s powerful purification function can quickly
filtrate all kinds of pollens in the air and prevent your family away from being
disturbed by pollens and  asthma. 



Sub-health is one of
the biggest potential threats to modern people. Problems like malnutrition,
sleep deprivation, psychological stress, low spirits, lack of exercise and
sever fatigue will weaken our immunity system. But if we are exposed to
polluted environment, we will easily get sick. Besides cleaning up the air, the
sterilization function of AI can eliminate 99% of the pathogens within 1 second
and keep us away from diseases. 



Pets are our good
companions, but in the meanwhile, they bring hairs and parasites which are hard
to clean. The powerful purification function of AI can clean up hairs and in
the same time the sterilization function can eliminate various parasites. AI
helps your family live a healthy life with your pets. 



TVOC in furniture like formaldehyde,
benzene, and PM2.5, pathogens in the air will lead to different problems
including dizziness and headache, blunted in response, losing weight, nausea
and vomiting, neurasthenia, anemia, mental retardation and cancers. These will
do harm to children’s health. AI can purify all kinds of air pollutions,
eliminate pathogens, and remove odors, thus providing a safe environment for
our children. 







The research has shown air pollution like
PM2.5, TVOC, SHS will severely affect baby’s health, triggering all kinds of
congenital problems including premature births, low birth weight, nervous
system diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, cardiovascular diseases,
malformation and even SIDS. AI can quickly purify the air and clean various air
pollutions like PM 2.5, TVOC, SHS. It cares for pregnant women and babies all
the time. 





As we age, various functions in our body
decline and air pollutions pose threat to the old. PM 2.5, TVOC, dust and
various pathogens will trigger sore throat, trachitis, pneumonia,
cardiovascular diseases, cancers and even cerebral hemorrhage. AI can not only
purify the air and eliminate all kinds of pollutant air, the negative oxygen it
produce can also relieve fatigue, promote sleep, and improve cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases, helping the old live a long and healthy life. 






Many people choose indoor sports because of
their work and bad weather. Apart from building a safe sporting environment by
air purification and sterilization, AI can also produce negative oxygen which
can relieve fatigue when you are having aerobic exercise. Meanwhile, it can
strengthen the functions of heart and lung, promote sleep, and improve sport
quality, ensuring you a healthy life. 


Where
is it often used? 




AI is applied in various common
environments. Whether exhaust gas, pollen, PM2.5, TVOC from the windows when
you are driving or harmful substances like formaldehyde and benzene, dust,
hairs, flocs, mites in home, AI performs well in purification. AI can
effectively remove cooking fume, keep food away from invisible harmful particulate,
and purify all kinds of odors produced by household garbage. It can also
eliminate various pathogens, like viruses and bacteria, produce amount of
negative oxygen to relive fatigue, and strengthen cardiovascular circulation.
It is your necessary air minder.

TIMELINE












THE TEAM













Jinglin had studied two
master degrees in Australia. Those four years offered him insight into air
pollution. He decided to develop a smart air manager and help more people enjoy
a healthier life.



Tiange had four years designing experience. As a
sufferer of air pollution, she is allergic to pollen. During the time we
prepared our video, she suffered eyelid inflammation for weeks because of air
pollution. She detests these pollutions.


Kai has worked as an
electronics engineer for ten years. He had realized the impact of air pollution
during his wife’s pregnancy. Then he begun to study
the clearance of air pollution so babies will have a healthy, happy growing up
environment.

Yang had five years software
developing experience. This year he became a father. Same as Kai, he wishes his
son to stay away from air pollution and grow up healthily and happily. He
throws himself into the work of air pollution improvement.

Your help will allow us to set the base of triathlon in the country. With your contribution, Bahrain will have the chance to be represented by local athletes in several competitions (including World Championships).
Budget (for the upcoming 6 months)
Training equipment
x3 bikes for our youth athletes - 2400$
x6 turbo trainers - 1000$
x10 elastics bands - 200$
x4 swimming elastic cords - 400$
Physiological equipment for test - 800$
Training gear (t-shirts, shorts, swimsuits, etc...) - 800$

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<br/>Many risks and challenges are associated with opening a business of ANY kind, <br/>the vapor lounge\medical wellness center does not come without its fair share,<br/><br/>some of the problems we may encounter:<br/>- licensing through the city<br/>- new laws preventing the use of vaporizers<br/>- finding a property suitable for the business <br/><br/>What we plan to do to overcome those problems:<br/>- to solve any potential Licensing issues, we refer to currently operating lounges and the licensing they fall under and show those required that the established business model already works and works good.<br/>- the new laws, there is not much we can do unfortunately, but an extensive petitioning campaign could overcome that obstacle<br/>- as always with a business of this sort, finding a property suitable for this type of business will be difficult but not insurmountable, given Canada's stance on Cannabis and the potential of the laws changing soon more people are open and willing to permit this LEGAL business to open on their property. <br/> <br/>In conclusion, our goal is to help not only this city but the people that live in it too.<br/>although not everyone can contribute, helping can occur in many ways, simply by sharing this campaign with friends and family.<br/><br/>We thank you for taking the time to read our idea, we also thank those of you that have or will contribute, without you this just would not be possible.<br/>

Many risks and challenges are associated with opening a business of ANY kind, the vapor lounge\medical wellness center does not come without its fair share,some of the problems we may encounter:- licensing through the city- new laws preventing the use of vaporizers- finding a property suitable for the business What we plan to do to overcome those problems:- to solve any potential Licensing issues, we refer to currently operating lounges and the licensing they fall under and show those required that the established business model already works and works good.- the new laws, there is not much we can do unfortunately, but an extensive petitioning campaign could overcome that obstacle- as always with a business of this sort, finding a property suitable for this type of business will be difficult but not insurmountable, given Canada's stance on Cannabis and the potential of the laws changing soon more people are open and willing to permit this LEGAL business to open on their property.  In conclusion, our goal is to help not only this city but the people that live in it too.although not everyone can contribute, helping can occur in many ways, simply by sharing this campaign with friends and family.We thank you for taking the time to read our idea, we also thank those of you that have or will contribute, without you this just would not be possible.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My
name is Arlen Bento Jr. and I am the Co Founder and Co Owner of Fight Mite
Global LLC.  In early 2014, dust mites became a problem in my home as my
youngest son was having issues with allergies and congestion, especially in the
morning.  I was telling my business partner about my son and he told me
that he thought it was dust mites.  My partner was familiar with dust
mites because he had severe dust mite allergies. So our quest to help my son
started the development of Fight Mite Capture Pads.</p>
<p>Dust
mites are spider-like microscopic insects found by the thousands in many parts
of a house, such as mattresses, upholstered furniture, linen closets, carpets,
pillows and stuffed animals. Dust mites spend their life cycle eating human
skin flakes and eliminating waste. </p>
<p><b>According to the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), every home has significant levels of
dust mites. </b><b>Dust
mites are one of the leading causes of indoor allergies and asthma according to
the American Lung Association (ALA).  Dust mite infestations are so
prevalent that the ALA says that four out of five homes have some level of
detectable dust mite allergen in at least one of the home's beds.</b></p>
<p><b>The Asthma and
Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) estimates that about 20 million Americans
have a confirmed allergy to dust mites. Symptoms of dust mite allergy include
sneezing, watery eyes and a runny nose, according to WebMD. Dust mite droppings
and the shedding of their exoskeletons produce a harmful allergen that can
cause an allergic reaction and asthma in many people, especially children, with
dust mite allergy, cautions the EPA.</b></p>
<p><b>In fact, the American College of
Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) cites dust mites as the most common
cause of childhood asthma, and a trigger for 90% of people with asthma. Signs
of asthma in people with dust mite allergies include difficulty breathing,
tightness in the chest and wheezing, according to the Mayo Clinic.</b></p>
<p><b>The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) lists dust mites as a major asthma trigger and advises
affected individuals to take steps to eliminate dust mites from their homes and
to limit their exposure to dust mite allergens. The presence of dust mites can
lead to chronic illness, so it is important for people to take steps to get rid
of dust mite infestations to maintain a healthy home environment.</b></p>
<p>Then
the idea hit me?  What if we just get the dust mites out of the bedding or
at least come up with simple, easy to use and effective way to help detect, control and remove the dust mite populations in the bedding?  The idea for Fight Mite was born.</p>
<p>My
background is in business, sales and product development.  I started to do
my research into dust mites and I found that there was no simple way to help
people with the symptoms caused by dust mite allergies.  I learned that my
family alternatives were new bedding with expensive plastic covers, removing
rugs/carpeting, getting rid of our dog (my son loves his dog) and allergy shots
(ouch).</p>
<p>So,
with my background in product development and help from my two partners in
import / export we were able to create our product.</p>
<p>We
developed a simple product that captures dust mites for 90 days and started our
patent process.  The product features two pieces of cloth that are sewn
together forming a pad.  In between the two cloth layers is a trade secret
blend of safe ingredients (no pesticides) that attract dust mites. The
ingredients form a stripe that captures dust mites.  This internal strip is not sticky on the outside and has no discernible smell to humans, but dust
mites just love it, we named it “Mite Perfume”.  Each pad is effective for
90 days and can capture thousands upon thousands of dust mites.  After 90
days you just simply throw out the pads and replace with new pads.  In
some cases you can actually cut open the pads after 90 days to see dust mites
residues; it normally looks like a yellow muck.</p><p>Fight Mite capture pads are now part of a complete regiment to help control dust mites in your home.  With the use of our product, washing your bedding regularly in hot water and replacing your bedding with dust mite control pillow covers and mattress covers your are on you way helping your family feel better.</p>
<p>Now
we need your help to get our product out to millions of people who are
suffering with dust mite allergies. Many people don’t even know that dust mites are
causing their allergies.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We
launched our product Fight Mite in early 2014 after applying for a patent on
our product design.  We were able to get our product tested in clinical
lab studies to prove that the product worked and within three months of launch
we got an order from QVC.  In one study, one Fight Mite Capture Pad
successfully captured 10,671 dust mites from a sample of 30,000 in just one
week, our product works in your home for 90 days.</p>
<p>My
partners and I spent a lot of time and money developing the brand and now we
need your help to fund our national direct selling advertising program to put
Fight Mite on TV so millions of people can improve their quality of life.</p>
<p>We
have a great business plan in place that was developed by successful direct
selling consultants.  We have already developed a great production partner
and now we need funding for our advertising.</p>
<p>We
are seeking $45,000 to fund the first three months of advertising.  In our
business plan, our business becomes self supporting in three months helping
millions of people with their dust mite issues.  We will also be creating
brand awareness for our product that will help drive sales to QVC and our
future retail distributors and big box stores.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">All
sales profits from this funding project with go directly to the national direct
selling advertising program.</span></p>
<p>Please
note, that we do not claim to treat or cure any medical condition like
allergies and or asthma, however, we do understand that removing dust mites
from your home is a good thing for people that suffer from dust mite issues.</p>

<br/></div>","Dust Mites impact 1.2 Billion People World Wide
My
name is Arlen Bento Jr. and I am the Co Founder and Co Owner of Fight Mite
Global LLC.  In early 2014, dust mites became a problem in my home as my
youngest son was having issues with allergies and congestion, especially in the
morning.  I was telling my business partner about my son and he told me
that he thought it was dust mites.  My partner was familiar with dust
mites because he had severe dust mite allergies. So our quest to help my son
started the development of Fight Mite Capture Pads.
Dust
mites are spider-like microscopic insects found by the thousands in many parts
of a house, such as mattresses, upholstered furniture, linen closets, carpets,
pillows and stuffed animals. Dust mites spend their life cycle eating human
skin flakes and eliminating waste. 
According to the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), every home has significant levels of
dust mites. Dust
mites are one of the leading causes of indoor allergies and asthma according to
the American Lung Association (ALA).  Dust mite infestations are so
prevalent that the ALA says that four out of five homes have some level of
detectable dust mite allergen in at least one of the home's beds.
The Asthma and
Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) estimates that about 20 million Americans
have a confirmed allergy to dust mites. Symptoms of dust mite allergy include
sneezing, watery eyes and a runny nose, according to WebMD. Dust mite droppings
and the shedding of their exoskeletons produce a harmful allergen that can
cause an allergic reaction and asthma in many people, especially children, with
dust mite allergy, cautions the EPA.
In fact, the American College of
Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) cites dust mites as the most common
cause of childhood asthma, and a trigger for 90% of people with asthma. Signs
of asthma in people with dust mite allergies include difficulty breathing,
tightness in the chest and wheezing, according to the Mayo Clinic.
The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) lists dust mites as a major asthma trigger and advises
affected individuals to take steps to eliminate dust mites from their homes and
to limit their exposure to dust mite allergens. The presence of dust mites can
lead to chronic illness, so it is important for people to take steps to get rid
of dust mite infestations to maintain a healthy home environment.
Then
the idea hit me?  What if we just get the dust mites out of the bedding or
at least come up with simple, easy to use and effective way to help detect, control and remove the dust mite populations in the bedding?  The idea for Fight Mite was born.
My
background is in business, sales and product development.  I started to do
my research into dust mites and I found that there was no simple way to help
people with the symptoms caused by dust mite allergies.  I learned that my
family alternatives were new bedding with expensive plastic covers, removing
rugs/carpeting, getting rid of our dog (my son loves his dog) and allergy shots
(ouch).
So,
with my background in product development and help from my two partners in
import / export we were able to create our product.
We
developed a simple product that captures dust mites for 90 days and started our
patent process.  The product features two pieces of cloth that are sewn
together forming a pad.  In between the two cloth layers is a trade secret
blend of safe ingredients (no pesticides) that attract dust mites. The
ingredients form a stripe that captures dust mites.  This internal strip is not sticky on the outside and has no discernible smell to humans, but dust
mites just love it, we named it “Mite Perfume”.  Each pad is effective for
90 days and can capture thousands upon thousands of dust mites.  After 90
days you just simply throw out the pads and replace with new pads.  In
some cases you can actually cut open the pads after 90 days to see dust mites
residues; it normally looks like a yellow muck.Fight Mite capture pads are now part of a complete regiment to help control dust mites in your home.  With the use of our product, washing your bedding regularly in hot water and replacing your bedding with dust mite control pillow covers and mattress covers your are on you way helping your family feel better.
Now
we need your help to get our product out to millions of people who are
suffering with dust mite allergies. Many people don’t even know that dust mites are
causing their allergies.
What We Need & What You Get
We
launched our product Fight Mite in early 2014 after applying for a patent on
our product design.  We were able to get our product tested in clinical
lab studies to prove that the product worked and within three months of launch
we got an order from QVC.  In one study, one Fight Mite Capture Pad
successfully captured 10,671 dust mites from a sample of 30,000 in just one
week, our product works in your home for 90 days.
My
partners and I spent a lot of time and money developing the brand and now we
need your help to fund our national direct selling advertising program to put
Fight Mite on TV so millions of people can improve their quality of life.
We
have a great business plan in place that was developed by successful direct
selling consultants.  We have already developed a great production partner
and now we need funding for our advertising.
We
are seeking $45,000 to fund the first three months of advertising.  In our
business plan, our business becomes self supporting in three months helping
millions of people with their dust mite issues.  We will also be creating
brand awareness for our product that will help drive sales to QVC and our
future retail distributors and big box stores.  All
sales profits from this funding project with go directly to the national direct
selling advertising program.
Please
note, that we do not claim to treat or cure any medical condition like
allergies and or asthma, however, we do understand that removing dust mites
from your home is a good thing for people that suffer from dust mite issues.
The Impact
As
part of the building of our business we are passionate about helping
people. 
Fight
Mite has the potential to help impact millions of people that suffer with
allergies associated with Dust Mites.
My
two partners and I are dads, husbands and people just like you trying to help
others and build businesses to provide for our families.
We
have years of experience in product development, but Fight Mite can be our
crowning achievement with the ability to help millions of people. 
Risks & Challenges
Like
in all new ventures there is always a risk. As a group, my partners and I feel
that Fight Mite has the potential to help millions of people so if we can get
the word out to the consumers the risks are not as high as other products.
We
already have validated our product with QVC.  QVC is not an easy sell and
they are very diligent in their research taking on new products.
Our
business plan and concepts have all been validated by experts in consumer
products, direct selling and advertising.  All we need is your funding
help to get the product launched.

I have always had a love for plants and nature, and grew up exploring the Rocky Mountains learning to appreciate the natural world. I began learning about the power of herbal medicine in my twenties and began reading everything I could get my hands on in the matter. Finding my true passion and wanting to delve deeper, I began an apprenticeship with a local herbalist. I learned how to make remedies, and about local plants and their healing properties. Still finding myself lacking in the detailed knowledge I wanted; I returned to school and completed the renowned and extensive program of Bachelors in Herbal Sciences offered by Bastyr University just outside Seattle Washington. While the continuing joke among my friends is that I went to hogwarts, and some of my classes may have resembled herbology and potions; in reality my education was based in science and has allowed me to understand how best to extract different herbs, and which herbs and essential oils can best be used for different ailments. I continue to learn about different herbs, and new studies to keep up with current research.</p><p>While attending school I received an opportunity to create and sell healing salves at the local Harmony Massage and Boutique in Bothell, Washington.

</div></div>","Short SummaryHello! I'm Jackie, an herbalist in Colorado. I have always had a love for plants and nature, and grew up exploring the Rocky Mountains learning to appreciate the natural world. I began learning about the power of herbal medicine in my twenties and began reading everything I could get my hands on in the matter. Finding my true passion and wanting to delve deeper, I began an apprenticeship with a local herbalist. I learned how to make remedies, and about local plants and their healing properties. Still finding myself lacking in the detailed knowledge I wanted; I returned to school and completed the renowned and extensive program of Bachelors in Herbal Sciences offered by Bastyr University just outside Seattle Washington. While the continuing joke among my friends is that I went to hogwarts, and some of my classes may have resembled herbology and potions; in reality my education was based in science and has allowed me to understand how best to extract different herbs, and which herbs and essential oils can best be used for different ailments. I continue to learn about different herbs, and new studies to keep up with current research.While attending school I received an opportunity to create and sell healing salves at the local Harmony Massage and Boutique in Bothell, Washington. I had already discovered my passion for herbal medicine, but seemed here to find my niche. I now create several salves and lotions that can aide in helping to ease muscle and joint pain, eczema, sinus congestion, and acute injuries such as bruises, or cuts and scrapes.

</div><p><b>The Project Momentum Fitness Mission</b></p>
<p>My name is Amanda.   I am a
mom, wife, professor, &amp; life-long learner.  I am also a proud
individual with cerebral palsy whose health, work, and life have been
transformed by rehabilitative functional fitness training.  This training
has helped me shed pounds, leg braces, &amp; canes.  It has helped me
become stronger, healthier, &amp; more independent.  It has helped me
change my mindset &amp; my reality.  </p>
<ul>
<li><b>I want to do everything in my power to pay these
     blessings forward.  To use every tool in my toolbox to build the
     same opportunities for others. </b></li>
<li><b>I want to help other individuals with disabilities
     &amp; unique health conditions use fitness as a gateway for improved
     long-term health, healing, &amp; quality of life.</b></li>
<li><b>I want to make health &amp; fitness possible for
     everyone-- especially people often ignored or overlooked in the health
     &amp; fitness world.</b></li>
<li><b>I created the non-profit Project Momentum Fitness
     Inc. to provide extraordinary health and fitness support for
     individuals with exceptional needs. </b></li>
<li><b>The Project Momentum Fitness Team wants to help others
     pursue long-term health regardless of age, circumstance, ability, or
     disability.</b></li>
</ul><b></b><p><b>Our Story</b></p><p></p><p>Like most adults with disabilities I used my standard 4 physical
therapy visits per year, was as active as I had to be, &amp; accepted
the status quo of surviving the reality of my unhappy, painful, frustrating
physical world. My physical health was in shambles so my emotional health
was in crisis. My work suffered, my marriage suffered, my
parenting suffered, my relationships suffered. Two years ago that status quo changed.  I had already used my
allotted PT visits for the year so I stumbled into Crossfit77 in Mooresville, NC to
ask about a fitness membership. I asked for help.  Armored behind leg
braces &amp; canes I steeled myself for them to say NO because I was too
""risky,"" too ""broken,"" too ""disabled."" Instead,
they simply said, ""Let's get to work.""  And work we did.</p><p><span>Project
Momentum Fitness Inc began.  </span></p><ul>
<li><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>It began as my personal health &amp; fitness dream of walking
barefoot in the sand-- brace-free, cane-free, help-free to experience the world
through my children's eyes.  </b></p></li>
<li><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>It grew into an
individual health &amp; fitness idea sprawled out on the gym
floor relearning how to wiggle my toes by training my brain &amp; my
body to work together instead of against each other.  </b></p></li>
<li><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>It ignited into a joint health &amp; fitness mission to open closed

<h2><b>Who we are:</b></h2>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Chana Frazin, known locally
as 'the oil lady'. 
</p>
<p>We live in the Golan Heights with our 4
children, ages 2 1/2 – 10. 
</p>
<p>I stopped working outside the home after my second son
was born, I wanted to be home with my kids. After my fourth child was
born I felt it was time to do something other than the never-ending
laundry and food prep.  I found an amazing opportunity with doTERRA
oils, got started and <b>birthed a line of natural creams and remedies inspired by the
needs of our family</b>.  With 4 small children at home and 2 parents
with a lifetime  of allergies it was easy to find a thousand home uses for
the oils. We treated fevers,  coughs, colds, flu, allergies, itchy ears, asthma
and so much more. We were amazed and thrilled with the results!  
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458558229/phpntkd0h3groyxcvzxs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><h3>
<b>I will never forget</b> <br/>
</h3><p>the night my 3-1/2 year old daughter came into our room in the middle of the night, and crawled
into our bed burning up with fever. <b> </b>A few minutes later<b> </b>her baby
sister followed her, with her hot, limp  little body.  I applied our fever reducer oil to their little feet and got
up to wash my hands.  When I returned to our bed <b>a few minutes later</b>,
both girls were asleep and their bodies had already cooled down
dramatically. I couldn't believe it!  It was the first time we had
used the oils in this way. I woke my husband up to make sure I wasn't
creating the result I wanted in my head. He woke up, felt their
bodies and <b>confirmed, in amazement</b>, that they both were in fact much
cooler already. 
</p>
<p>From that moment on we have treated all
the ailments in our home with the oils and developed a line of
natural healing products for people to easily use in their homes. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458557161/msmhoxh31youtfd0qanr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

My name is Chana Frazin, known locally
as 'the oil lady'. 

We live in the Golan Heights with our 4
children, ages 2 1/2 – 10. 

I stopped working outside the home after my second son
was born, I wanted to be home with my kids. After my fourth child was
born I felt it was time to do something other than the never-ending
laundry and food prep.  I found an amazing opportunity with doTERRA
oils, got started and birthed a line of natural creams and remedies inspired by the
needs of our family.  With 4 small children at home and 2 parents
with a lifetime  of allergies it was easy to find a thousand home uses for
the oils. We treated fevers,  coughs, colds, flu, allergies, itchy ears, asthma
and so much more. We were amazed and thrilled with the results!  



I will never forget 
the night my 3-1/2 year old daughter came into our room in the middle of the night, and crawled
into our bed burning up with fever.  A few minutes later her baby
sister followed her, with her hot, limp  little body.  I applied our fever reducer oil to their little feet and got
up to wash my hands.  When I returned to our bed a few minutes later,
both girls were asleep and their bodies had already cooled down
dramatically. I couldn't believe it!  It was the first time we had
used the oils in this way. I woke my husband up to make sure I wasn't
creating the result I wanted in my head. He woke up, felt their
bodies and confirmed, in amazement, that they both were in fact much
cooler already. 

From that moment on we have treated all
the ailments in our home with the oils and developed a line of
natural healing products for people to easily use in their homes. 

We are ready to move our home business
forward to the next level. 

To us that means an online store and
web presence. We are running this campaign to help pay for the graphic artist, photographer, translator, web host, etc. Once we have this we can reach markets
all over the world and go way beyond our current, mostly word of mouth
approach.  Although we are thrilled to have satisfied costumers continue to spread the good word about us!
