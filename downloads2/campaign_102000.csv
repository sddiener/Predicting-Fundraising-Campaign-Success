When programming your bots, you’re designing how they will behave within a room, and you move bots into rooms using squad waypoints. Essentially you are assigning a squad of bots a room waypoint and programming how they will behave against enemies once they’re in that room.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/MdXxzQeL9Q61YEqnFd/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:695px;""/></p><p> </p><p>The room based gameplay also plays into how you progress throughout a game. Within each room, there can be points of interest called Stations. These Stations can provide a variety of benefits like Auto-Turrets or Teleporter nodes and also include the primary objectives of the game. In order to gain control of a Station, you need to gain control of the room it’s located in. Room control is gained by clearing out the room of enemies and having at least one of your units in the room. This is a two-way street though, as the aliens can retake rooms through the same rules.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/XdPy9G6nGTJrn9qspQ/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:695px;""/></p><p> </p><p>Throughout a game, you will have a bar at the top of your screen representing the ship’s generator integrity.

The Behavior System is how you program your bot's actions in Bot Net: Ramshackle Robotics. When creating your bots, or at anytime during your turn, you will be able to give your bots 3 types of commands.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/J481OQgb8KIybnFpKx/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:695px;""/></p><p> </p><p>The first command type is what we call a Movement Command. This describes how you would like to move in relation to a target. This could be as simple as our ‘Move To’ command, which means to move directly towards your target, or something as complex as our ‘Spread Out’ command, which will prioritize moving to the best spot within range of your target that has the least amount of friendly units nearby.</p><p>The second command type is what we call an Action Command. This command type describes when, or if, you would like to use the bot’s equipment on your turn. Examples of this would be the ‘Run And Gun’ Action Command, which has your bot always perform it’s movement before using it’s equipment, or the ‘Assault’ Action Command, which has your bot only move if it couldn’t use it’s equipment from it’s current position.</p><p>The third command type is what we call a Target Command. This command type describes how to prioritize the available targets in a room. The Target Command ‘Pristine Enemies’ will prioritize enemies with the most current health, whereas the Target Command ‘Injured Enemies’ will prioritize in the opposite order; prioritizing enemies with the lowest current health.</p><p>When you combine one command from each of these categories, you get a full behaviour. A unit with the commands ‘Move To’, ‘Run And Gun’, ‘Pristine Enemies’, will first move towards the enemy in range with the highest current health and then attack with it’s equipment. In contrast, a unit with the commands ‘Spread Out’, ‘Assault’, ‘Injured Enemies’, will first try to attack from it’s current position, and if there are no valid targets, will move to a spot in the room in range of the enemy with the lowest current health that has the least number of friendly units nearby.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/KyMpnLPSn5aHHs0DBO/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""width:695px;""/></p><p> </p><p>What kind of Behavior you decide to give your bot will usually depend on what kind of bot you've made.

Which bot type you choose will depend on what kind of strategy you're going for. Need a tank bot that will soak up lots of damage? The Tough Bot will be great for that job! Need to get your bot somewhere quickly? The Fast Bot is an excellent choice for that job! In the full game, there will be a large variety of bots from a number of rarities to choose from for several kinds of situations, including, but not limited to, the following:</p><ul>
<li>Janitor Bot: Standard issue janitor robot. Moderate stats across the board.</li>
<li>Maintenance Bot: Has a really nice and fancy wrench, recovers health each turn.</li>
<li>Tough Bot: Outfitted with armor plating, has improved health.</li>
<li>Fast Bot: Equipped with a rocket pack and roller skates, has improved movement.</li>
<li>Handy Bot: Built with an additional arm, can hold a second item.</li>
<li>Observant Bot: Has binoculars for eyes, has improved range with equipment.</li>
<li>Careful Bot: Coated with a layer of bubble wrap, has a chance to save an item on use.</li>
<li>Teleporter Bot: Has a teleporter beacon on it's back, can be used as an end node for your teleporters.</li>

You'll want to make sure you pair your bots with equipment that suits their abilities. Like bot types, there will be a large variety of equipment available, including the following:</p><ul>
<li>Welding Torch: Normally used for welding sheets of metal together, the Welding Torch is a simple but effective weapon.</li>
<li>Rivet Gun: A nail gun type tool normally used in construction. It fires bolts of heated spikes, used to bind metal sheets. It's not built for combat, but certainly capable of it!</li>
<li>Pulse Repeater: A powerful ranged weapon, the F-103 Pulse Repeater is the standard issue assault rifle for Marines of the Human Worlds Alliance.</li>
<li>Scatter Array: An extremely deadly shotgun-like weapon. The X-12 Scatter Array is your best friend in a tight spot.</li>
<li>Focus Beam: The L-42 Focus Beam is a devastating ranged weapon used by the HWA special forces. It fires an accelerating particle beam that inflicts large damage the further away the target is.</li>
<li>Solar Flare: The RA-23 Antimaterial Cannon (nicknamed the 'Solar Flare') is a prototype weapon that fires a fusion blast, destroying everything in it's path. Requires SPF 5,000 sunscreen to use safely.</li>
<li>Arc Conduit: Cobbled together from various electrical equipment, the Arc Conduit fires a laser that ionizes the air around it creating bolts of electricity that arc to everything nearby.</li>
<li>Concussion Cannon: The Protocorp Crowd Dispersal Tool, less formally known as the Concussion Cannon, is a tool often used during civil unrest. It fires a large shockwave, knocking back anything in it's way.</li>
<li>Containment Rifle: Developed by Protocorp's 'Civilian Friendly' weapons branch, the Containment Rifle fires a stream of thick foam that holds anything it touches in place.</li>

Items provide single use effects that are generally activated manually by the player. These will often provide a rather powerful effect at a an efficient cost. Some examples of Items that will be available are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>Repair Kit: A simple bot repair kit, will heal your bot on use.</li>
<li>Battery Pack: A portable battery pack, will recharge and overcharge your bot on use.</li>
<li>Backup Core: A spare bot power core, is automatically consumed on bot death, preventing death and healing the bot.</li>
<li>Portable Turret: A miniature auto-turret that can be placed on the ground to defend an area.</li>
<li>Shield Generator: When used, creates a temporary, stationary, energy shield that can only be fired through from the inside.</li>
<li>Landmine: A remotely activated landmine. Place it on the ground in a choke-point and activate it when the enemies are least expecting!</li>
<li>Active Camouflage: Can be use to render the user completely invisible for a short duration</li>
<li>Teleportation Grenade: A portable teleporter node that can be thrown at a target to instantly teleport it to a controlled teleporter.</li>

So far this project has been funded entirely through investment from our friends and family, as well as personal investments. We plan to complete Bot Net: Ramshackle Robotics whether this crowdfunding campaign succeeds or not, with the difference being how long it will take for us to complete the game. This is the reason behind us choosing a flexible goal for the campaign. Because of this, every pledge to the campaign helps us bring the game to you sooner than later!</p><p>Our crowdfunding goal for Bot Net: Ramshackle Robotics is $42500 CAD. This goal was chosen as the minimum amount of funding we would need to be able to work full time on the game so we can deliver it by this fall. The breakdown of what this money will be going towards is as follows:</p><p><strong>Indiegogo Fees:</strong> <i>$2125 CAD.</i> This is for Indiegogo's cut of the campaign.</p><p><strong>Art and Sound Assets: </strong><i>$15000 CAD. </i>This budget will allow us to continue paying our freelance artist and composer for the fantastic quality assets they've created so far. What's available in the demo is only a small taste of what's to come!</p><p><strong>Supplementing Cost of Living:</strong> <i>$10000</i> CAD. This budget is what's needed to be able to work full time on the game from now until launch. For two people, we live on a pretty small budget of $2500 CAD per month.  Overall it will cost us around $25000 CAD from now until launch in living expenses. We have the rest of this budget already figured out, but will need the additional funds from the campaign to cover this cost.</p><p><strong>Equipment and Software:</strong> <i>$2000 CAD.</i> This budget will be going toward any software fees, along with equipment needed to develop and bring the game to other platforms.</p><p><strong>Localization:</strong> <i>$2500 CAD</i><i>.</i> This will be our initial budget for localizing the game to a second language.</p><p><strong>Marketing:</strong><i> $10875 CAD.</i> The remainder of the budget will be going towards marketing costs.

Some examples of extra features we'd be interested in are:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Challenge Mode:</strong> The challenge mode would be a special kind of game where a pre-existing board state would already be setup for you and your goal would be to figure out how to win the game in a limited amount of time. This could come paired with it's own achievements and unlocks.</li>
<li>
<strong>Theater:</strong> The theater would be a feature where you could playback game replays and share them with your friends. We plan on building this feature to be quite robust and have it allow you to stop the replay at any moment, move the camera around, and click on things in the game to check additional info.</li>
<li>
<strong>Level Editor: </strong>Pretty straight forward, this would be a tool for making your own levels for the game. We would ideally pair this with the ability to share your levels with your friends.</li>
<li>
<strong>Multiplayer:</strong> We've played around with the idea of multiplayer games.

Inspired by the idea of bringing the fun of programming to a video game, the Behavior System offers you a simplified way to program and automate your bot's behaviours by mixing and matching 3 types of commands. The Behavior System offers tons of unique complexity in an easy to use, simple package!  Build and upgrade your robot army with specialized bot upgrades, weapons, and items! By combining different bots with different kinds of gear, you can create powerful combinations! Want to use the Focus Beam, a weapon that deals more damage the further it is from it's target, to it's maximum potential? Give it to a Fast Bot with the Keep At Range command. Now you have a powerful bot who can quickly move far away to deal a bunch of damage!     Every playthrough is different, with random bots, equipment, and behavior unlocks! Discover AI Cores throughout your game and unlock powerful commands, bots, equipment, and items! If you're lucky, you may even find some ultra-rare 'Hax'!  Turn the tides of battle by gaining control of Stations; key locations that provide powerful bonuses and large scale effects! Make sure to capture all the Stations you can, as they provide a variety of effects like deadly Auto-Turrets, Teleporters, and 3D Printers for building more bots!     All of the aliens use the same Behavior and Squad System as you! Outsmart your enemies by learning and exploiting their behaviors!     Explore randomly generated ships with unique layouts and loot to find!  Discover legendary robots that bring powerful and unique abilities!  Play through the Campaign Mode, which has you progress through multiple stages to defeat the invaders!  Overcome a variety of 'Curve Balls' and 'Finales'; boss-like encounters that are a true test of your strategy skills!        Bot Net: Ramshackle Robotics takes place part way into an interstellar war between the Human Worlds Alliance (HWA) and a shadowy conglomerate of alien species called The Galactic Legion (The Legion for short). The Legion has conquered many species and forced them to fight in their armies, so in the full game you will run into many kinds of aliens.  You play as an IT guy aboard a human spaceship that has been defeated by The Legion. The ship is dead in the water, alien soldiers have boarded and have killed everyone they could find. You are locked in your office with a few janitor bots and a 3d printer you can use to build stuff with. You can't fight, but you can program these robots to fight for you. So, you start 3d printing as many as you can, send them out into the ship to gather supplies, and fight to take the ship back. If you can get control of the ship’s generators and the bridge, you just might be able to warp jump to safety...     In a typical game, you will be building and outfitting a whole bunch of robots, programming their behaviors using Bot Net’s unique Behavior System, and sending them off to explore and recapture control of the ship.The game is based in a grid of grids; the ship is divided into a grid of rooms and each room has its own grid of floor tiles. When programming your bots, you’re designing how they will behave within a room, and you move bots into rooms using squad waypoints. Essentially you are assigning a squad of bots a room waypoint and programming how they will behave against enemies once they’re in that room.  The room based gameplay also plays into how you progress throughout a game. Within each room, there can be points of interest called Stations. These Stations can provide a variety of benefits like Auto-Turrets or Teleporter nodes and also include the primary objectives of the game. In order to gain control of a Station, you need to gain control of the room it’s located in. Room control is gained by clearing out the room of enemies and having at least one of your units in the room. This is a two-way street though, as the aliens can retake rooms through the same rules. Throughout a game, you will have a bar at the top of your screen representing the ship’s generator integrity. This bar will deplete each turn that the enemies control the ship’s generator objectives. But, if you retake a generator, your generator integrity will start to repair itself. If the generator integrity reaches zero, you lose the game. In order to win a game, you must gain control of all the generators and the control room.  On your way to achieving the main objectives, you'll run into what we call 'Curve Balls'. These are randomized events that mix up the gameplay by throwing tough challenges or secondary objectives at you. Curve Balls can take the form of a variety of things, such as a group of tougher and smarter elite enemies or a fire that's spreading throughout the ship that needs to be dealt with.  When you're nearing the end of a game, you'll encounter a 'Finale'. Finales are similar to the Curve Balls only much bigger and more challenging. These essentially act as a final boss for a game. Like the Curve Balls, they can also take the form of a variety of things, not necessarily a typical boss fight but not exclusive to that either. Finales will be the ultimate test of your skills, where only the best of the best will succeed!  In order to deal with all these challenges, you're going to need to master the Behavior System. The Behavior System is how you program your bot's actions in Bot Net: Ramshackle Robotics. When creating your bots, or at anytime during your turn, you will be able to give your bots 3 types of commands.  The first command type is what we call a Movement Command. This describes how you would like to move in relation to a target. This could be as simple as our ‘Move To’ command, which means to move directly towards your target, or something as complex as our ‘Spread Out’ command, which will prioritize moving to the best spot within range of your target that has the least amount of friendly units nearby.The second command type is what we call an Action Command. This command type describes when, or if, you would like to use the bot’s equipment on your turn. Examples of this would be the ‘Run And Gun’ Action Command, which has your bot always perform it’s movement before using it’s equipment, or the ‘Assault’ Action Command, which has your bot only move if it couldn’t use it’s equipment from it’s current position.The third command type is what we call a Target Command. This command type describes how to prioritize the available targets in a room. The Target Command ‘Pristine Enemies’ will prioritize enemies with the most current health, whereas the Target Command ‘Injured Enemies’ will prioritize in the opposite order; prioritizing enemies with the lowest current health.When you combine one command from each of these categories, you get a full behaviour. A unit with the commands ‘Move To’, ‘Run And Gun’, ‘Pristine Enemies’, will first move towards the enemy in range with the highest current health and then attack with it’s equipment. In contrast, a unit with the commands ‘Spread Out’, ‘Assault’, ‘Injured Enemies’, will first try to attack from it’s current position, and if there are no valid targets, will move to a spot in the room in range of the enemy with the lowest current health that has the least number of friendly units nearby.  What kind of Behavior you decide to give your bot will usually depend on what kind of bot you've made. When making a bot, you get to decide it's bot type, equipment, and optionally an item.  A bot's type affects what the bot's base stats are. Which bot type you choose will depend on what kind of strategy you're going for. Need a tank bot that will soak up lots of damage? The Tough Bot will be great for that job! Need to get your bot somewhere quickly? The Fast Bot is an excellent choice for that job! In the full game, there will be a large variety of bots from a number of rarities to choose from for several kinds of situations, including, but not limited to, the following:
Janitor Bot: Standard issue janitor robot. Moderate stats across the board.
Maintenance Bot: Has a really nice and fancy wrench, recovers health each turn.
Tough Bot: Outfitted with armor plating, has improved health.
Fast Bot: Equipped with a rocket pack and roller skates, has improved movement.
Handy Bot: Built with an additional arm, can hold a second item.
Observant Bot: Has binoculars for eyes, has improved range with equipment.
Careful Bot: Coated with a layer of bubble wrap, has a chance to save an item on use.
Teleporter Bot: Has a teleporter beacon on it's back, can be used as an end node for your teleporters.
  A bot's equipment is what they will be using to fight the aliens. You'll want to make sure you pair your bots with equipment that suits their abilities. Like bot types, there will be a large variety of equipment available, including the following:
Welding Torch: Normally used for welding sheets of metal together, the Welding Torch is a simple but effective weapon.
Rivet Gun: A nail gun type tool normally used in construction. It fires bolts of heated spikes, used to bind metal sheets. It's not built for combat, but certainly capable of it!
Pulse Repeater: A powerful ranged weapon, the F-103 Pulse Repeater is the standard issue assault rifle for Marines of the Human Worlds Alliance.
Scatter Array: An extremely deadly shotgun-like weapon. The X-12 Scatter Array is your best friend in a tight spot.
Focus Beam: The L-42 Focus Beam is a devastating ranged weapon used by the HWA special forces. It fires an accelerating particle beam that inflicts large damage the further away the target is.
Solar Flare: The RA-23 Antimaterial Cannon (nicknamed the 'Solar Flare') is a prototype weapon that fires a fusion blast, destroying everything in it's path. Requires SPF 5,000 sunscreen to use safely.
Arc Conduit: Cobbled together from various electrical equipment, the Arc Conduit fires a laser that ionizes the air around it creating bolts of electricity that arc to everything nearby.
Concussion Cannon: The Protocorp Crowd Dispersal Tool, less formally known as the Concussion Cannon, is a tool often used during civil unrest. It fires a large shockwave, knocking back anything in it's way.
Containment Rifle: Developed by Protocorp's 'Civilian Friendly' weapons branch, the Containment Rifle fires a stream of thick foam that holds anything it touches in place.
  Optionally, you can choose to equip your bot with an Item. Items provide single use effects that are generally activated manually by the player. These will often provide a rather powerful effect at a an efficient cost. Some examples of Items that will be available are as follows:
Repair Kit: A simple bot repair kit, will heal your bot on use.
Battery Pack: A portable battery pack, will recharge and overcharge your bot on use.
Backup Core: A spare bot power core, is automatically consumed on bot death, preventing death and healing the bot.
Portable Turret: A miniature auto-turret that can be placed on the ground to defend an area.
Shield Generator: When used, creates a temporary, stationary, energy shield that can only be fired through from the inside.
Landmine: A remotely activated landmine. Place it on the ground in a choke-point and activate it when the enemies are least expecting!
Active Camouflage: Can be use to render the user completely invisible for a short duration
Teleportation Grenade: A portable teleporter node that can be thrown at a target to instantly teleport it to a controlled teleporter.
  Now that you know how to make your bots, you'll need to know a bit about the enemies you're going up against! All of the enemies in Bot Net: Ramshackle Robotics use the same Behavior System that you do.  Understanding your enemy's tactics is critical to your success. We have a good variety of enemies planned for the game, including the following:        The Swarm is a insect race that is too dangerous to be controlled, even by the Galactic Legion. The Galactic Legion will keep Larval Matriarchs (The infant form of a Swarm Queen) frozen on ice, only to be deployed as a biological weapon of mass destruction in emergency situations. Once released The Swarm will consume everything in it's wake. In order to contain the inevitable chaos that unleashing The Swarm causes, The Galactic Legion has genetically modified the DNA of The Swarm in a way that will cause all of it's members to expire after a certain period of time.          Bot Net: Ramshackle Robotics will be available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux on Steam. We also have plans to broaden our list of platforms in the future!    To start, Bot Net; Ramshackle Robotics will be available in English. We plan to bring it to as many languages as possible before and after release though! We'll be prioritizing each language based on the demand we have for that translation, so please let us know what languages you'd like us to translate to!        CaffeineWare is owned and run by both Brea Parker and Nic Gardner. So far this project has been funded entirely through investment from our friends and family, as well as personal investments. We plan to complete Bot Net: Ramshackle Robotics whether this crowdfunding campaign succeeds or not, with the difference being how long it will take for us to complete the game. This is the reason behind us choosing a flexible goal for the campaign. Because of this, every pledge to the campaign helps us bring the game to you sooner than later!Our crowdfunding goal for Bot Net: Ramshackle Robotics is $42500 CAD. This goal was chosen as the minimum amount of funding we would need to be able to work full time on the game so we can deliver it by this fall. The breakdown of what this money will be going towards is as follows:Indiegogo Fees: $2125 CAD. This is for Indiegogo's cut of the campaign.Art and Sound Assets: $15000 CAD. This budget will allow us to continue paying our freelance artist and composer for the fantastic quality assets they've created so far. What's available in the demo is only a small taste of what's to come!Supplementing Cost of Living: $10000 CAD. This budget is what's needed to be able to work full time on the game from now until launch. For two people, we live on a pretty small budget of $2500 CAD per month.  Overall it will cost us around $25000 CAD from now until launch in living expenses. We have the rest of this budget already figured out, but will need the additional funds from the campaign to cover this cost.Equipment and Software: $2000 CAD. This budget will be going toward any software fees, along with equipment needed to develop and bring the game to other platforms.Localization: $2500 CAD. This will be our initial budget for localizing the game to a second language.Marketing: $10875 CAD. The remainder of the budget will be going towards marketing costs. This includes payments to our marketing team and an advertisement budget.    In the case that our crowdfunding goes even better than hoped for, we've planned out some exciting stretch goals for you! $60000 CAD:  Additional Content and LocalizationIf we make it to $60000 CAD, we'll use that extra budget to design and develop more of the regular content (Enemies, Bots, Weapons, etc.) along with some of our secondary feature ideas and additional localization to requested languages. Some examples of extra features we'd be interested in are:

Challenge Mode: The challenge mode would be a special kind of game where a pre-existing board state would already be setup for you and your goal would be to figure out how to win the game in a limited amount of time. This could come paired with it's own achievements and unlocks.

Theater: The theater would be a feature where you could playback game replays and share them with your friends. We plan on building this feature to be quite robust and have it allow you to stop the replay at any moment, move the camera around, and click on things in the game to check additional info.

Level Editor: Pretty straight forward, this would be a tool for making your own levels for the game. We would ideally pair this with the ability to share your levels with your friends.

Multiplayer: We've played around with the idea of multiplayer games. This could work in the way of each player building bots to fight each other or, another idea being, one player gets to act as the aliens and on the bots. We think there's some interesting potential for multiplayer so we'll think a lot more about this idea should we reach this goal.
This list could also include possible ideas the community has and is interested in as well. If we reach this goal, we'll evaluate how many and which features we could work on and let the community decide which option is the favorite. $100000 CAD: Free DLC for All BackersThis would be phenomenal if we were able to raise this much! In the event that this somehow happens, we plan to develop an expansion for the game which would include any extra features we weren't able to get into the base game, along with a bunch of additional regular content, and a new campaign mode. We'll also make this expansion free for everyone who helped us reach this goal! We'd also take this opportunity to bring additional localization and work on bringing the game to consoles.  This campaign is promoted by IndieBros - ""Helping Indie developers do what they do best!""",46.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hyperventila is a narrative-driven open world RPG set in the Hyperventila galaxy. A world of disreputable space bars, rogue traders and totalitarian space empires.
Fans of the classic 70s and 80s era of science fiction films would find themselves right at home in this universe. Jump in your spacecraft and immerse yourself among the stars.
Hyperventila will become playable on Steam and other online retailers, January 2021.
 
              
 
Mechanics
Faction dynamics allow you to manipulate and influence factions to shift the source of power in the galaxy.
You can talk to NPCs and will be given several dialogue options to steer the conversation.
You are able to interact with items, bring items onboard your ship and transport them to any destination.
Use your personal scanner to get more information from your surroundings.

 
You can customize your load-out by equipping items at your personal ship station, and equip ship attachments at the shipyard.
Use your hyperdrive to jump from one solar system to another. 
In order to enter stations and other ships in space, you will have to manually dock your ship.
You can navigate the Galaxy using your NAV-CON, there you can select destinations, scan stellar objects and track other ships.

 
Doors inside your ship can be controlled from your interior ship console on the bridge. Doors and consoles that do not belong to you can also be hacked if you have a hacking PDA.

 
You can receive messages from anywhere in the galaxy using the GAL-COM system and hail ships using your DIR-COM at your ship command station.

 
The Galaxy
The Hyperventila Galaxy is a place rich with the potential for adventure. Even with the technology to jump almost anywhere in the galaxy, it remains largely unexplored.
From the dark outer rim to the inner turbulent regions of The Vex, the Hyperventila galaxy is the place to go for a determined space captain.



 
 
 



   

Playable Species
You will be able to select from a large variety of humanoid species when starting the game.
Each with their own skills, traits and characteristics.
They could be the adventurous human Landers...
...the noble Echron...
...or the small but fierce Praat.
 




The Factions
Each corner of the galaxy has been claimed by a specific faction. Be it the proud Cespians or the free pirates or the entitled Coalition... when in their space your relationship with this faction better be in good standing.
 


 
 
Galactic Coalition


                                                     
 

 
This faction considers itself the only legitimate government of the galaxy and does not recognize the autonomy of the pirate alliance (FPA).
 





 
 
Free Pirate Alliance


                                                                                                                  
 

 
Comprised of what were previously smaller groups of traders and brigands, the free pirate alliance was created to put an end to the extreme levels of lawlessness that existed in the part of the galaxy known as “The Vex”. 
 





 
 
Cespian Space Empire


                                                                                      
 

 
A powerful authoritarian space empire that controls a quarter of the galaxy. An autonomous government in the galaxy that retains their imperial and social traditions from the past.
 





 
 
The Echron Collective


                                                                                                            
 

 
A secluded authoritarian institution that isn’t welcoming to outsiders. It became autonomous after the collapse of the first galactic government but still has a representative in the galactic coalition chamber.

Where does the money go?
I want you to feel assured that every penny of the campaign will be spent on Hyperventila, to build and grow the game.
Some of the biggest challenges in these uncertain times is the cost of living. The money will support the developer until the game comes out and the rest will go towards promotion.
Another big challenge these days is simply getting noticed and therefore I have allocated a chunk of the campaign income to promotion and marketing.
On top of that there are various taxes and fees that come into play, both from this website and the various countries where payments need to be processed.

 
If not all the goals are reached, the funds will still go towards development but some features may need to be cut in the future, the promotional budget may also be smaller.
All backers that pledged will get what they were promised in their packages.

In the game, as in the actual world, lives come to crossroads and follow directions depending on the choices, big or small, that we make.The world, characters and their stories evolve and branch many times before coming to one of the nine possible endings in the digital game. But the story doen't end there. You can continue playing the tabletop version until the last day of human kind!The narrative of Dimday Red could be seen as a metaphor for human existence. As each of us go through our lives, conscious of our impending mortality, the world in DDR must face its inevitable collision with the Sun and decide how to live the last years of humanity.What would you do if the world ended in 52 years?The Earth's orbit has been perturbed, causing the planet to slowly move closer and closer towards the sun for the past 47 of years. As a result, its axis has tilted and its rotation around itself has slowed, making days last longer and in some places night never comes anymore. The phenomenon was originally named Terrestrial Orbit Lapse, but is widely called the Lapse.Scientists estimate it will take around 52 years for the Earth to come so close to the sun that life will be no longer sustainable.Because of Earth’s new position, some places have already been deemed inhabitable. Most of the northern hemisphere is under constant heat. All major cities in the United States, European Union, Republic of China and Russia are mostly lifeless concrete deserts.Everything has changed on the Fireball, as Earth came to be called after the Lapse. The structure of human society is on the bring of collapse. The only ones keeping some kind of order are powerful corporations that battle for authority and influence until the end. They control the army and the police and have created authoritarian regimes in most developed cities. Democracy is a concept of times past, dismantled for the “benefit of the people”.The immense heat has created enormous waves of environmental refuges that try to reach safety. Former super power counties have annexed their southern neighbors, sometimes peacefully but on most occasions not. People on the Fireball, would be normal dysfunctional human beings, like all of us, but they are not. Most of them have been born after the Lapse and all they have known is an authoritarian society that stubbornly fights for survival, in a world that knows it won't survive. Some of them choose chaos, some choose order and some follow their hearts.One thing is certain. No one is equal under the sun anymore. CastesAfter the initial chaos subsided, a new kind of social order has developed. It consists of the following classes:

Subhumans - Beings living outside society, with no rules or humanity left.

Dirt - The lowest level of citizens in organized society. Most of them work for the black markets and commodity factories. They are not part of the Corporate Rule.

Red Collar - Middle-class workers, the basic workforce for the corporation ecosystem.

Black Collar - Management personnel in the corporation ecosystem.

Luminaries - They are the corporation bosses. The Luminaries comprise eight families based around the world.

Pax Deorum - It is composed of three people no one actually knows. There is speculation that its members are heads of the Luminaries, but the families deny that. 
 MutationsDue to continuous exposure to the sun, many of the children born after the Lapse develop cancer related mutations, sometimes powerful, but always deadly.

Marble Eyes - They have developed heat vision, being capable of seeing at night and behind objects. They see a merge of normal and heat sensitive images buy they can’t recognize colors any more. 

Hard Skins - Because of overexposure, a type of cancer has covered their skin, deeming it very hard, almost impenetrable.

Controllers - Children born after the Lapse. It is still undefined what causes their abilities. They were sought early by Corporations and were mainly working for them.

Zealots - The have developed a brain tumor that impacts their memory and cognitive abilities. They have a 9 minute memory span.

Aqualungs - Because of continuous use underwater, their lungs keep swelling, making them able to hold their breath for over 30 minutes. 
  ​You can play Dimday Red in your PC or Mac. You play as Eric, the marble-eyed hitman, whose goal is to find your place in this ever warmer world. The game is story driven, and your choices, represented as cards, will make a enormous impact on its outcome. Like real life, Eric's choices won't always lead to the results he would hope for, so the unraveling of the story becomes unexpected and mysterious. The world of Dimday Red is not a friendly place and danger lurks in his every move.  ​ To make your decisions on key points of the story, you will use Choice Cards, which will be available depending on your character's attribute stats. Your choices will impact the story, but also Eric's psyche and physique, and they will mark his future abilities. You will also have to choose how Eric converses with other characters. Most of the times, this won't have a dramatic effect on the story, but it will affect his stats and as a result his future interactions. As you progress, you will build your character's attributes, and they will determine how he will interact with other characters and situations. If you find the world of Dimday Red intriguing, you can continue the story with the Tabletop Role Playing Game. It contains 1 Rule Book, 1 Campaign, 1 Deck with 84 cards, and 1 set of Dice. Take your story telling to the next level while the world burns around you! Two to six can play.  The game deck is made by Character, Choice, and Ending cards. In addition, 7 Deadly Sins and 7 Heavenly Virtues cards are used to affect the character's attributes. All cards are mat laminated,  Sins and Virtues cards are also gold printed.The game deck is common for both the digital and physical game and consists of the following cards: Dimday Red is created to provide a unique storytelling experience. It is not supposed to be just another game, and although choice based games have been around for a while, the choices you make in DDR, won't always deliver what you expect.DDR's goal is to emerge the player into its world and let them feel how it is to live in the last days of the world!

<p><b>What is Derelict, the game?</b></p>
<p>Derelict is a squad-based real-time strategy game, requiring a sophisticated mobile defence strategy for objective success. The objective of the game is to get your soldiers from one side of the derelict space-ship to the other, moving from one airlock to the next. There you rest, refuel, reload and prepare to meet your opponents in the next level.</p>
<p>The ship in question is the Wing of Icarus. It was exploring uncharted space and has been infested with the Dross. Dross are like a mutated ant/spider creatures and are fearless, deadly and relentless. The walls of the ship are now covered in biomass, and with spores that come up from the floor and spawn the Dross. They are invasive and can quickly saturate all areas the ship, thriving in this dark environment and quickly converting the ship into their hive.</p>
<p>You are the commanding officer of the squad of elite space soldiers, in charge of repatriating the ship and eliminating the Dross infestation. Your squad must fight hard and fast through the Dross defences and clear the way for re-enforcements. Will a direct forward offensive be successful? Or is it better to hunker down in a strongly-defended location and let the Dross come to you? Or perhaps you can find a safe route to take your squad through with minimal opposition? You must evaluate a changing situation and adapt quickly, because you enemy certain will!</p>
<p>Play the role of the Commander. Reclaim the Derelict. Rescue survivors. Eradicate the Dross.</p>
<p>Derelict is much, much more than a point and click game. It has real time gameplay and constant action. Your opponent continually adapts to the situation and you must, too.</p>
<p>Derelict plays similar to the moving across maps to safe houses in Left4Dead. The atmosphere is similar the movie Alien 2. The game plays with a desktop tower defence and an item system like The Last of Us. x5! Our ecology of the environment and the infesting aliens is realistic and believable, and is designed for the player to fully engage with the game.</p>

<p>The primary risks we face are all associated with the addition of extended and completely new features introduced by our stretch goals.

To help minimize this risk, a new technical design encompassing all new and old features will be created to map out how all the parts of the game work and interact together.

No shortcuts and no compromises. We are almost finished, and ask for your help.
Derelict: behind the scenes
What is Derelict, the game?
Derelict is a squad-based real-time strategy game, requiring a sophisticated mobile defence strategy for objective success. The objective of the game is to get your soldiers from one side of the derelict space-ship to the other, moving from one airlock to the next. There you rest, refuel, reload and prepare to meet your opponents in the next level.
The ship in question is the Wing of Icarus. It was exploring uncharted space and has been infested with the Dross. Dross are like a mutated ant/spider creatures and are fearless, deadly and relentless. The walls of the ship are now covered in biomass, and with spores that come up from the floor and spawn the Dross. They are invasive and can quickly saturate all areas the ship, thriving in this dark environment and quickly converting the ship into their hive.
You are the commanding officer of the squad of elite space soldiers, in charge of repatriating the ship and eliminating the Dross infestation. Your squad must fight hard and fast through the Dross defences and clear the way for re-enforcements. Will a direct forward offensive be successful? Or is it better to hunker down in a strongly-defended location and let the Dross come to you? Or perhaps you can find a safe route to take your squad through with minimal opposition? You must evaluate a changing situation and adapt quickly, because you enemy certain will!
Play the role of the Commander. Reclaim the Derelict. Rescue survivors. Eradicate the Dross.
Derelict is much, much more than a point and click game. It has real time gameplay and constant action. Your opponent continually adapts to the situation and you must, too.
Derelict plays similar to the moving across maps to safe houses in Left4Dead. The atmosphere is similar the movie Alien 2. The game plays with a desktop tower defence and an item system like The Last of Us. x5! Our ecology of the environment and the infesting aliens is realistic and believable, and is designed for the player to fully engage with the game.


What do backers get?



What if we surpass our goal?


Who are the main characters?
Dross. These alien creatures once inhabited the planet and now they are taking over the spaceship. Biomass and spores are growing at a tremendous rate, constantly spawning more and more Dross. These bugs consume anything and convert it into more biomass to spawn more Dross.


Soldiers. An squad of elite mercenaries are hired to reclaim the Derelict spaceship.
Commander. You are the commanding officer of this squad of soldiers.


Core Gameplay
Select your squads gear. Spend your earned points on:   • Armor   • Pistols, rifles, flame-thowers, etc.   • Higher ranks   • Customize the soldiers’ appearance
Review the layout of the derelict ship and decide your strategy. Enter the level and proceed to the airlock:   • Control where the soldiers move and aim   • Defend your soldiers from the attacking Dross   • Take and hold key positions across the map of the spaceship   • Open and close doors   • Activate consoles   • Use the layout of the level to your advantage   • The mission is complete when your soldiers are at the exit
Your final grade is based on how intact your squad is by the end of the level.


The Story begins . . .
In the quest to discover new worlds, space travel has taken the human race to many new habitable planets. One such planet is X
This planet, rich in its natural resources, was once harvested for its valuable treasures. Specimens of unique and unusual plants, animals and minerals were collected and stored.
One animal specimen taken was the Dross. 

Varied environments
The Dross, an aggressive, insect-like race, has built a nest and infested the entire ship. Your mission is to take back the Derelict.
Features of Derelict
Sophisticated and complex Ai:   • The Dross are intelligent and will evaluate options to take the best route.   • The Dross adapt and learn from their mistakes, and from yours!
Story driven gameplay:  	•	40+ original levels of play   • Varied environments inside of the space ship
Arcade levels:   • Stand-alone levels   • Hone and increase skills   • Quick game play   • Hours of additional gameplay   • Separate level-up system   • Rewards for story mode
Emergent gameplay:   •	“Herding” Dross   • Manipulate the doors   • Control short range radio
These bugs will take the best route around fire and around locked doors:  • Capable of breaking through the doors and avoiding combat/gunfire   • Flank and sneak around the soldiers to attack from behind
Immersive environment:   • Lighting and shadows   • Flickering lights   • Individual corridor lights   • Minimal HUD


Gear & Guns There are different weapons for different purposes. Each weapon has its strengths and weaknesses. Players will use more powerful weapons as the game progresses.


Once you select your weapon, you need to consider what armor the soldier should wear, as it isn’t always the best idea to use the heaviest armor.


Be on the look-out for more powerful weapons and gear for the soldiers in updates.


How does the game play?
Derelict is a tactical thinking game: challenging yet fair; random yet predictable.
The soldiers must work as a team, using their strengths and protecting their weaknesses.
  • Fortify, defend, lure, advance   • Rake the corridors and the rooms, hold positions   • Reinforce your troops and don’t get too far ahead   • Make decisions quickly and adapt to the changing situation   • You are only as strong as your weakest team-mate   • Consider frontal attacks vs flanking attacks   • Strategize and execute a plan of attack and of defence   • Equip your soldiers with a variety of powerful gear   • Keep your guns facing forward and protect one another
Game plays smoothly on iPad 2 and above. Controls are smooth, responsive and intuitive.
Unique storyline full of suspense, intrigue and plot twists that break conventions. There are bonus levels that add to the game.

Is it a text message? An email? If you buy the occasional card, how long does it take you to select one? Is it a significant thought or is it something purchased on the run?</span></p>
<p>Our lives have greatly improved over the last decade... We're experiencing self driving cars, streaming movies out of thin air, video messaging between our smartphones, but when it comes to telling friends and loved ones how much we care about them on a physical card, we're constantly limited to just the few preassigned lines of text placed on a stock card... that shouldn't be 'enough' to convey our important message, nor should we settle for that just because it's viewed as a standard. It's time to revolutionize the card!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465260556/final_frame_al58nr.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>What makes Cloud Cards even more unique? The greeting card turns into a <b>digital picture frame</b> that will last forever. Update it from your smartphone via the wireless adapter at anytime with new <b>pictures</b> or <b>videos</b>. Keep the battery charged or the card plugged into an outlet for endless memories.

<li>That's it. You're done. Sign it, put it in an envelope and watch the jaw drop!</li>
<li>The card is fully rechargeable and can last for years.</li>

</div></div>","Did you ever take the time to look back and wonder what it takes now a days to deliver the message of love and support? Is it a text message? An email? If you buy the occasional card, how long does it take you to select one? Is it a significant thought or is it something purchased on the run?
Our lives have greatly improved over the last decade... We're experiencing self driving cars, streaming movies out of thin air, video messaging between our smartphones, but when it comes to telling friends and loved ones how much we care about them on a physical card, we're constantly limited to just the few preassigned lines of text placed on a stock card... that shouldn't be 'enough' to convey our important message, nor should we settle for that just because it's viewed as a standard. It's time to revolutionize the card!


What makes Cloud Cards even more unique? The greeting card turns into a digital picture frame that will last forever. Update it from your smartphone via the wireless adapter at anytime with new pictures or videos. Keep the battery charged or the card plugged into an outlet for endless memories.
The innovation of Cloud Cards and quality of work is definitely something to talk about... and the word is spreading fast! Cloud Cards are featured on these networks, their affiliates and many other publications. 



 What makes this campaign stress free for us is the fact that our creative process isn't just a theory with hopes and dreams of manifesting into reality. The manufacturing of the card is complete - and it's a success. Cloud Cards are ready NOW. They are FCC/CE/RoHs compliant and are imminent to hold a patent for their uniqueness in hardware & software operation. 







    
 


In a world governed by the need of instant gratification and more importantly easement in functionality, Cloud Cards seem to have the simplest answer:  Our Cards are manufactured with built-in wireless adapter for data transfers. It allows instant connection to the smartphone device with your stored video recording and animation, so it can be transferred to the card. No internet or data usage is required for video upload. Talk about ease of access. With just a couple of clicks on your smartphone you can start recording your message of love and support via our free app. Customize your card even further by easily selecting one of our high end animations to really wow your recipient. 
That's it. You're done. Sign it, put it in an envelope and watch the jaw drop!
The card is fully rechargeable and can last for years.
The sleek, traditional design of the card is about the same thickness or thinner than majority of the 'musical' cards available on the market today.
The perforated edge of the card allows for conversion of your gift into a lasting digital photo frame, that your recipient can update with new data at their convenience.
For those of our customers, sentimental to the traditional ways of the card, please note that the inside of Cloud Cards is left unfiltered, so hand written additions are supported, not to mention encouraged.

You could never guess who is his favorite TV-show character :)He is going to the Comic-Con dressed just like him.This is an event he must share with his cyber friends.Meet Sabrina:Sabrina is coming from a very wealthy family. Her dad owns the world most famous hotel chain. She has got thousands of followers. Not because of her family...but because of her sense of fashion. However this requires day and night  tweeting and sharing selfies.


You're probably thinking: ""Why this game doesn't come out on PC, Linux 
or at least Mac""? The game originally has been designed for mobiles, 
tablets and it delivers the best experience when players are using their
 fingers to control characters.One of the words you could describe our team is ""small"".  That is 
correct.
We knew this from the very beginning. However that could never stop us 
to create ""Hey, Look up!"" the way it looks today. We are very passionate
 about the game and have got everything we need to create something 
truly AMAZING.
We all proud to ""Think different"" :)  and to be DRAGONS.
However,...reaching our stretch goals means that we will have more 
dragons joining the team :) 


 
























Risks & Challenges  Although Draco Intra is an unheard of studio, we have the utmost 
confidence in our vision. Also, we've built a highly experienced team 
that can work through every obstacle.
That being said, game development comes with inevitable speedbumps including surprise costs and delays.
Our biggest challenge will be to port the game to lots of different 
platforms and reach new audiences. A challenge we cannot wait to face.   
Please help us to spread the word and use Indiegogo social sharing tools.Thank you :)",27.0,5,"1 Campaign

It should be not just another f2p game with a bunch of<br/>‘donate’, but something really new, really nice and memorable. In<br/>principle, all known indie projects offered something new, whether it<br/>was a gameplay, a story, an atmosphere or mechanics (perhaps all<br/>together and at once).

<p>Why do
we need this amount? - In order to completely develop the game.</p>
<p>All
money will go to pay salaries for artists, programmers, game
designers and animators, to purchase additional hardware and
software, to rent an office, to pay salaries for interpreters in
Spanish and English, to pay commissions for indiegogo, to pay postal
items, and for sweetie. :) We will account for every penny spent by
us.</p>

<p>You

creating the game now where everyone will be able to become better
oneself, survive the history, the atmosphere, the inspiration that we
experience every day, every hour, every minute, every second, and
every share of it. We don’t aim to earn millions, and we don’t
tend to buy yachts, villas and golden figurines. No! We just want our
game to have introduced something new in the gaming industry as a

<p>Надеюсь, Вас, дорогие игроки, читатели, критики и др., заинтересует данный проект, и вы непременно будете следить за ним и ждать его.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Для начала расскажу вам о себе и нашей команде.</p>
<p>Моё имя Родион, и я являюсь геймдизайнером и идейным вдохновителем нашей команды.</p>
<p>Остальные члены команды:</p>
<p><b>Дейланд</b> - Мозг и геймдизайнер нашей команды.</p>
<p><b>Максим</b> — геймдизайнер и программист в одном лице. Именно благодаря ему игра приобрела тот вид, в котором находится сейчас. Он очень ответственный и подходит к работе по максимуму. Даже когда он делает для себя выходной, он все равно что-то разрабатывает.</p>
<p><b>Антон</b> — художник по персонажам и дизайнер комиксов. Антон очень весёлый и позитивный человек, который сделал немало для того, чтобы у игры появилась база стилистики, от которой мы будем отталкиваться в дальнейшем.</p>
<p><b>Юрий</b> — левел-дизайнер, художник по персонажам и окружению. Он очень классно рисует. Нет, правда! Юрий очень хорошо умеет слушать и воплощать идеи на графическом холсте. Ему достаточно пары слов, чтобы воссоздать то, что мы хотим видеть. Его отношение к мелким деталям и детализации просто поражает. Он прорисовывает каждую мелочь, каждую деталь, за что ему отдельная благодарность.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><b>Идея:</b> </p>
<p>Итак, у меня появилось желание создать игру. Но не просто очередную f2p игру с кучей доната, а что-то действительно новое, действительно красивое и запоминающееся. В принципе, все известные инди-проекты предлагали что-то новое, будь то геймплей, сюжет, атмосфера, механика (возможно всё вместе и сразу). И я хотел так же: дать игрокам игру, которая останется в их сердцах надолго.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Текущая ситуация:</b></p>
<p>На данный момент, наши ресурсы исчерпываются, но мы безумно хотим продолжать разрабатывать эту потрясающую игру. Игра находится в стадии альфа-тестирования, мы полируем механику, разрабатываем локации, квесты, много интересных головоломок, и еще много чего. Мы не хотим, что бы наш проект умер, поэтому мы ищем все пути его развития. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Что нужно нам, и что получите Вы?</b><br/><br/>Для чего нам нужна такая сумма? - для того, чтобы разработать игру до конца. <br/>Все деньги пойдут на зарплаты художникам, на зарплаты программистам, геймдизайнеру, аниматору, покупку дополнительного оборудования и программного обеспечения, съем офиса, зарплаты переводчикам на испанский и английские языки, оплату комиссии indiegogo, оплату почтовых отправлений, и конфетки :) Мы отчитаемся за каждый цент, потраченный нами.</p>
<p>Вы можете помочь нам не только материально. Мы будем благодарны, если вы будете рассказывать о нашем продукте своим друзьям, коллегам, родственникам, и всем людям, которые вас окружают, или же которых вы знаете!!!<br/><br/>Так же мы можем рассмотреть Ваше эксклюзивное участие в разработке игры.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Зачем все это нужно? </b><br/><br/>Мы независимые разработчики, мы не получаем огромные гонорары, нас практически не знают, но мы живем идеей, живем мечтой, мечтой создать действительно стоящий проект, который не будет просить вас заплатить за то, что бы вы могли стать лучше, нет, мы создаем игру, где каждый по своему может стать лучшим, сможет пережить ту историю, ту атмосферу, то вдохновление, которое мы испытываем каждый день, каждый час, каждую минуту, каждую секунду и долю от нее. Мы не стремимся заработать миллионы, мы не стремимся покупать яхты, виллы, золотые статуэтки, нет, мы просто хотим что бы наша игра привнесла что-то новое в игровую индустрию в целом, ну и конечно-же мы не остановимся на достигнутом. <br/><br/>Мы хотим показать вам альтернативную историю исчезновения величайших цивилизаций Латинской Америки. Это потрясающая страна, которая богата своими культурными ценностями, и мы непременно выпустим эту игру. </p>
<div><br/></div>
<b>Что если?<br/></b><p><br/></p>
<p>Что если мы не сумеем собрать нужную сумму? - Это будет очень печально. Мы ставим акцент на indiegogo и на Вас, дорогие пользователи, на вашу поддержку, на ваш интерес к нашему проекту. Тем не менее, если мы соберем хотя бы часть заявленной суммы, мы сможем отодвинуть время вперед, для того что бы поискать альтернативные источники финансирования ( что конечно очень трудно сделать в России). </p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Дополнительная помощь. </b><br/><br/>Все мы любим социальные сети, общение и различные социальные сервисы. Мы будем безумно благодарны, если вы будете рассказывать о нашем продукте всем всем. Кто знает, может именно ваш репост или рассказ, поможет найти нам инвестора. <br/><br/>Спасибо большое за участие и поддержку. </p>

</div></div>","Hi, there! We are a budding team of indie developers, which, having the charge of enthusiasm, ideas, faith and, hopefully, your further support, decided to develop a game. :) I hope that you, dear players, readers, critics and so on, will be interested in the project, as well as you will definitely follow it and wait for it. First, I will tell you about myself and our team. My name is Rodion, and I’m a game designer and the mastermind of our team. Other members of our team are:
Deiland -  Gamedesigner. He is the brain center of our team 

Max – is a gamedesigner and programmer rolled into one. It is thanks to him the gamehas taken on the present look. He is very responsible and used towork at his maximum. Even when he has a day off, he still developssomething.Anton – is a characterartist and comics designer. He is very cheerful and positive personwho has provided the game with its own stylistics base, which weshall use later.Yurii – is a leveldesigner, as well as a character & environment artist. He’sreally cool artist. That’s true! Yurii is very good at listeningand implementing the ideas onto graphic canvas. Just a couple ofwords is enough for him to recreate what we wish to see. His attitudeto detail is simply amazing. He carefully draws every detail, sospecial thanks to him for that.                                     So, I got a desire tocreate a game. It should be not just another f2p game with a bunch of‘donate’, but something really new, really nice and memorable. Inprinciple, all known indie projects offered something new, whether itwas a gameplay, a story, an atmosphere or mechanics (perhaps alltogether and at once). And I wanted the same: to give the players agame that will remain in their hearts for a long time.

At the
moment, our resources are being exhausted, but we strongly want to
proceed developing this exciting game. The game is at the alpha
testing stage, and now, we polish mechanics, develop locations,
quests, a lot of interesting puzzles and many other things. We don’t
want our project to die, so we are looking for all ways of its
development.





Why do
we need this amount? - In order to completely develop the game.
All
money will go to pay salaries for artists, programmers, game
designers and animators, to purchase additional hardware and
software, to rent an office, to pay salaries for interpreters in
Spanish and English, to pay commissions for indiegogo, to pay postal
items, and for sweetie. :) We will account for every penny spent by
us.


You
can help us not only financially. We would be grateful if you tell
about our product to your friends, colleagues and relatives and
everybody who surrounds you or whom you know!!!


We can
consider your exclusive participation in the development of the game
as well.




We are
independent developers; we don’t get huge fees, and people almost
don’t know us. But we live with an idea; we ​​live with a
dream, a dream to create a really worthwhile project that will not
ask you to pay for something to become a better person. No! We are
creating the game now where everyone will be able to become better
oneself, survive the history, the atmosphere, the inspiration that we
experience every day, every hour, every minute, every second, and
every share of it. We don’t aim to earn millions, and we don’t
tend to buy yachts, villas and golden figurines. No! We just want our
game to have introduced something new in the gaming industry as a
whole, and, of course, we will not stop there.


We
want to show you an alternative history of disappearance of greatest
civilizations in Latin America. This is a fantastic country that is
rich in its cultural values. And we will certainly release this game.







What
if we fail to gather the required amount? - It will be very sad. We
put emphasis on indiegogo and on you, dear customers, on your
support, on your interest in our project. However, if we gather at
least a part of the amount claimed, we will be able to push the time
forward in order to look for alternative sources of funding (which,
of course, is very difficult to do in Russia).







Everybody
loves social networks, communication and various social services. We
will be incredibly grateful to you if you tell about our product to
everybody you know. Who knows, maybe, it is your repost that help us
to find an investor.


Thank you very much
for your participation and support!

with unlimited number of opponents. Everything will depend on the level 
of your warriors. When completing a mission you can take any member of 
your gang. Each class, in addition to the basic characteristics (damage,
 agility, defense, attack etc.), will have their own special skills. 
Thieves, for example, rely on their dexterity and try to deprive the 
weapons and potions of their enemies. Prostitutes, in their turn, are 
hysterical and will cry and wrung their hands in order to divert enemys'
 attention to another person and then strike back, goons can grip the 
enemy, restricting his movements and causing damage etc.Alchemy:
In addition to the variety of cold steel arms, alchemy is present 
in our game. With the help of this science (which is forbidden by the 
church) you can create explosives, which can be used in battles or to 
open locks; poisons to be used throughout missions against certain 
enemies; potions to enhance treatment and dexterity. In all the formulas
 real proportions and components are used (e.g. To make gunpowder you 
need 15 portions of saltpeter, 3 of charcoal, 2 of sulphur. To make a 
slow acting poison you need bamboo and green tea. To make sulfuric acid 
you need sulphur, water and saltpeter.). Highly experienced alchemists 
are capable of creating potions, which are able to change human body 
(appearance and skills).Other features and possibilities of the game:
Global events: fairs, riots, epidemics, rounded ups, changes of weather will significantly affect the development of the plot.
		Mini games: liquidation of traps, lock hacking, gambling etc.
		Some tasks have ""Interactive Fiction"" design.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

hard to rise and to be popular in the sector. We choosed the indiegogo to
success these facts.  We are developing
these projects with the ideal hardwares and softwares and we are targeting to
create well works with these ideal elements. We want to create  high quality works and to improve these works
as we are developing our programs. Our main project is a detailled survival
game. The concepts of this project has been prepared and it is waiting for the
time.  Our survival game will be faster
2times more thanks to this Madwarf game. But this fact is dependent to you.Our Survival project:We are
looking for your help to improve our projects and create a sector as we will
create an office for our team.                      Steam Green
Light, Google Play, Apple Store,Unity Pro accounts will be taken.Licences for
Programs: We are using Modelling and Animation Blender, and using photoshop for
texture mapping. Normally we are using Autodesk Max and Zbrush but for this project we
have to use blender.Autodesk
will change their system to the subscription at 31 July 2016. And we want to
buy Autodesk 3ds Max with the collected donations.Help us to
be able to create high quality games with high quality softwares.Music &
Audio :  We are planning to employ a
personel to make better quality of voices.Art : All
graphics of game is being created by us , however , we need well equipments to
be able to improve this project and to be able to create better charachters and
animations. The tablets and PCs are hardwares which are useful for daily using.
For example, We need Wacom Cintiq to be able to create detailled and well seen
charachters.Advertisement:
We need high budgeted advertisements to be able to reach the large masses with
our game.e.g Software Program License:Zbrush : 795$Autodesk 3Ds Max : 6.640$Photoshop : 140$(year or months)Unity : 1.500$Topogun : 250$Substance Painter : 590$Unity Assets : 500$               + ______________     Total :      10.415$                                         Steam  GreenLight    ✔  If we can
not reach the amount which we targetted, we will publish our game on certain
platforms and continue how much our budget is enough.First of all We will
supply the our software need with the enough amount of donation. And the rest
of donation , we will use for advertisement and music.The people
who can not help our budget can support us as they are sharing our game and
social networks. As you know, To make advertisement is harder as much as create
the game. If each supporter mentions to their friends about us, it will be so
helpful for us. And also, you can support us as you like our social networks
and as you are commenting us or criticising us.If the hard
disk part of our PCs does not broken, there will not be any kind of
problem.  If they will be broken, it will
take us one step back. We are backing up our project once in 2-3 weeks or when
there was an important developments. Maximum, if our PCs will have problems, we
can continue from the backed up part and we can complete the files which has
been lost when the PCs has broken.As our game
is published as single player, we dont expect any kind of problemSocial NetworksFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/akhalagames/Twitter : https://twitter.com/Akhala_GamesYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjgjH4uEwtF6Wwneu0fX1mA",45.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is Dynasty Owner?</h3>
<p>My name is Paul and I have had a dream of owning a sports franchise since 2003…and came weeks away from achieving this dream back in 2008. But alas, the deal fell through.</p>
<p>I know I’m not the only one with this burning desire. Us sports fans love to imagine what it would be like to own and run a franchise. When we’re watching the front office of our favorite team make decisions, we think we can draft better, make better trades, create better stadiums and atmospheres for the fans, etc. etc., but I digress.</p>
<p>Because of our passion, fantasy football has continued to grow in popularity to fill the desire of us sports nuts!</p>
<p>We’ve seen so many variations of fantasy sports in recent years. First, there were weekly games, the staple of fantasy sports. Then came daily games, which took fantasy sports to a whole new level. </p>
<p>However, I felt like there were several key things missing from fantasy football… And that’s how Dynasty Owner was born, out of a desire to create the ultimate dream for all sports and business fans. </p>
<p>Dynasty Owner combines dynasty fantasy football leagues (maintaining your team year after year) with actual NFL player salaries! No longer are you just trading players for players. You can now trade players for other players, draft picks, or Dynasty Dollars, our own virtual currency (no, it is not crypto).</p>
<p>It’s ownership and the front office meeting weekly fantasy sports to create the best long-term strategy esports game out there.  Don’t just play fantasy sports...own it.</p>
<p>Here’s how Dynasty Owner is different.</p>
<p>It is the first ownership/general manager dynasty game to use actual salary cap rules and contracts.  In other salary cap leagues, salaries are determined by player performance, but we believe that takes away the strategy involved with having salaries. We believe in the strategy of picking good contracts and value players, not just expensive performers. We do this by combining real-life salaries with fantasy sports.</p>
<p>Everyone complains about how dumb their local sports team owner and general manager are...well, now is <strong><i>your</i></strong> chance to prove how good you are.  This is as real as it gets without owning an actual team.</p>
<p>This game is about finding value and understanding the true player value to your team and to the league.</p>
<p>You can finally showcase your strategy skills and show your friends that it’s not just about picking the best players and getting a lucky draft pick here or there.</p>
<p>It’s about so much more. </p>
<p>It’s about using the constraints of salary caps and contracts to build a long-term dynasty. It’s about maneuvering the trade and draft processes to create the best team at the best value.</p>
<p>Dynasty Owner is here to fill a void in fantasy sports. Be your own owner, own your own game.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Your contribution will make a difference!</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a huge difference by helping Dynasty Owner stay independent from investors. Our goal is to build a platform for people who love to play the game. When investors get to be too big of a portion of the company, selling and making profit is the #1 driver…we want to make a great game <strong><i>while</i></strong> making a profit, even if that means less profit. And we don’t want to be forced to sacrifice on quality to simply get a good sale price.</p>
<p>We want to be able to continue to innovate and grow into baseball, basketball, and other sports. Your contribution means that Dynasty Owner can stay 100% focused on delivering the best user experience for the true fans.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Challenges we face...</h3>
<p>Online games are a high-risk proposition.  There are a lot of failures in the world of technology and many people create games in order to see what sticks.  The fortunate part is our cost structure allows us to have a break-even point much lower than most as we employ local developers who are much more cost-effective than typical Silicon Valley tech firms. </p>
<p>Even with that, however, this is an unproven method of fantasy sports and we are paving the way to a new game.  It is exciting but the market size is very small.  All fantasy sports players total 60 million people in the U.S. according to the Fantasy Sports &amp; Gaming Association, and we believe that our market is 2-3% of that (1.2MM to 1.8MM).  Since our customer can’t be found easily in the masses, we can't advertise to the masses. Our advertising costs are, therefore, much higher than other fantasy sports games.  In addition, our game does not have cash payouts, which is typical in fantasy sports; this will hinder our ability to get users.</p>
<p>Lastly, gaming laws are changing monthly.  We are not a gambling site, but the government and laws and lobbyists have tried to include fantasy sports, whether there is gambling or not, to be included in those laws. This increases our legal research and compliance costs.</p>
<p>We have had a hard time accepting credit card transactions due to our small size and being in fantasy sports even though we are not using any money to pay out as prize money.  We are working on this continually and even though we are working and close to getting credit card transactions, we don't know how laws will change or how banks will perceive our game and blindly block us from accepting credit cards.</p>

Even with that, however, this is an unproven method of fantasy sports and we are paving the way to a new game.  It is exciting but the market size is very small.  All fantasy sports players total 60 million people in the U.S. according to the Fantasy Sports & Gaming Association, and we believe that our market is 2-3% of that (1.2MM to 1.8MM).  Since our customer can’t be found easily in the masses, we can't advertise to the masses. Our advertising costs are, therefore, much higher than other fantasy sports games.  In addition, our game does not have cash payouts, which is typical in fantasy sports; this will hinder our ability to get users.
Lastly, gaming laws are changing monthly.  We are not a gambling site, but the government and laws and lobbyists have tried to include fantasy sports, whether there is gambling or not, to be included in those laws. This increases our legal research and compliance costs.
We have had a hard time accepting credit card transactions due to our small size and being in fantasy sports even though we are not using any money to pay out as prize money.  We are working on this continually and even though we are working and close to getting credit card transactions, we don't know how laws will change or how banks will perceive our game and blindly block us from accepting credit cards.

S'il remporte cette victoire, il prendra le contrôle d'une partie de l'Angleterre.De l'autre côté de la manche en plein cœur de son duché de Normandie, une comète file dans la nuit, s'apprêtant à s'abattre sur le village de l'Aigle.La chute de cet objet céleste sur l'église Saint Martin va engendrer une série d’événements qui vont bouleverser le cours de l'histoire tel que nous la connaissons et déclencher une terrible lutte de pouvoir pour contrôler ""La Porte des Fauconniers"".Vous êtes un Fauconnier à la tête de sa compagnie, un élu de la comète, prit dans le déchainement d'une guerre qui va ravager la région. Rejoindrez-vous le camp de l'Histoire ou celui de son changement ?  Voyagez en Normandie médiévale !La carte de campagne sur laquelle vous déplacerez votre compagnie se déroulera dans une Normandie médiévale fictive du XIème siècle.Vous pourrez y rencontrer des personnalités importantes de cette période et vous confronter ou vous allier aux seigneurs qui ont marqué l'histoire de la région. La composition et la fidélité historique du jeu seront réalisées en collaboration étroite avec notre partenaire youtubeur grand passionné du sujet : D-mystif 
Pour le Roi ou pour le Duché ? Les événements qui perturbent la région sont en train de rebattre les cartes géopolitiques. En tant que chef d'une compagnie de soldats, vous pourrez prendre part à des affrontements entre duché et roi en choisissant votre camp pour le contrôle ou la destruction de la Porte des Fauconniers :
Le duché de Normandie de Guillaume le Conquérant 
L'armée des comtés d'Anjou, du Maine, de Touraine et de Blois regroupée par le Roi Philippe Ier
Le clergé et ses mercenaires soutenus par le Pape Alexandre II
Un ordre naissant et fanatisé qui voue un culte à la Comète commandé par le premier des Fauconniers
L'Histoire affronte le Fantastique  Au-delà des enjeux politiques, la comète pourrait bien avoir altéré la région de façon importante sans que cela ne se fasse sentir immédiatement... Une lutte encore plus profonde et dangereuse que le simple contrôle de la Porte des Fauconniers et de la région Normande s'apprête à se jouer !Le Fantastique interviendra avec progressivité et ne sera pas omniprésent dans LPDF, à la manière de l'univers de Game Of Thrones. Il sera notamment pour nous un outil d'intégration et de rationalisation de certaines mécaniques de confort du joueur comme la vue stratégie ou la vue TPS elle-même. Un artisanat intelligentLa production de ressources dans LPDF se concentrera sur 4 matières : bois, métaux, rations, argent. Ils couvriront l'ensemble des besoins de votre armée. Pour exploiter ces ressources, votre troupe sera constamment talonnée sur la carte de campagne par un aéropage d'artisans, d'ouvriers, de fermiers et autres non-combattants qui s'occuperont des tâches courantes. Selon leur niveau et leur spécialisation, ils récolteront automatiquement de la nourriture dans les lieux environnant votre campement, produiront votre équipement et celui de vos hommes, et récolteront les ressources pendant vos haltes sur les points de récolte correspondants (forêts, champs, mines...). Ils viendront aussi compléter vos revenus en vendant vos surplus sur les places des villages et villes quand vous les traverserez. Une Narration à la hauteur de l'HistoireLa majorité des interactions hors combat s'effectueront via des menus textuels, directement sur la carte de campagne. Vous n'aurez pas à supporter d'interminables allers-retours entre différents interlocuteurs d'une même ville. Le cas échéant, vous pourrez résoudre une partie de vos échanges en donnant des instructions à vos conseillers qui se chargeront des basses besognes. Nous apporterons un soin particulier à la qualité de l'écriture et de la narration. C'est notamment Planet Wargame qui nous prêtera sa voix et sa plume pour les quêtes les plus importantes de l'aventure.  Les batailles, inspirées de Mount&Blade, se dérouleront en temps réel sur un terrain qui correspondra à votre emplacement sur la carte de campagne. De la forêt D'Ecouves jusque dans les plaines du Pays d'Auge, vous lutterez contre vos ennemis dans des environnements réalistes !LPDF vous plongera dans des affrontements impliquant plusieurs centaines de guerriers pour les combats les plus importants de l'aventure.60 soldats à personnaliser !De son recrutement à sa formation, chaque groupe d'unité évoluera au fil du temps et de vos rencontres. Les unités seront de types différents selon que vous les recrutiez dans une ville ou un village (milice rurale et communale), ou que vous louiez directement des mercenaires.Vous pourrez recruter jusqu'à 3 groupes de 20 combattants afin de former votre compagnie de 60 hommes selon le style de gameplay qui vous correspond le mieux. Libre à vous de composer cette compagnie de façon homogène en vous spécialisant dans un type d'arme, ou de créer une formation polyvalente utilisant plusieurs armes différentes. Des possibilités infinies Chacun de vos 3 groupes de combattants possédera son propre système d'expérience et de compétences. L'arbre des compétences offre des branches linéaires qui accorderont d'énormes bonus mais exigeront de suivre un chemin précis, ou vous laissera prendre différents nœuds de votre choix avec des effets moins intéressants mais plus nombreux. Vous bénéficiez par conséquent d'un nombre significatif de possibilités qui pourront transformer vos paysans désorganisés en soldats robustes et rompus à utiliser des formations dévastatrices.  Personnalisez les héros à vos côtés  Vous ne serez pas seul pour commander vos hommes sur le champ de bataille ! Trois hommes d'armes (des Sergents) vous épauleront sur les missions qui ne requièrent pas toute une armée.Certains Sergents seront des personnages historiques possédant une quête secondaire qui conditionnera leur déblocage, comme les descendants de la lignée de Robert Guiscard qui rentreront de Sicile pour protéger leur région d'origine. En complément, chaque groupe de 20 soldats possède un porte bannière et un joueur de corne qui vous aideront à distinguer vos hommes dans la mêlée et à transférer vos ordres. Dans le mode de difficulté le plus élevé, l'UI sera limitée et ils seront vos seuls points de référence pour commander ! Des Mécaniques de combat réalistes  Escrime directionnelle  Pour notre système de combat, nous restons soucieux de l'historicité de la gestuelle des affrontements et du respect de la martialité de l'époque. C'est pourquoi nous collaborerons avec la chaîne Entrer en lice pour produire nos animations. Ces pratiquants d'AMHE sont des plus compétents à nos yeux pour certifier du réalisme de nos animations de combat ! LPDF utilise une système de combat directionnel pour les frappes, avec arme et bouclier, et les parades. Un système de hitbox non conditionné par la parade permettra de frapper et de se protéger en même temps, et vous ne pourrez pas passer au travers de l'arme ou du bouclier de votre adversaire tant qu'il les tient en main. Dans la même idée, les lances dressées dévieront les flèches et retiendront les ennemis. Protection  Les pièces d'armures dans LPDF ne se contenteront pas de réduire les dégâts que vous subirez. Si elles sont suffisamment épaisses elles les bloqueront.Conformément aux usages de l'époque, vous devrez revêtir un dessous et un dessus d'armure pour bénéficier d'une protection complète. Le jeu possède un système de dégâts qui distingue les frappes tranchantes, contondantes et perforantes avec des propriétés différentes en fonction des trois catégories de matériaux : Tissu, Matelassé, Maille / Lamellaire.  Système de Santé/Conscience/Endurance LPDF possède un système de santé qui cherche à restituer la complexité du port d'une armure sur un champ de bataille durant des périodes de combats prolongées sans pour autant que le réalisme n'interfère trop avec les mécaniques de jeu. Nous avons conçu un système croisé de santé, conscience et endurance qui prendra en compte votre état de fatigue général et le répercutera sur votre capacité à vous battre efficacement. Chaque partie du corps possède sa propre hitbox et ses propres points de vies. Perdre un bras vous coûtera l'usage de l'équipement correspondant. Cependant, tant que votre thorax et votre tête sont intactes, vous pourrez toujours vous enfuir ou continuer à vous battre avec ce que vous porterez dans l'autre main. Enfin, si vos jambes ont survécu ! Une approche tactique des combats Chaque groupe de combattants utilisent des formations qui lui sont propres. Les épéistes seront des spécialistes de la formation en triangle  visant à briser facilement les murs de boucliers adverses en utilisant la concentration de leur masse en un point donné. Les lanciers quant à eux préféreront s'ancrer sur plusieurs rangs compacts en présentant un mur de lances  pour arrêter les charges de vos ennemis en utilisant l'empalement. Les Formations jouent un rôle clé dans LPDF. Elles possèdent des bonus/malus relatifs à l'unité qui les emploient et à la situation. Une unité dans la bonne formation repoussera des adversaires plus forts ou en surnombre s'ils sont désorganisés ou n'en suivent pas une eux-mêmes. De la Charge à la levée de boucliers Les capacités des unités se distingueront entre des aptitudes passives (santé bonus, endurance améliorée...) et des capacités actives qui seront déclenchées pendant la bataille. Les charges  sont une des capacités les plus classiques et communes de LPDF. Elles permettent de lancer l'unité (à pleine vitesse ou au pas chassé) vers l'ennemi.""Ouvrez les rangs"" sert, par exemple, à repousser les adversaires autour de vous afin de regagner de l'espace et de briser l'intensité de leur attaque tout en obtenant un bonus défensif.Du Fantassin au ChevalierL'infanterie et la Cavalerie formeront les deux corps d'unités de mêlée de LPDF :- La cavalerie se concentrera particulièrement sur sa capacité à lancer des charges irrésistibles en évitant soigneusement un mur de lances ancrées dans le sol. - L'infanterie occupera le terrain par la masse, l'utilisation de ses formations et une progression méthodique.Les archers auront un fonctionnement différent des unités classiques. Une fois débloqués et recrutés, ils vous accompagneront en bataille comme une unité de support dont vous devrez déclencher les tirs ""hors carte"" ou ordonner l'installation prolongée sur une position fixe où ils planteront leurs flèches dans le sol afin de tirer plus rapidement. Un gestionnaire tactique innovant Les compétences de votre personnage seront principalement utilitaires. Les Fauconniers ne sont pas des super-héros, vous ne pourrez pas rivaliser avec une armée à vous seul même si vous serez bien plus fort que le combattant moyen.La vue du Fauconnier  sera votre principale compétence utilitaire. Elle vous permettra d'obtenir une vue tactique instantanée afin d'optimiser le placement de vos troupes en quelques clics :Vous posséderez un large choix de compétences allant du simple bonus/malus de zone en passant par des enchaînements de frappes spéciales.A l'image de celui de vos unités, votre arbre des compétences (dont les Sergents posséderont une variante) vous poussera à faire des choix : se spécialiser dans une compétence ou en débloquer plusieurs, améliorer une large gamme de caractéristiques bonus ou se spécialiser dans une seule catégorie de bonus...  TROP AMBITIEUX POUR UN PETIT STUDIO ? SANS VOTRE AIDE : OUI ! LPDF est pensé dans sa structure pour nous simplifier le travail autant que possible sur les aspects subsidiaires de son développement. C'est l'une des raisons du choix d'Unity (2019.4.1f1 LTS) pour sa modularité. Le moteur est déjà prêt et nous n'avons qu'à assembler les éléments de notre jeu. Le choix de la Normandie au XIème siècle est aussi lié à cette volonté de penser LPDF comme un premier projet accessible pour une petite équipe ; la topographie et l'homogénéité culturelle de la zone faciliteront grandement notre travail de modélisation des terrains et des équipements. L'asset store déborde de modèles conformes à l'historicité que nous recherchons pour compléter nos propres modélisations. Palier 1 : 55.000 € Si nous atteignons cette somme vous pourrez commencer à tester LPDF dès sa première année. Nous veillerons à mettre l'alpha en ligne sur steam dans des bonnes conditions de jouabilité et dans des délais raisonnables : Juillet/Août 2021 pour la pré-alpha fermée et Octobre/Novembre 2021 pour l'alpha fermée, toutes deux réservées aux backers.Dans un souci de proximité et d'exclusivité avec notre public Francophone, l'ouverture au marché international ne débutera qu'à la sortie de la Bêta. Regrouper des talents et des passionnés pour assembler un jeu de qualité :Nos partenaires ont été sélectionnés pour la passion qu'ils mettent dans leur domaine de prédilection : Entrer en lice, D-mystif, Planet Wargame et Rêves D'Acier collaboreront avec nous sur le long terme, chacun dans leur spécialité :

D-Mystif est un passionné d'histoire qui sera notre consultant dans le domaine de la fidélité historique. Il nous aidera aussi à créer une uchronie aussi plausible et immersive que possible.

Planet Wargame peut sembler un peu éloigné de l'univers que dépeint LPDF, mais sa diction et son écriture en feront un narrateur exceptionnel pour notre jeu. Sa voix et ses textes vous accompagneront tout au long de l'aventure.

Rêves D'Acier se chargera de réaliser les ""goodies"" de notre crownfunding. Afin de rester aussi fidèle que possible à l'Histoire et à notre patrimoine, nous nous sommes naturellement tournés vers de véritables artisans médiévaux. Nous nous inspirerons aussi de leur travail pour nos modèles 3D.

- A game full of lovely Characters, Artifacts, Spells and Landscapes
Bring the Walruses to life - help us to make the dream real!Thats only possible with your help!                                       The Boardgame, inspired by masterpieces like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone, brings in a new Gameplay Mode, where all of your Friends can play together with one Carddeck against each other!Based on the succes of the Campaign:     *We can continue to finish the game!     *Develop and improve the game with the community!Status of the Game:
Game Design is written and finished
Promo Video finished A Personal Video is in the making
A lot testing games are to come
Around 80 cards are developed with strength and abilitys
Concepts to over 50 cards are done and some are complete finished
Developer is yet to find
Story behind the chieftains and the walruses is in work
Now lets come to the game:Cardhand preview:Each game
represents a battle between chieftains, who employ unique characters,
spells and artifacts to gain control of gold and treasures to be the king of all clans!Beginning and ending the game:Each player uses the same deck to play the game, a deck can be mixed with every ""Treasure King"" cards available; there is no maximum deck size.There are two piles on the Battlefield; the basic card pile and the gold card pile. Each player draws from the same pile, each turn from both - so you draw 2 cards each turn.In the middle of the table Players randomly choose a Landscape, who gives everyone the direction of the game and some battlefield additions. Like on the sketch:Than Players decide who will start. Each Players draw 5 cards (maximum cards in hand: 9) from the basic card pile. Than everyone plays with follow Parts of a turn: (similar to MtG)
Beginner phase
First main phase
Combat phase: *Beginning of combat *Declare attackers *Declare blockers *Combat damage *End of combat
Ending phase

IMPORTANT changes to MtG, Hearthstone and other Cardgames: 



Players can only attack players in the direction of the Landscape, which can only be changed by the Landscape.


Players dont have a lifecounter and can´t die

Characters who attack Players can steal Treasure from the enemy Player for his own use, to activate his special abilities. (One attack means always 1 Gold from the Treasure chamber)
Gold for the Treasure chamber and Treasure Abilities are the main innovation compared to standard card games
So the Goal is to steal the enemy Treasue, make your Characters stronger (who have major Treasure abilities) and collect as many Gold possible for your own Trasure chamber
and we have badass walruses... and magic chickens.... 

A player wins the game and become the King by:
 collecting more than 10 gold in his Treasure - this Player calls himself out ""Treasure King""
after that he must defend himself against every opponent in a final round, where everyone can attack the Treasue King
when the selfcalled ""Treasure King"" has at his next Beginner phase more than 10 gold he remain the Treasure King and wins the game.
Now spoiler some cards:Artifacts: (and take a closer look to the awesome chicken)Artifacts represent Objects who remain on the Battlefield. But unlike to Artifacts in other Cardgames - this Artifacts have health.The Chickenbell scepter is the first superfun card we want to Spoiler. Summon a Character into a chicken, how cool is that?                     Now look a bit closer to the card:
Under the Name you will read the Card Type, that will be used to specify the card. 

The Card Gold Cost declare how much Treasure the Player must tap to bring it on the Battlefield.
New to other card games is the Artifact Health, which means that the card can be targeted by Sorcery Spells.

The Main Card Ability is the Main Skill from the Card who can always be used, compared to the Treasure Special Ability.
The Ability with the money bag always require Treasures to sacrifice; or some Treasures under the Character, to activate.
Characters:Characters represent humanised creatures, who can attack enemy chieftains - steal Treasures to get access to the Special Treasure Ability.Look at this big fat chieftain we got for you:                      
The different to Artifacts is that he has a Strength Symbol on the right top corner.
This means his Attack and his Health. Fights a character another character with the same strenght, both die - otherwise the stronger survive and gets damage for this turn. 

Do you ever beeing attacked by a pack of crazy walrus boys? We dont think so!









Spells - Instant Sorcery:
There is only one kind of Spell - Instant Sorcerys.
They never enter the battlefield. Instead, they take effect and then are immediately put into their owner´s graveyard.
They also have 2 effects. The normal card effect and a special Treasure effect.
Or maybe summon a strong and smelly Walrus Beer for your characters?
                       
These are only 4 of over 100 cards in the walrus edition!






Goals and Stretched Goals:
5000€:  We complete the Drawings from all 100 Cards + Treasure Cards in the Walrus Edition and polish the Game Design. 
7000€: Special and exclusive Cards and Landscapes for everyone who supports our game. 
9000€: We add another 10 exclusive Goana Cards to you guys! Also more Landscapes and Walrus Cards.
12000€: Lets start the second Edition... with 100 or more Cards... 
20000€+: Let´s create a Universe with Goanas, Lizards, Dragons, Unicorns, Cows and... :) let´s dream about it!

Anyway, thank you guys for help! Together we can do this!

you for checking us out. We are Healwind Studios, a small team of experienced
game developers who aim to create games that make you smile!<br/></p><p>Welcome to the crowd funding campaign of <i>Pushy Robo</i>, a top-down 2D action maze
puzzle game designed for iOS devices.  In
this game you navigate a robot through a maze. Using the environment to your advantage,
you push boxes down a corridor and crush all enemies that got caught in its
path.  </p>
<p>At Healwind Studios, we are all huge fans of classic arcade
games, and <i>Pengo</i> is definitely one of
our favorite. We love it so much that we want to play it all the time, and
there’s nothing more portable than our mobile devices. Unfortunately, there were
no games on the iOS that gave us the same satisfaction we experienced in <i>Pengo. </i></p>
<p>With this in mind we started creating <i>Pushy Robo </i>about half a year ago, so that gamers like us can enjoy some
box sliding crushing time right in our hands, any time we want. We make sure
<i>Pushy Robo</i> stays true to the core
gameplay of <i>Pengo</i> while adding many
new features into the game that we are sure you will love.</p><p><br/></p><p></p>

are fully committed to make this game a reality, each of our team members is
surviving on savings right now, and sadly they are running dangerously low.  The good news is that the game is about 85%
completed at the moment, and with your help we can definitely live to see it release

<p>Before we go on about our history, let me begin by quoting
the company Interplay… </p>
<p><b><i>“BY GAMERS. FOR GAMERS”</i></b></p>
<p>That’s right! We are gamers well before we became
developers. As gamers ourselves, we understand the frustration when the game developers
ignore the voices of gamers. Many developers often feel that since they made
the game, it belongs to them and as such they can do whatever they want with
it. I am not a fan of that philosophy. I believe that the game belongs to all
of us, both the developers and the community. As developers, it is our
responsibility to listen to the community and improve the game. </p>
<p>We are Healwind Studios, a small indie game studio in Hong
Kong founded in 2012 by four experienced PC/Mobile game developers with over 10
years in the game development industry. My name is Hillwins Lee, the founder of
Healwind Studios and the game designer for <i>Pushy
Robo</i>. I come from a PC game development and production background, if you

<p>We understand that there are a lot of crowd funding game projects
never deliver what they promised to or take a very long time before it gets
released. Unlike many of these projects, <i>Pushy
Robo</i> is almost ready right now, what we need is your generous support to
help us polish it to perfection. We are committed to release the game as soon
as we can, unfortunately we may take a much longer time to complete it without
your help. </p>

</div></div>","Thank
you for checking us out. We are Healwind Studios, a small team of experienced
game developers who aim to create games that make you smile!Welcome to the crowd funding campaign of Pushy Robo, a top-down 2D action maze
puzzle game designed for iOS devices.  In
this game you navigate a robot through a maze. Using the environment to your advantage,
you push boxes down a corridor and crush all enemies that got caught in its
path.  
At Healwind Studios, we are all huge fans of classic arcade
games, and Pengo is definitely one of
our favorite. We love it so much that we want to play it all the time, and
there’s nothing more portable than our mobile devices. Unfortunately, there were
no games on the iOS that gave us the same satisfaction we experienced in Pengo. 
With this in mind we started creating Pushy Robo about half a year ago, so that gamers like us can enjoy some
box sliding crushing time right in our hands, any time we want. We make sure
Pushy Robo stays true to the core
gameplay of Pengo while adding many
new features into the game that we are sure you will love.
Making a game costs a lot of money, time and effort. While we
are fully committed to make this game a reality, each of our team members is
surviving on savings right now, and sadly they are running dangerously low.  The good news is that the game is about 85%
completed at the moment, and with your help we can definitely live to see it release
very soon. 
We are at the most critical phase right now and desperately need your help in keeping us
alive to polish the game to perfection!                 (Development build)Pushy Robo is a top-down 2D maze puzzle action game designed
for iOS devices.  In this game you
navigate a robot through a maze. Using the environment to your advantage, you
push boxes down a corridor and crush any enemies that got caught in its path. The
core gameplay is inspired by the 80s classic arcade game “Pengo”, with many new and exciting features added. We want to honor
the original Pengo and at the same
time improving it with some ideas of our own. Our goal is to make the game more
fun without forgetting what you love in Pengo. 




The goal in Pushy Robo is to eliminate all spawned
enemies within a level. You can do this by:


Push
a crate and smash your enemy to pieces.

Pull
some Minority Report stunt and
destroy the crate containing an enemy before it spawns.

Zap
to stun an enemy and roll it over. 


Use
the environment to your advantage. 



These power ups are
available to help you out!

Speed: Improve your top speed while this power
up is in effect Zapper: Recharge your zapper


Scoring Tips



Similar to Pengo,
connect these in a horizontal or vertical line to score massive points!




Score
more points by destroying multiple enemies with a single push
Destroying enemies by using
walls and conveyor belts will yield more points
Collect
and complete the set of letters “B O N U S” for massive bonus points
Perform
better than the “Par time” to earn time bonus points

$7,500 50 levels We will pack in a total of 50 levels at launch.
$10,000 New power up! We will add a new power up. We will release an update containing this
power up once we thoroughly test it.

enemy in some of the existing levels once we thoroughly tested it.
$40,000 Android version! We will immediately begin to develop the Android version of Pushy Robo after iOS version released.
$50,000 Brave new world! We will create a new world featuring 30 new levels with new graphics. This
update will become available once we thoroughly tested it.

Before we go on about our history, let me begin by quoting
the company Interplay… 
“BY GAMERS. FOR GAMERS”
That’s right! We are gamers well before we became
developers. As gamers ourselves, we understand the frustration when the game developers
ignore the voices of gamers. Many developers often feel that since they made
the game, it belongs to them and as such they can do whatever they want with
it. I am not a fan of that philosophy. I believe that the game belongs to all
of us, both the developers and the community. As developers, it is our
responsibility to listen to the community and improve the game. 
We are Healwind Studios, a small indie game studio in Hong
Kong founded in 2012 by four experienced PC/Mobile game developers with over 10
years in the game development industry. My name is Hillwins Lee, the founder of
Healwind Studios and the game designer for Pushy
Robo. I come from a PC game development and production background, if you
are interest in finding out more, please check out this
link at MobyGames.
Our team:
Hillwins Lee, Game Design. 13 years of game
development experience in PC, mobile, web, social and mmo games.  
Kin Ma, Art. 14 years of PC, mobile, web, social
and mmo game development experience. 
Jackie Yau, Programming. 5 years of MMO/Mobile
game development experience.
Rickie Kwong, Game Design. 4 years of game production
and development experience.

Here are some of the games that we took part in development
over the years:




We understand that there are a lot of crowd funding game projects
never deliver what they promised to or take a very long time before it gets
released. Unlike many of these projects, Pushy
Robo is almost ready right now, what we need is your generous support to
help us polish it to perfection. We are committed to release the game as soon
as we can, unfortunately we may take a much longer time to complete it without
your help. 
Your donations will:



Help us improve Pushy Robo sound effects


Help us improve Pushy Robo graphics


Help us pay our annual business expenses such as
business registration fees, mail server, domain etc.


Help our staff to pay their rent


Keep electricity running in our home offices so that
we can continue to work on Pushy Robo










Aside from donating, you can also help us out tremendously
by spreading the word. Got some friends who like classic action games? Let them
know we really can use some help right now. If you have any questions or
suggestions, please kindly let us know in the comments section, we will view
all of them and respond as soon as we can!
Once again, thank you very much for your time and interest
in our campaign!

<div>
<p>Back in 2011 I started a video production company with a few of my friends, which I've been running with them for the last four years. I've learnt in that time how to create interesting content, but I was always a behind-the-camera kind of person. Then the Scottish Independence Referendum came around, and everything changed.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Carnival of Democracy</h3>
<p>Scotland is still in the middle of a democratic upheaval, where long standing traditions and expectations are disappearing. I started creating video 10 months ago as the referendum approached, covering news and stories that I felt weren't being explored in the mainstream press. Those videos were watched over 135,000 times.</p>
<p>And that’s only the beginning.</p>
<p>Scotland wanted a vibrant alternative media. Six months on from the referendum, and it’s still growing.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Is Left:Scotland?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Left:Scotland will be an online channel covering left-wing and radical politics in Scotland. It will include at least one regular weekly show that is a continuation of my previous work, plus it’ll also become a resource for activists, creating content in collaboration with other groups across the country.</p>
<p>I'll be creating educational videos exploring political ideas, as well as providing useful information.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ever wanted to know how to organise a demo in George Square? Or how to get a community campaign off the ground? Me too, and I intend to answer those questions in short series of videos for everyone. But I need your help to make that happen.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Where Does the Money Go?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Every penny raised helps me to build an online channel, for the public, funded by the public. That means:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Regularly scheduled programming</span><br/>

</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A spotlight on campaigns and community victories</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>Funding will allow me to create content full time for a solid six months. It also goes into necessary equipment and advertising to help spread the word.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Social media has become one of the most disruptive tools we’ve got to spread news and views that no-one else is covering. We are all connected, and we are changing the way we create and consume information. And I want you to be a part of it.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Perks?</b></h3>

<h3><b>What If You Raise More Than What You Are Asking For?</b></h3>
<div>That would be amazing. And if that happened, it would mean more content, with more people involved.</div>
<br/>
</div>
</div>","**UPDATE**On Friday the 8th of May the Conservatives were elected as a majority party in the UK. The UK press is broadly right-wing and sympathetic to David Cameron. Now, more than ever, we need a strong alternative media in Scotland that gives a platform to voices on the left and challenges the spin we'll be hit with every day.That Latest Update on the Campaign is BelowThe First Step

Back in 2011 I started a video production company with a few of my friends, which I've been running with them for the last four years. I've learnt in that time how to create interesting content, but I was always a behind-the-camera kind of person. Then the Scottish Independence Referendum came around, and everything changed.

Our Carnival of Democracy
Scotland is still in the middle of a democratic upheaval, where long standing traditions and expectations are disappearing. I started creating video 10 months ago as the referendum approached, covering news and stories that I felt weren't being explored in the mainstream press. Those videos were watched over 135,000 times.
And that’s only the beginning.
Scotland wanted a vibrant alternative media. Six months on from the referendum, and it’s still growing.

So now I'm leaving my company to start something new.



What Is Left:Scotland?


Left:Scotland will be an online channel covering left-wing and radical politics in Scotland. It will include at least one regular weekly show that is a continuation of my previous work, plus it’ll also become a resource for activists, creating content in collaboration with other groups across the country.
I'll be creating educational videos exploring political ideas, as well as providing useful information.


Ever wanted to know how to organise a demo in George Square? Or how to get a community campaign off the ground? Me too, and I intend to answer those questions in short series of videos for everyone. But I need your help to make that happen.

Where Does the Money Go?



Every penny raised helps me to build an online channel, for the public, funded by the public. That means:



Regularly scheduled programming


Interviews


A resources for activists


A spotlight on campaigns and community victories




Funding will allow me to create content full time for a solid six months. It also goes into necessary equipment and advertising to help spread the word.


Social media has become one of the most disruptive tools we’ve got to spread news and views that no-one else is covering. We are all connected, and we are changing the way we create and consume information. And I want you to be a part of it.

Perks?
Why yes, there are! Ranging from badges up to being a named sponsor, there are plenty of perks. Every penny helps, but no matter how much you donate you'll be invited to a launch night once funding has closed, where I'll be collecting for a local food bank.

Costs associated with this project are directly linked with providing the user with an experience that can be enjoyed on their chosen systems, using their hardware of choice, and in their native language. In order to provide everyone with the opportunity to do this, we really need your help. </p>

<p>Developing a game on the scale of Capsa and with the level of support we are determined to incorporate is a huge undertaking.  The inherent risks and associated challenges are hurdles that must be overcome to provide you and our other end users with something of true value, as nothing of any significance is ever easily obtained.</p>
<p>The largest concern we are faced with is enabling the client to run on different operating systems.

Ongoing development will allow us to be certain that we can deliver optimal functionality across all platforms</p>
<p>Supporting every single language on steam may seem to be an excessive undertaking to some, but to us, it is simply incorporating our belief of inclusiveness into Capsa. We want as many people as possible to be able to enjoy Capsa with their friends, regardless of their native language. We expect to have all languages supported within 6 months after launch. The actual time required will be based upon how long it takes translators to complete the translations.</p>
<p>Given all the risks and challenges we currently face, the greatest risk is not receiving the funding we need as this will seriously affect our ability to achieve the level of support we really want to provide and our end users deserve.</p>

This team consists of myself and my husband! I am a game design college graduate and am trying to work on getting our first card game out. We have been working on this project for over a year, we hired an artist to help us with the cards and are really excited to let more than just close friends get a chance to play! We're trying to raise the money to pay the artist and print out the card game to the masses. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>We need a total of $7500 USD. The reason for this amount is to print out large quantities of the game, package them and ship them out to stores and make them available online. <br/></p>
<p>We want to give the artist the promised $1000. <br/></p>
<p>$3830 goes to printing out 500 decks of the cards and 500 Ultra Pro boxes to carry them in. <br/></p>
<p>$1000  in expected shipping costs to ship them to stores in California, Florida, Washington, Oregon and individuals who donated the specified amount.</p>
<p>$1000 to pay for advertising and overhead/housing of the card games at the stores. <br/></p>
<p>$100 in stickers to put on the ultra pro boxes. <br/></p>
<p>The extra amount of $580 remaining is a cushion for anything that may exceed the previously documented amounts due to time changing the prices and fees. <br/></p>
<p>If the goal amount isn't made, the first thing we're planning on doing is paying our wonderful artist and then ordering the cards that we can to go from there. <br/></p>
<p>We are going to have various perks, $1 donations we will send out thank you emails, $5 we send a physical thank you letter with a Crit Card included from our original play test decks. $10 we send a thank you letter and a signed Crit Card from myself and my husband. $20 dollars and we send you a copy of the game, and a signed Crit Card. $50 dollar donations get you everything from the $20 dollar bonus and a special thank you added into the instruction cards that will come with every deck. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<p>We have had quite a few play testers throughout the United States and some of the feedback we've received has been:</p>
<p>""This game is so easy to play, you only need two players, but it's amazing with 4 plus!""</p>
<p>""This is one of the best drinking games ever!""</p>
<p>""We used D6s and D20s to keep track of points but we should have just used our shot glasses""</p>
<p>""It's a creative way to attack your friends without going to jail ;)""</p>
<p>More than anything, we're trying to follow our dream and share it with people. Card games are something many of us have enjoyed for years; we'd like to keep the card games going, the tradition, and the togetherness. <br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.</p>
<p>It has taken us over a year to get to this point because honestly, I've been very down on myself; I've had a lot of doubt about my capabilities to do anything when I haven't been able to find a job after college. Through friends and my husband who was a major designer in this process I realize I shouldn't let my own insecurities be a downer on everyone. The first step is enjoying what you do, and we've already done that; the second step is to actually get our there and do it. So here we are. We've had plenty of issues trying to get boxes made, scheduling pre-orders so that we didn't have to go through crowdfunding and small nuances; I had decided it was more important for me to have any job than to work on games. My husband, family and friends reminded me that following my dream is never stupid, nor should it be put on the sidelines that way. Now, I'm not going to let anything hold us back! It took a while for me to stop worrying about everything and just go for it. When I realized I was holding more than just myself back, I stopped. I also had to convince myself that it's okay to ask for help; so here we are, asking for help.</p>

<p>Greetings everyone and thank you for taking a look at my campaign for my subscription box idea called Gaming Stash. <br/><br/>My name is Luis and I have been a gamer since
as far back as I can remember. I grew up with games and I have always loved how
they can bring people together. I still remember playing word games with my
mother, video games with my dad and strategy games with my cousins and school friends.</p>
<p>As I grew older, I became more and more interested in what is
considered the ""gaming"" community and expanded my gaming tastes to
include Pen &amp; Paper RPGs (I was a ruthless GM), Strategy Games (""Do I need to
invade Russia?...Yes. Yes I do."") and Card Games. (""Counter it""
became a phrase people hated me for.)</p>
<p>This project grew out of that love of gaming and the lack of
access to a good gaming source back in my hometown in Puerto Rico. When I moved
to Florida a few years back and visited a local Comic Shop, I was amazed at all
the different board games and miniatures games that existed. I learned to play
them, and as I did I enjoyed getting to know people that shared my interests.<br/><br/>Through Gaming Stash I hope to bring new games to any gamer that wants to try something new or that may have heard of some games but never had a means to acquire them. It is also my hope to encourage gamers to meet up and play together at their homes or local comic shops. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Gathering resources and lucky die rolls.</h3> <p>While going into a new game without prior knowledge of it is exciting, going into a venture without information is never a viable option. Here are some of the more common questions that could come up in relations to the project. If you have any concerns not listed here you can contact me at any moment and I will answer everything as best I can. </p>
<p><b>What kind of games will be
included in each stash?</b><br/>
<br/>
Each month's Gaming Stash will center around a gaming theme. These will range
from ""Pixels"" to ""Horror"" and will include games and
accessories that will revolve around these themes. The games will be chosen randomly though. Everyone will receive the same game but you will not know which game it will be until it arrives.<br/>
<br/>
The games included in each box can range from Cooperative games to Deck
Building games and even to Pen and Paper Role Playing Games. As well as accessories such as Expansions for the games, gaming tokens, protective sleeves, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately the goal of this project is to give gamers new and exciting games to
try out with their friends or to try out with their local gaming community.
Thanks to the variety of games carried by our supplier, I will make sure to
bring the best that the gaming world has to offer to my subscribers each and
every single month.<br/><br/>
<b><span>How will the Subscription Service work?</span></b><br/>
<br/>
Once the project is successfully launched the cost of each box will be $40.
This price includes the standard shipping costs and we will initially ship only
within the United States. It is my hope that as the subscribers grow I will be able to
expand the service to ship worldwide.<br/>
<br/>
Each month the theme of the box will change and the game, or games, inside will
reflect this theme. The value of the games and accessories in each box will
always be $50 or more. </p>
<p>It is our goal to bring gamers
new products to enjoy while making sure we can deliver the best possible bang
for their buck. <br/><br/>
<b><span>What will you use the donated funds for?<br/></span></b><br/>
Like in any good strategy game, the key to success and victory is good resource
management. The funds that are raised by this project will be used to acquire
the best tabletop games and accessories possible from dedicated suppliers in
our area.<br/><br/>I have already created a partnership with one of the major gaming
distributors in my area but there is still much more that will need to be done
in order to ensure that we can deliver a large variety of products to our
fellow gamers.<br/>
<br/>
With these funds we will invest in the games and accessories that will be
delivered to you monthly, as well as use the fund to purchase the custom boxes
needed to fit the games we will be shipping out as many of them vary in size
and dimensions.<br/>
<br/>
As we start out we will be shipping just games and accessories, but as we
expand we will be able to include other items that match the theme and style of
the Table Top Gaming community such as graphic t-shirts, collectible items,
Gaming Stash Exclusives and more.<br/>
<br/>
We will also use the funds to create a custom web page where we will be able to
provide you with a better interface, direct contact links and links to
different resources that every gamer should have at their disposal.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Perils on the journey ahead.</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Starting a project like this isn't without challenges. Some game companies and publishers require that distributors sell only
to physical stores and others require a direct supply chain from them to the
distributor in order to get their supplies going.</p>
<p>While this will initially be a challenge, I hope that the
success of this project will allow me the opportunity to reach out to these
publishers and create the partnerships needed to make sure I can always
provide you with the best and most noteworthy games that will keep you and your
fellow gamers entertained month after month.</p>
<p>While I work on creating these partnerships, I will also look into
other methods of acquiring these games so that I can still provide you with
these great options without affecting the price or charging any premiums. (Only
Goblins and Gnolls do that. And I am not a Goblin or a Gnoll. I swear...)</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Recruit fellow gamers!</h3> <p>Everyone can contribute to this campaign even if they can't donate towards the goal. Spread the word through your guilds and gaming communities. Help this campaign reach as many gamers as possible so that we can successfully launch our service and make sure everyone's Gaming Stash is filled with the best games around!</p>

Like in any good strategy game, the key to success and victory is good resource
management. The funds that are raised by this project will be used to acquire
the best tabletop games and accessories possible from dedicated suppliers in
our area.I have already created a partnership with one of the major gaming
distributors in my area but there is still much more that will need to be done
in order to ensure that we can deliver a large variety of products to our
fellow gamers.

With these funds we will invest in the games and accessories that will be
delivered to you monthly, as well as use the fund to purchase the custom boxes
needed to fit the games we will be shipping out as many of them vary in size
and dimensions.

As we start out we will be shipping just games and accessories, but as we
expand we will be able to include other items that match the theme and style of
the Table Top Gaming community such as graphic t-shirts, collectible items,
Gaming Stash Exclusives and more.

We will also use the funds to create a custom web page where we will be able to
provide you with a better interface, direct contact links and links to
different resources that every gamer should have at their disposal.



    Perils on the journey ahead.  
Starting a project like this isn't without challenges. Some game companies and publishers require that distributors sell only
to physical stores and others require a direct supply chain from them to the
distributor in order to get their supplies going.
While this will initially be a challenge, I hope that the
success of this project will allow me the opportunity to reach out to these
publishers and create the partnerships needed to make sure I can always
provide you with the best and most noteworthy games that will keep you and your
fellow gamers entertained month after month.
While I work on creating these partnerships, I will also look into
other methods of acquiring these games so that I can still provide you with
these great options without affecting the price or charging any premiums. (Only
Goblins and Gnolls do that. And I am not a Goblin or a Gnoll. I swear...)
    Recruit fellow gamers! Everyone can contribute to this campaign even if they can't donate towards the goal. Spread the word through your guilds and gaming communities. Help this campaign reach as many gamers as possible so that we can successfully launch our service and make sure everyone's Gaming Stash is filled with the best games around!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3></h3><p><b>LE PROMOTEUR</b></p>
<p>Manager
passionné, ambitieux, épris d’innovation et ayant une attitude orientée sur les
résultats, <b>Roly Khentache </b>a toujours eu un rêve : devenir entrepreneur,
créer des emplois et concourir à l’édification d’une Afrique entreprenante et
ambitieuse. Il est diplômé de l’Institut Franco-Allemand des Techniques,
d’Economie et des Sciences de Metz (France) et Saarbrücken (Allemagne). Après
une brève expérience professionnelle à UPS (United Parcel Services) Europe à
Bruxelles comme Ingénieur Industriel, il décide de retourner en Afrique
réaliser ses rêves. A son retour en 2012, il est contacté par UPS Togo pour une
pige d’un an et demie où il officie comme Directeur Commercial et des
Opérations. Une fois ce contrat terminé il retourne au Cameroun où depuis 2014
il a créé Bimbia, entreprise conceptrice des P.C. Card (Professional Club
Card).</p>
<p><b>P.C.
Card </b></p>
<p><b>P.C.
Card </b>(Professional
Club Card) est une carte privilège (carte de fidélité et de paiement) destinée
aux professionnels et qui leur permettra de recevoir des réductions et
avantages conséquents chez nos partenaires (Cf. <a href=""http://www.the-proclub.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.the-proclub.com.</a>), le but
pour nous étant de  booster le pouvoir d’
achat, et donc la motivation des professionnels, leviers essentiels dans le
développement de notre société, la découverte, la consolidation et / ou la
création des richesses et de  contribuer
à la fidélisation des clients, à l’ acquisition de nouveaux clients chez nos
partenaires.</p>
<p>Ressource première et essentielle dans la
création et la pérennisation des richesses, les professionnels et les
travailleurs, énormément sollicités par la société (sur le plan professionnel,
sociétal et privé), ne bénéficient presque jamais d’avantages et de facilités
qu’offre la société à d’autres catégories de personnes. Au contraire… Cette
situation faisant éclore du stress, du mal-être, des maladies, dévastatrices
autant pour ces derniers que pour les entreprises dans lesquelles ils
travaillent (baisse de productivité et d’efficacité), ne pouvait nous laisser
indifférent. Il devenait de plus en plus urgent d’agir et d’apporter des
solutions durables pour combattre ces maux en s’attaquant à leurs causes. C’est
ainsi qu’est née, sous le modèle de la « Social Business », l’idée de la carte
P.C. Card qui vous est fièrement proposée par <b>Bimbia, </b>et qui en ce
moment est en pleine phase de développement<b>. </b></p>
<p><b>DEVENEZ CONTRIBUTEUR</b></p>
<p>Contribuer
à ce projet nous sera d’une grande utilité en ce moment où nous voulons
accélérer son implémentation. En tant que contributeur vous participerez au
succès d’un projet novateur et à fort potentiel de croissance qui commencera au
Cameroun, mais  que nous souhaitons
ouvrir à d’autres pays à travers le monde, mais surtout vous contribuerez à Offrir aux professionnels et
travailleurs de toute race, sexe, religion et nationalité une solution qui leur
permettra d’avoir accès, avec beaucoup de joie au divertissement, à la détente,
au bien-être, au sourire, tout en boostant leur pouvoir d’achat.</p>
<p>87%
du montant que nous souhaitons récolter sera destiné au financement de la
commande de 2500 cartes (minimal requis) de paiement  cobrandé auprès d’une multinationale opérant
dans le secteur de la monétique et le reste nous servira surtout à booster
notre communication le temps du lancement des cartes. </p>
<h2>ANALYSE
DES RISQUES</h2>
<p>Il s’agit ici des aléas
mesurables, inhérents aux états de la nature au sein de laquelle l’entreprise
mènera ses activités. L’objectif ici est de recenser ces différents aléas, les
analyser, dans le but de les ‘‘maîtriser’’ en indiquant comment parer à leurs
éventuelles survenances. Trois principaux types de risques peuvent impacter
négativement la capacité de Bimbia Sarl à mener à bien ses objectifs. Ce sont pour
le moment le risque commercial et le risque politique (ou risque pays).</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">LE RISQUE
COMMERCIAL</a></h3>
<p>C’est principalement, la
probabilité de ne pouvoir réaliser par Bimbia Sarl, les objectifs commerciaux
qu’elle a prévu de réaliser. Il s’agit notamment des objectifs relatifs aux
chiffres d’affaires indiqués dans le compte d’exploitation prévisionnel</p>
<p><b>  Niveau de risque : Moyen.</b></p>
<p>Un marché formel dans notre cœur de
métier n’étant pour le moment pas encore constitué, le nous comptons user de
stratégies afin de  mettre sur pieds un
modèle de commercialisation très favorable à l’attrait à la  fidélisation de la clientèle.</p>

<br/></div>","LE PROMOTEUR
Manager
passionné, ambitieux, épris d’innovation et ayant une attitude orientée sur les
résultats, Roly Khentache a toujours eu un rêve : devenir entrepreneur,
créer des emplois et concourir à l’édification d’une Afrique entreprenante et
ambitieuse. Il est diplômé de l’Institut Franco-Allemand des Techniques,
d’Economie et des Sciences de Metz (France) et Saarbrücken (Allemagne). Après
une brève expérience professionnelle à UPS (United Parcel Services) Europe à
Bruxelles comme Ingénieur Industriel, il décide de retourner en Afrique
réaliser ses rêves. A son retour en 2012, il est contacté par UPS Togo pour une
pige d’un an et demie où il officie comme Directeur Commercial et des
Opérations. Une fois ce contrat terminé il retourne au Cameroun où depuis 2014
il a créé Bimbia, entreprise conceptrice des P.C. Card (Professional Club
Card).
P.C.
Card 
P.C.
Card (Professional
Club Card) est une carte privilège (carte de fidélité et de paiement) destinée
aux professionnels et qui leur permettra de recevoir des réductions et
avantages conséquents chez nos partenaires (Cf. www.the-proclub.com.), le but
pour nous étant de  booster le pouvoir d’
achat, et donc la motivation des professionnels, leviers essentiels dans le
développement de notre société, la découverte, la consolidation et / ou la
création des richesses et de  contribuer
à la fidélisation des clients, à l’ acquisition de nouveaux clients chez nos
partenaires.
Ressource première et essentielle dans la
création et la pérennisation des richesses, les professionnels et les
travailleurs, énormément sollicités par la société (sur le plan professionnel,
sociétal et privé), ne bénéficient presque jamais d’avantages et de facilités
qu’offre la société à d’autres catégories de personnes. Au contraire… Cette
situation faisant éclore du stress, du mal-être, des maladies, dévastatrices
autant pour ces derniers que pour les entreprises dans lesquelles ils
travaillent (baisse de productivité et d’efficacité), ne pouvait nous laisser
indifférent. Il devenait de plus en plus urgent d’agir et d’apporter des
solutions durables pour combattre ces maux en s’attaquant à leurs causes. C’est
ainsi qu’est née, sous le modèle de la « Social Business », l’idée de la carte
P.C. Card qui vous est fièrement proposée par Bimbia, et qui en ce
moment est en pleine phase de développement.

ANALYSE
DES RISQUES
Il s’agit ici des aléas
mesurables, inhérents aux états de la nature au sein de laquelle l’entreprise
mènera ses activités. L’objectif ici est de recenser ces différents aléas, les
analyser, dans le but de les ‘‘maîtriser’’ en indiquant comment parer à leurs
éventuelles survenances. Trois principaux types de risques peuvent impacter
négativement la capacité de Bimbia Sarl à mener à bien ses objectifs. Ce sont pour
le moment le risque commercial et le risque politique (ou risque pays).
LE RISQUE
COMMERCIAL
C’est principalement, la
probabilité de ne pouvoir réaliser par Bimbia Sarl, les objectifs commerciaux
qu’elle a prévu de réaliser. Il s’agit notamment des objectifs relatifs aux
chiffres d’affaires indiqués dans le compte d’exploitation prévisionnel
  Niveau de risque : Moyen.
Un marché formel dans notre cœur de
métier n’étant pour le moment pas encore constitué, le nous comptons user de
stratégies afin de  mettre sur pieds un
modèle de commercialisation très favorable à l’attrait à la  fidélisation de la clientèle.
Pour se prémunir de toute mauvaise
éventualité, nous veillerons à assurer un management de qualité, qui motive
suffisamment son personnel et qui soit orienté vers l’atteinte du résultat.
Cela passera également par un recrutement non complaisant, pour assurer le
professionnalisme, qui est un important critère de satisfaction de la
clientèle.
LE RISQUE PAYS OU
RISQUE POLITIQUE.
C’est la probabilité de survenance
d’un évènement sociopolitique susceptible d’entraver le développement de la P. C.
Card sur son premier sol. Il peut s’agir d’un soulèvement social suivi d’actes
de vandalisme susceptibles d’entrainer le pillage de Bimbia Sarl, d’une guerre
civile, d’un coup d’état militaire qui entraineraient des limitations de
change, de transferts et paiements internationaux…

There is a lot to finish!</b></div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">The purpose of this campaign is to complete, and release, the <b>Confidence System</b> in the form of a Core Rule Book. This book will be set in a setting called <b>DeepFall</b>. This is only the first book in a series of setting books I hope to release for this system. </div><div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The confidence system is different from a lot of systems because instead of putting the focus on character's abilities it puts the focus on the character’s state of mind. Whether or not the character feels happy, fulfilled or alert defines their ability to succeed. Confidence is used in this system as a wagering device. when you succeed at doing something you retain your confidence, when you fail, you lose it.</span><br/>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The goal of this game is to create a more dynamic system for role-playing.</span><br/>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><b>Below is a breakdown of the contents of the book</b></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">The book will be fully self contained and will not require any other games or expansions to play. The system is comprehensive enough as to encompass any genre or style of play but is simple enough to allow for a smooth and pleasurable RPG experience. DeepFall, a fully fleshed out setting, is included in the book but does not demand full attention from the system. Instead, the system can be entirely independent of the setting.</div><div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Character construction is simple and expansive and allows for the creation of anything from a small child to a senior citizen and from human, or animal, to a 'god'. </div><div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">The book contains a truly massive equipment section covering more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at. The list includes narcotics and consumables, equipment (from clothing to particle accelerators), traditional and modern weapons - including a highly comprehensive set of rules for realistic firearms, vehicles of every variety and rules for shelters and HQ's. </div><div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">A fully equipped magic system that includes rules for spell creation on the fly (a spell can be made in under 1 min) along with rules for 'dark magic' and its effects on humans and supernatural beings. The system includes rules for permanent and temporary magical items as well as power boosting through a number of means, some with serious consequences. </div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">DeepFall</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">: The Cradle of the Forest is included as the first of a series of settings to be released for this system.

<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>DeepFall is a small town with a population of roughly 15,000 people. The town sits on a large island at the centre of a large lake. The city has had a spotty
history to say the least. It was founded in 1732 by a group of people who had
supposedly just up and left their old town, the location is unknown and most
find the idea silly. Why, after all, would anyone just up and leave a perfectly
good town?<p></p>
<p></p>
</div><div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">DeepFall is replete with supernatural events from the mythological to the bizarre. it lies on a locus of sorts, a tear in the fabric of reality. Leaking from that tear is a dark force called Entropy. Entropy is worshiped by a cabal of madmen called the Entropic Order:</div><div><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">The Entropic Order are a radical group of terrorists bent on collapsing reality, They believe the universe was originally an infinite mass of chaos. Then something <i>really terrible</i> happened and the universe became consistent like it is now. They really don’t like this and spend all of their time trying to break down a boundary they call Restriction. </div><div>
<br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>The story of DeepFall begins at the <i>beginning</i> of it all. Below is an excerpt from the Entropic Orders holy book, the Tome of Tumult:</p>
<h3><b><i>The Infinity Instance</i></b></h3>
<p><b><i>Excerpt from the Tome of Tumult, translated by Dr. Thompson of Quantico.</i> </b></p>
<p><i>In the beginning there was the infinity instance. All was chaotic and nothing was constant. Infinite matter and energy in a state of pure, unadulterated, entropy. Long before the fabric of space and time came to be there was entropy. All was, yet nothing was. All time in an instant. All was, and thus, nothing was. </i></p>
<p><i>It was in this infinity instance that all and nothing ceased to be. Within a single instant an infinite chorus of voices cried out for an end to chaos. The infinite thoughts demanded coherency. They created the logic circuit. </i></p>
<p><i>The logic circuit sent a shockwave of coherency through the tumult and the realm of entropy was shattered into the finite shards of reality. These shards formed the Five Essences of Consistency. </i></p>
<p><i>The First Essence was Consciousness, for thought is a consistency. </i></p>
<p><i>The Second Essence was Firmament, for substance must be vessel to Consciousness and matter is a consistency.</i></p>
<p><i>The Third Essence was Instance, for cause must have an effect and time is a consistency.</i></p>
<p><i>The Fourth Essence was Restriction, for ‘what is’ is a consistency. </i></p>
<p><i>The Fifth Essence was Entropy, for what is not can never be. </i></p>
<p><i>All reality came to be and consciousness found vessel and space found time. All was constant, all was coherent. </i></p>
<p><b>End of translation. </b></p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Core Book will include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A complete guide to playing a Human of any age or any <i>Supernatural</i> creature you can imagine.</li>
<li>A full magic system including the making of temporary and permanent magical items.</li>

<div>
<div>
<p>Confidence is the central trait of the Confidence System as it can be wagered in any check in the game. It represents the characters mental and emotional well-being and their ability to apply themselves in any task. When someone has low confidence they have lost some of that self-efficacy and feel like they are not emotionally capable of making change in the world. When you have a high confidence you feel powerful and self-assured. Remember, though, that confidence is a double edged sword. Using confidence to bolster a roll can be risky. The more you wager, the more likely the roll is to succeed. This also comes with a very serious risk. If you fail a check in which confidence has been wagered, then that confidence is lost, and fatigue is gained. </p>
<p>Confidence is used as a wager. Add as many points as you want, and have, to any roll at all as a one-to-one bonus. If you pass, you retain them, if you fail you lose them. Confidence is gained by expressing your Obsession and lost when experiencing your Fear. When confidence is wagered and an Outstanding success is achieved an extra point of Confidence is earned.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fatigue is your
body telling you to stop. You subtract fatigue from every roll. A fatigue point
is gained when Confidence OR Health is lost. They are all removed, regardless of
how few, or how many, after 6 hours of rest and a meal. If less than 6 hours of
sleep is had the number of fatigue is halved instead of removed entirely. If a
meal is <b>not</b> had the character
retains all fatigue until the character eats. Every time you <b>either</b> lose points of Confidence <b>or</b> points of Health <b>no matter how many points you lose or gain</b>,
respectively, you <b>gain a point of
fatigue </b>to a maximum of 10. No one can become more fatigued than that
regardless of the status of either Confidence or Health.</p>
<p>People, real
people, experience life not only through achievement but also though emotion.
There are few people who go through life without even one fascination. In this
system they are called Obsessions and represent the aspect of your character
that seeks out, blindly and with abandon, pleasure and contentment. No other
task, no matter how seemingly fulfilling, can offer the level of catharsis as
your character’s Obsession. </p>
<p>Vice versa all
people are terrified of something, often something relatively specific. This is
your character’s Fear and represents the thing that saps the life and vitality
from your character. </p>
<p><b>In game terms:</b> Confidence is gained by
expressing your <b>Obsession</b> and lost
when experiencing <b>Fear</b>. </p>
<p></p>
<h2><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Obsession</a></h2>
<p><b>Obsession</b> is your
characters raison’d'etre, their purpose for being. There are five central types
of Obsessions: <b>Knowing</b>, <b>Feeling</b>, <b>Consuming</b>, <b>Creating</b>, <b>Destroying</b>. Each represents a
fundamental human nature, desire or purpose. </p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Knowing</a></h4>
<p>can be as simple as
learning about others emotions or secrets, or investigating a crime scene. Conversation
is an easy way to fulfill this Obsession, reading a book or studying various
topics are also good ways. </p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Feeling</a></h4>
<p>Feeling is a
tactile experience but can also be emotional. This Obsession relates to the
need to be touched, held, loved or simply wanted, to feel euphoric. This can be
accomplished through a plethora of means. Viewing art, listening to music,
dancing, acting, watching TV, etc. </p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Consuming</a></h4>
<p>Consumption regards,
the desire to, obviously, eat but also encompasses the raw absorption of matter
or “energy”. While knowing and feeling does not deplete things, consuming must
deplete something: food, money. </p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creating</a></h4>
<p>Creation is the act
of forming something new out of the surrounding world. It can be emotional,
intellectual, spiritual or physical. The act of creating must result in an
object, it does not have to be important, created through the process of
regaining confidence. </p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Destroying</a></h4>
<p>As its name would
imply, Destruction regards the act of disassembly. This Obsession drives the
character to dissect the world back into its component parts. Destroying is not
necessarily an evil or cruel act. A child pulling wings off flies is simply an
act of science. Thus, often times, scientists fall under the category of
destroying more than knowing. <b>Destruction
is innately violent but no truly violent acts, especially on the helpless, can
gain confidence. It requires a level of psychopathic behavior to gain
Confidence from Harming humans, for that see Cruelty under Natures.</b> However,
sports like boxing or mischievous behaviors like destruction of property are
admissible Obsessions, hell, even bar fights and hunting. </p>
<p>These Obsessions
are generalized and each player will have to choose a specific circumstance or
situation where it takes effect. For example, Sarah’s character has an Obsession
of Feeling. She likes to feel excited and energized so she decides her
character needs to go dancing and partying with others in order to regain
Confidence. So when her Confidence is low she can go to a night club for a
while and regain her spent Confidence points. </p>
<p>This process, of
enacting your character’s Obsession, provides one point of confidence per hour
of performing your Obsession. </p>
<h2><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fear</a></h2>
<p>Experiencing Fear
is not pleasant. It can wreak havoc on the nervous system and weaken the will. Fear
represents your character’s weakness embodied. There are five types of Fear
including: <b>Loneliness</b>, <b>Violence</b>, <b>Failure</b>, <b>Truth</b> and <b>The</b> <b>Unknown</b>. </p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Loneliness</a></h4>
<p>This is a
character’s Fear of solitude. When your character is confronted by absence they
are forced to confront all the things in themselves they want to avoid. This
could be the absence of friends, of beloved possessions, of absence from a specific
place. All these constitute Loneliness. </p>
<h4>
<a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Violence</a>  </h4>
<p>Is a terrible
thing. It forces us to confront our mortality and comprehend the true extent of
pain and suffering. This Fear is perhaps the most obvious, though some people
respond to Fear more intensely than others, those who are truly terrified of
violence suffer simply from seeing it. Obviously, this can make a combat
oriented game difficult but can also offer a strangely interesting experience
as your character must “look away from the blood” and “run and duck for cover”
whenever a fight breaks out. The more dependent the character is on the person
or thing, that they desire the presence of, the more severe the effect. The
more accustomed the character is to, temporarily, not being around the person
or thing and the likelihood of seeing it again effects the “distance” modifier.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Failure</a></h4>
<p>Failure is the
absence of success. When the player with this Fear fails an objective, <b>not simply a roll</b>, then the player
suffers Fear. This does not mean a player who fails an attack roll must make a Perception
check. It relates to much larger scale plans and goals like asking someone out
you have had your eye on for some time or to have a book deal rejected. Losing
a game or a possession through self-inflicted means like a poker game. When
your character wants to get something done it is a very serious ordeal and
Failure can be the scariest thing imaginable. The severity modifier is
self-explanatory: the more the character wants to succeed; the more sever the
failure. The distance modifier is defined by the danger related to failure. So
if your character can lose something, money, property, the love of a friend, or
anything of any remote value then the Fear will be more intense. Losing keys
for example is not as serious unless the car is lost with them. Or you are
stuck in a bad part of town, late at night, and your keys just fell down a
drain. This situation can obviously insight a lot of Fears but that is how Fear
works. </p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Truth</a></h4>
<p>Represents the
world as it really is. The darkness that exists not only in the supernatural
but also in humanity itself. To experience this truth in any manor is
terrifying. Your character Fears this truth. Whether that truth is about
themselves or something beyond them, finding out it exists is terrifying. This
is perhaps the most difficult Fear to understand but can result in some very
interesting character personas. The distance modifier represents the quantity
of information gained by the moment of truth. The severity represents the
magnitude and un-believability of said truth. </p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">The
Unknown</a></h4>
<p>Is not definable by
virtue of its very nature. When a character, who possesses this as their Fear,
is confronted by concepts, beings, object or places that defy explanation or understanding
they suffer Fear. The unknown can be as simple as “where do we go from here” or
as complicated as the Fear of something that has never happened and likely
never will. A character with this Fear can activate the Fear simply by thinking
of something upsettingly hard to comprehend. Distance represents the literal
proximity to the unknown, hearing about it versus seeing it and, of course,
experiencing it. The magnitude is a measure of awareness compared to the
unknown. Being locked in a dark room alone with no memory of getting there is
much more serious a representation of the unknown than getting lost on your way
to work.</p>
<h3><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Effects of Fear</a></h3>
<p>Suffering your <b>Fear</b> causes your character to lose a
number of confidence equal to the severity of the Fear. Unlike Obsessions the
character does not choose a specific circumstance in which the fear occurs.
Instead the Fear occurs in varying levels of severity depending on the
circumstance. If Sarah’s character is most afraid of Violence and then watches
as a werewolf tears a human to pieces, she must take a Fear check and possibly
be terrified out of her Confidence points. Fear severity can be calculated by
taking into account the clarity of the Fear, the importance of the subject of
the Fear <b>compared with</b> the level of
involvement of the character. The character must then make a Perception check
consisting of: Perception Resistance with any current Confidence the character
chooses to spend on the roll. The number of successes are subtracted from the
effect of the Fear. </p>
<br/>
<div>The game is built on a system of traits and talents. Traits are fundamental qualities of a characters being where Talents are learned skills. Talents seriously effect the characters ability to use equipment. Checks are performed by adding various combinations of Traits and Talents along with bonuses from equipment (or penalties) and rolling handfuls of six sided dice. Every roll can be effected by two main qualities: Confidence, which can be selectively used to enhance rolls; and Fatigue, which is subtracted from all rolls. in order to regain confidence the character must express their obsession. To reduce fatigue the character need only eat and sleep. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Confidence is regained through the expression of an obsession. these obsesions can, essentially, be anything.</span>
</div>
<div>Combat is simple, based on competitive rolls between the attacker and defender. Health and Fatigue are inextricably bound so one hit can change the game as both characters tire from the fight and succumb to their wounds. </div>

</div></div>","Welcome to DeepFall by The Confidence System, an entirely new Role playing system geared towards emotion based gaming. View the current draft of the Core Rule book here. There is a lot to finish!The purpose of this campaign is to complete, and release, the Confidence System in the form of a Core Rule Book. This book will be set in a setting called DeepFall. This is only the first book in a series of setting books I hope to release for this system. 


The confidence system is different from a lot of systems because instead of putting the focus on character's abilities it puts the focus on the character’s state of mind. Whether or not the character feels happy, fulfilled or alert defines their ability to succeed. Confidence is used in this system as a wagering device. when you succeed at doing something you retain your confidence, when you fail, you lose it.

The goal of this game is to create a more dynamic system for role-playing.
Below is a breakdown of the contents of the bookThe book will be fully self contained and will not require any other games or expansions to play. The system is comprehensive enough as to encompass any genre or style of play but is simple enough to allow for a smooth and pleasurable RPG experience. DeepFall, a fully fleshed out setting, is included in the book but does not demand full attention from the system. Instead, the system can be entirely independent of the setting.Character construction is simple and expansive and allows for the creation of anything from a small child to a senior citizen and from human, or animal, to a 'god'. The book contains a truly massive equipment section covering more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at. The list includes narcotics and consumables, equipment (from clothing to particle accelerators), traditional and modern weapons - including a highly comprehensive set of rules for realistic firearms, vehicles of every variety and rules for shelters and HQ's. A fully equipped magic system that includes rules for spell creation on the fly (a spell can be made in under 1 min) along with rules for 'dark magic' and its effects on humans and supernatural beings. The system includes rules for permanent and temporary magical items as well as power boosting through a number of means, some with serious consequences. 
DeepFall: The Cradle of the Forest is included as the first of a series of settings to be released for this system. (Below is one of the Fabric Maps given as a reward for some of the Perks to the right)






DeepFall is a small town with a population of roughly 15,000 people. The town sits on a large island at the centre of a large lake. The city has had a spotty
history to say the least. It was founded in 1732 by a group of people who had
supposedly just up and left their old town, the location is unknown and most
find the idea silly. Why, after all, would anyone just up and leave a perfectly
good town?

DeepFall is replete with supernatural events from the mythological to the bizarre. it lies on a locus of sorts, a tear in the fabric of reality. Leaking from that tear is a dark force called Entropy. Entropy is worshiped by a cabal of madmen called the Entropic Order:The Entropic Order are a radical group of terrorists bent on collapsing reality, They believe the universe was originally an infinite mass of chaos. Then something really terrible happened and the universe became consistent like it is now. They really don’t like this and spend all of their time trying to break down a boundary they call Restriction. 


The story of DeepFall begins at the beginning of it all. Below is an excerpt from the Entropic Orders holy book, the Tome of Tumult:
The Infinity Instance
Excerpt from the Tome of Tumult, translated by Dr. Thompson of Quantico. 
In the beginning there was the infinity instance. All was chaotic and nothing was constant. Infinite matter and energy in a state of pure, unadulterated, entropy. Long before the fabric of space and time came to be there was entropy. All was, yet nothing was. All time in an instant. All was, and thus, nothing was. 
It was in this infinity instance that all and nothing ceased to be. Within a single instant an infinite chorus of voices cried out for an end to chaos. The infinite thoughts demanded coherency. They created the logic circuit. 
The logic circuit sent a shockwave of coherency through the tumult and the realm of entropy was shattered into the finite shards of reality. These shards formed the Five Essences of Consistency. 
The First Essence was Consciousness, for thought is a consistency. 
The Second Essence was Firmament, for substance must be vessel to Consciousness and matter is a consistency.
The Third Essence was Instance, for cause must have an effect and time is a consistency.
The Fourth Essence was Restriction, for ‘what is’ is a consistency. 
The Fifth Essence was Entropy, for what is not can never be. 
All reality came to be and consciousness found vessel and space found time. All was constant, all was coherent. 
End of translation. 

The Core Book will include:

A complete guide to playing a Human of any age or any Supernatural creature you can imagine.
A full magic system including the making of temporary and permanent magical items.
Includes a fully fleshed out setting, DeepFall: The Cradle of the Forest.
An easy to use system that puts the characters state of mind before their abilities.




Confidence is the central trait of the Confidence System as it can be wagered in any check in the game. It represents the characters mental and emotional well-being and their ability to apply themselves in any task. When someone has low confidence they have lost some of that self-efficacy and feel like they are not emotionally capable of making change in the world. When you have a high confidence you feel powerful and self-assured. Remember, though, that confidence is a double edged sword. Using confidence to bolster a roll can be risky. The more you wager, the more likely the roll is to succeed. This also comes with a very serious risk. If you fail a check in which confidence has been wagered, then that confidence is lost, and fatigue is gained. 
Confidence is used as a wager. Add as many points as you want, and have, to any roll at all as a one-to-one bonus. If you pass, you retain them, if you fail you lose them. Confidence is gained by expressing your Obsession and lost when experiencing your Fear. When confidence is wagered and an Outstanding success is achieved an extra point of Confidence is earned.

Fatigue is your
body telling you to stop. You subtract fatigue from every roll. A fatigue point
is gained when Confidence OR Health is lost. They are all removed, regardless of
how few, or how many, after 6 hours of rest and a meal. If less than 6 hours of
sleep is had the number of fatigue is halved instead of removed entirely. If a
meal is not had the character
retains all fatigue until the character eats. Every time you either lose points of Confidence or points of Health no matter how many points you lose or gain,
respectively, you gain a point of
fatigue to a maximum of 10. No one can become more fatigued than that
regardless of the status of either Confidence or Health.
People, real
people, experience life not only through achievement but also though emotion.
There are few people who go through life without even one fascination. In this
system they are called Obsessions and represent the aspect of your character
that seeks out, blindly and with abandon, pleasure and contentment. No other
task, no matter how seemingly fulfilling, can offer the level of catharsis as
your character’s Obsession. 
Vice versa all
people are terrified of something, often something relatively specific. This is
your character’s Fear and represents the thing that saps the life and vitality
from your character. 
In game terms: Confidence is gained by
expressing your Obsession and lost
when experiencing Fear. 

Obsession
Obsession is your
characters raison’d'etre, their purpose for being. There are five central types
of Obsessions: Knowing, Feeling, Consuming, Creating, Destroying. Each represents a
fundamental human nature, desire or purpose. 
Knowing
can be as simple as
learning about others emotions or secrets, or investigating a crime scene. Conversation
is an easy way to fulfill this Obsession, reading a book or studying various
topics are also good ways. 
Feeling
Feeling is a
tactile experience but can also be emotional. This Obsession relates to the
need to be touched, held, loved or simply wanted, to feel euphoric. This can be
accomplished through a plethora of means. Viewing art, listening to music,
dancing, acting, watching TV, etc. 
Consuming
Consumption regards,
the desire to, obviously, eat but also encompasses the raw absorption of matter
or “energy”. While knowing and feeling does not deplete things, consuming must
deplete something: food, money. 
Creating
Creation is the act
of forming something new out of the surrounding world. It can be emotional,
intellectual, spiritual or physical. The act of creating must result in an
object, it does not have to be important, created through the process of
regaining confidence. 
Destroying
As its name would
imply, Destruction regards the act of disassembly. This Obsession drives the
character to dissect the world back into its component parts. Destroying is not
necessarily an evil or cruel act. A child pulling wings off flies is simply an
act of science. Thus, often times, scientists fall under the category of
destroying more than knowing. Destruction
is innately violent but no truly violent acts, especially on the helpless, can
gain confidence. It requires a level of psychopathic behavior to gain
Confidence from Harming humans, for that see Cruelty under Natures. However,
sports like boxing or mischievous behaviors like destruction of property are
admissible Obsessions, hell, even bar fights and hunting. 
These Obsessions
are generalized and each player will have to choose a specific circumstance or
situation where it takes effect. For example, Sarah’s character has an Obsession
of Feeling. She likes to feel excited and energized so she decides her
character needs to go dancing and partying with others in order to regain
Confidence. So when her Confidence is low she can go to a night club for a
while and regain her spent Confidence points. 
This process, of
enacting your character’s Obsession, provides one point of confidence per hour
of performing your Obsession. 
Fear
Experiencing Fear
is not pleasant. It can wreak havoc on the nervous system and weaken the will. Fear
represents your character’s weakness embodied. There are five types of Fear
including: Loneliness, Violence, Failure, Truth and The Unknown. 
Loneliness
This is a
character’s Fear of solitude. When your character is confronted by absence they
are forced to confront all the things in themselves they want to avoid. This
could be the absence of friends, of beloved possessions, of absence from a specific
place. All these constitute Loneliness. 

Violence  
Is a terrible
thing. It forces us to confront our mortality and comprehend the true extent of
pain and suffering. This Fear is perhaps the most obvious, though some people
respond to Fear more intensely than others, those who are truly terrified of
violence suffer simply from seeing it. Obviously, this can make a combat
oriented game difficult but can also offer a strangely interesting experience
as your character must “look away from the blood” and “run and duck for cover”
whenever a fight breaks out. The more dependent the character is on the person
or thing, that they desire the presence of, the more severe the effect. The
more accustomed the character is to, temporarily, not being around the person
or thing and the likelihood of seeing it again effects the “distance” modifier.
Failure
Failure is the
absence of success. When the player with this Fear fails an objective, not simply a roll, then the player
suffers Fear. This does not mean a player who fails an attack roll must make a Perception
check. It relates to much larger scale plans and goals like asking someone out
you have had your eye on for some time or to have a book deal rejected. Losing
a game or a possession through self-inflicted means like a poker game. When
your character wants to get something done it is a very serious ordeal and
Failure can be the scariest thing imaginable. The severity modifier is
self-explanatory: the more the character wants to succeed; the more sever the
failure. The distance modifier is defined by the danger related to failure. So
if your character can lose something, money, property, the love of a friend, or
anything of any remote value then the Fear will be more intense. Losing keys
for example is not as serious unless the car is lost with them. Or you are
stuck in a bad part of town, late at night, and your keys just fell down a
drain. This situation can obviously insight a lot of Fears but that is how Fear
works. 
Truth
Represents the
world as it really is. The darkness that exists not only in the supernatural
but also in humanity itself. To experience this truth in any manor is
terrifying. Your character Fears this truth. Whether that truth is about
themselves or something beyond them, finding out it exists is terrifying. This
is perhaps the most difficult Fear to understand but can result in some very
interesting character personas. The distance modifier represents the quantity
of information gained by the moment of truth. The severity represents the
magnitude and un-believability of said truth. 
The
Unknown
Is not definable by
virtue of its very nature. When a character, who possesses this as their Fear,
is confronted by concepts, beings, object or places that defy explanation or understanding
they suffer Fear. The unknown can be as simple as “where do we go from here” or
as complicated as the Fear of something that has never happened and likely
never will. A character with this Fear can activate the Fear simply by thinking
of something upsettingly hard to comprehend. Distance represents the literal
proximity to the unknown, hearing about it versus seeing it and, of course,
experiencing it. The magnitude is a measure of awareness compared to the
unknown. Being locked in a dark room alone with no memory of getting there is
much more serious a representation of the unknown than getting lost on your way
to work.
Effects of Fear
Suffering your Fear causes your character to lose a
number of confidence equal to the severity of the Fear. Unlike Obsessions the
character does not choose a specific circumstance in which the fear occurs.
Instead the Fear occurs in varying levels of severity depending on the
circumstance. If Sarah’s character is most afraid of Violence and then watches
as a werewolf tears a human to pieces, she must take a Fear check and possibly
be terrified out of her Confidence points. Fear severity can be calculated by
taking into account the clarity of the Fear, the importance of the subject of
the Fear compared with the level of
involvement of the character. The character must then make a Perception check
consisting of: Perception Resistance with any current Confidence the character
chooses to spend on the roll. The number of successes are subtracted from the
effect of the Fear. 

The game is built on a system of traits and talents. Traits are fundamental qualities of a characters being where Talents are learned skills. Talents seriously effect the characters ability to use equipment. Checks are performed by adding various combinations of Traits and Talents along with bonuses from equipment (or penalties) and rolling handfuls of six sided dice. Every roll can be effected by two main qualities: Confidence, which can be selectively used to enhance rolls; and Fatigue, which is subtracted from all rolls. in order to regain confidence the character must express their obsession. To reduce fatigue the character need only eat and sleep. Confidence is regained through the expression of an obsession. these obsesions can, essentially, be anything.

Combat is simple, based on competitive rolls between the attacker and defender. Health and Fatigue are inextricably bound so one hit can change the game as both characters tire from the fight and succumb to their wounds. 






The prizes range from PDF documents and Books to a series of hand Dyed and Printed rewards including a hand dyed and screen printed Tote bag or T-shirt,




or, for something more specific to the system, a hand dyed and printed fabric map of the town of DeepFall or a Hand Made, Dyed and Printed dice bag with 15, 6 sided, dice as shown below.





The book crrently stands at 170 pages. My expectation is roughly 250 but it could be more if this is successful. I want to devote real time to this project bt to do it I need help. All funds raised in this campaign will be used to pay for editors, illustrators/ graphic designers and, of course, the all important play testers. The release date is tentative and based on funding. 
   


The greatest danger is not finding enough artists or illustrators to properly fill the book and give it that sense of realness that all role players desire in their rule books. If this is the case I will have to make the images myself like I did with the maps and images for the video.

<p>* By adopting The Room’<span>s puzzles and deduction elements made Hints and answers change each time you play</span></p>
<p>*<span>  </span>By adopting Five Night at Freddy’<span>s scary, </span>create an atmosphere of terror for game surroundings much darker and horrible</p>
<p><span>* </span>And  Various actions to survive crisis situations</p>

</div></div>","We at Erocona are here with the scariest game “Merendam2”. It is well-made ‘Room Escape” game as well as previous game “Merendam1 ” Please take a look all of the things we’ve made, we hope you to support our project!!



  A mobile adventure horror game set in creepy surroundings where your objective is to escape a ghost infested village that is isolated and deserted. You will need to use your wits and keen observation skills to figure out the proper tools you need and decipher clues. . As you can see in the video ghost comes out randomly, if you deal with the proper action you can escape from ghost not dead.




Several images













The rectangle shaped village. In the outside of spot, there is an old Korean traditional house. There is a widespread rumor ghost haunts which result in all of the people living leaves after Eun-jin dies. Not only did the girl damage, also the pianist, girl ghost did. Yu-ha and So-dam didn’t escape and lived in a house which had been kept ancestrally.In conclusion, they got involved in a ghost accident and the house has been trackless and deserted since then.





Merendam2 starts in an earlier timeline than Merendam1. In a decaying town, deserted and ghostly, two sisters are the last ones left nearby. Find out the new challenges and how the stories twisted. In the gloomy and spooky environment, you'll wander through every locked door and have to solve using all shabby tools.




  We are inspired the following both of games. We reflected Integrated and strengthened elements of well-made games from each genre
* By adopting Limbo’s simple side scroller layout, Optimized UI that flexibly changes according to the environment.
* By adopting The Room’s puzzles and deduction elements made Hints and answers change each time you play
*  By adopting Five Night at Freddy’s scary, create an atmosphere of terror for game surroundings much darker and horrible
* And  Various actions to survive crisis situations



The concrete game-play

(Merendam 1 play shot)
*  At first page, there are options for languages, you are able to select


(Merendam 1 play shot)

* There come up the red and blue circle to your movement. Drag your character in a left or right direction. The smaller circle means that there are paths nearby.

(Merendam 1 play shot)
* To obtain some items means that they should be used properly to play the game.



(Merendam 1 play shot)
* Anyone cannot expect when, where ghosts appear thus be always ready to keep your mind awake and move your fingers actively. .
 * The best way to master this game perfectly is that you solve all passwords at unlocked doors. In the process, you will need to exert your memory exploring the game. Every number all around buildings can be a hint.





  She is 15 years old girl and wearing in simply modernized hanbok that is Korean traditional cloth. She had basically spiritual ability but couldn’t see the ghost for a while. As grown up as a very little girl, she has gotten an ability to see the ghost. Yu-ha who has different spiritual ability accepted yin energy and have nightmare surrounded by the ghost. She is Yu-ha's younger sister.





  she seems to be extremely having much anxiety due to her weak sister. She who doesn’t have that strong psychic ability is not able to see a ghost. She was overwhelmed by the ghost and dispirited spiritually by the ghost around Yu-ha. She had owned estates for generations. Being a successor of authentic culture, she made kinds of potteries.


  Died at 11 years old and an orphan no parents. She was adopted from an orphanage but it was intended trick for being supported. There was not existed caring or affection for the little girl. A teddy bear was the only one friend who was beside her at an abused atmosphere. Internal organs get slipped under a suspender skirt. She was not meant to be violent but her character has been wilder and aggressive immediately after influenced by Eun-jin. She has the strong attachment to the teddy bear and is mischievous.



  17 years old and the first victim who was killed of being possessed by evil spirit. After Eun-jin dies, people also left the village. She walks twisting her body and Iron plates are stuck in head. The Results of aiming at Eun-jin were that eyes were sunken and mouth got ripped exposing muscles. She hates living things and attempts to kill them.






  She was killed by falling lightings from  a stage. Her skull was dented and a brain is seen. Something like fragments seems to be stuck in. Originally, she was blond curly hair but changed into is filled with lots of knots and tangles and a body is covered in blood. She was so ambitious that she wanders heavens still. The main places are her music academy she operated and practiced. The Piano sound is resounded softly in a deserted piano academy. An unrealized dream makes her have loads of grudges and living things become an object of hatred for her. Because of Her act of brutality,  all people living in that village could not help but run out of their home and Eun-jin was possessed  to be killed by a ghost.

        Within the game, non-technical players get gradually introduced to concepts of

<p style=""color: #2A2A2A;font-size: 16px;"">
        By exploiting unsecure connections and seeing how virtual citizen's data is
        fragile, we hope to show how <em>our own </em>privacy is at risk. We try to encourage the use of VPN, proxies, encryption
        and secure connections. The FBI will probably hate us for that.

<p style=""color: #2A2A2A;font-size: 16px;"">
        In the future we plan to launch a special version/modification to bring

        Having the opportunity to submit a small improvement to a game that person

<h2 style=""font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:5px;"">Schedule &amp; delays
      </h2>
<p style=""color: #2A2A2A;font-size: 16px;"">
         
        One of the biggest challenges any software project faces are delays, and its
        no different for us. We ourselves made a few time estimation mistakes in the
        past, but we've learned our lesson.
      </p>
<p style=""color: #2A2A2A;font-size: 16px;"">
        The way we plan to minimize the chances of having the project delayed is, 
        among other alternatives, to be very specific about features and project 
        scope, define the right success metrics and have constant feedback between 
        developers and users. 
      </p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:5px;"">Software quality
      </h2>
<p style=""color: #2A2A2A;font-size: 16px;"">
        Having a below-expectations release is common among software, and handing 
        you a low-quality game is the last thing we want. 
      </p>
<p style=""color: #2A2A2A;font-size: 16px;"">
        The previous mitigation techniques described previously also apply for software 
        quality. Constant feedback with the community is key here. An additional 
        factor here is developer quality. And even though we are young, we are 
        confident that our knowledge is more than enough to develop and manage a 
        project of this size.
      </p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:5px;"">Open source trumps them all
      </h2>
<p style=""color: #2A2A2A;font-size: 16px;"">
        Hacker Experience 2 is being developed in the open. You can see what we are 
        working on, and the actual code that is being written. This increases overall confidence and allows 
        for constant feedback between players, contributors and developers, a key aspect on mitigating all those risks.
      </p>
<p style=""color: #2A2A2A;font-size: 16px;"">
        The open license of Hacker Experience 2 gives you an additional benefit. 
        If we fail to deliver the project, for whatever reason,
        the community can pick up from where we left off and finish it. Rest assured that's 
        not something we plan for, but it is good to know that the worst-case scenario
        isn't total loss.

              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">No. Hacker Experience 2 is designed from scratch to be an inclusive game. You don't need any specific knowledge about computers, <em>and</em> you will end up learning some stuff about them.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Is it illegal? Am I hacking real servers?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">No. The whole game is virtual and you will be hacking ""made up"" servers from other players.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">What will I learn while playing HE2?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">You will grasp concepts of computer networks, operating systems and computer security. Stuff like VPN, Proxy, HTTPS, DNS and encryption won't have an obscure meaning anymore. By eavesdropping data from virtual people, you will probably get more worried about your real privacy. You won't learn how to hack a computer in real life.</span>

              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Yes. We will provide official support for English and Portuguese, and we welcome community translations.

<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Is Hacker Experience 2 a ""pay-to-win"" game?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">No, and it will never be. Everyone plays by the same rules, with strategy, tactics and skill being the game-defining factors. It is possible to buy custom themes for the game, but nothing that provides tactical advantages over others.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">What is HEOnline?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">HEOnline is the official game server provided by Neoart Labs, the company sponsoring Hacker Experience. It allows you to play online against thousands of other players.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Is HEOnline subscription based?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">You can choose whichever is best for you: pay monthly or only once for your HEOnline account.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">How much does HEOnline cost?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">For the final release we expect to have a monthly subscription of $5 and a lifetime account for $30. Prices may vary slightly if we have unexpected servers and taxes expenses (or savings). Preorder and crowdfunding prices are much lower given the risk and early access factors.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Can I get an HEOnline account for free?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Yes. We are quite generous to contributors, so a nice way to get an HEOnline account for free is by helping us build HE2. Sounds a great deal, right? Check <a href=""https://letsbuildagame.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">letsbuildagame.org</a> for more information on how you can help. We also plan to add ""play-to-pay"" in the future. This means you can extend your subscription by paying in-game money.</span>
<h2 style=""display: block;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:10px;padding:10px 0 0 0;"">Development</h2>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Can I help with HE2 development?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Yes, please! You can help even if you have no idea how a computer works. Please visit <a href=""https://letsbuildagame.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">letsbuildagame.org</a> for more information.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">What is ""Let's build a game""?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Let's Build a Game is a project to bring collaborators and players together to work on creating a collaborative game. We want to provide a low barrier to entry project for first-time contributors. Please visit <a href=""https://letsbuildagame.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">letsbuildagame.org</a> for more information.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">What programming languages do you use in HE2?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">HE2 is made of several different software, which include languages like Elixir, Python, Ruby, Elm, F#, Bash and PL/pgSQL. We also rely on tools like Postgres, PostGIS, Mapserver, nginx, Elasticsearch, Mnesia, Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Docker, Aerospike and many others.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">What is HE2 software license?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">HE2 is made of several software. The core (server) and all client interfaces are released under the AGPLv3 license. All supporting libraries created by us are either MIT or MPL-licensed.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Is HE2 a free software?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Yes, HE2 is a free software, as defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). You have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Please notice that the <em>free</em> in ""free software"" means <em>freedom</em>, not necessarily <em>gratis</em>.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Is it possible to play HE2 for free?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Yes, you can play HE2 without paying a dime. In order to be able to play for free, you must host the server software yourself. It's not as technically challenging as it seems, and we are still here to help you :) However, it does require a relatively powerful computer. As an alternative, you can use HEOnline to play against thousands of other players without worrying about setup.</span>
<h2 style=""display: block;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:10px;padding:10px 0 0 0;"">Crowdfunding</h2>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Why flexible funding?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Reaching the funding goal is great because it allow us to hire additional people and provide a higher-quality game under a tight schedule. However, we are working openly on Hacker Experience 2 and have plans to keep doing so even if the campaign fails. In that case, it would mean it will take <em>longer</em> to finish the game, but it won't stop us from working on it. Therefore, an all-or-nothing funding isn't the best alternative, since the ""nothing"" part is not an option for us :-)</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Why $50,000? Why not more, or less?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">We feel the $50,000 goal is a balanced option that gives our team enough stability to keep working full time on HE2. It also allow us to hire additional people to help us meet the expected schedule. Less money is able to keep our current team working on the game, but not to hire new people. This delays the project, but it still exists, hence flexible funding. More money gives us more security about the schedule and game quality. It would be great, but it is not essential.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Why don't you offer physical rewards?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">We are a small team with an already busy schedule. We believe it's better to focus on actually building HE2 instead of having shipping and production headaches. Though we agree swag merchandise would be awesome...</span>
<h2 style=""display: block;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:10px;padding:10px 0 0 0;"">Systems Requirements</h2>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Does it run on... ?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Yes! Ubiquity is one of the principles that powers the game. You can run it on your Windows, Mac or Linux operating system. You can also play it on most modern browsers. A native app is coming for WP, iOS and Android devices. You can even play it over telnet! In the future we want to support a wider set of systems, including VR gear and videogame consoles.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">What are the hardware requirements?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">It's too soon to tell with accuracy the final hardware requirements, but given that the entire game logic runs on the server, your computer will probably handle the game smoothly.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">How about iOS/Android versions?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">We still don't know for sure which versions will be supported :-(</span>
<h2 style=""display: block;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:10px;padding:10px 0 0 0;"">Hacker Experience 1 (Legacy)</h2>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">What is Hacker Experience 1?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Hacker Experience 1 (HE1) is the first version of Hacker Experience, released in 2014. It currently has around 500,000 players and is quite addictive, according to some people. You can play it for free at <a href=""https://legacy.hackerexperience.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">legacy.hackerexperience.com</a>.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Will HE1 live alongside HE2?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">We have plans to support both versions. Once HE2 gets released, HE1 code will be made open source. We (Neoart Labs) will keep the servers running. We'll also assign to the project a couple of maintainers, who will accept community patches to fix bugs or release new features. Once HE1 gets open sourced we will remove all ads and premium will no longer exist.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">I have a premium account on HE1. Does it apply to HE2?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">Yes. If you bought a lifetime premium account on HE1, you will have a lifetime account on HE2 (HEOnline). If you bought 1 month of premium on HE1, you will have 1 month of HEOnline (HE2) subscription, and so on. This also applies to those who were awarded a premium account. Once HE2 gets released, if you still haven't received an access code, please send us an email.</span>
<li style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: bold;margin-top:15px;"">Can I use my HE1 account on HE2?
              </li>
<span style=""font-size: 14px;margin:5px 0 0 0;"">No. Given the differences between both systems, you'd need to create a new account. We also can't guarantee that your HE1 username will be available on HE2.</span>

Hacker Experience 2 is a massively multiplayer real time hacking simulation. You play the role of a hacker living in a dystopian 
        world controlled by megacorps.
      
The game brings location-based strategy to a persistent virtual open world enduring a digital war. 
        Claim and guard your territory against hackers and factions.
      

        Hack servers, eavesdrop connections, upgrade hardware, research 
        software, steal bank accounts, install viruses. All while trying not to be 
        traced by the FBI - or others. 
      
A virtual world just like ours
      
Hacker Experience 2 is based on a virtual reality of our worldwith thousands of simulated entities. They are persistent 
        virtual citizens living around virtual buildings.
      
Virtual citizens have name, home, family, job, bank account
        and even criminal records. Best part of all, they are hackable. Turn them 
        into a millionaire overnight, or frame and jail them.
      
Thanks to data from OpenStreetMap, we have virtual buildings located exactly where they really are. Think hotels, 
        business, banks, parks, schools and more. And of course they are hackable 
        :-)
      

        You can interact with buildings to hack the world around you! For example, the City 
        Hall and prison may contain valuable data about virtual 
        citizens from that city.
      
Mind-blowing missions
      

        Get paid to do dirty jobs for the megacorps. Join lonewolf or team missions 
        of industrial espionage, sabotage, capture-the-flag and many others.
      

        Frame virtual citizens or fellow hackers for fun and profit. Watch them get 
        caught on an international news system.
        
      
Access the Deep Web and join a wild PvP world of user-generated missions. 
      
Tailored gameplay
      

        Hacker Experience 2 offers a profound and endless gameplay with several 
        ramifications tailored by your character's decisions.
      

        Choose your strategy: attack all the way, fortify yourself and 
        counter-attack or be stealthy and cover your tracks. There are special game
        modes for each one.
      
Play good cop/bad cop or, in this world, be a white hat or black hat hacker. Fight the system or play by the rules. 
        Your actions shape your honor, and the game is presented to you accordingly.
      
Dominate your city
      

        Gather influence over your block, city or country. Every remote action 
        rewards you influence at the location it happened. Become the best hacker 
        in your region.
      
Engage into massive factions war
      

        Form alliances and develop your own team strategy. Engage into exciting 
        wars against multiple factions to conquer new territories and assert your 
        power.
      
Moving targets
      

        Play from your WP/iOS/Android phone and use mobility as your strategy. While 
        connected, your server is mapped in real time to your location and you can
        hunt nearby targets or access local missions.
      

        Another source of mobile attacks are virtual drones. Buy one and point them 
        to a location to scan for targets. But if someone hacks the drone 
        they might trace you!
      
Play on your terminal
      

        Play natively on your own terminal with CLI, shell 
        and ncurses-based interfaces. Use the tools you already love - awk, sed, grep and pipe - 
        for blazingly fast actions.
      
Play it over MOSH, SSH or, dare I say, telnet.
      
The above image is from a library from Yaron Naveh with the purpose of creating terminal-like interfaces. It is NOT part of the game, 
        but a prototype terminal would be very similar to the one above, and we'll likely use this library.
      
Create your own world
      
Customize the interface shown to you. Try user-uploaded or official modifications in a click.
      
Matrix theme
      

Tron theme
      
Both designs above are part of Patricio's work for Mapzen.
      
Customizing is dead easy
      
Really. With Tangram's Play, you can do it interactively.
      
Computer Science education
      

        We want to spread Computer Science education to young students around the
        world, with the ultimate goal of getting them interested in Computer Science.
        
      
Within the game
      

        Within the game, non-technical players get gradually introduced to concepts of
        computer networks, operating systems and security.
        
      

        By exploiting unsecure connections and seeing how virtual citizen's data is
        fragile, we hope to show how our own privacy is at risk. We try to encourage the use of VPN, proxies, encryption
        and secure connections. The FBI will probably hate us for that.
      

        In the future we plan to launch a special version/modification to bring
        programming languages to the game. The player would be able to extend his
        software, automate tasks and engage into ""coding wars"". And of course, learn
        while having fun.
        
      
And outside it
      

        Back to the real world, we aim to motivate non-technical players and
        students to contribute for the first time with projects like Let's build a game.
      

        Having the opportunity to submit a small improvement to a game that person
        actually plays can have a tremendous effect. Seeing the change being rolled
        out to others brings a great feeling that, we hope, will motivate further
        contributions.
        
      
We believe this practical experience will get more students interested in Computer Science, computer programming
        and open source projects.
      
A game for everyone
      

        We want to create a game for everyone, including those with disabilities. With
        help from the community, we plan to develop special interfaces crafted for them.
        
      
Ultimately, we want to provide HE2 to people like Jemil and James.

Free and open source software
        

          Hacker Experience 2 is a free and open source software being developed openly.
          This means the entire codebase that powers HE2 is public. As the user, you have 
          the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software.


Take action!
        

          We are more than happy to welcome community contributions. Ever

This is a tentative timeline. You can see it in more details at https://letsbuildagame.org




        The breakdown below includes the bare minimum of all expenses required to
        the final game release.
      




        * Indiegogo's fees are approximate and may be more or less depending on a 
        few factors. We also have no idea how much taxes we have to pay, so 10% is a 
        rough estimation and we could be way off here.
      
Game development expenses
      

        Take a look at the chart below for a breakdown of the game development 
        expenses, which totals 65% of the raised amount. We'd like to invest 100% 
        in it, but unfortunately there are taxes and other expenses that we must pay for.
      




        * If we hit the goal, we plan to hire at least one person to help on each of 
        these tasks. This additional help is required to meet the expected schedule 
        (Q4 2016).
      
Monthly expenses report
      

         
        Our team looks forward to total transparency. We will share each month how
        we are using the money raised here, with a detailed expenses breakdown.
      

        For our own safety, we won't share publicly how much each developer
        earns. Instead, we'll report the total sum of wages.
      
Democratic & open development
      

        Hacker Experience 2 is an open game, and you have a say on what it 
        becomes. Vote for or against new features or decisions in the game-making
        process. Learn more about our contribution & voting guidelines.



Here's an easy way to figure out what you'd receive based on your contribution.
        






          We are committed to implementing all of the following features as the game 
          development progresses, however this could take years. If we manage to meet 
          the goal requirements, we'll work hard to include these features with the 
          public game release, scheduled to December 2016.
          
        

          The price gap between one goal and the next one is the amount we feel is 
          required in order to fully develop, test and release that feature.
          
        




Schedule & delays
      

         
        One of the biggest challenges any software project faces are delays, and its
        no different for us. We ourselves made a few time estimation mistakes in the
        past, but we've learned our lesson.
      

        The way we plan to minimize the chances of having the project delayed is, 
        among other alternatives, to be very specific about features and project 
        scope, define the right success metrics and have constant feedback between 
        developers and users. 
      
Software quality
      

        Having a below-expectations release is common among software, and handing 
        you a low-quality game is the last thing we want. 
      

        The previous mitigation techniques described previously also apply for software 
        quality. Constant feedback with the community is key here. An additional 
        factor here is developer quality. And even though we are young, we are 
        confident that our knowledge is more than enough to develop and manage a 
        project of this size.
      
Open source trumps them all
      

        Hacker Experience 2 is being developed in the open. You can see what we are 
        working on, and the actual code that is being written. This increases overall confidence and allows 
        for constant feedback between players, contributors and developers, a key aspect on mitigating all those risks.
      

        The open license of Hacker Experience 2 gives you an additional benefit. 
        If we fail to deliver the project, for whatever reason,
        the community can pick up from where we left off and finish it. Rest assured that's 
        not something we plan for, but it is good to know that the worst-case scenario
        isn't total loss.

        Below is a list of common questions. If you are still uncertain about 
        something, don't hesitate to shoot us an email at contact@hackerexperience.com.
      
I'd tell you to call us but we are socially awkward and run away from ringing phones.
      

General
Do I need to have any technical knowledge in order to play HE2?
              
No. Hacker Experience 2 is designed from scratch to be an inclusive game. You don't need any specific knowledge about computers, and you will end up learning some stuff about them.
Is it illegal? Am I hacking real servers?
              
No. The whole game is virtual and you will be hacking ""made up"" servers from other players.
What will I learn while playing HE2?
              
You will grasp concepts of computer networks, operating systems and computer security. Stuff like VPN, Proxy, HTTPS, DNS and encryption won't have an obscure meaning anymore. By eavesdropping data from virtual people, you will probably get more worried about your real privacy. You won't learn how to hack a computer in real life.
Can you hack this facebook account? Pretty please?
              
No, we can't. And this is a frequent question. Sigh.
What are the main game features?
              
This is quite an answer. Please visit hackerexperience.com for the full set of features.
Will the game be translated to other languages?
              
Yes. We will provide official support for English and Portuguese, and we welcome community translations. If you want to help us translate the game to your language, or improve existing translations, please visit letsbuildagame.org for more information.
Is Hacker Experience 2 a ""pay-to-win"" game?
              
No, and it will never be. Everyone plays by the same rules, with strategy, tactics and skill being the game-defining factors. It is possible to buy custom themes for the game, but nothing that provides tactical advantages over others.
What is HEOnline?
              
HEOnline is the official game server provided by Neoart Labs, the company sponsoring Hacker Experience. It allows you to play online against thousands of other players.
Is HEOnline subscription based?
              
You can choose whichever is best for you: pay monthly or only once for your HEOnline account.
How much does HEOnline cost?
              
For the final release we expect to have a monthly subscription of $5 and a lifetime account for $30. Prices may vary slightly if we have unexpected servers and taxes expenses (or savings). Preorder and crowdfunding prices are much lower given the risk and early access factors.
Can I get an HEOnline account for free?
              
Yes. We are quite generous to contributors, so a nice way to get an HEOnline account for free is by helping us build HE2. Sounds a great deal, right? Check letsbuildagame.org for more information on how you can help. We also plan to add ""play-to-pay"" in the future. This means you can extend your subscription by paying in-game money.
Development
Can I help with HE2 development?
              
Yes, please! You can help even if you have no idea how a computer works. Please visit letsbuildagame.org for more information.
What is ""Let's build a game""?
              
Let's Build a Game is a project to bring collaborators and players together to work on creating a collaborative game. We want to provide a low barrier to entry project for first-time contributors. Please visit letsbuildagame.org for more information.
What programming languages do you use in HE2?
              
HE2 is made of several different software, which include languages like Elixir, Python, Ruby, Elm, F#, Bash and PL/pgSQL. We also rely on tools like Postgres, PostGIS, Mapserver, nginx, Elasticsearch, Mnesia, Apache Kafka, Apache Samza, Docker, Aerospike and many others.
What is HE2 software license?
              
HE2 is made of several software. The core (server) and all client interfaces are released under the AGPLv3 license. All supporting libraries created by us are either MIT or MPL-licensed.
Is HE2 a free software?
              
Yes, HE2 is a free software, as defined by the Free Software Foundation (FSF). You have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Please notice that the free in ""free software"" means freedom, not necessarily gratis.
Is it possible to play HE2 for free?
              
Yes, you can play HE2 without paying a dime. In order to be able to play for free, you must host the server software yourself. It's not as technically challenging as it seems, and we are still here to help you :) However, it does require a relatively powerful computer. As an alternative, you can use HEOnline to play against thousands of other players without worrying about setup.
Crowdfunding
Why flexible funding?
              
Reaching the funding goal is great because it allow us to hire additional people and provide a higher-quality game under a tight schedule. However, we are working openly on Hacker Experience 2 and have plans to keep doing so even if the campaign fails. In that case, it would mean it will take longer to finish the game, but it won't stop us from working on it. Therefore, an all-or-nothing funding isn't the best alternative, since the ""nothing"" part is not an option for us :-)
Why $50,000? Why not more, or less?
              
We feel the $50,000 goal is a balanced option that gives our team enough stability to keep working full time on HE2. It also allow us to hire additional people to help us meet the expected schedule. Less money is able to keep our current team working on the game, but not to hire new people. This delays the project, but it still exists, hence flexible funding. More money gives us more security about the schedule and game quality. It would be great, but it is not essential.
Why don't you offer physical rewards?
              
We are a small team with an already busy schedule. We believe it's better to focus on actually building HE2 instead of having shipping and production headaches. Though we agree swag merchandise would be awesome...
Systems Requirements
Does it run on... ?
              
Yes! Ubiquity is one of the principles that powers the game. You can run it on your Windows, Mac or Linux operating system. You can also play it on most modern browsers. A native app is coming for WP, iOS and Android devices. You can even play it over telnet! In the future we want to support a wider set of systems, including VR gear and videogame consoles.
What are the hardware requirements?
              
It's too soon to tell with accuracy the final hardware requirements, but given that the entire game logic runs on the server, your computer will probably handle the game smoothly.
How about iOS/Android versions?
              
We still don't know for sure which versions will be supported :-(
Hacker Experience 1 (Legacy)
What is Hacker Experience 1?
              
Hacker Experience 1 (HE1) is the first version of Hacker Experience, released in 2014. It currently has around 500,000 players and is quite addictive, according to some people. You can play it for free at legacy.hackerexperience.com.
Will HE1 live alongside HE2?
              
We have plans to support both versions. Once HE2 gets released, HE1 code will be made open source. We (Neoart Labs) will keep the servers running. We'll also assign to the project a couple of maintainers, who will accept community patches to fix bugs or release new features. Once HE1 gets open sourced we will remove all ads and premium will no longer exist.
I have a premium account on HE1. Does it apply to HE2?
              
Yes. If you bought a lifetime premium account on HE1, you will have a lifetime account on HE2 (HEOnline). If you bought 1 month of premium on HE1, you will have 1 month of HEOnline (HE2) subscription, and so on. This also applies to those who were awarded a premium account. Once HE2 gets released, if you still haven't received an access code, please send us an email.
Can I use my HE1 account on HE2?
              
No. Given the differences between both systems, you'd need to create a new account. We also can't guarantee that your HE1 username will be available on HE2.",48.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Overview</b></h3>
<div>Koko Monsters is an action-based fitness RPG on mobile which encourages players to exercise regularly while being on an adventure. Available in both online and offline modes, players travel between real world locations and the virtual world of Koko Monsters to battle against monsters. Collect hundreds of monsters and form your dream team through training, evolution, and trading!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Story</b></h3>
<div>A portal in the world of Koko Monsters has opened up, allowing monsters to freely access the human world. However, not all monsters are friendly. As the protector of both realms, you must battle against destructive Boss Monsters and subdue them to bring peace again.</div>
<div>

<p>Your character will differ in size based on the amount of exercise you complete in the real world. We're talking about sit-ups, push-ups, walking and running! Our game is able to track your exercise status (using a co-processor of your phone) and reward you accordingly.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Monsters</b></h3>
<p>Start off the game by selecting a starter monster, and begin to explore the real world and virtual world to complete missions. Through missions, you are able to capture and train monsters, and collect items. You can evolve your team using specific items.</p>

Koko Monsters is an action-based fitness RPG on mobile which encourages players to exercise regularly while being on an adventure. Available in both online and offline modes, players travel between real world locations and the virtual world of Koko Monsters to battle against monsters. Collect hundreds of monsters and form your dream team through training, evolution, and trading!

The Story
A portal in the world of Koko Monsters has opened up, allowing monsters to freely access the human world. However, not all monsters are friendly. As the protector of both realms, you must battle against destructive Boss Monsters and subdue them to bring peace again.

 




Your Character
Choose between 6 different characters to represent yourself.


Your character will differ in size based on the amount of exercise you complete in the real world. We're talking about sit-ups, push-ups, walking and running! Our game is able to track your exercise status (using a co-processor of your phone) and reward you accordingly.


So keep fit and your monsters will gain better stats! We currently have 4 designated exercises, but we are open to making changes to accommodate our players' preferences. 

The Monsters
Start off the game by selecting a starter monster, and begin to explore the real world and virtual world to complete missions. Through missions, you are able to capture and train monsters, and collect items. You can evolve your team using specific items.


There is over a hundred monsters to be discovered and captured. Each monster has its unique set of skills from one of 5 elements: Light, Fire, Water, Grass, and Dark.







The Virtual World







The Virtual World consists of 5 lands representing each of the 5 elements. In these lands, you can complete different missions to obtain monsters and items.

Our current story spans 3 chapters. In each chapter, you will explore the 5 lands, and complete 10 stages within each land.

Each stage will have at least 5 rounds of battle. You are able to catch or fight the monsters you encounter here. The shorter the time taken to complete each stage, the greater the rewards you gain. 
Battle Screens:


*** You are able to play in the virtual world without any network connection.
Bonus!
We have plans for a special Evil Land in the Virtual World. where more Boss monsters reside. However, depending on the funding outcome, we will decide on whether to release it in the upcoming version. 
* Below are screenshots of an older version of the game.




The Real World

Go on an epic adventure in the world you are most familiar with - your own! You are presented with a GPS map to explore cities and towns of where you live and even around the globe. Capture as many monsters as you can; certain monsters reside exclusively in the real world.


As you move around, you can click the Radar icon to scan your surroundings for monsters. Venture to interesting places, such as museums and monuments, where you can collect rare items.
Some monsters will only appear in certain places. For example, some Fire-type monsters appear only in tropical countries. 

Although you don't have to be physically present in most areas to encounter monsters (yes, you can search for monsters in France even while you are in Singapore!), our game requires you to be physically present in key areas, such as Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, to meet exotic monsters. You can also use the chance to convert your steps walked into precious coins in the game!
So remember to keep an eye out while travelling overseas!


Fitness
Our game on your mobile phone (iPhone/Android) can track your exercises such as Sit-ups, Push-ups and Running. In the training gym, you are able to train and increase your monsters' stats by doing the exercises. 

*Below are screenshots of an older version of the gym.




Also, as walking is a simple yet effective exercise, the game will be using the data of iPhone's co-processor or Android's Step Sensor to convert your steps into coins and experience points. 
(*Recommended to use iPhone 5s and above, Android Samsung S3 or Nexus for best performance in calculating your steps.)




How will your contributions be used? 





A majority of the initial $50,000 will go into developing the game, with the exception of the 8% we need to pay Indiegogo and PayPal, and 25% to fulfil merchandising rewards. We will be using the funds to complete other areas of production, such as creating assets, QA and localization.
After accounting for pre-production and ramp-up time, the full budget will support a spending rate of around $10,000/man-month - this includes employee salaries, benefits, office rent, utilities, equipment, legal costs, and all other business overhead. 

The Alpha Version





We began working on the alpha version of the game in Nov 2015. Between salaries for the core staff, art contracting, programming costs with core processor, we spent around USD 55,000 which was provided by an angel investor. 
With this amount of money, we made an abstract game idea more concrete for backers, but there is still a lot we’d like to accomplish in the final game that we weren’t able to do in this version:





Game balance


Creation of environments and characters


Music and sound effects


Animation of game assets, and skill effects


Social (PvP and Guild) features 


Staffing
We are a tiny team and we need all the help we can get to hire more programmers and artists to bring the game to completion.
Timeline





At Kookoo Studios, we not only build engaging mobile applications, but we are committed to advocating healthy lifestyles. We gamify fitness to make exercise a little less boring and a lot more fun!

<h3>WHAT IS NINE TO FIVE ABOUT?</h3>
<p><strong>Nine to Five is a game based off of regular, every day life.</strong> Located on a fictional US island called Santa Vida, the players will find themselves on the journey to build the life they want. Whether you want to buy a yacht, build your dream house, become famous, have a farm of cats, make pies, build a UFO on wheels, start a lawn mower racing group, or any other crazy, wonderful you can think of, you can live out your wildest dreams in Santa Vida. </p>
<p><strong>But to make those dreams come true, what do you need most?</strong> The resource the whole world is after. Money. Hence the name ""Nine To Five"". Because this game is all about the jobs you will have as you fund your dreams. But hey, sometimes the dream is all about the job anyways, right? </p>
<p><strong>So what kind of jobs do we offer? </strong>You can start as a deputy and work your way up through the police department, or you can be a criminal and rob your way to the top. That all sounds pretty familiar though, doesn't it? There are tons of cops and robbers game already </p>
<p><strong> ...Good thing we aren't one of them!</strong> Some of the other jobs we will have include Firefighters, Coast Guard, Doctors &amp; Nurses, Dentists, Chefs, Farmers, Vets, Pet Groomers, Zoo Keepers, Biologists, Marine Biologists, Mechanics, Hair Dressers, Fashion Designers, Mayors, Judges, US Marshals,Tattoo Artists, CSI's, and SO MANY MORE to come! Our goal is to try and bring as many possibilities as we can see in real life, into our game.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535362412/qkx9cxt8g4slprezit6o.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION</h3>
<p><strong>We don't stop at the job options.</strong> We are doing are best to ensure you can be as unique in our game as you are in real life. </p>
<p><strong>For example, our character creator has many morphing options so you can scale each part of your body to be the size and shape that you like.</strong> You can change your eye color, makeup, have a unique hair-color or hairstyle, choose from a large assortment of accessories including tattoos and piercings, and you will eventually be able to create your own custom clothes, accessories, make up and many other things with our included customization software - but more on that later! </p>
<p><strong>But we took it a step further. We are creating a system where you can actually make many facial expressions to react to the world!</strong> You will be able to chose which expressions you want to use and keymap them to your liking. You can smile, grimace, make a puke motion, blow a kiss, wink, and many more. This is personally one of our favorite features since many of the games we play are limited to a simple ""wave"".</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535362461/l2pul2djbejwk2061yfz.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>HOUSE CUSTOMIZATION</h3>
<p><strong>Self-expression goes beyond your appearance.</strong> You will also be able to customize your house down to the very fine details. If you buy a house, you can change the layout, the trim, the walls, the windows, the floors, the roof, the yard and much more. You can even build a house from scratch! If you rent an apartment instead, you can change everything except the layout. Create a nice accent wall. Or go for a new hardwood floor. You can make your room have metal walls or even put grass on your floor. Who are we to tell you how to live? We will give you the tools, and you do you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535362494/rsdbioriuqotpfhrc7an.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>JOB OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
<p><strong>You read above about all of the different job opportunities we plan to offer. But how do we plan on making them fun?</strong> We don't want any of these jobs to be just a title for the player accompanied by a few functions. We are going as in depth as possible with each job to replicate the functionality they have in real life along with giving the employee realistic tasks and realistic roles to fill. Things like ""picking a lock"" won't simply be a clickable option with a random % chance of success. It will require actual skill from you as the player, and your ability to follow prompts with your mouse and keyboard along with learning the right technique and the right combination to make certain things happen. Some tasks may almost feel like mini-games. The player will also be able to climb the chain and get promoted, earning unique skills on the way. Why do we do this? Because in real life, people have different skills and talents. Such as if you practice shooting your gun a lot, you will have better aim than someone who has just started doing it. We want to bring that level of realism and diversity to our game since it's all about real life. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535362537/thbmhia3w9ctfntrbkra.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Skills</h3>
<p><strong>All players are not the same.</strong> This is why we are fans of the good ol' skill system, but it is much different than what you're used to! We plan to make each job equipped with unique skills that you can not obtain without climbing the ranks of that job. For example, say you are a police officer and you are investigating a murder. You know who did it, but you have no proof, so the guy is going to walk free. Unless you have evidence. </p>
<p><strong>Luckily, there will be a CSI job in this game (super stoked for this).</strong> A CSI of a certain level, can effectively get finger prints off of crime scenes. (Don't worry criminals, there will be ways to get around it, but you have to level up as a criminal too or your chance of success at hiding your tracks is low!) If you were to know of a CSI who had obtained the skill to dust for prints successfully, you would most likely catch your criminal.</p>
<p><strong>Every way to make money will have parts where you could do better with someones help, but it is not required. </strong>There will be no need to grind to get skills because you can have a fulfilled experience without them, they are just a fun bonus!</p>
<h3>HOW SERVERS WILL OPERATE</h3>
<p><strong>We will have a few different game versions, in the same way FPS's have different game modes.</strong> For them, they have gun game, team deathmatch, capture the flag, etc. Our game modes or ""sever types"" will be called Classic, Open RP, and Community RP.</p>
<p><strong>Classic will be like GTA Online.</strong> It will have objectives , goals, skills, and be ran automatically and by AI. It will have a larger amount of players.</p>
<p><strong>Then there is Open RP. It will be an RP server, but no one is running it</strong>. It is a ""hop on and play"" type of thing. No rules, no admins, nothing. The difference between this type and the classic type, is that this type has no objectives or structure. People will get on needing to get food, shelter, money, etc, and will have to Role Play in order to get it. Why? Because there are some things in this game that will require special skills to achieve. Skills that take time to acquire, as referenced above. We believe this will give the relaxed, fun environment with no rules while still providing structure.</p>
<p><strong>Last is community Role Play.</strong> Most of us here now, are very familiar with this as it is what we all do already! Community RP is where you join a community, and have rules, stricter and more realistic RP, admins, support, application processes, elections for leaders, special events, and all of that other good stuff. This is not the type of game where you can land a helicopter on the highway or troll the police when they arrest you. These people mean business! </p>
<p><strong>We will have our own official servers </strong>but players may also host and run their own servers. Each server's combination of what is available will be up to each server owner and how they choose to customize their server. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535362602/odjvpablpf6elbvlgnqn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>DEFINE ""ROLEPLAY"" or ""RP""</h3>
<p><strong>Roleplay is a great type of game play</strong>. If you have never heard of Role Play or are new to it, let us better explain it to you. When you Roleplay, you are almost acting or improvising. Random encounters and interactions with other people come up and people ""play along"" with these actions essentially. </p>
<p>Say you are driving down the highway and you hit a person crossing the road. In a normal online game, most of you would ignore it and keep driving.<strong> In RP, every action has a reaction. </strong>Jobs are played out as if you are doing them IRL, injuries are treated like they are painful, and criminals get caught and punished (sometimes). There is good RP and there is bad RP.</p>
<p><strong>In an example of good RP</strong>, you would get out of your vehicle, see if the person was okay, and call an ambulance. They would most likely be making ""oooh"" and ""owwww"" noises as if they were hurt. They may decide to press charges on you in which case you would end up in court. This would lead to you needing to find a lawyer and make a good case for yourself. This kind of RP can be found on a Community RP server.</p>
<p><strong>In an example of bad RP</strong>, you would after hitting the person, back up and hit them again. That would lead to them calling the police which would put you at the front of a huge pursuit. If you knew the person, they could identify you, resulting in a warrant for your arrest. If you ever got caught you would not stand a chance in court and would most likely do jail time for felony evasion and a hit and run. Then, most of your RP would be focused in a jail making shanks, trading favors for commissary items, and trying to make an escape. This is not necessarily ""bad"" RP, it is just more ""troll-y"" and many communities like to keep it more realistic. This is of course the server owners choice. This kind of RP can more commonly be found on an Open RP server.</p>
<p><strong>RP can lead to some of the funnest gaming experiences you will ever have.</strong> If you want a lot of interaction with people, this is the way to go. If this isn't your thing? No worries! That is why we have classic mode where you play with AI's and objectives and have less heads on interaction with people, like GTA online. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHO ARE WE AS DEVELOPERS?</h3>
<p><strong>Most of our experience comes from what we have learned in college or university, and developing mods for Arma 3 servers, along with several little side projects.</strong> It involves the same type of map development, programming, animations, and scripting that you see in any other game, only it is much more limited due to Arma having very outdated tools and not being made to handle as much as we want it to. That is why we decided to make a standalone game. We have great ideas and plenty of talent to back them up, but we are too big for Arma and needed an engine that could handle all we had to offer. That is why we switched to UE4 and began making something new.</p>
<p><strong>Do we work with other developers? Absolutely!</strong> There are a few modelers whose content we found in the UE4 marketplace that we use, and we love their models so much, we have reached out to them for some custom work as well. We have two modelers of our own as well, but if we see something we love and we can use it - you better believe we are buying it! That saves our modelers time so they can be working on something else. All of the models we have purchased are modular items. Meaning you buy building parts, but you still have to build you items brick by brick - literally. We have made some amazing things with the modular pieces we have purchased so far. We are also looking to work with an animator to make custom animations in a motion capture studio so that they can be as realistic and unique as possible.</p>
<p><strong>These are the two main reasons why we require funding to continue much longer.</strong> To hire a great animator, and to be able to pay the modelers doing custom content to create new models for us! (Those, and of course keeping the ability to do this full time.) This is what is slowing us down the most right now! We feel we have come pretty far with funding it ourselves and getting what we couldn't make from the UE4 marketplace. But to continue, we'll need your help. </p>
<p><strong>We have spent the last 2 months showing you what we can do so you would not have to pledge blindly. </strong>(Project started on June 20th, 2018) Taking a look at what we have done so far, we have created a PD, hospital, zoo, aquarium, several furnished apartment buildings, a downtown shopping district, a custom morph character creator with both males and females, clothes made for each body type, made drive-able cars, made a police car with functioning lights and sirens, made all of the basic player movement abilities, animated all of our animals and fish, created dynamic materials that change with the weather, created a realistic day and night cycle, created a housing editor that allows you to change any material and the color of any material in your home, made a twitch plugin that works from any tv or pc screen, and we are still working on so much more right now. Again, two months. We did all of this in two months. We feel like this was a big accomplishment. Imagine what we will have done in two more months? Or by next summer? That is why we believe we can meet our estimated timelines. Good things take time. But they don't have to take 4 years if you work hard and love what you're doing. We don't quit when we're tired. We quit when we're done. (Screenshots of everything mentioned can be found in the progress tracker on our website as well as what we are working on right now.)</p>
<p><strong>We post screenshots of completed work on our discord daily and answer every question we are asked. We know you have trust issues, but we won't hurt you. &lt;3 You will be involved and updated every step of the way.</strong> We are so excited to show you what we have done that we couldn't keep it to ourselves even if we wanted to!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for hearing us out!</strong> If you'd like to back us, you can do so here! Thank you on behalf of all of us here at Nine to Five!

You know who did it, but you have no proof, so the guy is going to walk free. Unless you have evidence. 
Luckily, there will be a CSI job in this game (super stoked for this). A CSI of a certain level, can effectively get finger prints off of crime scenes. (Don't worry criminals, there will be ways to get around it, but you have to level up as a criminal too or your chance of success at hiding your tracks is low!) If you were to know of a CSI who had obtained the skill to dust for prints successfully, you would most likely catch your criminal.
Every way to make money will have parts where you could do better with someones help, but it is not required. There will be no need to grind to get skills because you can have a fulfilled experience without them, they are just a fun bonus!
HOW SERVERS WILL OPERATE
We will have a few different game versions, in the same way FPS's have different game modes. For them, they have gun game, team deathmatch, capture the flag, etc. Our game modes or ""sever types"" will be called Classic, Open RP, and Community RP.
Classic will be like GTA Online. It will have objectives , goals, skills, and be ran automatically and by AI. It will have a larger amount of players.
Then there is Open RP. It will be an RP server, but no one is running it. It is a ""hop on and play"" type of thing. No rules, no admins, nothing. The difference between this type and the classic type, is that this type has no objectives or structure. People will get on needing to get food, shelter, money, etc, and will have to Role Play in order to get it. Why? Because there are some things in this game that will require special skills to achieve. Skills that take time to acquire, as referenced above. We believe this will give the relaxed, fun environment with no rules while still providing structure.
Last is community Role Play. Most of us here now, are very familiar with this as it is what we all do already! Community RP is where you join a community, and have rules, stricter and more realistic RP, admins, support, application processes, elections for leaders, special events, and all of that other good stuff. This is not the type of game where you can land a helicopter on the highway or troll the police when they arrest you. These people mean business! 
We will have our own official servers but players may also host and run their own servers. Each server's combination of what is available will be up to each server owner and how they choose to customize their server. 

DEFINE ""ROLEPLAY"" or ""RP""
Roleplay is a great type of game play. If you have never heard of Role Play or are new to it, let us better explain it to you. When you Roleplay, you are almost acting or improvising. Random encounters and interactions with other people come up and people ""play along"" with these actions essentially. 
Say you are driving down the highway and you hit a person crossing the road. In a normal online game, most of you would ignore it and keep driving. In RP, every action has a reaction. Jobs are played out as if you are doing them IRL, injuries are treated like they are painful, and criminals get caught and punished (sometimes). There is good RP and there is bad RP.
In an example of good RP, you would get out of your vehicle, see if the person was okay, and call an ambulance. They would most likely be making ""oooh"" and ""owwww"" noises as if they were hurt. They may decide to press charges on you in which case you would end up in court. This would lead to you needing to find a lawyer and make a good case for yourself. This kind of RP can be found on a Community RP server.
In an example of bad RP, you would after hitting the person, back up and hit them again. That would lead to them calling the police which would put you at the front of a huge pursuit. If you knew the person, they could identify you, resulting in a warrant for your arrest. If you ever got caught you would not stand a chance in court and would most likely do jail time for felony evasion and a hit and run. Then, most of your RP would be focused in a jail making shanks, trading favors for commissary items, and trying to make an escape. This is not necessarily ""bad"" RP, it is just more ""troll-y"" and many communities like to keep it more realistic. This is of course the server owners choice. This kind of RP can more commonly be found on an Open RP server.
RP can lead to some of the funnest gaming experiences you will ever have. If you want a lot of interaction with people, this is the way to go. If this isn't your thing? No worries! That is why we have classic mode where you play with AI's and objectives and have less heads on interaction with people, like GTA online. 

WHO ARE WE AS DEVELOPERS?
Most of our experience comes from what we have learned in college or university, and developing mods for Arma 3 servers, along with several little side projects. It involves the same type of map development, programming, animations, and scripting that you see in any other game, only it is much more limited due to Arma having very outdated tools and not being made to handle as much as we want it to. That is why we decided to make a standalone game. We have great ideas and plenty of talent to back them up, but we are too big for Arma and needed an engine that could handle all we had to offer. That is why we switched to UE4 and began making something new.
Do we work with other developers? Absolutely! There are a few modelers whose content we found in the UE4 marketplace that we use, and we love their models so much, we have reached out to them for some custom work as well. We have two modelers of our own as well, but if we see something we love and we can use it - you better believe we are buying it! That saves our modelers time so they can be working on something else. All of the models we have purchased are modular items. Meaning you buy building parts, but you still have to build you items brick by brick - literally. We have made some amazing things with the modular pieces we have purchased so far. We are also looking to work with an animator to make custom animations in a motion capture studio so that they can be as realistic and unique as possible.
These are the two main reasons why we require funding to continue much longer. To hire a great animator, and to be able to pay the modelers doing custom content to create new models for us! (Those, and of course keeping the ability to do this full time.) This is what is slowing us down the most right now! We feel we have come pretty far with funding it ourselves and getting what we couldn't make from the UE4 marketplace. But to continue, we'll need your help. 
We have spent the last 2 months showing you what we can do so you would not have to pledge blindly. (Project started on June 20th, 2018) Taking a look at what we have done so far, we have created a PD, hospital, zoo, aquarium, several furnished apartment buildings, a downtown shopping district, a custom morph character creator with both males and females, clothes made for each body type, made drive-able cars, made a police car with functioning lights and sirens, made all of the basic player movement abilities, animated all of our animals and fish, created dynamic materials that change with the weather, created a realistic day and night cycle, created a housing editor that allows you to change any material and the color of any material in your home, made a twitch plugin that works from any tv or pc screen, and we are still working on so much more right now. Again, two months. We did all of this in two months. We feel like this was a big accomplishment. Imagine what we will have done in two more months? Or by next summer? That is why we believe we can meet our estimated timelines. Good things take time. But they don't have to take 4 years if you work hard and love what you're doing. We don't quit when we're tired. We quit when we're done. (Screenshots of everything mentioned can be found in the progress tracker on our website as well as what we are working on right now.)
We post screenshots of completed work on our discord daily and answer every question we are asked. We know you have trust issues, but we won't hurt you. <3 You will be involved and updated every step of the way. We are so excited to show you what we have done that we couldn't keep it to ourselves even if we wanted to!
Thanks for hearing us out! If you'd like to back us, you can do so here! Thank you on behalf of all of us here at Nine to Five!

<p>Hello, My name is Cyntiria Loc, Co-founder of Visionary Studios Co. of Jacksonville, Florida. I'm responsible for the business management of The Catalyst Action Series. Over the past few years, I've witnessed my husband Vince Loc develop the series from inception to the concept presented to you today. We've gone to various conventions and pitch festivals across the country and have garnered interest from patrons to producers. With the level of feedback we have received, I believe now is the time to elevate our products. You can be the support needed to introduce the fresh content people crave. Ranging from written and graphic literature to gaming, with an extension to film and animation.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need you to push past the concept phase. Over the last couple of years, we've garnered interest from consumers on multiple platforms. We are looking to raise $50,000 with this campaign. This will allow us to complete the production of our audiobook for the existing novels, finish the artwork for our Graphic Novel, ""Chronicle of The Grey,” and the Animation ""Blurred Lines” trailer.  Completing these various projects sets us up to present The Catalyst as a viable franchise to shop licensing agreements for further development &amp; merchandising. If we exceed our goal, we will be able to further pursue the development of our adventure video game, action figure toys, and enter preproduction on a film.</p>
<p>Our perks will include content from the story and merchandise we have designed to promote the series such as shirts, backpacks, poster prints, and other apparel.</p>
<p>When you help us reach our stretch goals we will be full steam ahead at completing each stage.<br/>$55,000 - If we are able to reach $55,000, we will proceed with the creation of The Catalyst Exclusive Clothing line for people of all ages. This means T-shirts and Accessories that will feature characters from the series.</p>
<p>$65,000 - At this goal, we will allow us to move forward with producing a playable Demo of our adventure/fighting game. We already began development with independent game designers/developers that are excited about creating a unique gaming experience and we look forward to licensing our game to different companies for further development.</p>
<p>$100,000 - It is no secret that our ultimate goal is to get this concept as a Feature Film that can be enjoyed on the big screen. Reaching this stretch goal will allow us the opportunity to develop a Quality Sizzle Reel and Trailer of The Catalyst Series</p>
<p>$150,000 - If this stretch goal is met, at this stage we will start mass-producing our action figure lineup of The Catalyst Main Characters.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

Recruit monsters and super powered bounty hunters in order to rebel against an oppressive government.At its core, Laxidaze is re-imagined monster taming RPG that captures what made the classics fun while expanding on customization and inclusivity. As a role playing game, Laxidaze features a diverse cast and an expansive character creator in order to better represent the player and create a more immersive experience to a wider audience.Hey everyone! We at Machine Elf Studios are committed to being transparent and honest with our supporters. So if you have any questions, send us a message or join our Discord server and ask us there! Laxidaze is set on Earth in the far future where city-states have replaced modern countries. Our story takes place in the region and city-state of Cascadia located on the Pacific Northwest of North America.Hammocks CityCascadia is governed and controlled by the largest corporation in the region, Nile Corp. Nile Corp is ruled by the seemingly benevolent but ruthless CEO, Mr. Baz and his ruthlessly cute Nanim, Zu.Although it began as a logistics company, Nile Corp's largest source of revenue comes from its production and maintenance of Nanobytes, microscopic robots that can perform the functions of organic cells and increase the rate of evolution in any organic/ inorganic matter they infect. The main character quits a soulless job at Nile Corp, in order to pursue something greater. They become a bounty hunter in the wasteland outskirts of Cascadia in order to fund a life for them and their friends. Chaos erupts when the extent of Nile Corp's abuses are revealed. Our heroes join the resistance against Nile Corp as the façade of their benevolence fades and their atrocities come to light.Laxidaze will feature real time 3rd person ability based combat. Weapons will each have their own respective abilities/move sets and can be either ranged or melee. Players will have a basic attack that charges their Nano-Meter (ability meter) and the players use these charges to perform various abilities. Real Time ModeEngage in real time combat to take down your enemies by using your weapons and abilities.Panzer Hunter using their ""Accelerator"" abilityTactical ModeTactical Mode allows you to slow things down and think through your strategy even in the middle of combat. Entering Tactical Mode slows down time within the game and allows you to select your target and your move.Engineer Class Hunter using Tactical ModeSummoningSummon Nanims to aid you in battle by using the Summoning Meter which gradually builds throughout the battle.Summoning DragmarSwitching CharactersThroughout the battle, you will be able to switch between your various Squad Mates and Nanims. When you control a different character you will have access to their full move set and combat will function the same. AbilitiesHunters and Nanims will have access to ability ""pools"" based on their class and type, and both being able to learn and unlearn moves.Nano Sync AbilitiesThese abilities are unique to each hunter and vary in function. The Player using their Nano Sync, ""Blink"" to dodge an enemyUltimate Abilities Every Hunter and Nanim in the game has access to Ultimate Abilities which are powerful moves that can completely change the tide of battle.Nanomancer using their Ultimate Ability, ""Strike Down""Boss BattleWhile bounty hunting, you may come across incredibly powerful and rare Bounty Hunters and Nanims. These will be the hardest battles in the game, so you’ll need to make sure your team is ready by building the toughest hunter team you can.EquipmentHunters in Laxidaze will have armor sets and weapons that can be customized depending on your upgrade materials. You will be able to unlock new armors and weapons.The Player selecting their equipment before a bountyRarity LevelsAll Hunters, Nanims, armor sets, weapons, etc. will follow this rarity scale:

Common (White)

Rare (Blue)

Epic (Purple)

Legendary (Orange)

Mythic (Galaxy FX)
Recruit Nanims and other bounty hunters to grow your team and tackle harder bounties.Hunter ClassesEvery Hunter in Cascadia falls into one of below Hunter Classes, each with their own set of armors, equipment, weapons, and skill trees.

Protean: The jack-of-all-trades, few exist in the world of Cascadia. This class can use any of the armors, equipment, or weapons from any of the other classes. 

Nanim Master: “Beast Master” type class, they specialize in befriending and battling with Nanims.
​
Engineer: “Tech” type class, they specialize in technical abilities as well as tech-focused weapons.​
Nanomancer: “Mage” type class, they focus on dealing elemental damage and excel at large area-of-effect attacks.
Panzer: “Tank” type class, they will have more defense-focused attributes while also being able to deal massive damage.
Phantom: “Assassin” type class, they specialize in stealth and high single target damage. Here's an example of a skill tree for the Engineer Hunter Class. Recruit Other Bounty HuntersIn your fight for Cascadia, you will need to expand your Hunter team to tackle harder bounties, help build up your community, and to aid you in freeing Cascadia.  Basic and Special TypesThere will be 6 basic types and 6 special types. The special types are themselves an evolution of the basic types (ice is an evolution of water). Cross types exist and have no restrictions, with a combination of flame and ice being possible.Recruit NanimsNanims are intelligent creatures that can be recruited to your party to aid you in battle, help you explore Cascadia, and aid you in developing your community. Nanims, like Hunters, have a friendship link that can be used to unlock new abilities and to evolve them to their next form.Use the profits from your bounties to manage and upgrade both your home and the community. Upgrading the community will allow you to access better equipment and unlock new areas. Hunters that have joined your team are available for community missions while they’re not currently part of your party. Community missions passively grant the player extra experience, money, and upgrades.Use your bounty rewards to upgrade your Home Base!Use your bounty rewards to help your community!Bounty HuntingAs an independent Bounty hunter, you’re willing to take on even the oddest of jobs in order to make money and collect rare rewards. Bounties are generally created by the citizens of Cascadia when Nile Corp refuses to provide the help and protection they’ve promised. As such, the bounties will widely range from defeating dangerous Nanims and regional warlords, to exploring new and perilous trade routes, and helping the community grow.Accept a Bounty from your Home Base!Before leaving on a bounty mission, select your personal Nanim Summons and select your Hunter Squad Mates.Select your Squad Mates and Nanims before a bounty!Once you're ready, get in the taxi and head on out on your bounty!On your bounty mission, you may come across helpful locals and maybe some not so helpful...Engage with the locals of Cascadia during your bountiesFight against dangerous Nanims throughout your bounty!Recruit Nanims that you have defeated in battle!Recruiting and befriending Stalag-MightCascadian Hunter LeagueThe Cascadian Hunter League (CHL) officially certifies and ranks Hunters. Access to Bounties largely depends on your Hunter rank, which lets the people of Cascadia know how capable you are. You can increase your Hunter rank passively by completing Bounties but in order to progress to the next rank, you will need to compete in an official CHL tournament against the strongest Hunter in the region.Join CHL Tournaments and fight against the top Hunters in regional tournaments to increase your Hunter rank.Explore the urban and wild landscapes of Cascadia and discover its many towns, wacky citizens, and hidden secrets.As you explore the many wild and dangerous areas of Cascadia, you will need to traverse its environments by climbing, swimming, ziplining, using Nanims, and solving puzzles to unlock new areas.During your exploration, you will come across various important resources (certain plants, precious metals) that can be harvested and be used in either trade, upgrades, or for your own private farm.In Laxidaze, our goal is create Nanims that are highly interactable, from bonding to fighting. Outside of battle, you will be able to ride, fly, and even pet Nanims! Fly throughout the wilds of Cascadia! Fly in Laxidaze!Ride Langskipper to long forgotten places in Cascadia!Ride on Langskipper!Ride on various Nanims in Laxidaze!Ride on all types of Nanims! EvolutionsNanims can be evolved once they satisfy whatever requirement that specific Nanim has. Some Nanims only need experience to evolve, while others may require you to increase their friendship link or to complete a specific quest for the Nanim. Watch as your Nanim evolves!Evolution paths vary across Nanims, with some Nanims having multiple evolutions, some having no evolutions, and some even having branching paths in their evolution.Branching Evolution Path for BoomblastTradingThere two main ways to trade Nanims and Hunters in Laxidaze, you will have the ability to trade with in-game NPCs, as well as being able to trade with friends through our online trading system. Chromas (Shiny Nanims)All Nanims will have color variations, typically based on the region you find them, which are called Chromas. Nanims can have more than one Chroma and each Chroma will have its own rarity level.Lockle is a Water type!Lockle and Chroma LockleAeos is a Legendary Nanim with Voltaic and Air Types!Aeos and Chroma AeosDialogue SystemIn Laxidaze, there are multiple ways of interacting and speaking with the locals of Cascadia. The level of interaction that you have with each character will depend on the significance of each character.For Squad Mates, you will have a wide range of interactions - from small, one line pieces of dialogue to fully voiced and animated conversations. Squad Mates will speak and interact with each other on missions, comment on mission objectives, and even engage in ongoing conversations as a third party.Yuki jumping into an ongoing conversation!For general interactions with NPCs, conversations will typically relate the NPC's mood and what they're thinking about, along with general Cascadia news and quest info.Talk to the locals!Squad MatesIn Laxidaze, you will encounter NPCs that you can recruit to your Hunter Team. Each recruitable NPC will have a specific skill that you can utilize to improve your home base and your community, ranging from farming improvements to upgrading your equipment.NPCs each have a friendship link that you can level up. The main group of Squad Mates will have their own quest line that you will need to progress to level up the friendship, while the secondary group of Squad Mates will level up through various tasks/dialogue options that the player receives. As you level up your friendship link with your Squad Mates, several changes will occur: you will gain the option to hangout with them, you will be able to romance them, and the Squad Mate will unlock new abilities, passives, and equipment (this will result in visual changes as well). Use the in game texting system to find out about upcoming Bounty missions and social hangouts!Text your Squad Mates about bounties and hangouts!Hangout with your Squad Mates to build your friendship links!Relax by the bar after a long day!Relax by the barRelax with your friends and have fun!Have a dance party with your friends!Dance with your friends!NanimsSince Nanims are recruitable Squad Mates, they also have friendship links that can be leveled up throughout the game. While all Nanims benefit from increasing their friendship links, some are able to evolve if their friendship link is high enough. Pet Luna!Pet FuegonPet Kapoki!Laxidaze will feature Co-Op and multiplayer modes similar to other monster taming games.PvE multiplayer Base GameWhile in game, you will be able to join and fight alongside your friends while they’re out doing a bounty in Laxidaze’s Co-Op “dungeons”.Co-Op Dungeon in Laxidaze!Future StateWhile Co-Op dungeons are in the base game, Player vs Player (PvP) multiplayer modes will make it to Laxidaze by either reaching our stretch goal or through future updates as we’re committed to bringing multiplayer to Laxidaze.Inspired by other RPGs, Laxidaze will feature a Calendar System that will control the day & night system and the flow of events. The Calendar System will affect things such as Nanim encounters, availability of missions, and random social encounters (hanging out or romancing squad mates).In addition to riding Nanims, you will be able to use a collection of vehicles, such as a hoverboard.Laxidaze will be composed by ZW Buckley. The soundtrack will be heavily influenced by acid jazz, lo-fi hip hop, and jazz. Check out Laxidaze's main theme, Summer Nights by ZW Buckley!

Summer Nights

Summer Nights (Late Night Edit)Laxidaze will feature a day night cycle and the in-game music will change to reflect that. Each environment will have two associated themes, a daytime version and a nighttime version. The music that plays at night will be heavily influenced by genres like lofi hip hop, vaporwave, and synthwave.

Crowdfunding as I've mentioned earlier is heavily dependant on promotion and we've failed at promoting ourselves to as many people as possible :( Only 272 individuals saw our campaign (of which I'm sure about 100 are just friends or colleagues of ours :P). Regardless of how hard I tried to promote our campaign, only a few saw it. No where near enough people to impact the success of our campaign. Most successful campaigns see visits in the tens of thousands.</p><p>I've sent countless emails &amp; posts to as many gamer related websites &amp; persons of interest. Fansites &amp; forums of eSport games like SMITE, League of Legends, Counter Strike, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, etc. As well as well known and lesser known Youtube &amp; Twitch personalities. Just by scrolling through my email sent folder I can see over 200+ emails sent &amp; forums/website registrations and thread postings. But, unfortunately, luck wasn't on our side at all.</p><p>Most forums are pre-moderated and my posts were deleted with a notice stating that they do not accept Crowdfunding promotion since they get many such posts and it would turn their forum into a spam of people posting campaigns of games and game related projects. Understandable and reasonable, no hard feelings there from us :) We tried at least :D</p><p>As for Youtubers &amp; Twitchers, well only 6 replied giving the same reasoning as above. The rest, well, I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't reply at all :( A simple 'no' would have sufficed or some kind of reply :)</p><p>So as you can see, for us it wasn't easy, I guess you have to be lucky to get as many people to see the campaign as possible to gain some sort of success.</p><p><b>So what now?</b></p><p>Considering that 272 is no where near enough people to tell us that our idea is good or bad, we've decided not to abandon the project yet. We're debating whether or not to release our project again on Indiegogo or Kickstarter but with a much smaller financial goal. We've also continued to go about looking through investors. We've put too much of our own time &amp; money into this project to drop it.</p><p>Especially with fyrestore nearing completiion, which will be a big step forward in this project. Maybe we'll use profits gained from fyrestore to fund fyrecamp into reality. Maybe we'll land another investor, maybe our second attempt at Crowdfunding will be fruitful, who knows, we're not giving up :) Not yet.</p><p><b>What about the few that did support our campaign?</b></p><p>You are not forgotten, and you <b>will</b> be rewarded for your contribution. If not through fyrecamp, you'll be compensated with a bonus from our fyrestore :) We've got a few ideas on what may be of interest. fyrestore is a 100% sure to be completed project so no worries about us disappearing :) Look forward to us contacting you individually and compensating you. Thanks for those few who did support us. Big thank you ^^</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">fyrecamp is an easy-to-use platform designed to offer gamers <strong>amazing rewards</strong><b> for their achievements</b> in competitive eSport Gaming. Our platform is for any gamer, casual or professional, beginner or veteran, as long as you play games such as <strong>League of Legends</strong>,<strong> DotA</strong>,<strong> Counter Strike</strong>,<strong> StarCraft</strong>,<strong> and other eSport games</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As gamers we felt that there could be better and more ways to reward gamers. It's nice to know I beat someone in a 1v1, it's nice to receive from time to time in-game items for beating an opponent... but... but what if you could feel like you're actually <b>earning on your game-time</b>? That you're getting something real for your achievements? Well... that's where fyrecamp delivers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">fyrecamp is powered by a virtual currency we created specifically for gamers.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We decided to do things this way because otherwise malicious players would abuse the system and try to clean players out of their fyrecoins in a single Matchup. <strong>It just sucks when you lose everything anyway</strong> :( This way you just pick yourself up after a loss and fight to win your coins back!</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Just keep on fighting!

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">For the <b>NA market </b>this means that <b>items in our shop</b> will be converted based on the rate above (<b>EU market</b> will have it's own fyrecoin rate which should be similar to the above). For example, a gamer mouse that costs in stores $100 will be in our shop for 2000<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1410258/files/20150423154420-fc_symbol.png?1429829060"" src="""" style=""""/> (<b>1:20</b>).

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-align: justify;"">fyrecoins can be purchased at our store as well but there will also be ways to </span><strong style=""text-align: justify;"">acquire them for free</strong><span style=""text-align: justify;""> such as joining </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">tournaments</span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">, events</span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">, using tokens, </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">unlocking achievements</span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">, and more.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Both the EU and NA will have similar set rates once we launch fyrecamp. For this campaign we are using the <strong>USD:fyrecoin rate</strong> which is set for the NA market. <b>EUR:fyrecoin rate</b> hasn't been set yet, but <strong>don't worry</strong>, we're looking to keep all rates as close to market conditions as possible.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong style=""text-align: justify;"">*JUST TO BE CLEAR*</strong><strong style=""text-align: justify;""> </strong><span style=""text-align: justify;""> Not to be confused with gambling. You can only fight for coins in <strong>your own</strong> matchup, you <strong>cannot bet</strong> on someone else's match. This isn't a gambling/betting platform. <strong>YOU fight</strong> for coins based on your own skills, strategy, and gameplay, and if you are good enough to beat your opponent, you will be rewarded. <strong>No unknown or risky variables</strong>.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430568199/fjphzgzazfa0dsdwd8bz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Also this is NOT a Pay2Win platform</b>. Someone with more fyrecoins does not have ANY advantages over someone with less coins. I personally <strong>dislike P2W</strong>. We will never have a P2W model as it doesn't work with our strategy at all nor does it benefit us in anyway. So you can relax now :D</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Of course, we will be <strong>working on anti-cheat/hack systems</strong> and putting a lot of our effort and financial resources into creating a secure platform to ensure minimal malicious behaviour. <strong>No one likes cheats or smurfs right?</strong> :)</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>fyrecamp Explained - More in-depth video about how it works.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>The whole idea</strong> is to make fyrecoins widely accessible with <strong>minimal burden</strong>, both physically &amp; financially, so that anyone can play without feeling like their bank accounts are being cleaned out or they have to work super hard to earn them. This also creates a more <strong>relaxed approach to competing for fyrecoins</strong>. In the end, you want to be getting rewards, not losing them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1411567/files/20150424052436-Where_What_Why.png?1429878276"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">fyrecamp <strong>began over a year ago</strong>, but back then it was still a <strong>rough &amp; unorganised</strong> idea. Over time, it began to develop into something more serious, something possible, something that we've began to invest our time &amp; money into <strong>making a reality</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We began by building our <strong>fyrestore</strong>. At first we wanted to build a store that would sell Gamer Gear and other gamer related items and afterwards we'd implement the ability to buy stuff using fyrecoins. During this time we decided to look for investors and had the team develop a working concept to present and hope to gain financial support, however, <b>it </b><strong>was difficult</strong>. Most investors I contacted had no idea about eSports, and since it is a relatively new market, albeit a rapidly growing one, they weren't sure about its future, and some even considered it a temporary trend. Most investors told us to find incubation programs to see whether this idea would even be accepted publically and then come back to them for financial support. They liked the idea, it made sense to them, but they just weren't sure enough about the eSports gaming market.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So, after a lot of discussion we decided that we should turn to <strong>Crowdfunding</strong>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1412964/files/20150424181600-Indiegogo_Logo.png?1429924560"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Especially because it allows us to directly communicate with you. Your support will tell us whether or not we are onto something here, and you can <strong>help us prove</strong> these investors wrong, that this isn't a trend, that there is <strong>potential</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As of now we have invested our time &amp; money into creating our <strong>fyrestore </strong>which should be <strong>available soon</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1420023/files/20150427150022-fyrestore_Main.png?1430172022"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""text-align: justify;"">However, in order for fyrecamp to become a <strong>fully functioning platform</strong> </span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">w</span><span style=""text-align: justify;"">e need to <strong>expand our team</strong> and obtain resources necessary to make it operational.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>We need:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>TEAM</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Additional Programers &amp; Developers
	<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Back-end &amp; Front-end Developers</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Technical Developers</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Graphic, UI/UX Designers</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Quality Assurance Testers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Software &amp; Services
	<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Licenses for various software</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Anti-Cheat tools/Security</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">fyrestore Sales Team
	<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Shop management</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Lawyers &amp; Accountants</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>MATERIAL</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Office Space</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Office Supplies &amp; Furnishing</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Workstations</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">a HUGE Coffee Machine to pull all-nighters :P</li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Warehousing</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Currently we're all working from home but if we expand fyrecamp's team we need to consider renting an office, this comes with additional costs. We also will have to pay for the dreaded taxes *<i>shivers</i>* and hire lawyers to ensure that everything is done by the book. We are not putting all the costs on you, <b>we ourselves are </b><strong>covering whatever costs we can</strong> to get as much as possible done :)</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am a stickler for <strong>quality services, products, and talent</strong>. I apply this same aproach to our team. We don't want to build a half-assed product that will come with tons of holes and problems, we want to hire a talented team of <strong>quality specialists that will build a powerful quality platform</strong>. Luckily I have access to very talented people due to my <strong>original career</strong> but they come at a price. I would rather pay more, and have less problems, then vice-versa, for obvious reasons :)</p>

The beta version of Standard fyrecamp (Tier 1) will be available to you <strong>within 2-3 months after the end of this campaign</strong>, with the full version of Standard fyrecamp ready 1-2mths after that.

Expect most features to be implemented within the first half a year after the end of this campaign. <b>EU will be the first to get fyrecamp with North America shortly after.</b> </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We chose <strong>flexible funding</strong> as development is split into 3 tiers. Each tier reached will deliver the product ready to use with the tier's features implemented. We really want to reach all 3 Tiers since it will turn fyrecamp into something you'll definitely like.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The final tier, or rather, the end of the first chapter will allow us to develop the fyrecoin API Payment system that will allow businesses to implement fyrecoins as a method of payment directly in their shops. <strong><span style=""text-align: justify;"">Most importantly, we'll</span></strong><span style=""text-align: justify;""><strong> begin developing anti-cheat systems and security</strong>.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">So what are tokens? Consider them as <strong>boosters</strong> for every matchup you battle in. When planning/setting up a Matchup, you can <strong>choose a token to ""boost"" various elements</strong> of the matchup (no no no :D don't worry, it doesn't give you an advantage over your opponent, it's not a P2W kind of thing, hear me out). By boosting various elements, I mean mostly the rewards you get from the matchup. For this campaign we've decided to release <strong>5 different tokens</strong> for you to use during your matchups. Setup the match, choose a fyrecoin, and then, if you want, you can <strong>apply a token boost</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Let me explain</strong> what each of the 5 does (we'll be adding <strong>more tokens in the future</strong>):</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One of our main concerns right now is <strong>operating in various countries</strong> throughout the EU &amp; NA.

We'll be hiring the appropriate legal &amp; financial teams necessary in order to allow smooth operation and to have everything done by the book. We've never had a multinational business before so it'll be a first for us ^^;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Cheaters &amp; Hackers</strong>, unfortunately, in the world of eSport Gaming (and not only eSports) they are present. Many companies and businesses have been fighting against them and joining together to create alliances that would battle these malicious people.

It isn't cheap to build a secure platform, and we don't know exactly how much it will be. It depends on how big your platform is and how many users use it.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

07/06/2015I know I've been silent for a while now, I thought to clear up what's been happening and why the silence.fyrecamp is not dead, nor has it been cancelled. Crowdfunding as I've mentioned earlier is heavily dependant on promotion and we've failed at promoting ourselves to as many people as possible :( Only 272 individuals saw our campaign (of which I'm sure about 100 are just friends or colleagues of ours :P). Regardless of how hard I tried to promote our campaign, only a few saw it. No where near enough people to impact the success of our campaign. Most successful campaigns see visits in the tens of thousands.I've sent countless emails & posts to as many gamer related websites & persons of interest. Fansites & forums of eSport games like SMITE, League of Legends, Counter Strike, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, etc. As well as well known and lesser known Youtube & Twitch personalities. Just by scrolling through my email sent folder I can see over 200+ emails sent & forums/website registrations and thread postings. But, unfortunately, luck wasn't on our side at all.Most forums are pre-moderated and my posts were deleted with a notice stating that they do not accept Crowdfunding promotion since they get many such posts and it would turn their forum into a spam of people posting campaigns of games and game related projects. Understandable and reasonable, no hard feelings there from us :) We tried at least :DAs for Youtubers & Twitchers, well only 6 replied giving the same reasoning as above. The rest, well, I'm kind of disappointed that they didn't reply at all :( A simple 'no' would have sufficed or some kind of reply :)So as you can see, for us it wasn't easy, I guess you have to be lucky to get as many people to see the campaign as possible to gain some sort of success.So what now?Considering that 272 is no where near enough people to tell us that our idea is good or bad, we've decided not to abandon the project yet. We're debating whether or not to release our project again on Indiegogo or Kickstarter but with a much smaller financial goal. We've also continued to go about looking through investors. We've put too much of our own time & money into this project to drop it.Especially with fyrestore nearing completiion, which will be a big step forward in this project. Maybe we'll use profits gained from fyrestore to fund fyrecamp into reality. Maybe we'll land another investor, maybe our second attempt at Crowdfunding will be fruitful, who knows, we're not giving up :) Not yet.What about the few that did support our campaign?You are not forgotten, and you will be rewarded for your contribution. If not through fyrecamp, you'll be compensated with a bonus from our fyrestore :) We've got a few ideas on what may be of interest. fyrestore is a 100% sure to be completed project so no worries about us disappearing :) Look forward to us contacting you individually and compensating you. Thanks for those few who did support us. Big thank you ^^

fyrecamp is an easy-to-use platform designed to offer gamers amazing rewards for their achievements in competitive eSport Gaming. Our platform is for any gamer, casual or professional, beginner or veteran, as long as you play games such as League of Legends, DotA, Counter Strike, StarCraft, and other eSport games.
As gamers we felt that there could be better and more ways to reward gamers. It's nice to know I beat someone in a 1v1, it's nice to receive from time to time in-game items for beating an opponent... but... but what if you could feel like you're actually earning on your game-time? That you're getting something real for your achievements? Well... that's where fyrecamp delivers.
fyrecamp is powered by a virtual currency we created specifically for gamers.

Collect fyrecoins by simply playing the games you already play and use them to buy rewards from our shop such as gamer gear (Razer, Steelseries, Logitech, Corsair, etc.), PC components, games (Steam, GOG, etc), and many other gamer related items. Consider them as points you receive from your achievements in battle that can be exchanged for real rewards.
There will be tons of ways to earn fyrecoins in fyrecamp. We'll start with:

Battle other gamers as you normally would but with the addition of gaining fyrecoins. That's it, not much else changes in your gaming routine. Only a few quick clicks to setup a match and fight to win... or join a tournament and battle it out to win bigger prizes.You will be able to find matchups & tournaments based on your level and preferences. You are in control.

There will also be various tournaments for you to join. Tournaments will be available for every level of gamer in as many games as possible with many different prize pools to choose from. Aim to win the tournament and walk out with rewards like large fyrecoin pools, tokens, gamer gear, or games! Our system is setup in such a way that as long as you reach the quarter-finals you'll be walking out with part of the reward. Each tournament will have different requirements or conditions to enter, everyone will find a tournament suited for them.

Businesses will be able to create & manage their own tournaments with our tools. There are extra options to control tournaments with, such as setting conditions & requirements, more control over who can join, and prize pool management. We have many interesting development plans that will help you build your brand and connect with gamers and fans in fyrecamp! Contact us to find out how you will benefit from this.

There will only be 4 coins to choose from when battling for fyrecoins. 2, 5, 10, and 20. Only 1 coin can be chosen per matchup. To play, just create a match, choose a coin, and battle it out, whoever wins takes the loser's coin.
We decided to do things this way because otherwise malicious players would abuse the system and try to clean players out of their fyrecoins in a single Matchup. It just sucks when you lose everything anyway :( This way you just pick yourself up after a loss and fight to win your coins back!Just keep on fighting! The more matchups & tournaments you join, the more fyrecoins you earn. The more you earn, the more rewards you get!

For the NA market this means that items in our shop will be converted based on the rate above (EU market will have it's own fyrecoin rate which should be similar to the above). For example, a gamer mouse that costs in stores $100 will be in our shop for 2000 (1:20). So once you collect 2000 you'll be able to buy the mouse from our shop and we'll send it to you :)
fyrecoins can be purchased at our store as well but there will also be ways to acquire them for free such as joining tournaments, events, using tokens, unlocking achievements, and more.
Both the EU and NA will have similar set rates once we launch fyrecamp. For this campaign we are using the USD:fyrecoin rate which is set for the NA market. EUR:fyrecoin rate hasn't been set yet, but don't worry, we're looking to keep all rates as close to market conditions as possible. For those in the EU, expect around €1 = 20. We will announce the rate prior to the launch of fyrecamp.
*JUST TO BE CLEAR*  Not to be confused with gambling. You can only fight for coins in your own matchup, you cannot bet on someone else's match. This isn't a gambling/betting platform. YOU fight for coins based on your own skills, strategy, and gameplay, and if you are good enough to beat your opponent, you will be rewarded. No unknown or risky variables.

Also this is NOT a Pay2Win platform. Someone with more fyrecoins does not have ANY advantages over someone with less coins. I personally dislike P2W. We will never have a P2W model as it doesn't work with our strategy at all nor does it benefit us in anyway. So you can relax now :D
Of course, we will be working on anti-cheat/hack systems and putting a lot of our effort and financial resources into creating a secure platform to ensure minimal malicious behaviour. No one likes cheats or smurfs right? :)
 

fyrecamp Explained - More in-depth video about how it works.
The whole idea is to make fyrecoins widely accessible with minimal burden, both physically & financially, so that anyone can play without feeling like their bank accounts are being cleaned out or they have to work super hard to earn them. This also creates a more relaxed approach to competing for fyrecoins. In the end, you want to be getting rewards, not losing them.

fyrecamp began over a year ago, but back then it was still a rough & unorganised idea. Over time, it began to develop into something more serious, something possible, something that we've began to invest our time & money into making a reality.
We began by building our fyrestore. At first we wanted to build a store that would sell Gamer Gear and other gamer related items and afterwards we'd implement the ability to buy stuff using fyrecoins. During this time we decided to look for investors and had the team develop a working concept to present and hope to gain financial support, however, it was difficult. Most investors I contacted had no idea about eSports, and since it is a relatively new market, albeit a rapidly growing one, they weren't sure about its future, and some even considered it a temporary trend. Most investors told us to find incubation programs to see whether this idea would even be accepted publically and then come back to them for financial support. They liked the idea, it made sense to them, but they just weren't sure enough about the eSports gaming market.
So, after a lot of discussion we decided that we should turn to Crowdfunding. 

Especially because it allows us to directly communicate with you. Your support will tell us whether or not we are onto something here, and you can help us prove these investors wrong, that this isn't a trend, that there is potential.
As of now we have invested our time & money into creating our fyrestore which should be available soon.

However, in order for fyrecamp to become a fully functioning platform we need to expand our team and obtain resources necessary to make it operational.
We need:
TEAM

Additional Programers & Developers
	
Back-end & Front-end Developers
Technical Developers
Graphic, UI/UX Designers
Quality Assurance Testers


Software & Services
	
Licenses for various software
Anti-Cheat tools/Security


fyrestore Sales Team
	
Shop management


Lawyers & Accountants

MATERIAL

Office Space
Office Supplies & Furnishing
Workstations
a HUGE Coffee Machine to pull all-nighters :P
Warehousing

Currently we're all working from home but if we expand fyrecamp's team we need to consider renting an office, this comes with additional costs. We also will have to pay for the dreaded taxes *shivers* and hire lawyers to ensure that everything is done by the book. We are not putting all the costs on you, we ourselves are covering whatever costs we can to get as much as possible done :)
I am a stickler for quality services, products, and talent. I apply this same aproach to our team. We don't want to build a half-assed product that will come with tons of holes and problems, we want to hire a talented team of quality specialists that will build a powerful quality platform. Luckily I have access to very talented people due to my original career but they come at a price. I would rather pay more, and have less problems, then vice-versa, for obvious reasons :)

This is why we need your support. Since we're directing our product at Gamers that play eSport games, we want you to be directly involved. Our goal...
 
$450,000 USD | 9,000,000
 
Reaching this goal would allow us to build a fyrecamp that will be worthy of your time. The beta version of Standard fyrecamp (Tier 1) will be available to you within 2-3 months after the end of this campaign, with the full version of Standard fyrecamp ready 1-2mths after that. Features and improvements will be added continuously as they are ready. Expect most features to be implemented within the first half a year after the end of this campaign. EU will be the first to get fyrecamp with North America shortly after. We chose flexible funding as development is split into 3 tiers. Each tier reached will deliver the product ready to use with the tier's features implemented. We really want to reach all 3 Tiers since it will turn fyrecamp into something you'll definitely like. Not just a standard eSport platform like most others out there, this is something more for you. Get ready to earn for your game-time! :DWe are IT Professionals that worked on much bigger projects (part of our careers from Design/Development/Interactive Agencies :D ) so we can ensure you we know what we're doing and we are ready to deliver.
Standard fyrecamp (Tier 1)
$140,000 | 2,800,000
Just reaching this will ensure you can use the fyrecoins & tokens from the perks. This will allow us to implement core features such as the fyrecoin system, reward exchange, matchups & tournaments (create, manage, and search), and basic business tools. Beta Testers will be invited during this stage to give feedback on the development of fyrecamp.
Advanced fyrecamp (Tier 2)
$320,000 | 6,400,000
Tier 2 will see the development of more powerful tools & features such as multi-stage and bracket tournament management, promotion, and caster tools, advanced profile & team management, tokens, friends lists, and messaging system. Businesses will get more powerful tools to give them more control and customisation of their tournaments including prize management capabilities.
Kick-ass fyrecamp (Tier 3)
$450,000 | 9,000,000
The final tier, or rather, the end of the first chapter will allow us to develop the fyrecoin API Payment system that will allow businesses to implement fyrecoins as a method of payment directly in their shops. Most importantly, we'll begin developing anti-cheat systems and security.
Tier 4 FIRST STRETCH GOAL
$600,000 | 12,000,000
We'll only unveil the first stretch goal for now to show you the future of fyrecamp. If we manage to reach this (and I sincerely hope we do) we'll be able to include Achievements. By unlocking achievements such as winning 10 1v1 matches in a row vs a Gold Rank you receive 20 or achieve Gold Rank in a game and get 40. Also you can get tokens through achievements. This stretch goal will also allow us to develop a more robust token system for added bonuses/boosts. Twitch & Feeds integration including notification panels.
There are plans to begin work on a mobile version of fyrecamp that will give you access to the latest news, events, exclusive deals, calendar, friends list, challenge notifications, matchups, and tournaments.
FYI - every amount that goes past our goal will also go towards speeding up and improving development as it will allow us to build a larger team.

TOKENS
So what are tokens? Consider them as boosters for every matchup you battle in. When planning/setting up a Matchup, you can choose a token to ""boost"" various elements of the matchup (no no no :D don't worry, it doesn't give you an advantage over your opponent, it's not a P2W kind of thing, hear me out). By boosting various elements, I mean mostly the rewards you get from the matchup. For this campaign we've decided to release 5 different tokens for you to use during your matchups. Setup the match, choose a fyrecoin, and then, if you want, you can apply a token boost.
Let me explain what each of the 5 does (we'll be adding more tokens in the future):

"" Freebie "" Token

	
This token entitles you to a free matchup where the coin chosen for the Matchup = 2, 5, or 10. Whoever wins gets fyrecoins equal to the coins value for the given match. Consider this as a free coin from us to you so you can battle it out.


"" Ghost Coin "" Token
	
The Ghost Coin adds to the matchup a 3rd coin to the pot equal to the value of the match's set coin. For example, you setup a match for 20. Both you and your opponent put 20 each, making it 40 in the pot, this token adds a 3rd 20 to the matchup's pot. Whoever wins the match will walk out with 60. This token doesn't influence your wallet if you lose, it is only a bonus if you win.


"" Double UP "" Token
	
This DOUBLES the winnings of a given matchup. Let's say you and your opponent choose the 20 for your fight, there is now 40 to win, with this token boost it will DOUBLE that, making it 80 possible to win. This token doesn't influence your wallet if you lose, it is only a bonus if you win.


"" Grab 50 "" Token
	
Grab 50 token allows you to setup a match for free where the winnings = 50. You don't have to pay from your own coins to fight. Whoever wins, grabs 50. It's just a free 50 giveaway through a fight :D


"" Grab 100 "" Token
	
Just like the Grab 50, this time, the matchup is for 100! :O FREE! Whoever wins gets 100.


"" Epic Gear "" Campaign Only Token
This token entitles you to trade in your token for any gear from our shop up to $100 USD worth. Shipping not included.


"" Ultimate Gear "" Campaign Only Token
This token gets you ANY gear from our shop. Regardless of price. Shipping not included.



TEAM EDITIONS
Team editions are for 5 people, the perk bonuses are split amongst you and 4 others. You will be able to invite up to 4 friends. When you buy this perk, we'll contact you about which 4 friends you'd like to have join fyrecamp :)
BUSINESS EDITIONS
*MUST BE a gaming-related business :) As long as you are somehow involved in the gaming market then you can take advantage of our Business Perks.As you are aware, businesses will play an influencial role in fyrecamp, you will be offering gamers ways to battle for amazing prizes that you have, prizes like fyrecoins, tokens, gamer gear, or products/services you have :) You will create & manage your own tournaments for gamers on fyrecamp.
We are also developing an API Payment Method that allows you to use fyrecoins as a method of payment for your services/products. Gamers will be able to go to your shop/service and buy whatever they can with fyrecoins they earn on fyrecamp :) We will have special rates available for businesses who purchase the "" Business is Business "" PERK.
These packages also include a tournament starter pack and your company Logo will be displayed on our page as a partner :)
Contact us at backers@fyrecamp.com for more information about what we have to offer companies and how the rates will work.

One of our main concerns right now is operating in various countries throughout the EU & NA. Each country has it's own laws & regulations and we'll need to adhere to them and at the same time ensure that our users will be able to smoothly access & use fyrecamp without hindrance. We'll be hiring the appropriate legal & financial teams necessary in order to allow smooth operation and to have everything done by the book. We've never had a multinational business before so it'll be a first for us ^^;
Cheaters & Hackers, unfortunately, in the world of eSport Gaming (and not only eSports) they are present. Many companies and businesses have been fighting against them and joining together to create alliances that would battle these malicious people. We want to join this fight and prevent them from causing you trouble. We'll be working closely with security teams & businesses to offer a secure platform. It isn't cheap to build a secure platform, and we don't know exactly how much it will be. It depends on how big your platform is and how many users use it. 


fyrecamp is based in the EU, in Warsaw, Poland.

<p>Exordium is a ""Pen and Paper Role-play"" game
(PnPRPG) dedicated to boost gameplay experience through both explicit narration
and an abundance of illustrations, allowing the players to be fully submerged
into the world while they reenact the roles of sentient species of their
choosing. Furthermore the book provides numerous game systems to enhance the
role-playing experience: professions, character development, pseudo real-time
battles, quick quest creator and so on.</p>

<p>A “Pen and Paper RPG” is a form of
tabletop role-playing game in which the participants describe their characters'
actions through speech. The players determine the actions of their characters
based on their in-game personality and those actions succeed or fail according
to a formal system of rules and guidelines. Within the rules, players have the
freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the
game. Actions taken by the players are considered by the almighty Game Master and
he or she determines an appropriate outcome.</p>

<p>Since we strive for impeccable details on both our
Core Manual and Miniatures, we have decided to keep the manufacturing local,
which will help our small town’s economy as well. Outsourcing the game may lead to critical and
irreversible mistakes. These mistakes can result in a lower quality product and
we really cannot have that. Our manual will be printed by a
local publisher and our plastics, injection molded by a local manufacturer.</p>
<p>For the miniatures we aim for high definition
details, for that reason we chose 3D printing. But not any 3D printer can do HD
quality. To fine print the miniatures as you see them below, we will be using
SLA and MultiJet printing. These printers can produce details as low as 20
microns (0.02 mm/0.0008 in) to achieve even the smallest of details.</p>
<p>Outside
our team, we will be closely working with Engineers, publishing, modeling and
3D printing professionals to ease the process and clarify any unknown factors
and errors along the way.</p>

concluded that battles in a pen and paper game can get a bit (very) tedious. Because
of this, a primary aim for us has always been a more trimmed and direct battle
system. We recommend using the miniature figures and inanimate objects made by
us to ease the process but they are not mandatory and can easily be substituted
by drawn maps and simple game pieces. The “Exordium Core Manual + Dice” perk is
all you need for that good-old, genuine “Pen and Paper” feeling.</p>
<p>For these reasons we have split the gameplay into 3
modes.</p>
<p><b>Role-playing in Scenario Mode</b></p>
<p>The scenario mode is the pure pen and paper
experience. The game lets you dive into a world of endless wonders as one of six
master species while having the freedom to decide your own fate. Exploring,
evolving, gathering experience and equipment from tasks, quests and epic
campaigns.</p>
<p><b>“Scenario” to “Combat”: Transition Mode</b></p>
<p>A system dedicated to converting scenario actions to
combat actions and vice-versa, this is a simplified combat mode designed
for all you true pen and paper lovers out there. This version of gameplay still
uses the “pseudo real-time” battle system but is simplified and it does not
require miniatures and a battlefield, just your character sheet and dice.</p>
<p><b>Battling in Combat mode</b></p>
<p>The lightweight battle system is designed for
ease-of-use and puts rules and enforcement on action cards, freeing the
Game Master from a lot of bookkeeping. However the GM still has control over
the battle, as usual his or her word is law.</p>
<p>As hinted by the miniatures and terrain objects,
the system is heavily reliant on true physical dimensions. All objects have
number statistics - such as strength, endurance, weight etc. - and abilities - reflection,
ricochet etc. - required for interactions.</p>
<p>Besides the interaction factor, our system
depicts another rather simple yet very functional aspect. Strategies and
actions are all dependent on split second, simultaneous turns, previously mentioned
as the PR (pseudo real-time) system. How does that work, you wonder?</p><p></p><p></p>
<p><b></b></p><p>        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436213401/w9kfbfg373vmnpfiypbc.png"" src="""" style=""width: 537.880794701987px; height: 262px;""/></p><p><b></b></p><b></b><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p><p><b>Here is how:</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1: At the beginning of each round
every participant in the battle chooses their initial action.</b></p>
<p>Actions are represented by “action cards” , also
included in the Core Manual as blank templates since actions change statistics
and abilities as your character levels. Each action card has an initiative stat
which represents a time span (0=Instant, 1-10=Normal, 11=Delayed).</p>
<p><b>Step 2: The action cards are then
placed by initiative in ascending order (the lowest being the fastest to
happen).</b></p>
<p><b>Step 3: The actions are then resolved in
the order of initiative. A player can change their mind and choose another
action depending on a few base rules:</b></p>
<p>If switching with another action card, the
player must NOT have resolved his initial action yet.</p>
<p>If choosing a “reaction” action card, the rules on
the card must be explicitly followed.</p>
<p>Other card types, such as control cards, split-second
cards, and dodge cards are also available to use as long as their rules apply.</p>
<p><b>Step 4: Check for “delayed” actions.</b></p>
<p>Any action that requires over 10 initiative is
considered delayed. The rules state that actions of up to 10 initiative can be
resolved in a single round. Delayed actions take longer than that and must
continue executing in the next one. For this reason the action is then placed
again but this time its initiative is decreased by 10.</p>
<p>After resolving the delayed action the player can
choose one more action to take that round. That action cannot be another
delayed action and takes the +initiative as it is being slowed by the first
action. (Tokens will be made to ease this process.)</p>
<p><b><i>Example:</i></b></p>
<p><i>A Madruk is reloading a Mortar but this
is a delayed action with a “16” initiative value. The first 10 initiative from
that action takes up the whole first round and the leftover 6 is carried to the
next one. </i></p>
<p><i>As he completes his action, he decides to
fire it, which is another 4 initiative (6+4). The fire action is placed on the
10 marker and then executed.</i></p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! The mortar is a formidable
weapon, but a rather slow one. The “Fire Mortar” action card also has a secondary
initiative stat, this time for reaching the target.</p>
<p> <b><i>Example:</i></b></p>
<p><i>The Mortar is fired in the air and it
takes 2 more initiative to land. This places the blazing armament on the 2
initiative marker in the 3rd round. It is then resolved with the rest of
the actions from that round.</i></p>
<p><b>Why is the system so deep in the timing
aspect?</b></p>
<p>Timing is everything in battles. Species like the
Wazur are incredibly fast and agile which makes them not only the quickest
to act in battle, but are also able to execute two or even three actions in a single
round.</p>
<p>Within the rules, the system actually allows for
a lot of freedom. Actions interact with one another and can be executed in a
combo or fused together to form a new one (an aspect we will talk about during
play tests on our upcoming channel broadcasts at <a href=""http://www.twitch.tv/MeKhanIXtv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Twitch.tv/MeKhanIXtv</a> ).</p>
<p><b> <u>No-Miss Factor</u></b></p>
<p>For efficient, quick battling, there is no missing
due to a bad die roll, but it is still possible to miss. The “no-miss”
rule applies only if the target is somehow immobilized or unwilling to move or
dodge the attack.</p>
<p><b>How does this help the battle?</b></p>
<p>First, unnecessary die rolls are forfeit unless
the action specifically calls for it. Secondly, many battles systems give you
the opportunity to defend while your character is also in offence. Our systems
rely on the logic that during execution of one (initial) action, say, a kick,
you cannot also use dodge action unless the first action never happened OR the
initial action has a built-in dodge ability.</p>
<p>In the gameplay, the actions string together and
resolve in amazingly complex ways with endless tactical options. </p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">                                           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436213305/itslx9roechmtlnapbub.png"" src="""" style=""width: 197.012422360248px; height: 109px;""/></b><br/></p><p><b><u></u></b></p><b></b><p><b><u>Classes</u></b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>Classes in Exordium are split into 2 categories:
Professions and Elite</p>
<p>Professions unlike Elite are a humble beginning for
every character, Pilot, Engineer, Hunter, but even they can get a little
strange - Bio Technician, Elementalist, Warrior, Druid, Monk, etc. </p>
<p>Some elites however are more than just bizarre. The
sentient creatures of this world go to great lengths for wisdom and power. By gathering
excessive knowledge they have combined expertise and perpetually evolved
into adepts of their own making.</p>
<p>The Elite classes are also species specific, which

religious and spiritual beliefs, Tan-Nak scientists theorize that even though
the species are very diverse to the point where their base elements do not
match, they share a common ancestor. Proof for this are similar physical
conditions and disorders observed in each of the master species.”</p>
<p><b><u>Tan-Nak</u></b></p>
<p>Tangra’s first creations were the so
called Universal Beings named after him. Tangra’s name is a compilation of 3
words “Tan, Nak, Ra” – “Universal, Being, God”. It is heavily debated on which
word comes first, but the meaning “An almighty being of all that exists” is
commonly accepted throughout the three species worshipping Tangra – Tan Nak,
Brotta and Madruk.</p>
<p>The Tan-Nak are considered the first
and foremost specie. Their body shape is what the manuscripts describe as
inspiration for the lesser gods, a template for them to create from.</p>
<p>The Tan-Nak are mainly divided into
two subspecies:</p>
<p><b>Civilians</b></p>
<p>The Tan-Nak are pretty much the
default human race. Minor differences make them one of a kind.</p>
<p>They possess a thin white layer over
their eyeballs which act as a brightness enhancer. It also hides their iris
which is disconcerting for other species, who often accuse them of staring. Their
body hair can change colors through the duration of their lives. The colors can
be very bright and saturated.</p>
<p>High population rates, universal adaptability,
regeneration and longevity have kept them from being obliterated by the Brotta
for millennia.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A Tan-Nak can live for over half a millennium (militarized Tan-Nak live a third of that life span). On an average of a hundred years their bodies completely regenerate from an older exhausted version of themselves to a younger and more capable one. In this long process any defects are being mended and lost organs regrown; old teeth fall off and new ones erect.</p>
<p>Given enough time, a Tan-Nak can adapt to live in the throat a volcano, in the arctic tundra at sub-zero degree temperature without any clothing, and even underground without sunlight or sufficient breathable air. Furthermore, they are able to readapt again in a span of two decades.</p>
<p>Next-to-last in physical qualities, but first in population, the Tan-Nak can be found all over the world in all shapes and sizes. They are a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>The Military Tan-Nak are modified to the point of no
return. Their lifespan is limited in order to enhance their muscular system as
well as their brain functionality. In their short lives, they undergo a
chemical enhancement called “pumping” through which chemicals are introduced to
induce development of additional muscular fibers and condition the brain to
learn quickly by skipping short term memory, in theory. A brutal, intense
breeding process leaves them underdeveloped. The majority of militaries have
facial disfigurements, lack of eyelid and lips, missing nose cartilage. The
“pumping” process leaves irreparable scars mostly on their backs. Tattooed
indicators of chemicals around the scared areas are also common.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A mask, a coat and an exo-suit are the uniforms they
wear while serving the military, until the day they expire. The masks purify
air, supply additional chemicals if needed and detects harmful airborne
substances. </p>
<p>The suit designs began as a mechanical exoskeleton
but it was then deemed useless as it did not enforce further strength but
rather superseded it, slowed down the wearer and, very often, got in the way of
work. The new advanced carbon fiber exo-suit tightly enwraps the wearer and has
direct skin contact. It acts as a nerve system enhancer allowing the wearer to
use their full muscular potential. The coat top is made out of fire resistant
fibers and has the strength of a bulletproof vest. The layout of the coat
promotes freedom of movement and gives easy access to smaller equipment through
“hook and loop” fasteners and pockets.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b><u>Brotta</u></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Brotta are a silicon-based life form. They have
evolved and developed their culture in territories with high concentrations of
pure mineral formations.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Brotta are the supremeconquering force of this world. They
are natural psychopaths and rarely care about the “why”. They do not feel
remorse and have no interest in peaceful negotiations, unless they have a
hidden agenda.</p>
<p>The Brotta are divided in three main subspecies. The
shape of their brains and base skin color is what makes them different. A
crystal-formed skeletal system is the base of their bodies. Their place in the
hierarchy is determined by the several minerals from which their bones are made
of. Royalty and power are especially reserved for those with a diamond-like
skeleton.</p>

<p>They are the tallest known sentient life form. 
They range from 3 to 3.7 meters (9 to 12 feet).</p>
<p>Their faces lackan
oral cavity. Instead they have an air duct connected to a second pair of
nostrils on the back of their neck for speech.</p>
<p>Crystal formations, superseding the chin area up to
the nose, grow outwards and pierce through the skin. They form beard-like ornaments.
Each Brotta has a unique set which is their version of a fingerprint.</p>

<p>Their arms are unusually long and their hands have
not one but two opposable thumbs, which gives them a good tight grip, and an
incision in the center of the palm. This triple split opening is surrounded by
a soft tissue. The tissuesecretes
compounds which dissolve hard minerals into liquid so that the sponge-like
tissue can absorb it. The bulges on their arms, just under the shoulders, are
small stomachs that process and distribute food.</p>
<p>Their legs are inverted and instead of feet they have
hooves, each split in three parts, two frontal and one on the back. They act as
three toes and help manage rough terrain.</p>
<p>The front of the torso isevenly covered by a
rib-like, dense bone structure. That is the birthing chamber. The back is
segmented and two rotation discs pivots allow lateral bending.</p>
<p>Since the Brotta liquidize their food, no excretory
system is present but instead, sweat out inept liquids through their hoofs and vaporize
gasses through their heads. It is not uncommon to see a Brotta with his scalp
burning blue with fumes<b>.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>A specially developed organ in their chest resembles
two rapidly beating hearts which are entangledwith one another. As the hearts beat
out of rhythm, a gyroscopic effect takes place. This mechanism helps the Brotta
to stand straight up and makes them hard to bring down, which makes their
overly tall stature deceptively stable<b><i>.</i></b></p>

<p></p>
<p>In terms of labor, the Brotta rarely use their own
hands. Their hundreds of thousands of slaves do the work for them. From keeping
up the land and growing crystal food, to manufacturing items of use for the Brotta.
The only aspect they keep for themselves is their infamous mineral growing
techniques. By molecularly engineering mineral growth patterns the Brotta are
able to literally erect a building in under a month. Most of their technology,
also kept in secret, is again grow in specific shapes resembling circuit
boards. </p>
<p>Their weapons and vehicles use energy syphoned by the
mineral deposits underneath their lands. Alas these technologies are useless
outside their old boarders.</p>
<h3><b><u>Madruk</u></b></h3>

thick skull, an overly muscular body, and a bad temper, they have shock
absorbing cartilage pads embedded under their skin. Even the females have them
to protect their more susceptible to pain body parts. Furthermore, their skin’s
derma is thick and rubbery, almost bulletproof. The epidermis is rough and
callous. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436201408/ipeynatrim7vnf5nko5m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436201418/lcc0hkr6zh6ugqy0k7vn.png"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 324px;""/></p><p>

the mouth. These teeth are razor sharp and are used to cut the tips of their
cigars. Their hands have three pairs of fingers, each pair mimics one larger
finger. Most Madruk never use these additional divisions. Enlarged feet plates

<p>The common Madruk are hot-headed,
violent, and usually very drunk. They are easily provoked and in
rare occasions so much so that their inner temperature rises to a
point where their derma starts to glow. While infuriated the Madruk are
extremely dangerous but also very fragile as their derma becomes soft
and easily damaged. This process is also called “Tempering” and is necessary to
harden the cartilage
pads of their younger offspring. </p><br/><p><span></span></p><p>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436207659/gbqe7knq24vhlel1weuy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 469px; height: 577px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Madruk faction in power is composed of paranoid
anarchists and their ruling can only be compared to the late stages of
communism and slavery. They drive colossal vehicles, which run on hard fuel, hauling
tens of wagons which contain whole town establishments. This long caravan sets
camp when needed, and the wagons form up a circular defensive perimeter around
the settlement.</p>
<p>The fuel that drives their light escort motor
vehicles, “Kiriya”, is produced from a special fruit mixed with the mineralization
and purification of a moisture loving, pipe dwelling fungus. This liquid is
also congestible and very intoxicating. The word “Kiriya” is from an old Madruk
dialect and can mean not only “booze” but also – victory, a good trading deal,
attack and loot. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436207805/xfhokkdwilpntkstco07.png"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>

peculiar tribal race of bio-mechanoids. They were the first to create gunpowder
and fireworks, but are not credited for it.</p>
<p>Their biological
half has fused with a metallic mechanical harness to form an incredibly
beneficial symbiosis. Stories told by the elders unveil how this happened to
them.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436201475/i1qiwototjzyjqgdxlsd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436201483/cu3zgtha6b0ttsu3lyoh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 616.416184971098px; height: 172px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>It’s told that
in the past the Biomaton were purely biological, a “Protomaton”. Their
infant bodies grew outwards from a leathery egg and formed the limbs. The story
goes that a protomaton female was running from an enemy tribe where her
offspring was kidnapped to be sacrificed by a shaman. She hid him in an old
scrap pile, which had fallen from the sky islands where the Cyionic reside. When
she came back to feed the infant, it had already started fusing with the
metallic components surrounding it, thus the first Biomaton was born. Since
then the Biomaton have established strict regulation to what components a
metallic harness can be comprised of, to enforce that no weaponry will be
directly fused and concealed by the body.</p>
<p>Instead of hair
they have segmented pipes which transfer nutrition to the brain and acidic
fluid from it. </p>
<p>The metallically
encased spine is and organ of an upmost curiosity and the central balancing part
of their body. Its stable construction and flexibility allow the torso and arms
to rest freely on top of it. Their ribcage is at float and requires no
additional surrounding muscles.</p>
<p>The spine in
males curves backward from the chest to form a hunch and it is attached on the rare
of the pelvis. In females, it is quite the opposite: the spine arches forward
through the chest and it isattached in the foremost part of
the pelvis, forming a belly-like oval between the pair of egg-bearing breasts.</p>
<p>The males are
formed with one almost completely mechanical arm and their body develops a
biological counterpart which grows in size to balance out the weight for each
side of the chest. The legs are double-jointed and excellent for jumping and
running. Both male and female bodies are fully covered, even the metallic
parts, by a transparentprotective skin layer.</p>
<p>From biological
speaker-like organs to a mechanical hearing apparatus are what these Biomatons
are made of. An incredible one-of-a-kind symbiosis, but not without its
downsides. Their bodies produce two types of blood, one for the biological
parts and one for the mechanical. This creates an abnormal acidity levels,
mostly in the males which, if not cleansed properly, can cause acid-loving life
forms to swarm all over their bodies. The acid is generated in the skull,
transferred down the segmented hair, through the spineand finally extruded
from two waste canals just above their heals  <i>(too brotta or not</i>?). The acidic liquid
also neutralizes any foot prints or scents left by the Biomaton.</p>
<p>The male's pipes
detached and reattached on the females to impregnate them. This process is very
dangerous since females, produce much less acidity and process it slower than
males. If successful, women lay leathery eggs that, until that moment, are
stored in their breasts. The eggs are then placed in a mechanical harness to
develop.</p>                                              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436208624/b1scjyfjvkeuxnm8mcmk.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 239.713405238829px; height: 402px; background-color: initial;""/><div>
<p>Spiritual beliefs give great importance to eyes.
This is why Biomaton own coconut-sized glass eyes in their huts. Smaller, round
glass containers are used to hold tiny amounts of chemicals. These containers
become fragile when contacted by the Biomaton’s acidic bodily fluid, such as
spit and other secretions, and are then thrown in a group of two or more to
create specific effects: Smoke, fire, flash, stickiness amd others.<br/></p>
<h3><span><b><u>Wazur</u></b></span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Wazur are a
sentient plant life. They may seem humanoid, but they were not always like
that. The last known continent to be discovered, far below the planet’s equator,
was their little piece of heaven. They had thrived and flourished for
millennia, completely oblivious to the other species. The Brotta were the first
to find them and enslave a small part of the population only to find that they
withered and died without freedom. Then a group of military Tan-Nak, burdened
with the mission to find new strategic territories, arrived and discover the sylph
race of seedlings. In an act of fear and disparity, their bodies began
undergoing a reshaping process to imitate their visitors, supposedly to better
communicate with them.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Simply put, the
Wazur are your common plant life, but one that has developed a mind of its own.
Ninety percent of the population of the continent are plant life forms which
have developed legs and visual and vibrational senses.</p>
<p>Their bodies are
networks of soft elastic fiber, the skin is even more so. They are small, but
flexible and extremely quick. </p>
<p>The wazur’s face
resembles a carved wooden mask in many of its features. This mask and
surrounding skin covers a skull-like hard shell. The shell encompasses a soft
brain tissue from which their whole fiber skeletal structure begins. A
root-like complex also dilates from the shell to form their fictive hair. </p>
<p>Wazur breathe
carbon dioxide by means of an angular, pyramid-like nose which contrasts with
the rest of the facial features. Their mouth is used mainly for speaking,
because they get their energy via photosynthesis. However, their tongue acts as
a very powerful chemical recognition device. Any substance can be felt and
described by the Wazur.</p>
<p>On their
foreheads, they have a mirror-like oval formation. This is a protrusion of
their skull that penetrates through the maskand is directly
connected to the soft brain tissue. The “mirror” acts as a communication device
between Wazur. Much like an infrared signal, this device sends information and
their skulls act like a receiver. A two-way communication is made when both
Wazur are facing each other. This makes up for unbeatable team work while in a
skirmish.A team of wazur warriors in action is something to behold –
swift, deadly, and acting as one. </p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Another
form of communication is the genetic exchange which activates the birthing
process. This exchange is described by the Wazur as a very satisfying
out-of-body experience. After the female has received the genes she produces a
large seed which is then placed in the ground for a beautiful birthing tree to cultivate.
The tree then sprouts many fruit which contain small Wazur seedlings<i>. </i>After the fruit matures it drops off
the tree branch to fall on large cushion-like leaves underneath and slide to
solid ground, where it is collected by breeders. The Wazur do not see children
as someone else’s progeny. They collect and take care of seedlings as a group,
the tree produces more than a handful of offspring.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436201861/ulvkfrgknlabmted10xa.png"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 618.977272727273px; height: 520px; background-color: initial;""/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The wazur body
can regenerate, much like a lizard’s tail. This lets them regrow a whole limb
in a matter of days. In fact, a wazur can survive even a decapitation, provided
the head is then permanently rooted to the ground to be kept alive.</p>
<p>They have long
legs, but that is only because they are digitigrade. The foot and heel arelocked
in a vertical position and take up a third of the leg. This mode of walking on
their toes makes them nimble and silent in their legs. When needed, however,
the ankle joints can be released to move into a plantigrade position, which
allows them to perform leaps and accelerate rapidly.</p>
<p>The “Neyd” wazur
are a subspecies genetically modified by the Tan Nak by splicing the birthing
tree with a Neyd tree. These Wazur can be short fused. Their physical
appearance is more of an old tree, because of their quickly hardening skin which
then peels off.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436208465/sbu8qktsr12utxhnqqyo.png"" src="""" style=""width: 618.734693877551px; height: 489px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since
the Wazur are surrounded by quadruped plants, they use them as cattle and even
graft useful objects directly onto them. Wazur can be seen riding a
rhinoceros-like creature with a plant-grown throne grafted directly to it. This
way if the add-on is damaged it will self-repair by tapping into the host
creature’s life force.</p>

<h3><u>Cyionic</u></h3>

<p>In this
world where bizarre is normal, the Cyionic are the odd species.</p>

<p>These beings are literally created by two Queen
mothers which use them as every day laborers. Their bodies are arsenic-based which
predisposes them to an alloy shell. Alloys, wires and mercury plasma mimic a
biological body. Most of them are created without a personality. They start off
featureless with a singular sensation encompassed by their hyper sensitive hair
fibers. The top skin layer is a cushiony, elastic alloy covered by hair fibers
shaped like hooks. These metallic hairs are used to connect the Cyionic to a
number of technological devices that are placed directly onto the skin and held
there by the combined strength of the hairs. These devices enable them to
function as any other creature by giving them visual and vibrational input but
these upgrades go far beyond basic senses<br/></p>

<p>Their heads
have a wheel-shaped organ placed halfway through the skull. This is their
brain, and it spins as they process thoughts and commands.</p>
<p>Another
fascinating aspect of their lives is that they consume metals for nutrition.
The metals are dissolved and distributed around the body to feed their alloy
base. If a single metal is consumed in larger quantities the outer skin of the
Cyionic becomes saturated with that metal. The metal’s properties apply to the
Cyionic which has its upsides and downsides.</p>
<p>They live
on top of narrow mountains called “Sky islands” by the Biomaton. Cyionic and
Biomaton share a continent but are divided by height. Cyionic have no need for
interaction with anyone else but themselves. The Biomaton praise the
technologically advanced species as demi-gods.</p>

Exordium is a ""Pen and Paper Role-play"" game
(PnPRPG) dedicated to boost gameplay experience through both explicit narration
and an abundance of illustrations, allowing the players to be fully submerged
into the world while they reenact the roles of sentient species of their
choosing. Furthermore the book provides numerous game systems to enhance the
role-playing experience: professions, character development, pseudo real-time
battles, quick quest creator and so on.



A “Pen and Paper RPG” is a form of
tabletop role-playing game in which the participants describe their characters'
actions through speech. The players determine the actions of their characters
based on their in-game personality and those actions succeed or fail according
to a formal system of rules and guidelines. Within the rules, players have the
freedom to improvise; their choices shape the direction and outcome of the
game. Actions taken by the players are considered by the almighty Game Master and
he or she determines an appropriate outcome.




MeKhanIX is an
independent start-up company based in Silistra, Bulgaria. Our main goal is to
design and develop alternative gameplay variants to Pen and Paper RPG as well
as board games.
The MeKhanIX team currently consists
of three people:
Volen ""Will"" Valentinov - Head of MeKhanIX, Lead game designer and
writer of Exordium.
Nikolay ""Nihon"" Kalchev - Lead concept artist, digital sculptor and
co-designer of Exordium.
Preslav ""Valserp"" Yordanov - Lead hard surface designer, specializing in lightening and
rendering.




Since we strive for impeccable details on both our
Core Manual and Miniatures, we have decided to keep the manufacturing local,
which will help our small town’s economy as well. Outsourcing the game may lead to critical and
irreversible mistakes. These mistakes can result in a lower quality product and
we really cannot have that. Our manual will be printed by a
local publisher and our plastics, injection molded by a local manufacturer.
For the miniatures we aim for high definition
details, for that reason we chose 3D printing. But not any 3D printer can do HD
quality. To fine print the miniatures as you see them below, we will be using
SLA and MultiJet printing. These printers can produce details as low as 20
microns (0.02 mm/0.0008 in) to achieve even the smallest of details.
Outside
our team, we will be closely working with Engineers, publishing, modeling and
3D printing professionals to ease the process and clarify any unknown factors
and errors along the way.


Meticulously
detailed chronicles of the world for total immersion.  Descriptions ranging from terrestrial biomes,
landforms, territorial dominions, flora and fauna - down
to behavior of species, culture and traditions, technologies and science.
Simple,
quick quest generation. The
Game Master section is equipped with lots of diverse quest templates
to mix-and-match together engaging adventures in minutes. Also
includes tips on how to create exciting and alluring campaigns.
Strategic
battles. “Pseudo real-time” battles are
achieved through an initial action phase to establish tactics for the turn
and a simultaneous resolution of all actions in their speed order.
Tactical
Miniature system with Miniature set included in the Collector’s edition. Specially designed to mimic real physical interaction
between objects and give the players additional actions during combat.
Snap-on
modular buildings included in the Collector’s edition. Modular inner and outer walls, and corners equipped with
small magnets to conjoin together forming multilevel structures. “Cover”
objects such as bricks, pipes and barriers are also included.

                                        After many years of game testing various RPGs we have
concluded that battles in a pen and paper game can get a bit (very) tedious. Because
of this, a primary aim for us has always been a more trimmed and direct battle
system. We recommend using the miniature figures and inanimate objects made by
us to ease the process but they are not mandatory and can easily be substituted
by drawn maps and simple game pieces. The “Exordium Core Manual + Dice” perk is
all you need for that good-old, genuine “Pen and Paper” feeling.
For these reasons we have split the gameplay into 3
modes.
Role-playing in Scenario Mode
The scenario mode is the pure pen and paper
experience. The game lets you dive into a world of endless wonders as one of six
master species while having the freedom to decide your own fate. Exploring,
evolving, gathering experience and equipment from tasks, quests and epic
campaigns.
“Scenario” to “Combat”: Transition Mode
A system dedicated to converting scenario actions to
combat actions and vice-versa, this is a simplified combat mode designed
for all you true pen and paper lovers out there. This version of gameplay still
uses the “pseudo real-time” battle system but is simplified and it does not
require miniatures and a battlefield, just your character sheet and dice.
Battling in Combat mode
The lightweight battle system is designed for
ease-of-use and puts rules and enforcement on action cards, freeing the
Game Master from a lot of bookkeeping. However the GM still has control over
the battle, as usual his or her word is law.
As hinted by the miniatures and terrain objects,
the system is heavily reliant on true physical dimensions. All objects have
number statistics - such as strength, endurance, weight etc. - and abilities - reflection,
ricochet etc. - required for interactions.
Besides the interaction factor, our system
depicts another rather simple yet very functional aspect. Strategies and
actions are all dependent on split second, simultaneous turns, previously mentioned
as the PR (pseudo real-time) system. How does that work, you wonder?
        Here is how:
Step 1: At the beginning of each round
every participant in the battle chooses their initial action.
Actions are represented by “action cards” , also
included in the Core Manual as blank templates since actions change statistics
and abilities as your character levels. Each action card has an initiative stat
which represents a time span (0=Instant, 1-10=Normal, 11=Delayed).
Step 2: The action cards are then
placed by initiative in ascending order (the lowest being the fastest to
happen).
Step 3: The actions are then resolved in
the order of initiative. A player can change their mind and choose another
action depending on a few base rules:
If switching with another action card, the
player must NOT have resolved his initial action yet.
If choosing a “reaction” action card, the rules on
the card must be explicitly followed.
Other card types, such as control cards, split-second
cards, and dodge cards are also available to use as long as their rules apply.
Step 4: Check for “delayed” actions.
Any action that requires over 10 initiative is
considered delayed. The rules state that actions of up to 10 initiative can be
resolved in a single round. Delayed actions take longer than that and must
continue executing in the next one. For this reason the action is then placed
again but this time its initiative is decreased by 10.
After resolving the delayed action the player can
choose one more action to take that round. That action cannot be another
delayed action and takes the +initiative as it is being slowed by the first
action. (Tokens will be made to ease this process.)
Example:
A Madruk is reloading a Mortar but this
is a delayed action with a “16” initiative value. The first 10 initiative from
that action takes up the whole first round and the leftover 6 is carried to the
next one. 
As he completes his action, he decides to
fire it, which is another 4 initiative (6+4). The fire action is placed on the
10 marker and then executed.
But wait, there’s more! The mortar is a formidable
weapon, but a rather slow one. The “Fire Mortar” action card also has a secondary
initiative stat, this time for reaching the target.
 Example:
The Mortar is fired in the air and it
takes 2 more initiative to land. This places the blazing armament on the 2
initiative marker in the 3rd round. It is then resolved with the rest of
the actions from that round.
Why is the system so deep in the timing
aspect?
Timing is everything in battles. Species like the
Wazur are incredibly fast and agile which makes them not only the quickest
to act in battle, but are also able to execute two or even three actions in a single
round.
Within the rules, the system actually allows for
a lot of freedom. Actions interact with one another and can be executed in a
combo or fused together to form a new one (an aspect we will talk about during
play tests on our upcoming channel broadcasts at www.Twitch.tv/MeKhanIXtv ).
 No-Miss Factor
For efficient, quick battling, there is no missing
due to a bad die roll, but it is still possible to miss. The “no-miss”
rule applies only if the target is somehow immobilized or unwilling to move or
dodge the attack.
How does this help the battle?
First, unnecessary die rolls are forfeit unless
the action specifically calls for it. Secondly, many battles systems give you
the opportunity to defend while your character is also in offence. Our systems
rely on the logic that during execution of one (initial) action, say, a kick,
you cannot also use dodge action unless the first action never happened OR the
initial action has a built-in dodge ability.
In the gameplay, the actions string together and
resolve in amazingly complex ways with endless tactical options.                                            ClassesClasses in Exordium are split into 2 categories:
Professions and Elite
Professions unlike Elite are a humble beginning for
every character, Pilot, Engineer, Hunter, but even they can get a little
strange - Bio Technician, Elementalist, Warrior, Druid, Monk, etc. 
Some elites however are more than just bizarre. The
sentient creatures of this world go to great lengths for wisdom and power. By gathering
excessive knowledge they have combined expertise and perpetually evolved
into adepts of their own making.
The Elite classes are also species specific, which
means that no two master species of the same Elite class shares the same
appearance but only similarities.                                                        Locus                                                        Omega

Exordium is a fascinating new
sci-fi realm with a pinch of fantasy, carefully designed to turn a new page in
Pen and Paper RPGs.
The world is filled with amazing
alternative life forms, incredible new minerals, mesmerizing landscapes and
much more. Six master, sentient speciesrule
the planet, but their existence is entangled in a deep, never ending war caused
by lust for dominance, immeasurable cruelty and quite often a “behavior
barrier”. But this is not the complete story, as this world has signs of love,
compassion and kindness emerging from underneath the violence and hatred. Scientists of this world theorize that the planet was
created by three separate fireballs; they inflamed celestial gas
clouds which rapidly formed the hard planetary mass. This quick
solidification relative to the chemical structure of the fireballs created
uneven landmasses, some rich in crystallized minerals, others on
metallic cinder. They also say the fireballs then collided shortly after,
to form what is today the sun. Close observation of the sun backs this theory
by revealing three district territories, burning in different colors.
The outer layer of this planet consists
of sundry gasses in uneven quantities, creating a prism effect which leads
to a difference in sunlight color around the globe.“…Unlike
religious and spiritual beliefs, Tan-Nak scientists theorize that even though
the species are very diverse to the point where their base elements do not
match, they share a common ancestor. Proof for this are similar physical
conditions and disorders observed in each of the master species.”
Tan-Nak
Tangra’s first creations were the so
called Universal Beings named after him. Tangra’s name is a compilation of 3
words “Tan, Nak, Ra” – “Universal, Being, God”. It is heavily debated on which
word comes first, but the meaning “An almighty being of all that exists” is
commonly accepted throughout the three species worshipping Tangra – Tan Nak,
Brotta and Madruk.
The Tan-Nak are considered the first
and foremost specie. Their body shape is what the manuscripts describe as
inspiration for the lesser gods, a template for them to create from.
The Tan-Nak are mainly divided into
two subspecies:
Civilians
The Tan-Nak are pretty much the
default human race. Minor differences make them one of a kind.
They possess a thin white layer over
their eyeballs which act as a brightness enhancer. It also hides their iris
which is disconcerting for other species, who often accuse them of staring. Their
body hair can change colors through the duration of their lives. The colors can
be very bright and saturated.
High population rates, universal adaptability,
regeneration and longevity have kept them from being obliterated by the Brotta
for millennia.


A Tan-Nak can live for over half a millennium (militarized Tan-Nak live a third of that life span). On an average of a hundred years their bodies completely regenerate from an older exhausted version of themselves to a younger and more capable one. In this long process any defects are being mended and lost organs regrown; old teeth fall off and new ones erect.
Given enough time, a Tan-Nak can adapt to live in the throat a volcano, in the arctic tundra at sub-zero degree temperature without any clothing, and even underground without sunlight or sufficient breathable air. Furthermore, they are able to readapt again in a span of two decades.
Next-to-last in physical qualities, but first in population, the Tan-Nak can be found all over the world in all shapes and sizes. They are a force to be reckoned with.

Military




The Military Tan-Nak are modified to the point of no
return. Their lifespan is limited in order to enhance their muscular system as
well as their brain functionality. In their short lives, they undergo a
chemical enhancement called “pumping” through which chemicals are introduced to
induce development of additional muscular fibers and condition the brain to
learn quickly by skipping short term memory, in theory. A brutal, intense
breeding process leaves them underdeveloped. The majority of militaries have
facial disfigurements, lack of eyelid and lips, missing nose cartilage. The
“pumping” process leaves irreparable scars mostly on their backs. Tattooed
indicators of chemicals around the scared areas are also common.




A mask, a coat and an exo-suit are the uniforms they
wear while serving the military, until the day they expire. The masks purify
air, supply additional chemicals if needed and detects harmful airborne
substances. 
The suit designs began as a mechanical exoskeleton
but it was then deemed useless as it did not enforce further strength but
rather superseded it, slowed down the wearer and, very often, got in the way of
work. The new advanced carbon fiber exo-suit tightly enwraps the wearer and has
direct skin contact. It acts as a nerve system enhancer allowing the wearer to
use their full muscular potential. The coat top is made out of fire resistant
fibers and has the strength of a bulletproof vest. The layout of the coat
promotes freedom of movement and gives easy access to smaller equipment through
“hook and loop” fasteners and pockets.

Brotta

The Brotta are a silicon-based life form. They have
evolved and developed their culture in territories with high concentrations of
pure mineral formations.
 

                                             


The Brotta are the supremeconquering force of this world. They
are natural psychopaths and rarely care about the “why”. They do not feel
remorse and have no interest in peaceful negotiations, unless they have a
hidden agenda.
The Brotta are divided in three main subspecies. The
shape of their brains and base skin color is what makes them different. A
crystal-formed skeletal system is the base of their bodies. Their place in the
hierarchy is determined by the several minerals from which their bones are made
of. Royalty and power are especially reserved for those with a diamond-like
skeleton.





They are the tallest known sentient life form. 
They range from 3 to 3.7 meters (9 to 12 feet).
Their faces lackan
oral cavity. Instead they have an air duct connected to a second pair of
nostrils on the back of their neck for speech.
Crystal formations, superseding the chin area up to
the nose, grow outwards and pierce through the skin. They form beard-like ornaments.
Each Brotta has a unique set which is their version of a fingerprint.

                                           


Their arms are unusually long and their hands have
not one but two opposable thumbs, which gives them a good tight grip, and an
incision in the center of the palm. This triple split opening is surrounded by
a soft tissue. The tissuesecretes
compounds which dissolve hard minerals into liquid so that the sponge-like
tissue can absorb it. The bulges on their arms, just under the shoulders, are
small stomachs that process and distribute food.
Their legs are inverted and instead of feet they have
hooves, each split in three parts, two frontal and one on the back. They act as
three toes and help manage rough terrain.
The front of the torso isevenly covered by a
rib-like, dense bone structure. That is the birthing chamber. The back is
segmented and two rotation discs pivots allow lateral bending.
Since the Brotta liquidize their food, no excretory
system is present but instead, sweat out inept liquids through their hoofs and vaporize
gasses through their heads. It is not uncommon to see a Brotta with his scalp
burning blue with fumes.

A specially developed organ in their chest resembles
two rapidly beating hearts which are entangledwith one another. As the hearts beat
out of rhythm, a gyroscopic effect takes place. This mechanism helps the Brotta
to stand straight up and makes them hard to bring down, which makes their
overly tall stature deceptively stable.




In terms of labor, the Brotta rarely use their own
hands. Their hundreds of thousands of slaves do the work for them. From keeping
up the land and growing crystal food, to manufacturing items of use for the Brotta.
The only aspect they keep for themselves is their infamous mineral growing
techniques. By molecularly engineering mineral growth patterns the Brotta are
able to literally erect a building in under a month. Most of their technology,
also kept in secret, is again grow in specific shapes resembling circuit
boards. 
Their weapons and vehicles use energy syphoned by the
mineral deposits underneath their lands. Alas these technologies are useless
outside their old boarders.
Madruk
The Madruk are the embodiment of toughness. Besides a
thick skull, an overly muscular body, and a bad temper, they have shock
absorbing cartilage pads embedded under their skin. Even the females have them
to protect their more susceptible to pain body parts. Furthermore, their skin’s
derma is thick and rubbery, almost bulletproof. The epidermis is rough and
callous. 
The three breasted-body is the Madruk’s
distinguishable earmark. Women birth children in instances of three. Their
heads are bucket-shaped, and skull is unbreakable. Their teeth are wide enough to
be used as secret compartments, while two opposing pairs of them extend outside
the mouth. These teeth are razor sharp and are used to cut the tips of their
cigars. Their hands have three pairs of fingers, each pair mimics one larger
finger. Most Madruk never use these additional divisions. Enlarged feet plates
and hard toesprotect an unusual
organ which captures even the weakest of vibrations.                                             

The common Madruk are hot-headed,
violent, and usually very drunk. They are easily provoked and in
rare occasions so much so that their inner temperature rises to a
point where their derma starts to glow. While infuriated the Madruk are
extremely dangerous but also very fragile as their derma becomes soft
and easily damaged. This process is also called “Tempering” and is necessary to
harden the cartilage
pads of their younger offspring.                   The Madruk faction in power is composed of paranoid
anarchists and their ruling can only be compared to the late stages of
communism and slavery. They drive colossal vehicles, which run on hard fuel, hauling
tens of wagons which contain whole town establishments. This long caravan sets
camp when needed, and the wagons form up a circular defensive perimeter around
the settlement.
The fuel that drives their light escort motor
vehicles, “Kiriya”, is produced from a special fruit mixed with the mineralization
and purification of a moisture loving, pipe dwelling fungus. This liquid is
also congestible and very intoxicating. The word “Kiriya” is from an old Madruk
dialect and can mean not only “booze” but also – victory, a good trading deal,
attack and loot. 
Another faction of
Madruks, the “Highly Intellectual Society”, live in the cold territories far in
the north. They have established their mechanically-advanced cities and
factories away from the anarchists, but are being oppressed by them and forced
to produce much of their arsenal.                                        The
Madruk do celebrate a special day in the year when, they believe, Tangra gave
them life. For this reason a large lone tree is chosen to be engulfed in fire
and burns through the remainder of the night while the Madruks are gorging
around vast tables.BiomatonBiomatons are a
peculiar tribal race of bio-mechanoids. They were the first to create gunpowder
and fireworks, but are not credited for it.
Their biological
half has fused with a metallic mechanical harness to form an incredibly
beneficial symbiosis. Stories told by the elders unveil how this happened to
them. It’s told that
in the past the Biomaton were purely biological, a “Protomaton”. Their
infant bodies grew outwards from a leathery egg and formed the limbs. The story
goes that a protomaton female was running from an enemy tribe where her
offspring was kidnapped to be sacrificed by a shaman. She hid him in an old
scrap pile, which had fallen from the sky islands where the Cyionic reside. When
she came back to feed the infant, it had already started fusing with the
metallic components surrounding it, thus the first Biomaton was born. Since
then the Biomaton have established strict regulation to what components a
metallic harness can be comprised of, to enforce that no weaponry will be
directly fused and concealed by the body.
Instead of hair
they have segmented pipes which transfer nutrition to the brain and acidic
fluid from it. 
The metallically
encased spine is and organ of an upmost curiosity and the central balancing part
of their body. Its stable construction and flexibility allow the torso and arms
to rest freely on top of it. Their ribcage is at float and requires no
additional surrounding muscles.
The spine in
males curves backward from the chest to form a hunch and it is attached on the rare
of the pelvis. In females, it is quite the opposite: the spine arches forward
through the chest and it isattached in the foremost part of
the pelvis, forming a belly-like oval between the pair of egg-bearing breasts.
The males are
formed with one almost completely mechanical arm and their body develops a
biological counterpart which grows in size to balance out the weight for each
side of the chest. The legs are double-jointed and excellent for jumping and
running. Both male and female bodies are fully covered, even the metallic
parts, by a transparentprotective skin layer.
From biological
speaker-like organs to a mechanical hearing apparatus are what these Biomatons
are made of. An incredible one-of-a-kind symbiosis, but not without its
downsides. Their bodies produce two types of blood, one for the biological
parts and one for the mechanical. This creates an abnormal acidity levels,
mostly in the males which, if not cleansed properly, can cause acid-loving life
forms to swarm all over their bodies. The acid is generated in the skull,
transferred down the segmented hair, through the spineand finally extruded
from two waste canals just above their heals  (too brotta or not?). The acidic liquid
also neutralizes any foot prints or scents left by the Biomaton.
The male's pipes
detached and reattached on the females to impregnate them. This process is very
dangerous since females, produce much less acidity and process it slower than
males. If successful, women lay leathery eggs that, until that moment, are
stored in their breasts. The eggs are then placed in a mechanical harness to
develop.                                              
Spiritual beliefs give great importance to eyes.
This is why Biomaton own coconut-sized glass eyes in their huts. Smaller, round
glass containers are used to hold tiny amounts of chemicals. These containers
become fragile when contacted by the Biomaton’s acidic bodily fluid, such as
spit and other secretions, and are then thrown in a group of two or more to
create specific effects: Smoke, fire, flash, stickiness amd others.
Wazur

The Wazur are a
sentient plant life. They may seem humanoid, but they were not always like
that. The last known continent to be discovered, far below the planet’s equator,
was their little piece of heaven. They had thrived and flourished for
millennia, completely oblivious to the other species. The Brotta were the first
to find them and enslave a small part of the population only to find that they
withered and died without freedom. Then a group of military Tan-Nak, burdened
with the mission to find new strategic territories, arrived and discover the sylph
race of seedlings. In an act of fear and disparity, their bodies began
undergoing a reshaping process to imitate their visitors, supposedly to better
communicate with them.



Simply put, the
Wazur are your common plant life, but one that has developed a mind of its own.
Ninety percent of the population of the continent are plant life forms which
have developed legs and visual and vibrational senses.
Their bodies are
networks of soft elastic fiber, the skin is even more so. They are small, but
flexible and extremely quick. 
The wazur’s face
resembles a carved wooden mask in many of its features. This mask and
surrounding skin covers a skull-like hard shell. The shell encompasses a soft
brain tissue from which their whole fiber skeletal structure begins. A
root-like complex also dilates from the shell to form their fictive hair. 
Wazur breathe
carbon dioxide by means of an angular, pyramid-like nose which contrasts with
the rest of the facial features. Their mouth is used mainly for speaking,
because they get their energy via photosynthesis. However, their tongue acts as
a very powerful chemical recognition device. Any substance can be felt and
described by the Wazur.
On their
foreheads, they have a mirror-like oval formation. This is a protrusion of
their skull that penetrates through the maskand is directly
connected to the soft brain tissue. The “mirror” acts as a communication device
between Wazur. Much like an infrared signal, this device sends information and
their skulls act like a receiver. A two-way communication is made when both
Wazur are facing each other. This makes up for unbeatable team work while in a
skirmish.A team of wazur warriors in action is something to behold –
swift, deadly, and acting as one. 

                               


Another
form of communication is the genetic exchange which activates the birthing
process. This exchange is described by the Wazur as a very satisfying
out-of-body experience. After the female has received the genes she produces a
large seed which is then placed in the ground for a beautiful birthing tree to cultivate.
The tree then sprouts many fruit which contain small Wazur seedlings. After the fruit matures it drops off
the tree branch to fall on large cushion-like leaves underneath and slide to
solid ground, where it is collected by breeders. The Wazur do not see children
as someone else’s progeny. They collect and take care of seedlings as a group,
the tree produces more than a handful of offspring.


The wazur body
can regenerate, much like a lizard’s tail. This lets them regrow a whole limb
in a matter of days. In fact, a wazur can survive even a decapitation, provided
the head is then permanently rooted to the ground to be kept alive.
They have long
legs, but that is only because they are digitigrade. The foot and heel arelocked
in a vertical position and take up a third of the leg. This mode of walking on
their toes makes them nimble and silent in their legs. When needed, however,
the ankle joints can be released to move into a plantigrade position, which
allows them to perform leaps and accelerate rapidly.
The “Neyd” wazur
are a subspecies genetically modified by the Tan Nak by splicing the birthing
tree with a Neyd tree. These Wazur can be short fused. Their physical
appearance is more of an old tree, because of their quickly hardening skin which
then peels off.


Since
the Wazur are surrounded by quadruped plants, they use them as cattle and even
graft useful objects directly onto them. Wazur can be seen riding a
rhinoceros-like creature with a plant-grown throne grafted directly to it. This
way if the add-on is damaged it will self-repair by tapping into the host
creature’s life force.


Cyionic

In this
world where bizarre is normal, the Cyionic are the odd species.


These beings are literally created by two Queen
mothers which use them as every day laborers. Their bodies are arsenic-based which
predisposes them to an alloy shell. Alloys, wires and mercury plasma mimic a
biological body. Most of them are created without a personality. They start off
featureless with a singular sensation encompassed by their hyper sensitive hair
fibers. The top skin layer is a cushiony, elastic alloy covered by hair fibers
shaped like hooks. These metallic hairs are used to connect the Cyionic to a
number of technological devices that are placed directly onto the skin and held
there by the combined strength of the hairs. These devices enable them to
function as any other creature by giving them visual and vibrational input but
these upgrades go far beyond basic senses




Their heads
have a wheel-shaped organ placed halfway through the skull. This is their
brain, and it spins as they process thoughts and commands.
Another
fascinating aspect of their lives is that they consume metals for nutrition.
The metals are dissolved and distributed around the body to feed their alloy
base. If a single metal is consumed in larger quantities the outer skin of the
Cyionic becomes saturated with that metal. The metal’s properties apply to the
Cyionic which has its upsides and downsides.
They live
on top of narrow mountains called “Sky islands” by the Biomaton. Cyionic and
Biomaton share a continent but are divided by height. Cyionic have no need for
interaction with anyone else but themselves. The Biomaton praise the
technologically advanced species as demi-gods.


The flora and the fauna of
this worldcan easily be confused since both have specimens who act as
the other. 
There is a great variety
in life forms, based on various base elements and structures: exo-skeletal
silicon based creatures; tree shaped mammals; metallic plants; reptilian quadruped plants;  acid-loving swarms of
flies; and rainbow colored plant sharks - just to name a few.

We have been working on several ideas including
- NFC chips in the base of the Miniatures for storing character information (easily accessible through a phone)
- Laser pointer tripod with changeable tip, projecting combat rulers for range weapons, grenades and mines etc.



- Mechanical, pressure activated, tiled platform which can be arranged and rearranged with several types traps (under the tile). Acts as a booby-trapped dungeon.
- A Camera + Projector device which will:



Scan the battlefield from above


Project it on a computer screen


GM can then project combat rulers directly onto the battlefield


Can also place hidden landmines that will not be projected on the field until someone walks into its range.


We know these ideas sound overly ambitious but they are not impossible.




We are prepared to ship out as soon as we have the plastic figures. But the book itself will not be ready. We have many new illustrations to make and will refine the systems with your help. 
Check out our twitch channel @ www.twitch.tv/MeKhanIXtv
And since we want YOU to be part of this process, we have decided to ship the game in a two phases.
Phase 1: Estimated Delivery – between February and April 2016
We will ship all the plastic models immediately after production. You will also receive a pdf file containing the latest systems so you can playtest with us and give us your feedback.
Updates to those systems will be resent by email on a regular basis.
Phase 2: Estimated Delivery – August 2016
Ship out the Core Manual and paper materials as soon as they are ready.


                Risk and Challenges

As a start up company we know that mistakes will be made along the way. We feel confident that no unnecessary delays will occurs since we will be manufacturing our products locally with the help of a experienced plastic manufacturer and book publishers. We can not outsource the game since we will be expecting the utmost quality. Rest assured we are working with professionals who will guide us through difficulties.
Our Core Manual however is more susceptible to delays due to proof reading, editing and most importantly adequate artwork and content structure. We want only the best for outr contributers! Because of that we have decided to send regular updates of the manual on PDF to all that have contributed beyond the ""Core Manula + Dice perk"", that way you can not only track our progress, but also play along with us.

<br/><br/>3 years ago we were playing online games in absolutely different world places and did not know each other. We met in social networks of online games - we not only played games, <b>we dreamed of contributing to the world of games.</b>
<br/><br/>There was some inherited driver that finally let 5 smart people gather in one place. Dedication that each member of the team shown was tremendous. We were «sleeping» with the Game.

<br/><br/>What basically distinguished us from other developers - was that each of us has only essential knowledge of design, programming, engine development, 3D models, texturing, animation, story writing. Except for our «Big Brother» - <b>John Warkit</b> who was the founder, soul and the heart of our team.

<br/><br/>We gathered to make a dream possible, to prove that dedication to follow the dream can cross borders, unite people, overcome difficulties, reach targets.
<br/><b>We wanted to add fun and laughs to people's stressful lives.</b>
<br/><br/><br/>
<div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #ff4b46;"">How Many People Are On Our Team?</div>
<br/>
The team consist of <b>8 people:</b> 2 developers C#/Java, 1 engine master, 2 Modellers &amp; Animators, 2 designers, and 1 Project manager. 
<br/>5 team members are full-time and 3 are part-time.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435922948/qvqrokthurgcndkhzihz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><br/>
<div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #ff4b46;"">Who Funded The Development Before?</div>
<br/>We paid for everything by our own cash: we rented office for two years, purchased computers, software, licenses, servers, office equipment, etc. We tried to spend less on human needs and put all the saved to the Game. <b>Be sure that we used all our resources but we finally need help.</b>
<br/><br/>Two years of development consumed almost all our financial resources. 

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435922911/nz0ybdy1e1dlhxlzqyct.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><br/>
<div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #ff4b46;"">We Have Nothing More, But Only This Great Fantasy Game.</div>
<br/><b>Every part of the game is well worked out during two years of hard work of our 8 team members.</b> We spent more than 10 000 hours working together and we are still full of enthusiasm to finalize the Game!

<br/><br/>An output should be amazing if you help us a bit!






<br/><br/><br/>
<div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #ff4b46;"">We Need Your Help!</div>
<br/><b>Please help us to our goal of $40,000! </b>
This will really help us make the final effort to make a deeply elaborated fantesy game which will be able to play 
<br/><b>ABSOLUTELY FREE</b> for people of <b>ALL OVER THE WORLD</b> in several languages.

<br/><br/><b>NO CLIENT PROGRAMS to DOWNLOAD</b>, the Game will be available 
<br/>to PLAY DIRECTLY FROM BROWSER.






<br/><br/><br/><div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #ff4b46;"">Glimpse Of The Work That Needs To Be Done:</div>
<br/>The $40,000 will be used to fund the final expenses to launch the Game.
And to say the least, we are more than excited to make this!
 
 
<br/><br/>Be sure that every your contribution will find exact place in our game:


<ul>
<li>we will make the final compilation of the game engine</li>
<li>we will buy hardware parts for servers necessary to support fast play of many people simultaneously</li>
<li>add new 3D models of monsters, weapons, armor sets</li>
<li>pay for sounds from composers and additional drawings from artists</li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>
<b>Target Funded:</b> All mentioned over here will be finalized.

<br/><br/>
<b>Acceleration:</b> More fun, laughs, adventures, and team play with more locations, monsters, items, music, fantasy drawings, events.

<br/><br/>
<b>All Plans Come To Life:</b> All our fantasy ideas (believe there are a lot of them) that we wished to see in the Game will be created and added to Demonest.


<br/><br/><br/>
<div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #ff4b46;"">When Will We Launch Demonest If We Get Funded?</div>
<br/>We promise to start the game on the 1 of september 2015.
<br/>It could be reached after launching from here: <a href=""http://demonest.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://demonest.com</a>
<br/><br/><br/>
<div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #ff4b46;"">Contribution Perks Delivery Schedule!</div>
<br/>We appreciate everyone who contributes to our goal to finalize the Game which, again, will be FREE TO PLAY.

<br/><br/>Perks <b>Undying Respect</b>, <b>Sword of Triumph</b>, <b>Sword and Shield of Triumph</b>, <b>Ascension of Triumph</b> and <b>Karhar Armor</b> will be available from the very first day of launching the Game (1st of September 2015).

<br/><br/>Owners of Perks <b>Personal Armor</b>, and <b>Legendary Pack</b> will get all gifts of all mentioned above perks starting from the 1st of September 2015, but specific gifts of these sets will be available from the 1st of November 2015 because we will need some time to create unique personal gifts for each contributor.

<br/>We would love to see new players discover Demonest and casual players get back into the Game!

<br/><br/>By creating the Game we eliminated all we think is stressful and left all enough for laughs. <b>We are making the game different and fun through new features.</b>
<br/><br/>After Demonest is started anyone will be able to get a fast fun of cleaning out the Kingdom from evil creatures which will definitely help reduce stress of hard working days. 

<br/><br/><b>Fantasy lovers</b> will be able to plunge in deeply elaborated 
fantasy universe with 5 struggling orders, 2 fractions of Janur and Dragfar, and the Darkness, whose evil creatures look for anyone stayed alive to make dead.




<br/><br/><br/>
<div style=""font-size: 28px; color: #ff4b46;"">«Big Work» Can Hardly Explain Shortly To What We Have Almost Done:</div>
<br/><b>3D FIGHTING:</b>
The core of the Game is 3D combat between players' characters and creatures of Darkness (PvE) which can be met on vast territories of the Kingdom and of course combats between players (PvP). 

<br/><br/>Use tens combinations of blows and cool options to outwit the opponent and win the battle! Beat terrible creatures wherever met in Demonest, achieve evil's lair on the North and engage with servants of Darkness, deserve glory and put your name in the Chronicle of Demonest.

Demonest saluts You!

3 years ago we were playing online games in absolutely different world places and did not know each other. We met in social networks of online games - we not only played games, we dreamed of contributing to the world of games.
There was some inherited driver that finally let 5 smart people gather in one place. Dedication that each member of the team shown was tremendous. We were «sleeping» with the Game.

What basically distinguished us from other developers - was that each of us has only essential knowledge of design, programming, engine development, 3D models, texturing, animation, story writing. Except for our «Big Brother» - John Warkit who was the founder, soul and the heart of our team.

We gathered to make a dream possible, to prove that dedication to follow the dream can cross borders, unite people, overcome difficulties, reach targets.
We wanted to add fun and laughs to people's stressful lives.

How Many People Are On Our Team?

The team consist of 8 people: 2 developers C#/Java, 1 engine master, 2 Modellers & Animators, 2 designers, and 1 Project manager. 
5 team members are full-time and 3 are part-time.



Who Funded The Development Before?
We paid for everything by our own cash: we rented office for two years, purchased computers, software, licenses, servers, office equipment, etc. We tried to spend less on human needs and put all the saved to the Game. Be sure that we used all our resources but we finally need help.
Two years of development consumed almost all our financial resources. 



We Have Nothing More, But Only This Great Fantasy Game.
Every part of the game is well worked out during two years of hard work of our 8 team members. We spent more than 10 000 hours working together and we are still full of enthusiasm to finalize the Game!

An output should be amazing if you help us a bit!







We Need Your Help!
Please help us to our goal of $40,000! 
This will really help us make the final effort to make a deeply elaborated fantesy game which will be able to play 
ABSOLUTELY FREE for people of ALL OVER THE WORLD in several languages.

NO CLIENT PROGRAMS to DOWNLOAD, the Game will be available 
to PLAY DIRECTLY FROM BROWSER.






Glimpse Of The Work That Needs To Be Done:
The $40,000 will be used to fund the final expenses to launch the Game.
And to say the least, we are more than excited to make this!
 
 
Be sure that every your contribution will find exact place in our game:



we will make the final compilation of the game engine
we will buy hardware parts for servers necessary to support fast play of many people simultaneously
add new 3D models of monsters, weapons, armor sets
pay for sounds from composers and additional drawings from artists




Target Funded: All mentioned over here will be finalized.


Acceleration: More fun, laughs, adventures, and team play with more locations, monsters, items, music, fantasy drawings, events.


All Plans Come To Life: All our fantasy ideas (believe there are a lot of them) that we wished to see in the Game will be created and added to Demonest.



When Will We Launch Demonest If We Get Funded?
We promise to start the game on the 1 of september 2015.
It could be reached after launching from here: http://demonest.com

Contribution Perks Delivery Schedule!
We appreciate everyone who contributes to our goal to finalize the Game which, again, will be FREE TO PLAY.

Perks Undying Respect, Sword of Triumph, Sword and Shield of Triumph, Ascension of Triumph and Karhar Armor will be available from the very first day of launching the Game (1st of September 2015).

Owners of Perks Personal Armor, and Legendary Pack will get all gifts of all mentioned above perks starting from the 1st of September 2015, but specific gifts of these sets will be available from the 1st of November 2015 because we will need some time to create unique personal gifts for each contributor.





 
 
 
 

What We Want To Give To The Community?

We would love to see new players discover Demonest and casual players get back into the Game!

By creating the Game we eliminated all we think is stressful and left all enough for laughs. We are making the game different and fun through new features.
After Demonest is started anyone will be able to get a fast fun of cleaning out the Kingdom from evil creatures which will definitely help reduce stress of hard working days. 

Fantasy lovers will be able to plunge in deeply elaborated 
fantasy universe with 5 struggling orders, 2 fractions of Janur and Dragfar, and the Darkness, whose evil creatures look for anyone stayed alive to make dead.





«Big Work» Can Hardly Explain Shortly To What We Have Almost Done:
3D FIGHTING:
The core of the Game is 3D combat between players' characters and creatures of Darkness (PvE) which can be met on vast territories of the Kingdom and of course combats between players (PvP). 

Use tens combinations of blows and cool options to outwit the opponent and win the battle! Beat terrible creatures wherever met in Demonest, achieve evil's lair on the North and engage with servants of Darkness, deserve glory and put your name in the Chronicle of Demonest.




ATMOSPHERE:
We prepared sounds and music to all locations and actions from bard songs to cementary fears, 3000 prepared images and interface elements, male and female main characters, 50 fully equipped and animated 3D mosters and raid bosses, hundreds of quests, fantesy stories and descriptions.






ITEMS:
Possibility to search for the best combinations of equipment from thousands of unique elements available in 3D, sets with extra bonuses of light or darkness stamp, totems, rare artifacts, armor and weapon sets and special magic items, spells, elixirs, weapons with spiritual features.



























CHARACTERS AND GAMEPLAY:
More than 150 parameters per character (male or female), more than 60 parameters per each weapon, hundreds of interconnected features and events defining the game process with non-linear story, balanced gameplay.
Ranks, achievements, reputation, skills. 
Ability to get resources, trade them with other players and NPC.
Communication with other players: chat, forum, social networks.
Experience peaceful or military style of the game. 




MONSTERS:
More than 100 monsters in more than 20 unique locations with different inhabitants and contructions such as marauders' camp, orcs' colosseum, rat holes, and many others. 20 parameters influencing the behavior of each monster. 
Social monsters summon disciples of the darkness at the moment of danger and attack together.
The closer to the evil's lair, the more terrible and dangerous creatures can be met.
Agressive monsters attack first without warning.
The more dangerous is the defeated enemy, the better armor, weapon or artifacts can be obtained.



TEAM PLAY:
Find friends and reach locations where only team players can defeat.
Win raid bosses and defend locations. Join already existing community or create your own clan.










Develop clan halls, get clan resources, create clan weapons and armors, 
protect the honour of clan and fraction, participate in Clan Wars.

<div><b>The game won't be easy but you won't ever get stuck for hours, there will always be some other play style you can discover that will work more productively.  </b></div>

<div>I dream to make one of the most <b>focused</b> mob directing top-down <b>hack-n-slash</b> PVE + PVP only arena game,  To sum it up it's a wave survival, RPG, endless skillful arena brawl, the Diablo 3 pvp i've been dreaming about. I hope to achieve the epicness of battling in Diablo, the perfect timing from Dota and the epic spells of World of warcraft combined into one and hopefully more complex game, the thing i'm looking forward to is the browser based pvp matches. The game engine I use allows games to be run natively in web browsers so no plugin downloading is required.  I absolutely adore the mechanics in these games and are always looking for more unique ways of character specialization to put into the game, For me the more complex and the more different paths of character specialization the better the game is. (I have played allot of Warcraft 3 and most of the popular and unpopular custom maps.)</div>
<div>The mob directing, spec/build system is very unique in this game that's why we are also making it for other platforms that is not augmented reality. (It would be a waste if we didn't) We plan on making it for Microsoft Hololens and Google glasses.</div>
<h4 style=""text-align: right;"">-The game will also be ported to internet browsers (Non AR) so the epicness of the pvp in this game can be enjoyed straight on almost all browsers without needing to download a plugin!</h4>

<p>A good game isn't only a good story and graphics, but the unique mechanics that makes the gameplay. This was the most difficult challenge so all my energy and thought went into this.

The game is taking longer than expected and I'm running out of money, I need the funds for time to finish the game, more creature models, which mean way more waves and I need expensive plugins to make the game perform well on as most mobile devices possible. There is no music and little sound in the game yet and the user interface needs to be reworked from scratch.</div>

Be part and help make the first complex RPG augmented reality game. The game is almost done and promising to ship in June if it gets funded. The game will be made no matter what. I need your help because I really want to see this game in it's full potential and most importantly time to finish the game. I want to add much more waves, items, spells and make it as polished and epic as I possibly can. 
                          



Dispersion is an Augmented Reality RPG/Hack-n-Slash Survival Game for Android, iOS, Google glasses and Microsoft HoloLens.

It's a survival RPG where you have to slay wave after wave of high quality creatures by placing wards and traps to reach the end or as high level as you can. You must combine (or use alone in abundance) traps, wards, spells and perks to create a certain play style, be it long range kiting, permanent stun build or melee damage stacking. 
                     

                          
15% tower defense 85% Hack 'n Slash 
100% RPG Customization 


                           

It's a RPG in the sense of wide character customization but not only in STATS,  in different play-styles and character builds to specialize  your character in the best way you think. 



Knowing what every creature on the map is going to do, quickly planning future abilities and attacks and coming up with new play styles that works out the most effective is all what this game is about!
 Casting epic spells on your desk. What more do you want?

       

Thanks to augmented reality technology the game makes use of your smartphone's camera to scan and track the environment and then physicaly place virtual characters on your desk, lawn or wherever you choose! The characters are fixed on the surface so you can use your camera to look all around them as if they were actually there. 







There must find the most efficient, practical and productive build/way of playing to specialize in your own unique field.

                

The game won't be easy but you won't ever get stuck for hours, there will always be some other play style you can discover that will work more productively.  

I dream to make one of the most focused mob directing top-down hack-n-slash PVE + PVP only arena game,  To sum it up it's a wave survival, RPG, endless skillful arena brawl, the Diablo 3 pvp i've been dreaming about. I hope to achieve the epicness of battling in Diablo, the perfect timing from Dota and the epic spells of World of warcraft combined into one and hopefully more complex game, the thing i'm looking forward to is the browser based pvp matches. The game engine I use allows games to be run natively in web browsers so no plugin downloading is required.  I absolutely adore the mechanics in these games and are always looking for more unique ways of character specialization to put into the game, For me the more complex and the more different paths of character specialization the better the game is. (I have played allot of Warcraft 3 and most of the popular and unpopular custom maps.)
The mob directing, spec/build system is very unique in this game that's why we are also making it for other platforms that is not augmented reality. (It would be a waste if we didn't) We plan on making it for Microsoft Hololens and Google glasses.
-The game will also be ported to internet browsers (Non AR) so the epicness of the pvp in this game can be enjoyed straight on almost all browsers without needing to download a plugin!


                          


Just imagine  wave after wave of intricate creatures on your table by skillfully 

selecting the most effective combination of 

abilities and traps, !
                 

You can view the game close-up, from a distance or from an angle. You have the camera to the spirit world.






Only if you go all out in one character specialization using a combination of traps,wards, perks and spells will you be able reach the end.

A few examples are a pure range dps build, a regenerating melee build, a kiting build or choose a  perfect complementary balance it's up to you!

Pop these creatures out literally anywhere, on your floor, couch, bosses table, (don't worry he won't be able to see them) (unless he also has the game installed on his phone, and helps you battle hordes of creatures on insanity mode)

                                       
There is bound to be over-powered combinations but they will be extremely difficult to find.





  Use gold, buffs, spells or melee/range (alone or in combination) to create
the most effective top-down hack 'n slash slayer ever!
  Random perk level up system.


  It's an intricate hack 'n' slash game that takes place in reality.

  Choose how you want to play kite, cast, range dps or melee with a  combination of wards, traps, spells and perk abilities. 




Each monster has its own way of fighting, thinking and has a unique personality.   Members of the same species or origins will work together while staying neutral to other species, but all still hating your guts of course.





                    
Every level you gain, you get to choose one from a set of 6 random perks that gets selected from a huge pool (similar to the survival epic Crimsonland) They consist of instant buffs, wacky risky perks and passives that last you through the game. Spells will pop up as an onscreen button.                                



                                               

After each level up you can also choose 2 of 4 benefits to add to your characters Health, Intellect, Strength or Gold. 



You can buy and upgrade your wards and traps with gold. which you get from killing monsters, perks and other subtle ways. You get traps that hook, launch, slow, burn, banish, teleport or amplify damage received  (and that's not even mentioning wards!)
Create a permanent stun,slowing range, damage per second, life steal or place money generators everywhere and kite them all around till you have enough for a few incendiary mines. 

             


An example of one build is that you won't use any of the damage capabilities of traps, but only amplify your characters damage, or use slow and stun traps and cast spells from a distance. 


                              


AAA Quality Models
Squint your eyes and make the two images one to see it in 3D



""I was playing on the floor and my friend walked pass and I shouted wait!! you're gonna step on them...""  I felt really silly after that -Anita Tromp
It get's that immersive, after a while it literally feels like they are really there! 
                                                       
The Tale of Dispersion
Dispersion is about a hero who’s trapped between the spirit world and our everyday world. To everyday folk like you and I, these demonic creatures are invisible. His phone somehow got corrupted while building an app, that made him able to see spirit creatures. He then somehow who knows how got trapped between the two but luckily the app still exists. It's up to you to use the cursed app and guide him to the final wave and kill Tyrkul for his fractal stone so he can use it to return to this word once more and forever shifts-deletes this horrible app.  

-Image Tracker
To activate the augmented reality feature, you simply print out the image tracker on an A4 piece of paper and point your phone or tablet at it.
Thanks to recently invented technology the tracking algorithm software such as Vuforia's SDK and deferred lighting, rendering is far better than years ago.


 Anywhere touch joystick buttons.

 User interface scales with screen size resolution.

 Extended tracking so the image target doesn't always have to be in view.

 Using vision-based computing.


 No in-app purchases ever.



                      

Just a few random perks you can choose after each level up:




Campaign Perk 5 (Assassin Daggers) 
You and only people choosing this perk will receive a pair of these bad boys. They slot in nicely next to your boots. They come with a UI button which you can cast a exclusive ability: fan of knifes.  







Campaign Perk 6 (Signed Poster)
You can also use this poster as a tracker for the game! The game world will appear much larger than using an A4 paper tracker.



Campaign Perk 8 (Special Minion 'The Baby')
You will receive a minion baby that follows you around. He will have no effect on the game except with the last boss.




              


Campaign Perk 10 (Krasue Companion + Unique Perk)
She will follow you around.  She has one buff ability and Haunting Scream.



It's game mechanics that makes a game good!
A good game isn't only a good story and graphics, but the unique mechanics that makes the gameplay. This was the most difficult challenge so all my energy and thought went into this. At the end it came out as I dreamed, with a creative and skilled character building system with different unique ways of playing.



The game is taking longer than expected and I'm running out of money, I need the funds for time to finish the game, more creature models, which mean way more waves and I need expensive plugins to make the game perform well on as most mobile devices possible. There is no music and little sound in the game yet and the user interface needs to be reworked from scratch.




$ 2,200 for high quality models.


$ 1,150 for plugins. I need plugins to optimize the models for mobile e.g. a plugin to merge all the materials into one so there is 1 draw call instead of 50 and Vuforia the SDK to make it Augmented Reality costs $500 alone.


$ 650 User interface framework and 2D artwork for the UI.


$ 1,500 for Unity Pro to have real time soft shadows, no slash screen and to basically have better graphics, so it will run smoother and so the final game file will be smaller.


$2,400 Time

$800 Music score and sound effects.








$10 000 Goal Reach I will make the game with an awesome detailed environment (so it won't be Augmented Reality) and port it also to Windows Phone 8, Blackberry, PC, Mac, PS Vita, PS4 and Xbox ONE/360 . We think the player vs monster mechanics is just so intricate and the amount of spells that already exist in the game not to also make the game playable in other formats.

+ Special mode where you can can train any creature on any wave level that will be by your side throughout the game. He will level up with you, battle and help you when you are in need.
$15 000 Goal Reach 
+ Online and local multiplayer (PvP and Co-Op) will be implemented as well as many more creatures, spells and waves. I have never done any multiplayer so I have to learn that from scratch.  I can only imagine how awesome it must be playing with your friend on your coffee table.

$20 000 Goal Reach 
Once I reach this I will take 2 weeks and make a step by step tutorial on how I made this game for absolute beginners and give it to ALL BACKERS.  I will give you links to where you can get the plugins, free software and free 3D animated models. You will basically be able to make a very small version of this game in a week or so i'm not joking it's that easy. (Will also give you all the character control and attack scripts so you can just import those)

<p>Hey team! We're doing an Indiegogo campaign to supplement our Kickstarter funding. The game's being made but we fell a little short of a stretch goal everyone seemed to want. So our promise is this: if we hit £3,000 on Indiegogo we'll make two games instead of one, and all our backers (both here <i>and </i>from Kickstarter) will get this new 8-bit version of the game, <i>Chime Flat</i>, for free.</p>

<p>Before we say anything else this is important: <b>we've already built a working demo of Chime Sharp</b>. Go and play it! And definitely, definitely come back when you're done, because if you back us right now you'll get a downloadable two (imminently three!) level demo featuring Chipzel and Andy Hung.</p>

I'll keep this brief: In 2009 I directed a brilliant game called <i>Chime</i>. Now we've Kickstarted a sequel, which we're building with the help of our brilliant backers -- and if enough people join us here on Indiegogo we'll make a second chiptune / 8-bit version of the game, <i>Chime Flat.</i><br/>

<i>Chime</i> is a music puzzle game, initially prototyped by ""The Lab"", a team I ran while I worked at Zoë Mode.

<p>OK. Good question. I've been playing the ""hypothetical sequel to <i>Chime</i>"" game in my head for five years. As soon as the chance to do this arrived I knew exactly what I wanted:  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Chime Sharp</i> needs new music (How many? Minimum 12 new artists, 12 new grids)</li>
<li>
<i>Chime Sharp</i> needs a new aesthetic (It does? Sure: blocks don't have to be boring, and neon is <i>so</i> 2009) </li>
<li>
<i>Chime Sharp</i> needs new rules and ways to play (What are they? Hm. I have some ideas, but we need some time to try them)</li>
</ul>
<p>The last bullet point is a bit vague, I know. I can be more specific: I want to fix some of the things I still find broken and dissonant in <i>Chime</i> -- balance the Fragments, encourage Perfect Quads, improve the relationship between the music and the game -- and try some new rules too. That's the part of the future I can't see yet. I'd like a ruleset that removes the timer, I'd like a shorter form of the game, but we need some space to see what works, and that isn't as simple as it sounds. The most important thing is to not break what makes <i>Chime</i> Chime. </p>
<p>So: <i>Chime Sharp</i> will be a prettier version of the game that everyone loves, distilled, with extra game modes and all new music. And again, you can already get a glimpse by playing the demo you've already played. Right? RIGHT? Right.</p>

The game's being made but we fell a little short of a stretch goal everyone seemed to want. So our promise is this: if we hit £3,000 on Indiegogo we'll make two games instead of one, and all our backers (both here and from Kickstarter) will get this new 8-bit version of the game, Chime Flat, for free.

Before we say anything else this is important: we've already built a working demo of Chime Sharp. Go and play it! And definitely, definitely come back when you're done, because if you back us right now you'll get a downloadable two (imminently three!) level demo featuring Chipzel and Andy Hung.

OK. Hi. I'm Ste. I'll keep this brief: In 2009 I directed a brilliant game called Chime. Now we've Kickstarted a sequel, which we're building with the help of our brilliant backers -- and if enough people join us here on Indiegogo we'll make a second chiptune / 8-bit version of the game, Chime Flat.



Chime is a music puzzle game, initially prototyped by ""The Lab"", a team I ran while I worked at Zoë Mode. People have compared it to Lumines, but I always describe it as part-sequencer, part-Tetris. You place pieces on a grid and those pieces are read as sounds by a beatline. As you tessellate the pieces to cover the playfield you both augment and progress through a piece of music. 



Gamespot called it ""captivating and inventive""; IGN said it was ""easy to get sucked into""; and I gave it 7/10 on my radio show, the highest score we've given anything! How's that for ethics?

You can party up with friends and take them with you into instanced dungeons,raid strongholds with them, or just patrol the wasteland together.Challenges Our number one challenge is creating a top quality game that will stand the test of time, while being on a tight budget. It is crucial that we raise this money to expand our contracting of different portions of the development process.Funding Goal What we need is base sum of 50,000 dollars to contract out more individuals that can build upon our weaknesses. That way we can bring the quality you deserve. The more money we raise the better the end product will be.You are the keyWithout you guys none of this would be possible. That is why each week we plan to give you, the backer, a detailed report of everything that we have accomplished. That way you will be able to give to us your thoughts and concerns about each new addition we add to the game!Other Ways You Can Help Spread the word about When Darkness Falls! Every message you send or conversation you have about our game will give us another opportunity.Future GoalsWith this ever evolving world we are creating, we plan to eventually bring this title to both the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One! Along with the ability to bring fresh, new features to the game each month.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

 Tech Demo as Proof of Concept   We developed tech demo as a proof of concept to show you what we mean saying ""game mechanics based on physics"". There you can fight against your friend or a bot, or just make bots to fight each other. Movements creation interface in this demo is only for developers and testers.   This is an online physical based robots fight simulator, where you create movements and strikes for your robot. The robot consists of more than 20 different modules. Your role is to be the operator, the coach, the manager, and the mechanic of all your robot-fighters.   Movement freedom! Each player can create any movement or strike and use it in a battle. That gives everyone the opportunity to create his own fighter with a unique fighting style. After all, ""the frog strike"" or ""double strike to the head"" at a special angle can give a great advantage when your opponent does not expect this.     Create your own fighter! Each robot consists of 20 items, which carry different characteristics. Now more than 100,000 combinations of robot assembly are available, without taking colors into account . This allows the player to create both internally and externally, a completely unique fighter!    Maximum control! The game has a traditional keyboard and gamepad control, and we developed a unique voice control system that will allow you to manage your fighter by voice, because remembering and saying the name of the hit that you came up with is easier than finding the needed buttons among dozens of options.   Real physical system! We have developed a unique physical system that allows you to animate the robots, and create movements and strikes for them. It also determines the outcome of the battle as well. The skeleton of the robot consists of simulated rigid structures, joints, tendons and muscles. No ragdolls!   The collision system runs in full accordance with physics. Each strike has a realistic model, which takes into account the mass and the velocity of each limb from head to toe. A properly delivered blow is the key to a victory!    The physics smoothly works at frequency 60 ticks per second. And it's possible already at the stage of tech-demo (wich is actually a proof of concept). And don't worry about the fact that the game might not work on your average computer - our approach is to simulate the battle on the server side, which also largely eliminates cheating.   Strike variability! You can create your own strikes, and what is more you can vary them in a fight. Any strike can be modified by crouch stands and lunges that can change the momentum of a fight radically.

   Jumps and kicks! What fight runs without kicks and jumps? All this will certainly be in our game. As well as grabbing the opponent by claws and tearing the limbs.    VR ready! We have made some tech tests and it was absolutely amazing! So, yes, the game definitely will have a VR mode and VR league!   About the League Structure

In the official leagues all the fights are by the rules, where a gamer gets money and glory for a fight he has won. He can become a champion step by step.   The Non-official league is different. There are no rules and money is not important – only the construction of your robot is important. Power rules there – if you lose the fight, you lose everything. Every league consists of 20 subclasses, which depend on your game skills. In the game you will also find a system of clubs and fights between clubs, where gamers can train with each other and create official fights between clubs. 

 Game Story
   2067. People live in a world where robots are widespread in all spheres of life from housekeeping to labor at the factory. People don’t even fight themselves, they use robots. 
   Cyber sport has replaced other sports and young fighters come to the ring to prove themselves. GlobalTech Corporation, the leader in modular robot production, announces an annual robot fight tournament. The prize fund is $100 million. Everyone wants to win the jackpot and the participants are even ready to cross the line. But time will show who is the best robot-fighter…

    Point Cloud studio was founded in 2007, and we have successfully executed a number of projects over the years. Our game developers are highly qualified and enthusiastic experts.   We noticed that the fighting game industry was in a crisis, as the games have become boring and there seemed to be no development trends. Being true fans of fighting games, we have come up with our own project - Voice of Steel - which promises to become a real breakthrough in the genre.  We need your support
   Everything you could see above are the materials from the game tech-demo, there is no CG.   We have passed Steam Greenlight in seven days, where we got a good experience and the vision of the further game development.   You, as backers, have a unique ability to influence the future game. Your money is your voices and assets, which will help us to make the game better! After the Indiegogo is successfully passed, you will tell the world that you want to see the new generation of fighting.   We offer you more than a chance to support the game and the genre – as the first backers you will get much more then the finished game. You will become a part of the club that will get early news about the game, early game plays and the backstage renewals. You can also influence the game from the beginning of its development.   Voice of Steel will cost $30 on the release, but we are offering it to you now for just $10.   Please, spread the word about us – tell your friends about the game and take part in early tests. An amazing world of robot fighting is waiting for you.

But those are mostly passive with my listening audience mostly doing basically that - listening. The vast majority will NOT take any action that will further their knowledge, which is a shame. And then 3 years ago it struck me...There's something that we carry around with us everyday. We look at it hundreds of times a day and we tap on it all the time. We look at it to learn new facts, and we tap on it to add our input or take some action.That something is our smartphone.And so the Life Changing Money Challenge game - The Game That Can Make You Rich And Famous - was born.
The Life Changing Money Challenge game is probably the BEST method you have to learn how to create wealth and multiply it significantly...It does this by making you both learn AND take action on what you've learned, at the same time.Sometimes the learning is done AFTER an action is taken.Other times the learning is done BEFORE an action is required from you (assuming you're paying attention, of course).Either way, you learn and become better in ways you never could before.At its very core, this game is a combination of the following:1.  Strategy and tactics that take place in your head as you log into the Life Changing Money Challenge web app to make certain important decisions on wealth building where you take some actions based on those decisions, by tapping some buttons - and then seeing if you're right or wrong within a short period of time. This is Phase 1;AND2.  LIVE interaction at a venue among all the players present where you’ll be wheeling and dealing with each other face to face to make the most money on your way to becoming the Champion. This is Phase 2. So what's your Net Worth? The Life Changing Money Challenge mimics real-life circumstances and market conditions that will help you create more “money” or increase your “Net Worth”, which is defined as the cash you have plus the market value of the assets you own. You will accumulate the cash and assets as you play the game. Some assets will accumulate automatically, others require some actions from you. Yet others will lose you money because they're not really assets at all, but you couldn't recognise it earlier.  Can you be the leader?Then you will get see the leading players on a Leaderboard in real time, so that everybody knows where they stand. This gives all players some goals to achieve.You can then take the necessary actions to replace one of the top performers on the Leaderboard, by checking what you're doing right, and what you're doing wrong.In the Leaderboard above, you can see that ""Stephanie Perry"" is leading with over LCD15.1 million (""LCD"" = ""Life Changing Dollars""), followed closely by Joshua Armstrong with LCD14.74m and Lester Weber with LCD14.48m. Joshua and the rest will have to figure out what actions they need to take to replace Stephanie in top spot. As they do this, friendships are created quickly. More importantly, this friendship is developed on a common interest (wealth building), so you're learning from each other even as you're learning from the game itself!The above shows the rest of the pack chasing Stephanie Perry for the top spot. Note that the LCDs are earned while the game is played, with the various tasks that you need to take that will also educate you on the wealth principles being revealed. Don't worry - you're completely safe.Far more important than bragging rights when you get to the top of the Leaderboard is that you will then know what it takes to create wealth, as you can SEE things happening from your actions (or inactions) - but without risking any of your own hard-earned money in the real world since you'll be playing with LCDs (""Life Changing Dollars"").With this knowledge of acquiring wealth and then successfully multiplying it all within the game, you can then immediately apply them to the real world when you're able to, to properly acquire wealth, and then multiply it for real.  That’s the simple objective of the game - and practically EVERYBODY who participated in this game absolutely LOVED it. We’ve done over 7 major live events of this Challenge with more than a thousand people playing the game in its various forms over the years, in total. Players attending one of the live events of The Life Changing Money ChallengeIn the process, we’ve created valuable opportunities for those who attended as they interacted with each other during the Challenge, and long after it’s over.And here's why we're running this campaign...You see, with live interaction at a venue, we can only reach those near the venue.This limits the benefits of the game quite significantly as the rest of the world cannot participate due to geographical restrictions. Since this game benefits you immensely by:
​Educating you as you play it so that you get to learn in a fun environment that mimics real-life conditions and not through dry textbooks; and  
Providing you with a VALUABLE NETWORK of LIKE-MINDED CONTACTS made up of other players who in turn can help make each other’s dreams come true long after the game is played;
we feel it’s important that more people in the world can get to play it wherever they may be, and at whatever time they wish.To do this, we’ll need to program the live interaction games at a venue in Phase 2 to add to the already-programmed Phase 1.As it now stands...1.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Isaac Silcox. I have been playing pen-and-paper RPGs for about a decade now, and video game RPGs since I could remember. I have always been in love with the idea of being a larger than life character, someone I couldn't be in the real world without being jailed or consuming a copious amount of hallucinogenics. I've sampled loads of different gaming systems, and tossed the advantages and disadvantages of them around in my head and with my even more experienced friends and gaming group.</p>
<p>I set about creating this campaign when I got to a point in developing Intrepid where I realized that some of my reach had exceeded my grasp. I am no artist, and didn't fancy including stick figures for all the class artwork, nor am I an exceptional writer. I maek misteaks alot! Being a brokeass twenty something with a bank account that makes the DOW Jones look more stable than my ex, I decided I needed your help. I just need a few bucks to pay some poor schmuck to draw some pretty pictures, and some other idiot to edit this hot garbage that I write. Without it, the world will only ever experience the SINGLE. GREATEST. ARE. PEE. GEE. EVER. as an open office document. Doable, but not as nice as a color pdf with some pretty pictures and pleasant formatting.</p>
<p>Donating will ensure that the project goes from a good concept, to a product that deserves to appear on shelves next to gaming titans. You aren't kickstarting an idea, the project is already underway and if support is shown, I'll gladly post updates as fast as I can make them. Once the project is finished, any and all can download it to their heart's content. Going over the asking donation will not only be a surprise, it will extend the depth of the game as I can afford to pay more people for more things, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here's the skinny:</p>
<p>I am asking for $500. That's enough to pay an artist I know to produce enough images for the classes, the cover, one or two set pieces, and the map. It will also subsidize my gullible roommate into editing the project while I feed him unhealthy amounts of Chinese food.</p>
<p>You want perks? Donating a whopping zero dollars/yen/gold/spacebucks/souls will get you a free RPG, the best perk anyone could ever get. However, here are some real perk things I came up with on the fly:</p>
<ol>
<li>$1 I will thank you and include your name at the end of the product.</li>
<li>$5 I'll think of you fondly while I do house chores and curse your enemies.</li>
<li>$10 I will write you a pleasant email or message lauding your generosity. </li>
<li>$50 I'll praise you visually through a custom-made video thing.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why is my project valuable? Well, it isn't. This is a chance to simply improve a piece of entertainment that you can own for free! Everyone loves free things! Is it important to the world? Probably not. At $750,000, I'll figure out a way to include a Last Starfighter design to find the greatest fighter in the world. That could be important to the world, right?</p>
<p>I have never done something like this before. Off-beat humor aside, I do have a lot of experience at creating pieces of content such as unique wargear, talents, campaigns, worlds, etc. These bits of creativity have resoundingly solid track record with familiar and new players alike, and I enjoy creating such things, sometimes almost more than using them. I firmly believe that GMs should create items tailored to their player's character, using out of the book items only as a last resort or as a foe's weapon, unless such items do fit a character already.</p>
<p>Okay guys, gals, and attack helicopters, I'm going to make this real for you. The classes are already made. The world is already drawn out. The world history is already written. Half the talents have been created. 95% of the skills have been finalized. Magic has a solid foundation to build on. Melee and Ranged combat have an even better foundation. I have a yellow notepad that is all busted up from over-use. I will post plenty of content once this page is up and running to prove it's real-ness.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risk: It doesn't get funded. Outcome: The product is still made, and your contribution still makes it better. Small chance that the contribution is instead refunded.</p>
<p>Challenge: Continuously producing and updating the product to meet growing demands, answering questions and solving problems raised by exposure to a larger audience. Stringent play-testing has yet to commence as I want to get the game in a 100% playable state before doing so, and increasing the sample size from my group of 6-8 friends who play to 637,429 people will present a lot of good insight.</p>
<p>Another challenge is ensuring that funds donated would be used productively and wisely. How much does a person charge for a drawing? What kind of drawing is it, how big is it, what form is the drawing in, how quickly is it needed? Those are all good question which I will have to carefully consider before spending any of money whatsoever. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Yo, if you can't donate a $1, that's totally okay! Lot's of us, myself included, have pretty tight budgets, and ""It's just a dollar"" attitudes can go out of control pretty quickly sometimes. If you aren't able to donate, maybe just give the files I will post a once over and see if you are interested. If you are, just share it on them there social medias or whatever! Or just tell your friend, ""Hey this jackwagon on the internet said to tell you his game was a-okay!"".</p>
<p>I also accept prayers accompanied by burning incense. </p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello, my name is Isaac Silcox. I have been playing pen-and-paper RPGs for about a decade now, and video game RPGs since I could remember. I have always been in love with the idea of being a larger than life character, someone I couldn't be in the real world without being jailed or consuming a copious amount of hallucinogenics. I've sampled loads of different gaming systems, and tossed the advantages and disadvantages of them around in my head and with my even more experienced friends and gaming group.
I set about creating this campaign when I got to a point in developing Intrepid where I realized that some of my reach had exceeded my grasp. I am no artist, and didn't fancy including stick figures for all the class artwork, nor am I an exceptional writer. I maek misteaks alot! Being a brokeass twenty something with a bank account that makes the DOW Jones look more stable than my ex, I decided I needed your help. I just need a few bucks to pay some poor schmuck to draw some pretty pictures, and some other idiot to edit this hot garbage that I write. Without it, the world will only ever experience the SINGLE. GREATEST. ARE. PEE. GEE. EVER. as an open office document. Doable, but not as nice as a color pdf with some pretty pictures and pleasant formatting.
Donating will ensure that the project goes from a good concept, to a product that deserves to appear on shelves next to gaming titans. You aren't kickstarting an idea, the project is already underway and if support is shown, I'll gladly post updates as fast as I can make them. Once the project is finished, any and all can download it to their heart's content. Going over the asking donation will not only be a surprise, it will extend the depth of the game as I can afford to pay more people for more things, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

What We Need & What You Get
So here's the skinny:
I am asking for $500. That's enough to pay an artist I know to produce enough images for the classes, the cover, one or two set pieces, and the map. It will also subsidize my gullible roommate into editing the project while I feed him unhealthy amounts of Chinese food.
You want perks? Donating a whopping zero dollars/yen/gold/spacebucks/souls will get you a free RPG, the best perk anyone could ever get. However, here are some real perk things I came up with on the fly:

$1 I will thank you and include your name at the end of the product.
$5 I'll think of you fondly while I do house chores and curse your enemies.
$10 I will write you a pleasant email or message lauding your generosity. 
$50 I'll praise you visually through a custom-made video thing.
$100 I will mail you a pair of my worn boxers with a sultry love note attached.
$250 I'll offer a blood sacrifice to a deity or pantheon of your choice.
Don't spend $500, that's just...that's silly. Plz. What more could I give after a blood sacrifice?

If the goal isn't reached, I will mourn humanity's miserly tendencies, and pay the difference out of pocket. This may or may not involve selling my body. Don't make me do that. If enough funds aren't accrued to legitimately improve the product (say under half the asking amount) I will do my best to return these funds to you, or spend it in a way determined by popular vote. I vote for burning it on camera in a Food Lion aisle.
*UPDATE* I have decided to convert the project into a do-or-die format. I feel like this is a gesture of trust to show that I am here to achieve a specific goal, not make off with whatever money I can scrape together. Unfortunatley, I can't change from Flexible to Fixed funding after the launch. If I don't reach $500, I will return every cent I receive and I will find another way to acquire the funds to get SOME art into the project. Now please excuse me while I go get sized for a balaclava.

<p>Broken Hammer Games is a small indie development team dedicated to Visual Novel development. Originally a group of friends and aerial adversaries within the Guns of Icarus community, we united around the community's visual novel project.</p>
<p>We are a collection of writers, artists, and musicians who hail from not only the USA but also Europe and Russia.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501577530/bux7cnjw86tsewuwaiwu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our goal is to make visual novels, the first of which being,""All is Fair in Dust and Air."" The project which brought us all together. Thus we established Broken Hammer Games in order to see it through.</p>
<p>This campaign is a dream project. For many of us this is what we've longed to do and been told we never would. Sometimes from teachers, sometimes friends, sometimes parents. Our name is a play on the Japanese proverb: ""The nail that sticks out gets hammered down."" Frankly, we're all tired of being hammered and so hence our name ""Broken Hammer"".  To break the hammers that have hammered us down.</p>

<p><strong>-The Dust and Air World</strong></p>
<p>All is Fair in Dust and Air encompasses each of the six nations of the Guns of Icarus world. Unlike traditional ""high school"" Visual Novels, our setting is much larger. In fact each story is a novel on it's own. How big is this world? Well lets look at the old Guns of Icarus map which we've based this tale on:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503259032/em2ffaissqidy2plavid.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In our story, you will be going to each of those great nations and discovering a world that has existed more in the background of Guns of Icarus Online.</p>
<p>Our stories spin more than a simple romance tale, but a tale of the turbulent world of Guns of Icarus. These are the stories of the people who live in it, not just the heroes who rise from it. They are stories of a world still very much rebuilding itself from an ancient war which decimated it.</p>
<p>This tale we tell seeks to bring to life this world, as we study the lore bits Muse has created, then craft our story from that. Every quote, every image, even tidbits Muse has listed in achievements within Guns of Icarus, have gone towards our story to help tell the best tale possible of this world.</p>
<p>Is it canon? That is up to Muse to decide. Our story will exist as a legend of a time within the Guns of Icarus world when these characters would have existed. A legend you will be able to shape to your liking with each story will offer multiple endings.</p>
<p>How you end up, and who you end up with in the world of Dust and Air, is entirely up to you. From tales of adventure, to tales of forgiveness. Then tales of revenge and justice. You decide your journey. A journey which starts right now with this project.</p>
<p><strong>-Our Characters</strong></p>
<p>While our overall cast of characters is well over 100 when you consider all the story arcs, our main starting cast is the one you see in the images on this campaign page.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>William Aven:    </strong></p>

<p>William Aven is the son of Eric Aven, a small time, but moderately successful, airship shipping company located in the city of Mole. Coming of age, he's looking to take his first steps into the world and find the destiny that awaits him.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Gwynevere Wrenfell:</strong></p>

<p>Gwynevere Wrenfell is the Baronetess of Ettingscove. The heir to Baron Wrenfell's fortune and lands.</p>
<p>​Ettingscove sits at a turning point in the affairs of the Baronies. Being the last surviving child of the Baron, Gwynevere's life is not the idealistic princess existence others dream of.</p>
<p>​The Fjordlands is a place rocked with cloak and dagger. An ally one day can be an enemy the next, and ""enemy of mine enemies"" is a way of life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Abigail Lalana:</strong></p>

<p>Daughter of a famous doctor and a horticulturalist, Abigail has had quite the unorthodox upbringing. Especially within a family that seems to be perpetually growing.</p>
<p>A genius prodigy inventor with an appetite for fixing things, Abigail is a rising star in Chaladon and has set the stage for her siblings.</p>
<p>​But peaceful times in the paradise of Chaladon will not last forever. Outside forces and politics will have their say in Abigail's future.</p>
<p>​There are even those within Chaladon who desire to ride the Lalana fame, or put an end to it completely.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Aoli Shi:</strong></p>

<p>If Abigail is a prodigy of invention, Aoli is a prodigy of air combat.</p>
<p>Daughter of General Yuan Shi of the Yeshan Empire, Aoli was born with a pilot cap on her head and a rifle in her hand.</p>
<p>Quick to action and fast on the reflexes, Aoli shines above all who pass through the Yeshan Military Academy.</p>
<p>But not all is perfect being sworn to an expansionist super power. True friends are hard to come by, and those who would seek to topple the empire are many.</p>

<p>Daughter of a Guild merchant who's business has seen better times, Sofia has been bred for the day she takes over the business.</p>
<p>Groomed in etiquette and the importance of body language in business, Sofia maintains a strong demeanor. She never lets her personal feelings dictate her actions.</p>
<p>Because of this, Sofia is already well on her way to succeeding the Aliyev family and restoring it's prominence.</p>
<p>But with prominence comes those who seek their own share of the grand fortunes to be had.  Whether it be from savages who attack trade routes, to rival businesses who plot and scheme behind pretty faces. Every transaction or deal brokered is a battle, and Sofia must become a master tactician of them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Calle Haldora:</strong></p>

<p>Where there are merchants and traders, there will be pirates.</p>
<p>Calle is no stranger to danger or to the criminal underworld. An inventive treasure hunter who always seems on the run from someone, Calle is certainly a most wanted individual on many lists. A true child of Anglea.</p>
<p>But is there more to her than meets the eye? The Haldora and Aven families have a shared history. One which is certain to bring Calle across William's path one way or another.</p>

<p>Your contribution helps us get all this off the ground and rolling. Our initial story (Which we call the Neutral Arc) that is currently in production, weighs in at about 30,000-40,000 words. This sets the tone and the branches for our main story arcs which weigh in much heavier. Some over 100,000 words each.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, many visual novels in the west tend to sit under 10,000 words or less and are often very short or simplistic. Literally their entire story fits within that allotment. Larger projects might go past 20,000 or 30,000.</p>
<p>However, our total word count at present is around 700,000. That includes branches and routes for each story arc for the six nations in the Guns of Icarus world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501149853/tjhshttwmfy3g4aaaay5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This total puts us well past big Visual Novels which have word counts over 300,000. We're within striking distance of even large AAA games with counts over 1 million. It is a word count you'd potentially see more in Japanese Visual Novels, not the west.</p>
<p>What we're attempting to do is challenge western visual novels. To not be defined by a cookie cutter mentality of creating visual novels, but to let our story go beyond what traditional visual novels tend to entail.</p>
<p>Thus our project has grown and gone from a labor of love to something that intends to challenge the status quo. To break hammers.</p>
<p>700,000 to us, is merely just another hammer to break.</p>

<p>We'd like to raise $10,000 based on current and near future needs. Can we do it with less? Absolutely. But will we do it as fast with less? Likely not. We're committed to seeing this story released no matter what. It's up to you how fast it gets there.</p>

<p>This is the biggie.</p>
<p>While our team has been working for awhile on our own, we need to be able to hire more to speed up the process. To be able to hire on extra artists would allow our lead artists freedom to specialize more on certain tasks.</p>
<p>We could also then look into hiring specialists for other departments that are in need of additional staff.</p>
<p>This would greatly advance the speed at which we can release not only this title, but the main story arcs.</p>

<p>Our current team members have been donating a lot of hours for free for years, all the while working jobs to keep the lights on, or finishing their educations. To be able to bless them for the work they've done, would encourage them greatly and free up more time to work on the project.</p>
<p><strong>-Funding To Get This Game Released</strong></p>

<p>Broken Hammer doesn't seek to lie about the challenges a project of this size faces. Our core team is committed, but life happens.

<p>So even as we build the introduction story now, we are already making final assets for the other stories.

All is Fair in Dust and Air - Alpha Demo Download Page
 


Broken Hammer Games is a small indie development team dedicated to Visual Novel development. Originally a group of friends and aerial adversaries within the Guns of Icarus community, we united around the community's visual novel project.
We are a collection of writers, artists, and musicians who hail from not only the USA but also Europe and Russia.

Our goal is to make visual novels, the first of which being,""All is Fair in Dust and Air."" The project which brought us all together. Thus we established Broken Hammer Games in order to see it through.
This campaign is a dream project. For many of us this is what we've longed to do and been told we never would. Sometimes from teachers, sometimes friends, sometimes parents. Our name is a play on the Japanese proverb: ""The nail that sticks out gets hammered down."" Frankly, we're all tired of being hammered and so hence our name ""Broken Hammer"".  To break the hammers that have hammered us down.


-The Dust and Air World
All is Fair in Dust and Air encompasses each of the six nations of the Guns of Icarus world. Unlike traditional ""high school"" Visual Novels, our setting is much larger. In fact each story is a novel on it's own. How big is this world? Well lets look at the old Guns of Icarus map which we've based this tale on:

In our story, you will be going to each of those great nations and discovering a world that has existed more in the background of Guns of Icarus Online.
Our stories spin more than a simple romance tale, but a tale of the turbulent world of Guns of Icarus. These are the stories of the people who live in it, not just the heroes who rise from it. They are stories of a world still very much rebuilding itself from an ancient war which decimated it.
This tale we tell seeks to bring to life this world, as we study the lore bits Muse has created, then craft our story from that. Every quote, every image, even tidbits Muse has listed in achievements within Guns of Icarus, have gone towards our story to help tell the best tale possible of this world.
Is it canon? That is up to Muse to decide. Our story will exist as a legend of a time within the Guns of Icarus world when these characters would have existed. A legend you will be able to shape to your liking with each story will offer multiple endings.
How you end up, and who you end up with in the world of Dust and Air, is entirely up to you. From tales of adventure, to tales of forgiveness. Then tales of revenge and justice. You decide your journey. A journey which starts right now with this project.
-Our Characters
While our overall cast of characters is well over 100 when you consider all the story arcs, our main starting cast is the one you see in the images on this campaign page.
William Aven:    

William Aven is the son of Eric Aven, a small time, but moderately successful, airship shipping company located in the city of Mole. Coming of age, he's looking to take his first steps into the world and find the destiny that awaits him.
Gwynevere Wrenfell:

Gwynevere Wrenfell is the Baronetess of Ettingscove. The heir to Baron Wrenfell's fortune and lands.
​Ettingscove sits at a turning point in the affairs of the Baronies. Being the last surviving child of the Baron, Gwynevere's life is not the idealistic princess existence others dream of.
​The Fjordlands is a place rocked with cloak and dagger. An ally one day can be an enemy the next, and ""enemy of mine enemies"" is a way of life.
Abigail Lalana:

Daughter of a famous doctor and a horticulturalist, Abigail has had quite the unorthodox upbringing. Especially within a family that seems to be perpetually growing.
A genius prodigy inventor with an appetite for fixing things, Abigail is a rising star in Chaladon and has set the stage for her siblings.
​But peaceful times in the paradise of Chaladon will not last forever. Outside forces and politics will have their say in Abigail's future.
​There are even those within Chaladon who desire to ride the Lalana fame, or put an end to it completely.
Aoli Shi:

If Abigail is a prodigy of invention, Aoli is a prodigy of air combat.
Daughter of General Yuan Shi of the Yeshan Empire, Aoli was born with a pilot cap on her head and a rifle in her hand.
Quick to action and fast on the reflexes, Aoli shines above all who pass through the Yeshan Military Academy.
But not all is perfect being sworn to an expansionist super power. True friends are hard to come by, and those who would seek to topple the empire are many.
Sofia Aliyev:

Daughter of a Guild merchant who's business has seen better times, Sofia has been bred for the day she takes over the business.
Groomed in etiquette and the importance of body language in business, Sofia maintains a strong demeanor. She never lets her personal feelings dictate her actions.
Because of this, Sofia is already well on her way to succeeding the Aliyev family and restoring it's prominence.
But with prominence comes those who seek their own share of the grand fortunes to be had.  Whether it be from savages who attack trade routes, to rival businesses who plot and scheme behind pretty faces. Every transaction or deal brokered is a battle, and Sofia must become a master tactician of them.
Calle Haldora:

Where there are merchants and traders, there will be pirates.
Calle is no stranger to danger or to the criminal underworld. An inventive treasure hunter who always seems on the run from someone, Calle is certainly a most wanted individual on many lists. A true child of Anglea.
But is there more to her than meets the eye? The Haldora and Aven families have a shared history. One which is certain to bring Calle across William's path one way or another.


Your contribution helps us get all this off the ground and rolling. Our initial story (Which we call the Neutral Arc) that is currently in production, weighs in at about 30,000-40,000 words. This sets the tone and the branches for our main story arcs which weigh in much heavier. Some over 100,000 words each.
To put this in perspective, many visual novels in the west tend to sit under 10,000 words or less and are often very short or simplistic. Literally their entire story fits within that allotment. Larger projects might go past 20,000 or 30,000.
However, our total word count at present is around 700,000. That includes branches and routes for each story arc for the six nations in the Guns of Icarus world.

This total puts us well past big Visual Novels which have word counts over 300,000. We're within striking distance of even large AAA games with counts over 1 million. It is a word count you'd potentially see more in Japanese Visual Novels, not the west.
What we're attempting to do is challenge western visual novels. To not be defined by a cookie cutter mentality of creating visual novels, but to let our story go beyond what traditional visual novels tend to entail.
Thus our project has grown and gone from a labor of love to something that intends to challenge the status quo. To break hammers.
700,000 to us, is merely just another hammer to break.



Simply put, money will be distributed where it is needed the most to help speed up our development process and release the Neutral Arc sooner.
We'd like to raise $10,000 based on current and near future needs. Can we do it with less? Absolutely. But will we do it as fast with less? Likely not. We're committed to seeing this story released no matter what. It's up to you how fast it gets there.
That said, this is where money will go:
-Hiring New Talent
This is the biggie.
While our team has been working for awhile on our own, we need to be able to hire more to speed up the process. To be able to hire on extra artists would allow our lead artists freedom to specialize more on certain tasks.
We could also then look into hiring specialists for other departments that are in need of additional staff.
This would greatly advance the speed at which we can release not only this title, but the main story arcs.
-Funding For Current Team Members
Our current team members have been donating a lot of hours for free for years, all the while working jobs to keep the lights on, or finishing their educations. To be able to bless them for the work they've done, would encourage them greatly and free up more time to work on the project.
-Funding To Get This Game Released
While the primary focus of this campaign is to get the funding we need to speed up production, any excess that can help us with getting this game released on Steam, as well as other gaming networks, will help.
The sooner we release, the sooner we have it on sale and can begin directing money from sales to where it is needed.
-Beyond The Neutral Arc
Funds in excess that aren't needed to get our initial story released, will be allotted to our story arc development and getting those jump started.
Beyond that, we will allot funds towards the aforementioned stretch goal like getting this entire story done with vocals, or ports onto other platforms like Mac, iOS, and Android.

Digital Goods:

These goods will all be delivered digitally. Game copies will require access to Steam to install. Please go to store.steampowered.com and make an account on Steam to play the games. Digital keys will be distributed after the campaign is finished. Date to be announced.
-Copy of the Neutral Arc

This is both the initial story and every story we have planned for development. Because delivering the story arcs will take longer, we are heavily discounting this for this campaign as a way of thanking you for wanting to see this project completed with us.
Game will be English only for the initial release.
-Guns of Icarus Alliance
This is the game that started it all, along with it's most recent COOP expansion. So you're actually getting both the PVE and PVP game in one. It is the framework we have built our world within. If you already have a copy, give it to a friend!
Quantities will be limited each week.
-Alliance + Costume Pack
Not only do you get Alliance, but you get a full costume pack to use in game to make your character look dashing and heroic as you cackle manically at your foe's demise! HA HA! Use mines...
Quantities will be limited each week.
-Balloon decal
Our own addition for Guns of Icarus Alliance. Drawn by our artists, this is a set of balloon decals based on our world and characters that you can use on your airships in game. The decals will be exclusive to this campaign until a later date to be determined.
Physical Goods:

To better showcase our talents, our physical goods will all come with a special limited art print designed for this campaign by our Lead Artist, Georgy Valerianov.
All physical items are limited in order quantity. Ship dates will be announced pending product completion after the campaign finishes.
-4x6 Scratch Pad (25 sheets)
This is our lowest tier item. Perfect for jotting down some notes with our special print background. Each pack of pads will include 25 sheets.

-Puzzle Magnet
This is a 5 and 3/8 by 5 and 3/8 in puzzle magnet. It features our art piece in a jigsaw puzzle you can put together anywhere the magnet will stick. So instead of a simple lone magnet, you get nine!

-Mousepad
This is a 8 x 9 and 1/2 in mousepad featuring our art piece of this campaign. It comes with a heavy duty open-cell rubber base material backing and a soft anti microbial fabric surface.

-Wall Scroll
This is a beautiful 26 by 16 inch Wall Scroll featuring the art piece of this campaign.

<h2>What is <a href=""http://ascendantreality.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ascendant Reality</a>
</h2>
<p>Ascendant Reality aims to be the next generation of Virtual Reality gaming and interaction engines. Using Virtual Reality mixed with several real-time inputs such as the Leap Motion controller the player will see and be a better version of themselves within the digital reality (open world). A MUCH better version. With increased strength, teleportation, force powers, possession abilities, flight ability and so much more! All while using your own hands in the game and your own motion. You will feel like a god. You will be a god. Please see the <a href=""http://ascendantreality.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website </a>for even more explanations on how it works!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Further Explanation</h3>
<p>Ascendant (rising in power or influence) Reality (the state of things as they actually exist), is a game/simulation where you control every aspect of reality. Like a god. This simulation revolves and evolves around VR, (Optional AR), and presence technologies. Giving you an experience and power you will have never before felt in your life. Every ability you can dream of contained in a massive expanse of a digital world. Filled with “Beings”. These beings adapt and evolve the more time you spend in the simulation and the more you do to the world. The literal fabric of reality changes with every choice you make. <br/><br/>Build for them and they will worship you, destroy them and they will worship you all the same… Until they start fighting back, building their own machines to take you down. They, however, do not know just how powerful you are, and as you progress the simulation, your powers too, will evolve. Making you bigger, better and a more powerful Ascendant. Some will always worship you, others, regardless of what type of Ascendant you are, will be against you. Beings will also fight amongst themselves, starting wars and battles that you can take part in or sit back and watch. The beings evolve their technology and ideas the more you play. <br/><br/>It is a hyper-realistic world with hyper-realistic controls and hyper-awesome abilities. Control the elements, control the people, mod yourself, fly, possess, dismember, harm, design viruses, the options are endless. (For a full list of abilities, read below in the “Engines and Suites” section). The time ratio is one hour of game play equals 24 hours in the simulated reality. Evolution will of course be accelerated; however, the same life mechanics apply and the more you have the game on the longer you are in this reality the more it grows, evolves and changes.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What makes it special</h3>
<p>Hyper realistic graphics and physics. With a full control over everything as the player. All graphics are powered and designed for next generation gaming and the physics is as precise as the real world, with the ability for the player to alter it however they wish, after all, a god should be allowed to do anything. Like for instance, turn gravity off, fly, make a person a point of gravitational pull and watch as everything around them get pulled to them like a magnet. <br/><br/>As all graphics are hyper realistic the animations had to be next level. Rather than using frame by frame animation, motion capture will be utilized to create the most life-like animations for in game realism. Natural motion by real people giving the player a more realistic digital world. Not only in movement but also in facial animations using newer technologies to create face to face realism in game. <br/><br/>The physics engine while allowing the player to alter any aspect of the world and bend it to their will also be hyper realistic for every other entity and assets in the game. From walls to cloth. Sporting a fully destructible environment and next gen cloth simulation allowing you to quite literally rip clothes off in segments. <br/><br/>Ascendant Reality will have several parental controls allowing the game to start at its base rating of M all the way to R18+. The reason for this high rating is because of the hyper realism, anything you think you can do you probably can, this opens up doors to a new kind of graphic level. Realistic dismemberment, increased strength and cloth physics applied to skin, these examples are just a hint at what you will be able to do and have it happen right in front of you with your own hands.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this idea a reality there are a few things required to get it off the ground. While running the simulation will not need a super super powerful computer, designing and developing it will. We have that, what we are after is developmental and testing hardware for the team to make the game fully compatible with Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and in time perhaps PlayStation VR. Alongside this we need a motion capture package, the cost has been brought right down not needing those super expensive Hollywood ones, however the ""at-home motion capture"" devices still come at a cost.  We will also be aiming to use several control inputs, or at least allow several this includes the LEAP Motion Controller, Myo Armband, Perception Neuron, Manus VR Glove and of course the controllers that come with the headsets. We are also looking to employ a part-time 3D animator.</p>
<p>If you look to your right you will see what you can receive for any of the tiers. Some even include VR Headsets, LEAP Motion Controllers and much much MUCH more! The hardware itself for each tier we aim to send out before even an Alpha is released so that you may have fun with it while we build the best Virtual Reality game out there! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Releases</h3>
<p><strong>Asylum</strong>: To showcase the graphics, storyline engine, spatial sound and game interaction this will be a small horror game that will have you at the edge of your seat! Expected release early 2018.<br/><br/><strong>RedWood</strong>: To showcase the graphics and immersibility of Ascendant reality a fully interactive explorable forest will be released. Show graphics, spatial sound and immersive interaction. Expected release early 2018.<br/><br/><strong>Simulat</strong>: To showcase the game mechanics and god powers in a low ploy cartoonish world, lots of fun! Expected release late 2018.<br/><br/><strong>Alpha/Beta</strong>: Alpha and Beta version of Ascendant Reality will be released over the course of development, no set dates but those that back the project get access to each to them depending on the selected tier.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge of this project will be time. However backers do get awesome rewards along this relatively lengthy timeline including copies of ""Simulat"" (Our base simulation environment to mess around with objects), Alpha, Beta and depending on the level you chose even the full game with VR and AR hardware (One tier even includes a computer!).</p>

<p>Story lines are complex or simple. Some tie in, some do not.</p>
<p>There are no bounds to a story line. Some will lead you underground, underwater or on the surface.</p>
<p>Beings can be merged (E.G vampire falling in love with a Werewolf).</p>
<p>This opens a plethora of unlimited story lines. Story lines are currently being written by handpicked individuals and looked over by our head of story lines.</p>
<p>CSI modules are point and click hidden object stories that let you explore the world and find runes or hidden characters. These will always unlock abilities.</p>
<p>Complexity is only limited by the imagination of the writers.</p>

To make this idea a reality there are a few things required to get it off the ground. While running the simulation will not need a super super powerful computer, designing and developing it will. We have that, what we are after is developmental and testing hardware for the team to make the game fully compatible with Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and in time perhaps PlayStation VR. Alongside this we need a motion capture package, the cost has been brought right down not needing those super expensive Hollywood ones, however the ""at-home motion capture"" devices still come at a cost.  We will also be aiming to use several control inputs, or at least allow several this includes the LEAP Motion Controller, Myo Armband, Perception Neuron, Manus VR Glove and of course the controllers that come with the headsets. We are also looking to employ a part-time 3D animator.
If you look to your right you will see what you can receive for any of the tiers. Some even include VR Headsets, LEAP Motion Controllers and much much MUCH more! The hardware itself for each tier we aim to send out before even an Alpha is released so that you may have fun with it while we build the best Virtual Reality game out there! 
 
Releases
Asylum: To showcase the graphics, storyline engine, spatial sound and game interaction this will be a small horror game that will have you at the edge of your seat! Expected release early 2018.RedWood: To showcase the graphics and immersibility of Ascendant reality a fully interactive explorable forest will be released. Show graphics, spatial sound and immersive interaction. Expected release early 2018.Simulat: To showcase the game mechanics and god powers in a low ploy cartoonish world, lots of fun! Expected release late 2018.Alpha/Beta: Alpha and Beta version of Ascendant Reality will be released over the course of development, no set dates but those that back the project get access to each to them depending on the selected tier. 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge of this project will be time. However backers do get awesome rewards along this relatively lengthy timeline including copies of ""Simulat"" (Our base simulation environment to mess around with objects), Alpha, Beta and depending on the level you chose even the full game with VR and AR hardware (One tier even includes a computer!).

Types of Beings and Their Abilities
Human – Normal and erratic, humans will worship you or they will be against you. Others remain neutral. They are erratic in a sense that they can get angry, will harm each other and you. Some will work together others will be individual.
Robots – Robots appear as machines and exist to help humans abiding by the three laws, as you are an Ascendant, humans can command robots to harm you if they wish.

Demons – Hells servants. Depending on what kind of Ascendant you are, they will either help, hinder or do nothing to you. They can however, possess humans. 
Angels – Heavens servants. Depending on what kind of Ascendant you are, they will either help, hinder or do nothing to you. The can heal humans.
Demigods – Demigods have god like powers. Not frequently seen but mostly can control one element, land or sea.
Super humans – Super humans are also not frequent but can control certain things, flying, speed, possession.
Vampires – Vampires only come out at night to torment humans. If you are a malevolent Ascendant they will not harm you unless provoked, if you are a benevolent Ascendant they will attack you unprovoked.
Werewolves – Werewolves remain neutral unless provoked and consistently hunt vampires.
Zombies – Zombies happen when it is full moon, night time and a person dies from a certain virus called “Zekerus”.
Aliens – Aliens come to earth and based on where they land and who greets them, depicts how they act upon the world and its people. (Help or hinder)
 
Storyline Engine
The Storyline Engine adds missions to the game. Doing them will unlock your certain hidden powers as well as gain you points that up your score to access powers that require a certain Ascension level.
Story lines are complex or simple. Some tie in, some do not.
There are no bounds to a story line. Some will lead you underground, underwater or on the surface.
Beings can be merged (E.G vampire falling in love with a Werewolf).
This opens a plethora of unlimited story lines. Story lines are currently being written by handpicked individuals and looked over by our head of story lines.
CSI modules are point and click hidden object stories that let you explore the world and find runes or hidden characters. These will always unlock abilities.
Complexity is only limited by the imagination of the writers.
If you would like to write your own story line idea and have a chance of having it in the simulation, please visit the website!

This is where Vanessa start her worst days ever, meet with a silent traumatic esper girl named Kara. Both must survive from the chaos, nightmare and distortions. They even  find themselves marked with Destined Symbols of Crossfate, triggering the next epic battle misery again after thousands years of a fake peace.
------------------------------------------------
There's many mystery to resolve. Many faction and sides that join the war, alongside with its people with their own mark of destiny and problems.
Led them into the battlefield and end this another tragedy with all of your might!
""In the arcadia, below  your destiny, the next doom prophecies filled with blank pages. Is it no hope? or it's a chance to write something new? you decide.""

Here's the image of one of the witch. This one kind of following trends from current age even the other still comfy with the old looks.

*) it said to have less magic armor resistance but it looks nicer !

Game will be developed in detail and packed with love. There might be parted in 3 main Arcs later.
And we, the developer team needs your supports to make this game finished as it must.
Every fund we receive, will be distributed to. . .
1. Game CG Arts
This game need a lot of epic and interesting art to support characters, moment and storyline. Some important event will be show a splash art like a visual novel to give certain impression.
And Etherim is a unique place and set, with Illusion forest in it, we need the background shown just like on concept. not to mention the ancient civilization and its ruins.

2. Soundtrack & BGM
To make the game more alive, we need good soundtracks, and for further development, important dialogue will be dubbed.
Below is the basic works of soundtracks of our development team.

We need more variation right, so why not start with supporting us to make this great! 
3. System Engineer
We're using customized plugins for certain feature, like nelow we have concept of party manager using cards with symbol of destiny. You'll see locked characters in shadow before you recruit them. 

This thing connected directly to storyline, where the destined individuals has been marked with symbols and a certain alchemist civilization make the prophecies based on this.
Another feature need to be worked with advanced plugin making skills, otherwise we will just focus on storyline and art if we didnt reach the goals.
4. Co-Writer
For your enjoyment follows the storyline. We dont want to make a bad impression with bad grammars on final built!
5. Animation Effects
A sets of specialized animation effects for the toppings!
6. Merchandising
Every backers will be rewarded fairly, and we might have another merchandise beside of shirts and wallpapers.. Maybe figurine, if we reach our goals!.

*)sample, you can choose later which character you want.

If the campaign success, we open option for .. ..
1. Opening animation
2. Exclussive comic
3. Crossfate Saga Novel

passionate game developers and gamers. We are a small indie studio based out of
Austin, TX. Our focus is to create and develop games that are driven by unique
game mechanics, interesting play styles, and games that can be picked up by
anyone, but mastered by few. Above all we are driven to develop games that are
all of these things and still fun to play for hours on end.

</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Siege the Day is our debut title, and a game we are excited
to be developing. We chose Siege the Day as our first title because it wholly
embodies the types of games we want to bring to gamers. This title takes a
different approach to the tower defense genre, and will focus on attacking
entrenched defenders, rather than simply building defenses. With no resource
gathering elements, a unique upgrade and building system, and dynamic map
generation, new challenges and strategies must be implemented in every match.
These game mechanics will ensure that players can find fun and challenges every
time they start a new match or play through the expansive campaign. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The team here at No One Famous Studios is incredibly small,
comprised of only 3 people, each working full-time jobs. We are ambitious
though, and have put every extra dollar and available hour we have into
bringing Siege the Day to life. There is only so much we are able to do on our
own, however. With your help through, we can bring a fully developed game to
market. A game that is unique, challenging, and above all just plain fun to
play.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466647829/Shield_aqvmbq.png"" src="""" style=""width: 26.1778px;height: 31px;""/><br/><br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Siege the Day is a real time tower offense game, reversing
the main role of standard tower defense games. Each match will feature a
dynamically generated map, as well as a limited amount of gold. Gold is used to
fund and upgrade units. Players will start with a majority share of this gold,
but will have difficultly acquiring more. These simple mechanics will require
players to exercise strategy, discipline, and cunning as they discover the
challenges they face in every game.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Siege the Day will also feature an original musical score. You can listen to the full theme song here:<br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FnStCzLOQCQE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnStCzLOQCQE&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FnStCzLOQCQE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><br/><p></p>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">Traditionally, tower defense games focus on players building
up defenses—usually between waves of enemies—to fend off an oncoming horde.
Siege the Day changes that and focuses on players building up armies and siege
engines, to unleash on fortified defenders in real time. While offense will be
a primary focus in the campaign, single and multiplayer matches will allow
players to take on a more traditional role of defense, but still in a real time
world.<br/><br/><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466647829/Shield_aqvmbq.png"" src="""" style=""width: 26.1778px;height: 31px;""/><br/><br/></p>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">One of the biggest features of Siege the Day is the randomly
generated maps. Every time a player starts a new match a new map is generated. These
maps choose a primary map type, and then build various terrain and biomes on to
it. Map biomes and terrain are comprised of various types, including: plains,
desert, forest, swamp, river, hills, mountain, and ocean. These various map
elements can be combined in an endless number of ways, and with each biome and
terrain having different effects on different units, they help create endless
potential challenges.

<div style=""text-align: left;"">If you are going to build siege engines, wood and stone are pretty important. If you are going to lay siege to the lands you are attempting to conquer, gathering materials like these is a given. That is why we decided to exclude resource gathering and generation in favor of one of the most historically important resources in siege warfare: Currency.<br/>
(Well that and food and water… which is a feature that might be included later on)

<br/><br/><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466647829/Shield_aqvmbq.png"" src="""" style=""width: 26.1778px;height: 31px;""/><br/><br/></p>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">Instead of a complex and timely generation system to obtain
the required amount of currency to invest in new units or upgrades, we opted
for a unique way to fund your sieges. Players will start with a large amount of
gold at the beginning of each match—based on the size of the playfield. Defense
players will start with much more gold than the offense players, to give them
an edge in building and setting up their defenses. All units and upgrades will
be available for purchase from the start of the match for both players. 

<p>The starting gold represents nearly all of the gold in the
match, and is extremely difficult to generate any other way. The only surefire
way to generate more gold is through defeating enemy units. This will grant
players a fraction of the gold their opponent used to purchase the unit. </p>
<p>This system is simple and easy, but requires much more
strategy than it seems. While players can upgrade units fully almost immediately,
this will completely eliminate their abilities to adapt to unexpected
challenges. If their fully upgraded charge is repelled, they are left with
nothing to continue on and will essentially eliminate themselves. <br/></p>

<p>Strategies will need to be developed based on both known and
unknown challenges. Challenges that will change with each map and each enemy.<br/></p>

<p>Siege the Day utilizes an upgrade system that complements
the currency system. Base units will have a divergent number of Unit upgrades that
will change primary features of the unit. Each of these upgrades will have specific

<p>Players are able to switch between different Unit types,

<p>We wanted players to be able to jump in to a game quickly
through either single player matches or multiplayer. For player who love a good
story and want to watch their actions effect their world, Siege the Day
includes an expansive and open ended campaign in which your decisions will have
consequence and effect on both you and the lands you travel. </p>
<p>The story of the campaign follows players, a lord and
protector of their lands. A threat to the realm has begun to develop. An
unknown army, headed by a person only known as the Conqueror has begun laying
siege to many of the neighboring lands. When this threat reaches your lands,
you attempt to repel them. Your efforts are in vain, as the Conqueror proves to
be too strong a foe. Impressed by your tenacity, and ability you are offered a
deal. To join the Conqueror in claiming and unifying the lands under their
banner. What lands will you conquer? What will become of their rulers? Are you
loyal to your new lord, or will you attempt to take the world for your own?</p>
<p>This campaign is one of major features we absolutely love
being able to include in this type of game, and are currently working on
fleshing out hours and hours of campaign game play to immerse players in a deep

<p>Siege the day features 5 main base units: Infantry, Archer,
Cavalry, Scout, and Siege Engines. Many of these units have various disciplines
that players can use and upgrade to create an army for whatever challenges
await. Each unit has specialties that will prove valuable to players in
different ways.</p>
<br/><br/><ul><li> <b>Infantry </b>units are the loyal foot soldiers of your army. The
most cost effective to purchase, and overall the most well rounded unit.
Infantry units can be trained into various close combat disciplines, including:
Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Spearmen, Pike men, and Phalanxes. </li></ul>

<br/>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Archers </b>are deadly ranged units that allow players to
inflict massive damage before an enemy even draws close. While susceptible to
close quarters combat, their various disciplines can prevent enemies from ever
getting close enough. Archer disciplines include: Short bow, Longbow, Light
crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, and Riflemen</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Cavalry </b>units are fast mounted units, designed to
destructively clash with other foot units and breaking enemy lines. They are
susceptible to the terrain they cross, but proper deployment makes them a force
to be reckoned with. Calvary disciplines include: Light Calvary, Heavy Calvary,
Dragoon, and Knight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Scouts </b>are the fastest units with the greatest sight. They
can search areas and track enemy movements quickly and efficiently. While not
fighters, if detected they can quickly escape through the land laying traps to
stall and damage enemies.</p>

<li>
<p><b>Siege Engines</b> are the greatest assets in any siege. Allowing
attackers to bypass fortifications with Siege Towers and Ladders, level masses
of enemies with Ballista, reduce walls and towers to nothing with catapults, or
inflict massive damage to personal and fortifications with cannons. These
instruments of war are costly to build, but invaluable in the field. </p>

<p>When laying out what we wanted to do with Siege the Day,
there were many ideas, stories, and content that did not fit into the core
development. Rather than leave these ideas behind we decided one of the most
ambitious things we wanted to do with the game is the inclusion of new content
after the game is released. Offering players new stories and features to
continue expanding on their immersion in the game. </p>
<p>What content and stories will be released after the game? We
have decided yet. This content will be developed after the game has been
released, and will not be a part of the core development process. Our primary
goal with this is to provide new short campaigns for players, to tell stories
that we feel fit in with the world but not the main campaign. We plan on
releasing this new content for at least 6 months after the game is released,
but would love to be able to do a year or more of additional content.</p>
<p>As gamers ourselves were not fans of paid DLC, which is why
this content will be added monthly, for free.<br/></p>

<p>As we mentioned in the introduction, No One Famous Studios
is a small team of 3 people. We are putting as much time and personal finances
into this title as possible, but there is only so much we can do on our own. We
are crowdfunding Siege the Day so that we can fully dedicate the time and
resources necessary to develop this game without cutting corners or features. We
want to provide a fully fleshed out and developed game, and we need your help
to make it happen.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, if crowdfunding is critical to the
development of Siege the Day, why we are asking for so little compared to other
video game campaigns. Simply put, the amount we are trying to raise is what is
needed to complete the core development. When we set the scope of what we want
this game to be; the features that we wanted to make sure were included to make
the game what it is, and we looked at what we could do ourselves, the whole of
this campaign is what is missing. </p>

We set this campaign to flex funding so that we
can put any funds we raise towards core development. Every dollar over our
original goal helps us fund additional features and content we want to include,
but we want to be realistic with our goals and transparent with our intentions.<br/><br/><p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466655510/Perks_aad8kc.png"" src="""" style=""width: 283.237px;height: 250px;""/></p>

<p><b>“Will this game
actually get released if I help fund it?</b>”</p>
<p>Yes. Without exception, yes. We know you probably have
worries about funding an unknown studio’s debut game, and you are not alone.
This was one of the biggest questions that we had to ask ourselves when we
first sat down to create this game. We determined what it would take and how to
make it happen from funding to development to distribution. It is one of the reasons we set this campaign
to flexible funding, so that no matter what your contribution helps us make
this game a reality. </p>

<p><b>“How do I know you’ll
actually release the game you say you will?”</b></p>
<p>We have maintained a scope of what we want Siege the Day to
be at its core. The mechanics and game play that make it the game we want it to
be. There are plenty of additional complementary features that we would like to
include, but right now the core gameplay we described here is our only focus. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466647829/Shield_aqvmbq.png"" src="""" style=""width: 26.1778px;height: 31px;""/><br/><br/></p>
<p><b>“Is this going to be
another game that is an endless beta or never leaves early access?”</b></p>
<p>No. Absolutely not. Never. By maintaining our scope of what
we want to do with Siege the Day we are also able to focus on the final
product. We have cut a plethora of ideas that just wouldn’t be practical or
would indefinitely extend development. If we want to add anything to the game,
it will be after release, and it will be free. </p>

<p><b>“Why are you asking
for so little? Aren’t games expensive to develop?”</b></p>
<p>They are very expensive, and we have been pouring as much of
our personal finances into the development as we are able. Ramen has helped. We
plan to continue to do that even after the campaign ends. We are just as
invested in this as you are, but we want to be realistic about our goals. The
reason we’re not asking for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars is because
it would be absurd. We don’t want to lose focus on our core development process
by trying to add new features because we can afford to. All our stretch goals
are things that we already want to include, and reaching those goals not only
shows us you want those things as well, but helps us fund their development. </p>

<p>Have a question, or confused about something above. We might
have explained or answer your question here:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>“Why are you asking
for so little?”</b></p>
<p>Two reasons. First, we are still putting our own finances
into Siege the Day. The amount were asking for is what we need to finish
development. Second, we are a small startup studio and this is our debut game,
we want to be realistic and not overreach or over promise. <br/></p>

<p><b>“Are you using any
game creation tool?”</b></p>
<p>Nope. Siege the Day is being created 100% from scratch. Even
the game engine was created by us.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466647829/Shield_aqvmbq.png"" src="""" style=""width: 26.1778px;height: 31px;""/><br/><br/></p>
<p><b>“Can I see more
gameplay?”</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! We’re premiering the gameplay at RTX 2016 here
is Austin, TX. If you’re going feel free to stop by and we’ll show you
everything. After RTX we’ll be uploading more gameplay footage here. <br/></p>

<p><b>“Your game doesn’t
look finished.”</b></p>
<p>I’d hope not, otherwise there wouldn’t be a reason for this
campaign. If you are referring the video or other media that don’t look like the
typical marketing material, that is because we have focused on mechanics and
gameplay so far, and the graphics are not quite to finished quality yet. <br/></p>

<p><b>“Why the cartoon like
style? Is this a kid’s game?”</b></p>

look to Siege the Day. Easy to approach doesn’t mean easy to master though. <br/></p>

this is a full PC title. <br/></p>

<p><b>“Are you going to
have micro-transactions?”</b></p>
<p>It’s common in games lately to have some element that is
micro-transaction based. We don’t want to have anything like that effecting our
game. The only micro-transactions we’ve even considered were for unique banner
symbols, and only so we could pay artists to create more.</p>

<p><b>“Are the $10,000 and
$20,000 perks real?”</b></p>

someone believes in us and what we can accomplish to that degree we would
absolutely love to hear their opinions and give them a voice in our future

<p><b>“Are you really going
to just buy chips if you reach $1,000,000?”</b></p>
<p>Possibly. Mostly we just wanted to show that even at such a
high goal we are keeping the scope of what we want to do. If we reach
$1,000,000 there is plenty of things we’d love to do with Siege the Day, plenty
of ideas we had to shelf we’ll revisit. But we don’t want to start promising more

<p></p></div>","The team here at No One Famous Studios is a small group of
passionate game developers and gamers. We are a small indie studio based out of
Austin, TX. Our focus is to create and develop games that are driven by unique
game mechanics, interesting play styles, and games that can be picked up by
anyone, but mastered by few. Above all we are driven to develop games that are
all of these things and still fun to play for hours on end.

Siege the Day is our debut title, and a game we are excited
to be developing. We chose Siege the Day as our first title because it wholly
embodies the types of games we want to bring to gamers. This title takes a
different approach to the tower defense genre, and will focus on attacking
entrenched defenders, rather than simply building defenses. With no resource
gathering elements, a unique upgrade and building system, and dynamic map
generation, new challenges and strategies must be implemented in every match.
These game mechanics will ensure that players can find fun and challenges every
time they start a new match or play through the expansive campaign. 
The team here at No One Famous Studios is incredibly small,
comprised of only 3 people, each working full-time jobs. We are ambitious
though, and have put every extra dollar and available hour we have into
bringing Siege the Day to life. There is only so much we are able to do on our
own, however. With your help through, we can bring a fully developed game to
market. A game that is unique, challenging, and above all just plain fun to
play.


Siege the Day is a real time tower offense game, reversing
the main role of standard tower defense games. Each match will feature a
dynamically generated map, as well as a limited amount of gold. Gold is used to
fund and upgrade units. Players will start with a majority share of this gold,
but will have difficultly acquiring more. These simple mechanics will require
players to exercise strategy, discipline, and cunning as they discover the
challenges they face in every game.Siege the Day will also feature an original musical score. You can listen to the full theme song here:


Traditionally, tower defense games focus on players building
up defenses—usually between waves of enemies—to fend off an oncoming horde.
Siege the Day changes that and focuses on players building up armies and siege
engines, to unleash on fortified defenders in real time. While offense will be
a primary focus in the campaign, single and multiplayer matches will allow
players to take on a more traditional role of defense, but still in a real time
world.




One of the biggest features of Siege the Day is the randomly
generated maps. Every time a player starts a new match a new map is generated. These
maps choose a primary map type, and then build various terrain and biomes on to
it. Map biomes and terrain are comprised of various types, including: plains,
desert, forest, swamp, river, hills, mountain, and ocean. These various map
elements can be combined in an endless number of ways, and with each biome and
terrain having different effects on different units, they help create endless
potential challenges.







If you are going to build siege engines, wood and stone are pretty important. If you are going to lay siege to the lands you are attempting to conquer, gathering materials like these is a given. That is why we decided to exclude resource gathering and generation in favor of one of the most historically important resources in siege warfare: Currency.
(Well that and food and water… which is a feature that might be included later on)







Instead of a complex and timely generation system to obtain
the required amount of currency to invest in new units or upgrades, we opted
for a unique way to fund your sieges. Players will start with a large amount of
gold at the beginning of each match—based on the size of the playfield. Defense
players will start with much more gold than the offense players, to give them
an edge in building and setting up their defenses. All units and upgrades will
be available for purchase from the start of the match for both players. 

The starting gold represents nearly all of the gold in the
match, and is extremely difficult to generate any other way. The only surefire
way to generate more gold is through defeating enemy units. This will grant
players a fraction of the gold their opponent used to purchase the unit. 
This system is simple and easy, but requires much more
strategy than it seems. While players can upgrade units fully almost immediately,
this will completely eliminate their abilities to adapt to unexpected
challenges. If their fully upgraded charge is repelled, they are left with
nothing to continue on and will essentially eliminate themselves. 



Strategies will need to be developed based on both known and
unknown challenges. Challenges that will change with each map and each enemy.







Siege the Day utilizes an upgrade system that complements
the currency system. Base units will have a divergent number of Unit upgrades that
will change primary features of the unit. Each of these upgrades will have specific
secondary upgrades available that complement the main features of that unit. 
Players are able to switch between different Unit types,
while still maintaining secondary upgrades. This change will cost players



Siege the day utilizes an upgrade system that complements
the currency system. Base units have divergent discipline upgrades that will
change major features of the unit. Each discipline having specialized secondary
upgrades available. Players will be able to switch between unit disciplines,
while maintaining all secondary upgrades. This allows players to choose the
unit and discipline that will best meet their needs. Switching between
disciplines will cost players gold, however. Requiring them to make their
changes very selectively. 







These two game modes comprise the easiest way to jump in and
start playing Siege the Day. Players can choose between playing either the
invading, army building offense or the fortifying, repelling defense. Single
player matches will feature against an AI at a variable difficulty that players
can set. Multiplayer matches will allow players to either challenge and battle
friends through direct games, or be matched with another random player to test
their skills against the world.







We wanted players to be able to jump in to a game quickly
through either single player matches or multiplayer. For player who love a good
story and want to watch their actions effect their world, Siege the Day
includes an expansive and open ended campaign in which your decisions will have
consequence and effect on both you and the lands you travel. 
The story of the campaign follows players, a lord and
protector of their lands. A threat to the realm has begun to develop. An
unknown army, headed by a person only known as the Conqueror has begun laying
siege to many of the neighboring lands. When this threat reaches your lands,
you attempt to repel them. Your efforts are in vain, as the Conqueror proves to
be too strong a foe. Impressed by your tenacity, and ability you are offered a
deal. To join the Conqueror in claiming and unifying the lands under their
banner. What lands will you conquer? What will become of their rulers? Are you
loyal to your new lord, or will you attempt to take the world for your own?
This campaign is one of major features we absolutely love
being able to include in this type of game, and are currently working on
fleshing out hours and hours of campaign game play to immerse players in a deep
and complex story. 







Siege the day features 5 main base units: Infantry, Archer,
Cavalry, Scout, and Siege Engines. Many of these units have various disciplines
that players can use and upgrade to create an army for whatever challenges
await. Each unit has specialties that will prove valuable to players in
different ways.
 Infantry units are the loyal foot soldiers of your army. The
most cost effective to purchase, and overall the most well rounded unit.
Infantry units can be trained into various close combat disciplines, including:
Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Spearmen, Pike men, and Phalanxes. 





Archers are deadly ranged units that allow players to
inflict massive damage before an enemy even draws close. While susceptible to
close quarters combat, their various disciplines can prevent enemies from ever
getting close enough. Archer disciplines include: Short bow, Longbow, Light
crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, and Riflemen









Cavalry units are fast mounted units, designed to
destructively clash with other foot units and breaking enemy lines. They are
susceptible to the terrain they cross, but proper deployment makes them a force
to be reckoned with. Calvary disciplines include: Light Calvary, Heavy Calvary,
Dragoon, and Knight.


Scouts are the fastest units with the greatest sight. They
can search areas and track enemy movements quickly and efficiently. While not
fighters, if detected they can quickly escape through the land laying traps to
stall and damage enemies.




Siege Engines are the greatest assets in any siege. Allowing
attackers to bypass fortifications with Siege Towers and Ladders, level masses
of enemies with Ballista, reduce walls and towers to nothing with catapults, or
inflict massive damage to personal and fortifications with cannons. These
instruments of war are costly to build, but invaluable in the field. 











When laying out what we wanted to do with Siege the Day,
there were many ideas, stories, and content that did not fit into the core
development. Rather than leave these ideas behind we decided one of the most
ambitious things we wanted to do with the game is the inclusion of new content
after the game is released. Offering players new stories and features to
continue expanding on their immersion in the game. 
What content and stories will be released after the game? We
have decided yet. This content will be developed after the game has been
released, and will not be a part of the core development process. Our primary
goal with this is to provide new short campaigns for players, to tell stories
that we feel fit in with the world but not the main campaign. We plan on
releasing this new content for at least 6 months after the game is released,
but would love to be able to do a year or more of additional content.
As gamers ourselves were not fans of paid DLC, which is why
this content will be added monthly, for free.




As we mentioned in the introduction, No One Famous Studios
is a small team of 3 people. We are putting as much time and personal finances
into this title as possible, but there is only so much we can do on our own. We
are crowdfunding Siege the Day so that we can fully dedicate the time and
resources necessary to develop this game without cutting corners or features. We
want to provide a fully fleshed out and developed game, and we need your help
to make it happen.
You might be wondering, if crowdfunding is critical to the
development of Siege the Day, why we are asking for so little compared to other
video game campaigns. Simply put, the amount we are trying to raise is what is
needed to complete the core development. When we set the scope of what we want
this game to be; the features that we wanted to make sure were included to make
the game what it is, and we looked at what we could do ourselves, the whole of
this campaign is what is missing. 

We set this campaign to flex funding so that we
can put any funds we raise towards core development. Every dollar over our
original goal helps us fund additional features and content we want to include,
but we want to be realistic with our goals and transparent with our intentions. 



We wanted to make sure that backers who support us are not just left wondering about the status of the development or backer rewards. Therefore, all perk levels over $15 not only get you a copy of Siege the Day, but also grant you access to the Development schedule we will be putting online and updating Monday - Friday. This schedule will allow you to track that progress of the games development. We are going to be adding a few more perks as the campaign continues, and we have several perks that will unlock as we meet our stretch goals. So make sure you check back frequently. We’re putting as much financing into Siege the Day as
possible, and with your help we can cover that last gap of funding required.
All funds we raise will be broken down like so:





Development
Costs: By far the biggest expenditure in developing a game. This is going
to cover the costs of things like testing servers so we can make sure
multiplayer works flawlessly, development utilities and services (electricity
is strangely important for computers. Weird, right?), and man hours (we might
buy a bag of chips if that’s ok.)



Distribution and Marketing: While we’re not above hand delivering your copy
and handing out flyers, it’s not really the most cost effective or timely
method. Funds here will help us get Siege the Day onto multiple platforms, and
get the game to as many people as possible.


Support and Services: We plan to be around patching missed bugs,
building new content, and ensuring multiplayer services work. These funds will
help us keep up with everything after the game launches.





Game development and crowd funding both come with plenty of
risks and challenges, and we want to make sure we address both. Not just risks
and challenges we face in development, but also risks you miht be worried
about. 

“Will this game
actually get released if I help fund it?”
Yes. Without exception, yes. We know you probably have
worries about funding an unknown studio’s debut game, and you are not alone.
This was one of the biggest questions that we had to ask ourselves when we
first sat down to create this game. We determined what it would take and how to
make it happen from funding to development to distribution. It is one of the reasons we set this campaign
to flexible funding, so that no matter what your contribution helps us make
this game a reality. 

“How do I know you’ll
actually release the game you say you will?”
We have maintained a scope of what we want Siege the Day to
be at its core. The mechanics and game play that make it the game we want it to
be. There are plenty of additional complementary features that we would like to
include, but right now the core gameplay we described here is our only focus. 

“Is this going to be
another game that is an endless beta or never leaves early access?”
No. Absolutely not. Never. By maintaining our scope of what
we want to do with Siege the Day we are also able to focus on the final
product. We have cut a plethora of ideas that just wouldn’t be practical or
would indefinitely extend development. If we want to add anything to the game,
it will be after release, and it will be free. 

“Why are you asking
for so little? Aren’t games expensive to develop?”
They are very expensive, and we have been pouring as much of
our personal finances into the development as we are able. Ramen has helped. We
plan to continue to do that even after the campaign ends. We are just as
invested in this as you are, but we want to be realistic about our goals. The
reason we’re not asking for tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars is because
it would be absurd. We don’t want to lose focus on our core development process
by trying to add new features because we can afford to. All our stretch goals
are things that we already want to include, and reaching those goals not only
shows us you want those things as well, but helps us fund their development. 

“What happens if you
don’t reach your goal?”
We keep working. It could take us years to finally complete
the game, but we will keep working until it’s done.



We are raising funds to help us complete the core
development of Siege the Day. Alas, this means some features we want to include
and think would make for an even more amazing game are just out of reach. We
wanted to give you a chance to help us get these features into the game. 

Reaching
$10,000 will allow us to include a customization option. This option will allow
you to create a battle standard to will be displayed on all of your units, and
to opponents in match making. Reaching this goal will also unlock perks for
unique banners that can only be accessed through this campaign.





We will now be able to provide monthly updates for up to 9
months. That’s 3 more months of free content. 




We have the equipment, we have the talent, and with this
goal we will have the funds to give voices to major campaign characters. Some
of these characters… well they will be so much better with a voice. 






Currently the campaign is set to be an expansive adventure,
but upon hitting this goal it will become even more in depth. New worlds, new
characters, and even more hours of play. This goal will unlock perks that will
give you the option of appearing in the game.





We can provide a full year of updates to Siege the day with
this goal. This means a full year of new content, new adventures, and new
challenges.





Myth units were one of the units we had to initially cut
when we started. Once we hit this goal these units are back into the game. Some
are walking siege engines. Some are devastating rangers. Some are absolute
tricksters. These units will add a whole new level of challenge. 





Maps currently generate whenever a new match is started. Hit
this goal and we can include a Map editing mode that will allow you to lay out
whole worlds, as well as place units, and adjust game play settings that you
can share with or challenge your friends in. 





One of the Game modes that was benched as it was difficult
to fit into our original scope was this asymmetrically challenge mode. One
player will either play as a super army or super defender, against several
other players. Resist the siege of multiple armies, or lay waste to many keeps.





We would love to get Siege the Day on every platform
possible, but to get the game ready for console will take some serious work.
Hit this goal and we’ll work on letting you lay siege on either your Xbox One
or PS4. 





We’re going to buy a bag of chips… maybe two.




Have a question, or confused about something above. We might
have explained or answer your question here:


“Why are you asking
for so little?”
Two reasons. First, we are still putting our own finances
into Siege the Day. The amount were asking for is what we need to finish
development. Second, we are a small startup studio and this is our debut game,
we want to be realistic and not overreach or over promise. 


“Are you using any
game creation tool?”
Nope. Siege the Day is being created 100% from scratch. Even
the game engine was created by us.


“Can I see more
gameplay?”
Absolutely! We’re premiering the gameplay at RTX 2016 here
is Austin, TX. If you’re going feel free to stop by and we’ll show you
everything. After RTX we’ll be uploading more gameplay footage here. 


“Your game doesn’t
look finished.”
I’d hope not, otherwise there wouldn’t be a reason for this
campaign. If you are referring the video or other media that don’t look like the
typical marketing material, that is because we have focused on mechanics and
gameplay so far, and the graphics are not quite to finished quality yet. 


“Why the cartoon like
style? Is this a kid’s game?”
Aesthetic choice. We wanted to create an easy to approach
look to Siege the Day. Easy to approach doesn’t mean easy to master though. 


“Is this going to be
some mobile game ported to PC?”
Not at all. We would like to release a mobile version, but
this is a full PC title. 


“Are you going to
have micro-transactions?”
It’s common in games lately to have some element that is
micro-transaction based. We don’t want to have anything like that effecting our
game. The only micro-transactions we’ve even considered were for unique banner
symbols, and only so we could pay artists to create more.


“Are the $10,000 and
$20,000 perks real?”
Absolutely. We see all of our backers as investors. If
someone believes in us and what we can accomplish to that degree we would
absolutely love to hear their opinions and give them a voice in our future
developments and projects.


“Are you really going
to just buy chips if you reach $1,000,000?”
Possibly. Mostly we just wanted to show that even at such a
high goal we are keeping the scope of what we want to do. If we reach
$1,000,000 there is plenty of things we’d love to do with Siege the Day, plenty
of ideas we had to shelf we’ll revisit. But we don’t want to start promising more
and more features to the point it is more than we can handle. 


“I like the idea, but
I’m not sure I want to back the campaign…”
Hey, that’s ok. We get it. Though if you like the idea,
maybe consider checking out and supporting the game’s Steam Greenlight page.
It’s free and helps us get the game on Steam. You can find the game here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetai...",73.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Let's be clear: I've already finished this video game. It's free and you can play it right now. I'd like to make a better one though, so if you like the concept of the game but think it could use some work, please consider helping me to do so. You wouldn't be paying me to make a game that I might never finish, you'd be paying an artist to make assets.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money will immediately go towards the artist to make the first map, at which point it will be posted here as an example of what the funding will go towards. If the art doesn't suit the game, we'll rework it. We don't need the full $1000 yet, just enough to pay our hard working artists for some preliminary examples. From there we'll fund the rest of the maps if it works out.</p>
<p>This will make a sequel/remake possible. I have a lot of ideas to improve the game, but they don't belong in the current game. This game has its own flavour, as will the sequel. They will improve gameplay, but they need better visuals to avoid the issues the first game had with public perception.</p>
<p>If you think this game has any potential, contributions will make it possible and viable for me to reach that potential. IF possible, all contributions will go towards a discount or full payment of the final product of the game, as well as beta access. NOTE: This hasn't been set up or verified yet! This is my goal though, as you'd better get your money's worth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily but still think the game has potential, consider sharing this with people. I'd also like to get the current game onto Steam Greenlight, and that needs to get done before Greenlight is taken down.</p>

<p>Gravity Spin is a single player mobile puzzle/platformer with a minimalistic style. The concept is simple: You are a ball in a maze and your goal is to reach the green block. How do you do that? You as a player posses the ability turn the direction of the gravity, but that is not all: on your way you will meet blocks that would restart the level, guns lasers or just moving objects.</p>

<div>All additional funds will go on supporting me as a young developer and securing the future for Gravity Spin.

</div></div>","Gravity Spin

Concept
Gravity Spin is a single player mobile puzzle/platformer with a minimalistic style. The concept is simple: You are a ball in a maze and your goal is to reach the green block. How do you do that? You as a player posses the ability turn the direction of the gravity, but that is not all: on your way you will meet blocks that would restart the level, guns lasers or just moving objects.
Gameplay Video


Levels
The game is estimated to have at least 96 levels in at least two chapters (48 each) at the start, and receive more with updates. There will be three game-modes:


Normal: every level is independent and you can skip the especially difficult ones by watching a 20 second long video.
Series - available only if chapter is complete: you start at the first level in the chapter and you work your way to the top, only one small detail: you make a step back with every failure, so losing at level 30 will send you to level 29.
Hardcore -  available only if chapter is complete: same as Series but this time no second chances. You have to complete an entire chapter from the first try - fail once and be sent to level one.


Vision

I see this game as being free experience not clouded by micro-transactions and advertisement, I plan to stick to the policy of players being abel to complete entire game without watching an add once. I hope to use advertisement only in three places: 

Watch a video to unlock a skin that you received for completing a task.

Watch a video to skip a level that does not allow you to move forward.
Watch a video to support the developer and say ""Thank you"",

I also plan on avoiding any kind of power-ups, I even considered a name ""Pure Skill"" for that reason.

Long Term Plans
What Are my plans on Gravity Spin after the release:


New chapters
New intractables in levels
Steam release
Game Center and Google Play achievements
Facebook leaderboard and achievement sharing
Everyplay integration.

<br/><h3>‣ Hunting &amp; Resource Gathering</h3>There are two holes on the boat for putting fishing rod and trawl. If you craft two fishing rod or trawl, you can use them at the same time. You have to remove them before the storm. Otherwise, you will lose them.</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442240002/hbdogqf0b4rnr90sdzkn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h4>a. Fishing Rod</h4>
Fishing rod can be used for hunting a single fish. Crafting it, is easier than trawl. You can craft longer fishing line. This will increase your chance and you will ""probably"" get bigger fishes. Probability changes according to depth.  Also, fish hunting time will be shorter.</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442167003/nfexj6fhi2uma2f1pz77.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
When you use a fishing rod, you have to check the sea depth (Sea depth is going to be on the screen). Otherwise, if <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">fishing hook hit </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">seabed, your fishing line will break off after a while.

<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You can use trawl to hunt more than one fish and get resources which is on the seabed. You can get fishes, woods, plants, inorganic things, etc... Your trawl must hit the seabed. Otherwise, you will get only fishes. You have to check the depth. Also, your trawl is not big as the representative picture. You have 4 slots.</span></div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It is not going to be easy to craft a trawl. Needed resources can be gotten from the sea surface. Some objects are floating on the water. You need to grab them.</span></div>

<h4>
<br/>c. Floating Objects</h4>
</div>
<div>Grabbing floating objects, is another way to gather resources in the game. As you know, all objects are not floatable.  So, you must craft a trawl to reach others. </div>
<div>Grabbing floating objects, is going to be a minigame. You must chase the object with the cursor for a while and fill the grab bar, to grab it. This minigame will make grabbing more challenging and funnier.  While a valuable object is moving on the water near you, it will be thrilling for you. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442181807/trzzqi7cjodepmpcbdrn.png"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/>
</div>
<br/>
<h3>‣ Cooking</h3>You can cook food  in the game. It is optional. But eating raw meat is not healthy. If you don't cook your food, you may become ill. Also, you have to track cooking. Otherwise, eating burned food is not healthy as well.<br/>
</div>
<div style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">
<br/>

<br/><h3>‣ Drinking Water</h3>
<p></p>
<p>As you know, water is extremely important for life. But, sea water is not drinkable. If you drink it, you will die because of dehydration. Also, it has various microorganisms. You may be ill. </p>
<p>In the game, you are free to drink it. But, if you drink too much sea water, you will die or become ill.</p>
<p>So, you must produce drinking water. Theory of it, is simple. ""Boil the sea water, collect it as a drinking water""<br/><br/><i>Representative picture about producing drinking water</i><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442189268/ukcmard9blpyarnadcxt.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p><br/>You can drink the collected water, safely.<br/></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> This process removes minerals from water. You can get minerals from food, alternatively. Long-run affects on health is scientifically controversial.</p>

<br/><h3>‣ Crafting</h3>
</div>
<div style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">There is an inventory and crafting mechanism in the game. You are going to be able to craft new/better items with crafting system such as longer fishing line, boat cover, blanket, trawl, medicine, bucket, hammer etc... Also, you may find some original thrown items (radio,  lamp,  etc...), while you are trawling and you will be able to use some of them to craft new items.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442238324/uwhqehxmnheuaqjqbc0f.png"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/><br/>

It is up to you. But their effects are different.<br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/><b>Cold: </b></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Temperature changes according to hour and the weather in the game. It will be cold after midnight and if you want to sleep or sitting, you may need a thicker blanket or you can make a fire. Otherwise, you may freeze or become ill.<br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/><b>Energy:</b></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> When you do something (crafting, etc.), you will lose energy in the game.

At the beginning of the game, your character's mental health will be quite sensitive. He will be better with more experience. Creepy sea creature sounds, stormy weather, illness, hunger and other ""negative things"" make it worse.  Sleeping, sitting and eating makes it better.</span>

<h3>‣ Illness</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The main character become ill according to character stats. It is probabilistic and there is no certainty. There are three kinds of illnesses in the game.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<h4>a. Temporary</h4>It is not fatal and you don't need medicine to cure it. It will limit your character's actions (preventing crafting some items, etc.) for temporary.
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<h4>b. Fatal</h4>You must craft a medicine to cure. You will need some sea plants to do this.  Otherwise, you will die.
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<h4>c. Fatal (Instant)</h4>If your character stats are so bad (especially mental health). Your character may die because of heart attack. A scary daydream may impact his life.
<br/><br/><h3>‣ Character Animations</h3>
<p><b>Sleeping: </b>There is a sleeping system in the game. Energy level determines the sleeping time. If you are so tired, you will sleep long. If your energy is full, you can't sleep. Also, you may wake up because of the stormy weather. You must deal with the storm.</p>
<p><b>Sitting: </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Your character can sit to take a rest. Sitting increases your energy, makes mental health better, hunger and thirst increases slower.</span></p>
<p><b>Running/walking: </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is default mode.</span></p>
<p><b>Drowning: </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If your character falls to the sea and he does not have a life vest, he will die. You have to craft a life vest. Crafted life vest will be a weak, disposable item. So, you can use it for one time.<br/></span></p>

<br/><h3>‣ HUD (Head-Up Display) [Pre-Alpha]</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">HUD shows you game clock, temperature, sea depth, home button, inventory, character stats button, D-Pad (for movement) and Joystick (for looking around). It is in pre-alpha stage and user feedback is very important about it.</p>

<br/><h3>‣ Controls
</h3>Controls are very important for games. Bad controller system can ruin it, entirely. It will be designed according to user comments. There are various devices and there may be another need for an alternative controller system.
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">In default, there will be D Pad which is for movement and Joystick which is for looking around. <br/><br/>D Pad is on the bottom left side of the screen (It is like a keyboard)<br/>Joystick is on the bottom right side of the screen. (It is like a mouse)</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Also, there is going to be support for left handed people. D Pad, Joystick positions are interchangeable. </p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<br/><h3>‣ Performance
</h3>
Performance is very important for mobile games. So, low polygon models are used and shaders are optimized for mobile. ~50 drawcalls is recommended for mobile devices. (Very old mobile devices can handle ~20 drawcalls)  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">High end mobile devices can handle ~120 drawcalls, today. Generally, the recommended value is ~50. But most of devices can handle 80+ drawcalls, today.<br/></span><br/><i>During the storm, the game has 27 drawcalls.</i>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442258133/zsgcdqlsymrp9k3agw9v.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Also, there are some meshes and materials which can be combined. This extra optimizations are going to be done at the end.</p>
<br/><h3>‣ Performance and Development
</h3>The game is in pre-alpha stage now and new contents are going to be added. But, performance won't change too much. Because almost all object are already placed into the boat. The game will be expanded, horizontally, not vertically.<br/><br/>I mean, new objects are not going to be loaded in the same scene. New contents will be seen in different times. A new event will start after another event.
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<br/><h3>‣ File Size and Development
</h3>File size is going to be bigger. Because new contents are going to be added. It is hard to say its final file size. But it won't be so big. The game is around 35 mb at the current state.
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""></p>
<br/><h3>‣ Tutorials &amp; Notifications
</h3>Elena is an imaginary sailor in the game. She is going to help you and give you some hints about the game when you need. You are going to be able to disable this feature if you want.

</div></div>","StoryBandits rob and kidnap the main character and after torturing, they put him in unconscious state into a boat. Strong water drags him far away and he opens his eyes in the open sea during the storm. He does not know where he came from and he does not know where to go. He just know that he must survive...PlatformsFeatures
Most of the features can be seen in the video. Please check  it, if you would like to see them. They are optimized for mobile devices.

‣ Day-Night Cycle
There is day-night cycle in the game. The Sun and The Moon move and lighting, shadows are change.
   
‣ Different Weather Types

There are three weather types in the game. Please watch the video to see them better.


1. Stormy
Stormy weather occurs some days, randomly. It comes at night. You have to be prepared for it before. These nights are tough. Otherwise, you may lose your items or your character may die during the storm. Your boat may capsize, if you don't balance it. Balancing the boat is a mini-game in the game.
Rain and waves fill your boat. So, you should craft a cover for preventing them. In this way, you can also save your items. But, you have to play balancing mini-game whilst your character lying down again. Your boat must not capsize. You can use your cover for two times. It wears out and you have to craft it again.

Boat Balance Mini Game
2. Normal
It's sunny, ordinary weather. Sea is not too calm or too rough. Keep gathering resources and crafting items during this weather occurs. The night may be tough.



3. Calm
It may look peaceful. But, it usually occurs before the stormy weather and this may be a signal for you. 


‣ Animals

There are various sea creatures in the game.
1. Dolphin
Dolphins are friendly creatures. They move fast. Their sounds sometimes may be funny or creepy.




2. Whale
They may look friendly. But their huge body may create huge problems as well. Be careful, if they are near you.


3. Shark
Sharks are not going to be dangerous in the first version the game. A minigame about shark attacks is going to be implemented in the second version. 


4. Other

There are going to be 8 different types of fishes in addition to octopus and stingray. Some of them are slightly poisonous. If you eat them, you become ill. They don't kill you, instantly. You must cure yourself, if you eat a poisonous sea creature.


  

‣ Hunting & Resource GatheringThere are two holes on the boat for putting fishing rod and trawl. If you craft two fishing rod or trawl, you can use them at the same time. You have to remove them before the storm. Otherwise, you will lose them.



a. Fishing Rod
Fishing rod can be used for hunting a single fish. Crafting it, is easier than trawl. You can craft longer fishing line. This will increase your chance and you will ""probably"" get bigger fishes. Probability changes according to depth.  Also, fish hunting time will be shorter.


When you use a fishing rod, you have to check the sea depth (Sea depth is going to be on the screen). Otherwise, if fishing hook hit seabed, your fishing line will break off after a while. You have to adjust it.



b. Trawl
Representative picture about trawling

You can use trawl to hunt more than one fish and get resources which is on the seabed. You can get fishes, woods, plants, inorganic things, etc... Your trawl must hit the seabed. Otherwise, you will get only fishes. You have to check the depth. Also, your trawl is not big as the representative picture. You have 4 slots.
It is not going to be easy to craft a trawl. Needed resources can be gotten from the sea surface. Some objects are floating on the water. You need to grab them.



c. Floating Objects

Grabbing floating objects, is another way to gather resources in the game. As you know, all objects are not floatable.  So, you must craft a trawl to reach others. 
Grabbing floating objects, is going to be a minigame. You must chase the object with the cursor for a while and fill the grab bar, to grab it. This minigame will make grabbing more challenging and funnier.  While a valuable object is moving on the water near you, it will be thrilling for you. 


‣ CookingYou can cook food  in the game. It is optional. But eating raw meat is not healthy. If you don't cook your food, you may become ill. Also, you have to track cooking. Otherwise, eating burned food is not healthy as well.




‣ Drinking Water

As you know, water is extremely important for life. But, sea water is not drinkable. If you drink it, you will die because of dehydration. Also, it has various microorganisms. You may be ill. 
In the game, you are free to drink it. But, if you drink too much sea water, you will die or become ill.
So, you must produce drinking water. Theory of it, is simple. ""Boil the sea water, collect it as a drinking water""Representative picture about producing drinking water
You can drink the collected water, safely.
Note: This process removes minerals from water. You can get minerals from food, alternatively. Long-run affects on health is scientifically controversial.


‣ Crafting

There is an inventory and crafting mechanism in the game. You are going to be able to craft new/better items with crafting system such as longer fishing line, boat cover, blanket, trawl, medicine, bucket, hammer etc... Also, you may find some original thrown items (radio,  lamp,  etc...), while you are trawling and you will be able to use some of them to craft new items.

‣ Character Stats

There are various character stats in the game.Health: If your character is ill or drowning, health decreases. Eating and sleeping increases it. Also, sitting slightly makes it better.Hunger: There are various foods in the game and their effects are different. Some of them(big fishes etc.) are filling.Thirst: You can drink sea water (even though it causes dehydration, illness in the game) or you can produce drinking water with boiling method or you can collect rainwater in a bucket. It is up to you. But their effects are different.Cold: Temperature changes according to hour and the weather in the game. It will be cold after midnight and if you want to sleep or sitting, you may need a thicker blanket or you can make a fire. Otherwise, you may freeze or become ill.Energy: When you do something (crafting, etc.), you will lose energy in the game. But, refilling it, won't take too much time. You can get more energy with eating, sitting, sleeping.Seasickness: The main character is not a sailor and he may have seasickness. Weather and boat bobbing affects this stat. You may vomit and lose your health because of this reason. After you get some experience, you will deal with this, easily.Experience: Your experience increases with time and it affects almost all character stats. Seasickness will become rare and your character will resist tiredness, hunger, thirst and cold more. Also, your mental health will be better.Mental Health: Being alone in the middle of the sea, is quite scary. At the beginning of the game, your character's mental health will be quite sensitive. He will be better with more experience. Creepy sea creature sounds, stormy weather, illness, hunger and other ""negative things"" make it worse.  Sleeping, sitting and eating makes it better.



When your character loses his mental health, he will start to hear weird imaginary sounds and see imaginary creatures, happenings. Daydreams, hallucinations may make things worse.   


‣ Illness

The main character become ill according to character stats. It is probabilistic and there is no certainty. There are three kinds of illnesses in the game.

a. TemporaryIt is not fatal and you don't need medicine to cure it. It will limit your character's actions (preventing crafting some items, etc.) for temporary.

b. FatalYou must craft a medicine to cure. You will need some sea plants to do this.  Otherwise, you will die.

c. Fatal (Instant)If your character stats are so bad (especially mental health). Your character may die because of heart attack. A scary daydream may impact his life.

Sleeping: There is a sleeping system in the game. Energy level determines the sleeping time. If you are so tired, you will sleep long. If your energy is full, you can't sleep. Also, you may wake up because of the stormy weather. You must deal with the storm.
Sitting: Your character can sit to take a rest. Sitting increases your energy, makes mental health better, hunger and thirst increases slower.
Running/walking: It is default mode.
Drowning: If your character falls to the sea and he does not have a life vest, he will die. You have to craft a life vest. Crafted life vest will be a weak, disposable item. So, you can use it for one time.

Dying: The main character may die on the boat because of various reasons (hunger, thirst, illness, heart attack, etc.)
Afraid: Fear effects.

‣ HUD (Head-Up Display) [Pre-Alpha]
HUD shows you game clock, temperature, sea depth, home button, inventory, character stats button, D-Pad (for movement) and Joystick (for looking around). It is in pre-alpha stage and user feedback is very important about it.
Note: Image shows D-Pad and Joystick places roughly. Please check the controls section to see detailed information about them.



In default, the game uses 24 Hour Clock, Celcius scale and Metric system. 
Also, 12 Hour Clock,  Fahrenheit scale and Foot unit are supported.



‣ Controls
Controls are very important for games. Bad controller system can ruin it, entirely. It will be designed according to user comments. There are various devices and there may be another need for an alternative controller system.
In default, there will be D Pad which is for movement and Joystick which is for looking around. D Pad is on the bottom left side of the screen (It is like a keyboard)Joystick is on the bottom right side of the screen. (It is like a mouse)
Also, there is going to be support for left handed people. D Pad, Joystick positions are interchangeable. 



‣ Performance

Performance is very important for mobile games. So, low polygon models are used and shaders are optimized for mobile. ~50 drawcalls is recommended for mobile devices. (Very old mobile devices can handle ~20 drawcalls)  High end mobile devices can handle ~120 drawcalls, today. Generally, the recommended value is ~50. But most of devices can handle 80+ drawcalls, today.During the storm, the game has 27 drawcalls.

While looking at the inside of the boat, it becomes 34.
Also, there are some meshes and materials which can be combined. This extra optimizations are going to be done at the end.
‣ Performance and Development
The game is in pre-alpha stage now and new contents are going to be added. But, performance won't change too much. Because almost all object are already placed into the boat. The game will be expanded, horizontally, not vertically.I mean, new objects are not going to be loaded in the same scene. New contents will be seen in different times. A new event will start after another event.

‣ File Size and Development
File size is going to be bigger. Because new contents are going to be added. It is hard to say its final file size. But it won't be so big. The game is around 35 mb at the current state.

‣ Tutorials & Notifications
Elena is an imaginary sailor in the game. She is going to help you and give you some hints about the game when you need. You are going to be able to disable this feature if you want.



‣ Leaderboards & Achievement
The game will use Apple Game Center, Google Play Services and more to store the most survived players. Also, there will be achievements.

    


‣ Social Media
Players will be able to share their achievements on Facebook and Twitter in the first version. If the community request more, new social media sites will be added later. 


   

Risks
The game is tested on iOS and Android devices and there is no problem. But, there are some issues about shaders on Windows Phone. So, Windows Phone version of the game needs extra work and it may be delayed.
Development Tracking
You can track the development daily from this page.https://trello.com/b/yIDQ64PZ/pocket-survival-w...


Release


The first version will be released in December 2015 (in worst case scenario).

<p></p><h4><i>""SO YOU WANT TO GO TO A REAL PARTY?""</i></h4><p>Geekz and Gamez is a new kind of comic and game store:
an <b>event-driven community space</b>.
Where tournaments are held, battle are fought, friends are found, people are
welcomed and revels are made. We cater to all fandoms, geek related hobbies,
and a wide variety of tabletop and card games. </p>
<p>At Geekz and Gamez, you will have the opportunity to
attend and participate in a number of fun events and tournaments, including:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457399710/tsjkhypl11boqh0fk44h.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h1><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">2. RETAIL INNOVATION</span></h1>
<h4><i>""WE WANT TO BE THE VERY BEST, LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS!""</i></h4>
<p>All other comic, card, and hobby stores are basically a
teenage boy’s closet. They have a dark, dingy, smelly, uninviting atmosphere
with stuff crammed to the ceiling. These places are typically so disorganized,
cluttered, and confusing that most casual customers just want to get out as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>When entering Geekz and Gamez, customers will find:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457400007/ubibenhclfejkuc18msn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

SAFE ENVIRONMENT</span></h1>
<h4><i>“NOTHIN’S GONNA HARM YOU, NOT WHILE I’M AROUND”</i></h4>
<p>It is a widely known fact that certain demographics,
specifically women, do not feel welcome in geek and gaming environments. They
are belittled and harassed every time they attend a convention or tournament.</p>
<p>At Geekz and Gamez, we emphasize an inclusive and safe environment
for all members of the geek community. Trolls are not welcome in our store and
at our events. We believe that fandoms and games are for everyone and will
consistently represent that belief every day.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457400933/kfecgdsvtmsnxdhhgszv.png"" src="""" style=""width: 505px;height: 505px;""/></p><br/><p><br/></p>

</h1>
<p>Between the two of them,
Robert and Marty have visited thousands of comic and card shops all over the
world and they have found one consistent problem with each and every one of
them. </p>
<p>Upon first entering a comic,
card, or geek/hobby store, the customer is hit by a smell. It’s as if an alarm
goes off. They are smelling the age of the product in the store, old food
remains, dust, the stench of a rarely cleaned bathroom, body order from all of
the gamers who have come through, and the carpet that has never been cleaned.
As the customer’s eyes adjust, they find themselves squinting in a dimly lit
room the size of Harry’s cupboard under the stairs. There is wall-to-wall,
floor-to-ceiling merchandise crammed into every nook and cranny. Boxes that
have never been opened are piled to the ceiling containing merchandise awaiting
its turn to be displayed. Backorders are piled behind the counter, proof that
many customers never return. It feels as if the whole room is pressing in on
you like a trash compactor on the Death Star. The owner is sitting behind the
counter, watching TV or shooting the breeze with a buddy. The customer is lucky
to get a “What’s up”, let alone an offer of assistance. Like a choose your
adventure novel, the customer may make a hasty exit, wait another 30 minutes to
catch the owner’s attention, or cautiously stroll through the stacks of
teetering merchandise trying to find the one thing they came in for. Regardless
of which path they choose, the customer has never been more grateful for the
sun searing their eyeballs and the faint scent of gasoline on the wind as they
free themselves from their temporary imprisonment.</p>
<p><b>That’s why Robert and Marty
want to start Geekz and Gamez. They have a vision of a welcoming, safe, clean,
friendly environment. </b></p>
<p>Upon entering Geekz and
Gamez, the faint hum of the T.A.R.D.I.S. greets the customer. A fresh and
<b>pleasant aroma</b> fills the air, one devoid of body odor and with clear evidence
that the store and its <b>facilities are immaculately cared for</b>. The customer is pleased
to find that their eyes don’t need to adjust because the store is <b>brightly lit
with natural lighting</b>. The customer takes a moment to take in their
surroundings and finds that they have entered a new world. It is as if they
have stepped into a<b> life-size comic book</b>. The customer is greeted with a
friendly, <i>“Hello! Welcome to Geekz and Gamez! Can I help you?”</i> As the customer
begins to browse the merchandise, they find that everything is neatly displayed
in an engaging, but not overwhelming, way. They hear snippets of conversations
from other customers discussing the latest movie, television show, or
philosophy behind their favorite book. There is a group of students playing a
board game at a table, while another young customer is receiving <b>advice</b> from an
experienced trading card game player on what elements their deck needs for
tournament play. A light on the door of the <b>podcast booth</b> in the back of the
store indicates that there are fun and <b>creative projects</b> happening just inches
away. There may be a cosplay <b>workshop or live performance</b> taking place. The
customer is not only able to find what they came for, but have discovered
several new items of interest and have learned about an upcoming event
pertaining specifically to their fandom. This is a place they can spend an
afternoon, perhaps make some new friends, and get advice on their <b>Cosplay,
LARPing</b>, or game of choice and suggestions for new things to try.</p>
<h1><br/></h1><h1>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">EVENTS! </span>EVENTS!<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> EVENTS!</span>
</h1>
<p>Our events are at the core of everything we do. With
our events, podcasts, webseries, and gaming tournaments, we want to change the
status quo. The retail part of the store is important, but engagement with the
community and challenging established societal norms (within communities
including Hollywood, conventions, gaming tournaments, and cosplay events) is at
the heart of Geekz and Gamez. We celebrate local performance artists,
filmmakers, aspiring professional gamers, live-streamers on Twitch or Youtube
Gaming, Improv Groups, and those who think both inside and outside the box (the
box is bigger on the inside, after all). We will have equipment available for
these aspiring creative types to practice, hone their craft, and market their
own brand of genius. We will have plenty of in-store events. But, that’s not
all. We will be hosting large-scale events and tournaments, sponsoring local
geek related clubs and teams, and organizing Cosplay and LARPing events.</p>
<h1><b><br/></b></h1><h1>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">ALL GEEKS AND GAMERS WELCOME - </span>NO EXCLUSIONS</h1>
<p>There have been a number of events which have happened
within the geek and gaming communities which have left certain demographics,
females in particular, feeling alienated. By and large, the geek and gaming
communities seem to assume they are male-dominated, which simply isn’t the
case. Female voices within these communities are significant and growing louder
and more impactful every day. We cannot change the industry without recognizing
that one simple fact. Women matter, they have a voice, and they are a powerful
force within the industry. It is crucial that we at Geekz and Gamez lead by
example in the way we do business. We cater specifically to women and other
marginalized groups within these industries and will not tolerate any person
who demonstrates a demeaning, offensive, or discriminatory attitude in word or
action within our store, online, and at our events.</p>
<p>When we talk about “Inclusive and Safe”, we mean that
we don’t tolerate discrimination. We want to be sure that at our events, in our
online forums, and in our store, everyone is welcome. There is no elitist
attitude. We expect a certain behavior and tolerance from everyone involved
with Geekz and Gamez from staff to customers. No harassment is tolerated.
Period.</p>
<p><br/></p><h1>CALLING<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> ALL SUPER FANS!</span>
</h1>
<p>A fandom is the community that surrounds a TV show,
movie, book, etc. At Geekz and Gamez we celebrate fandoms and believe that every
fan should have the right and opportunity to discuss and express their passion
for their favorite book, movie, TV show, game, manga, anime, etc. Geekz and
Gamez is a place where people are encouraged to wear their cosplay. Even our
staff is encourage to wear cosplay. There are many events catered to specific
fandoms in the works which have never been done before. Our customers are
encouraged to get involved with our events, hang out in the store and talk
about what they love, display their fan art, and receive our assistance in
building their own community.</p>
<p><br/></p><h1>LOCAL ARTISTS<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> &amp; OTHER TALENT</span>
</h1>
<p>At Geekz and Gamez, we love featuring local artists,
sculptors, craftsman, and performance artists. Artists with unique merchandise
they’ve created will have the opportunity to have that merchandise displayed
and sold in our store. Improv groups are invited to play and perform on our
stage. Beat poets are welcome to come and wax philosophical about Pokémon. If
people have ideas for web series and podcasts, we want to work with them. Think

</div></div>","1. EVENT DRIVEN COMMUNITY SPACE

""SO YOU WANT TO GO TO A REAL PARTY?""Geekz and Gamez is a new kind of comic and game store:
an event-driven community space.
Where tournaments are held, battle are fought, friends are found, people are
welcomed and revels are made. We cater to all fandoms, geek related hobbies,
and a wide variety of tabletop and card games. 
At Geekz and Gamez, you will have the opportunity to
attend and participate in a number of fun events and tournaments, including:
2. RETAIL INNOVATION
""WE WANT TO BE THE VERY BEST, LIKE NO ONE EVER WAS!""
All other comic, card, and hobby stores are basically a
teenage boy’s closet. They have a dark, dingy, smelly, uninviting atmosphere
with stuff crammed to the ceiling. These places are typically so disorganized,
cluttered, and confusing that most casual customers just want to get out as
quickly as possible.
When entering Geekz and Gamez, customers will find:
3. INCLUSIVE AND
SAFE ENVIRONMENT
“NOTHIN’S GONNA HARM YOU, NOT WHILE I’M AROUND”
It is a widely known fact that certain demographics,
specifically women, do not feel welcome in geek and gaming environments. They
are belittled and harassed every time they attend a convention or tournament.
At Geekz and Gamez, we emphasize an inclusive and safe environment
for all members of the geek community. Trolls are not welcome in our store and
at our events. We believe that fandoms and games are for everyone and will
consistently represent that belief every day.
4. FANDOM OBSESSED
""YOU FAIL TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT MATTERS NOT WHAT SOMEONE IS BORN, BUT WHAT THEY GROW TO BE.""At Geekz and Gamez, we go beyond selling merchandise
and hosting Magic tournaments. We care deeply about the geek community and want
to help build up each fandom (in-store and online) by hosting fandom events,
online forums, and meet-ups for fandoms including:


Potterheads:
Harry
Potter Fans


Whovians:
Doctor
Who Fans


Brown
Coats: Firefly Fans


Trekkies:
Star
Trek Fans


Bronies:
My
Little Pony and Friends Fans


Other
fandoms include: Wayward Sons, Trainers, Tributes, Ringers,
Furries, Sherlockians, Twihards, Assassins, Oncers, Whedonites, Boneheads,
Psychos, Gaters, Avengers, X-Philes, Truebies, Hooligans, Scoobies, Gleeks,
Loki’s Army, Phans, and so on…


5. COOL MERCH 
""IT'S SO FLUFFY I'M GONNA DIE!""We carry the latest games, expansions, accessories, pop
culture paraphernalia, and work from local artists and crafters. If we don’t
have what you want, we’ll find it. Here are just a few kinds of product you’ll
find at Geekz and Gamez:
6. SUPER KNOWLEDGABLE EMPLOYEES

Between the two of them,
Robert and Marty have visited thousands of comic and card shops all over the
world and they have found one consistent problem with each and every one of
them. 
Upon first entering a comic,
card, or geek/hobby store, the customer is hit by a smell. It’s as if an alarm
goes off. They are smelling the age of the product in the store, old food
remains, dust, the stench of a rarely cleaned bathroom, body order from all of
the gamers who have come through, and the carpet that has never been cleaned.
As the customer’s eyes adjust, they find themselves squinting in a dimly lit
room the size of Harry’s cupboard under the stairs. There is wall-to-wall,
floor-to-ceiling merchandise crammed into every nook and cranny. Boxes that
have never been opened are piled to the ceiling containing merchandise awaiting
its turn to be displayed. Backorders are piled behind the counter, proof that
many customers never return. It feels as if the whole room is pressing in on
you like a trash compactor on the Death Star. The owner is sitting behind the
counter, watching TV or shooting the breeze with a buddy. The customer is lucky
to get a “What’s up”, let alone an offer of assistance. Like a choose your
adventure novel, the customer may make a hasty exit, wait another 30 minutes to
catch the owner’s attention, or cautiously stroll through the stacks of
teetering merchandise trying to find the one thing they came in for. Regardless
of which path they choose, the customer has never been more grateful for the
sun searing their eyeballs and the faint scent of gasoline on the wind as they
free themselves from their temporary imprisonment.
That’s why Robert and Marty
want to start Geekz and Gamez. They have a vision of a welcoming, safe, clean,
friendly environment. 
Upon entering Geekz and
Gamez, the faint hum of the T.A.R.D.I.S. greets the customer. A fresh and
pleasant aroma fills the air, one devoid of body odor and with clear evidence
that the store and its facilities are immaculately cared for. The customer is pleased
to find that their eyes don’t need to adjust because the store is brightly lit
with natural lighting. The customer takes a moment to take in their
surroundings and finds that they have entered a new world. It is as if they
have stepped into a life-size comic book. The customer is greeted with a
friendly, “Hello! Welcome to Geekz and Gamez! Can I help you?” As the customer
begins to browse the merchandise, they find that everything is neatly displayed
in an engaging, but not overwhelming, way. They hear snippets of conversations
from other customers discussing the latest movie, television show, or
philosophy behind their favorite book. There is a group of students playing a
board game at a table, while another young customer is receiving advice from an
experienced trading card game player on what elements their deck needs for
tournament play. A light on the door of the podcast booth in the back of the
store indicates that there are fun and creative projects happening just inches
away. There may be a cosplay workshop or live performance taking place. The
customer is not only able to find what they came for, but have discovered
several new items of interest and have learned about an upcoming event
pertaining specifically to their fandom. This is a place they can spend an
afternoon, perhaps make some new friends, and get advice on their Cosplay,
LARPing, or game of choice and suggestions for new things to try.

EVENTS! EVENTS! EVENTS!

Our events are at the core of everything we do. With
our events, podcasts, webseries, and gaming tournaments, we want to change the
status quo. The retail part of the store is important, but engagement with the
community and challenging established societal norms (within communities
including Hollywood, conventions, gaming tournaments, and cosplay events) is at
the heart of Geekz and Gamez. We celebrate local performance artists,
filmmakers, aspiring professional gamers, live-streamers on Twitch or Youtube
Gaming, Improv Groups, and those who think both inside and outside the box (the
box is bigger on the inside, after all). We will have equipment available for
these aspiring creative types to practice, hone their craft, and market their
own brand of genius. We will have plenty of in-store events. But, that’s not
all. We will be hosting large-scale events and tournaments, sponsoring local
geek related clubs and teams, and organizing Cosplay and LARPing events.

ALL GEEKS AND GAMERS WELCOME - NO EXCLUSIONS
There have been a number of events which have happened
within the geek and gaming communities which have left certain demographics,
females in particular, feeling alienated. By and large, the geek and gaming
communities seem to assume they are male-dominated, which simply isn’t the
case. Female voices within these communities are significant and growing louder
and more impactful every day. We cannot change the industry without recognizing
that one simple fact. Women matter, they have a voice, and they are a powerful
force within the industry. It is crucial that we at Geekz and Gamez lead by
example in the way we do business. We cater specifically to women and other
marginalized groups within these industries and will not tolerate any person
who demonstrates a demeaning, offensive, or discriminatory attitude in word or
action within our store, online, and at our events.
When we talk about “Inclusive and Safe”, we mean that
we don’t tolerate discrimination. We want to be sure that at our events, in our
online forums, and in our store, everyone is welcome. There is no elitist
attitude. We expect a certain behavior and tolerance from everyone involved
with Geekz and Gamez from staff to customers. No harassment is tolerated.
Period.
CALLING ALL SUPER FANS!

A fandom is the community that surrounds a TV show,
movie, book, etc. At Geekz and Gamez we celebrate fandoms and believe that every
fan should have the right and opportunity to discuss and express their passion
for their favorite book, movie, TV show, game, manga, anime, etc. Geekz and
Gamez is a place where people are encouraged to wear their cosplay. Even our
staff is encourage to wear cosplay. There are many events catered to specific
fandoms in the works which have never been done before. Our customers are
encouraged to get involved with our events, hang out in the store and talk
about what they love, display their fan art, and receive our assistance in
building their own community.
LOCAL ARTISTS & OTHER TALENT

At Geekz and Gamez, we love featuring local artists,
sculptors, craftsman, and performance artists. Artists with unique merchandise
they’ve created will have the opportunity to have that merchandise displayed
and sold in our store. Improv groups are invited to play and perform on our
stage. Beat poets are welcome to come and wax philosophical about Pokémon. If
people have ideas for web series and podcasts, we want to work with them. Think
of Geekz and Gamez as a platforming for representing your fandom, for
displaying your own brand of genius, for being the best geek you can be.

There is a common
understanding that nerds are academically driven, geeks are hobby driven, and
dorks are those who understand the difference. Robert Smith and Marty Sferrazza
are a couple of the biggest dorks you will ever meet.

Robert discovered the joys of
both geeking and gaming at a very young age playing Dungeons and Dragons during
recess while cross-stitching Nintendo characters with his friends. Robert has
been preparing to open this store for years. He has his Bachelors of Science
degree in Business with an emphasis in Management and Marketing. He also has an
Associate’s degree in Event Management and Marketing as well as Web Development
and Graphic Design and is a trained event management specialist. As a former
professional TCG player, tournament judge and tournament organizer , Robert is
very familiar with event and tournament structure and the needs of the players.
Robert has even judged professional cosplay and costuming events as well as
taught hundreds of workshops on gaming, costuming and crafting.


When Marty was little, he
enjoyed dressing himself and his dog in battle gear and going on adventures. He
has a Bachelor’s of Science in Business with an emphasis in Project Management
and Visual Communications. Marty has also participated in and judged
professional trading card game tournaments and has years of sales experience.
He is a jack-of-all-trades but a master of nothing but geeks and games. He
can’t help but share his love of life and this lifestyle.

Erin is a longtime theater
geek and board gamer. When she was young, she and her little sisters would
dress up, put her parent’s musical soundtracks on the record player and put on
elaborate productions. Erin is a professional actor and writer, currently
finishing her Bachelor’s degree at University of California, Irvine in Dramatic
Arts. She also has an Associate’s Degree in Theater. Erin has years of retail
and customer service experience. She works in a more creative support role for
Geekz and Gamez.

<div>
<b></b><p>We want to make playing Arena Online Tournaments a worthwhile event for the player. In order for this to happen, we needed to create several different types of tournaments that range from ...</p>
<p> Completely FREE<br/> Cash Entry<br/> Invitation Only<br/> Ladder Events<b style=""background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">We will have micro tournaments that only last a couple of hours, to major tournaments that will last 6 or more hours. We are also offering a wide range of prizes from Qualifier Points, to gear, to cool digital rewards such as tiered badges, digital trophies, profile skins, Riot Points (for League of Legends) and the king of all prizes, cash!<br/><br/></p>

<div><b>What is a Tournament Credit?</b></div>
<div>Tournament Credits are the form of currency used on the Arena Online Tournament Platform. The value of a Tournament Credit is $1.00 US. They can be purchased to enter tournaments that require Tournament Credits, and redeemed to make a cash withdrawal. However, <u>Tournament Credits purchased through IndieGoGo are not redeemable for cash, and can only be used to enter tournaments. Tournament Credits that are won in tournaments, and future purchases directly through Arena Online are redeemable for cash.</u>
</div>
<div><b>Why are Tournament Credits that are purchased through IndieGoGo not redeemable for cash?</b></div>
<div>The IndieGoGo campaign will allow us to grow and develop a better tournament platform for you. Due to the nature of the campaign, we do not want players to immediately request a withdrawal, and encourage those players to participate in tournaments. Future purchases of Tournament Credits directly through Arena Online will be redeemable for cash.</div>
<div><b>If I am under 18 years old, can I still participate in cash tournaments?</b></div>
<div>Cash tournaments that offer an alternate form of payment, such as Riot Points or college scholarships,  are eligible for entry. Each tournament will have its own set of rules and payout schedule, so be sure to check out the tournament to see if your are eligible! You can also participate in any tournament that does not offer cash prizes, and we will have a lot of those!</div>
<div>
<p><b>I see that it costs $50+ to enter the inaugural tournament, will your platform always be that expensive to play?</b></p>
<p>We wanted to offer something special to kick-off our crowdfunding campaign, so we thought that a giant tournament for a $25,000 payout would be worthy of your donation. In the future, most of the tournaments on our platform will either be free to play or a nominal entry fee of a few dollars. We're in this to build something beneficial for you guys, not to drain your bank accounts dry.</p>
<p><b>How soon can I start competing on your platform? </b></p>
<p>Just about every tier features ""Closed Beta Access"" that will get you into the platform and playing our free tournaments as soon as NOVEMBER 2015. Those that choose to enter our IndieGoGo Inaugural Tournament Series, this will be our first tournament with a major payout that will also qualify the top 4 placing teams (in each bracket) automatically into our Summer Invitational. After this IndieGoGo campaign, we will not open up further Beta Signups until later in the year. </p>

<p></p>The funds
collected from this campaign will be used for:

<p>Production finishing. We make
extensive testings in our prototypes, we have<span> 
some engineering and electrical modifications
which can refine the external shape of the “PPCB Maker”.</span></p>
<p><u>The additional components</u><span>  :</span>  Interior modification, the silk screen frame and
etching tank<span>  of the “PPCB Maker” will require
a modification of the dimensions.</span></p>
<p><u>Technical materials:</u> such as the mesh, the<span>  most appropriate  UV lamps, the electronic starter for the UV
lamps.</span></p>
<p>The “PPCB Maker”
suitcase inside has a complex modification that will ensure the “PPCB Maker” custom
components can be mass produced in the highest possible quality.</p>
<p><u>Raw Materials</u>– The “PPCB Maker” also uses raw materials
like UV inks for curing mask and stencil mask, photosensitive paste, films and
transparency paper, etc.  Since these are high quality components, we will test
them before final the release, and we will purchase larger quantities to keep our
prices low for customers.</p>
<p><u>Final assembly</u> – The last step in production is the large
scale assembly for all custom components, the assembly of all custom components
can be made by the Social Cooperative Enterprise named “Prometheus” .</p>
<p><u>Shipping</u> – “PPCB Maker” <span>fulfillment team from “Prometheus” SCE  can 
organize and handle the mass shipment of thousands of orders worldwide.
For the shipping we cooperate with DHL International.</span></p>
<p>If we don’t reach the
goal, we will complete only the requested claiming perks. And the “PPCB Maker”
will continue to be sold in Prometheus SCE’s e-shop. </p>

<p><span></span>Until now, a lot of people experimented how to make their own PCBs. Now,
this requirement of <span>necessity is met
by the “PPCB Maker”.</span>
</p>
<p>For industry:<span>  a complete
prototype proof, assembly component, bug-free printed circuit board, ready for
mass production. Only the Gerber file is needed .</span></p>
<p>For the PCB designer: “PPCB maker” offers the flexibility to create the
prototype and improve the presentation of their work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>For the PCB hobbyist: is given the opportunity to make a completely own
PCB with professional finish.</p>
<p>For the first time, all the methods and the tools needed to make a
complete PCB Prototype are in one suitcase.</p>

<p>Some
issues concerning the tests before releasing the product.
Such one is the most suitable UV curable ink, the most suitable soldering mask
paste , also we need to extent<span>  testing
of the silkscreen mesh for printing extra light line circuits and soldering pate, We
need to solve the topology of any parts inside “PPCB Maker” suitcase for
ergonomic and more useful use. Multilayer with UV materials and conductive
materials is for extended feature, also printing graphene ink for plastic
sensors</span></p>
<p>According
with milestones we are going to solve the above problems in the first 4 months June
– September 2015.</p>

use, it can expose 1 or 2 side photosensitive copper boards. 

It can expose the silkscreen mesh, it can
expose and dry the UV soldering & UV curable mask. The “PPCB Maker” can receive  full A4 size 210mm x 297mm copper boards,
photosensitive copper boards and silkscreen frames.

The silkscreen can print the most thin electronic
circuits, and it can moreover print the 
soldering mask, and the UV curable mask for finishing protection.


    
The etching tank
uses bubbles and motion when removing the unused copper from the Electronic Circuit Boards. It can use ferrous chloride, or hydrochloric acid with hydrogen
peroxide + water in proportion 3:3:15 .

The whole and complete
process is being shown in a video, photos and operation instructions for the
users are available as a DVD in perks.




3 Ways how to use “PPCB Maker”
1) Exposition of 1 or 2 side photosensitive
copper inside the “PPCB Maker”.
2) Exposition of the silk screen photosensitive
mesh frame .
3) Exposition of the soldering mask and of the
UV curable mask for drying them.
4)Exposition of the conductive UV ink for non copper pcb's.









PPCB Maker the experimental prototype going to be Open Souce Hardware  near end May and in the first days of june we open the prototype experimental PPCB maker in  http://blog.promitheas.net/?p=51,                                                                        and : http://prometheusce.blogspot.gr

The funds
collected from this campaign will be used for:

Production finishing. We make
extensive testings in our prototypes, we have 
some engineering and electrical modifications
which can refine the external shape of the “PPCB Maker”.
The additional components  :  Interior modification, the silk screen frame and
etching tank  of the “PPCB Maker” will require
a modification of the dimensions.
Technical materials: such as the mesh, the  most appropriate  UV lamps, the electronic starter for the UV
lamps.
The “PPCB Maker”
suitcase inside has a complex modification that will ensure the “PPCB Maker” custom
components can be mass produced in the highest possible quality.
Raw Materials– The “PPCB Maker” also uses raw materials
like UV inks for curing mask and stencil mask, photosensitive paste, films and
transparency paper, etc.  Since these are high quality components, we will test
them before final the release, and we will purchase larger quantities to keep our
prices low for customers.
Final assembly – The last step in production is the large
scale assembly for all custom components, the assembly of all custom components
can be made by the Social Cooperative Enterprise named “Prometheus” .
Shipping – “PPCB Maker” fulfillment team from “Prometheus” SCE  can 
organize and handle the mass shipment of thousands of orders worldwide.
For the shipping we cooperate with DHL International.
If we don’t reach the
goal, we will complete only the requested claiming perks. And the “PPCB Maker”
will continue to be sold in Prometheus SCE’s e-shop. 




Until now, a lot of people experimented how to make their own PCBs. Now,
this requirement of necessity is met
by the “PPCB Maker”.

For industry:  a complete
prototype proof, assembly component, bug-free printed circuit board, ready for
mass production. Only the Gerber file is needed .
For the PCB designer: “PPCB maker” offers the flexibility to create the
prototype and improve the presentation of their work as soon as possible.
For the PCB hobbyist: is given the opportunity to make a completely own
PCB with professional finish.
For the first time, all the methods and the tools needed to make a
complete PCB Prototype are in one suitcase.
Technical Information for “PPCB Maker”

When you select a Perk remember to add shipments, they can
announced after the end of the campaign, because we need mass amount for
shipment to reduce shipping costs. DHL International will handle the shipping
and deliveries.------------------------------------------------------------- Prometheus e-shop for the PPCB Maker.
--------------------------------------------------------------




Some
issues concerning the tests before releasing the product.
Such one is the most suitable UV curable ink, the most suitable soldering mask
paste , also we need to extent  testing
of the silkscreen mesh for printing extra light line circuits and soldering pate, We
need to solve the topology of any parts inside “PPCB Maker” suitcase for
ergonomic and more useful use. Multilayer with UV materials and conductive
materials is for extended feature, also printing graphene ink for plastic
sensors
According
with milestones we are going to solve the above problems in the first 4 months June
– September 2015.

<h3>What is G.A.U.S.S.?</h3>
<p>G.A.U.S.S. is the Grand Amiibo Ultimate Smash Series, a collection of amiibo tournaments of a variety of formats grouped for one purpose, to figure out who is the ultimate amiibo trainer! The purpose of this fundraiser is to allow the amiibo community to contribute directly to the GAUSS prize pool and make this a truly epic tournament series.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why contribute?</h3>
<p>By contibuting to this fundraiser, you'll be increasing the prize pool for GAUSS, helping Splice cover the costs of the awesome trophmiibos he's made, and, potentially, helping yourself increase the prize pool for yourself if you are able to make it to the Final GAUSS-down tournament! Oh... and did I mention the awesome perks we have arranged?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li>D-tier: You will be given the GAUSS Donator title on the Splicestream Discord and access to the Mad GAUSS, the channel only for Donators where we can make plans to make GAUSS bigger and badder than ever!</li>
<li>C-tier:  In addition to D-tier perks, you get a GAUSS amiibo stand and flag to show off  your support for GAUSS. Additionally if we hit $1000 we will print more flags for trainers who win tournaments, reach the Final GAUSS-Down tournament, and other milestones to have more things to put into your GAUSS stand.</li>
<li>B-tier: Love that snazzy custom Splice jersey shirt that has his name and the number 11 on it? Well, you can get one two and join Team GAUSS. Each jersey will be customized with your gamer-tag and number of your choice! Check it out, it's pretty cool. Also you'll get the D-tier perks.</li>
<li>B+ tier: Want both the shirt AND the amiibo stand? Simply sign up for the B-tier and be sure to get the C-tier add-on perk to get the stand for half the price of just signing up for C-tier itself! By Grabthar's Hammer, what a savings!</li>
<li>A-tier: Only 10 of these will be given away: The official GAUSS-theme Wii Fit Trainer amiibo! Each amiibo has been custom painted by Splice himself and numbered to indicate the order in which they were purchased. Currently the amiibo you see in pictures is only in stage two of preparation (silver base and green figure) but when it's done the trainer's hair and clothing will be painted in white and silver respectively. Oh, and additionally you'll get the perks of D-tier.</li>
<li>S-tier: Legends speak of the secret S-tier. How do you get it? By grabbing A, B &amp; C-tier all at the same time! That's right! If you bought them all separately it would cost you $128 but by selecting A-tier and getting the B &amp; C-tier addons you can get all three for an even $100! Join S-tier only if you can handle being an extreme baller (and don't worry, unlike Bowser and Incineroar, we won't ban you). Additionally, those who join S-Tier won't just get the GAUSS Wii Fit Trainer amiibo, customized shirt, amiibo stand, GAUSS support flag, and Mad GAUSS access. They will also recieve the Certificate of Authentication that certifies that, yes, this was not only was the amiibo hand-painted and hand-shipped by Splice, but that your amiibo was handled with utmost care and sung sweet lullabies as it was packed. And I'm not even kidding. I plan to put much more work into this Certificate of Authentication than I really should. Angels will weep when they read this thing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Prize pool</h3>
<p><strong>The more money we raise, the bigger the prize pool will get</strong> with 1st place getting more and even more players getting rewarded. However, how much money is available in the pool is all dependent upon what perks people sign up for as different tiers have different costs and blah blah blah. Therefore, <strong>the numbers you see before you are estimates but no matter how little or how much we raise, once we subtract out costs, the entire funding will go to the prize pool. </strong>Below are our estimates of what we think is possible. These are Splice's most conservative estimates to be safe so if the prize pool ends up being significantly higher, that's why.</p>
<ul>
<li>$450- 1st-4th get prizes, $70 total prize pool. 1st gets $35</li>
<li>$575- 1st -6th get prizes. $125 total prize pool. 1st gets $50</li>
<li>$750- 1st-8th get prizes. $205 total prize pool. 1st gets $70</li>
<li>$1000- 1st-12th get prizes. $335 total prize pool. 1st gets $100</li>
<li>$1400- 1st-16th get prizes. $490 total prize pool. 1st gets $100</li>
<li>$1500- 1st-16th get prizes. $525 total prize pool. 1st gets $135</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, these are just CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES. Prize pools are likely to be bigger at each pay level but Splice is trying to underpromise and overdeliver when it comes to the prize pool :)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote GAUSS on social media by making clips of fun or amazing moments</li>
<li>Share GAUSS content on various Discords you run</li>
<li>Send amiibo to Splice's PO Box for future Trophmiibo</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Thanks so much for your time! We'll see you shortly! All perks will be mailed out in November when we know exactly how many people are interested in what items.</p></div>","What is G.A.U.S.S.?

<p><strong>Part of our inspiration for The Kaiju Offensive came from a Godzilla game that we didn’t like. We enjoy playing giant monster games and were discussing them and realized that we hadn't seen any that appealed to us in a long time.

<p><strong>Suspicious Ducks is a very small indie game development team. There are two of us, but we are fully committed to developing our game. We have been working on The Kaiju Offensive for more than a year now. We have a playable pc version of our game with four kaiju. It is not available to the public yet. We would like to add more kaiju, maps and human bosses to the game, however we need financial support in order to continue working on it. We are planning a March 2019 delivery date. This date is based on the project reaching minimum funding goals. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The size of the game and the delivery date will be dependent on the degree to which the project is funded. However, a larger project may result in a later delivery date of the final game. We will do everything in our power to deliver the game on time. We don't have an advertisement budget, so we have taken on the daunting task of advertising. Our friends and family have been a tremendous help in sharing information and playing the demo on social media. </strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Disclaimer:</u>  Please note our backers are very important to us and we want to include them in the design and gameplay of The Kaiju Offensive. We will incorporate their game ideas as much as we deem feasible. However, we reserve the right to reject ideas that we find unsuitable. The final decisions will be at Suspicious Ducks’ discretion.</strong></p>

You fight as a kaiju while humans and their ground defenses attempt to take you down.  
                                                         

 
Test your kaiju’s strengths, learn its weaknesses, and adapt your fighting style to achieve supreme victory. Some of the kaiju will use only the keyboard while others will use a keyboard and mouse combination. When you are a novice player, you may need to restart the game repeatedly until you master your kaiju's moves and tactics. 
 
You descend upon Earth and reap utter destruction in this giant monster arcade style game. Select your kaiju and start obliterating everything in your path. Pay attention to your health and power bars, as some kaiju are unable to heal. 
 


 

 

 

 


Part of our inspiration for The Kaiju Offensive came from a Godzilla game that we didn’t like. We enjoy playing giant monster games and were discussing them and realized that we hadn't seen any that appealed to us in a long time. So, we made it our goal to make a kaiju game everyone could thoroughly enjoy playing.

Suspicious Ducks is a very small indie game development team. There are two of us, but we are fully committed to developing our game. We have been working on The Kaiju Offensive for more than a year now. We have a playable pc version of our game with four kaiju. It is not available to the public yet. We would like to add more kaiju, maps and human bosses to the game, however we need financial support in order to continue working on it. We are planning a March 2019 delivery date. This date is based on the project reaching minimum funding goals. 
The size of the game and the delivery date will be dependent on the degree to which the project is funded. However, a larger project may result in a later delivery date of the final game. We will do everything in our power to deliver the game on time. We don't have an advertisement budget, so we have taken on the daunting task of advertising. Our friends and family have been a tremendous help in sharing information and playing the demo on social media. 
Disclaimer:  Please note our backers are very important to us and we want to include them in the design and gameplay of The Kaiju Offensive. We will incorporate their game ideas as much as we deem feasible. However, we reserve the right to reject ideas that we find unsuitable. The final decisions will be at Suspicious Ducks’ discretion.

If you just can't contribute financially, that doesn't mean you can't help.

<h3>Change The Game!</h3>
<p>Welcome to GameWithMe. We are here to disrupt the gaming world with a new eSports broadcasting experience that is focused on providing the best experience for our streamers and our members. Our focus is not on censoring what our streamers say and what they do. Our mission is to change the game. Join us on this awesome journey. </p>
<h3>Innovation - That's The Name of the Game</h3>
<p>GameWithMe was created to provide the best user experience on the market. This is shown in our focus on eSports and cooperative gaming.</p>
<p><strong>Innovative Design - </strong></p>
<p>When you stream or view on GameWithMe, you won't be inundated with silly animations and sounds which distract you from the gaming experience. You're looking for a more mature gaming experience and we give it to you</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573174195/ddgyv3nzhewlvbsxy5v6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>VS Mode -</strong></p>
<p>We<strong> </strong>love tournament gaming. The biggest part of the tournaments that we don't like is that many of the top gamers can't make it to the tournaments. There are many barriers to participating in physical tournaments. Travel expenses, obtaining a visa, travel time, and lack of previous exposure.

<p>VS Mode allows for 2 gamers to broadcast together at the same time, playing the same game on one screen, regardless of geographic location. We gamify this even more by allowing for the viewers to vote for their favorite gamer  via monetized votes that not only provide a popularity pulse for the streamers, but also feed into a progressive pool that the streamers can choose the percentages that the winner gets, from splitting the pot 50/50 or winner take all.</p>

<p><strong>Tournament Gaming -</strong></p>

Gamers from different continents can participate in these tournaments opening the door to participate in physical tournaments. GameWithMe is also focused on creating collegiate eSports tournaments as well. </p>
<p>In our opinion, skill is the most important aspect of eSports. GameWithMe Tournament Gaming gives skill more importance than where you are located. We will be partnering with corporate sponsors to create tournaments that have large prize pools playing the best games on the market. We feel like the games played in eSports currently are not wide enough, and want all games to have the opportunity to show who is the best.</p>

<h3>It's Dangerous to Go Alone, Take This.</h3>
<p>GameWithMe is a community, and we are looking for early adopters to join us on this adventure. Together we are much stronger than we ever could be alone. The funds that we raise here will be used to further development, improve support, market the site and create new innovations.</p>
<p>Since we are targeting a December 12th launch date, everyone that backs the site via Indiegogo will be able to use their tokens on our live beta site and after the official launch. Our payout structure is to send more money to the streamers and not to the shareholders of the largest companies in the world. </p>
<p>We can't do this alone, we need your help.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Changing The Game, One Streamer At A Time</h3>
<p>Right now, the gaming broadcast market is dominated by a company that doesn't respect their streamers like GameWithMe does. It's apparent in the name of the company. Our founders want to create a real gaming community. This is something that the competition doesn't want to have. They want to have a few top gamers that they turn into stars and take advantage of the efforts of the rest. </p>
<p>The vision of GameWithMe is to give all gamers to be stars, based on their skills and how entertaining they are; not the patch of soil that they live on. There are no borders in the virtual world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Could Go Wrong?</h3>
<p>First of all, we are taking on the biggest company in the world. This company owns the top streaming service on the planet. They have an unlimited budget for marketing and for development, but their lack of innovation on the site proves that they are complacent. This is because there is not a viable option that is created by gamers or streaming experts. Our CEO has over 12 years in the online streaming market and is bringing all of this expertise into GameWithMe to create an experience that the gaming world has been begging for. </p>
<p>We are David taking on Goliath and while we relish the underdog role, we still need your help, and we will never lose sight of our roots. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While we know that not all people can support us financially, that doesn't mean you can't be a part of the journey. Here are a few other ways that you can help us to ensure success:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><strong>Share this project on your social media to increase visibility</strong></u> - Getting the word out to others is just as important as financially backing us. Since we are just getting started, visibility is one of the most important commodities for us at the moment. We appreciate all of the help that we can get. </li>

Not only do we pay our streamers a fair amount, but we actually care about our streamers. This is reflected in the level of our support. We will do everything we can to make our streamers be heard and happy. </li>
<li>
<strong><u>Become a member of GameWithMe</u></strong> - Streamers are only half of the equation. We want members that are looking for the best user experience in eSports and gaming.

<p><strong>LOW-FI </strong>is a massive open-world sandbox style adventure with action elements.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on exploration and character driven stories. Like a holodeck program, the player is free to explore the city, further narratives, or just hang out in the arcades and back alleys spending their hard earned credits.</p>
<p>Moral grey areas can be explored via player choice in most situations through actions or dialogue trees. You can for example chose to take a bribe rather than arrest a criminal, or even frame a third party for personal gain. Who's going to stop you?</p>
<p>You are free to fly around your entire jurisdiction (section 303). Credits are awarded during your shift for both time and for duties (busts, etc.). Credits can be used at black market shops, dark web delivery systems, vending machines etc., for anything from ship upgrades to bribes or just some decorations for your capsule apartment.</p>
<p>We want LOW-FI to feel like a real world. Completely non-linear and open ended with plenty to see and do.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to the next generation of Cyberpunk virtual reality. Patrol the streets and the skies, solving mysteries, fighting crime, or giving in to corruption and your own desires. The choice is yours.Pledge now for immediate access to the development build for SteamVR, Oculus and Windows MR headsets in October and a full retail release copy in 2020.Development build keys will be emailed out to you as soon as possible. As this is a manual process, it may take up to 12 hours to receive your key. Thanks for your patience.LOW-FI is the street name given to those who cannot merge with The Platform, a ubiquitous virtual reality simulation where most of the population now live their lives. You are a low-fi police officer that has recently been transferred to a particularly crime ridden section of city-block 303. The only inhabitants of note in your jurisdiction are other low-fi, and human intelligence (or below) artificial life forms who have remained among the citizens after the AI singularity. Somewhere, there is a crime happening. You're the law around here, what's your idea of fun? There's plenty to keep you occupied. From investigating the death of the man you're replacing as sheriff to the ""white collar"" crimes and petty street stuff. It's up to you what you allow, and who or what you pursue.Officially, almost everything the low-fi do is a crime. Meme-punks hacking ad-boards to show their dissent, crypto-kids hijacking everything with a CPU for monetary gain. Maybe you can get a piece of that... You could use the extra creds.It's rough out there, but there's still fun to be had.You could hit the arcade... maybe the casino... shake somebody down, or just play some games. 

 
""Robo-sexuality"" has been outlawed... even between consenting, sentient beings. Low-fi lovers forced underground. You could look into that...
You ever wonder what it's like on the other side? I mean, what's happening on The Platform? Is it the Utopian dream the media says it is, or some kind of nightmarish brave new dystopia?
Maybe you can to find out... maybe you're happy just getting by out here. You've got the run of the place. I'm sure you'll do what's right...

 



LOW-FI is a massive open-world sandbox style adventure with action elements.
The emphasis is on exploration and character driven stories. Like a holodeck program, the player is free to explore the city, further narratives, or just hang out in the arcades and back alleys spending their hard earned credits.
Moral grey areas can be explored via player choice in most situations through actions or dialogue trees. You can for example chose to take a bribe rather than arrest a criminal, or even frame a third party for personal gain. Who's going to stop you?
You are free to fly around your entire jurisdiction (section 303). Credits are awarded during your shift for both time and for duties (busts, etc.). Credits can be used at black market shops, dark web delivery systems, vending machines etc., for anything from ship upgrades to bribes or just some decorations for your capsule apartment.
We want LOW-FI to feel like a real world. Completely non-linear and open ended with plenty to see and do.




Massive non-linear open world
Hundreds of crimes and stories to solve and explore complete with branching narratives and dialogue
