<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>To keep it short, my name is Caroline and 2 years ago I decided that I'm going to start a brand called Dunni. Dunni was made to celebrate the power and joy of black and brown people. The products are beautiful, ethical head coverings that are made to protect textured hair.  </p>
<p>Dunni was created to empower Black and Asian people by continuing to show us in a way that is bold and reflects how we move. I want the designs to show the things we believe in, the great things we’ve created, our communities and our cultures. The fresh-take on head coverings are about who and how we are.</p>
<p>Dunni is set up as a sustainable social enterprise. The products are made from natural materials by fair-pay businesses and independent tailors across Africa. The aim is for Dunni to be a partner that supports other entrepreneurs in their own businesses, and to give further development opportunities to those who would like it.</p>
<p>I’m calling on anyone who believes in black businesses or that businesses and brands can be ethical, high quality and also service their communities. Will you support me as I put together a tangible and sustainable business? </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>The challenge now is that I’m stepping up from sourcing fabrics to creating Dunni’s own designs. The picture above is one of many initial designs. Dunni is inclusive. It's made for all genders and non-gender conforming people to be a part of.</p>
<p>I want to make this, but don’t have the privilege of the start-up costs to make this happen, or the eyes of investors to put their wallets to back me. What I do have is myself (if you know me) and the people... it’s never failed yet, so I’d love your support in anyway that you can give it. </p>
</div><div><p>I’ve successfully helped to grow many businesses across the UK and this will be the first time that I start my own! Covid-19 means that I’m no longer working and can support Dunni full-time.</p></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Reaching these milestones will allow me to do the following*:</p>
<ul>
<li>£750 will help to set up, print and ship 1 design.</li>
<li>£2,000 will help to cover printing, finishing and set up costs for the first 2 designs.</li>
<li>£5,000 will support 4 designs to be printed and finished by multiple tailors across Africa.</li>
<li>£10,000 will help to set up our own production and fully equip all tailors with updated machinery.</li>
<li>£30,000 will support building our first production house and training for tailors across Africa.</li>
<li>£50,000 will support creating our own fabric printing factory. </li>
</ul>
<p>*I will not create this if it involves low pay, unethical practices and poor working conditions.</p>
<p>Anything after this will be split between other new black businesses for their start up costs or supporting their development as an alternate source to the current UK investment funds.</p>

We know -- $30,000 is a lot of money. But this is the bare minimum we would need to cover our loan repayment, producing rewards, and making an awesome e-store. If we exceed our goal -- even better! We can invest all that extra money into making more people aware of our brand and working on the first collection for when our e-store goes live.",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>We are ILovetheUS.org, and odds are, you are one of us too. </strong></p>
<p>We are ordinary citizens who want to express our love for this country while also tackling some of the very ""un-American"" values that seem to be dividing our nation.  We believe in the American dream that each immigrant to our country comes in search of.  When each one of them succeeds in it, it picks us up as a nation, and lifts us to an ever higher level.  We are true believers that our nation is most secure when we have the greatest diversity of people who love our country.  Help us spread this message around our nation, not just at rallies and protests, but in your daily life.  Become part of something bigger than any one individual.  We aren't about politics, we are about <strong>people.  </strong></p>
<p>Our shirts are printed locally by a division of a non-profit organization, that provides job opportunities and vocational training for those with autism and other developmental disabilities.  When you buy our T-shirts, you are not only helping to promote an inclusive environment for immigrants, but also for disabled individuals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to get the ball rolling.  We have our local printer established, and have worked to develop the most eye catching designs to command attention to our cause.  A small supply of shirts have been produced.  The next phase is getting the word out.  We need to advertise and get the product into the hands of those who will spread our inclusive message.  We are currently using social media and web based advertising to draw a larger customer base.  With proceeds from this campaign, we can scale up our business and expand our reach.  We need capital to invest in inventory.  While our printing costs go towards a good cause, we still need to try to minimize our printing costs through high volume orders.  Sales of our product through this channel can achieve that.  We also have administrative and web costs such as a P.O. Box, domain fees, and website fees that may be covered with proceeds from our campaign.  We are seeking $15,000 dollars in our campaign here because that would put us in a good place to begin expanding and advertising more effectively, but we will not rest until our shirts reach anyone and everyone wanting to advance this cause.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our perks for your contributions include our heartfelt thanks, a bumper sticker, or one or both of our T-shirts designed to grab attention and elicit a conversation.  Each shirt is shipped to you in our patriotic shipping bags!</strong></p>

<h3>Zendrun's Story</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486390788/iihtxahs4qm2sj45xbnq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Zendrun's story began two years ago, when as artist and designer I began exploring the possibility of bringing some of my own long held ideas and fashion inspiration to life. After a period of experimentation my label Zendrun was born. Influenced by my passion for Japanese graphic design, classical costume and film, I created my first collection of scarves in what I hoped would be the beginning of a growing fashion and accessories brand . </p>
<p>Designing for men as well as women, my scarves are an uncompromising celebration of colour and a powerful statement of individuality. Boldly patterned, warm and distinctly edgy, Zendrun scarves are designed to brighten any outfit and enhance the uniqueness of your look. In fact, because of the way they are designed it is unlikely that any two wearers of a Zendrun scarf will look quite the same.  </p>
<p>We are now ready to take Zendrun's colour revolution to the wider world but we need your help to do it. We are asking for a modest amount of money to launch Zendrun properly, and to develop some more amazing ideas we have in store. With your help, we can finally spread the word about the Zendrun label and reach out to a small but growing band of Zendrunistas who love what we are doing and would like one of our creations of in their fashion armoury.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485009077/yi6zayndkmy2qgqxblka.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Help get Zendrun running</h3>
<p>The first year of Zendrun has been intense and busy, with lots of work going into design and branding. The next step was to find a manufacturing partner who could produce our samples to a high standard. Then in summer of 2016 we took the Zendrun show on the road and previewed our collection to fashion fans and buyers from all over the world at PURE, a fashion expo in London. We were bowled over by the reaction, and found there was a real appetite and enthusiasm for what we are doing. </p>
<p>But having got this far, we need a cash injection so we can take Zendrun to the next level and actually begin reaching out to customers. We are trying to raise £20,000 to officially launch Zendrun. The modest but crucial amount of money we are asking for will mean we can begin ordering in the stock we plan to sell through the website and we can afford to pay for the PR and marketing campaign we need to build awareness of the brand. And more excitingly, we can begin developing one or two other killer lines of accessories we have in store.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Having put in a lot of work into the development of Zendrun, we are well aware of the risks and challenges. At times, it feels like a high wire walk in this fiercely competitive industry. But what keeps us going is the enjoyment and belief in what we are doing and the great reaction we have had so far to our range - people love our beautiful, distinct and eye-catching designs. </p>
<p>It remains a challenge to launch a fashion business from scratch and it will continue to be so, even if we manage to raise our target. What we have learnt is that you need to be realistic and resourceful, and more importantly not put all your eggs in one basket. So we can promise you we will not be complacent and that even now there are hundred other doors we are busy knocking on.</p>

We are now ready to take Zendrun's colour revolution to the wider world but we need your help to do it. We are asking for a modest amount of money to launch Zendrun properly, and to develop some more amazing ideas we have in store. With your help, we can finally spread the word about the Zendrun label and reach out to a small but growing band of Zendrunistas who love what we are doing and would like one of our creations of in their fashion armoury.  


Help get Zendrun running
The first year of Zendrun has been intense and busy, with lots of work going into design and branding. The next step was to find a manufacturing partner who could produce our samples to a high standard. Then in summer of 2016 we took the Zendrun show on the road and previewed our collection to fashion fans and buyers from all over the world at PURE, a fashion expo in London. We were bowled over by the reaction, and found there was a real appetite and enthusiasm for what we are doing. 
But having got this far, we need a cash injection so we can take Zendrun to the next level and actually begin reaching out to customers. We are trying to raise £20,000 to officially launch Zendrun. The modest but crucial amount of money we are asking for will mean we can begin ordering in the stock we plan to sell through the website and we can afford to pay for the PR and marketing campaign we need to build awareness of the brand. And more excitingly, we can begin developing one or two other killer lines of accessories we have in store.

 


 


Perks
 

Risks & Challenges
Having put in a lot of work into the development of Zendrun, we are well aware of the risks and challenges. At times, it feels like a high wire walk in this fiercely competitive industry. But what keeps us going is the enjoyment and belief in what we are doing and the great reaction we have had so far to our range - people love our beautiful, distinct and eye-catching designs. 
It remains a challenge to launch a fashion business from scratch and it will continue to be so, even if we manage to raise our target. What we have learnt is that you need to be realistic and resourceful, and more importantly not put all your eggs in one basket. So we can promise you we will not be complacent and that even now there are hundred other doors we are busy knocking on.

<p>Of California’s largest 15 cities Anaheim is the only city that lacks a performing arts center. When Linda Knohl (Anaheim resident and then-President of the Board of Directors for Musical Theater West) discovered this fact she resolved to do something about it. In 2007 she founded the Anaheim Performing Arts Center Foundation, a 501c3 non-profit, and embarked on what would become a decade-long journey to fulfill the mission of bringing a world-class performing arts center to the city.</p>
<p>In 2016, APAC Foundation secured a negotiating agreement with the City of Anaheim to develop nearly 12 acres of land adjacent to Angels Stadium where the City National Grove currently exists.  When completed, the Anaheim Performing Arts Center campus will feature a state-of-the-art 1,800 seat full proscenium theater, 2,000 seat music hall, 600 seat black box theater, art museum and gallery, fine dining options, and much more. </p>

<p><strong>Copper</strong> is a reddish gold, bright shiny metal that's soft and easily malleable. It's the oldest known metal and considered to have healing properties. It patinas to a warm brown but can also take on a green patina with oxidation. Over time, copper jewelry will lose its bright shine and take on a patina of its own. </p>
<p><strong>NuGold</strong> is a form of brass and is very similar to 14k gold in color. Many people believe that by wearing NuGold, your skin will absorb minerals from the brass and provide the wearer with positive health benefits such as; helping with headaches, arthritis, joint pain and zinc deficiency. Over time, your NuGold jewelry will take on a warm, gold-tone color making your cuff look even more unique than before.</p>

</p><p>The Louloutes team x</p><br/></div>","Louloutes needs your backing to allow us to move to the next level creating a high end magazine for Muslim women throughout the UK which inspires, informs and advises to empower you every day of the week.

Louloutes Louloutes is London’s inaugural fashion, beauty and lifestyle magazine providing a creative, tasteful and engaging platform for modest fashion designers, enthusiasts and newcomers alike. We envision Louloutes to be a perpetual celebration and reflection of the multicultural fabric that envelops the world around us. The backstory…

Conceived in 2012 and born in 2015, Louloutes is proudly motivated by modern modes and driven to communicate them to traditional minds in search of contemporary style.

Backed by an eclectic mindset, we draw upon our London setting, Russian background, and Islamic beliefs to amalgamate contemporary fashion coverage with modest styling for multicultural assimilation. 

Ultimately, our aim is to combine a high standard of journalistic content with professional-quality photography to inform, inspire and advise.

Why modest fashion?


We identified a distinct shortage of publications committed to the reporting of Western fashions in a format that is tasteful, respectful, and sympathetic to the requirements of Islamic dress codes. 
In our experience, existing publications aiming to achieve this lose the excitement and pace of contemporary fashion or compromise the definition of modesty.

The nitty gritty. 

Here is exactly what needs funding so you can contribute with confidence and know where your money is being invested. 

Although our ultimate goal is a beefy £27k, we aren’t going to attempt a marathon before we’ve even taken a baby step. This initial £7k pledge will give us the boost we need to gain momentum and get our preliminary concepts off the ground. 

We know, we know, talking money is boring, so we created this lovely, shareable infographic… because everyone loves an infographic, right?
If you’re unable to provide financial support, you can still be part of this exciting opportunity as your social media support is worth just as much! Sharing our page on as many social platforms and with your friends, family, colleagues and acquaintances could make all the difference to our project’s awareness and future.

<b></b></p><p><b>Présentation</b><br/></p><p>Salut ! Je m’appelle Jean-Pierre Bourhis, j’ai 20
ans et j’ai une passion : le canoë slalom ! Licencié au club de Quimper Cornouaille, je représente désormais
la fédération Sénégalaise de canoë . Cette année sera des plus
audacieuses : étudiant en génie mécanique et automatique à l’INSA de
Rennes, je viens également d’être sélectionné aux JO de Rio en canoë
slalom !</p><p>Ce projet olympique, je veux le vivre avec vous. Faites partie du
rêve !</p><p>Prêt ? Voici mon histoire !</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p>Je
commence le kayak à l’âge de 8 ans et me tourne tout de suite vers la
compétition, car gagner, me surpasser, j’adore ça. Je commence à courir
pour le Sénégal, le pays de mes grands-parents, à l’âge de 17 ans.</p><p></p><p><span>Avancer, aller
de l’avant, il le faut pour atteindre l’excellence. Cette image symbolise le combat
au quotidien que je mène pour réussir.</span></p><p><span><b></b></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454866413/w2kvzj3ztmnnlxb7jgfi.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 412.892px; height: 275px;""/></p><p></p><p>Si vous ne
connaissez pas encore mon sport, le voici ! </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIfz3qqsNes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIfz3qqsNes</a></p>
<p>C'est une course contre la montre où les concurrents doivent
suivre un parcours comportant de 18 à 25 portes, de couleur rouge ou verte. On
doit passer entre les portes sans les toucher, dans le sens de la descente pour
les vertes, en remontée pour les rouges. Le temps réalisé est converti en points (1 point = 1 seconde). Il y a deux types de pénalités: une touche donne une pénalité de 2
points, tandis qu'une porte franchie de manière incorrecte entraîne 50 points
de pénalité. Les pénalités sont ajoutées au temps réalisé.</p><p>Les 2 catégories à différencier sont le canoë (à
genou avec une pagaie simple, issu des indiens d'Amérique) et le kayak (assis avec une pagaie double, issu des eskimo).</p>

<p>Le plus grand obstacle pour arriver fin prêt aux Jeux Olympiques de
Rio n’est pas mon niveau, mais le financement de ma préparation jusqu’au jour J.</p><p>Comme le slalom est une discipline naissante dans mon pays, le Sénégal, je ne bénéficie pas encore d'aide de la part de la fédération de canoë kayak, du comité national olympique et sportif sénégalais ou du
ministère des Sports.</p><p>Je suis le premier slalomeur de l’histoire du Sénégal à me qualifier
au Jeux Olympiques ! Ce faisant, je pose la première
pierre du slalom sénégalais. </p><p></p>
<p>En tant qu’étudiant, ma situation personnelle et mes
revenus limités ne me permettent pas d’assumer les frais liés à cette
préparation olympique. Pourtant, de ce double projet, je tire ma force et mon équilibre.</p><p>J’ai pu participé à de nombreux
championnats du monde, coupes du monde et championnats continentaux africains

<p>Hi Guys!</p>
<p>My name is Jean-Pierre
Bourhis, I’m 20 years old and I have a passion: canoe slalom!</p>
<p>I’m racing for
Senegal and this year is a special one: while I’m studying mechanical
engineering, I have been selected <a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><span> </span> for for Rio 2016 Olympic Games!</p>
<p>I don’t want to
embark on this Olympic journey alone. I want to share it with you: be part of
this dream!</p>
<p>Ready? So let’s
go:</p>
<p>I started
paddling when I was 8 and I almost immediatly was keen on competing. On  winning and surpassing myself… I simply love
it!</p>
<p>When I was 17,
I competed for the very first time for Senegal, my grandparents’ country. </p>
<p>Always moving
forward is the path to reach excellence.I work and train hard <span> </span>everyday to achieve this aim!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454866413/w2kvzj3ztmnnlxb7jgfi.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 310.751px; height: 207px;""/><br/></p>
<p>If you don’t
know much about canoe slalom, have a look at this  : <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIfz3qqsNes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIfz3qqsNes</a></p>
<p>Canoe slalom is a race against the clock through a
combination of up and downstream gates on a whitewater course. The number of
gates varies with a minimum of 18 to a 
maximum of 25 gates. The direction the athlete must travel through each
gate is indicated by colour: red for upstream and green for downstream.</p>
<p>There are a minimum of six upstream gates on each
course.</p>
<p>Athletes can incur time penalties with two-seconds
added for a gate touch and 50-seconds for wrong negociation of a gate.</p>
<p>In kayak (created by Eskimos), the paddler is seated
and uses a double-bladed paddle pulling the blade through the water on
alternate sides to propel the boat forward.</p>
<p>In canoe (created by Indians from North America), the
paddle has a single-blade and the athlete is strapped into the boat with their
legs bent at the knees and tucked under their body.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why I’m asking
you to support me on my way to Rio:</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454866701/xgg1afvqtaezjenqijpg.png"" src="""" style=""width: 437.411px; height: 218px;""/>
</p>
<p>Since I got
selected to attend Rio 2016 and ended up 7th at the pre-Games event last fall,
I’ve proved that I am now one of the recognized world-class paddlers and I keep
on training hard to be ready for D-Day. I attended many World Cups, World Championships
and Continental Championships. On and on, I got enough experience to get myself
ranked 7th at the Pre-Olympic Games in November 2015. I’m 20 and I’m the
youngest C1 at this position for Rio 2016.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,
funding my preparation for the Olympics is an other story. </p>
<p>I’m the first
Slalom paddler ever qualified for Olympic Games. Slalom is at its very beginning
in my country, thus supports from Senegal National Federation, Senegal Olympic Committee
or Ministry of Sports are not yet available.</p>
<p>A student-athlete,
I’m very proud to be continuing both studying and training : this dual
project brings me an iron will, sustainable motivation and balance.  Meanwhile,  being a student doesn’t help with finance and
this status doesn’t allow me to fund my sport season. That’s why I decided
to launch a crowdfunding campaign. </p>

ans et j’ai une passion : le canoë slalom ! Licencié au club de Quimper Cornouaille, je représente désormais
la fédération Sénégalaise de canoë . Cette année sera des plus
audacieuses : étudiant en génie mécanique et automatique à l’INSA de
Rennes, je viens également d’être sélectionné aux JO de Rio en canoë
slalom !Ce projet olympique, je veux le vivre avec vous. Faites partie du
rêve !Prêt ? Voici mon histoire !

Je
commence le kayak à l’âge de 8 ans et me tourne tout de suite vers la
compétition, car gagner, me surpasser, j’adore ça. Je commence à courir
pour le Sénégal, le pays de mes grands-parents, à l’âge de 17 ans.Avancer, aller
de l’avant, il le faut pour atteindre l’excellence. Cette image symbolise le combat
au quotidien que je mène pour réussir.Si vous ne
connaissez pas encore mon sport, le voici ! 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIfz3qqsNes
C'est une course contre la montre où les concurrents doivent
suivre un parcours comportant de 18 à 25 portes, de couleur rouge ou verte. On
doit passer entre les portes sans les toucher, dans le sens de la descente pour
les vertes, en remontée pour les rouges. Le temps réalisé est converti en points (1 point = 1 seconde). Il y a deux types de pénalités: une touche donne une pénalité de 2
points, tandis qu'une porte franchie de manière incorrecte entraîne 50 points
de pénalité. Les pénalités sont ajoutées au temps réalisé.Les 2 catégories à différencier sont le canoë (à
genou avec une pagaie simple, issu des indiens d'Amérique) et le kayak (assis avec une pagaie double, issu des eskimo).
Pourquoi me soutenir dans ma préparation Olympique ?


Le plus grand obstacle pour arriver fin prêt aux Jeux Olympiques de
Rio n’est pas mon niveau, mais le financement de ma préparation jusqu’au jour J.Comme le slalom est une discipline naissante dans mon pays, le Sénégal, je ne bénéficie pas encore d'aide de la part de la fédération de canoë kayak, du comité national olympique et sportif sénégalais ou du
ministère des Sports.Je suis le premier slalomeur de l’histoire du Sénégal à me qualifier
au Jeux Olympiques ! Ce faisant, je pose la première
pierre du slalom sénégalais. 
En tant qu’étudiant, ma situation personnelle et mes
revenus limités ne me permettent pas d’assumer les frais liés à cette
préparation olympique. Pourtant, de ce double projet, je tire ma force et mon équilibre.J’ai pu participé à de nombreux
championnats du monde, coupes du monde et championnats continentaux africains
sous les couleurs du Sénégal. Au fil des années, j’ai gagné en expérience pour finalement me classer 7ème
place au Pré Olympiques en novembre 2015, ce qui fait de moi le plus jeune athlète à réaliser cette performance pour Rio 2016 !
Le
budget de ma saison olympique
Cette campagne de financement participatif servira à couvrir les
frais liés à ma préparation sportive jusqu’aux JO de Rio et me permettra aussi
de renouveler mon équipement sportif.
Voici le détail de mon budget :  

Frais de compétition et stage  22 300 €Matériel  6100 €Budget Total  
28 400 €Je souhaite couvrir ce budget grâce à 2 sources de financement :D'une part, à l'aide d'un travail de proximité que je mène auprès du comité national olympique et sportif, du ministère des sports sénégalais et de partenariats privés . D'autre part,  je sollicite pour moitié (14000€) votre aide et votre soutien dans mon (notre) aventure olympique .Mon
programme jusqu’aux JO de Rio

Au regard de votre participation à cette aventure humaine je m'engage à vous faire partager mon quotidien par le biais de newsletters, photos, vidéos ! Je vous emmènerai de Bretagne, en Italie, en passant par les

 Be passionate about the change you want to see in the world. Stay WILD & FREE.HELLO THERE! Bird Trouble's mission is to be an online and mobile retail boutique providing a line of fair-trade bags, accessories, clothing, and skateboards for those with a rad lifestyle by SPRING 2016.

If you don't know me, my name is Alexz Sandoval and I am a Chicago based bag and accessory designer. I've been running my brand, Bird Trouble, since 2009 and have sold nearly 1,000 of my handmade products. All Bird Trouble bags and accessories, from the pattern design, to the prototype, to the final products are created by myself - as well as the business side of the business. 

In 2013, I decided to stop working for other people and turned Bird Trouble into my FULL-TIME JOB. That is the year I also decided to move to Mexico, to travel and connect to my heritage. Having family from Mexico truly inspires my work.

Supporting my campaign is supporting a maker with bigger dreams of stocking Bird Trouble's first currently-being-renovated 1978 Dodge Campervan MOBILE SHOP.
By Spring 2016, the Bird Trouble Mobile Shop should be ready to hit the road. I hope to take it to pop-ups, trade shows, festivals, markets, and nearly anywhere we can share our products and story. I plan to be stationed in Chicago for a few months as well as travel to other great cities across the USA.

<p>After months of research and investigation, our team
has created JUMPY, an innovative and multi-functional smart watch for kids of
age 4+.</p>
<p>""Helping your kids to learn time management

developed a series of Apps, such as smart reminders, fun and interactive games,
pet nursery, coach-guided pedo-games, messaging and smart toy control. We wish
JUMPY to be every child's first watch and able to accompany them for a joyful

year's dedication to the project on researching and collaborating with renowned child
psychologists, educationists, and interactive App developers while monitoring and fine tuning the
production tools and process night and day in the lab and factory, we are proud to announce that JUMPY Generation 1 is now ready to be delivered to your hands.
Currently, Android version JUMPY is available, and iOS version will meet the market in December 2015.

     App works on iPhone and iPad.

<p><strong>We created VOLO to solve the problem of bad pockets in athletic apparel. </strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Qasim, founder and designer of VOLO, a new sustainable handcrafted athleisure brand. My main passions are trail running and rock climbing and I was tired of having pockets that didn't hold what I needed and bounced when I ran or climbed. On top of that I was tired of losing my belongings.  I wanted to create athleisure apparel with full size bounce-free pockets, top quality fabrics, a sleek tailored design, and secured pockets to hold your valuables.</p>
<p>We have created three shorts with our smart pocket tech: Earth Shorts, Flight Shorts, and Terra Shorts (Women specific).  Multi-functional athleisure apparel with pockets that won't move when you do and keep your items secure. </p>

Hi, my name is Qasim, founder and designer of VOLO, a new sustainable handcrafted athleisure brand. My main passions are trail running and rock climbing and I was tired of having pockets that didn't hold what I needed and bounced when I ran or climbed. On top of that I was tired of losing my belongings.  I wanted to create athleisure apparel with full size bounce-free pockets, top quality fabrics, a sleek tailored design, and secured pockets to hold your valuables.
We have created three shorts with our smart pocket tech: Earth Shorts, Flight Shorts, and Terra Shorts (Women specific).  Multi-functional athleisure apparel with pockets that won't move when you do and keep your items secure. 

Sustainably Handcrafted in a Solar Powered Factory. We are rethinking ethical and functional athleisure.Each pair of VOLO Shorts comes with Snap Button Pockets, to secure all of your valuables. Deep Rectangular Pockets that move with you and secure your items.           Multiple pockets design to organize and secure your valuables.  The smartest pockets in town, full of secure snap buttons, pockets within pockets that are secured to the shorts at multiple points so they don't bounce when you do. Instead of having U shaped pockets, we created rectangular pockets. Creating more space in the pocket and less movementSecured at multiple points to not move while running, climbing, hiking etc. Breathable pockets made with ballistic mesh. We have created three shorts with our smart pocket tech: Earth Shorts, Flight Shorts, and Terra Shorts (Women specific).The Earth Shorts come with five pockets, an ultra-lite microstretch fabric and a tailored fit.Reinforced stitched and ultra durable. Designed to last for years.  Extremely comfortable, Quick drying, breathable fabric to do all the moves.Flight Shorts come with secure side zippers and snap pockets to secure your valuables. Featuring our super comfortable, feather lite micro-stretch fabric. Ultra quick drying micro-stretch fabric, making them perfect shorts for swimming and water sports.             Choose your favorite shorts from our Men's designs. The Earth Shorts and The Flight Shorts.The perfect athletic shorts for Women! Supremely soft, 4 way stretch fabric. Full size pockets that hold everything you need (finally!).   4-Way stretch, high wasted, super comfortable and a tailored fit.   The perfect athletic shorts! Comes in four amazing colors.  Deep bounce free pockets for women, with zippers and snap buttons to secure all your valuables. Go on a run without needing a bag!      Peached fabric is a luxurious soft finish. After weaving, the fabric is stretched while it is drying, creating its signature buttery soft feel.Our manufacturer is located in Lahore, Pakistan. I personally worked with our small family owned factory that worked with brands like Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein in the past.  Our manufacturers are striving to curtail their carbon footprint, by promising to go fully solar as a manufacturing facility by 2022.     Fabric's sourced in small batches from small businesses in Lahore. Each pair of Volo Shorts is individually handcrafted, sewn, and tailored. The colors used in the logos are hand mixed by the artisans. I personally traveled to Lahore, Pakistan in 2019 to meet our family manufacturers and make personal relationships with the artisans. I worked with them to perfect all of the details in the manufacturing of our products.       We are striving to be an ethical brand. Rather than using plastic bags to wrap your items, which is the industry standard, we decided to switch  our packaging to recycled biodegradable paper bags. Preventing thousands of plastic bags from ending up in our oceans and landfills.",64.0,0,"1 Campaign

Traditional wallets no longer satisfy our customers’ needs, making cash obsolete ever since the introduction of the card payment system. With the cashless trend set to grow, more people are drawn to the convenience of no longer having to carry cash around. And so, the Damda Wallet came into development as a response to the demand for smarter wallet alternatives.

WHAT IS DAMDA WALLET?
Redefining the standard for your daily accessory, the Damda Wallet strives to meet the growing needs of the on-the-go, style conscious individuals by featuring all-around convenience, state of the art RFID technology and awareness of the modern aesthetic through its inherent design.

 


CONSIDERATION OVER THE SMALLEST DETAILS
Damda Wallet features semi-automatic unparalleled link sliding and hinge door mechanism, which enable quick and easy access to the storage compartment.  F501 Type comes with a semi-automatic door hinge that flips open and it will let you carry up to 7-8 credit cards. G501 Type also comes with a unique semi-automatic sliding door and you can carry up to 5-6 credit cards for your convenience.  We have included a card size leather pouch for your own convenience; it will help you carry small items, such as coins, keys, USB, SD cards or SIM card tray.





SEAMLESSLY DESIGNED TO MOVE WITH YOUR LIFE
 We've designed the Damda Wallet to be slim and compact for your convenience, avoiding unnecessary mess and bulk.  The Damda Wallet measures in  4.6 x 2.7 x 0.5"" and weight less than 2 ounces.

REDEFINE YOUR STYLE
Inspired by the pebble stone to reflect the simplicity of nature, the Damda Wallet emulates refined minimalism for the style-conscious modernist.  The Damda Wallet comes in many attractive colors and styles, it will definitely let you express your attitude and personality.



STATE OF THE ART RFID TECHNOLOGY
The Damda Wallet comes with the state of the art RFID technology, and our RFID Card has two distinctive features in a single body; the Boosting Side will increase the proximity card’s signal strength for easy scanning, but the Blocking Side will prevent identity theft from remotely scanning and stealing your personal information.

Millions wear active-wear on a daily basis to look good and feel good, let's do good at the same time!




At Asuno, each item of clothing is linked to a particular charity, cause and action. Once you make a purchase, our charities will fulfil a specific action.

Join the mindful movement and be an active part of the change which helps those most in need.



Conflict, natural disaster and disease have caused unprecedented humanitarian crisis issues in the developing world, causing millions to be affected by malnutrition. Plump'd and their partners on the ground in these locations will be able to provide treatment to 7 malnourished children with every purchase supporting their cause through RUTF (Ready-to-Use-Therapeutic-Food) that is desperately needed.

844 million people don’t have access to clean water worldwide causing 30,000 deaths every week from drinking water from unsafe sources. Every clothing item supporting Water For Africa is one step closer to a new, safe local water source being installed. (1,730 purchases provide a whole borehole)

There are an estimated 700,000 children in Guatemala alone who don’t have a birth certificate and are therefore not recognised by official statistics, so they are not protected by the state, cannot gain an education, and more often than not end up on the street. For every 13 items purchased supporting the identity cause, Toybox will be able to provide a child with a birth certificate, an identity and a future.
 
Where our amazing partners work:



asuno began life as an idea, to bring positive change to our world.
Using our experience spanning 10+ years in sport and fitness, whilst invoking a well-established link between sport and charitable giving - asuno was born.
Giving the power of world change back to you with every item of clothing we produce, our vision was to not only create a brand, but to start a movement.
 
""Alone one person can make an impact, but when we all come together, we can change the world"" - Founder, Ben
 
Every action our charities provide will have a positive impact on someone's life, and even in some cases, save a life!
Take your first steps in changing the world. Find out about our launch lines below.



We create premium quality active-wear. Made with you in mind, we have selected the highest quality materials to provide you with the ultimate freedom in any activity. Whatever your chosen past-time: hitting the gym, practicing yoga, or hiking in the wild... you can revel in the fact that you have also helped to save a life.

<li>It drapes better than pure silk.</li>
<li>It does not cling in humid weather, unlike pure silk.</li>
<li>It is far more crumple-resistant than pure silk.</li>
<li>It weaves and knits beautifully</li>

<li>As you can see from the pie chart above, over two thirds of the cost of this project is in securing the raw materials, processing them to make yarns and then manufacturing with these yarns.</li>
<li>This budget will allow us to have a promotion budget to market the fabric, garments and accessories that we produce.  For us, this will be a welcome change.</li>
<li>Our unique perks are described below.  We are excited to be able to offer you our products at discount below their retail price!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will scale the project back, but we guarantee supplying and delivering all products ordered. </li>
<li>If we get more than we have asked for, we will be able to offer even better prices on the products of our labours.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><ul>
<li>This project is aimed at producing the most fabulous fibre, that is beautiful, long lasting, better than pure silk, ethically and sustainably produced, and at the end of a product's life, totally biodegradable.</li>
<li>We have chosen ultrafine wool, due to our decades of experience working with this rare fibre, it similar fibre diameter to silk and due to the environmental advantages of wool and silk over other fibres.</li>
<li>Neither wool, nor silk, require arable land which could be used for growing food, like cotton, or create deserts, like cashmere goats.  We think that as the World becomes more aware of the environmental advantages of these two animal proteins (silk and wool), the demand for products that are made from these noble fibres will only increase.</li>
<li>By creating luxury products that are long-lasting and contain no artificial fibres, or other fibres that are damaging to the environment, such as cotton or cashmere, we will be providing an ethical alternative to toxic fast-fashion.  <a href=""https://www.whatsinmywash.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.whatsinmywash.org.uk/</a>
</li>
<li>Our Ringshawls<sup>®</sup> were invented to provide a sustainable substitute to the famous Shatoosh shawls of Kashmir, in an attempt to help protect the endangered Chiru antelope, who are shot in the traditional process of making Shatoosh shawls, which have been banned by CITES as a result.  <a href=""http://www.kashmirshawlatelier.com/the-sad-truth-behind-the-ring-shawl-shahtoosh/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kashmirshawlatelier.com/the-sad-trut...</a>
</li>
<li>We have spent decades putting together a supply-chain that harnesses artisan expertise from all over the globe.  This is why our sweaters and Ringshawls<sup>®</sup> are the best in the World.</li>
<li>As you have seen from the quotes above, we have already made an impact with the prototypes we have made from our Warmsilk<sup>®</sup>, and now it is only a matter of promotion and scaling up production.  This is where we need your help.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><ul>
<li>As I see it, the biggest risk that this project faces is obtaining the funding that we have asked for. This is not within our control.  We have to rely on you.  But regardless of whether we get to our target or not, we guarantee to supply and deliver all products ordered. </li>
<li>Another potential risk is the volatility in the prices of raw wool and silk.  Thankfully, we have direct access to wool growers and have reliable agents who can source the best silk at the best possible prices.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><ul>
<li>If you are unable to help us with funding directly, but believe to what we are trying to do, then I would ask that you get the word out, via your networks and make some noise about our campaign!</li>
<li>Feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools, which can help you to help us without financial outlay!</li>

Who are we?  We are Jemala.Jemala Pty Ltd is an Australian-owned family-company who has been at the forefront of ultrafine wool technology and its' application in luxury garments and accessories for over 20 years.  We produce the finest woollen knitwear in the World, bar none and the most fabulous ultrafine wool Ringshawls®.  Our products are worn by European Royalty, Heads of State and ""A-listers"", amongst others.  We source ethically produced natural fibres and employ the best artisans in the World to process and manufacture our luxury products.  All of our garments and accessories are designed and manufactured to be long-lasting and at the end of their long lifetime, all of our products are fully biodegradable""You have a remarkable product (which goes without saying) but also such committed and caring service alongside it.  I can't express enough how much your support has meant for my label.  Thank you so much!  Look forward to our future working together.""Jacinta Demetriou, Australian-based designer at Jacinta JamesWe are committed and caringMy name is Jeff Gill and I am the CEO of Jemala Pty Ltd.  I used to be a post-doctoral biochemist, working in the UK, Switzerland and the USA and recently, I have come home to Australia, to run our family company.  We have recently developed a fabulous new blend that we call Warmsilk®; a blend of silk and ultrafine wool that looks like silk, but out-performs pure silk in the following ways:
It drapes better than pure silk.
It does not cling in humid weather, unlike pure silk.
It is far more crumple-resistant than pure silk.
It weaves and knits beautifully
We can weave it much wider than most pure silk (2.8 metres vs 1.4 metres).
""I have worked within the textile supply chain for 20 years, seeing fabrics from all walks of life! Warmsilk® is a fabric that demands attention. You want to touch it and to feel its’ cool silky handle, yet when you wear it and feel like it's almost not touching your skin, yet you have a feeling of warmth that can only be described as the warm blanket you have been sleeping in.""Marianne McLean-Atkins, Hong Kong-based designerWarmsilk® is a fabric that demands attentionWe are looking for funding to be able to effectively promote our new Warmsilk® products and our more established pure wool products to take advantage of our expertise in manufacturing the best in the World, our well-placed trademarks and our growing local and international reputation.So if you want to look fabulous and feel fabulous, knowing that you are saving the environment and supporting an Australian-owned family-company, help to crowd-fund us, promote us and wear our World's best products.Here are some more authorised quotes on our products from industry notables:Klaus Steger, CEO of the Südwolle Group:""Hi Jeff,  The sweater arrived! Thank you very much.  It is fantastic and my wife says that the colour is perfect.  It seems to be of highest quality, also in particular the linking, not to speak of the material.  Just beautiful.Nearly too precious to wear!""Alberto Frignani, CEO of Gruppo Tessile Industriale (GTI) SpA:""I have received today your wonderful sweater and I thank you very much.  A particularly pleasant and welcome gift for a fan of absolutely “special” and “unique” fibres like me.  I am very proud to wear one of the rarest and precious item ever produced in the world.""More from Robert Emmett, owner of Emmett London:""The combination of the World's finest wool with silk has brought an incredible new cloth, that is warm when cold, cold when warm, wrinkle free, dry on the skin and all from fibres that have evolved over millions of years.Together as one, simply perfection.""Natalie Begg, Australian-based designer and silk specialist:""I have absolutely loved working with the Jemala fabrics! Thanks for this opportunity and I look forward to including in my AW19 Collection.""Giovanni Germanetti, Managing Director Tollegno1900""Your products are stunning, well manufactured and the hand-feel of your wool is better than cashmere!!"" How your money will be spent:
As you can see from the pie chart above, over two thirds of the cost of this project is in securing the raw materials, processing them to make yarns and then manufacturing with these yarns.
This budget will allow us to have a promotion budget to market the fabric, garments and accessories that we produce.  For us, this will be a welcome change.
Our unique perks are described below.  We are excited to be able to offer you our products at discount below their retail price!
If we don't reach our entire goal, we will scale the project back, but we guarantee supplying and delivering all products ordered. 
If we get more than we have asked for, we will be able to offer even better prices on the products of our labours.
The Impact
This project is aimed at producing the most fabulous fibre, that is beautiful, long lasting, better than pure silk, ethically and sustainably produced, and at the end of a product's life, totally biodegradable.
We have chosen ultrafine wool, due to our decades of experience working with this rare fibre, it similar fibre diameter to silk and due to the environmental advantages of wool and silk over other fibres.
Neither wool, nor silk, require arable land which could be used for growing food, like cotton, or create deserts, like cashmere goats.  We think that as the World becomes more aware of the environmental advantages of these two animal proteins (silk and wool), the demand for products that are made from these noble fibres will only increase.
By creating luxury products that are long-lasting and contain no artificial fibres, or other fibres that are damaging to the environment, such as cotton or cashmere, we will be providing an ethical alternative to toxic fast-fashion.  https://www.whatsinmywash.org.uk/

Our Ringshawls® were invented to provide a sustainable substitute to the famous Shatoosh shawls of Kashmir, in an attempt to help protect the endangered Chiru antelope, who are shot in the traditional process of making Shatoosh shawls, which have been banned by CITES as a result.  http://www.kashmirshawlatelier.com/the-sad-trut...

We have spent decades putting together a supply-chain that harnesses artisan expertise from all over the globe.  This is why our sweaters and Ringshawls® are the best in the World.
As you have seen from the quotes above, we have already made an impact with the prototypes we have made from our Warmsilk®, and now it is only a matter of promotion and scaling up production.  This is where we need your help.
Risks & Challenges
As I see it, the biggest risk that this project faces is obtaining the funding that we have asked for. This is not within our control.  We have to rely on you.  But regardless of whether we get to our target or not, we guarantee to supply and deliver all products ordered. 
Another potential risk is the volatility in the prices of raw wool and silk.  Thankfully, we have direct access to wool growers and have reliable agents who can source the best silk at the best possible prices.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to help us with funding directly, but believe to what we are trying to do, then I would ask that you get the word out, via your networks and make some noise about our campaign!

<h3>345 - Love, Believe, Proud</h3>
<p>What is <strong>345</strong>?  It represents three statements: <strong>I Love You,</strong> <strong>I Believe in You</strong>, <strong>I am Proud of You</strong>.  <strong>Three</strong> words, <strong>four</strong> words, <strong>five</strong> words.  Or, simply <strong>345</strong>. These are words we tell our loved ones daily, and words that we love to hear back from them.  <strong>345</strong> gives you an opportunity to convey these three powerful statements in a simple, visual way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>My 345 Inspiration</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Julio Rodriguez, President of <strong>345</strong>.  I found a way to convey these three sentences - <i>I Love you, I Believe in You, </i>and <i>I am Proud of You</i> in a simple, easy way.   I was inspired by my daughter, Jessica, who had been struggling with addiction for years.  Every day, I made sure to tell her one of these statements to help her stay strong during her battles. When she moved away, I wondered every night if she was ok and hoped she was with someone who could comfort her.   I longed for a way to tell her all three statements at once in a simple, visual way.  <strong>345</strong> is the way to this.  I could give her an item with <strong>345</strong> on it and she would always remember that she was loved, believed, and my pride and joy.  I then thought of my other three daughters.  Each one had their own unique achievements and challenges.  Alena was deciding between two jobs.  Ari had just graduated from high school and nervous about the future.  Nicky was recently married and starting a new life with her husband.  These are moments in life that we all have and can use a message like <strong>345</strong> to keep us going.</p>

<h3>Your 345 Inspiration</h3>
<p>I'm sure that you are thinking of a loved one who just got married, or recently graduated, or played in their first sports competition.  Maybe a friend of yours just had a child, or is starting a new career.  Or, maybe, someone you love is struggling with addiction or depression, like my daughter Jessica.  <strong>345</strong> is a simple, visual way for you to let them always know that you <i>Love </i>them, <i>Believe </i>in them, and are <i>Proud </i>of them.  This is a message for everyone, for any occasion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>345 Jewelry/Clothing Concepts</h3>
<p>I've created a line of unique jewelry and clothing items to convey the <strong>345 </strong>message.  I have the <strong>Abstract 345</strong>, which consists of the numbers interlaced among each other in a cool, sleek way.  There is the <strong>Heart345</strong>, which combines the 3 and a heart followed by 45 for a soft, romantic message.  The <strong>345 Circle</strong> has Love, Believe, and Proud circling the 345 numbers for a versatile message for all.  Last, there is the iconic <strong>345 Hand</strong>, which has the fingers separated apart to portray the 3, 4, 5 numbers.  This <strong>345 Hand</strong> is a two-dimensional version of the hand gesture that we can use at any time to remind someone we are thinking of them.</p>
<p>These unique logos will be available on jewelry and clothing items that you can choose from to give to your loved ones.  All jewelry will be available in an affordable zinc-alloy metal for an entry level gift, stainless steel or gold plated stainless steel for a more fashionable gift.</p>

These are words we tell our loved ones daily, and words that we love to hear back from them.  345 gives you an opportunity to convey these three powerful statements in a simple, visual way.
 

My 345 Inspiration
Hi, I'm Julio Rodriguez, President of 345.  I found a way to convey these three sentences - I Love you, I Believe in You, and I am Proud of You in a simple, easy way.   I was inspired by my daughter, Jessica, who had been struggling with addiction for years.  Every day, I made sure to tell her one of these statements to help her stay strong during her battles. When she moved away, I wondered every night if she was ok and hoped she was with someone who could comfort her.   I longed for a way to tell her all three statements at once in a simple, visual way.  345 is the way to this.  I could give her an item with 345 on it and she would always remember that she was loved, believed, and my pride and joy.  I then thought of my other three daughters.  Each one had their own unique achievements and challenges.  Alena was deciding between two jobs.  Ari had just graduated from high school and nervous about the future.  Nicky was recently married and starting a new life with her husband.  These are moments in life that we all have and can use a message like 345 to keep us going.


 


Your 345 Inspiration
I'm sure that you are thinking of a loved one who just got married, or recently graduated, or played in their first sports competition.  Maybe a friend of yours just had a child, or is starting a new career.  Or, maybe, someone you love is struggling with addiction or depression, like my daughter Jessica.  345 is a simple, visual way for you to let them always know that you Love them, Believe in them, and are Proud of them.  This is a message for everyone, for any occasion.
 
345 Jewelry/Clothing Concepts
I've created a line of unique jewelry and clothing items to convey the 345 message.  I have the Abstract 345, which consists of the numbers interlaced among each other in a cool, sleek way.  There is the Heart345, which combines the 3 and a heart followed by 45 for a soft, romantic message.  The 345 Circle has Love, Believe, and Proud circling the 345 numbers for a versatile message for all.  Last, there is the iconic 345 Hand, which has the fingers separated apart to portray the 3, 4, 5 numbers.  This 345 Hand is a two-dimensional version of the hand gesture that we can use at any time to remind someone we are thinking of them.
These unique logos will be available on jewelry and clothing items that you can choose from to give to your loved ones.  All jewelry will be available in an affordable zinc-alloy metal for an entry level gift, stainless steel or gold plated stainless steel for a more fashionable gift.


How Can I Help Spread 345?
I invite you to join me in spreading this 345 message to everyone.  Your donations or funding will go towards helping me raise the capitol I need to start producing the items that you or your loved ones can wear to keep the 345 message close.


Other Ways You Can Help
Any donation or funding is greatly appreciated.  However, if you simply cannot make a financial contribution at this time, I understand.  We all have our personal struggles and challenges, especially during these uncertain times.  Keep your courage up and don't lose faith.  As you watched my video, you saw that the 345 message is for everyone, regardless of where you are in life.  All I ask is that you remember my 345 hand gesture.  You can still simply, visually convey I Love You, I Believe in You, and I am Proud of You just by using your hand.  Place it over your heart and remember that someone is always thinking of you.   
Please use your social media and Indiegogo share tools to spread my 345 message and get the word out to all your friends.
Thank you.",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>The STORY:</h3>
<p>We initially set out to make the<strong> best heated </strong>athletic jackets for men and women.  Jackets that not only looked and fit good, but that were made from a high-end water resistant material that was lightweight, breathable and stretched. Also high on our wish list were thin, built-in, hidden heated gloves for those cold morning starts.  We wanted the gloves to be easy to tuck away when not in use but to always be there in a pinch if needed.</p>
<p>Then <strong>a</strong> <strong>lightbulb went off in our head!</strong>  It was a very early dark morning during some official product testing when it hit us, (or when we were almost HIT!)... It's dangerous out there!   For safety sake, we decided right then we NEEDED to add <strong>wearable lights</strong> to the jackets.   With our battery already integrated into the jackets we were halfway there.  After months of research and development, samples, testing and more samples, we finally have jackets that are beautiful, functional and dependable.</p>

<p>In an effort to provide an additional level of functionality and peace of mind for our heated clothing customers, we have created the world’s first heated athletic jacket with built-in LED lights for nighttime and early-morning safety. Strips of LED lights can be illuminated by pressing a button on the jacket. Pressing another button on the jacket will activate multiple zones of heated comfort which the user can easily increase or decrease to achieve their optimal level of comfort. Hidden within each sleeve is a heated glove liner that can be pulled on when the chill sets in or tucked away when no longer needed. Each water-resistant jacket comes with rechargeable lithium ion battery.    </p>

<ul>
<li>We have physically developed these garments through multiple sample phases to get to the  the working prototypes you see in the videos.  The next step is mass production.</li>
<li>Buying the unique materials and components must be purchased in bulk to make this project affordable to the end consumer.  Crowdfunding allows us to verify this project is as good as we believe it is and helps us raise the money needed to start the production.</li>
<li>This direct-to-consumer crowdfunding approach allows us to offer backers deep discounts for getting behind this project at an early stage.  We are offering early bird and combo pricing at amazing discounts for a select number of units that will not be available at a later date.</li>
<li>If the project does not make it to production for any reason, 100% of your funds will be returned to you.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We need your help in achieving our goal.  Buying the minimum order quantities on materials and components needed to bring this project to life at an affordable price comes at a significant risk for us.  We have designed custom controllers, software and battery power banks to make this all work seamlessly but we need your help backing the project to meet our funding goals and green light this project.</p>
<p>Bringing this product to life is easier for us than you might think.  Relying on our experience and proven track record in the heated apparel category, we feel this is the next natural progression in wearable technology.   Adding a safety component to our cold solving heated wear creates another wearable solution and helps keep people safer.</p>

<p>Risques et défis</p>
<p>We have worked for months without any rest since we have decided to launch the project, but the idea was in our mind for quite a few years already and we have fine-tuned it ever since. It has not been a week without a new idea, a new challenge, a new improvement in the concept. We have overcome all the obstacles, and it was not always easy. When we have been convinced that it was ready, there was no reason to wait anymore and we made the plunge. What you see now is the result of many meetings, brainstorming sessions, sandwiches, pizzas slices and sodas (some beers too, we confess). And the result is here today and we are very happy, we can now, at last, start a diet and go back to the gym. We have given our best to bring you a perfectly finished product that we are sure will please you for a long time. There are many more products in design already and are very eager to launch them as soon as possible. Expect more new innovative and surprising products and garments in the months to come. Be as impatient as we are, and tell it, it will encourage us to work even harder to get them out quickly. Your participation will help fund these new ideas.</p>

Why pack that much clothes?
Travel light with versatile clothing.
Save time, efforts, money, and reduce pollution. Textile industry is one of the most pollutants releasing industries of the world and we want to fight that.
And we also suppressed the zipper and replaced with a very revolutionary magnet system. 
 
The hood is a shoulder bag 


 
 
ICone is the result of a long research for innovative and original solutions, and a meticulous work on the patterns to create a perfectly reversible and returnable garment. 
 

 

 
 

One product - 20 ways to wear it
 

Wear it as is, zipper in front, it's a jacket.

Zipper in the back, you have a sweatshirt.

Add a collar, you instantly become more elegant.

The Belt Clip 
Very unique patented mechanical magnet system.
The clip closes by itself once you approach the two ends. It's like magic. No more pushing to enter one part into the other. No more pressing to extract a clucked part.
Once closed, it is impossible to snatch.
 

 
 Antiperspiration Armpit 

Another genius idea, the antiperspirant armpit. Your choice of white or black.
 

 
Pockets 
The pockets are on the grey side of the garment to give a sporty look.
We chose not to have pockets on the black side to inspire a more elegant look.

ICone will be produced at strategic points around the world to minimize transportation cost and reduce the CO2 impact on the planet.
 

 
Pollution
Textile industry is the second polluting industry in the world after oil industry. 
Do you know that making a simple cotton T-shirt requires 2700 liter/715 gallons of water, a cotton field may get up to 20 treatments of pesticides in one year, and all that ends in nature and seriously impacts on our health.
The permanent damage on the environment is disastrous.
 
At IC, 
We found the way to reduce the carbon footprint by limiting the number of clothes we need to buy. Any of IC garment replaces several, saving money and the planet.
We pride ourselves to select only factories and manufacturing facilities that respect its workers and pay them decent wages. Close to the distribution centers, and closer to you to save what we can of what’s left of our beautiful planet.
 We have children, and we try to preserve as much as we can for them.

Risques et défis
We have worked for months without any rest since we have decided to launch the project, but the idea was in our mind for quite a few years already and we have fine-tuned it ever since. It has not been a week without a new idea, a new challenge, a new improvement in the concept. We have overcome all the obstacles, and it was not always easy. When we have been convinced that it was ready, there was no reason to wait anymore and we made the plunge. What you see now is the result of many meetings, brainstorming sessions, sandwiches, pizzas slices and sodas (some beers too, we confess). And the result is here today and we are very happy, we can now, at last, start a diet and go back to the gym. We have given our best to bring you a perfectly finished product that we are sure will please you for a long time. There are many more products in design already and are very eager to launch them as soon as possible. Expect more new innovative and surprising products and garments in the months to come. Be as impatient as we are, and tell it, it will encourage us to work even harder to get them out quickly. Your participation will help fund these new ideas.

Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles.
Describe your plan for solving these challenges.

<div>My name is Derek Wells, and I've always been a dreamer. </div>
<div>In college, I worked for a local retailer and created bold, unique designs that were tailored to Texas A&amp;M University. They were designs that played off of college-specific terminology and pop culture; creations made intentionally to spark conversation, and they sold incredibly well. Since then, I've dreamed of starting my own company in order to bring the next generation of unique designs to those who prefer to stand out from the crowd.</div>
<div>My company is Crown Twenty, so named to honor the two little blessings my wife, Kelly and I are privileged parents to - our daughter, Nealee (nicknamed ""Princess"", thus the Crown) and our son, Rhett (born on the 20th day of the month).  My company motto is ""What Lives Inside of You?"", reflecting the belief that we all have something inside of us to be embraced and celebrated, especially when it comes to supporting our favorite universities. I believe my vision for Crown Twenty fits a missing piece of the market. It is my sincere desire to grow Crown Twenty as a company built on the voice of our customers, a commitment to service that exceeds all expectations, and exceptional quality products.</div>
<div>With your help, Crown Twenty will target young alumni and supporters of universities, specifically the 25-40 year-old demographic. We will respond quickly to customer requests. We will become the BEST retailer for college-centric apparel. Quite frankly, with your help, Crown Twenty will challenge the status quo of cookie-cutter ideas and products that have homogenized the market. We will be better!</div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; Why I Need It:</h3> <p>My goal is to raise $25,000 for my company, which will be spent in the following detail :</p>
<p>1. <u>$17,500 - Production costs (70% of operations)</u>. I have print-ready designs created and waiting to be put into production. Having an on-going creative process and working with a local print shop, I eliminate missed opportunities to capitalize on new ideas, seasonality constraints, and being second-to-market from other vendors. It also affords me the confidence that blank material and design specifications are complete and accounted for, ensuring that production avoids any hiccups along the way. </p>
<p>In addition to designs I currently have for sale on my website (crowntwenty.com), the production costs mentioned are detailed as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$9,000 for 12 new designs created for unisex short-sleeved and long-sleeved shirts, and unisex sweatshirts</li>
<li>$3,000 for 4 new designs created for women's apparel.</li>
<li>$2,250 for 4 new designs created for headwear.</li>
<li>$1,750 for 4 new designs created for men's golf/business apparel.</li>
<li> $1,500 for 4 new designs created for youth apparel.</li>
</ul>
<p> 2. <u>$2,500 - Technology/Hardware (10% of operations)</u>. My website will always be the easiest means of driving sales, and the ability to update the site at any given moment and from any given location is one vital piece of excellent customer service. In addition, the ability to capture sales data and complete sales transactions on the spot will only strengthen my ability to grow loyalty among my customers!</p>
<p>3. <u>$2,500 - Legal (10% of operations)</u>. Trademarks, copyrights, intellectual property, and representation are a necessity in today's business climate. Crown Twenty will plan to be well advised to protect our interests as a company. </p>
<p>4. <u>$2,000 - Marketing (8% of operations)</u>. While the concept of marketing hasn't changed much in years, how to apply it has greatly evolved. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest have proven to be tremendous avenues for small businesses to gain customers and impact sales, and for virtually no monetary investment. There are other efficient ways to reach my target audience, and that will be through advertising campaigns in football and basketball gameday programs for the universities I create ideas for. These publications provide the most cost-effective and largest-reach possibilities for exposure. </p>
<p>5. <u>$500 - Website (2% of operations)</u>. Currently hosted through Squarespace servers, this will ensure that crowntwenty.com remains active and ""live"" for at least the next 2 years.</p>
<p>Even if my $25,000 goal is not met, all funds raised will be used on a percentage-of basis.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Crown Twenty's Impact</h3> <p>In doing my research, I really wanted to understand what the market was missing, and how (or even if) I could help satisfy that missing piece. I found that most of my target demographic of 25- to 40-year-old college graduates and supporters are looking for apparel ideas they can wear to support their teams, but they don't want something that screams ""This is where I went to school!"" They want something that is subtle, yet recognizable to fellow alumni; something that shows who they support, but doesn't make them a walking billboard. </p>
<p>I also researched licensing fees and what it would cost to maintain and use copyrighted material. In my experience working with collegiate licensing companies while in college, I found the process to be somewhat frustrating, and here's why:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>A design is created and submitted for approval through the university's licensing department.</li>
<li>You wait - maybe a day or two, maybe a couple of weeks - for the decision to be returned regarding your design idea.</li>
<li>If approved, the design is now granted permission for production; if denied (can be a very frequent occurrence), then it's back to the drawing board and you start over at Step 1. If a denial is the outcome, then added costs of time and labor are factored into the equation of profitability!</li>
<li>Once an idea has been produced, a royalty must be paid, whether on an overall annual projection of revenue (projection, not review!), or on a per-unit-sold percentage (i.e. 8% of every single unit sold).</li>
</ol>
<div>I absolutely respect each university's decision to mandate how and where and why their likenesses are used, but my goal is to create something that does NOT need to submitted through licensing, therefore allowing more creative and artistic freedom! There are an abundance of really fun ways to tie an idea into a school without infringing upon that school's protected property. As I mentioned earlier, I've done it multiple times in multiple years and with tremendous success. </div>
<div>I hope my motto ""What Lives Inside of You?"" resonates with customers by allowing them to be bold, loud, and proud in support of their alma maters. My designs may be different and edgy, but they will always stimulate conversation.</div>
<div>One final impact that I also want to describe is my partnership with Boot Campaign (bootcampaign.com). Boot Campaign is a tremendous organization that gives back to the men, women and families of military service, and 20% of the proceeds from all sales are donated to their non-profit cause. This agreement is good for 2016, and will be revisited in December to hopefully extend it for 2017.</div>

</div></div>","About Me:
My name is Derek Wells, and I've always been a dreamer. 
In college, I worked for a local retailer and created bold, unique designs that were tailored to Texas A&M University. They were designs that played off of college-specific terminology and pop culture; creations made intentionally to spark conversation, and they sold incredibly well. Since then, I've dreamed of starting my own company in order to bring the next generation of unique designs to those who prefer to stand out from the crowd.
My company is Crown Twenty, so named to honor the two little blessings my wife, Kelly and I are privileged parents to - our daughter, Nealee (nicknamed ""Princess"", thus the Crown) and our son, Rhett (born on the 20th day of the month).  My company motto is ""What Lives Inside of You?"", reflecting the belief that we all have something inside of us to be embraced and celebrated, especially when it comes to supporting our favorite universities. I believe my vision for Crown Twenty fits a missing piece of the market. It is my sincere desire to grow Crown Twenty as a company built on the voice of our customers, a commitment to service that exceeds all expectations, and exceptional quality products.
With your help, Crown Twenty will target young alumni and supporters of universities, specifically the 25-40 year-old demographic. We will respond quickly to customer requests. We will become the BEST retailer for college-centric apparel. Quite frankly, with your help, Crown Twenty will challenge the status quo of cookie-cutter ideas and products that have homogenized the market. We will be better!   What I Need & Why I Need It: My goal is to raise $25,000 for my company, which will be spent in the following detail :
1. $17,500 - Production costs (70% of operations). I have print-ready designs created and waiting to be put into production. Having an on-going creative process and working with a local print shop, I eliminate missed opportunities to capitalize on new ideas, seasonality constraints, and being second-to-market from other vendors.

$2,250 for 4 new designs created for headwear.
$1,750 for 4 new designs created for men's golf/business apparel.
 $1,500 for 4 new designs created for youth apparel.

 2. $2,500 - Technology/Hardware (10% of operations). My website will always be the easiest means of driving sales, and the ability to update the site at any given moment and from any given location is one vital piece of excellent customer service. In addition, the ability to capture sales data and complete sales transactions on the spot will only strengthen my ability to grow loyalty among my customers!
3. $2,500 - Legal (10% of operations). Trademarks, copyrights, intellectual property, and representation are a necessity in today's business climate. Crown Twenty will plan to be well advised to protect our interests as a company. 
4. $2,000 - Marketing (8% of operations). While the concept of marketing hasn't changed much in years, how to apply it has greatly evolved. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest have proven to be tremendous avenues for small businesses to gain customers and impact sales, and for virtually no monetary investment.

5. $500 - Website (2% of operations). Currently hosted through Squarespace servers, this will ensure that crowntwenty.com remains active and ""live"" for at least the next 2 years.
Even if my $25,000 goal is not met, all funds raised will be used on a percentage-of basis.

<p>Skateboarding has progressed from casually riding on a skateboard to stunts, tricks and maneuvering the skateboard in many ways such as kicks, flips, jumps, spins.....etc. This new maneuvering and riding of the skateboard has been known to cause excessive and severe damage to many areas of the rider's shoes due to the surface that the rider is on, and the manipulation of the skateboard with the rider's feet. On the top of the skateboard is ""grip tape"" which is essentially sandpaper. This grip tape, when it comes in comes in contact with the skateboarder's shoe during the tricks and maneuvers, adds traction to the shoe in order for the rider to perform the tricks. This grip tape also causes tearing and major wear to several areas of the shoe. The main areas of the shoe that is affected are the outside upper of the shoe, the laces of the shoe, the ball area of the sole as well as the heel and heel area of the sole. In addition, the soles of the rider's shoe is susceptible to wear from the grip tape and the hard surfaces on which the rider is skating on when his is riding and performing these tricks and stunts, for example: concrete, blacktop, hardwood etc. Within a short time, the skateboarder has worn his shoe down so much that he will need to replace the shoe because it is no longer usable or safe to use. In this day and age, a skate shoe can range in cost from $40 to over $100 per pair.</p>

<p>The current products on the market provide some protection of the upper portion of the shoe, but not to the bottom of the shoe. These ""patches"" are affixed to the shoe with adhesive glues or other types of adhesive means. Additional prior art shows a product that protects the front area of the shoe. Another product is a type of glue or rubber cement that is applied to the area of the upper portion of the shoe that dries to form a barrier where the wear is prevalent.</p>

<p>The current products as stated above are semi-permanent fixes that are mostly not removable from the shoe. These products, such as the adhesive patches, cannot be removed once applied and do not last very long. They do not allow the skateboarder to wear it for any other use than to skateboard since the shoe is altered and not very visually appealing. They do not protect all areas of the shoe where damage and wear is prevalent. The glue/rubber cement product also is not removable once applied. This product takes time to dry before the rider can wear the shoes to skateboard. Although it can be placed on most areas where the damage is prevalent, It is very messy and does not provide the best protection. It is a very temporary fix to the problem. These products are not removable nor are they reusable. Other products that may be found in prior art are made to be applied due to the size of the shoe and need to be purchased using the shoe size specifically or a small range of sizes.</p>

This overshoe is made of a flexible material that conforms to the shoe in all areas needed in order to protect specific portions of the shoe while conforming to the shoe's shape. This can be one piece or a combination of pieces to create the overshoe. The overshoe adds additional cushioning and traction to the heel and ball of the shoe. The middle of the overshoe is constructed in a way to allow the overshoe to be stretched to fit and conform to a very broad range of shoe sizes and not just to a few size ranges. The upper and the sole also has added traction in the form of raised areas or other forms of traction to allow the ""grip"" of the shoe to the skateboard for the efficient execution of tricks and stunts.

(and cool to wear too!!) This is a flexible overshoe that will protect all areas where damage occurs when skateboarding.  It is a ""one-size fits all"" shoecover. ( This will be  made to fit men's size 6 to 12 - Youth sizes will be created after the initial launch of the men's size) The dynamic stretch bands at the midfoot allows the cover the stretch to fit numerous sizes. The Houkie is stylish, removable and reusable.   Hopefully will launch in February 2016!!  The actual product will be injection molded rubber and in many different colors and looks. The above photo is just a rendering.   The product will not be bulky (approx 1/16th of an inch thick) and will allow the skater to keep the ""board feel"" that is of utmost importance!  Here is a digital rendered image of what the HOUKIE will look like on a skate shoe...

Skateboarding has progressed from casually riding on a skateboard to stunts, tricks and maneuvering the skateboard in many ways such as kicks, flips, jumps, spins.....etc. This new maneuvering and riding of the skateboard has been known to cause excessive and severe damage to many areas of the rider's shoes due to the surface that the rider is on, and the manipulation of the skateboard with the rider's feet. On the top of the skateboard is ""grip tape"" which is essentially sandpaper. This grip tape, when it comes in comes in contact with the skateboarder's shoe during the tricks and maneuvers, adds traction to the shoe in order for the rider to perform the tricks. This grip tape also causes tearing and major wear to several areas of the shoe. The main areas of the shoe that is affected are the outside upper of the shoe, the laces of the shoe, the ball area of the sole as well as the heel and heel area of the sole. In addition, the soles of the rider's shoe is susceptible to wear from the grip tape and the hard surfaces on which the rider is skating on when his is riding and performing these tricks and stunts, for example: concrete, blacktop, hardwood etc. Within a short time, the skateboarder has worn his shoe down so much that he will need to replace the shoe because it is no longer usable or safe to use. In this day and age, a skate shoe can range in cost from $40 to over $100 per pair.





The current products on the market provide some protection of the upper portion of the shoe, but not to the bottom of the shoe. These ""patches"" are affixed to the shoe with adhesive glues or other types of adhesive means. Additional prior art shows a product that protects the front area of the shoe. Another product is a type of glue or rubber cement that is applied to the area of the upper portion of the shoe that dries to form a barrier where the wear is prevalent.









The current products as stated above are semi-permanent fixes that are mostly not removable from the shoe. These products, such as the adhesive patches, cannot be removed once applied and do not last very long. They do not allow the skateboarder to wear it for any other use than to skateboard since the shoe is altered and not very visually appealing. They do not protect all areas of the shoe where damage and wear is prevalent. The glue/rubber cement product also is not removable once applied. This product takes time to dry before the rider can wear the shoes to skateboard. Although it can be placed on most areas where the damage is prevalent, It is very messy and does not provide the best protection. It is a very temporary fix to the problem. These products are not removable nor are they reusable. Other products that may be found in prior art are made to be applied due to the size of the shoe and need to be purchased using the shoe size specifically or a small range of sizes.




The HOUKIE is a removable and reusable flexible overshoe that is placed over the shoe which will cover all areas of the shoe that are damaged during skateboarding. This overshoe is made of a flexible material that conforms to the shoe in all areas needed in order to protect specific portions of the shoe while conforming to the shoe's shape. This can be one piece or a combination of pieces to create the overshoe. The overshoe adds additional cushioning and traction to the heel and ball of the shoe. The middle of the overshoe is constructed in a way to allow the overshoe to be stretched to fit and conform to a very broad range of shoe sizes and not just to a few size ranges. The upper and the sole also has added traction in the form of raised areas or other forms of traction to allow the ""grip"" of the shoe to the skateboard for the efficient execution of tricks and stunts. The overshoe also covers the laces area on the front of the shoe protecting them from damage where it is prevalent. Once the skateboarder has finished using the product, it can be removed and saved to be reused at a later time. The construction of this overshoe is such that it can be used on any type of shoe therefore making any shoe style a ""skateboarding"" shoe.  There is also areas of the HOUKIE that will allow  for different company logos who wish to sponsor or license the product.


We are hoping to have the Houkie last over 4 months so this will save tons of $$ on shoes. We are researching different materials that will be flexible but durable enough in addition to keeping the ""board feel"" for the skateboarder.Feel free to ask any questions about the Houkie. The money raised will be used for the first run from the manufacturer and additional testing. We hope to have the product to market for sale in February 2016.

Risks and challengesThe risks involved here are minimal. Production will start December 2015 as we have located the factory to produce them. We will test the first samples and get the material choice perfect. Then it off to the shelves of shops and stores everywhere.",9.0,0,"3 Campaigns

I am the founder and CEO of D-RIGINAL-L and to help fund the growth of the company and provide more ethically made and functional clothes to you, we are asking for your help. The fashion industry is dominated by fast fashion companies who are able to produce very cheap fashion items at a very quick pace, with that being said many cotton clothes produced by these companies contain a very large volume of pesticides, which damages not only the environment but also the workers using it.D-RIGINAL-L is not setting out to be another clothing company that sells unsustainable clothes or uses sweatshops to keep cost down just to  maximise profits. We don't concentrating everything on making a profit. Human rights, workers rights, and the environment is at the forefront of what we do. Helps us deliver positive change in the fashion industry.  D-RIGINAL-L deeply believes that the continuous environment damage caused by unethical fashion brands and the exploitation of people has to be abolished. Workers deserve a good working condition and be paid a wage that allows them to live life with dignity. With your support we can fight the negative effects being caused in the fashion industry and we are donating 10% of all profits to Labour Behind the Label. If you value people over profit, please lend us your support.D-RIGINAL-L will be producing clothing on a print - on - demand basis, this means the clothes will be made to order resulting in zero-waste. D-RIGINAL-L uses Earth Positive Clothing. They are renowned as one of the leaders in the global garment industry for sustainable clothing production. For more information about earth positive click here.  You have probably heard this cliché, the reason why so many business fail is due to lack of funding. D-RIGINAL-L is using the indiegogo crowdfunding platform, to test to see if people are keen to back us by supporting with their money. Why £15,000?D-RIGINAL-L aims to be at the forefront of functional wear. We are in contact with various suppliers and development teams around the world to attain ethical and sustainable materials for our products. We want to offer you a solution that most major fashion brands are not offering; sweatshop free, organic, functional clothes at an affordable price. Majority of our cost is attributed to the material and workmanship that goes into our clothing. Without your support, it would be impossible for us to offer the world functional clothes that not only looks after the people who make it but the environment too.

<p>Dropping the price of assisted reproduction from $500-$5000 per treatment to $50 is a radical innovation and the logical question is: how is this possible? Especially considering that assisted reproduction has been around for about 40 years.</p>
<p>The key to the answer is sperm preparation. In order to perform a simple assisted reproduction procedure called Intrauterine Insemination (IUI), sperm must be purified. Until now, only fertility clinics were able to purify sperm using centrifuges in their labs. But we have a viable alternative to the current procedure with our patented Baby Home Kit device:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476188130/csrjsynqswwpybqfqwfi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>The Baby Home Kit device provides a safe and natural sperm preparation method and it enables us to offer assisted reproduction at home for the first time in history. The device has an intricate and sophisticated network of channels and layers through which the sperm must swim up and through. The end result being that purified sperm ends up in the outlet channel from where they can be extracted and used for IUI at home.</p>

<p>The fertility treatment industry has for most of its history focused more on the female side of the equation. Dr. Marion Vollmer, the inventor of the Baby Home Kit, started her research by examining the male side of the equation. With 30% of fertility issues attributable to the male, and 30% more being unknown, it made sense to start with the sperm.<br/><br/>Dr. Vollmer's initial research at the University of Toronto focused on state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies which have only been available for the last several years. Combining her own expertise in biomedical science and sperm swimming behavior with microfluidic design and engineering technology led to the creation of the Baby Home Kit device. Some of her scientific findings are shown below:</p>

„BABY HOME KIT“ SOLL DEN KINDERWUNSCH PER DO-IT-YOURSELF-PRINZIP ERFÜLLEN - GANZ OHNE KLINIK
 

 

   
 
Dropping the price of assisted reproduction from $500-$5000 per treatment to $50 is a radical innovation and the logical question is: how is this possible? Especially considering that assisted reproduction has been around for about 40 years.
The key to the answer is sperm preparation. In order to perform a simple assisted reproduction procedure called Intrauterine Insemination (IUI), sperm must be purified. Until now, only fertility clinics were able to purify sperm using centrifuges in their labs. But we have a viable alternative to the current procedure with our patented Baby Home Kit device:

The Baby Home Kit device provides a safe and natural sperm preparation method and it enables us to offer assisted reproduction at home for the first time in history. The device has an intricate and sophisticated network of channels and layers through which the sperm must swim up and through. The end result being that purified sperm ends up in the outlet channel from where they can be extracted and used for IUI at home.
 


 

 
The fertility treatment industry has for most of its history focused more on the female side of the equation. Dr. Marion Vollmer, the inventor of the Baby Home Kit, started her research by examining the male side of the equation. With 30% of fertility issues attributable to the male, and 30% more being unknown, it made sense to start with the sperm.Dr. Vollmer's initial research at the University of Toronto focused on state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies which have only been available for the last several years. Combining her own expertise in biomedical science and sperm swimming behavior with microfluidic design and engineering technology led to the creation of the Baby Home Kit device. Some of her scientific findings are shown below:

<p>Hi, I'm Lance McBrayer. </p>
<p>I've been a certified cosmetologist and salon owner for the last 22 years. I specialize in thick, curly and frizzy hair, and have been voted Boston’s A List Winner as Best Hair Straightener for the past 3 years in a row.  I've also been a fashion photographer for the same amount of time that I've been a hairstylist. And, I've always had a passion for fashion. I've spent 15 years, part-time, as an image consultant to countless business men, fashion show coordinators, fashion photographers, family members and friends.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about self-improvement, health, beauty and fashion, and all their possibilities.  Over the years, I've provided hair styling and fashion styling services that help improve, inform and initiate a desire for individuals to up-grade their own personal style and self-worth. My motto is that if you ""change your hair and/or your look – you change your life"".</p>
<p>Everything I do is with style – whether styling woman’s hair or styling gentlemen in the clothes that they wear.  It's why I started and take the lead in curating The Styled Man Box. It’s a company I started in July 2015 that sends out monthly boxes to male subscribers.  The boxes are filled with 4-6 men’s fashion accessories such as ties, pocket squares, lapel pins, socks, and more. In fact, many of the lapel pins and men's bracelets are designed and created by me.</p>
<p>Check out an example of what might be in The Styled Man Box here:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYJ-B1_1POA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>I've also written a couple of e-books. One, in particular, that gives men seven ways to instantly improve their fashion style.</p>
<p>So, expanding the reach of The Styled Man Box is so important to me because I know that there are so many men out there that are frustrated, unsure and even nervous about putting accessories together that go along with their suits or outfits. They can simply take the accessories out of their monthly box and combine it with their black, blue or grey suit and be absolutely and completely ready to challenge the world while looking great.</p>
<p>I'm looking to raise $6,000. Your contributions will help to procure a PR Specialist, purchase better boxes and supplies, as well as more marketing and advertising so that we can help out more men across the U.S. and around the world up-grade their personal style.</p>
<p>Check out how we package and mail our boxes here:</p>

die USA. Und dort in die Verkaufs-Kollektion namhafter Design- und 
Museumshops, wie z.B. Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, San Francisco

 Jahre nach dem ersten Prototyp hat Alexander Burhans, Uhrendesigner aus Freibug beschlossen, die Uhr von Grund 
auf neu zu überarbeiten und nach einem kompletten Redesign, neu zu 
produzieren. 


Re-Design 2016 - Prototyp


Das neue Herrenmodell ist jetzt deutlich größer, das Gehäuse noch 
feiner und die Zifferblattfarbe heller und freundlicher. Und als ganz 
besonderen Farbtupfer, trägt die Jubiläumsuhr einen roten Datumspunkt.  


-

Ladies first..
Und diesmal gibt es gleich zu Beginn auch eine kleinere Version für die Damen. 






Damen- und Herrenmodell


Beide Versionen erscheinen als limited Edition - und jede einzelne Uhr trägt dann ihre eigene, persönliche Seriennummer. 
 
0001 / 1992 …………….. 1992 / 1992
Weitweit gibt es dann jeweils nur 1992 Exemplare !

Die Idee
Die
 Datumsanzeige bei Armbanduhren ist ja oft sehr klein und für viele 
nicht immer gut ablesbar. Aber, durch die Idee das Datum als laufenden 
Punkt anzuzeigen und damit die gesamte Lauffläche des Uhrwerks 
auszunutzen, wurde diese Anzeige - quasi - zum Gesicht der Uhr. 






Datum als Punkt


- 

Die Geschichte
Das Modell L 
01 entwickelte sich sehr schnell zu einem Besteller und fand in Europa, 
vor allem in Deutschland, der Schweiz, Belgien, Holland und Norwegen 
viele Freunde, ebenso in Japan. Als Modell Orbit fand diese Uhr mit der 
außergewöhnlichen Datumsanzeige, Ende der 90er Jahre, auch den Weg in 
die USA. Und dort in die Verkaufs-Kollektion namhafter Design- und 
Museumshops, wie z.B. Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, San Francisco 
Museum of Modern Art und dem MoMA (Museum of Modern Art ) in New York.
Aber gemessen an den heutigen Uhren, war das damalige Modell  eine relativ kleine Herren-Armbanduhr (nur ø 36 mm).

Risiken und Herausforderungen
We got many years of experience in watchmaking and will do our best 
to deliver the watches on time and in the promised quality. We work with
 serveral suppliers for cases, hands, movements, dials, straps, etc. and
 of course that can cause delays. But we're sure the watches will be 
already finished latest in January 2017.
We want to keep the the production very transparently and will give our backers regular updates about progress in manufacturing.

Wir verfügen über langjährige Erfahrung in der Uhrenherstellung und 
werden unser Bestes dafür tun, um die Uhren in der versprochenen 
Qualität pünktlich fertigzustellen. Da wir mit verschiedenen Zulieferern
 für Gehäuse, Zeiger, Werke, Zifferblätter, Armbänder, etc. arbeiten, 
kann es natürlich immer mal zu zeitlichen Verzögerungen kommen. Trotzdem
 sind wir uns sicher, dass alle Uhren spätestens im Januar 2017 
lieferbereit sind.
Um die Produktion und die Abläufe möglichst transparent zu halten, 
werden wir unsere Unterstützer regelmäßig über den Stand der Produktion 
informieren.",18.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>The Amazon jungle is one of the most beautiful places of the world, that has important biodiversity in flora and fauna of the world, there live hardworking, cheerful and simple people. But the main problem is THE DEFORESTATION. Per year 150 000 hectares of forests are deforested by ilegal logging, ilegal mining and narcotrafic , creating enviromental, unbalancing and explotation problems.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484521245/ieafw9k6y1v4xit29ns9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But against this problem, we have seen a great solution that permit us the development of one product with amazonian insumes withouth damage the trees and supporting the amazonian families through: THE NATURAL LATEX OF SHIRINGA</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484521295/hov3nywvo0xhsuck2eol.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Is here where the Evea project was born.</p>
<p>Evea Ecofashion is a Peruvian social company that work with amazonian communities that recolect the natural latex from the shiringa trees, developing ecologic shoes that respect the enviroment and contribute to amazonian families development.</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>The shiringa is a tree that grow up in the amazonian jungle and it has a milky liquid call latex. This latex is extracted by the communities through incisions on the cortex, only is extracted the liquid needed without damage the tree, then it is stored in containers and through a craft process is converted in latex sheets. This sheets are converted in soles.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484692512/s1dbltfturz5ebux5btr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The most important is that to produce an Evea shoe it has not felled any tree, it hasn´t been damaged any animal, and the enviroment hasn´t been polluted, also it favors the communities economic growth because we work with them in all the process. The challenge of Evea Ecofashion it was convert this craft product in a resistant product and availible to fashion market. For wich we developed an investigation and formula to obtain a high quality shoe and achieve a design that accomplish the required characteristics of the fashion industry.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem of the deforestation</strong></p>
<p>The problem of deforestation arises from  a need of the inhabitants of the jungle to subsist within the inmense natural environment, for that reason in Evea Ecofashion we have understood that we can empower communities trough method that permit the to live in the forest withouth damage it, so we will protect the forest against indiscriminate logging. This will increase the communities families economic income and encourage them to protect the forests, thus achieving a model that can be replicated in other amazonian regions.  </p>

By one side the develope of products derivated by the natural latex from amazon zones it generate an income source very positive to the families, that model contribute to incentive to take care the forest generating an income to them between 65% and 90%</p></div>","The Amazon jungle is one of the most beautiful places of the world, that has important biodiversity in flora and fauna of the world, there live hardworking, cheerful and simple people. But the main problem is THE DEFORESTATION. Per year 150 000 hectares of forests are deforested by ilegal logging, ilegal mining and narcotrafic , creating enviromental, unbalancing and explotation problems.

But against this problem, we have seen a great solution that permit us the development of one product with amazonian insumes withouth damage the trees and supporting the amazonian families through: THE NATURAL LATEX OF SHIRINGA

Is here where the Evea project was born.
Evea Ecofashion is a Peruvian social company that work with amazonian communities that recolect the natural latex from the shiringa trees, developing ecologic shoes that respect the enviroment and contribute to amazonian families development.
How does it work?
The shiringa is a tree that grow up in the amazonian jungle and it has a milky liquid call latex. This latex is extracted by the communities through incisions on the cortex, only is extracted the liquid needed without damage the tree, then it is stored in containers and through a craft process is converted in latex sheets. This sheets are converted in soles.
The most important is that to produce an Evea shoe it has not felled any tree, it hasn´t been damaged any animal, and the enviroment hasn´t been polluted, also it favors the communities economic growth because we work with them in all the process. The challenge of Evea Ecofashion it was convert this craft product in a resistant product and availible to fashion market. For wich we developed an investigation and formula to obtain a high quality shoe and achieve a design that accomplish the required characteristics of the fashion industry.
The Problem of the deforestation
The problem of deforestation arises from  a need of the inhabitants of the jungle to subsist within the inmense natural environment, for that reason in Evea Ecofashion we have understood that we can empower communities trough method that permit the to live in the forest withouth damage it, so we will protect the forest against indiscriminate logging. This will increase the communities families economic income and encourage them to protect the forests, thus achieving a model that can be replicated in other amazonian regions.  




The Evea Ecofashion Campaign
The campaign need $15 000 dollars to adquire:

Natural Rubber processed from the Communties
Logistic Costs (Including the transport cost between the jungle and the zone production)
Steel matrices for new solids sizes
Shoes Production

This will be the first model of Evea Shoes . If you support this campaign , you can win an elegant casual shoes that protect the Amazon. Go on!!!!
 

 
The Impact

31 Families of the jungle will improve their economy
3728 rubber trees will preserved.
Each family have 50 - 200 hectares of forest (average): The possibility to create more value in the forest without cut the trees will have the potential to conserve this jungle area.
Thousands of species conservated, plants, insects, animals and others (We are researching the number of species in that zone - average)

  
 

Risks and challenges We have some challenges on the road. Every region in the amazon, has different kind of natural latex, for that reason we need to research and cevelop new formulas to each zone to standardize the final product.
Currently  we are working in workshops to create different formulas for each amazonian region.  
We are working in Pasco and Madre de Dios regions, we have planned to increase the Evea workshops in other amazonian Peruvian regions .Team Evea Other forms of support  
You can share our campaign with your friends and contacts.

<p><b>Camping</b></p>
<p>The Le Mans circuit is vast and our experience has led us to basing our event at the Tertre Rouge part of the circuit. Rather than separate parking and camping away from your car, our site allows you to camp next to your car so you are near to all of the items you need to ensure you have a good time.</p>
<p>Tertre Rouge in our
opinion is the best location as you have easy access on foot to a lot of the
activities on offer such as go karting, fairground, music concert, bars,
restaurants, the iconic Dunlop Bridge and more notably a fantastic vantage
point for watching the racing. The pits, grandstands and circuit village are 5
minutes walk from our site so you have everything within easy reach.</p>
<p><b>Itinerary</b><br/></p>
<p>Here at PWF we keep
things fairly informal with regards to organised fun, we understand our
entrants will want to enjoy the atmosphere at their own pace and as such suggest places to visit.</p>
<p>If you decide to join
us on the items mentioned on the agenda then fantastic, if not it is completely
fine. The beauty of the endurance race is you can dip in and out of watching as
you wish and mix it up with the other things happening in and around the
circuit.</p>

<h4><b>Day 1</b></h4>

to enjoy all the fun of the fair, go karting is good fun and the big

 the course. Hang out opposite the pits as at night as they are fully

To The Pits - Be a ""Legend In Your Own Mind"" wearing the racing overalls, goggles and helmets our party can undertake a pit walk.Go Shopping - The ""Village"" is the place to be to pick up some souvenirs, a race radio and other essentials.Drivers Parade - Guided by Matthew MItchell, our party takes the tram to the Centre of Le Mans.Culinary Delights - While in the centre of Le Mans, it is a 
good opportunity to grab an evening meal and a few beers at one of the 
local restaurants before heading back to the circuit via the tram.Nightlife - For those who wish to carry on partying there is plenty of entertainment just yards from the Tertre Rouge campsite.
Day 3
Breakfast - Up bright and early as race day is here!Concert - Our group can take the opportunity to wander across to the stage opposite our campsite to enjoy the gig.
Warm Up - Grab your coffee and relax by the Dunlop Bridge opposite our campsite,  to witness the warm up laps and morning's racing.
Ready For The Off
 - Our group makes way to the start/finish straight and join the 
festival atmosphere. Sing along with the crowds and enjoy the pre-race 
action while jostling for a good place to stand.
Race Start - Watch as the cars set off on their 24hour adventure!

 Barbecue - Take a moment to enjoy a group barbecue at the camp site, with the background noise of the racing!

Fairground - Our group can take some time out from spectating 
to enjoy all the fun of the fair, go karting is good fun and the big 
wheel is a good vantage point to take aerial photographs of the circuit 
as darkness descends. As night falls, take a ride on the Ferris Wheel for a bird's eye view of
 the course. Hang out opposite the pits as at night as they are fully 
lit, this gives a ringside view to all the action and the work going on.
Day 4
Time Out - Take some time out from group activities, 
suggestions for something a little different are heading into the old 
town via the tram for a coffee and a croissant, taking in the famous 
Cathedral. Alternatively, take some time to visit the Le Mans Museum which is based
 within the circuit complex and approximately 10 minutes walk from the 
camp site. The Museum houses a fantastic collection of former race 
winning cars.
Final Stages - Time to 
head back to the start/finish line. Our group can find a spot near the 
barriers and watch he cars jostling for their final positions and the 
late drop outs limping back to the pits.
Finish - 
All done for another year, the barriers are pulled back and the huge 
crowds surge forward to the foot of the podium, our group joins in to 
complete the Le Mans experience, followed by a circuit walk back towards
 our campsite.
Relax - Time for the group to unwind, grab a bite to eat prior 
to eat and relax in readiness for departure tomorrow. Limiting the lager
 consumption as some of the party will be driving early the next 
morning!
Day 5
Leave Le Mans - Tents packed up and en route to Calais, lead by Matthew Mitchell
Port Of Calais - Arrive 1 hour before the ferry departs (12:35) to ensure the group boards successfully.
Board Ferry - Grab a bite to eat ( food and drink not included 
in the package price ), take time to look at duty and generally take the
 opportunity to relax prior to further driving back in the UK.

Port Of Dover - Arrival back in the UK. Here is where the group will either stick together en route back home or disperse and follow their own agendas in readiness for the next year!

<h3>Why wear an automatic watch? </h3>
<p>Mechanical watches have hundreds of tiny gears moving together as one and are characterised by the smooth glide of the seconds hand across the watch face. They are powered by hand-winding and in the case of an automatic like ours, the motions of the wearer's wrist are converted into energy by means of a rotor and powers the watch- there are no batteries in our watches! </p>
<p>Generally, the world of mechanical watches is a niche market, and one dominated by men. Mechanical wristwatches comprise only 3% of the international watch market, out of which three-quarters comprises men’s watches. This means that less than 1% of watches in the world comprise of ladies mechanical wristwatches. We hope to introduce women to the beauty of mechanical watches and change the way women wear and think about watches, one watch at a time!    </p>

It was difficult for me to find a mechanical watch that I liked or could afford; the options available were either too masculine or overly-decorated.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Over the last 18 months, we've sought out the most premium materials we could use in sunglasses, worked tirelessly to combine them into one perfect package and communicated all our needs to many suppliers across the globe. We narrowed down our list to the perfect three suppliers, all proficient in making sunglasses and who have already made some of the pairs you see on the campaign. Our supply chain - from raw materials to shipping - is readily prepared to take on any magnitude of preorders. Our manufacturers have direct connections to the suppliers and our warehousing team where your sunglasses will be quality checked, packed and sealed to go out to you. It’s our mission to ensure everyone has a chance to see the world in a new light.</p>

Risks and challenges
Over the last 18 months, we've sought out the most premium materials we could use in sunglasses, worked tirelessly to combine them into one perfect package and communicated all our needs to many suppliers across the globe. We narrowed down our list to the perfect three suppliers, all proficient in making sunglasses and who have already made some of the pairs you see on the campaign. Our supply chain - from raw materials to shipping - is readily prepared to take on any magnitude of preorders. Our manufacturers have direct connections to the suppliers and our warehousing team where your sunglasses will be quality checked, packed and sealed to go out to you. It’s our mission to ensure everyone has a chance to see the world in a new light.



Environmental commitments
Indiegogo encourages sustainable practices.


Long-lasting design
The lenses are crafted in a specialist way to ensure that they're able to stand a lot of impact without smashing into your eyes. This way we can ensure you're out of harm's way and enjoying your sunglasses.


Sustainable materials
Our sunglasses frames are made from 100% recycled ABS plastic which itself can be 100% recycled.


Sustainable Distribution
We only use sustainably sourced Eco-Friendly packaging with all our sunglasses to lessen our impact on the environment.

<p>We created MGTHA (pronounced Mangutha) with the aim of bringing high quality minimalist watches, that can be worn in any situation be it casual or professional, at an affordable price. We create our watches with the belief that class and style should not need to be at breakneck prices, but affordable for those that are looking.</p>
<p>We want to create a community of people who share the same passion for watches as us, and then help that community define their own style and make a statement, resulting in MGTHA Watches being founded.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>So to speak about where the funding will go in more detail!</p>
<p>First of all, the funding will be used to produce our first batch of watches. We have found a reliable, high-status manufacturer, with many years of working in the business, who have produced watches for Tom Carter Watch. This first batch will be a batch of 100. </p>
<p>The second aspect any donations will be going to is website development. We currently have our own domain - <a href=""https://mgtha.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://mgtha.com</a> and we will be hiring a professional website builder. All of this section will cost us around £300.</p>
<p>The third and final aspect donations will be going towards is advertising. This is arguably the most important aspect, so we can grow the MGTHA Community. This advertising will be primarily done through Facebook, as this is the biggest social media outlet, and we are firm believers in social media having the potential to create an inter branching network of similarly minded people worldwide. The advertising will also be done using googleads, as google is the largest search engine in the world. We have already begun the social media development, with our instagram growing brilliantly in the 2/3 weeks we have had it active, already at 15,000 followers! You can find our instagram here - <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mgtha/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/mgtha/</a> . This advertising will cost around £700.</p>

<h3>How do you get your watches?</h3>
<div>This began with us designing the watch, and deciding on specifications with the manufacturers. They are currently creating a sample, which will be sent to us, for confirmation. If the sample is how we want the watches to look, we send over the payment for the first batch of watches, which then begin production. Once production is completed, we get sent the watches, and we then send them to you!<br/>

</span></div>","Oct 2014 while working out together, we came up
with the idea of designing a Lifestyle Brand because (1) Most Brands are Commercial
styles Promoted by their Endorsement of Professional Athletes & Wearable
Banners promoting the Company brand, (2) Most affordable styles consist of Basic
Fabric combinations which don’t always feel good on the body nor do they respond
well to Wet Dry Conditions or Body Types, & (3) We represent Millions of People who
Believe in Hard Work and Dedication. Those who Put their Time and Effort into
Becoming Better. We formed the PWR Brand for Those who NEVERSTOP.We’re
Not Here Asking You To Fund an Idea! We’re Asking You To Help Expand a Real
Life Brand That’s Already Growing! We Wanted to Make a Brand that Represents
Your Need to Keep Pushing Life to the Limit and NEVERSTOP so We took our
Savings went to Work! First we worked with Manufacturers to come up with Our
Signature PWRDRY™ Fabric to allow a more breathable Quick Dry Function to the
Look and Fit of Each Style created. We wanted PWR to be Stylish, Comfortable
and Designed to Fit an Active Lifestyle so once the Material was Created, We
Started Building the Brand! 
The Picture Below is a PWR Employee’s  Shirt That They’ve Worn & Washed Over 10
Times. Notice How Tightly Knit The Fabric is Even After Multiple Washes! Our
PWRDRY Fabric and Knit Pattern Allows for a More Breathable Solution That Dries
Quicker Allowing You To Tackle Your Lifestyle Without The Uncomfortable Long-term Moisture Feeling on Your Body.

NEVERSTOP is Not Just A Slogan, 
It's How Each of Us Live Out Each Day!From the Moment We're Born, we NEVERSTOP Trying to Overcome Obstacles and Reach New Goals. Whether You’re Young or Experienced in Life, The Importance
      of our Ability to NEVERSTOP is the Reason We Get Up, Get Out and Fight
      each Day to Be Better for Ourselves and Others.Clothing is a basic necessity in our Lives and what we wear often
represents what we like, what we believe and who we are. What You Wear Should
Be a Positive Reflection of Who You Are. Not The Other Way Around. That’s PWR.
And Supporting a Brand that Reflects Your Desire to Never Give Up, Never Settle
and above all NEVERSTOP is the key to Making PWR Apparel a Successful Brand in
Today’s Market.


We’re working hard each day to make sure we stay dedicated to those who have chosen
to make PWR Apparel a part of their Lifestyle Journey. We Jumped in this Huge Ocean Head First to Build a Company Everyone Could
      Be a Part of. We have gone from 500 Instagram Followers to Over 60,000
      since August 2015. Our NEVERSTOP Phrase has resulted in a massive
      Consumer Following Online and our Apparel and Bands are popping up
      online all over the World from People Embracing the PWR Brand!The Challenges We Can Overcome With Your Help!
The
Key to Being Successful in this Market is the Ability to Mass Produce our
PWRDRY Fabric, Quality Styles and Designs at a low cost. This is where we are
struggling! We need to increase our Fabric Manufacturing Quantity so that we
can greatly reduce our Cost per Item. This will allow us to be More competitive
in providing Quality Styles at a Pricing Level that will Allow Us to
Compete in This Market and Bring the NEVERSTOP slogan to the World! 

The Costs for Manufacturing and Producing our Full Line will max around $13k. With
the fees associated with running this Campaign, hitting our Target amount will
Secure our Full Line Release to Market! Successfully reaching our Target Goal
will bring our overall item cost to consumer down 12-15% below industry
competitors for similar apparel of matched quality and standard.
What Happens if We Don’t Reach Our Goal?
Regardless of the Financial
Outcome, we are dedicated to Pushing PWR to Market. We are Putting Every dime
back into PWR to Continue to Grow Our Consumer Base. It’s So Exciting To See
How Far We’ve Come in a Market Dominated by the Few Elite Brands that Control a

<p>My name is Joe Tolman, founder of <strong>Hula Cula®, </strong>and I would like to introduce you to the World's first high-function, high-fashion cooler bag.</p>
<p>Using only premium materials, <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> has the DNA of a high-end designer handbag, but hidden inside that beautiful exterior is the most functional women’s cooler bag ever created. Every facet and feel of this bag is designed to meet the many needs and desires of women in today’s crazy-busy world.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at all the amazing aspects of <strong>Hula Cula™</strong> and how it can help make your life more <strong>FUN</strong>, <strong>FUNCTIONAL</strong> and <strong>FASHIONABLE!</strong></p>

<h3><i><strong>Fun</strong></i></h3>
<p>The <strong>FUN</strong> in the  <strong>FUNCSHION™</strong> of the <strong>Hula Cula® </strong>is the bright and playful, Hawaiian-inspired patterns that the bag comes in. The patterns were designed specifically to appeal to many different personality types. We met with focus groups of women over a period of several months to help define a line of colors and patterns that would appeal to the greatest number of women. Below is a photo and description of each bag, which one is your favorite?</p>

<h3><i><strong>Fashion</strong></i></h3>
<p>Let’s talk <strong>FASHION!</strong> You’ve seen the fun patterns that the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> comes in, now we’ll talk about the high end materials the bag is constructed of that make this bag High Fashion!</p>
<p><br/>We’ll start with the first thing you see, the vibrant printed leather. Made of vegan synthetic leather, it has a super soft, buttery feel with a genuine leather texture that makes it luxurious, but keep it easy to clean. This bag is made for adventure, so being easy to clean is essential! The material is water resistant, hand-washable, and is a brilliant white that allows our prints to show their true colors. One touch and you’ll be falling in love.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537116754/taobdshewoa3yzw5ue57.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

This textured leather, made famous by Mario Prada in the early 1900’s, is the material of choice for many top designer handbag companies because of its water resistance, durability, easy maintenance, and elegant look. You can feel confident that the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> will stand up to every element you throw at it in your everyday adventures, all the while looking <i>FABULOUS!</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537619655/nxb2tspm9k3vxiujdx0t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our waterproof zippers are effortless to operate, help retain temperature, keep spills inside the bag, and the elements out ... and they look amazing doing it! We’ve designed the bag to showcase these beauties, using black Saffiano so the magenta zippers can stand in the spotlight. A fashion detail not to be ignored.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong><i>Function</i></strong></h2>
<p>The zippers are a great segue from the <strong>FASHION</strong> aspects of the bag, to the <strong>FUNCTION</strong>, as they are certainly a vital part of both. The zippers are the entry way to the three pockets of the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong>: the center <strong>Cooler Pocket</strong>, the <strong>Dry Storage Pocket</strong>, and the <strong>Utility Pocket</strong>.</p>
<h3><i><strong>Cooler Pocket</strong></i></h3>
<p>The largest of the three pockets, the Cooler Pocket is lined with a half-inch thick dual layer of lightweight, flexible, vapor-resistant insulation that will keep the cooler pocket warm or cold even in extreme environments, for hours on end, no less.</p>
<p>Featured inside the Cooler Pocket, is an easy to clean waterproof lining and three padded/insulated adjustable velcro dividers. These dividers allow you to separate items, and keep them upright, without bumping in to each other. Great for keeping wine or glass milk bottles safe! The dividers can also be easily removed if you would like to use the full compartment.</p>
<p>All-in-all, an extremely functional pocket that will keep your drinks, medication, groceries, etc, at the proper temperature, and safe from breakage of spilling.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537117609/mrgbuukqx8u1rwloqdqb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><i><strong>Utility Pocket</strong></i></h3>
<p>Three phone sized pockets, a zippered valuables pocket, plenty of room for your laptop, iPad or kindle, and a key clip for easy key access ... it’s called <strong>Utility</strong>, and it’s wrapped in a beautiful shade of magenta! This is the part of the bag that acts as your handbag or pocketbook normally would. Keep you phones, wallet, keys, credit cards, computer, check book and anything else you need easy access to, in this convenient pocket. This pocket also houses our <strong>Hula Juice™</strong> solar charging station!</p>
<h3><strong><i>Dry Storage Pocket</i></strong></h3>
<p>On the other side is the <strong>Dry Storage</strong> pocket, with its vibrant green lining. This is the part of the bag that takes the place of your tote. Here you can keep magazines, clothing, towels, equipment, as well as keep your sunglasses clean and safe in the built in sunglass pocket. We made the pocket green to differentiate it from the Utility Pocket, so when you are sending your little ones in to the bag to get something for you, it is much easier for them to find the ""green"" pocket or the ""pink"" pocket. <i><strong>Detail to make your life easier!</strong></i></p>

<h3><strong><i>Accessories</i></strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> experience doesn't end with the bag, itself. We have developed a few accessories that turn an already amazing bag in to something truly exceptional.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537296208/zbfpv3damjgf73z0nb7a.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<p>Function is what the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> is all about, and the <strong>Hula Juice™</strong> is one of its key accessories. No more crying kids because their game ran out of battery. No more dead phone at the most inopportune time. With our solar powered charging station, you can set it and forget it in the <strong>Utility Pocket</strong> and charge two devices at once, or take it out and use it where you need it! You can charge anything that uses a USB charger, and with it's 20,000 mAh power. you can charge several devices on one charge.</p>
<p>Phones, iPads, Kindles, bluetooth devices, you name it!! It has a charging cable to charge it traditionally, but with its solar charging panel you can rest assured you can charge your devices all day at the beach or ball field. Did I mention that it comes with your own personal usb fan? Can it get any Cula? I don’t think so!!</p>

<p>Maybe the most exciting and innovative part of the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> brand is our patent-pending <strong>Hula Skurt™</strong>, our targeted, flexible, heating/cooling system for the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong>.</p>
<p>The function of these gel packs is revolutionary. There are six different patterned <strong>Hula Skurts™</strong> to match the six different bags. The <strong>Hula Skurts™</strong> are made out of custom printed, high stretch material, and have 100% gel panels sewn in. This gel will stay frozen 5 times longer than ice, so combined with the superior insulation in the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong>, you are able to keep things hot or cold all day or night.</p>
<p>With the stretch-to-fit properties of the <strong>Hula Skurt™</strong>, you can choose which items you would like to keep hot or cold, rather than just lining your cooler with hard, flat cold packs, or the mess of dealing with ice. Targeting your items is more efficient, since you are directly cooling or heating the item, rather than the air inside the bag. The <strong>Hula Skurt™</strong> is 6"" tall and can easily stretch to fit around a half gallon of milk, most any size bottle of wine, and even a four pack of 16oz cans. And if you don't want to wrap anything with the Skurt? The gel pack will lay flat to use in a traditional manner. They are washable, beautiful, and make unpacking and keeping your bag clean, so much easier!</p>
<p>We don't stop there, we also have a smaller version of the <strong>Hula Skurt™</strong>, called the <strong>Mini Skurt™</strong>! The <strong>Mini Skurt™</strong> is half the size of the <strong>Hula Skurt™</strong>, so it is great for targeting individual cans or bottles, and you can keep the <strong>Mini Skurt™</strong> on your beverage to keep it hot or cold once you take it out of the cooler. No need to worry about that drink getting warm in the hot summer sun! The <strong>Mini Skurts™</strong> comes in a six-pack; all in one of the patterns, or a six pack featuring one of each pattern. <strong>So much fun!</strong></p>
<p>Keeping your drinks hot or cold aren't the only use for the <strong>Hula Skurts™</strong>, you can also use these versatile gel packs for therapeutic purposes. Did your child just twist his ankle at the soccer game? No problem, just grab a <strong>Hula Skurt™</strong> from the bag and slip it on. Hot or cold therapy couldn't be any easier, or fun!</p>

<p>The perfect compliment to the <strong>HULA CULA®</strong>, the Coconut™ Bluetooth speaker is tiny, but packs massive sound! With its beautiful rosewood exterior, laser engraved with out Three Palm logo, the Coconut™ offers premium audio with a double bass component in a very small and convenient 3"" diameter size. Just connect it to any of your electronics with bluetooth capabilities and bring the party wherever you go. Perfect for your desk, golf cart, the ball field, picnics, dinners on the deck, and especially the beach, where the bass is so deep, it will make the sand around it dance. <i><strong>YOU WILL LOVE THIS SPEAKER!</strong></i></p>

<h3><i><strong>Timeline and delivery projections</strong></i></h3>
<p>Below is our timeline from beginning to projected end of this initial campaign. Of course, we can only project a timeline for our manufacturing and shipping. We have built in some cushion in production, just because we expect there to be delays, as there always seems to be. But we will be a very active participant in the manufacture of our products to make sure the quality is what we expect. There will be no rushing of these products at the expense of quality. We expect our products to be of the highest integrity, and something you will be very proud to own and display. After all, we know that happy customers are our best salespeople. So we not only want to satisfy you with our products, but exceed your expectations.</p>

<p><strong>This is the face of Hula Cula®</strong> </p>
<p>Meet Joe, Karli, Jordan and Nick Tolman. Joe and Karli are the driving force behind the brand, and their children, Jordan and Nick, are crucial cogs in the concept and development of the products.</p>
<p>For the past 25 years Joe has owned and operated a very successful design company in New Hampshire. After getting married in 2004, Karli came on board and has run the day-to-day operation of the business. Jordan and Nick have both started working for the family driven business after graduating from college.</p>
<p>After all those years of creating the image and campaigns for numerous companies, Joe has had a desire to create something that is his own. In walks the Hula Cula®.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537622888/ilylisuwy094rrxoabfo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There is a tremendous presence of high end cooler products in the market today. The only problem is, they are heavily geared towards men. The design, functionality, marketing, and even the company names, are meant to evoke manliness, durability and COLD! This isn't a bad thing, they are hugely successful and remarkably effective. We own several ourselves, which led to an interesting situation. On multiple occasions, when bragging about the fantastic qualities of our coolers, we found many women who would state that they're great and all, but what woman is going to carry one of those things around?  We didn't have an answer.</p>
<p>In early summer 2017, Joe had a dream, as corny as it sounds. In that dream he envisioned a bag, with a vibrant floral print and bright pink zippers. The pattern that would become our Waikiki bag. Jumping out of bed to sketch the image, the concept and name for the bags came within minutes, the URL was purchased, and the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538082961/fg7ew8mkdvnhxktqgvl7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of the premium products on the market are made to be heavy, indestructible, sturdy and keep ice cold for days and days on end. A wonderful thing for men who love to hunt, fish, camp and hike. And all of them have names of icy cold things.</p>
<p>The concept behind the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> is the exact opposite. A soft, luxurious bag with bright patterns and premium materials that meets the needs and desires of women on the go with their children, family and friends. A bag that has every function she would need in one place, but had the look and feel of a high end designer handbag. A cooler with premium insulation, but light enough to be easily carried, and keep things warm or cold for a day, not a week. We were looking to create the ultimate soccer mom bag! A bag with a name that resonates the places you want to use this bag, in warm sunny breezes! The beach, the ball field, picnics and poolside.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538083129/er0hfriz2vrtx31vpeon.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the concept was born in a morning, and it all made sense. But was there anything like it already? Through extensive research, we found exactly nothing. In fact, amazingly nothing even close. There are cute lightly insulated cooler totes for women, and premium insulated bags for men, but nothing like what Joe had envisioned. So after designing conceptual patterns and mock-ups, focus groups were organized over a period of several months. All with the intent of finding out what women from all different demographics would want to see in such a bag. Through this process, we took all the feedback and turned it in to the World's first high-function, high-fashion cooler bag.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537622914/kli96cadrygnhcyrlwq1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><i><strong>The Process</strong></i></h3>
<p>It took a while, but we did find a manufacturer who could produce our prototype. Not an easy thing, it wasn't something that had been produced before. It took a lot of time and a lot of communication to produce what we were looking for. In June of 2018, the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> came to life!</p>
<p>We immediately started testing the bag, and the prototype wasn't perfect, we had some adjustments to make in design, materials and hardware ... <i>but it was beautiful!</i>  Our first Prototype is the Maui bag. You'll see it in most of the promotional shots here on the site and in the video. We needed to adjust the strap rings and change the fabric. We also started out with the idea of a 3D patch for the bag. You will see this patch on the Maui bag in many of our photos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538083368/d97ppccgfwahqoxywbfv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We began working on the second prototype very quickly, and soon after we had the Turtle Bay prototype done. We nailed the fabric this time, and the strap ring adjustment worked exactly how we hoped.</p>
<p>We also decided we really wanted to showcase our Three Palm logo on the bags, so we changed to a gold metal symbol for the bags. In doing so, we also switched the hardware from gun metal to gold to match the symbol.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538129307/s0v5lsjcsucrymb5i7b8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In testing, we discovered we needed to add more structural Saffiano leather to the sides of the bag, and an additional inch to the top as well. This was one of those happy things that happens through testing, as ideas evolve. When heavier, the weight was pulling on the printed leather, causing it to pull. We needed some final refinements.</p>
<p>We continued the Saffiano up each side of the bag, but not just a straight strip. Instead, the leather comes down the sides and gently arcs to meet the base on both sides, creating a beautiful feminine profile, and better showcasing the vibrant bag patterns. With the addition of the gold Three Palm symbol to each end, we have arrived at the final look of the <strong>Hula Cula®</strong>, and we know you will agree, it is striking!</p>

<h3><i><strong>The End Game</strong></i></h3>
<p>We chose <strong>Indiegogo</strong> as our platform because of the tremendous success stories it has produced, and the support that the company and its supporters offer to entrepreneurs with new ideas. We knew we had a product that was revolutionary and would resonate with people, so we see it as a perfect fit for us and our business.</p>
<h3><i><strong>Our goals and how you can help</strong></i></h3>
<p>Our main goal is to build a brand, not a product. We see this revolutionary product package as a gateway in to creating our very own market, since currently there is no market for high-end women's cooler bags. So we are offering you some <i><strong>incredible discounts</strong></i> on the bags as perks of this campaign.</p>
<p>We have a flexible goal of $50,000. Our first goal is to raise enough money to manufacture our early adopter orders (that's you!) while also being able to produce a relatively substantial inventory that we can sell as InDemand product in the marketplace and from our web site, to start.</p>
<p>If we can achieve this first goal, it will allow us to cover our costs on the development of our products, which includes materials, travel, prototyping and marketing, as well as the our costs for our intellectual properties. We have chosen to try and protect all of our ideas through trademark and patent protection. You will notice all of the ™ and ® symbols throughout this campaign text. The <strong>Hula Cula®</strong> name is already registered, and our Three Palm symbol is in the process now. We also have patent applications in for other aspects of our products. We know we have something special, so we want to protect our company, and the products you purchase, in every way possible.</p>

<h3><strong>#keepitcula</strong></h3>
</div></div>","My name is Joe Tolman, founder of Hula Cula®, and I would like to introduce you to the World's first high-function, high-fashion cooler bag.
Using only premium materials, Hula Cula® has the DNA of a high-end designer handbag, but hidden inside that beautiful exterior is the most functional women’s cooler bag ever created. Every facet and feel of this bag is designed to meet the many needs and desires of women in today’s crazy-busy world.
Let's take a look at all the amazing aspects of Hula Cula™ and how it can help make your life more FUN, FUNCTIONAL and FASHIONABLE!


 

Fun
The FUN in the  FUNCSHION™ of the Hula Cula® is the bright and playful, Hawaiian-inspired patterns that the bag comes in. The patterns were designed specifically to appeal to many different personality types. We met with focus groups of women over a period of several months to help define a line of colors and patterns that would appeal to the greatest number of women. Below is a photo and description of each bag, which one is your favorite?
 
   



Fashion
Let’s talk FASHION! You’ve seen the fun patterns that the Hula Cula® comes in, now we’ll talk about the high end materials the bag is constructed of that make this bag High Fashion!
We’ll start with the first thing you see, the vibrant printed leather. Made of vegan synthetic leather, it has a super soft, buttery feel with a genuine leather texture that makes it luxurious, but keep it easy to clean. This bag is made for adventure, so being easy to clean is essential! The material is water resistant, hand-washable, and is a brilliant white that allows our prints to show their true colors. One touch and you’ll be falling in love.

Saffiano is the black structural leather for the Hula Cula®. This textured leather, made famous by Mario Prada in the early 1900’s, is the material of choice for many top designer handbag companies because of its water resistance, durability, easy maintenance, and elegant look. You can feel confident that the Hula Cula® will stand up to every element you throw at it in your everyday adventures, all the while looking FABULOUS!

Our waterproof zippers are effortless to operate, help retain temperature, keep spills inside the bag, and the elements out ... and they look amazing doing it! We’ve designed the bag to showcase these beauties, using black Saffiano so the magenta zippers can stand in the spotlight. A fashion detail not to be ignored.

 

 
Function
The zippers are a great segue from the FASHION aspects of the bag, to the FUNCTION, as they are certainly a vital part of both. The zippers are the entry way to the three pockets of the Hula Cula®: the center Cooler Pocket, the Dry Storage Pocket, and the Utility Pocket.
Cooler Pocket
The largest of the three pockets, the Cooler Pocket is lined with a half-inch thick dual layer of lightweight, flexible, vapor-resistant insulation that will keep the cooler pocket warm or cold even in extreme environments, for hours on end, no less.
Featured inside the Cooler Pocket, is an easy to clean waterproof lining and three padded/insulated adjustable velcro dividers. These dividers allow you to separate items, and keep them upright, without bumping in to each other. Great for keeping wine or glass milk bottles safe! The dividers can also be easily removed if you would like to use the full compartment.
All-in-all, an extremely functional pocket that will keep your drinks, medication, groceries, etc, at the proper temperature, and safe from breakage of spilling.


 
Utility Pocket
Three phone sized pockets, a zippered valuables pocket, plenty of room for your laptop, iPad or kindle, and a key clip for easy key access ... it’s called Utility, and it’s wrapped in a beautiful shade of magenta! This is the part of the bag that acts as your handbag or pocketbook normally would. Keep you phones, wallet, keys, credit cards, computer, check book and anything else you need easy access to, in this convenient pocket. This pocket also houses our Hula Juice™ solar charging station!
Dry Storage Pocket
On the other side is the Dry Storage pocket, with its vibrant green lining. This is the part of the bag that takes the place of your tote. Here you can keep magazines, clothing, towels, equipment, as well as keep your sunglasses clean and safe in the built in sunglass pocket. We made the pocket green to differentiate it from the Utility Pocket, so when you are sending your little ones in to the bag to get something for you, it is much easier for them to find the ""green"" pocket or the ""pink"" pocket. Detail to make your life easier!
 


 

Accessories
The Hula Cula® experience doesn't end with the bag, itself. We have developed a few accessories that turn an already amazing bag in to something truly exceptional.
 

Function is what the Hula Cula® is all about, and the Hula Juice™ is one of its key accessories. No more crying kids because their game ran out of battery. No more dead phone at the most inopportune time. With our solar powered charging station, you can set it and forget it in the Utility Pocket and charge two devices at once, or take it out and use it where you need it! You can charge anything that uses a USB charger, and with it's 20,000 mAh power. you can charge several devices on one charge.
Phones, iPads, Kindles, bluetooth devices, you name it!! It has a charging cable to charge it traditionally, but with its solar charging panel you can rest assured you can charge your devices all day at the beach or ball field. Did I mention that it comes with your own personal usb fan? Can it get any Cula? I don’t think so!!




Maybe the most exciting and innovative part of the Hula Cula® brand is our patent-pending Hula Skurt™, our targeted, flexible, heating/cooling system for the Hula Cula®.
The function of these gel packs is revolutionary. There are six different patterned Hula Skurts™ to match the six different bags. The Hula Skurts™ are made out of custom printed, high stretch material, and have 100% gel panels sewn in. This gel will stay frozen 5 times longer than ice, so combined with the superior insulation in the Hula Cula®, you are able to keep things hot or cold all day or night.
With the stretch-to-fit properties of the Hula Skurt™, you can choose which items you would like to keep hot or cold, rather than just lining your cooler with hard, flat cold packs, or the mess of dealing with ice. Targeting your items is more efficient, since you are directly cooling or heating the item, rather than the air inside the bag. The Hula Skurt™ is 6"" tall and can easily stretch to fit around a half gallon of milk, most any size bottle of wine, and even a four pack of 16oz cans. And if you don't want to wrap anything with the Skurt? The gel pack will lay flat to use in a traditional manner. They are washable, beautiful, and make unpacking and keeping your bag clean, so much easier!
We don't stop there, we also have a smaller version of the Hula Skurt™, called the Mini Skurt™! The Mini Skurt™ is half the size of the Hula Skurt™, so it is great for targeting individual cans or bottles, and you can keep the Mini Skurt™ on your beverage to keep it hot or cold once you take it out of the cooler. No need to worry about that drink getting warm in the hot summer sun! The Mini Skurts™ comes in a six-pack; all in one of the patterns, or a six pack featuring one of each pattern. So much fun!
Keeping your drinks hot or cold aren't the only use for the Hula Skurts™, you can also use these versatile gel packs for therapeutic purposes. Did your child just twist his ankle at the soccer game? No problem, just grab a Hula Skurt™ from the bag and slip it on. Hot or cold therapy couldn't be any easier, or fun!
 


 



The perfect compliment to the HULA CULA®, the Coconut™ Bluetooth speaker is tiny, but packs massive sound! With its beautiful rosewood exterior, laser engraved with out Three Palm logo, the Coconut™ offers premium audio with a double bass component in a very small and convenient 3"" diameter size. Just connect it to any of your electronics with bluetooth capabilities and bring the party wherever you go. Perfect for your desk, golf cart, the ball field, picnics, dinners on the deck, and especially the beach, where the bass is so deep, it will make the sand around it dance. YOU WILL LOVE THIS SPEAKER!



Timeline and delivery projections
Below is our timeline from beginning to projected end of this initial campaign. Of course, we can only project a timeline for our manufacturing and shipping. We have built in some cushion in production, just because we expect there to be delays, as there always seems to be. But we will be a very active participant in the manufacture of our products to make sure the quality is what we expect. There will be no rushing of these products at the expense of quality. We expect our products to be of the highest integrity, and something you will be very proud to own and display. After all, we know that happy customers are our best salespeople. So we not only want to satisfy you with our products, but exceed your expectations.

<h3>Who Am I? </h3>
<p>My name is Monique Glover (aka Mo Glover) and I was raised in Brooklyn, NY. My love for my family and hometown prompted my decision to stay close by and get my degree from Pratt Institute. The decision to create this campaign was not an easy one. Working hard and being self-sufficient is a trait that I have carried with pride. After experiencing the challenges of not only becoming an Entrepreneur, but also as a single mother, I have learned that success takes not just time and hard work but a good support system. After working for numerous companies, assisting in their brands' needs by maintaining their design and quality aesthetic, I decided it was time for me to put my own brand and aesthetic in the forefront. The help from contributors will take my brand to a level where it can compete and be placed on a similar platform as larger brands with more backing. I will be able to complete a full Spring/Summer presentation, present a show at a brand appropriate platform, maintain production for Fall Season, and build more web/social media presence. This has become a true dream come true and I thank you all for joining the journey. Thank you for supporting and rooting for me. </p>

My name is Monique Glover (aka Mo Glover) and I was raised in Brooklyn, NY. My love for my family and hometown prompted my decision to stay close by and get my degree from Pratt Institute. The decision to create this campaign was not an easy one. Working hard and being self-sufficient is a trait that I have carried with pride. After experiencing the challenges of not only becoming an Entrepreneur, but also as a single mother, I have learned that success takes not just time and hard work but a good support system. After working for numerous companies, assisting in their brands' needs by maintaining their design and quality aesthetic, I decided it was time for me to put my own brand and aesthetic in the forefront. The help from contributors will take my brand to a level where it can compete and be placed on a similar platform as larger brands with more backing. I will be able to complete a full Spring/Summer presentation, present a show at a brand appropriate platform, maintain production for Fall Season, and build more web/social media presence. This has become a true dream come true and I thank you all for joining the journey. Thank you for supporting and rooting for me. 

What Do I Need & What You Get
My project requires funding of $4000.
It will be going to the following places-
(1) The fee to present through Fashion Week Brooklyn
(2) The execution of Zyem Spring/Summer 2018 prototypes which will include Menswear and Kidswear. This includes art supplies (paint/canvas), fabric, trim, embroidery and screen-printing fees. 
- Contributors Perks have been broken down as follows-

A tribe of about 70,000 that has lived far from the civilized world, spread throughout some 18,000km2 of mangrove, tidal swamp, freshwater swamp, and lowland rainforest, in the Papua province of Indonesia, has its children falling victim to the most curable diseases due to an entire lack of basic sanitation, healthcare and proper food. The decades-old gold mining activities in the region never benefited the locals. Even today, as infrastructure is growing, the benefits are not trickling down to the Asmat people. That’s why we decided to do something about it – because, at the end of the day, a group of individuals can bring the kind of change that no government ever could.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522757907/tgdnausanxalufiinxis.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><i>Alors qu'ils vivent dans une région riche en ressources, et malgré le fait que leurs œuvres de sculpture sur bois en ont fait l'un des musées les plus importants du monde, les Asmat sont, pour la plupart, une tribu ignorée à supporter les conditions de vie les plus dures . Une tribu d'environ 70 000 personnes vivant loin du monde civilisé, disséminée sur environ 18 000 km2 de mangroves, marécages, marais d'eau douce et forêt pluviale de basse altitude, dans la province indonésienne de Papouasie, a été victime des maladies les plus curables à un manque total d'assainissement de base, de soins de santé et de bonne nourriture. Les activités d'extraction de l'or dans la région depuis des dizaines d'années n'ont jamais profité aux habitants. Même aujourd'hui, à mesure que les infrastructures se développent, les avantages ne se répercutent pas sur le peuple Asmat. C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de faire quelque chose à ce sujet - car, en fin de compte, un groupe d'individus peut apporter le genre de changement qu'aucun gouvernement ne pourrait jamais apporter</i>.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>No Big Organizations, Just Volunteers with a Big Heart</strong></h2><p>We’re not working with large organizations. Sadly, the Asmat are not popular aid receivers. On the contrary, we’re a small group of individuals, volunteering directly on the spot. What we would call the facilities based on which we work to help the Asmat in Merauke, Papua, are really very humble favela-like constructions made of scraps. Still, that’s where we have a school working to provide some education to the Asmat children. The facilities are indeed poor, but at least everything that we raise – from funds to goods and people’s volunteer time – goes directly to these children, instead of being absorbed by large NGOs operational expenses. We’re not a big structure, but our hearts are big enough for everyone within the Asmat world.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522688444/lcunac9remtpqseylq0i.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Nous ne travaillons pas avec de grandes organisations.

In fact, proper food is so scarce for these children, that it’s the only reason that brings them to our school – their parents do not fully appreciate the importance of education, but they sure are happy to send their children to a place where they are all fed. This means that <strong>the</strong> <strong>Asmat children come to class every morning </strong>and go back to their families in the afternoon, with at least some nourishment. Yes, this is challenging, but we remain hopeful.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522689030/jvmgjjospreg4c7aadxn.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Ce n'est pas une tâche facile, cependant. <strong>La dénutrition</strong>, causée par le fait qu'ils ne mangent qu'une fois par jour, et <strong>la rougeole, le paludisme et la diphtérie</strong> entraînent des décès fréquents.

When I first got to Indonesia, my primary goal of pursuing business studies quickly became secondary, as I fell in love with the country and realized that several environmental and human challenges needed urgent responses. That’s why I decided to create a product line that helps both people and the planet. // C'est essentiellement ce que fait WiWi Shoes. Quand je suis arrivé en Indonésie, mon objectif principal de poursuivre des études commerciales est rapidement devenu secondaire, car je suis tombé amoureux du pays et j'ai réalisé que plusieurs défis environnementaux et humains nécessitaient des réponses urgentes. C'est pourquoi j'ai décidé de créer une gamme de produits qui aide les gens et la planète.WiWi sneakers, sandals and wallets are made from recycled tires, canvas, cork, as well as of traditional tenun silk scraps (from Tenun Gaya by Wignyo)– both as a way of putting the circular economy helping and healing the planet and of honoring Indonesia’s beautiful craftsmanship and traditional silk work.Now, WiWi Shoes is taking on a new mission: to help the Asmat, and especially their children, to have better lives – just as they deserve. //Les sneakers, sandales et portefeuilles WiWi sont fabriqués à partir de pneus recyclés, de liège, ainsi que de tenun en soie traditionnellement tissé que nous récupérons (par Tenun Gaya by Wignyo), à la fois pour appliquer l'économie circulaire  et prendre soin de la planète et honorer la beauté artisanale et la soie traditionnelle indonésienne. Aujourd'hui, WiWi Shoes s'engage dans une nouvelle mission: aider les Asmats, et en particulier leurs enfants, à avoir une vie meilleure, comme ils le méritent.ATTENTION// The tenun we recycle is limited by colors and patterns and will evolve in function of the arriving stocks. Each pair is almost unique.ATTENTION//Le tenun que l'on recycle est limité par couleur et motif et les nuances peuvent évoluer en fonction des arrivages. Chaque paire est quasi unique. The Asmat: The Ignored Tribe of PapuaWhile they live in a resource-rich region, and despite the fact that their woodcarving artwork has made it into some of the world’s most prominent museums, the Asmat are, for the most part, an ignored tribe left to endure the harshest of living conditions. A tribe of about 70,000 that has lived far from the civilized world, spread throughout some 18,000km2 of mangrove, tidal swamp, freshwater swamp, and lowland rainforest, in the Papua province of Indonesia, has its children falling victim to the most curable diseases due to an entire lack of basic sanitation, healthcare and proper food. The decades-old gold mining activities in the region never benefited the locals. Even today, as infrastructure is growing, the benefits are not trickling down to the Asmat people. That’s why we decided to do something about it – because, at the end of the day, a group of individuals can bring the kind of change that no government ever could.Alors qu'ils vivent dans une région riche en ressources, et malgré le fait que leurs œuvres de sculpture sur bois en ont fait l'un des musées les plus importants du monde, les Asmat sont, pour la plupart, une tribu ignorée à supporter les conditions de vie les plus dures . Une tribu d'environ 70 000 personnes vivant loin du monde civilisé, disséminée sur environ 18 000 km2 de mangroves, marécages, marais d'eau douce et forêt pluviale de basse altitude, dans la province indonésienne de Papouasie, a été victime des maladies les plus curables à un manque total d'assainissement de base, de soins de santé et de bonne nourriture. Les activités d'extraction de l'or dans la région depuis des dizaines d'années n'ont jamais profité aux habitants. Même aujourd'hui, à mesure que les infrastructures se développent, les avantages ne se répercutent pas sur le peuple Asmat. C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de faire quelque chose à ce sujet - car, en fin de compte, un groupe d'individus peut apporter le genre de changement qu'aucun gouvernement ne pourrait jamais apporter. No Big Organizations, Just Volunteers with a Big HeartWe’re not working with large organizations. Sadly, the Asmat are not popular aid receivers. On the contrary, we’re a small group of individuals, volunteering directly on the spot. What we would call the facilities based on which we work to help the Asmat in Merauke, Papua, are really very humble favela-like constructions made of scraps. Still, that’s where we have a school working to provide some education to the Asmat children. The facilities are indeed poor, but at least everything that we raise – from funds to goods and people’s volunteer time – goes directly to these children, instead of being absorbed by large NGOs operational expenses. We’re not a big structure, but our hearts are big enough for everyone within the Asmat world.Nous ne travaillons pas avec de grandes organisations. Malheureusement, les Asmat ne sont pas de fréquents récepteurs d'aide. Au contraire, nous sommes un petit groupe de personnes, qui agit directement sur place. Ce que nous appellerions les installations dans lesquelles nous travaillons pour aider les Asmat à Merauke, en Papouasie, sont en réalité de très humbles constructions de favelas faites à partir de récupération. Pourtant, c'est là que nous avons une école qui agit pour fournir une éducation aux enfants Asmat. Les installations sont en effet précaires, mais au moins tout ce que nous collectons - des fonds aux biens et aux efforts des gens - va directement à ces enfants et leurs parents, au lieu d'être absorbé par les dépenses opérationnelles des grandes ONG. Nous ne sommes pas une grande structure, mais nos coeurs sont assez grands pour tout le monde dans le monde d'Asmat.Challenged, but HopefulThis is not an easy task, though. Undernutrition, caused by the fact that they eat only once a day, and measles, malaria, and diphtheria lead to frequent fatalities. In the last 4 months alone, 71 children died of causes that would be as simple to prevent as ensuring that they have 3 meals per day, and basic sanitation and healthcare. In fact, proper food is so scarce for these children, that it’s the only reason that brings them to our school – their parents do not fully appreciate the importance of education, but they sure are happy to send their children to a place where they are all fed. This means that the Asmat children come to class every morning and go back to their families in the afternoon, with at least some nourishment. Yes, this is challenging, but we remain hopeful.Ce n'est pas une tâche facile, cependant. La dénutrition, causée par le fait qu'ils ne mangent qu'une fois par jour, et la rougeole, le paludisme et la diphtérie entraînent des décès fréquents. Au cours des 4 derniers mois, 71 enfants sont morts de causes aussi simples à prévenir que de veiller à ce qu'ils prennent 3 repas par jour, ainsi que l'assainissement et les soins de santé de base. En fait, la nourriture adaptée à leur besoin est si rare pour ces enfants, que c'est la seule raison qui les amène à notre école - leurs parents n'apprécient pas pleinement l'importance de l'éducation, mais ils sont heureux d'envoyer leurs enfants à un endroit où ils sont tous nourris. Cela signifie que les enfants Asmat viennent en classe tous les matins et retournent dans leurs familles l'après-midi, avec au moins un peu de nourriture. Oui, c'est difficile, mais nous gardons espoir.Hygiene, Health, and EducationWhen you’re dealing with such a remotely located tribe, used to 40,000 years of isolation, every basic concept that we take for granted seems like a sophisticated concern that is pointless. //Lorsque vous traitez avec une tribu si éloignée, habituée à 40 000 ans d'isolement, chaque concept de base que nous tenons pour acquis semble être une préoccupation sophistiquée qui ne sert à rien.While they appreciate the chance of having at least one meal per day at our school, they are only now beginning to understand the importance of hygiene as a way of being healthier and stronger, and of education, as a way of having better chances of making something meaningful with their lives – namely to become educated advocates of their tribe and traditions. // Alors qu'ils apprécient la possibilité d'avoir au moins un repas par jour dans notre école, ils commencent seulement maintenant à comprendre l'importance de l'hygiène comme moyen d'être en meilleure santé et plus fort, et de l'éducation, comme un moyen d'avoir de meilleures chances d'avoir quelque chose de significatif dans leurs vies, d'avoir des rêves - à savoir devenir des avocats éduqués de leur tribu et de leurs traditions What We (Together With You) Can Do to HelpOur work has been bringing change to the Asmat tribe, but there is only so much we can do with our own resources. The volunteers who spend their entire days and means supporting these children struggle with everyday needs that we cannot, on our own, provide for.//Notre travail a apporté des changements à la tribu des Asmat, mais nous ne pouvons faire grand chose qu'avec nos propres ressources. Les volontaires qui consacrent leurs journées entières et leurs moyens à soutenir ces enfants sont aux prises avec des besoins quotidiens que nous ne pouvons, seuls, pourvoir. So, with your help, namely if you choose one of the great WiWi rewards that we have for you, we’ll be able to: 

Offer the Asmat children 3 nutritious meals per day instead of just 1//Offrir aux enfants Asmat 3 repas nutritifs par jour au lieu d'un seul de manière durable 

Allow them to shower with soap and teach them the basic life-changing hygiene habits that can save lives.//Pour leur permettre de se doucher avec du savon et leur enseigner les habitudes d'hygiène de base qui changent la vie et qui peuvent sauver des vies 

Provide them with vaccines for measles and malaria, as well as medicines when they are sick.//Pour leur fournir des vaccins contre la rougeole et le paludisme, ainsi que des médicaments quand ils sont malades 

Extend the healthcare support to the children’s mothers, who play a defining role in the children’s lives.//Pour étendre le soutien de la santé aux mères des enfants, qui jouent un rôle déterminant dans la vie des enfants

 Depending on how far your support helps us go, our stretch goals are: 

Offering the Asmat children medicines for ringworm, skin disease and vitamins for a better intellectual performance//Offrir aux enfants Asmat des médicaments contre la teigne, les maladies de la peau et les vitamines pour un éveil intellectuel amélioré 

Providing the Asmat with emergency drinkable water, since they have difficult access to sources of clean water. The water from the ground is hard to get because it's a swampy land, but, since the villages are close to the sea, we will be looking into installing a desalination system to offer them a permanent and safe source of clean potable water.//Fournir aux Asmat de l'eau potable d'urgence, car ils ont un accès difficile aux sources d'eau potable. L'eau du sol est difficile à obtenir parce que c'est une terre marécageuse, mais comme les villages sont près de la mer, nous allons envisager l'installation d'un système de dessalement pour leur offrir une source permanente et sûre d'eau potable propre. 

Offering the Asmat training in more efficient agriculture techniques, as a structural way of helping the tribe produce a constant stream of nutritious food.//Offrir à la Tribu des Asmat une formation sur des techniques agricoles plus efficaces, comme moyen structurel d'aider la tribu à produire un flux constant d'aliments nutritifs.

​

Building a new and proper school, with adequate areas of hygiene and food, so that the Asmat children enjoy a fully healthy environment and consolidate new habits while they are with us, during the day //Construire une école nouvelle et appropriée, avec des zones adéquates d'hygiène et de repas, afin que les enfants Asmat bénéficient d'un environnement entièrement sain et consolident de nouvelles habitudes pendant qu'ils sont avec nous, pendant la journée​. 

Providing the Asmat children with school uniforms and shoes that will help them be more comfortable and protected from the local environment’s harsh conditions (the land where they live)//Fournir aux enfants Asmat des uniformes scolaires et des chaussures qui les aideront à être plus à l'aise et à se protéger des conditions difficiles de l'environnement où ils vivent.

<p>Why we are here</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All throughout my teenage years and young adult life I have been an avid fan of football and regular exercise. However, sometimes I would hurt my foot because of twisting, and contortion during sports activities. </p>
<p>During early 2017, I decided to partner with a Japanese trade company to design a revolutionary new pair of socks that would minimize such instances of injury and protect the foot during exercise and with this campaign I intend to bring this new product to as many health enthusiast as possible to improve the quality of their exercise. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>About Spocker socks</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our innovative design incorporates all the best virtues you would like in a pair of socks.</p>
<p>Special fibres, interlaced and running along the side of the sock pulls the foot upwards laterally to keep it stable. The sock is specially designed to compress specific areas of the foot to improve blood flow hence removing lactic acid and excess water from the feet. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The cuff of the sock is very soft and made from special woolen fibers  to ensure no stretch marks appear on your leg after wearing them for many hours. In addition the fibers contain scented mint flavor to minimize smells that come from sweaty feet.  These keep the foot fresh so you do not feel embarrassed when removing your socks. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe Spocker socks will make a difference in the experiences of millions of people who love outdoor activities and sports. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The money raised from crowdfunding campaigns will go towards furthering our marketing efforts and  production of the initial batch of socks for distribution. </p>

<p>I was browsing through Instagram one day when I came across an ad about a hat company called dad hat apparel. I clicked on the ad and found a variety of unique and really cool hats. I wondered why I had never seen this company before and thought to myself ""what if all these unique early stage companies were marketed on one platform."" I then proceeded to purchase a hat but found that they only ship to America, something which KUIRQY will fix with its worldwide shipping option. </p>

<p>It was the process of reading time from a watch, both the classical two handed analogue and the digital display that had caught our interest - there had been no evolution in the display of time that simplified the reading of time – until now. Telling time from the classic two hand display needs to be decrypted from the positions of the hands, in contrast a digital display presents an answer. Our challenge was to display the time so that it does not require decryption but utilising a classic analogue movement.</p>
<p>The logical consequence was to use the 12 hour display, but the challenge was to display the minutes accurately with the classic sweep of the hour hand. The solution to this challenge is the core of SNGLRTY, by sending the minutes counter clockwise all the information for accurate time reading could be presented at a single location and assimilated in a single glance.</p>
<p>SNGLRTY, the long overdue next step in the evolution of the chronometer, was born. SNGLRTY reaches out to those who identify themselves as different from the crowd and embrace new technology and innovation. They cherish the precision of a Swiss watch, the desire to differentiate themselves from the crowd and to have a conversation as well as timepiece.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>The Swiss gentleman is Daniel Blunschi and has the passion of watches in his blood, as many Swiss do. He possesses over 30 years of experience working in the watch industry developing watches and presentation tools for some of the most famous watch brands in the world.</p>
<p>Stephen Mansfield, the Irishman, started out studying engineering and has spent 16 years living in Japan working for banks, a hedge fund and then managing hotels. He is now a serial entrepreneur focusing on projects that challenge and engage him and the world around us.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Steve on the left and Daniel on the right</p>
<h3>The Journey</h3>
<p>That moment in the bar was in early 2015, from there we spent time looking at the watch market and reviewing patents going back as far as the records went.  Our hunch was that our idea was unique so we christened our project “OHI” for one hand indication. There are many single handed watches on the market that oblige the wearer to guess the exact time but there was not a single handed watch that displayed the accurate time – until now. We had stumbled onto a simple concept in the field of watch making. Simple but never done before.</p> <p>SNGLRTY was the answer to the questions we had posed to ourselves that night. A single handed watch with a contra rotating minute disc designed to focus the eye on a single point where all the information is displayed. In short, a mechanical chronometer that can present the time accurately and be read efficiently with a single glance.</p>
<p>SNGLRTY is the only analogue timepiece capable presenting the time to the reader with the simplicity of the digital watch but the beauty and elegance of a traditional, accurate, mechanical chronometer.</p>
<p>We filed our patent application in October 2015 and started to develop the prototypes, Daniel knew that the only place in the world to develop and produce a watch with such technical challenges and the desired quality was the heart of the global watch industry – Switzerland.</p>
<p>It was not until the summer of 2017 that we finally managed to have 20 working prototypes - the Zero series was completed and almost concurrently on 15 August 2017 we were awarded US Patent 9,733,618 for a Timepiece With a Single Hand For Simultaneously Indicating Both Hours And Minutes.  Our hunch that this was a unique concept had been substantiated.</p>
<h3>This Campaign</h3>
<p>This campaign is the next step in the journey of SNGLRTY and we hope you will support us in this critical next step to make this evolution in watches available to everyone. Since that night almost 3 years ago in the bar we have felt obliged to ensure our innovation makes it to market, we have worked with some of the best watch engineers in the world but at each step it has been just the two of us taking each step to bring this innovation to fruition. As you can imagine we have spent a great deal of time (and money) to ensure that everything that is presented here can be offered with great confidence.  We both understand that each of our watches represents a material commitment for each of our backers, but you may rest assured as we have assembled 20 timepieces and each has been keeping the time accurately for over 6 months! When you select one of our beautiful Swiss Made watches you will receive a distinguished and unique piece protected by our US Patent.  </p>
<p>Through the development we have sought to keep our costs as low as possible, and we intend to continue that through the launch of SNGLRTY.  Using all of our knowledge we are able to offer a unique Swiss Made SNGLRTY watch for less than CHF1000, this is a remarkable price for a mechanical movement watch, but if you would like to have something more special and exclusive, that reflects your choices, then we have an offer to meet your desires.  As each watch will be hand assembled in Switzerland we are able to keep our threshold to launch very low – at US$40,000 – but we hope that we will raise this target many times over.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>SNGLRTY is an absolutely unique, highly recognizable product and working prototypes (some of which are available for purchase) are already in circulation. For the launch of SNGLRTY we want to deliver the highest quality at an affordable price, and the best way to do that is by delivering directly to our customers.</p>
<p>SNGLRTY is the only analogue timepiece capable presenting the time to the reader with the simplicity of the digital watch but the beauty and elegance of a traditional, accurate, mechanical chronometer.</p>
<p>For the launch of Series One we have developed three ranges of watches with the aim of satisfying as many different expectations as possible – but all featuring our patented One Hand Indication, individually numbered and a 2 year international warranty.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of  SNGLRTY we have created the OHI2 - Limited Edition. Pared back to the very essence of SNGLRTY, this wonderfully simple execution is based on the SELLITA SW200 movement and has a simplified face with no date indication.  There are 5 elements to this watch face 1) the hour index, 2) the minute index, 3) the central disc, 4) the second index and finally the hand itself.  Each backer who selects an OHI2 - Limited Edition will be able to select the colour of each of these elements, so there will be 32 combinations available.  We do not have all these combinations available for you to select from, but here are 3 variations so you can see the impact.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520007694/dkx9bmwsuh82etrfqcdt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Starting here with the ""All White"" - well with the exception of the second index for a bit of character.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520007800/mw5l9hzq4tsftbrora6b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Here we have mixed it up a bit with black hour index, white minute index, black centre disc, white second index and a white hand.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520007881/foebvmk6zpn3wukwhckh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And finally, for now, the black version where everything is black with the exception of the second index and the hand.  In this version we have indicated luminescence on the hour index and the hand. </p>
<p>For those looking for more individualism and more precision we have the SNGLRTY OHI3 and OHI4 ranges.  The only difference between the OHI3 and OHI4 ranges is the movement that is chosen, the OHI3 range uses the Sellita SW300 Elabore which and the OHI4 range uses the Sellita SW300 Premium Execution Fully Decorated, this is the most accurate movement and is decorated on the mass and the bridge of the movement.  For the full comparison of the differences in these movements you can go to our website <a href=""https://swissreimagined.com/snglrty-range/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520285861/d1jixojklo9glimamv0c.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The photograph above shows the Cote De Geneve decoration on the mass of the movement and the Pearlage decoration on the bridge of the movement. </p>
<p>Once you have selected which movement you would like the selection process is all about configuration of your watch face, there are six elements to the watch face and there are a number of options for each of the elements as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>The hour index is available in Galvanic Blue, Galvanic Black Gold, White &amp; Black.</li>
<li>The minute index is available in Galvanic Silver and Galvanic Black</li>
<li>The decor plate is available silver, black gold and blue - all with Cote de Geneve decoration</li>
<li>Second index is available in silver and black gold</li>
<li>The date index is available in silver and black</li>
<li>Finally, the hand is available in Black and Silver</li>
</ol>
<p>This gives a total number of 192 combinations - so it is quite likely that you will have a very unique piece when you make the selections.  You will be able to look through the gallery of photos we have here and see all these individual pieces in the photos, but for everyone who selects to support us with the OHI3 or OHI4 execution we will contact you when the campaign period is over and work with you to select your combination. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520287185/mijyeh7zpn2ccc63pdva.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The above shows black hour index, white date index, white minute index, silver decor plate with Cote de Geneve, silver second index and black hand.  We also show a black saffiano leather watch band. </p>
<p>And, if that is not enough, for those who would wish to create your own watch based around the patented SNGLRTY display we have a special option to design your own watch.  You will have a personal meeting with our renowned Swiss watch designer who will create a design for your own watch and we will have it produced and assembled for you. There are some limitations on this one (for example addition of precious metals or stones will have to be charged in addition after the design is complete) please ask us if you are interested, but you can see more details <a href=""https://swissreimagined.com/bespoke_execution/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>.</p>

If you have made it this far you clearly like what we are doing, but perhaps it is not what you are looking for - that is OK we understand not everyone likes Swiss made mechanical watches.  But if you like what we are about then please do not hesitate to share the word through social media and the Indigogo share tools just #SNGLRTYWATCH.  We love you for reading to the end!",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Vanilla Project</strong></h2>
<p>You deserve much more than just smelling good. You deserve to feel uniquely you. Wearing an eco-responsible fragrance, made with heart and art.</p>
<p><strong>Regain the artist in you and support an ethical perfume creation!</strong></p>
<p>By helping me creating this Vanilla centered perfume, you are not only supporting a small indie French Perfume Brand, but you are also caring for the earth and investing in an ethically produced fragrance, MADE IN PROVENCE, by an independent perfume designer.</p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Anatole Lebreton. In the heart of green Provence, I create unique fragrances that reflect my journey off the beaten track, from amateur to self-taught perfumer. In complete freedom, by mastering the creative process from A to Z, I’m committed to sharing my passion for beautiful smell with passionate people through original, artisanal and audacious fragrances.</p>
<p>The Vanilla Project is a new and innovative perfume development where the accent will be made on sourcing beautiful sustainable, renewable raw materials (vanilla essence, sandalwood amongst others). The final product will be presented in a recycled kraft paper box. And for each bottle sold, a donation will be made for the <a href=""https://onetreeplanted.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One tree planted</a> program.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need:</h3>
<p>The total cost of this perfume development and production is 12100 €. I'm bringing 4900 € from my personal funds. Then, I need your help. 7200 € on a flexible goal is what I need to continue to work on this exciting project. If we reach the goal: fantastic! If we exceed the set goal: all the money will go into increasing production. </p>
<p>Raising the necessary 7200€ would support the creation and production of The Vanilla Project, from the trials, regulation tests, to buying the raw materials, including boxes and bottles and producing the full bottles of perfume.</p>
<h3>Why I need it:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Creating the formula, conducting trials = that’s my favorite part and it’s already started. It’s a passion, but it also costs a bit of money.</li>
<li>Producing the eco-boxes. I have the prototype, now it needs to be sent to production for 1500 recycle kraft paper boxes. </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583745693/gawsp25s1nxfocnyxsjd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Buying the necessary empty bottles + caps</li>
<li>Sourcing sustainable materials (vanilla, sandalwood amongst others) = it takes a bit of research, testing the quality of the materials and checking their provenance.</li>
<li>Buying raw materials. Great raw materials like pure vanilla can be VERY expensive. (To give you an idea: 100g of pure vanilla absolute costs around 1000 €) </li>
<li>Conducting security tests: regulations compliance, patch test, toxicology... = boring and very expensive too - around 2500 € - but compulsory. Your safety is important and this has to be conducted before putting the fragrance on the market.</li>
<li>Producing the fragrance (mixing the ingredients, maceration, putting into alcohol and labeling).  That's the moment the dream becomes real. </li>
<li>And finally: marketing, creating the story and the advertising supports.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's a lot of work... and I'm totally involved in all the steps with my working partners to check that it all goes well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>With any cent you donate, you’ll get my endless gratitude, a smile on my face and on all the people involved to make sure this project will see the light.</p>
<p>And you can get many different gifts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support 5 to 20 €, and you'll get a sample of the final scent.</li>
<li>Receive samples of raw materials + of the final scent for 40€</li>
<li>Meet the perfumer (Paris, Nice, Grasse,  Milan, Los Angeles) for 70€</li>
<li>Pre-sell: receive a bottle of the final product valued 120 €  for 95 €</li>
<li>Receive a bottle of the final product and samples of the raw materials 135 €</li>
<li>Join the focus group: 275 € (and help to choose the final scent, the name and work on the story + you’ll receive the final product with a special dedication)</li>
<li>Sponsor- your name will be added to the marketing media as a sponsor, and of course, you'll get a bottle:  500 €</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Schedule: </h3>
<p>March - April 2020 - Crowdfunding- production of the boxes</p>
<p>April - May 2020 - work on the formula with the focus group - selecting raw materials - buying bottles. </p>
<p>June 2020 - start of the testing process, regulation compliance</p>
<p>July 2020 - start the production of the fragrance</p>
<p>September 2020 - official launch. </p>
<h3>The impact:</h3>
<p>Innovation: My last fragrance was created with a focus group of perfume lovers that have become active witnesses to the development of the upcoming fragrance. This new project makes a step forward in innovation by integrating ethical sourcing and being socially responsible.</p>
<p><strong>We are caring for the earth and we want to make sure that our beauty products are also keeping the beauty of this planet we’re walking on.</strong></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges:</h3>
<p>Small brands like mine often have few means and need financial support to shape their dreams.  I’ve learned over the years, that it’s not enough to be a great artist and have the guts to realize your most crazy ideas. It takes also some skills to grow a successful business.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s not enough to just build a business if it has no soul and heart, if it’s not contributing to the greater good. The new generation of entrepreneur wants also to create a better world.</p>
<p>I’m challenging myself and my company with this new project. And I make a bet that it will be successful, for me, for you -you’ll get a beautiful perfume and I hope you will love it- and for the earth. <strong>We are all partners to make the world a better place to live, that smell awesome.</strong></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know, you maybe can’t afford to donate money, even for a cause you support. There are other ways to help! By spreading the word is one, and I’m truly grateful if you do so.</p>

<p>Several years ago I went to a podiatrist to get a pair of orthotic insoles. He took a mold of my feet, sent them to a lab and $700 later I got the most uncomfortable pieces of plastic that I could hardly keep in my shoes.</p>
<p>In truth, although I was frustrated by my new purchase, it was a great day in my life because it got me started on the research that led me to the creation of ""Dynamic Customization"". I asked myself why the insoles had to be hard, why must one sacrifice comfort for the sake of support. I asked many questions of podiatrists, biomechanic engineers, shoe designers and many people who wore shoe inserts.</p>
<p>It was clear that other than the small percentage of people who need their insoles to compensate for more complex issues, hundreds of millions of people just need some extra arch support and additional comfort.</p>

<p>After seven years of hard work, testing and more research on the biomechanics of the foot, and development of the proper material, me and my development team of some of the world top footwear designers, helped bring my dream into reality. I had reached our goal, ""Dynamic Customization"".</p>

</div><div> </div></div>","Introducing a MAJOR breakthrough in footwear technology.

Edensoles, Dynamic Customization continuously shapes to the contour of your feet from step to step while providing the perfect level of arch support

We spend much of the day on our feet. 

As a result of not having the proper footwear, most people hardly perform up to a fraction of their potential due to foot pain, back pain and fatigue.

Tired of suffering from foot pain day after day?
Edensoles shape to the contour of your feet STEP-AFTER-STEP, adapting to the changing demands of a tiring day from morning to evening.
 

After years of development, we are excited to introduce Edensoles to the Kickstarter community first!
The bottom layer is made of soft, yet stable polyurethane for comfort and flexibility. The middle layer contains cavities filled with a specialized polymer made to shape to your arch and toes upon body weight and changing pressure. The top layer is made of slow release, anti-sweat foam covered by anti-slip, breathable fabric.
 
 
Great for casual, sport and formal shoes!

Our two styles will provide superior support and comfort for men and women whether you are working out or heading to a business meeting.

 

 

 

For more formal shoes that tend to have less room, we have a thinner version using EVA as the bottom material.

 

The insoles contain two pockets under the arch and toes filled with a moldable polymer that immediately shapes perfectly to your feet.
The polymer is formulated to provide a fine balance of strong support with flexible comfort.

 
WAIT ONE MINUTE!
Don't confuse our product with old technology.
Dynamic Customization is unlike memory foam, foot molds, heating customization, feet scanning machines or other static devices.

It shapes to your feet and does not bounce back to its original shape or just remain static. Rather it continuously shapes perfectly to the contour of the user's feet.

Several years ago I went to a podiatrist to get a pair of orthotic insoles. He took a mold of my feet, sent them to a lab and $700 later I got the most uncomfortable pieces of plastic that I could hardly keep in my shoes.
In truth, although I was frustrated by my new purchase, it was a great day in my life because it got me started on the research that led me to the creation of ""Dynamic Customization"". I asked myself why the insoles had to be hard, why must one sacrifice comfort for the sake of support. I asked many questions of podiatrists, biomechanic engineers, shoe designers and many people who wore shoe inserts.
It was clear that other than the small percentage of people who need their insoles to compensate for more complex issues, hundreds of millions of people just need some extra arch support and additional comfort.

 
After seven years of hard work, testing and more research on the biomechanics of the foot, and development of the proper material, me and my development team of some of the world top footwear designers, helped bring my dream into reality. I had reached our goal, ""Dynamic Customization"".


 


 


Unbelievable comfort, total support, constantly changing throughout the day and a specially customized toe grip to help provide extra stability and grip to spring forward when running.

<p>Thanks to Dash, I set out to create a new, minimal wallet, and the Dash Travel Wallet is product of all our previous wallets. </p>

</div>","When we set out to make the Dash Travel Wallet, we noticed that there weren’t many travel wallets on the market. The travel wallets that we did find were either too bulky, or too expensive, and most people, including me, were just carrying their passport unprotected.














LOSS PREVENTION
Ask any seasoned traveler what their biggest fear when traveling is, and they’ll all tell you the same thing - losing a passport.






Carrying a passport by itself is ill-advised. It could easily be misplaced when fumbling for your boarding pass, ID, credit card, or money. Our RFID protection will prevent identity theft while in busy airports.






Employees at SFO state that this happens all the time, almost everyday.
We wanted to make a wallet perfect for travel, in the most minimal and simplest form.






A wallet that could hold, not only cash and cards, but your passport, and boarding pass as well. And allow easy access to all of it. 






Starting at just $18, the Dash Travel Wallet is not only the most minimal option, but the most economical on the internet.






Designed for you, the international traveler, who knows no boundaries, and is always on the go.



FITS IN FRONT POCKETS



The Dash Travel Wallet is a modern spin on a timeless essential. Do you really want to carry your travel necessities in one of your grandma's old fanny packs?






Of course not. 
Next thing you know, you’ll be wearing sandals with socks too.  






Whether you’re flying into New York City for a business meeting, or flying to Bali in search of yourself, the Dash Travel Wallet is perfect for you. Stylish enough for any gentleman, or gentlewoman, traveling for business, but rugged enough to tackle any adventure you throw at it. 






Don’t waste time stumbling through security. With the Dash Travel Wallet, everything you need to get past the security line is in the palm of your hand. Passport, boarding pass, and everything in between, all in one simple, and quick, travel wallet.






No need to open any zippers, or dig through any bags, just one swift motion, and you’re through. 
Exceptionally slim, Dash Travel Wallet is the perfect size for any destination. With pockets designed to hold your passport, ID’s, credit cards, and boarding pass, this is the last travel wallet you will ever need. 






The ultra-thin profile will allow comfortable wear with suits or jeans - casual or formal attire.






Unsatisfied with other bulky travel wallets, we set out to make the most minimal, functional travel wallet there is. It is constructed from one-piece of canvas that is folded, sewn, and cut strategically to minimize the size.






The Dash Travel Wallet comes with two side slots to carry cards, one slide slot to carry a boarding pass, and one main slot to carry your passport.






No extra fluff, no unnecessary features, lower the risk of losing any essential items - passport, credit card, ID -  when traveling abroad. 

WHY THE DASH TRAVEL WALLET?

Simply put, it’s the best travel wallet available. Too often we see travelers losing their passport, or their ID, or their credit card, completely ruining an otherwise perfect vacation. No one should have to worry about these things when traveling.






With the Dash Travel Wallet you can fully enjoy the wonderful experience traveling brings, with the peace of mind that your most important documents are safe and secure.





Minimal, stylish, sleek, and functional, we are confident this little wallet will be your most revered travel companion for years to come. 






We asked our manufacturing partners what materials would have the durability to endure our journeys, but also feel so good that we would want to bring them everywhere. They suggested a premium, eco-synthetic leather - the same used in many luxury vehicles, complying with universal stewardship standards across the board. 



SUPER SOFT ECO-LEATHER



We are certain you’ll love the feeling of the super soft, supple canvas on your hand, in your pocket, around the globe. On top of quality, our leather also offers weather resistant protection, ensuring your valuables stay dry wherever the winds may take you.






The minimal simplicity allows for durability by design. In addition, the hand sewn threading and wax oiled edges protect the wallet from fraying from wear and tear.
RFID PROTECTION
We won't bore you with all the details/benefits of why RFID protection is important, but just know the Dash Travel Wallet will protect both your cards and passport from any identity or credit card theft.
OUR PARTNERS
We’ve been producing wallets for three years now, and have made strong relationships with reputable manufacturers that will bring to you the highest quality materials available. 






OPTIONS
We will be offering two styles of the Dash Travel Wallet, a pebble leather finish, and a classic leather finish. Choose whichever style suits you best, (or both) and set out to see the world. 






INSPIRATION
We were inspired by the Dash 3.0, when designing the Dash Travel Wallet. We thought the minimalism that the 3.0 brought would be the perfect base for a travel wallet. 






We took the best that the 3.0 had to offer, and added the necessary features for full fledged travel wallet.





 
It turned out to be a match made in heaven.
