<h1><b>Hey Everyone!<br/></b></h1>
<p>My name is Mark Baker, I am a professional cook who grew up in Toronto but has adopted Hamilton as my home town.  I love this city and the diverse and eclectic food offerings we have to offer.  I'd like to have the opportunity to join them and help my city grow even MORE!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In a nutshell, I'd like to open a takeout restaurant where I can serve customers, awesome and delicious, healthy comfort foods and favorites and at the same time have fun showing off my creative side and making you smile.  Ever heard of a Grilled PB and J? How bout a Cheeseburgerdilla? Yup(I know right?)...I have and they're AWESOME! You can get them from me at MERK if you help me get there.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I love making good food for people.  The best part of my day is when I'm chatting with customers and they say ""Remember that time you made me a *insert food item here*?..."" and that look of lingering ""YUM!"" comes over their face.  Even when I watch kids eat something as simple as my fresh cut fries and their faces light up!  That is what I want to do everyday, for every customer that comes into my place.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Career Highlights:</b></p>
<p>-Worked under Hamilton's Chef of the Year 2008 Michael Campanaro at The Old Powerhouse <br/></p>
<p>-Worked at Rattlesnake Point Golf course under Chefs Kevin Watson and Winston Lewis, Winners of the Roxul Culinary Challenge <br/></p>
<p>-Played a key role in opening Memphis Fire Barbeque Company Winona, Ontario <br/></p>
<p>-Created the signature desert at Sharkey's World Grill in Oakville, Ontario</p>
<p>-Introduced new menu items at The Phoenix at MacMaster University <br/></p>
<p>-Planned and implemented 3 menus for Topshelf Sports bar and Crossbar and Grill <br/>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have been cooking since I was 14 years old, and have always been attached to this industry to some degree.  I have worked with and for many notable and awarded Chefs in Hamilton and Halton Region.  I currently run 2 successful sports bars in Burlington, and I am ready to have my OWN place!</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The reason I am doing this crowd fund campaign is two fold. 1. To acquire a location as well as purchase the equipment necessary to launch my business.   I will need to get new signs installed and renovation work to the interior.<br/>2. Acquiring loans for a restaurant is VERY difficult and there are very few opportunities if any for small business grants for restaurant start-up.  <br/>
</div>
<div>
<div><b>***UPDATE**Your contributions will help me in the following ways:</b></div>
<div>[ ] $2000/initial payment for the location King street and Hilda avenue </div>
<div>[ ] $12000 installation of venting equipment</div>
<div>[ ] $10000 purchase of major kitchen equipment</div>
<div>[ ] $1200 Purchase of kitchen smallwares and Initial raw product</div>
<div>[ ] $5000 renovations</div>
<div>[ ] $2700 licensing and inspection</div>
</div>
<div><br/></div>What I need from you folks would be some help building capital.    In order to accomplish this I would need a boost!<br/><br/>In exchange for your contributions I would offer the following:<br/><br/>$20 Thank you for your help! <br/><br/>$50 <b>All contributions over $50 get you 10% back in MERK gift cards</b>
<br/>
</div>$100 I will shout you out in a Video made specially for you!+ 10% off to MERK<br/><div>
<br/>$200 I will give you a T shirt or Baseball hat with MERK logos! Everyone likes SWAG right?!<br/>
</div>
<div>
$500 I will name an item on my menu in your honor! I'll even let you choose which one!<br/><br/>$1000 I will host a cooking class for you and 3 friends in your house!<br/>
</div>
<div>
+$1000 I will have you to MERK before I open the door for a special Menu Sampling! As well I will give you your first 3 Meals FREE when you come in</div>
<div>
<br/><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I intend to buy local first! That means all of my produce, meat, dry goods and paper products will first be sourced right here in Hamilton before I look elsewhere.  Supporting local businesses in the city will help us all.  </div>
<div>
<br/>The intended location for MERK is in an area called the Sherman Hub.  The central part of Hamilton's up and coming Ward 3 community which also houses Tim Horton's Field, home of the Hamilton Tiger Cats!  This area is very under served in the regard that there are  few restaurants in the area, and even fewer that offer fresh, healthy and affordable food choices for take out.  MERK will meet that need!</div>
<div>
<br/>The 2015 Pan Am Games will also be in Hamilton THIS SUMMER! With all Soccer Matches played at Tim Horton's Field.  MERK is within reach  of Tim Horton's field and will be able to capitalize on the increased foot traffic brought by this event.</div>
<div>
<br/>Scott Park, Jimmy Thompson Pool and the proposed Mega High School for Hamilton are all within reach of MERK.  In the summer, Scott Park has baseball leagues.  I intend to sponsor a team and get my name out there even more.  Lets not forget the TI-CATS tailgating during Football season!</div>
<br/>I love this city! Living here I also know all too well the social challenges faced everyday by the residents.  Hamilton has MANY outreach programs and I plan to give back to the community as much as possible.  I plan to donate a percentage of my profit directly to charities such as Living Rock Youth Ministries and the James Street Mission.</div>
<div>
<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>A restaurant is a challenge that is for sure! I have had several years managing kitchens as well as my own personal catering business.  I have excellent knowledge of food costing, cost management, sales trend analysis, money management and customer service.  I will do whatever it takes to make customers happy, while keeping my business operating happily.  <br/><br/>I have been on the front lines for a long time and see how difficult it can be to run a restaurant..I do not believe in a HANDS OFF type of business management. How can you know how your customers feel about what you are offering if you are not engaged with them constantly?  I am ready and able, I just need your help to get there!</div>

<p>In 2001 Lucie Carle, Founder of Ntegrity<sup>TM</sup>,  was faced with severe skin allergies and she suffered from eczema on her eyelids. It had reached a point where she could not put any make-up products on her face. After years of research and her discovery of the chemicals used in conventional cosmetic products, she made it her mission to create a healthy and effective line of skin care solutions. Her dream is that one day, her line will be available to all. She left her full-time employment as a mediator to dedicate her time to the cause for safe cosmetics and after 11 years of research and testing, she needs your support to make her line of products more accessible. </p>
<p>She created a line of plant-based cosmetics, called Phytocosmetics™, that is patent pending and that was nominated for two awards [Manning Award associated with the National Research Council of Canada and the Centre québécois de valorisation des
biotechnologies (CQVB)]. </p>
<p>Lucie and her team will be moving to a new laboratory that will include, proper air ventilation, machinery and space that her current manufacturing location could not offer. Your contributions will help her finance part of the equipment cost needed to produce her skin care line. This will also allow the products to be distributed as a next phase in the two largest provinces in Canada: Quebec and Ontario.<br/></p>
</div><h3>Your Contributions and Our Gift to You </h3><p></p><p>We are currently trying to raise 4000$ to purchase a label machine, a specialized mixer for oils and a pressing machine for powders all needed for manufacturing.</p><p>In exchange for your generosity and to express our appreciation, we have included 4 unique perks you can choose from: a lip melt gloss made of moringa oil, three types of eyeshadow kits depending on your eye color.</p><p>If we do not reach our goal, the amount raised will still be put towards furnishing the new lab. </p><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p>In 2010, a study showed that 1 out of 2 individuals suffered from contact allergies or skin sensitivity due to the exposure of questionable chemical substances on the market. Furthermore, according to a study done by Stacky Malkin in 2008, author of the book “<i>Not just a pretty face: the side effects of cosmetic chemicals</i>”,
women on average, use 12 products per day, which exposes them to 168 chemical ingredients.</p><p>Unfortunately, these are not just statistics: it is a sad reality for far too many people and the effect that chemicals can have on the skin are sometimes  irreversible. </p><p>Ntegrity™ has built a loyal base of customers that have not just purchased products but have learnt to read labels, identify their individual skin type needs and the appropriate use of products. We believe that through education and a better understanding of your skin, you will feel empowered to make better choices for yourself and the environment.</p><ul> </ul><div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>One challenge that our project faces is the amount of
competition that currently exists in the cosmetic industry. Consumers are often
being misled on the properties and the results associated with conventional
products. We believe that through educational workshops, through innovation, transparency,
consumers will feel empowered to make better choices for their skin and health.
</p>
<p>Another challenge we are facing is finalizing the business
plan for our next stage of production and for the markets we have targeted. We

</div>","The Ntegrity™ Project - A Cause for Safe Cosmetics 
In 2001 Lucie Carle, Founder of NtegrityTM,  was faced with severe skin allergies and she suffered from eczema on her eyelids. It had reached a point where she could not put any make-up products on her face. After years of research and her discovery of the chemicals used in conventional cosmetic products, she made it her mission to create a healthy and effective line of skin care solutions. Her dream is that one day, her line will be available to all. She left her full-time employment as a mediator to dedicate her time to the cause for safe cosmetics and after 11 years of research and testing, she needs your support to make her line of products more accessible. 
She created a line of plant-based cosmetics, called Phytocosmetics™, that is patent pending and that was nominated for two awards [Manning Award associated with the National Research Council of Canada and the Centre québécois de valorisation des
biotechnologies (CQVB)]. 
Lucie and her team will be moving to a new laboratory that will include, proper air ventilation, machinery and space that her current manufacturing location could not offer. Your contributions will help her finance part of the equipment cost needed to produce her skin care line. This will also allow the products to be distributed as a next phase in the two largest provinces in Canada: Quebec and Ontario.
Your Contributions and Our Gift to You We are currently trying to raise 4000$ to purchase a label machine, a specialized mixer for oils and a pressing machine for powders all needed for manufacturing.In exchange for your generosity and to express our appreciation, we have included 4 unique perks you can choose from: a lip melt gloss made of moringa oil, three types of eyeshadow kits depending on your eye color.If we do not reach our goal, the amount raised will still be put towards furnishing the new lab. The Impact In 2010, a study showed that 1 out of 2 individuals suffered from contact allergies or skin sensitivity due to the exposure of questionable chemical substances on the market. Furthermore, according to a study done by Stacky Malkin in 2008, author of the book “Not just a pretty face: the side effects of cosmetic chemicals”,
women on average, use 12 products per day, which exposes them to 168 chemical ingredients.Unfortunately, these are not just statistics: it is a sad reality for far too many people and the effect that chemicals can have on the skin are sometimes  irreversible. Ntegrity™ has built a loyal base of customers that have not just purchased products but have learnt to read labels, identify their individual skin type needs and the appropriate use of products. We believe that through education and a better understanding of your skin, you will feel empowered to make better choices for yourself and the environment.    Risks & Challenges 

One challenge that our project faces is the amount of
competition that currently exists in the cosmetic industry. Consumers are often
being misled on the properties and the results associated with conventional
products. We believe that through educational workshops, through innovation, transparency,
consumers will feel empowered to make better choices for their skin and health.

Another challenge we are facing is finalizing the business
plan for our next stage of production and for the markets we have targeted. We
are currently working with a team of coaches to help us identify next steps as
we plan our transition to our new lab. We are exploring potential partnerships
to widen our network in Quebec and Ontario.

<p><b>Q:</b>
What is the #TallChefTallOrder Crowdfunding campaign?</p>
<p><b>A:</b>
Our goal is to raise the funds needed to stay and continue to contribute to the
community of Erin.  </p>
<p>We want to continue serving freshly prepared foods using
only high quality ingredients.  We want to serve delicious brunch and lunch, or
cater it to go.  We want to serve you coffee, and help the community &amp; our
kids eat well at Barbour Fields and our Community Centre 2000.  We want to have you in for
cooking classes and we want to be the center to build a food community on Main Street.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why are you crowdfunding?</p>
<p><b>A:</b>
If we go to the bank we aren’t taken seriously as a small start up business and
if we choose to look to investors, we would lose our autonomy.  We want to ensure we remain 100% committed to
our goal of providing fresh, local, high quality food to our community
customers.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b>
Why now?</p>
<p><b>A:</b>
There is exciting change coming to Erin and we want to be part of that.  In order to remain here, buying the building
and buying it now is key.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b>
How can I donate?</p>
<p><b>A:</b>
Donations can be made online at thefriendlychef.ca or in-store.  We are offering up so many amazing rewards
for donations, everything from free coffee to an exclusive event in PEI with
Chef Michael Smith.  Come in and ask us
more or visit thefriendlychef.ca</p>
<p><b>Q:</b>
What else is happening?</p>
<p><b>A:</b>
We’ve got a great silent auction with a host wonderful items donated by valued
customers, community residents, Chef Michael Smith, ourselves at The Friendly
Chef Adventures, local artists and more! Come into the store to see more or
visit thefriendlychef.ca.  We’re also
hosting a community barbecue on Sunday, September 13<sup>th</sup> and hope to
see you there!</p>
<p><b>Q:</b>
What if I have more questions?</p>
<p><b>A:</b>
Come on in or simply give us a call! Our door is always open to our community
members and we look forward to speaking with you.</p>
<b>Q:</b>  What has been happening so far in week 1 of your campaign? <br/><br/><p><b>A: </b>  We've had an incredible response from all across Canada.  Already celebrity Chefs like Chef Michael Smith and others
have donated either items in the silent auction fundraiser or made financial contributions.  “I’m in awe of Chef Pam, she
is a true hero and I’m proud to call her my friend,” said Chef Michael
Smith.  “She understands the role that an
inspiring, locally grounded restaurant can play in revitalizing and anchoring a
community and I wish her all the best. I can’t wait to help cut the
ribbon!"" </p>
<p>Town of Erin Mayor Al Alls has also proudly jumped behind my campaign.  “I have known Pam and
her team since coming to Erin and she provides an excellent value to our Main
Street with her food and friendly atmosphere,” said Mayor Alls. “Pam and
team are the entrepreneurship Erin needs going forward in growing our
Town.”  With the latest Economic
Development Plan ready for Erin Council’s review, Chef Pam wants to be a
driving force on Main Street in collaboration with other enthusiastic business
owners to revive the downtown core.  </p>
<p>Between online and in store donations, including those from our silent 
auction bids and those who have committed to prepay for catering 
services we have raised $9,971.00</p>
<p>Q:  What is next?  <br/></p>
<p>A:  We really need your support and online or in store contributions in the week ahead.   We need others across Canada and internationally to notice what we are trying to give back to our community by staying here and securing our future by buying this heritage building and your help to spread the word far and wide is critical.  <br/></p>
<p>Essentially we are asking folks to simply prepay for services, gift cards, food, catering and classes that they already know they will be wanting to purchase from us so that we can raise the down payment for our building this month and make this reality happen.  For those  who don't know us or live afar you can contribute to our community's health and well being by simply making a donation.      <br/></p>

<p><b><u>The Story</u></b></p>
<p>The minstrels played like fiends and the ale was doing its job. Every guest and member of the court ate and laughed and danced in the Great Keep at Havenwood. Tonight must be for merriment for tomorrow we ride for glory... But before I presided over the Court at Havenwood, I was a simple Smithy's son. This is the story of Havenwood:</p>

<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>What we need:</b><br/><ul>
<li>$1000 is the immediate target to cover the costs of launching the campaign (graphic designer, composer, and the pins and rings).</li>
<li>The funds we receive will go to selecting and buying an appropriate property which must include a water source (rivers, lakes and dams), a forested area for trail rides, LARP adventures and quests, open areas with rich soil for livestock, and enough space to build the village and castle. We will be using the natural resources on the property like timber and stone to keep the costs down and also will be using the team at Havenwood to build as much as possible ourselves to reduce cost but we will still need to buy quarried stone and employ labourers to ensure Havenwood is built within a reasonable time frame and to the highest possible standard. </li>
<li>If we don't get all the funds required then Havenwood will still be made but on a  smaller scale with fewer features. It will still be an agrarian medieval farm stay accommodation with activities and opportunities to LARP .</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div><b><u><br/></u></b></div>
<div><b><u>Stretch Targets</u></b></div>
<div><b>600,000 USD - Rustic Medieval Village</b></div>
<div>At this point we'd have enough to build a solid but rustic village which would include: a Great Hall (for meals and ceremonies as well as feasts and balls) a Stable, an Arena (for LARP tournaments) the farm (livestock, orchard, herb garden and greenhouse) and a dedicated LARP battlefield and LARP campsite as well as the swords, bows, arrows, horses, saddles, tack and other necessities. </div>
<div><b>800,000 USD - Established Medieval Village</b></div>
<div>We can add the Alehouse and the Inn so we can serve mead and ale and a second LARP battlefield as well as a dedicated archery range and drill ground. </div>
<div><b>1,000,000 USD - Medieval Town</b></div>
<div>We'll add a bake house and smoke house to serve higher quality meals, prepared fresh on sight as well as a fortified wall to surround the town. </div>
<div><b>1,250,000 USD - Established Medieval Town</b></div>
<div>We'll add the Blacksmiths (a working forge and workshop) a Chandlery with bee hives and a market place with a fountain depicting the Havenwood gods. </div>
<div><b>1,500,000 USD - Medieval City </b></div>
<div>We can build a village outside the City for cottage accommodation for both our guests and staff and we'll add the mercenary camp. </div>
<div><b>1,750,000 USD - City additions</b></div>
<div><span>We can build The Armoury and The Mages and Warriors Guild.</span></div>
<div><b>2,000,000 USD - Training additions</b></div>
<div>We can build the Tree top course; a high ropes obstacle course in the forest for Ranger training and we can start building some of the quest sites, like troll caves etc...</div>
<div><b>2,500,000 USD - City urpgrades</b></div>
<div>We can add a games hall to play D &amp; D, as well as a Gallows, pecking cages, a Cooper, lumber mill and wood workshop, chapels, shrines, cobbled roads, carriages, a wedding site, bandit camp,  a well, Amphitheatre, Healer's hut, bell tower, signal fire, the steam rooms and hot baths and the dragon bone chandelier. </div>
<div><b>3,000,000 USD - Great Hall upgrade</b></div>
<div>We can upgrade the Great Hall to a stone keep with secret passageways and castle-stay accommodation. </div>
<div><b>6,000,000 USD+ - Havenwood Keep upgrade</b></div>
<div>We can upgrade the Stone keep to a large stone castle! And add a gate house, portcullis and drawbridge. </div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<p><b><u>The Impact</u></b></p>
<p>We want Havenwood to also be be a dedicated LARP hub for festivals and games. Even week long campaigns. We aim to hold a variety of festivals and forgotten trade fairs, Renaissance fairs, a Yule ball, jousting tournaments and celebrate the equinoxes. </p>
<p>It is our aim at Havenwood to to bring people an ""immersive tourism"" experience and push what we're calling the Medieval Movement. </p>
<p><b>Immersive Tourism</b> - Immersive Tourism is almost like interactive theatre. It's a holiday experience that completely immerses the client into a world or experience much like a living RPG. In terms of the Havenwood experience it's like extreme D &amp; D or LARP on the next level. I have worked for <i>In Real Life Shooter </i>which was an attempt at making a real life first person shooter with zombies. It was quite successful but very expensive for a two hour experience. We want to take an immersive experience to the next level and create a world that you can live in.</p>
<p><b>The Medieval Movement</b> - The Medieval Movement is an attempt to bring people back to basics. Getting people to work together and relearn how to communicate without the modern technology we currently rely on. It's about eating fresh produce, sleeping better, getting out in the fresh and really relying on working together and cooperating. We currently must work almost twice as many days in the year to earn enough to house and feed ourselves than the average medieval peasant. We aim to teach people how easy it is to grow fresh produce and herbs at home, saving you money and keeping you healthy as well as home remedies for simple ailments, like headaches etc. </p>

<p><b><u>The Small Council</u></b></p>
<div><b>Lord Torin Vane, first of his name, Lord of Havenwood, Keeper of the Forest and Protector of the Realms of men – </b></div>
<div>Torin was a simple smithy's son who lived in a quiet hamlet on the edge of the Kingswood. Forsaking his father's trade, he learned the ways of the wilderness from his childhood friends, the Elves. Having had adventure thrust upon him, his many travels to root out the court magisters led him on a journey to the dragon ranges. Aided by loyal friends along the way who would end up serving as his Small Council, he is both terrified and excited at the prospect of living up to his new title and constructing the new Fief of Havenwood. He hopes all in the Kingdom will act upon their guest right and seek out Havenwood Village.</div>
<div>
<b>Adrick ‘Fargrim’ Ironfist (Master of Coin) –</b><br/>
</div>
<div><div>Adrick Fargrim or ‘Grim’ to Lord Vane, was branded ‘Ironfist’ by the Guild of Merchants, so reluctant to part with coin was he. Knowing how that name could cripple his business interests he quickly cultivated a reputation as a bad tempered bar room brawler. A sour deal with a Dwarven smith led to the fingerless gauntlet that he is seldom seen without. He currently resides as Master of Coin, protecting the financial interests of Havenwood’s coffers in the traditional blacks and midnight blues that befit his station.</div></div>
<div>
<b>Ylva Jorrun (Havenwood Huntswoman and Stable Master)-</b><br/>
</div>
<div>
<div>Ylva was born into the austere life of the Raider Clan. Showing sufficient discipline and skill, Ylva was accepted to the trials as a child but lacking the blood lust expected of the clan’s warriors, she was assigned the less honourable position of beast keeper. Among the horses, however, she finally felt at home.</div>
<div>Ylva was sent by her master to see to the animals when the High Clansman, out of pride and greed, lead his warriors to raid the fabled Elven wood, where the elves were said to hold treasures greater than man could imagine.  He led his warriors to their demise.</div>
<div>When all her clansmen had perished or fled Ylva was found by the elves injured and unconscious but encircled by the horses she cared for. They had not fled the battle but remained protectively with her. This intrigued the elves and they took her in and cared for her as she recovered. </div>
<div>Ylva remained with the elves as she grew until it was seen that she must journey on. As emissary of the elves she was sent to seek out Torin Vane and aid him in his new role as Lord of Havenwood as the Lord’s protector and Huntswoman.</div>
</div>

Have you ever wanted to live the life of a medieval adventurer? Lean to fire a bow, wield a sword and ride through the forest with your companions to the feast that awaits you at the castle! Heed the call... Accept the Quest. Swords and sorcery await you at Havenwood. 


 


Havenwood is a completely immersive medieval experience with short and long term accommodation and medieval classes, activities and quests! We are building a medieval city, which will come alive with your help. As a citizen of Havenwood we will train you to fight, ride and shoot to prepare you for the battles ahead. LARP, quest and train in a bustling fantasy world where you decide who you are, and what you'll be. Heed the call, ride for glory. 



Activities
Ride! Saddle up your horse and take to the forest paths as you learn about horsemanship and how to sit your jousting saddle!

Fight! Draw your sword as you learn medieval swordsmanship techniques and learn to use a variety of medieval weapons!

Shoot! Make your longbow sing as we teach you traditional instinctive archery!
Battle! Take up arms as you battle for supremacy on one of the LARP battlefields or enter the Arena and take on your friends for all to see!
Explore! Take in the sights as take on the tree top high ropes course!
Feast! Come back to the Great Hall after a day's adventure to enjoy a traditional medieval feast from meat and produce grown in our fields!
Brew! Learn the Brewers craft at the Alehouse and sample some tradiontional ales and mead!
Craft! Learn to sew cloaks and make candles and keep the fruits of your labor!




The Story
The minstrels played like fiends and the ale was doing its job. Every guest and member of the court ate and laughed and danced in the Great Keep at Havenwood. Tonight must be for merriment for tomorrow we ride for glory... But before I presided over the Court at Havenwood, I was a simple Smithy's son. This is the story of Havenwood:

Will you ride with valour for the glory of Havenwood?

(The Havenwood crest shield reflects the history of Havenwood's inception; The trees that provided safe haven for my people and the arrows that took down the dragons.)



What we need:
$1000 is the immediate target to cover the costs of launching the campaign (graphic designer, composer, and the pins and rings).
The funds we receive will go to selecting and buying an appropriate property which must include a water source (rivers, lakes and dams), a forested area for trail rides, LARP adventures and quests, open areas with rich soil for livestock, and enough space to build the village and castle. We will be using the natural resources on the property like timber and stone to keep the costs down and also will be using the team at Havenwood to build as much as possible ourselves to reduce cost but we will still need to buy quarried stone and employ labourers to ensure Havenwood is built within a reasonable time frame and to the highest possible standard. 
If we don't get all the funds required then Havenwood will still be made but on a  smaller scale with fewer features. It will still be an agrarian medieval farm stay accommodation with activities and opportunities to LARP .



Stretch Targets
600,000 USD - Rustic Medieval Village
At this point we'd have enough to build a solid but rustic village which would include: a Great Hall (for meals and ceremonies as well as feasts and balls) a Stable, an Arena (for LARP tournaments) the farm (livestock, orchard, herb garden and greenhouse) and a dedicated LARP battlefield and LARP campsite as well as the swords, bows, arrows, horses, saddles, tack and other necessities. 
800,000 USD - Established Medieval Village
We can add the Alehouse and the Inn so we can serve mead and ale and a second LARP battlefield as well as a dedicated archery range and drill ground. 
1,000,000 USD - Medieval Town
We'll add a bake house and smoke house to serve higher quality meals, prepared fresh on sight as well as a fortified wall to surround the town. 
1,250,000 USD - Established Medieval Town
We'll add the Blacksmiths (a working forge and workshop) a Chandlery with bee hives and a market place with a fountain depicting the Havenwood gods. 
1,500,000 USD - Medieval City 
We can build a village outside the City for cottage accommodation for both our guests and staff and we'll add the mercenary camp. 
1,750,000 USD - City additions
We can build The Armoury and The Mages and Warriors Guild.
2,000,000 USD - Training additions
We can build the Tree top course; a high ropes obstacle course in the forest for Ranger training and we can start building some of the quest sites, like troll caves etc...
2,500,000 USD - City urpgrades
We can add a games hall to play D & D, as well as a Gallows, pecking cages, a Cooper, lumber mill and wood workshop, chapels, shrines, cobbled roads, carriages, a wedding site, bandit camp,  a well, Amphitheatre, Healer's hut, bell tower, signal fire, the steam rooms and hot baths and the dragon bone chandelier. 
3,000,000 USD - Great Hall upgrade
We can upgrade the Great Hall to a stone keep with secret passageways and castle-stay accommodation. 
6,000,000 USD+ - Havenwood Keep upgrade
We can upgrade the Stone keep to a large stone castle! And add a gate house, portcullis and drawbridge. 




The Impact
We want Havenwood to also be be a dedicated LARP hub for festivals and games. Even week long campaigns. We aim to hold a variety of festivals and forgotten trade fairs, Renaissance fairs, a Yule ball, jousting tournaments and celebrate the equinoxes. 
It is our aim at Havenwood to to bring people an ""immersive tourism"" experience and push what we're calling the Medieval Movement. 
Immersive Tourism - Immersive Tourism is almost like interactive theatre. It's a holiday experience that completely immerses the client into a world or experience much like a living RPG. In terms of the Havenwood experience it's like extreme D & D or LARP on the next level. I have worked for In Real Life Shooter which was an attempt at making a real life first person shooter with zombies. It was quite successful but very expensive for a two hour experience. We want to take an immersive experience to the next level and create a world that you can live in.
The Medieval Movement - The Medieval Movement is an attempt to bring people back to basics. Getting people to work together and relearn how to communicate without the modern technology we currently rely on. It's about eating fresh produce, sleeping better, getting out in the fresh and really relying on working together and cooperating. We currently must work almost twice as many days in the year to earn enough to house and feed ourselves than the average medieval peasant. We aim to teach people how easy it is to grow fresh produce and herbs at home, saving you money and keeping you healthy as well as home remedies for simple ailments, like headaches etc.

We can easily overcome these obstacles with your help. Pledge now to receive contributor savings and benefits. 
Other ways you can help
If you can't afford the the first perk, you can still help our campaign. You can spread the word, share the link, like the Facebook page or come to one of the Havenwood working bees. We are also taking expressions of interest for staff, especially if you know a forgotten trade (black smithing, chandlery, stable work etc) Please email us at havenwoodvillage@gmail.com with your current CV detailing your experience. 
Help us create an amazing experience by pledging and don't forget to share the campaign with your allies!
Sincerely,
The Havenwood Team!



The Small Council
Lord Torin Vane, first of his name, Lord of Havenwood, Keeper of the Forest and Protector of the Realms of men – 
Torin was a simple smithy's son who lived in a quiet hamlet on the edge of the Kingswood. Forsaking his father's trade, he learned the ways of the wilderness from his childhood friends, the Elves. Having had adventure thrust upon him, his many travels to root out the court magisters led him on a journey to the dragon ranges. Aided by loyal friends along the way who would end up serving as his Small Council, he is both terrified and excited at the prospect of living up to his new title and constructing the new Fief of Havenwood. He hopes all in the Kingdom will act upon their guest right and seek out Havenwood Village.

Adrick ‘Fargrim’ Ironfist (Master of Coin) –

Adrick Fargrim or ‘Grim’ to Lord Vane, was branded ‘Ironfist’ by the Guild of Merchants, so reluctant to part with coin was he. Knowing how that name could cripple his business interests he quickly cultivated a reputation as a bad tempered bar room brawler. A sour deal with a Dwarven smith led to the fingerless gauntlet that he is seldom seen without. He currently resides as Master of Coin, protecting the financial interests of Havenwood’s coffers in the traditional blacks and midnight blues that befit his station.

Ylva Jorrun (Havenwood Huntswoman and Stable Master)-


Ylva was born into the austere life of the Raider Clan. Showing sufficient discipline and skill, Ylva was accepted to the trials as a child but lacking the blood lust expected of the clan’s warriors, she was assigned the less honourable position of beast keeper. Among the horses, however, she finally felt at home.
Ylva was sent by her master to see to the animals when the High Clansman, out of pride and greed, lead his warriors to raid the fabled Elven wood, where the elves were said to hold treasures greater than man could imagine.  He led his warriors to their demise.
When all her clansmen had perished or fled Ylva was found by the elves injured and unconscious but encircled by the horses she cared for. They had not fled the battle but remained protectively with her. This intrigued the elves and they took her in and cared for her as she recovered. 
Ylva remained with the elves as she grew until it was seen that she must journey on. As emissary of the elves she was sent to seek out Torin Vane and aid him in his new role as Lord of Havenwood as the Lord’s protector and Huntswoman.

Heed the call...
My brothers-in-arms, join me in a quest to build us a home and fulfil the prophecy. Help give us all a place to be free. Help build our home.


Yours in service,
Lord Torin Vane 
First of his name, Lord of Havenwood, Keeper of the forest and Protector of the realms of men.

I began to see how important good roasting was. More-importantly, I was able to introduce more people to great coffee when I had a lower cost and price point.

<p><span>Hi! We are Christen and Julia, and we want to bring your community bookstore to you!</span></p>
<p>A few years back, we met at the Denver Publishing Institute and had a blast learning how to become publishing rockstars. Then, we both ended up in Charleston, South Carolina, and we couldn’t get bookstores off our brains.</p>Charleston is made up of many vibrant neighborhoods, but we have always thought that most of them have lacked  something very special, something that is really quite key for  community spaces: bookstores! Finally, we decided if no one else would bring the bookstores, we’d bring one ourselves.<p></p> </div><div>
<p><span>Like other business ventures, bookstores are expensive. The books, the build out, the rent, the bills: they all add up. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And as we both hail from the publishing industry,  we aren't exactly raking it in. So, we decided that instead of giving up on our dream, we would flip the script: who says we need to be in one location? Who says we have to have rent in a tourist town? It worked for so many food trucks; we think it can work for bookstores, too. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This is where you, dear reader, come in. <br/></span></p>
<p>We know Charleston neighborhoods want to see a great new bookstore here because we’ve heard from them. We asked around, the votes are in: you love books, and  you want more of them.  We also know (hope) that our neighbors are supportive and generous.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>To date, we have met with several local literacy and education-focused nonprofits to develop partnerships. While we are an LLC and not a nonprofit, a key point of our business plan is to be the best asset and advocate for our community as we can. We have met with the local affiliate of the WINGS program and helped organize a benefit for Begin With Books, an affiliate of the Dolly Parton Imagination Library, which gives every child enrolled one free book a month from ages 0-5. In June, we were awarded a $1,000 grant by Enough Pie to develop a play street program called <a href=""http://enoughpie.org/playup-charleston/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PlayUp Charleston</a> in the Upper Peninsula, with the goal of encouraging creative learning and interaction in the community.</p>
<p>We're always looking for more ways to get involved with our community, so if you have a cause dear to your heart, let us know! The successful funding of this campaign will enable us to do so much more than we have: with this money and these resources, we will be able to get books into the hands of our neighbors, and facilitate larger events, fundraisers and more. </p>

Our new goal will go toward purchasing our mobile unit (gutted Airstream trailer, currently picked out), renovations of the unit, an expanded inventory, and promotions for upcoming events. With these objects in mind, we've revised our budget to be as follows:

OccupancyThe trailer, building shelves, making it look nice: $10,000Promotion + Expanded InventorySigns, posters, branded items, cute things we make for events, inventory for events through the end of 2015: $5,000 
Short Summary 
Hi! We are Christen and Julia, and we want to bring your community bookstore to you!
A few years back, we met at the Denver Publishing Institute and had a blast learning how to become publishing rockstars. Then, we both ended up in Charleston, South Carolina, and we couldn’t get bookstores off our brains.Charleston is made up of many vibrant neighborhoods, but we have always thought that most of them have lacked  something very special, something that is really quite key for  community spaces: bookstores! Finally, we decided if no one else would bring the bookstores, we’d bring one ourselves. 
Like other business ventures, bookstores are expensive. The books, the build out, the rent, the bills: they all add up. And as we both hail from the publishing industry,  we aren't exactly raking it in. So, we decided that instead of giving up on our dream, we would flip the script: who says we need to be in one location? Who says we have to have rent in a tourist town? It worked for so many food trucks; we think it can work for bookstores, too. 
This is where you, dear reader, come in. 
We know Charleston neighborhoods want to see a great new bookstore here because we’ve heard from them. We asked around, the votes are in: you love books, and  you want more of them.  We also know (hope) that our neighbors are supportive and generous.

What We Need & What You Get

As we mentioned, bookstores are expensive. The vast majority of our funds will be dedicated toward the curation of our inventory, which will be tailored to our customers (you!)
Occupancy The trailer, building shelves, repairs, making it look nice, etc: 10,000
Operations 
Point of sale system, computer, taxes, shipping, the books (yay!), industry organization subscriptions, and so much more: 50,000
Promotion 
Signs, posters, business cards, branded items, cute things we make for events: 5,000





Never fear, friends. Not only will you be rewarded with an excellent bookmobile once our campaign is (successfully!) completed, but you’ll also get one (or more) of the rewards we’re offering for your very appreciated contribution.

We’ve got swag: tote bags, journals, and coffee mugs


We’ve got books (obviously!)
And for all those true book nerds out there, we’ve got party plans: customized trivia, children's party, book releases--you want it, we'll do it. 
The Impact






A book can be a spark. A book can open your world and give you a chance to stimulate your creativity and intellect at your own pace and spurred by the things that interest you. 



Our schools and our teachers work to instill this, but they are not the only ones responsible and they are not the only places to go. One great place is a book store. 

To date, we have met with several local literacy and education-focused nonprofits to develop partnerships. While we are an LLC and not a nonprofit, a key point of our business plan is to be the best asset and advocate for our community as we can. We have met with the local affiliate of the WINGS program and helped organize a benefit for Begin With Books, an affiliate of the Dolly Parton Imagination Library, which gives every child enrolled one free book a month from ages 0-5. In June, we were awarded a $1,000 grant by Enough Pie to develop a play street program called PlayUp Charleston in the Upper Peninsula, with the goal of encouraging creative learning and interaction in the community.
We're always looking for more ways to get involved with our community, so if you have a cause dear to your heart, let us know! The successful funding of this campaign will enable us to do so much more than we have: with this money and these resources, we will be able to get books into the hands of our neighbors, and facilitate larger events, fundraisers and more. 

We don't pretend to be literacy experts or say that we will fix the literacy issue in Charleston, but this is something we can do to help. Creating another place for someone to get exposure to books is only going to help the issue. We want to be a place where everyone can come and feel included and like they can take time for themselves. Where they can discover new worlds and possibilities, both young and old. 


Risks & Challenges

  Here's the situation: there are these things called ""ebooks"" and ""ereaders"" that naysayers keep insisting are pulling down the sales of physical books. And you know, their claims aren't without merit. But of late, the physical book has been making a comeback, and it's all because book lovers, like you and us, just can't let them go.
The other thing is that the price of books are set by publishers. Should our overhead costs go up, we can't raise the price of our goods to cover them, like many other traditional retailers can. On the other side, since the price we pay for books is based on their set ""list"" price (aka, the price customers buy them at), we're also locked in from a buyer's standpoint. Should we want to drop prices, we can only do so very slightly, or we risk losing money.
Where do we come in...

For both of us, reading was our first friends and best teacher, and our hometown bookstores were the playdate spots and schoolhouse. We're both the kind of people who will go to a bookstore and gather the books that we want to buy around us and sit on the floor, trying desperately to decide what to get and always walking out having spent more than we wanted to.   We know books; we like getting to know people. When we pair those skills, book magic happens. We are going to give you the best browsing experience of your life! Browsing is the key to discovering your next favorite book, and only bookstores can offer that.
Since our space is small, our stock can be tailored specifically to your neighborhood.    Other Ways You Can Help We totally understand not having spare cash lying around, but there are other ways you can contribute to our campaign!  Get out there and spread the word to all your friends: Indiegogo's share tools make this easy We are actively selling books, right now! Head over to our website and see if there's something that interests you. Or let us know what you're looking for, and we'll find it!",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

</h2><h2></h2><h2><b>Our motivation for this

</h2><p>We want to make
*Mio me* a leading and significant manufacturer and trend setter for outstanding

<p>Within the last 2

<h2>
<br/><b><span></span></b>
</h2><h2><b><span>Why we believe in *Mio

<p><span>There
is an increasing demand for pet gear. </span>*Mio me* is the <b>only
manufacturer</b> of hand made pet accessories in all of Namibia<span>. We are working with limited resources; there are many requests
both from customers and bulk outlets which we unfortunately have to turn down. Therefore,
we need a few essential changes. </span></p>
<p><b><i>That’s where we would like </i></b><b><i>you</i></b><b><i> to come in! We need your assistance to raise

</h2><p>The first *Mio*’s
were sewn in order to cover the costs of increasing food and vet bills of
numerous street cats and kittens that we fostered in our village. The
customized beds were selling well, since it was a niche in the Namibian market.
After our move to the capital Windhoek, we were offered a great opportunity to
rent a stall at the beautiful Namibia Crafts Centre, a unique spot downtown
that attracts tourists as well as locals, where hand-crafted Namibian products
are sold. Our funds were limited, and we started off with a tiny stall and a
small choice of *Mio*’s:<span>  8 collars, a handful
of bandanas, and a few cat toys. The business grew steadily. We recently moved
to a bigger space within the center and we could create full-time employment
for our sales lady Kristofina in March. We also were able to increase our stock
to about two hundred individually designed and crafted items (collars, leashes,
bandanas, harnesses, treat bags and toys).</span></p>
<p>Currently, we are
taking the first steps to restructure our business. *Mio* was re-branded to *Mio
me*, but our vision and mission remain the same. </p>
<p><b><span></span></b></p><h2>
<br/>
</h2><h2></h2><h2><b><span>What is important to us</span></b></h2><ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>*Mio
me* is a <b>Namibian company</b>. Namibia used
to import most of its goods.Thanks
to the thriving local business empowerment initiative: <b>*Local is Lekker*</b> (lekker is the Afrikaans word for “good”), more
and more Namibians support us local businesses and help create new jobs in a
country with an estimated unemployment rate of about 45%. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span><span></span></span></span><span>We want to <b>create fair
jobs</b> for motivated, skilled Namibians. With a small team of experts in
different crafts, we can add hand-made items to our range which are not yet available,
or differ in look and quality from what the market offers so far.</span>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>In
addition, we want to create awareness for the needs of pets, and keep on supporting
the work of local welfare organizations like the educational <b>PAKO kid’s magazine</b>, as well as the wonderful
<b>Have-a-Heart Spay and Neuter </b>project.
When fostering street cats, we also work closely with the <b>Cat Protection Society</b>. We will continue contributing to fund-raising
competitions by giving *Mio me* products as prizes, donating parts of our profit
to organizations like the SPCA, and offering discounts on their orders.\</li></ul><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439975500/yefgksephcmnco7stbgz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p></p><h2></h2><h2><b>Meet team *Mio me*</b></h2><h2>
</h2><p><b>Lena</b> – the Allrounder:</p>
<p>In 2011, shortly after
my 30<sup>th</sup> birthday, I (Lena) left Germany, my country, to work as a
teacher in a village in northern Namibia. This is where I met my husband
Brazil, and we decided to move to the capital in 2013. While struggling to find
a job as a teacher (everything happens for a reason!), I was encouraged by
several customers to convert *Mio me* to a full-time business. I haven’t
regretted this step ever since. I LOVE what I am doing, though it was extremely
tough at times since I had about 100$ to get started. My various
responsibilities are marketing, customer service, and other operational duties.
I design and manufacture every *Mio* myself. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Brazil</b><span><b>  </b>- our Finance and Admin nerd, doubles up as
husband:</span></p>
<p>Brazil does our
weekly book-keeping after he knocks off from his first job. We want to pay him
a fair salary for all his efforts and include him into the business a few more
hours a week to take over more *Mio me* responsibilities as we grow.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Kristofina</b> - our sales fundi:</p>
<p>Kristofina is a
34 year-old Namibian, and mother of a 5-year-old son. She is working full-time
at our *Mio me* stall. She receives an average salary which we would love to
increase, since she does a great job and deserves better! We would also like to
provide her with proper health care.</p>
<p><br/></p><p>The test-drivers, our supermodels
and our daily inspiration:</p>
<p><b>Jabu, Krishna, Salsa and Saleh</b>, our 4 former street cats, and <b>Naimah and Ivy</b>, our 2 dogs, are our
daily inspiration. They are always around, and continuously motivate us as we
try to make their lives more exciting and comfortable. Their views matter.
Every *Mio me* product is tested and trialed by them. Seeing them enjoying
their *Mio*’s is our best reward!</p>
<p><b><span></span></b></p><h2>
<br/>
</h2><h2></h2><h2><b><span>Our vision for team *Mio
me*</span></b></h2><h2>
</h2><p><span>It
is envisioned that in the end, we will be offering full-time employment. For
now, part-time jobs and the commissioning of work is a first step on our
way to guarantee long-term employment. </span>We will definitely deliver many more *Mio*’s much faster with
more hired support.</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span><span></span></span></span><span>Firstly, we want to hire a crafter to <b>weave</b> beautiful traditional <b>baskets</b>,
to counter the general and ongoing extinction of this beautiful Namibian
indigenous craft. We could then also offer these as dog baskets in different
sizes to which we will add cat caves and scratching poles.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span><span></span></span></span><span>Recycled pallets, driftwood and other reusable materials
(tires, bottles, cans, old suitcases e.g.) can be up-cycled with an
underemployed <b>crafter</b> for different
uses: dog houses, bed frames, drinking bowls or dog tags.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span><span></span></span></span><span>Thirdly, we want to work with a <b>tailoress</b>, who will innovatively and creatively work on new ideas,
and help to put them to action so that I can focus more on growth and new
business. </span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Wages in Namibia are way below those in
many Western countries, and living in Windhoek is very expensive. The aim is to
offer our employees a <b>competitive and
reasonable salary package</b>. </span>We
hope to provide every team member with proper health care latest by June 2016. <span>In the long run, we would love to provide the team – Brazil, Kristofina,
the three new team members, and myself – with the financial means for a decent
living through *Mio me*.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2>
<br/>
</h2><h2></h2><h2><b>What we will use the
funds for</b></h2>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Employing of crafters:</b> (see above) Our team-members will be
motivated to continue using their traditional crafts. This guarantees the
ongoing appreciation of the crafts of our customers. Also, this warrants an
ongoing extension of our product range, and I will find more time to work on aspects
of product innovation and business expansion. The amount would pay the salaries until the
turnover is expected to increase.      1800 $ 
</li></ul><ul><li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Material</b>: A sufficient availability of material (buckles, webbing,
ribbon, fabric e.g.) to avoid current production delays. Additionally, we need
different woods for the new products, as well as some basic tools to get
started.      1700 $<br/>
</li></ul><ul><li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Proper equipment and furnishing</b>: For recycling and upcycling from
discarded material, space-efficient furniture and market equipment, and shop
fittings (offering employment to wood-crafters).      800 $ 

</li></ul><p></p><ul><li>An
<b>industrial sewing machine</b>: My hobby machine, that poor thing is struggling, especially with several layers of webbing when making the collars.       600 $

</li></ul><ul><li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Promotion costs</b>: For this campaign, adverts, brochures and business cards,
and the donation of prizes for local ruffles that support animal welfare and to
get our name out there. An upgrade of our website will allow us to add an
online shop to it.     700 $<br/>
</li></ul><p>
</p><ul><li>

would enable the growth and sustainability of *Mio me* after the time of the
intended transition (approx. 3-4 months) and the substantial increase of
our monthly turnover. 


Why we believe in *Mio
me*
There
is an increasing demand for pet gear. *Mio me* is the only
manufacturer of hand made pet accessories in all of Namibia. We are working with limited resources; there are many requests
both from customers and bulk outlets which we unfortunately have to turn down. Therefore,
we need a few essential changes. 
That’s where we would like you to come in! We need your assistance to raise
the necessary funds to spread our wings and distribute more *Mio me* products
within Namibia, and, in the longer run, around the world! With your support, we
can make it happen!


Background
The first *Mio*’s
were sewn in order to cover the costs of increasing food and vet bills of
numerous street cats and kittens that we fostered in our village. The
customized beds were selling well, since it was a niche in the Namibian market.
After our move to the capital Windhoek, we were offered a great opportunity to
rent a stall at the beautiful Namibia Crafts Centre, a unique spot downtown
that attracts tourists as well as locals, where hand-crafted Namibian products
are sold. Our funds were limited, and we started off with a tiny stall and a
small choice of *Mio*’s:  8 collars, a handful
of bandanas, and a few cat toys. The business grew steadily. We recently moved
to a bigger space within the center and we could create full-time employment
for our sales lady Kristofina in March. We also were able to increase our stock
to about two hundred individually designed and crafted items (collars, leashes,
bandanas, harnesses, treat bags and toys).
Currently, we are
taking the first steps to restructure our business. *Mio* was re-branded to *Mio
me*, but our vision and mission remain the same. 


What is important to us
*Mio
me* is a Namibian company. Namibia used
to import most of its goods.Thanks
to the thriving local business empowerment initiative: *Local is Lekker* (lekker is the Afrikaans word for “good”), more
and more Namibians support us local businesses and help create new jobs in a
country with an estimated unemployment rate of about 45%. 

We want to create fair
jobs for motivated, skilled Namibians. With a small team of experts in
different crafts, we can add hand-made items to our range which are not yet available,
or differ in look and quality from what the market offers so far.

In
addition, we want to create awareness for the needs of pets, and keep on supporting
the work of local welfare organizations like the educational PAKO kid’s magazine, as well as the wonderful
Have-a-Heart Spay and Neuter project.
When fostering street cats, we also work closely with the Cat Protection Society. We will continue contributing to fund-raising
competitions by giving *Mio me* products as prizes, donating parts of our profit
to organizations like the SPCA, and offering discounts on their orders.\
Meet team *Mio me*
Lena – the Allrounder:
In 2011, shortly after
my 30th birthday, I (Lena) left Germany, my country, to work as a
teacher in a village in northern Namibia. This is where I met my husband
Brazil, and we decided to move to the capital in 2013. While struggling to find
a job as a teacher (everything happens for a reason!), I was encouraged by
several customers to convert *Mio me* to a full-time business. I haven’t
regretted this step ever since. I LOVE what I am doing, though it was extremely
tough at times since I had about 100$ to get started. My various
responsibilities are marketing, customer service, and other operational duties.
I design and manufacture every *Mio* myself. 
Brazil  - our Finance and Admin nerd, doubles up as
husband:
Brazil does our
weekly book-keeping after he knocks off from his first job. We want to pay him
a fair salary for all his efforts and include him into the business a few more
hours a week to take over more *Mio me* responsibilities as we grow.
Kristofina - our sales fundi:
Kristofina is a
34 year-old Namibian, and mother of a 5-year-old son. She is working full-time
at our *Mio me* stall. She receives an average salary which we would love to
increase, since she does a great job and deserves better! We would also like to
provide her with proper health care.
The test-drivers, our supermodels
and our daily inspiration:
Jabu, Krishna, Salsa and Saleh, our 4 former street cats, and Naimah and Ivy, our 2 dogs, are our
daily inspiration. They are always around, and continuously motivate us as we
try to make their lives more exciting and comfortable. Their views matter.
Every *Mio me* product is tested and trialed by them. Seeing them enjoying
their *Mio*’s is our best reward!


Our vision for team *Mio
me*
It
is envisioned that in the end, we will be offering full-time employment. For
now, part-time jobs and the commissioning of work is a first step on our
way to guarantee long-term employment. We will definitely deliver many more *Mio*’s much faster with
more hired support.

Firstly, we want to hire a crafter to weave beautiful traditional baskets,
to counter the general and ongoing extinction of this beautiful Namibian
indigenous craft. We could then also offer these as dog baskets in different
sizes to which we will add cat caves and scratching poles.


Recycled pallets, driftwood and other reusable materials
(tires, bottles, cans, old suitcases e.g.) can be up-cycled with an
underemployed crafter for different
uses: dog houses, bed frames, drinking bowls or dog tags.


Thirdly, we want to work with a tailoress, who will innovatively and creatively work on new ideas,
and help to put them to action so that I can focus more on growth and new
business. 

Wages in Namibia are way below those in
many Western countries, and living in Windhoek is very expensive. The aim is to
offer our employees a competitive and
reasonable salary package. We
hope to provide every team member with proper health care latest by June 2016. In the long run, we would love to provide the team – Brazil, Kristofina,
the three new team members, and myself – with the financial means for a decent
living through *Mio me*.

What we will use the
funds for

Employing of crafters: (see above) Our team-members will be
motivated to continue using their traditional crafts. This guarantees the
ongoing appreciation of the crafts of our customers. Also, this warrants an
ongoing extension of our product range, and I will find more time to work on aspects
of product innovation and business expansion. The amount would pay the salaries until the
turnover is expected to increase.      1800 $ 

Material: A sufficient availability of material (buckles, webbing,
ribbon, fabric e.g.) to avoid current production delays. Additionally, we need
different woods for the new products, as well as some basic tools to get
started.      1700 $

Proper equipment and furnishing: For recycling and upcycling from
discarded material, space-efficient furniture and market equipment, and shop
fittings (offering employment to wood-crafters).      800 $ 

An
industrial sewing machine: My hobby machine, that poor thing is struggling, especially with several layers of webbing when making the collars.       600 $


Promotion costs: For this campaign, adverts, brochures and business cards,
and the donation of prizes for local ruffles that support animal welfare and to
get our name out there. An upgrade of our website will allow us to add an
online shop to it.     700 $


Unforeseen expenses:     200 $

Straight off the bat around 70% of those 10k will be going towards launching this campaign(from set up fees, recording costs, and majorly the cost of the goods sold in the perks section) Also i plan to donate 15% of my revenues, meaning ill donate $1500 if i reach my goal to several ""GudVybes"". I mean to spread GudVybes into different causes like helping professors from low resources school develop cool projects for kids, helping internationally by giving 30 families clean water for a year, changing the life of a homeless guy, giving to cancer research, and last but not least help my family in Venezuela. Finally the rest of the money will go to my pockets(15% or 1500 for a whole summer worth of work), which will most likely be used to expand my business, ranging from maintaining the GudVybes brand alive, to improving the size and quality of my Youtube Rap Channel. Plus, no one likes doing an unpaid internship.</li> <li>What i love about this crowdfunding campaign is that if you donate you get something in return(what indiegogo calls ""perks"")!

<p>Earth Evolved was created by two people -- a young couple with the same ideas and questions about life. We just started a couple months ago, and have already released our website, which includes a shop and blog. Our blog helps us to connect with people and potential customers about issues that matter. We also provide simple DIY tips &amp; tricks for sustainability.</p>
<p>We just got our first sales this past week and could not be more excited about it. The reason we're excited, doesn't have to do with money. We're excited because a movement of sustainability and eco-friendly practices is taking over the world right now. This is a trend that actually <b>matters</b>.</p>
<p>We are striving to make Earth Evolved a one-stop-shop for people looking to make positive changes in their life...Whether it's switching out chemical filled home products for natural ones or it's using solar energy to power simple devices. We want to be the place that makes this <b>easy</b> for people. No one should have to search Google for hours finding the perfect water purifier, natural beauty products, energy drinks, organic gardening products, etc.</p>
<p>The only way we can achieve this dream is with your help. Whether you're an eco-conscious person, thinking about it, or just interested in the idea, we need you!</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How We're Different:</h3>
<p>We tried to think about what frustrated us most about changing our lifestyle to one that was greener and more sustainable. We came up with a few problems, and then found solutions.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>We Only Offer Products We've Used In Our Home.</b>  When you're searching for natural products online, you'll find hundreds upon thousands of solutions. We cut out the dirty work and make it simple for you. We will only post products on our website that we or a family member has used in our homes.</li>
<li>
<b>Monthly Top 10 Products + Video.</b>  Every month we add 10 products to our Top 10 department. We believe that these products deserve some extra spotlight, and know that you'll love them too. To really show you how great each products is, we will create and upload a 30-second video for each of our Top 10 products. This allows you and other customers to really see for yourselves why we think these products are so great.</li>
<li>
<b>Only Supporting Brands We're Proud Of.</b>  We care about the whole package. What’s inside of the product, how it was manufactured, the company’s values, and so much more. We only support brands that are trying to make a difference in the world. Animal testing, fair trade, organic ingredients -- all of that is taken into consideration</li>
</ol>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help:</h3> <p><b>Inventory</b></p>
<ul>
<li>With the money raised on IndieGoGo, our doors are going to open up to so many more products, which we can add to our site. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Drop shipping isn't that common, especially for smaller companies that provide sustainable products. So the only way we can become distributors for more natural inventory, is with money to purchase it.</span>
</li>
<li>With inventory, we can provide samples of some of our products to people, so they can test it against those that they are currently using. Some people still have doubts about natural &amp; sustainable products, believing that they aren't as effective as those from a lab. But that's not true and we want to help people to realize that!</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Business Costs</b></div>
<ul>
<li>We quit our full-time jobs in the renewable energy industry to pursue our dream at Earth Evolved. We work from home to not have any added costs, but there are still the basics like electricity, water, etc. A small portion of this money would go towards helping us keep the business running.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

How We're Different:
We tried to think about what frustrated us most about changing our lifestyle to one that was greener and more sustainable. We came up with a few problems, and then found solutions.



We Only Offer Products We've Used In Our Home.  When you're searching for natural products online, you'll find hundreds upon thousands of solutions. We cut out the dirty work and make it simple for you. We will only post products on our website that we or a family member has used in our homes.

We only support brands that are trying to make a difference in the world. Animal testing, fair trade, organic ingredients -- all of that is taken into consideration



Why We Need Your Help: Inventory

With the money raised on IndieGoGo, our doors are going to open up to so many more products, which we can add to our site. Drop shipping isn't that common, especially for smaller companies that provide sustainable products. So the only way we can become distributors for more natural inventory, is with money to purchase it.

With inventory, we can provide samples of some of our products to people, so they can test it against those that they are currently using. Some people still have doubts about natural & sustainable products, believing that they aren't as effective as those from a lab. But that's not true and we want to help people to realize that!

Business Costs

We quit our full-time jobs in the renewable energy industry to pursue our dream at Earth Evolved. We work from home to not have any added costs, but there are still the basics like electricity, water, etc. A small portion of this money would go towards helping us keep the business running.

<p>When coming to Princeton, I dreamed of establishing special yoga works that would help many, especially helping share the fullness of all yoga has to offer. </p>

</div></div>","Help us create a stunningly beautiful not-for-profit Yoga Community Center in the heart of Princeton!


We are creating something completely new and different in the Princeton area... not only a studio, but a Yoga Community Center where, at no fee, people can take yoga classes, come for Guided Meditations, participate in The Enlightened Readings Bookclub or The Bhagavad Gita Study Group, come for Kirtan or the monthly Nataraj Dance Party, use the beautiful meditation room, The Oasis, or hang out in The Nook to read from our library and enjoy some tea! 



But we can't do this alone. 
Will you please help us?



From Our Director, Jayadeva:
It has been my dream and life's purpose to share the yoga teachings with people. Since I was a child I have held a vision of doing this! Then, after meeting my Guru, Sri Swami Satchidananda, it became even clearer to me.
I began teaching yoga in 1969, managed one of the oldest and largest yoga centers in the country, the New York Integral Yoga Institute, for 5 years, have been training great yoga instructors for 20 years, and moved to Princeton, New Jersey 16 years ago.
When coming to Princeton, I dreamed of establishing special yoga works that would help many, especially helping share the fullness of all yoga has to offer. 
Since then a wonderful spiritual community has blossomed. We set up a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit yoga work which the IRS called ""a spiritual mission."" We then created the Princeton Integral Yoga Institute 7 years ago. 
Small beginnings...



Our original space only had a single studio space, but we became one of the most active yoga works around with a staff of 50 people offering a large range of yoga classes, workshops, events with visiting renowned kirtan artists, presenters, sages and saints, yoga teacher trainings, dance programs, and much more.

But we found that our location and space truly limited us. 
There was SO much more we have wanted to give to the community! 
We have finally found the ideal space for the IYI and it has opened us to creating a truly unique service for the community.
We will call our new space The Princeton Integral Yoga Community Center.
   The NEW Princeton Integral Yoga Community Center 


The Princeton Integral Yoga Community Center will be located at the Princeton Shopping Center at the heart of Princeton. 
What the new IY Community Center will offer:


44 Yoga classes for all levels, accommodating those new, those experienced and those with special challenges, all at very affordable rates.

Extended hours (6:30am to 9:30pm on weekdays, and 7am to 2:30pm on weekends)

Open doors during those extended hours! Everyone will be welcome to come in at no fee, take advantage of the lovely dedicated meditation room, ""The Oasis,"" or hang out in ""The Nook,"" a comfortable room with a spiritual library and places to sit to have tea alone or with friends. 
Free guided meditations in ""The Oasis"" weekdays both morning and evening.
Free weekly study of the Bhagavad Gita.

Free-yoga-for-all on Community Yoga Day,  the 2nd Saturday of each month.

Free monthly Enlightened Readings Bookclub gathering.
Free monthly kirtan chanting evening.
Free monthly Nataraj Dance Party and so much more!
Special offerings will include:


Before-work & lunchtime yoga classes
Our renowned Yoga Teacher Training courses
Lots of special yoga-related workshops and courses

Programs with renowned presenters, performers and yogis

Beautiful yoga retreats, and more! 
The gorgeous new space!
Below are the architect's rendering of what we are building together.
A soundproof movable wall will allow us to have multiple classes occurring at once, or open the space for large events, kirtans, workshops and special performances!


Imagine yourself hanging out in ""The Nook,"" a sitting room with a spiritual library and places to reflect, have tea alone or with friends.

Why $200,000?



Demolition costs- $43,000. Because the space was previously a dermatologist's center, all 8 treatment rooms must be completely removed, including the sinks and electric socket units sticking up out of the floor. Several other rooms must be completely taken down to open the space for us to re-shape it into the beautiful place we want to make for everyone. Only the bathrooms and one office can be left as they are. The estimate for this work is $43,000.

Wall/Floor construction- $80,000. We need to construct the walls, put in the special flooring to do yoga and dance safely and comfortably, put a special sound-proof removable wall between the two studios so that they will be private classrooms and then open into a wonderful large presentation hall with a stage that folds up into the wall, the lighting, the sound system, building the pantry and The Nook and The Oasis, and then getting the supplies for all of the operations is estimated at another $80,000.
We need $123,000 to create the space itself.
Other Estimated Costs:
Our business plan projections show that we need an additional $100,000 as a capital fund to sustain the operational overhead expenses while people are discovering what we have for them in this lovely new space.
All of our instructors teach an average of one class per week as an offering without pay, and most of our staff also work without pay, too. This allows us to keep our rates low, and even more importantly creates such a beautiful atmosphere of loving service!

</div><p><b>The Short Story </b></p><p>We've invented a new type of utensil that will not only make life easier but will greatly reduce the environmental impact of paper napkins. For example, if trongs were used on just 10% of chicken wings consumed, we'd save at least 3,000,000 napkins per year! In the US alone! Unlike any other eating utensil, it is an interface between your fingers and food because it allows you to pinch your food just like you do without a utensil while keeping your fingers clean. We need you, your friends, and other smart, good-looking people to help fund a new manufacturing tool for the new design, with new material. </p><p><b>The Longer Story</b></p><p><b>The Pothole On the Road to Techville</b></p><p>A few years back, Dan and I were eating wings and ribs while working on another invention. The phone in Dan's pocket rang but his fingers were held captive by sauce. He scrambled to wipe his hands to extract his phone but still managed to drag a stain onto his pants just after the last ring. </p><p>Well, it must have been the Future calling and we need your help returning the call. </p><p>Since that day, we have worked tirefully (yeah, we're exhausted) to create the utensil that was missing from civilization: the trong. </p><p>The trongs concept feels not like an invention, but a discovery of what other people would have invented years ago if they had the materials/tech. </p><p>Here are the limitations in other eating utensils: chopsticks pinch food but only at two points and are tricky to use. The fork, relatively recent technology, is pretty limited. If you're not using it for balancing meager square-inch bits of food, then you are skewering a solid chuck of only boneless food in order to transport it to your mouth. </p><p>The ideal utensil for solid foods larger than a few millimeters is the one that works most similarly to the hand(bio-mimicry), while still providing the benefit of shielding our fingers from the food and vice versa. Right? </p><p>We agree and that's one of the reasons we were awarded US Patent # 8,419,092 (plus international) and why some folks at the History Channel's Invention USA gave us the thumbs up and connected us to our prototype injection mold for model 38. We manufactured trongs off that and were grateful winners in the QVC Sprouts Program, which got us on QVC thrice, the Today Show twice, BBC/PRI, with many more to come. </p><p>Here are some of the practical applications of trongs:</p><ul>
<li>Eating buffalo wings, shrimp cocktail, barbecue ribs, crudite platters, cheese puffs, and sushi</li>
<li>Food prep, such as dredging chicken cutlets</li>
<li>Politely pinching neighboring pizza slices to separate yours from the pie</li>
<li>Eating hors d'oeuvres at social or professional events and keeping your hands available for shaking</li>
<li>And most importantly, keeping your fingers free for tickling your tech</li>
</ul><p><b>The Ask At Hand</b></p><p>All that pumping out of product has finished off our soft aluminum prototype mold and now we need a bigger and harder one (insert tasteless joke here).

Here’s why: regarding how many people can benefit from this invention, there are more than 7 billion chronic masticators on this marble-we eat all the dang time. More of these people have a cell phone than access to a flushable toilet! (<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/03/23/more-people-have-mobile-phones-than-toilets/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/03...</a>).  This fact actually speaks to two dimensions of benefit: the prevalence of high tech, and the need for hygiene. The latter point assumes that a goodly amount of the 2,500,000 people who do not have a toilet probably lack running water for ‘post production’ hand washing.

It's true because this technology provides you great benefit! Like essentially transcending time and space so you can talk to people out of earshot. Or learn about a totally new type of eating utensil! An invention that you and lots of other people from all over the world can help fund so you can get your hands on it, feed your biology and feel your technology all in one sitting. So back to our criteria of how many, how much, how often, and how long, and these little finger things are looking pretty good. </p><p><b>The Environ<i>m</i></b><b><i>ental Case</i>-Gotta be crazy not to.</b></p><p>Let's look at the environmental impact because that's the part of the benefit calculation that is easily superficialized if considered at all by most. We are looking to raise money for tooling to mass produce stainless steel trongs. An injection mold for <i>plastic</i>! What a horrible word right? Not. Although we will continue to research material for a biodegradable trong, the reality is that most trash winds up in landfills, not composts. In a landfill, there is very little biodegradation. (see <a href=""http://humanitieslab.stanford.edu/23/174)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://humanitieslab.stanford.edu/23/174).</a> We are committed to minimizing any negative environmental effects and even the beta trongs that we ran off the aluminum prototype mold, and offered in our ship now perks, are made from a reusable polypropylene plastic. Still, we saw some on-line reviews from people who thought that those trongs ""looked flimsy"", the reality is that they are light and gracile as is required for comfort, but yet are quite durable so that they can be washed and reused by consumers. And yes, plastic is made from petroleum, which we pull from the ground, but we don't burn this fossil fuel, and even if folks eventually throw them away, and the trongs don’t follow the normal garbage vector to a landfill, then they go back into the earth as a largely inert food-safe unit. The worst and truly bad case is if they wind up in our waterways or oceans. In their current form this is unlikely due to the size. Hopefully, people will cherish their trongs so much, they get appendagized like cell phones did.</p><p><b>What Do We  Do With Our Freedom? </b></p><p>If just 1% of the world's population reclaims just 30 seconds every day, that's 5.8 million hours of human productivity! Per Day! The benefit is not just time and convenience depending on whatever we do with our tech, but paper napkins and energy used to treat, heat, and pump the water that washes trongless fingers when we are prepping food in the kitchen or prior to eating. Granted, we still wash the trong once, at the end of the use event, but that’s twice as good as washing twice, before and after, or the half a dozen times a home cook might during a proper dinner prep.</p><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p><p>Let's be realistic though; we are asking people to change the way they do something very visceral-eating. We don't have to look that far to see that we humans don't always quickly adopt a new and better way of doing things. But I sincerely think this friction is being lubricated by technology, more specifically the information that we share using technology. We are learning to learn, to adopt new apps, and ways of doing things. Besides, the singularity is on our side. </p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p><p>Even if you cannot provide funding now, please share with all your friends and everyone else.

And yes, plastic is made from petroleum, which we pull from the ground, but we don't burn this fossil fuel, and even if folks eventually throw them away, and the trongs don’t follow the normal garbage vector to a landfill, then they go back into the earth as a largely inert food-safe unit. The worst and truly bad case is if they wind up in our waterways or oceans. In their current form this is unlikely due to the size. Hopefully, people will cherish their trongs so much, they get appendagized like cell phones did.What Do We  Do With Our Freedom? If just 1% of the world's population reclaims just 30 seconds every day, that's 5.8 million hours of human productivity! Per Day! The benefit is not just time and convenience depending on whatever we do with our tech, but paper napkins and energy used to treat, heat, and pump the water that washes trongless fingers when we are prepping food in the kitchen or prior to eating. Granted, we still wash the trong once, at the end of the use event, but that’s twice as good as washing twice, before and after, or the half a dozen times a home cook might during a proper dinner prep.Risks & ChallengesLet's be realistic though; we are asking people to change the way they do something very visceral-eating. We don't have to look that far to see that we humans don't always quickly adopt a new and better way of doing things. But I sincerely think this friction is being lubricated by technology, more specifically the information that we share using technology. We are learning to learn, to adopt new apps, and ways of doing things. Besides, the singularity is on our side. Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you cannot provide funding now, please share with all your friends and everyone else.

<p>After nine months of providing services to the homeless in our community, I've come to the conclusion that we are only touching the periphery of a much bigger problem. What we do, through Clint's Cupboard, is wonderful, providing a meal, toiletries, clothing and a smile, handshake or hug each week. But, we are only able to do this one day per week and reach a limited number of needy folks.</p>
<p>I have talked to many volunteers and donors over the past nine months, regarding what our plans were, to expand our servi<span style=""display: inline;"">ces and outreach in the future. My response has always been that we fit a niche, by providing basic essentials to the homeless, without judgment or prerequisites on their part. After seeing the support we've received from so many wonderful people, I'm convinced that we can continue what we do, and by applying for grants and seeking donations, expand our services. We also look to form alliances with other NGOs and groups that are dedicated to helping solve the homeless problem.</span></p>
<div>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 6px;"">Shelters are everywhere, offering temporary, short-term protection, usually requiring that the premises be vacated during daylight hours.  These shelters are much-needed for immediate protection, however, they also serve to perpetuate the cycle of homelessness.  They do not address the problem, seeking to eradicate it, or drastically reduce it.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

Once protected, I envision moving those who are capable, into permanent housing, where they can receive mental health and addiction counseling.  At that point, we can then provide employment training and job placement, ending the homeless cycle. Even after that, we will continue to counsel, mentor provide support. There are other communities in the country where these services are provided successfully, so we have a roadmap and schematic for creating such a program here. We CAN eliminate hunger in the areas we serve; we CAN eliminate homelessness and we CAN create a vision of hope and opportunity in these same areas. We are creating partnerships with local government leaders, who have given us a commitment of support!</b></span></p>
<p style=""margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;"">With the funds we raise now, we will be forming a non-profit corporation and apply for 501(c)(3) (tax-exempt) status with the IRS. By taking these steps, we can qualify for tax-deductible donations, as well as grants from foundations and organizations. The IRS filing fee is $400 for non-profits with revenues under $50,000 annually. The balance is for filing our corporation documents with the State of Maryland, along with IndieGoGo &amp; PayPal fees.  We are grateful to our attorney who has offered his expertise in working with non-profits, without his regular fees!</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;"">Some say that I am a dreamer...that's probably true; but, without dreams, we can't create better realities! All great change begins with a dream. I hope you will continue to help us turn dreams into reality. Let's harness the love, caring and dedication of those who have helped us create this wonderful community over the past nine months, and continue our commitment to really making a difference.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px;"">As people have heard me say over and over again: ""We can't change the entire world, but we CAN change our own world, where we live, work and play!"" Our children deserve nothing less!</p>

Once protected, I envision moving those who are capable, into permanent housing, where they can receive mental health and addiction counseling.  At that point, we can then provide employment training and job placement, ending the homeless cycle. Even after that, we will continue to counsel, mentor provide support. There are other communities in the country where these services are provided successfully, so we have a roadmap and schematic for creating such a program here. We CAN eliminate hunger in the areas we serve; we CAN eliminate homelessness and we CAN create a vision of hope and opportunity in these same areas. We are creating partnerships with local government leaders, who have given us a commitment of support!
With the funds we raise now, we will be forming a non-profit corporation and apply for 501(c)(3) (tax-exempt) status with the IRS. By taking these steps, we can qualify for tax-deductible donations, as well as grants from foundations and organizations. The IRS filing fee is $400 for non-profits with revenues under $50,000 annually. The balance is for filing our corporation documents with the State of Maryland, along with IndieGoGo & PayPal fees.  We are grateful to our attorney who has offered his expertise in working with non-profits, without his regular fees!
Some say that I am a dreamer...that's probably true; but, without dreams, we can't create better realities! All great change begins with a dream. I hope you will continue to help us turn dreams into reality. Let's harness the love, caring and dedication of those who have helped us create this wonderful community over the past nine months, and continue our commitment to really making a difference.
As people have heard me say over and over again: ""We can't change the entire world, but we CAN change our own world, where we live, work and play!"" Our children deserve nothing less!
It has been a blessing to do this work and to meet all the volunteers who have donated time and resources to our efforts! Any monies raised in excess of our goal will be used to purchase items from our Amazon Wish List for Clint's Cupboard.

 ""Do you understand that climate change threatens to cause the collapse of civilization? Do you have the strength of character to protect the American people from catastrophe? Will you Pledge to lead a World War II-scale mobilization to fight climate change?""

This is what presidential candidates need to be asked. Not whether they believe in climate science! The climate system, our common home, is in acute crisis. This situation demands an all-out, emergency response.

Without a World War II-style Climate Mobilization, human civilization will most certainly collapse this century amidst catastrophic sea level rise, global food and water shortages, and a mass extinction of life on earth. This election season, we must make clear that the presidential candidate who “believes” in climate change yet offers a weak policy response that will not actually solve the problem is hardly better than the climate change denier. 

We can no longer accept the politically fashionable ""carbon gradualism"" that continually kicks the can down the road. Instead, we must demand the response that so many leading environmental analysts and scientists tell us will actually save civilization from climate change — a World War II-scale mobilization! 



America needs heroic political leadership to steer us through the gathering storm of climate change. We need a President who levels with the American people about the gravity of the climate emergency — a President with the courage and competence to mobilize our economy and society in order to eliminate our nation’s net greenhouse gas emissions at wartime speed.

The Climate Mobilization, a growing movement that started last fall, demands that political candidates both publicly recognize that climate change threatens the destruction of civilization and publicly commit to a World War II-scale Climate Mobilization in response. After 10 months of intense movement-building, we are raring to intervene in the Iowa Caucuses and confront presidential candidates with this critical challenge. With your help, we can deploy veteran organizers on the ground in Iowa on that very mission!



Every day, many of the 20 announced candidates for President of the United States are campaigning in Iowa. The national media follows their activities, as well as the political preferences of Iowans, quite closely. (See a recent article on Hillary Clinton getting heckled about climate in New Hampshire, for an example!) 

With your help, we will develop a core of Iowa Mobilizers who will organize their communities and put direct pressure on political candidates to sign the Pledge to Mobilize, catapulting the idea of a WWII-scale, emergency Climate Mobilization into the presidential campaign, the national media, and the mainstream of American politics.The Pledge, a breakthrough organizing strategy, calls for a WWII-scale, full-employment mobilization to eliminate America’s net greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. The Pledge also calls on the U.S. to lead an international effort to restore a safe climate. Citizens who sign the Pledge commit to support candidates who have signed the Pledge with their vote, time, and money, and to spread the Pledge to others.

Ed Fallon, a veteran Iowa lawmaker, radio show host, and climate activist, is ready to enlist in the Climate Mobilization and lead the campaign to mobilize the Iowa Caucuses. He is ready to Mobilize Iowa using the Pledge to Mobilize. But he can’t do it without your help. 

With your support, we can have Ed mobilizing Iowa in a matter of days. To understand what Ed will be doing on the ground in Iowa, you should understand how The Climate Mobilization – and our primary tool, the Pledge to Mobilize – works.

The Iowa caucuses are only seven months away. This may not seem like much time — but the Pledge to Mobilize is a strategy built for rapid growth.

The Pledge is a public acknowledgment that the climate crisis threatens the collapse of civilization, as well as a call for the United States to initiate a WWII-scale mobilization to eliminate our national net greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and enlist in an international effort to restore a safe global climate (Please see The Case for Climate Mobilization for a detailed scientific and economic explanation of these demands). The Pledge also contains a set of political and personal commitments to build the social mobilization required to achieve these demands. 


Join us! Please consider signing the Pledge to Mobilize yourself!
In the ten months
since we launched The Climate Mobilization, the Pledge to Mobilize has been
signed by more than 1800 Americans and international allies, including Ralph
Nader, Winona LaDuke, Citizens' Climate Lobby founder Marshall Saunders,
Rainforest Action Network founder Randy Hayes, Former Greenpeace International executive director Paul Gilding, internationally recognized ecological economist Richard
Heinberg, former congressman Jim Bates, Florida congressional candidate Alina
Valdes, and San Francisco mayoral candidate Amy Farah Weiss (Watch Amy take the Pledge in a public ceremony outside City Hall!).
   We have assembled a Mobilization Advisory Board of top minds across a range of disciplines, including Gilding, Heinberg, and the world-class climatologist Michael E. Mann. We were also recently endorsed by leading climate activists Reverend Lennox Yearwood Jr. and Tom Weis.

Join us! Check out exciting volunteer opportunities within TCM! 

We have also started holding public events! On
June 14th, we held the first ever National Climate Mobilization Day,
with 15 events across the country, as well as in Paris and Playa del Carmen,
Mexico, all demanding all demanding urgent, WWII-scale Climate Mobilization. These events ranged from the simple —spreading the Pledge in a farmers market or a church
coffee hour —to
the elaborate: Rallies were held in Santa Cruz, Washington D.C., and San Diego,
where former congressman Jim Bates reenacted Paul Revere’s
midnight ride in the streets of
San Diego, warning that “climate change is
coming - Mobilize!”  When the congressman
arrived 
in Balboa Park, more than 100 San Diegans
greeted him for a midnight rally.


Ed Fallon is a former Iowa lawmaker, veteran organizer, talk radio host, and accomplished climate activist. Ed was an Iowa state legislator for 14 years from 1993 - 2006, and ran for Governor in 2006, receiving 26% of the vote in the Democratic Primary.
He has a broad and deep network in Iowa, especially among the
climate-alarmed. Ed shares our dedication to the mobilization cause; he has
been referring to the need for a WWII-scale Climate Mobilization for more than
three years! He took the Pledge to Mobilize in May, at an anti-oil sands rally.


Ed is currently the host of The Fallon Forum, a radio show that reaches thousands of independent and commercial radio listeners every week and features Ed’s interviews with Iowa’s civic and religious leaders, presidential candidates, and others.

Ed is also a
dedicated and highly experienced climate organizer. In 2013, he organized the
Great March for Climate Action — an epic, 3,000-mile trek from Los Angeles to
Washington, D.C. In March 2015, he walked 400 miles along the length of the
proposed Bakken Oil Pipeline, rally opposition to the project and building
relationships with hundreds of farmers he met on his journey. The Des
Moines Register’s editorial board characterized him as a “smart fellow” with a
“principled dedication to a cleaner environment.”
Over
the years, Ed has accrued extensive political organizing experience, as well as
a sizable online following that includes Iowans from all walks of life and
across the political spectrum. Ed has an email list of 6,000 Iowans for the
Fallon Forum, and the Fallon Forum site receives 14,000 visitors a month. From
his climate activism work, he has built a national email list of 7,000.


Ed has offered to bring his dedication, expertise, and networks to bear to build a grassroots movement for The Climate Mobilization in Iowa, starting on August 1st.

For $5,000 a month, Ed and his colleague Shari Hrdina will introduce the Pledge to Mobilize to Iowa! They will build a powerful campaign, driven by Iowa voters, pressuring presidential candidates of all parties to sign the Pledge to Mobilize and commit to a WWII-scale Climate Mobilization that drives the American economy to zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2025. 

Ed has had decades of experience using the Iowa Caucuses for advocacy, and has seen the strategy work very well — especially when it is done right. He notes:

“Some advocacy groups make the mistake of
hiring non-Iowans, who then travel the state posing the questions themselves.
After two or three appearances, candidates recognize that person, and everyone — candidate, general public, and the media - stop taking him or her seriously...The value of having the kind of network
we come with is that each question will be asked by somebody who says, ‘Hi, I’m
from here, and I’m going to the Iowa Caucuses on February 1st. I’m concerned
about climate change, and I want to ask you a question.’ This type of grassroots,
bottom-up engagement is what candidates and the media take seriously.”

Ed and Shari will recruit and train at least 50 Iowa Mobilizers who will:



































Hold at least one meeting about TCM in their community


Bird-dog presidential candidates from all parties (with a goal of having volunteers ask pointed questions about the need for a Climate Mobilization at 3 candidate events every week) 


Bring a large-format version of the Pledge to Mobilize to candidate events and talk with attendees about the climate crisis and the Pledge


Recruit and publicize elected officials who agree to sign the Pledge.


Recruit and publicize community
leaders who sign the Pledge in academia, business, religion and other prominent professions.


Recruit 1,000 Iowans in the Climate Mobilization. 


Ed will also promote the Climate Mobilization and the Pledge to Mobilize on his weekly talk show. See Ed and Shari’s 5-page proposal for more specific details explaining how they will mobilize
Iowa.




The Climate Mobilization's success in San Diego demonstrates the power of combining the Pledge with strong local organizing. Nancy and Derek Casady have leveraged their respect in the community and broad networks to spread the Pledge incredibly effectively.



In less than 6 months since taking the Pledge themselves, the Casadys have recruited Bishop George McKinney, Citizens' Climate Lobby founder Marshall Saunders, former congressman Jim Bates and Judge Robert Coates.

</p><p>Our company name gives away the punch line, but let’s pretend you don’t see that huge logo while we take you through this fun little intro. </p>
<h2><span><b>Our Mission</b></span></h2>
<p>We wish to provide the attendees of comic conventions a basic human right that millions of people around the world are denied every single day. This revolutionary endeavor will provide happiness, peace of mind, and energy to all that experience it. This innovation will be a breakthrough in the world of conventions, making the experience better and healthier for ALL attendees, not just those who experience our booth. What is this necessity? What could possibly give the convention a fresh outlook? We are here to pioneer the idea of adults sleeping during the daytime. That’s correct. Naps.</p>
<h2><span><b>Our Vision</b></span></h2><div><span><b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444436588/qe538megui9j0tifsepx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></div><p> <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The whole thing is going to be dripping with satire. Kindergarten nap-time for the Comic Con children-at-heart. </span></p>
<p></p><h2><span><b>Naps? That’s it?</b></span></h2><span>
In addition to this base concept we have been developing several other ideas, some occurring during conventions and some subsidiary projects to carry on throughout the year. </span>
<p>While a nap booth would be our main focus at conventions, we also plan to provide a variety of other services. First, we know the struggle of waiting hours upon hours to see a panel and missing out on experiencing the rest of a convention. Naps wants to provide someone to do that for you! We plan to have eager line-holders at your service, so you can shop for a new light saber and still get a panel seat close enough to smell your favorite famous nerds. Don’t worry, your proxy will be a courteous and entertaining replacement with snacks and games for the other line-goers who weren’t clever enough to employ our services. </p>
<p>An aspect that we are currently working tirelessly to develop is a raffle for exclusive and exciting VIP adventures. Besides helping the world be a little less cranky with an influx of adult napping, PowerNaps! aims to provide patrons with unique fan experiences. We hope to create opportunities for fans to interact with their favorite convention VIPs in ways that make photo-ops look like child’s play - by incorporating actual child’s play. From board games in pillow forts to full-on sleepovers, Naps! is working to bring you revolutionary fan experiences that your friends will never believe (until they see your Instagram posts)! We have chats and emails and meetings and other mumbo jumbo already in motion to make this possible, but your support will help us convince the VIPs that spending a few hours with a bunch of strangers doing strange things is actually a good idea. </p>
<p>
</p><h2><b>Outside of Conventions</b></h2>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444436629/zqmuxmxhjqqi2ameqlse.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Our first major (and most developed) PowerNaps! subsidiary is our podcast, PowerChats! This podcast would include interviews with VIPs in the format of a fun conversation. With this we hope to provide listeners with a unique insight into the lives of the VIPs, something they would not get from a typical interview. We will be looking to you on social media to help us come up with questions and share your stories with our VIPs. Think of it as a weekly, audio, comic-con panel - run by fans. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several other projects that are still in the early stages of planning, so we are not quite ready to share them yet - but we promise not to disappoint! These projects are well worth the wait and the convention world has no idea what’s coming! </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444436755/iqzyvlabiqmvlzrptlyl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><h2><b>Why do we need help? </b></h2>
<p>The road for a start-up is riddled with obstacles and PowerNaps! has been no exception. This business is a work in progress, but in a few short months and with some truly dedicated individuals we have made it here. We have created a strong team that refuses to give up, no matter what struggles we face, and a team that knows when to ask for help. Because of this we humbly come to you, internet, to ask for your support in our crazy endeavors. We built this company for you - in order to bring more happiness, fun, and sleep into your lives. Who wouldn’t want that? Plus, we’ve got some pretty sweet perks (because you know, who doesn’t love a great bribe?), check them out!</p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Early Bird Special!</h1><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>First 50 contributors will receive 10 free nap vouchers !</i><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444436782/khjvcpm9ds1ny47nsgkf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

</p><p>Jiminey Cricket is a native Texan with a slight obsession with her pug, Scout. She enjoys art and history and macarons of all colors. Jimena came up with the idea for Powernaps while the screams of nearby Howler Monkeys kept her from her precious sleep during a backpacking trip in Guatemala. True story.

</div></div>","Our company name gives away the punch line, but let’s pretend you don’t see that huge logo while we take you through this fun little intro. 
Our Mission
We wish to provide the attendees of comic conventions a basic human right that millions of people around the world are denied every single day. This revolutionary endeavor will provide happiness, peace of mind, and energy to all that experience it. This innovation will be a breakthrough in the world of conventions, making the experience better and healthier for ALL attendees, not just those who experience our booth. What is this necessity? What could possibly give the convention a fresh outlook? We are here to pioneer the idea of adults sleeping during the daytime. That’s correct. Naps.
Our Vision The whole thing is going to be dripping with satire. Kindergarten nap-time for the Comic Con children-at-heart. 
Naps? That’s it?
In addition to this base concept we have been developing several other ideas, some occurring during conventions and some subsidiary projects to carry on throughout the year. 
While a nap booth would be our main focus at conventions, we also plan to provide a variety of other services. First, we know the struggle of waiting hours upon hours to see a panel and missing out on experiencing the rest of a convention. Naps wants to provide someone to do that for you! We plan to have eager line-holders at your service, so you can shop for a new light saber and still get a panel seat close enough to smell your favorite famous nerds. Don’t worry, your proxy will be a courteous and entertaining replacement with snacks and games for the other line-goers who weren’t clever enough to employ our services. 
An aspect that we are currently working tirelessly to develop is a raffle for exclusive and exciting VIP adventures. Besides helping the world be a little less cranky with an influx of adult napping, PowerNaps! aims to provide patrons with unique fan experiences. We hope to create opportunities for fans to interact with their favorite convention VIPs in ways that make photo-ops look like child’s play - by incorporating actual child’s play. From board games in pillow forts to full-on sleepovers, Naps! is working to bring you revolutionary fan experiences that your friends will never believe (until they see your Instagram posts)! We have chats and emails and meetings and other mumbo jumbo already in motion to make this possible, but your support will help us convince the VIPs that spending a few hours with a bunch of strangers doing strange things is actually a good idea. 

Outside of Conventions

Our first major (and most developed) PowerNaps! subsidiary is our podcast, PowerChats! This podcast would include interviews with VIPs in the format of a fun conversation. With this we hope to provide listeners with a unique insight into the lives of the VIPs, something they would not get from a typical interview. We will be looking to you on social media to help us come up with questions and share your stories with our VIPs. Think of it as a weekly, audio, comic-con panel - run by fans. 

There are several other projects that are still in the early stages of planning, so we are not quite ready to share them yet - but we promise not to disappoint! These projects are well worth the wait and the convention world has no idea what’s coming! 

Why do we need help? 
The road for a start-up is riddled with obstacles and PowerNaps! has been no exception. This business is a work in progress, but in a few short months and with some truly dedicated individuals we have made it here. We have created a strong team that refuses to give up, no matter what struggles we face, and a team that knows when to ask for help. Because of this we humbly come to you, internet, to ask for your support in our crazy endeavors. We built this company for you - in order to bring more happiness, fun, and sleep into your lives. Who wouldn’t want that? Plus, we’ve got some pretty sweet perks (because you know, who doesn’t love a great bribe?), check them out!Early Bird Special!First 50 contributors will receive 10 free nap vouchers !
Invading the Nerd World
No matter the outcome of this campaign, our team will retain its dedication and love to this project and we can guarantee that PowerNaps! is coming to a convention near you. See you soon, fellow nerds!Our Team

<p>Pastor Girton pitched a tent in the heart of one of Indianapolis’ most violent communities in our city. His street campaign resides at the corner of 30th Street and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street for thirty days. The goal is three-fold:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To raise awareness of the senseless violence</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> that is impacting families (generations) throughout the city of Indianapolis;</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">encourage unity</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">. Pastor G invites city, faith and business leaders, along with survivors and victims of violent crimes to meet in the tent and bring ideas to unite to face the root causes of violence and to show a force of unity by saying #EnoughIsEnough and that it’s time to Unite For Change;</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">initiate a proposal to construct an epicenter of empowerment and education</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> in the northwest community intended to coordinate programming throughout challenged Indianapolis communities where violence and hopelessness is common. (Goal: $500,000)</span><br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our financial goal is aggressive, yet critical to the future of our north Indianapolis community. We're setting a goal of $500,000 to secure the property on the corner where the tent campaign is located. The church currently owns the property, however, an aging inner-city congregation and dwindling membership has made it nearly impossible to keep as a support for the future vision of their incoming pastor, Pastor G. The property is currently for sale and could fall into the hands of exactly what the community doesn't need such as a liquor store or check cashing establishment. Alternatively, Pastor G wishes to construct an Epicenter of Empowerment &amp; Education that will benefit the future growth and viability of the entire community.</p>
<p>Depending on the level of giving, donors could receive:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Recognition on the Unite For Change Memorial Wall of Change</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">UniteForChange.org T-Shirt</span><br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As of this writing, Indianapolis is on pace to match a record number of homicides in our city since 2008. Poverty in Indy has increased at a rate higher than the national average. Poverty among our children in low income homes is higher in impoverished communities in Indianapolis than in more affluent communities. We have an opportunity to turn this around by providing creative, community-based solutions such as:</p> <ul> <li>Job skills resources and training</li>
<li>Parenting skills and education</li>
<li>GED and HSED Program assistance</li>
<li>Advocacy at the local and state level</li>
<li>Increased support to educational resources such as 21st Century Scholars</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>#UniteForChange and help give #EnoughIsEnough as much visibility as possible. Pastor G is asking that you do at least one of the following:</p>

<p></p></div>","Summary 
Pastor Girton pitched a tent in the heart of one of Indianapolis’ most violent communities in our city. His street campaign resides at the corner of 30th Street and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street for thirty days. The goal is three-fold:



To raise awareness of the senseless violence that is impacting families (generations) throughout the city of Indianapolis;


To encourage unity. Pastor G invites city, faith and business leaders, along with survivors and victims of violent crimes to meet in the tent and bring ideas to unite to face the root causes of violence and to show a force of unity by saying #EnoughIsEnough and that it’s time to Unite For Change;


To initiate a proposal to construct an epicenter of empowerment and education in the northwest community intended to coordinate programming throughout challenged Indianapolis communities where violence and hopelessness is common. (Goal: $500,000)


   What We Need & What You Get Our financial goal is aggressive, yet critical to the future of our north Indianapolis community. We're setting a goal of $500,000 to secure the property on the corner where the tent campaign is located. The church currently owns the property, however, an aging inner-city congregation and dwindling membership has made it nearly impossible to keep as a support for the future vision of their incoming pastor, Pastor G. The property is currently for sale and could fall into the hands of exactly what the community doesn't need such as a liquor store or check cashing establishment. Alternatively, Pastor G wishes to construct an Epicenter of Empowerment & Education that will benefit the future growth and viability of the entire community.
Depending on the level of giving, donors could receive:



Recognition on the Unite For Change Memorial Wall of Change

  The Impact As of this writing, Indianapolis is on pace to match a record number of homicides in our city since 2008. Poverty in Indy has increased at a rate higher than the national average. Poverty among our children in low income homes is higher in impoverished communities in Indianapolis than in more affluent communities. We have an opportunity to turn this around by providing creative, community-based solutions such as:  Job skills resources and training
Parenting skills and education
GED and HSED Program assistance
Advocacy at the local and state level
Increased support to educational resources such as 21st Century Scholars


    Other Ways You Can Help 

#UniteForChange and help give #EnoughIsEnough as much visibility as possible. Pastor G is asking that you do at least one of the following:


Post UniteForChange.org messages, testimonies and ideas to end the violence in our community to our Facebook page: www.facebook.com/cmbc.org


Tweet about the UniteForChange.org unity campaign using #EnoughIsEnough #UniteForChange


Advocate for media coverage and send to any bloggers in your network


Use your social media accounts and off-line contacts and partner coalitions to organize unifying actions/messages, etc.

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>We've had several people ask us for ways that they can support our business. We are humbled to have phenomenal clients that are aware of the frailty of the local small business.</p>
<p>Large corporations have millions and billions of dollars in assets and the ability to hire lobbyists to convince the government to bail them out.</p>
<p>But small businesses operate on very small margins and can be gone in an instant.</p>
<p>I have hesitated to start a campaign as I don't wish to ask for handouts from people who are also struggling with job loss, quarantine, and other difficulties during this crazy time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Are you asking for a handout?</h3>
<p>Absolutely not. We are responding our customers that have asked for an additional way to show their support.</p>

<p>You can order bags of coffee online at <a href=""https://ninjawarrior.coffee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ninjawarrior.coffee</a> and, as it has been for 3 years, you can get delivery here in Easley.</p>
<p>This campaign is a way that you can overpay for those same things... :-)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How this helps</h3>
<p>As any small business, we have overhead and responsibilities. We desire to provide a quality product with great customer service for a fair price.</p>
<p>This campaign is for people who wish to show their support in helping us meet those needs by paying a price that is higher than normal to help us offset our overhead.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>We’re traditional</strong>. We’re trying to go back to the basics to bring the real spirit of Christmas all year round. We want future generations to be able to grow up knowing that magical feeling of a toy train driving around its tracks underneath a 7-foot evergreen. We want our store (both online and local) to be able to reconnect with community. <strong>Community is our main focus.</strong></p>
<p>We want our customers to know that we care about them and we are so thankful that they took the time out of their day to experience what we have worked so hard to create for them. We’ll get to know each and every one of our local customers at our small coffee shop where the community can reconnect with each other and grow old together just as community should be.</p>
<p>Whether you’re browsing through our multitude of unique and timeless products, or you’re sipping a nice hot cup of coffee, we want to be able to give you that magical feeling of Christmas as soon as you pull up into our lot. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>We already have the means to continue our online sales BUT we have huge dreams.</p>
<p>Prince Edward Island is one of the most beautiful places in the entire world, not just because of its breathtaking scenery, but also because of its people. The communities on our little island are some of the most, old fashioned, down to earth, caring bunch you’ll ever meet. We would be silly to not try to physically implement that dream and desire into our small town. </p>
<p><br/>Our names are Abbey and Kerri Thomson (The mother daughter duo) and for years we’ve dreamed about opening our very own Christmas Store. <strong>Specifically, we’ve always dreamed for a traditional Christmas store on Prince Edward Island</strong>. We have been beyond blessed to have been relocated back to our home province where generations of family have lived before, now the only thing left to make the last part of our dream come true is the building. </p>
<p><br/>Kerri established the online “<strong>Star &amp; Stable Christmas Store</strong>” back in 2017 while at the same time Abbey created her own business “<strong>The Freehand Artisan</strong>”. Both businesses produced handmade signs (Custom and general designs) as well as traditional Christmas décor. It wasn’t until a year or two later that we teamed up and started a layout for our first physical shop. We have the opportunity to build right in our own home!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/><strong>The next step in accomplishing this dream is the finances which is why we’re asking for your help.</strong>  </p>
<p>We’re always keeping everything we do community centered which means that as a thank you for your support we’re doing many different giveaways to keep life exciting and also to show how much we appreciate you.</p>
<p>We also have our own YouTube channel where we’re going to post weekly vlogs and updates so we can make sure that you are all with us every step of the way. We’re also going to be filming for years to come to allow the ones who can’t necessarily be with us in person to feel like they’re a part of our community. Also stay up to date with our progress and our messages to you through our social media pages (Facebook and Instagram) where we will be posting regularly as well as doing interactive lives to answer any of your questions as well as get some ideas of what you’d like to see us bring into the store. </p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's always excitement around launching new ideas. It's even more exciting to have people partner with you, but launching businesses and ideas is hard work and requires a lot of effort, interaction, permits, applications, construction, marketing and communication. That's why we need your help! We appreciate any help and support you can provide. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We realize that not everyone can give financially. That's ok! You can support us simply by sharing our posts, encouraging others to give on social media and just participating in community. </p>
<p>We appreciate you and thank you for taking an interest in the success of Star &amp; Stable Christmas Store.</p>

Also stay up to date with our progress and our messages to you through our social media pages (Facebook and Instagram) where we will be posting regularly as well as doing interactive lives to answer any of your questions as well as get some ideas of what you’d like to see us bring into the store. 
 
Risks & Challenges
There's always excitement around launching new ideas. It's even more exciting to have people partner with you, but launching businesses and ideas is hard work and requires a lot of effort, interaction, permits, applications, construction, marketing and communication. That's why we need your help! We appreciate any help and support you can provide. 

Other Ways You Can Help
We realize that not everyone can give financially. That's ok! You can support us simply by sharing our posts, encouraging others to give on social media and just participating in community. 
We appreciate you and thank you for taking an interest in the success of Star & Stable Christmas Store.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p> Food Without A Face began when I started the vegan transition 2 years ago.  I realised there was a definite lack of help for people who were looking to become plant based and so I started to develop an idea for an app that would give people directions to the nearest vegan friendly business no matter where they were in the world.</p>
<p>I've always loved food and I'm not a salad eating kind of person, so what really appeals to me are the foods that vegans would normally miss - scrambled ""eggs"", meat free bacon and burgers, chunky wraps and, most importantly, good coffee and cake!</p>
<p>With that in mind, having sampled a lot of what the area has to offer, I've noticed a distinct lack of vegan friendly businesses near where I live and along the coast of the North East of Scotland.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What makes your cafe so special?</strong></p>
<p>Aside from being the only vegan cafe for miles, FWAF will have several special features:</p>
<p><u>Eco Friendly Practices</u>: electricity will be supplied by renewable energy companies; food will be served in recycled packaging that is also compostable; we will push for an electric car charging point in the car park and discount will be available to those driving electric vehicles; recycled plastic coffee cups will be sold that will discourage the use of disposable cups; recycling bins will be available in store</p>
<p><u>Vegan Comfort Food</u>:  yes, there will be healthy options.  But my goal is to encourage EVERYONE to eat here, not just vegans!  In order to attract omnivores and show them just how great our food can be, there will be all sorts of tasty stuff available - maybe even some Cullen Skink!</p>
<p><u>Dog Friendly</u>:  as a crazy dog lady, I absolutely 100% will encourage you ALL to bring your dog friends after your walks.  There will be snacks and water waiting for them!</p>
<p><u>Bird Friendly Coffee</u>: as a place that promotes kindness to all living creatures, it would be wrong to ignore the impact that coffee farming has on our feathered friends.  With that in mind, all of our coffee will aim to come from companies that are certified Bird Friendly - coffee is grown in the shade, meaning that the combination of foliage cover, tree height and animal diversity provides suitable migratory bird habitat while maintaining productive farms. Producers must be recertified every three years to ensure they continue to meet these requirements and can truly call themselves Bird Friendly.</p>
<p><u>Creative Space For Hire</u>: whether you run a camera club, an art group or even just want to meet here before heading out with your running group, the space will be available for people to hire for a small charge.  </p>
<p><strong>What will it be like?</strong></p>
<p>The aim for this coffee shop is to be unlike anything else in the area.  The interior will be relaxing and warm with upcycled furniture, comfy seating and lots of cool artwork by local artists.</p>
<p>There will be shelves of vegan friendly products that you can purchase to take home and we will also be running community events every now and again.</p>

I've done a lot of things in my life: hairstylist, gymnastics coach, retail manager, business consultant, and for the past 7 years, I've taught yoga. Opening a studio has been a long-time dream of mine. I feel so lucky to have reached the point where this dream is manifesting into reality. I can’t wait to share the studio and the benefits of adventure yoga with you all. Thank you for participating in the Just Be Well Yoga community.</p>

<p>“I love all of the folks at Just Be Well Yoga. Amanda the owner brings a playful attitude to her yoga practice. Her classes are full of dynamic movement and are complemented well by the other instructors' unique styles. All classes are accessible to all skill levels, even Acro Yoga! I have made so many great friends through Just Be Well Yoga. Can't recommend checking out this studio highly enough!! PS don't be scared to come solo to an Acro session - no partner required!” – Cait longtime student and Pharmacy Professor</p>

<h3>Adventure Yoga Facility</h3>
<p><strong>Just Be Well Yoga is a full-service yoga studio with intimate class sizes for more individualized attention and private or semiprivate sessions.</strong> JBWYoga represents my ideals for a yoga studio: beautiful, hardwood floors, a well-lit space with natural light streaming in, 16’ high ceilings, climate control, and a wide variety of props.</p>
<p><strong>And at the top of the prop list: aerial yoga hammocks!</strong> Aerial Yoga is used for a variety of purposes including releasing tension in the spine and deepening standing poses, twists, backbends, and restorative poses.</p>
<p><strong>Just Be Well Yoga will provide daily classes covering alignment vinyasa, strength, mobility, vinyin, acro, and aerial; monthly, 2-3 hour, workshops on specific themes and topics; quarterly weekend workshops. During warmer months we will provide weekly SUP yoga classes, monthly full moon SUP meditations, annual SUP yoga teacher training and retreats.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What is Adventure Yoga?</strong></h3>
<p>Adventure Yoga is a mix of different yoga styles to deepen your asana practice by bringing it into different avenues. Taking yoga from the traditional vinyasa and hatha practice and adding various props like yoga wheels, aerial hammocks, paddle boards, and partners all give your practice a little more sense of adventure.</p>
<p>We have found a well rounded practice inspired by the traditional styles of alignment yoga and adding these props allows students to find more balance, strength, and playfulness in their practice.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518314262/qdgg08qp2ncltizdpj30.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Not only have we combined these modern yoga practices, but even more unconventional classes like black light flows and lunar meditations has helped our students find that childlike playfulness that is often missing in our adult lives.</p>
<h3><strong>What we need:</strong></h3>
<p>The costs of modifying a preexisting space into a functioning yoga studio can really add up. We can see the potential in the space, but there’s quite a bit that needs to be done.</p>
<p>In order to make Just Be Well Yoga the adventure environment we’re looking for, I need to add the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>FLOORING</strong> – Flooring will be installed in the studio, providing a solid, sturdy, beautiful foundation for our adventures.</li>
<li>
<strong>AERIAL YOGA </strong>–  Rigging supplies and hammocks themselves. All components of the Aerial Rigs are assembled for precision and safety. We will need to hire a structural engineer as well as a professional rigger to assist with initial installation.</li>
<li>
<strong>LIGHTING</strong> – We’re increasing the natural light by adding a clear ceiling roof panel. Dimmable lighting allows us to control the light as needed for different classes.</li>
<li>
<strong>WALLS</strong> – As an old warehouse building some insulation and drywall still needs to be hung in order to reduce any noise from our neighbors and outside as well as to help maintain a comfortable temperature in the studio space.</li>
<li>
<strong>PAINT</strong> – the interior of the space will need a clean coat of paint to make our studio as welcoming as possible. We are also looking to finish the stairs leading up to the studio space with a durable paint.</li>
<li>
<strong>PROPS AND RESOURCES</strong> – Props, props, and more props! On top of existing props we will add a full set of Yoga Wheels, a few sets of handstand canes, blocks, handstand wedges, and a set of wooden stall bars.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of these aspects on their own is cheap, but taken together they become truly costly.  We want to provide the already existing Fort Worth yoga community with the best possible adventure yoga facility and are asking for your help to make this dream a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Here's how you can help:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Choose your perk!</strong></p>
<p>We're offering a wide variety of packages so you can try out the studio and see what Just Be Well Yoga can do for your health and wellness. Look over the perks and see which is right for you. </p>

I’ve read every brewing book I could get my hands on, listened to hundreds of hours of brewing podcasts and, of course, brewed my ass off. I was lucky enough to have support from friends and family when I needed equipment upgrades or honest feedback. I was also lucky to get a jump into the professional brewing world. I learned about commercial bottling and event planning in the three years I worked at Fountain Square Brewing in Indianapolis. Daredevil brewing company gave me the opportunity to expand my commercial brewing knowledge by letting me apprentice brew. I learned large scale brewing, proper cleaning and sanitation of commercial equipment, canning beer, kegging beer, cleaning kegs (lots of kegs), and the level of work it takes to make beer on the professional level. Most importantly, I learned how to make consistent, quality beer.<br/><br/>I started to enter competitions and fairly quickly saw results. In 2015, I placed 2nd in the Upland Brewery UpCup competition. In 2016, my stout placed 2nd in the first round of the national homebrew competition, and later in 2016, my stout took gold in the Indiana State Fair Brewer’s cup, then went on to beat 349 other brewers who entered 849 other beers to take home Best in Show in the Brewer’s cup.<br/><br/>I’m ready to start making beer for you and turn this love of the beer industry I have into my career.<br/><br/><strong>About Heather</strong><br/>Heather spent the first half of her working life in the food and restaurant industry, spending time as a produce clerk, server, bartender, and finally restaurant manager.

<h3>What Shezmu Cellars Means to Us</h3>
<p>We grew up in rural Kentucky only a few miles from the home place of Bill Monroe, The Father of Bluegrass Music.  Hillbilly may be an accurate descriptor of how we grew up hunting to fill our freezer and visiting neighbors on horseback; but the poverty line be damned because we were rich in the love of our parents and each other. Since we can remember, we were taught to value  family, and specifically our brotherly bond, more than anything because “one day your brother will be all you have.” Unfortunately, that day got a little closer when our father passed last year from lung problems. </p>
<p>In the wake of dad’s passing, we spoke a lot on what life looks like going forward. We concluded that Adam shouldn’t be risking his own health as an underground coal miner. Further, we would like to build something for the people we care about. As Cody was already an award winning craft whiskey distiller, we decided to build a winery/meadery. </p>
<p>Quickly, that simple decision grew into an expression of our desire to add value to the world around us. <strong>With Shezmu Cellars we will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Save the pollinators</strong> (we are partial to bees) as they are currently under attack from agricultural progress.</li>
<li>
<strong>Support and implement safe transportation</strong> programs for our surrounding community because too many lives are damaged by drunk driving.</li>
<li>Experiment with pay structures and benefits packages to help <strong>change the service industry </strong>for the better.</li>
<li>Most importantly, we will be able to express our belief that a company is the most responsible link in the social chain by <strong>taking care of our community and our employees</strong>.</li>
<li>While we do all of this, of course, we will continue to <strong>produce tasty, award-wining beverages</strong>!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Will Succeed (Bullet Point Version)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Already have over 3 years of successful industry experience</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Great products</strong> <ul>
<li>Mead - Focusing on lower proof and less sweet (wine or beer like)</li>
<li>Wine - Georgia and California wines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>30 beer taps</strong> from day one featuring various local craft beers</li>
<li>Across the street from KSU: Marietta and down the road from Lockheed Martin and Dobbins Air Force Base (<strong>yay student and military discounts!</strong>)</li>
<li>Partnership with recently awarded <strong>#1 amber honey in America, Hometown Honey</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Free weekend shuttle</strong> between Shezmu Cellars and 3 other craft alcohol manufacturers</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>We need $10,000 to help put the finishing touches on our concept and get us through some initial deposits and fees to opening.</strong> Of course, the more we can raise here, the better our initial opening will be so don't stop at 10k let's do this like we mead it! </p>
<p>When we designed our perks we wanted to maximize YOUR value. Sure, we have some amazing gear like the Koozies, but we wanted to include straight up house cash to really make it worth your while! <strong>House Cash is a gift card good in store and online... and yes we will be shipping our beverages!</strong> To stretch out that house cash, <strong>all backers will receive 10% off any purchase at Shezmu Cellars through December 2019! </strong></p>
<p>Then we got creative and decided we'd love to make alcohol with you so we decided to host <strong>private winemaking sessions</strong> where you create a recipe and execute it alongside us. Of course, we need seating so if getting your name engraved on a permanent fixture is more your style, you should <strong>sponsor a bar stool or table</strong>! </p>
<p>OH! <strong>All backers</strong> from the $100 level and up <strong>will be invited to our exclusive soft opening</strong> for early access to Shezmu Cellars!</p>
<p>These last two are our favorites, though. They include a <strong>Pharaoh Club Membership</strong> which is our version of a wine club, but better! It's lifetime and carries with it a permanent discount, exclusive member events, and quarterly wine/beer shipments!</p>
<p>The final perk is the <strong>private event</strong> and is really just our excuse to help you show off to as many of your closest friends as you want!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute and we get that, but that doesn't mean you can't help! We need your help spreading the word. <strong>Use the hashtag #LikeYouMeadIt</strong> anytime you're posting! Talk us up to your friends and see if they even know what mead is.</p>
<p>If you want perks without backing,<strong> create an Indiegogo account and use the share tools</strong> to help us make some noise about Shezmu Cellars and this campaign. <strong>We are tracking the people who generate the most money through sharing and they will get gear and house cash!</strong></p>

</div></div>","What Shezmu Cellars Means to Us
We grew up in rural Kentucky only a few miles from the home place of Bill Monroe, The Father of Bluegrass Music.  Hillbilly may be an accurate descriptor of how we grew up hunting to fill our freezer and visiting neighbors on horseback; but the poverty line be damned because we were rich in the love of our parents and each other. Since we can remember, we were taught to value  family, and specifically our brotherly bond, more than anything because “one day your brother will be all you have.” Unfortunately, that day got a little closer when our father passed last year from lung problems. 
In the wake of dad’s passing, we spoke a lot on what life looks like going forward. We concluded that Adam shouldn’t be risking his own health as an underground coal miner. Further, we would like to build something for the people we care about. As Cody was already an award winning craft whiskey distiller, we decided to build a winery/meadery. 
Quickly, that simple decision grew into an expression of our desire to add value to the world around us. With Shezmu Cellars we will:


Save the pollinators (we are partial to bees) as they are currently under attack from agricultural progress.

Support and implement safe transportation programs for our surrounding community because too many lives are damaged by drunk driving.
Experiment with pay structures and benefits packages to help change the service industry for the better.
Most importantly, we will be able to express our belief that a company is the most responsible link in the social chain by taking care of our community and our employees.
While we do all of this, of course, we will continue to produce tasty, award-wining beverages!


Why We Will Succeed (Bullet Point Version)

Already have over 3 years of successful industry experience

Great products 
Mead - Focusing on lower proof and less sweet (wine or beer like)
Wine - Georgia and California wines



30 beer taps from day one featuring various local craft beers
Across the street from KSU: Marietta and down the road from Lockheed Martin and Dobbins Air Force Base (yay student and military discounts!)
Partnership with recently awarded #1 amber honey in America, Hometown Honey


Free weekend shuttle between Shezmu Cellars and 3 other craft alcohol manufacturers

What We Need & What You Get
We need $10,000 to help put the finishing touches on our concept and get us through some initial deposits and fees to opening. Of course, the more we can raise here, the better our initial opening will be so don't stop at 10k let's do this like we mead it! 
When we designed our perks we wanted to maximize YOUR value. Sure, we have some amazing gear like the Koozies, but we wanted to include straight up house cash to really make it worth your while! House Cash is a gift card good in store and online... and yes we will be shipping our beverages! To stretch out that house cash, all backers will receive 10% off any purchase at Shezmu Cellars through December 2019! 
Then we got creative and decided we'd love to make alcohol with you so we decided to host private winemaking sessions where you create a recipe and execute it alongside us. Of course, we need seating so if getting your name engraved on a permanent fixture is more your style, you should sponsor a bar stool or table! 
OH! All backers from the $100 level and up will be invited to our exclusive soft opening for early access to Shezmu Cellars!
These last two are our favorites, though. They include a Pharaoh Club Membership which is our version of a wine club, but better! It's lifetime and carries with it a permanent discount, exclusive member events, and quarterly wine/beer shipments!
The final perk is the private event and is really just our excuse to help you show off to as many of your closest friends as you want!

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute and we get that, but that doesn't mean you can't help! We need your help spreading the word. Use the hashtag #LikeYouMeadIt anytime you're posting! Talk us up to your friends and see if they even know what mead is.
If you want perks without backing, create an Indiegogo account and use the share tools to help us make some noise about Shezmu Cellars and this campaign. We are tracking the people who generate the most money through sharing and they will get gear and house cash!

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>How will NOPE do this?</b></p>
<p>NOPE will do this through a range of micro-nutrient powders
(MNPs) that are especially formulated to tackle key micro-nutrient deficiencies
such as vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and iron deficiency. The unique thing about
these MNPs is that they’ll also add to the caloric intake needs by providing an
adequate energy supply. This will serve to ensure both caloric and
micro-nutrient needs are equally met.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Is there a need for NOPE?</b><br/></p>
<p>Yes, there is a crucial need for MNP programmes like NOPE. This
is because there are currently over 800 million people who are suffering from chronic
states of under-nutrition, hidden hunger and severe acute malnutrition.  What this means is that all of these hundreds
of millions of people are unable to get the caloric energy and micronutrients
they need in order to achieve optimal health.</p>
<p><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></b></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Well in this context what is meant by optimal health is being
freed from the adverse health effects caused by poor nutritional uptake, what
could also be described as nutritional deprivation.</span></p>

<p><b>Just what are these adverse health effects?</b></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Who are most susceptible to these micronutrient deficiency
disorders?</b></p>
<p>The very poorest members of societies in the developing
world are the most likely to end up with one of these micronutrient deficiency
disorders. Most of these affected individuals are made up of infants, young
children and females, simply because they are the least economically empowered
members of society. These conditions can however be
easily prevented through the right nutritional interventions. NOPE wants to do
just that. The money will be put into developing and providing MNPs tailored
toward infants, young children, expecting mothers and young woman.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What will these MNPs do?</b></p>
<p>Each MNP will contain a mixture of micro-nutrients that are not
being appropriately sourced from an often limited diet. These key
micro-nutrients will be packaged to tackle crucial issues such as vitamin A,
folic acid, zinc, iron, iodine deficiencies, as these can have

</div></div>","Introductions
Hello! Firstly, I would like to
thank you for coming onto my campaign page before formally introducing myself.
My name is Senay, I am a Human Nutrition B.Sc. holder with a passion for all
things nutrition and vegan.

I want to take this passion for
nutrition of mine and educational background and put it into good use. What I want do with it
is start up an NGO that will be geared toward tackling under-and-malnutrition
in the developing world. 
If you, like myself, think it’s
about time nutritional deprivation was completely eradicated then help me get
NOPE off the ground by contributing toward my campaign.
What is the NOPE campaign all about?
NOPE, which stands for Nutritional Optimisation Programme, is
an NGO in the making that will be aimed at tackling malnutrition, under-nutrition
and a phenomenon known as hidden hunger.



How will NOPE do this?
NOPE will do this through a range of micro-nutrient powders
(MNPs) that are especially formulated to tackle key micro-nutrient deficiencies
such as vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and iron deficiency. The unique thing about
these MNPs is that they’ll also add to the caloric intake needs by providing an
adequate energy supply. This will serve to ensure both caloric and
micro-nutrient needs are equally met.

Is there a need for NOPE?
Yes, there is a crucial need for MNP programmes like NOPE. This
is because there are currently over 800 million people who are suffering from chronic
states of under-nutrition, hidden hunger and severe acute malnutrition.  What this means is that all of these hundreds
of millions of people are unable to get the caloric energy and micronutrients
they need in order to achieve optimal health.

What is meant by optimal health?
Well in this context what is meant by optimal health is being
freed from the adverse health effects caused by poor nutritional uptake, what
could also be described as nutritional deprivation.

Just what are these adverse health effects?




Who are most susceptible to these micronutrient deficiency
disorders?
The very poorest members of societies in the developing
world are the most likely to end up with one of these micronutrient deficiency
disorders. Most of these affected individuals are made up of infants, young
children and females, simply because they are the least economically empowered
members of society. These conditions can however be
easily prevented through the right nutritional interventions. NOPE wants to do
just that. The money will be put into developing and providing MNPs tailored
toward infants, young children, expecting mothers and young woman.

What will these MNPs do?
Each MNP will contain a mixture of micro-nutrients that are not
being appropriately sourced from an often limited diet. These key
micro-nutrients will be packaged to tackle crucial issues such as vitamin A,
folic acid, zinc, iron, iodine deficiencies, as these can have
devastating effects.



How much will all of this cost?
NOPE will need £50,000 to formulate its range of micro-nutrient
powders (MNPs) that could be used to fortify and supplement the nutrient and
caloric supply of the nutritionally deprived. £50,000 would get the
programme up and running for 12 months. 
The programme will firstly target a specific country such as
Cambodia, where malnutrition affects 40% of all under 5 year olds, before
expanding its operations. The Programme aims to produce enough MNPs in the
first year to cater for a thousand people throughout the year. 

What are the risks & challenges?
All of the money raised will go toward designing and producing
the MNPs, getting NOPE up and running, marketing and promotion, as well as
making sure contingencies are in place. All of this will be very challenging
and quite difficult to achieve without a healthy dose of perseverance and
belief in the cause. However, you can rest assured I have the passion and
dedication to make this work. 

Costs Analysis:
· 
MNP design & production (£20k)
· 
NOPE registration & start-up (£15k)
· 
Marketing & promotion (£5k)
· 
Contingencies (£10k)

Conclusion
So if you want to invest in a cause that will pay dividends in terms of
building social capital, through a much needed and effective programme, then
please consider  funding NOPE. It will specifically be geared toward the demographics
that need it most and produce tangible results.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div></div>","Hi, my name is Kyo Pang and I was born and raised in Malaysia. I'm here to introduce you to my store, Kopitiam. Kopitiam will be the Traditional Malaysian Coffee House at 51B, Canal Street, on Lower East Side in Manhattan, New York. We specialized in traditional Baba Nyonya cuisine & beverage, which also is one of the oldest traditions in Malaysia. Our delicacies are very colorful, flavorful and visionally exciting. On top of that, we do not use any additive. Just like in the old days, we use natural ingredients, such as flowers and leaves to create the colors and flavors of the treats that we carefully handcrafted. Nevertheless, in order to maintain the authenticity of the taste, most of the ingredients we used were carefully handled and shipped all the way from Malaysia. Many people might not know what does ""Baba Nyonya""actually means. Baba-Nyonya are terms that were used for the descendants of the 15th through 17th century Chinese immigrants to the British Malaya. ""Baba"" referred to men and ""Nyonya"" referred to women.

Since women took the major responsibilities in the cookings, Nyonyas (women) were well known for a wide variety of traditional street foods and cake (kuih).                Unfortunately, Baba Nyonya cuisine is a fading tradition because the preparation process is so delicate and very time consuming.

<p>The community's response to Hopscotch: Cakes + Confections location inside Art Mart has been amazing and now we are ready to move baking operations from the Art Mart location to a beautiful rehabilitated historic location at 802 West John Street in Champaign. We have secured financing for the commercial kitchen build-out and now we are working on the finishing touches to make the shop an even more special and unique experience for our customers. </p>
<p>The building has been a hallmark of the neighborhood for nearly 100 years and the old ""dietary store,"" as it has been for the last 50 years, needs a bit of love to bring it back up to snuff. Depending on your time in the neighborhood you may remember it as ""Kelsey's"" or even ""Gallian's."" We plan to pay homage to the building and its history with your help. </p>
<p><strong>​What Are You Funding?</strong></p>
<p>With the funding we receive we will be able to create a space that is not only beautiful, but also organized and functional. This will support increased potential for long-term success and growth for our business and, in turn, will contribute to a thriving neighborhood community. Additionally, it is most important to us that our customers have a unique, positive experience in our shop and each of these items will contribute to a more streamlined and beautiful shopping experience for everyone who walks through the door at Hopscotch.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are very grateful to have secured a loan and we are using our savings for our shop's build-out costs, but there is a lot more that goes into opening a bakery/shop than just building the walls, purchasing and installing the windows, doors, cabinets, counters and sinks and sourcing high-quality refrigeration. </p>

<h3>I'm Martha - Kokolita is my nickname. It was a pink round cookie that apparently I resembled a lot as a kid :)</h3>
<p>After a rough child hood and an even rougher teenage life full of challenges, being a teen mom among many other things. I finally got a grip on my life. I got a job in retail and climbed that ladder and started a family. In getting ready for black Friday I completed my duties and let my boss know I'd be taking a few days to tend to my 4 month old. Her response: ""You need to get your priorities straight. How will you take care of your family without a job"". My response: A resignation letter and a plan to open my own shop that not only made killer unique products, but an important mission - Feed the hungry, help single parents, help the children, help youth in addiction recovery, show hope for victims of abuse! - Prove to them that there is hope and possibilities out there is you are will to go for them!</p>
<p>Kokolita's was born and the grand opening was on 11/11/11, which was also Veterans day...another cause to support. From my little shop over the last 5 years we have helped over 8,000 deserving people make their lives better.</p>
<p>With your contributions we will reach the next level as a business and it will blow up that number from 8,000 to 800,000 to 8,000,000 one day. It will amplify our Mission's Success: ""change the world, feed the needy, one treat at a time"". With your contribution YOU get to be the change the world. YOU become a part of that 8 million. We can't do it without YOU!!</p>
<p>Here's the opportunity we have in front of us... </p>
<p>We worked long and hard and got a connection to the buyers for COSTCO. We were invited to demonstrate our empanadas in their test kitchen at their corporate office. They LOVED them and just like that we got the opportunity to sell them raw in the frozen section to the public at select COSTCO stores.</p>
<p>After lots of research and the proven track record of frozen items sold, we realized that this opportunity will make all the time and energy my family and I have sacrificed, the many nights they had to go to work with me worth it for their futures and for all the people we help through our little company. But to make it happen we needed a plan...</p>
<p>Here's the plan: We need to raise 85 thousand dollars! - We have to have walk in freezers and refrigerators installed. That alone will cost about 30 thousand. We have to purchase packaging, not only food grade but freezer safe, because the empanadas have meat in them.  I need to get my kitchen USDA certified as well as pass the COSTCO audit process. Here we're talking about another 12 thousand. Then we have the first run of payroll, ingredients, production and climate controlled transportation to the warehouses. We also have to produce the items we are giving away with pledges. Based on the quotes we have received this will be another 30 thousand.  We have also been in business long enough to know that things come up a long the way, so we knew that raising the exact amount would be unproductive and leave us unable to finish what we have started. If we don't reach our complete goal we will do what we can with what we get, starting with fulfilling the items promised to YOU, our awesome contributors! Then installing the walk in freezers and of course the work we have to go through for the COSTCO audit.</p>
<p>When all this hard work becomes reality we will continue to make an impact on this world they way we know how... Together through this project we will help more single parents, feed more homeless, give youth in recovery of addiction something else to fixate on through our classes and even employment. We will create jobs while creating a great quality product which is a MUCH healthier option than most frozen food items available on those shelves today!</p>
<p>After 5 years we have gone though the ups and downs. We have thrived through a recession and we have built a strong brand. We have helped 8,000 deserving people and we have known what it's like to deal with government agencies and employment turnover. I'm so thankful for the management experience I obtained for the 10 years I did it. It helped so much.</p>
<p>Any contribution is totally appreciated! We will update you on what's coming and what's left to do a long the way. We will give you the coolest thank you gifts as promised in the packages. And if you can't contribute - no problem!! if you could just take the time to watch the video and share, share, share it. You would not only be impacting me and my kids - but more importantly the thousands of people in need!</p>

</div></div>","I'm Martha - Kokolita is my nickname. It was a pink round cookie that apparently I resembled a lot as a kid :)
After a rough child hood and an even rougher teenage life full of challenges, being a teen mom among many other things. I finally got a grip on my life. I got a job in retail and climbed that ladder and started a family. In getting ready for black Friday I completed my duties and let my boss know I'd be taking a few days to tend to my 4 month old. Her response: ""You need to get your priorities straight. How will you take care of your family without a job"". My response: A resignation letter and a plan to open my own shop that not only made killer unique products, but an important mission - Feed the hungry, help single parents, help the children, help youth in addiction recovery, show hope for victims of abuse! - Prove to them that there is hope and possibilities out there is you are will to go for them!
Kokolita's was born and the grand opening was on 11/11/11, which was also Veterans day...another cause to support. From my little shop over the last 5 years we have helped over 8,000 deserving people make their lives better.
With your contributions we will reach the next level as a business and it will blow up that number from 8,000 to 800,000 to 8,000,000 one day. It will amplify our Mission's Success: ""change the world, feed the needy, one treat at a time"". With your contribution YOU get to be the change the world. YOU become a part of that 8 million. We can't do it without YOU!!
Here's the opportunity we have in front of us... 
We worked long and hard and got a connection to the buyers for COSTCO. We were invited to demonstrate our empanadas in their test kitchen at their corporate office. They LOVED them and just like that we got the opportunity to sell them raw in the frozen section to the public at select COSTCO stores.
After lots of research and the proven track record of frozen items sold, we realized that this opportunity will make all the time and energy my family and I have sacrificed, the many nights they had to go to work with me worth it for their futures and for all the people we help through our little company. But to make it happen we needed a plan...

<h3>WHAT MAKES US SO DARN SPECIAL</h3>
<p><strong>quality assurance</strong></p>
<p>We will employ our own laboratory from day one in order to craft the best beer possible. The laboratory is a  key component of our Quality Assurance Program ensuring excellence in our beer. James' extensive scientific  background and training will allow for knowledgeable implementation of these programs, which will save both time and money on outside testing. We are fortunate to have the expertise on site to implement these programs which are unfortunately uncommon in most craft breweries.</p>
<p><strong>culture craft</strong></p>
<p>Gunbarrel Brewing Company is among an elite society of International breweries to employ a coolship. We are the first brewery in the United States to open with one, marking our commitment to continuing the tradition of spontaneous fermentation started long ago in  Belgium.</p>
<p>A coolship is a large, shallow, open vessel in which fresh wort is exposed to wild yeast and bacteria from the environment. After exposure these beers are then allowed to ferment and age in oak barrels. This process allows for unique flavors to arise from the local wild organisms along with flavors derived from each individual barrel, giving our beer a special sense of place. With time, patience, and love, these beers develop into exceptionally unique beers that vary from batch to batch and year to year, bestowing new and intriguing tastes upon our consumers.</p>
<p><strong>eco consciousness</strong></p>
<p>We make sustainable resource and disposal choices, to lessen our impact on the environment, enhance overall efficiency, and convert waste into a valuable product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement universal zero waste requirements and comply with the Universal Zero Waste Ordinance.</li>
<li>Donate spent grain, the leftover malt, to farmers to be re-purposed into animal feed.</li>
<li>Packaging product only in serving tanks, kegs and cans instead of bottles whenever possible.</li>
<li>100% clean energy powered business by offsetting our energy usage with Green-e certified Renewable Energy Certificates from American wind farms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>community</strong></p>
<p>Craft beer brings people together from all walks of life in the name of the best hobby there is - appreciating all things craft beer. We will host our own regularly planned beer education club. Stay tuned for details! Additionally, visitors will enjoy trivia, games, themed parties, beer and food pairings.</p>
<p>Our annual Found Fruit Project highlights the enthusiastic donations of fruit from community members throughout Boulder County. The project helps to keep perfectly good fruit from going to waste, while pushing our imaginations to produce some really innovative brews with a real sense of place! In 2017, we will be hosting a huge party at the brewery to celebrate the beers we make with community sourced ""found fruit""!</p>
<p><strong>investing in our people</strong></p>
<p>While aspiring to brew some of the best beers in the world, we also want to be the best company to work for that we can be. We are building a team of hardworking, passionate, driven and  talented people who share our love for outstanding craft beer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our passion for great beer is what defines us. Having everyone in our company not just share this passion, but also share the knowledge that underpins this passion is imperative to our mission. The Cicerone program is similar to Sommelier qualifications but it is completely focused on beer. We provide training for all of our co-workers, we fund the exams and study materials, provide training sessions and even give people an automatic pay raise for each level of the accreditation they pass.</li>
<li>Great service is a cornerstone of our success and what defines our customer relationships and interactions with each other as a team. We intentionally create an organizational culture that nurtures great service. We teach each and every one of our employees the recipe that we have developed for great service.</li>
</ul>
<p>We treat everyone we come into contact with as an individual and with care. We provide them with high quality service to match and EVEN enhance the high quality CRAFT beer that WE SERVE.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>IMPACT</h3>
<p>The past three years have been leading up to this moment.  We searched far and wide and finally have a place that will be perfect for the brewery of our dreams (and yours too we hope!). Your contribution to this project represents a very unique opportunity to be a part of something special and impactful. </p>

the market but there are few that have mostly natural ingredients and even
fewer still that have been developed by Pharmacists.  Let's face it, pharmacists know about
formulation and pharmacists also know about chemistry, biology and can do the
calculations necessary for success.  All
of this makes for excellent products!
The Apothecary's Gift is a fragrance, skin care and hair
product line that is owned and developed by me.  My name is Vanessa LeSure-Walker.  I am a
pharmacist, with about 20 years behind the counter and 12 years of experience

<p>You'll be able to come in for just a cup of coffee, breakfast, lunch or snack, or you can hang out, stay awhile and play a library of amazing board games, pick up the latest Deadpool comic, or shop our awesome t-shirts or POP figures.  </p>
<p>We'll also have themed game nights, options for birthday parties and special events and other awesome things to do.  </p>
<p>What does the Jammy Dodger Have to Offer?</p>
<p>A library of tons of games, available for unlimited play</p>
<p>A positive space to interact one-on-one with friends and family</p>
<p>Light fare, from sandwiches to pastries, cupcakes to homemade soups.</p>
<p>Delicious beverages- we'll have a full coffee bar, proper English teas, lemonade, hot chocolate, and more.</p>
<p>An educated staff to suggest and teach new games, dish on the latest comics  or just bring you a latte`!</p>
<p>Why Do We Want to Open The Jammy Dodger?</p>
<p>We love New Braunfels, but feel like it's lacking a good outlet for people that like comics and games.  There is a huge culture of people that are ""nerdy"", and not enough outlets for them.  We also have a family and feel like there's not enough places in NB that cater to families with kids over the age of 5.  We want you to come hang out with your family without electronics (okay, maybe the occasional selfie is okay :) ).  We love playing with our kids and think you will too!  We think The Jammy Dodger is a place where you can really have fun and interact one on one.</p>
<p>We love the idea of creating a space where people can interact in person, having fun together without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Why We're Crowdfunding</p>
<p>While we have the down payment, a business plan that has been praised by every bank we've taken it to, and four banks that are working on our application as we speak, opening a cafe costs a LOT of money.  We're putting a lot of our own funds in,  but we also wanted to give the community the opportunity to supplement our funds.  The $10,000 we're raising will help cover getting the spot we have our heart set on (at the Marketplace), renovations, a better espresso machine, two ovens instead of one, or a beer and wine license faster than we'd planned.  It will also help us to ensure we are making The Jammy Dodger the best place it can be.  </p>
<p>Be sure to check out our awesome perks- little ways for us to say ""thank you!"" for anything you might be able to contribute.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>Opening any small business is always risky.  We've been working on the early stages of opening The Jammy Dodger for almost a year and have become accustomed to the fact that things will very seldom go as planned, there were always be one more thing to do and it's important to be flexible.  However, we've also put in a ton of time and research and done everything we can to meet with people who know better than us to make sure we've accounted for all the pieces we need to complete in order to successfully open in the Spring of 2017.</p>

Ed Wong is one of my oldest, dearest friends.  Together we opened Henry Brown’s Small Batch Ice Cream in July, 2015!   We've been delighted to be part of a group of vendors at the Hamilton Farmers' Market's REAL FOOD COURT.  We're known for creating an energetic new prepared food environment.  Vendors throughout The Market are a big part of the excitement, too!!</p><p>We've been astonished by and grateful for how many loyal customers we've gained in our time there.  It has been (at times) exhausting, yet it has always been both exciting and incredibly gratifying.  Visit our website to learn more about the company:  <a href=""https://www.henrybrowns.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.henrybrowns.com</a></p><p>Staying with Henry Brown’s feels right.  Some of you may know of me because of my work as a project manager and community-builder, promoting local, sustainable food while creating tangible new links between all kinds of food communities across our city – connections made through my six years of non-profit work at Environment Hamilton’s Hamilton Eat Local.  I love local food.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482121491/jzzwotyqolenf8hden7r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>WHAT I NEED:  My business partner is moving his share of the business to Toronto, which means I’m starting my ice cream business from scratch.  As of today, I’m seeking the funds to do so here on Indiegogo because I need to raise $12k by December 31, 2016.  That’s all it’s going to take to fund my start up!  Or should I say “re-startup”?</p><p>I need to rebuild my shop from the ground up: I'll need whisks and bowls and a new cash register.  To start my first batches I'll need the milk and cream and the organic Fair Trade raw sugar and chocolate that make our product so special.  I will need a stock of ice cream cups, cones, napkins and more in time for our opening day.  I'll need to rent and buy freezer equipment as well as purchase four new Breville ice cream making machines, a refrigerator, an induction burner and other kitchen appliances.  Shelving will be required and supplies will be needed to make repairs made to the existing kitchen cupboards, too.  I'll need to keep the bills paid and the rent covered right from the start.  I'll need a portion of the funds for my salary.  It’s a long list of bare minimum items!

Ed Wong is one of my oldest, dearest friends.  Together we opened Henry Brown’s Small Batch Ice Cream in July, 2015!   We've been delighted to be part of a group of vendors at the Hamilton Farmers' Market's REAL FOOD COURT.  We're known for creating an energetic new prepared food environment.  Vendors throughout The Market are a big part of the excitement, too!!We've been astonished by and grateful for how many loyal customers we've gained in our time there.  It has been (at times) exhausting, yet it has always been both exciting and incredibly gratifying.  Visit our website to learn more about the company:  www.henrybrowns.comStaying with Henry Brown’s feels right.  Some of you may know of me because of my work as a project manager and community-builder, promoting local, sustainable food while creating tangible new links between all kinds of food communities across our city – connections made through my six years of non-profit work at Environment Hamilton’s Hamilton Eat Local.  I love local food. What I Need & What You Get WHAT I NEED:  My business partner is moving his share of the business to Toronto, which means I’m starting my ice cream business from scratch.  As of today, I’m seeking the funds to do so here on Indiegogo because I need to raise $12k by December 31, 2016.  That’s all it’s going to take to fund my start up!  Or should I say “re-startup”?I need to rebuild my shop from the ground up: I'll need whisks and bowls and a new cash register.  To start my first batches I'll need the milk and cream and the organic Fair Trade raw sugar and chocolate that make our product so special.  I will need a stock of ice cream cups, cones, napkins and more in time for our opening day.  I'll need to rent and buy freezer equipment as well as purchase four new Breville ice cream making machines, a refrigerator, an induction burner and other kitchen appliances.  Shelving will be required and supplies will be needed to make repairs made to the existing kitchen cupboards, too.  I'll need to keep the bills paid and the rent covered right from the start.  I'll need a portion of the funds for my salary.  It’s a long list of bare minimum items!  As before, I will source them as much as possible from places like The Re-Store and independent local businesses wherever possible, to make good use of cash resources.  These are just some of the items that are necessary to re-start Henry Brown's.WHAT YOU GET:  Folks who contribute to my campaign will be supporting a sustainable, locally based food business and in return they will reap some fine rewards.Perks range from a little lapel pin and a subscription to our new monthly newsletter to an in-home ""Ice Cream Party at Your Place"".  You can choose a perk that includes an invitation to ""Henry's Big Ice Cream Party"" in February 2017 (a downtown location, TBA).  One donation level makes you a member of my new ""Quarterly Quart Club"" and another level can makes you a member of my monthly ""CSI: Community Supported Ice Cream"" Program -- details below. There's a perk for every budget and every level of engagement.  You can enjoy the rewards yourself or they can be great holiday gifts for the Henry Brown's fans in your life!(WHAT ABOUT THAT ""CSI"" THING… ?)My CSI program is inspired by the ""CSA"" programs that have become increasingly popular in recent years.  It’s my attempt at a nod at one of the coolest things in sustainable local food access and development: the CSA (which stands for Community Supported Agriculture) is a way to support food growers/farmers by purchasing a share of the farm's annual output at the start of the growing season -- and reaping the rewards of your support by getting shares of the food grown at harvest time.  Cool, eh?The ""Henry Brown's Community Supported Ice Cream (CSI)"" program is designed to help get Henry Brown's on solid ground financially, and it only makes sense to thank you for that support with ""shares"" in the form of scoops, pints and quarts of my fresh, small batch ice creams and sorbets.If you do select one of the CSI Perks then just contact us at info@henrybrowns.com to place your order at least 5-7 days ahead of your ideal pickup date.  Make sure that your order is confirmed as being ready before you come to pick it up – you will be notified however you prefer: phone or email. The Impact Over the six years that I worked for Hamilton Eat Local people everywhere were telling me how much they value local food, especially food that is made with care, by hand, with high quality ingredients.  In my time at Henry Brown's, I keep hearing the same things from my customers: how much they truly appreciate the great ingredients and understand that what goes in and what stays out is important to them and to their families.Our customers have talked about going out of their way to find foods made with ingredients that are authentic, made with handmade care, and above all, foods that don't just taste real -- Hamiltonians want foods that are real.  They've expressed the importance of supporting local food producers with their wallets.The word about Henry Brown's has certainly spread by word of mouth, social media, bloggers and the business press.  We've had visitors who have travelled from Toronto and from Markham just to taste our products!  And at least one food critic wrote in a blog post that there is nothing like Henry Brown's to be found in Toronto.  Yes, we're still blushing over that one: http://www.dinemagazine.ca/2016/11/hamilton-renaissance/ Risks & Challenges As with any new business, there are some potential hurdles.  The first is continuing to increase sales year to year to ensure the long-term sustainability of the business.  The other challenging aspect of the location is the cyclical nature of the business... some months revenue is scarce, while in other months the cash is as free-flowing as the ice cream.  Understanding these cycles and adjusting operations to work through them takes patience and adaptability.  A small business like this one can definitely be described as agile!

<p>We are a family (American husband, Japanese wife, and two kids) that live in the countryside of Japan, just outside of Tokyo. We have been working on a project to renovate a 150 year old farmhouse into a farm-to-table with Japanese chefs that cater locally grown organic food, and a bed and breakfast for people from around the world.</p>
<p>Since after the 3-11 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, we have become more aware of what we eat and how we spend our time. We moved out to the countryside that's close enough from Tokyo to experiment what life would be like in the countryside.</p>
<p>We realized that there is an abundance of nature, experience, and organically and locally grown food that would be amazing for the rest of the world as well to enjoy. That's when we had the idea to renovate an old farmhouse nearby, so we can create a place for people to stay, enjoy, eat, and experience what we love about this place.</p>
<p>This three-storied farmhouse is a gem of a place with a huge cellar is like none you have ever seen. However, once we started the renovation we realized that the house was in a bad condition, rotting from the foundation. Initially we thought it only needed some face-lifting, but as it turned out, a major construction and rebuilding from the ground up was necessary to make it presentable and usable.  It has extended our timeline and also made us go way over budget. This is why we have set up a campaign to share the project with the rest of the world and to ask for some support to complete the project. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The most expensive part of the housebuild, at least in Japan, has been the money needed to pay the carpenters. We spent well over 20,000USD for the 5 carpenters that came to help us since February 2015. We were originally going to ask for help in funding a part of this, but since the video was shot, due to our delayed timeline we had to move quickly to make the place ""usable"".  However, it is still not complete and we still need help - with the bathhouse, the deck, the 2.5th floor, the pizza oven. This is where we would like to ask for your help.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the estimated costs of the remaining work:</p>
<p>Traditional Japanese Bathhouse: H<span style=""background-color: initial;"">ot water for the sink and a shelf, and the outdoor bath structure needs to be completed, alongside a cover/wall/shrubs all around it for privacy. (estimated cost: 350,000 yen) </span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Deck:  We took down the old deck that was rotting away and we would like to build a new relaxing space. (estimated cost: 300,000 yen)</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">2.5th floor: As the farmhouse was used for silk production, there is a 2.5th floor with a lower ceiling that is kind of a ""hideout"". New flooring and woodwork needs to be done to make it usable. (estimated cost: 250,000 yen)</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Pizza oven: We would like to put this in the yard, built from clay, bricks, etc. (estimated cost: 60,000 yen)</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Garden: We plan to apply concepts of permaculture design into a beautiful garden. (estimated cost: 40,000 yen)</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we luckily exceed our goal, we will invest that extra money for other projects we also have in mind, such as to make a rocket stove near the entrance, and for cleaning up the cellar to make it more usable.</span><br/></p>
<p>We intend to provide unique perks - we would of course like to giveaway some complimentary stay at the beautiful lodge (note: valid for one year, subject to availability/occupancy), but on top of that, we want to give away one-of-a-kind experience, as that is our thing!  We will provide perks such as:  chicken tour (we have been raising free-range chickens since 2012) + lunch using the fresh eggs you pick up, organic farm tour + lunch using the seasonal vegetables that you pick,  woodcarving workshops with craftsmen who made some of the furniture for the house+ lunch, pizza oven workshop + pizza for lunch, rocket stove workshop + lunch cooked on that oven, etc.</p>

The Impact

The farm-to-table concept is still very new to Japan, although we know that it is getting quite popular and well-known in other parts of the world, especially in places like Hawaii and some parts of the U.S.  Japanese countryside has SO much to offer - locally grown organic food + amazing Chefs and nature to name a few. Let's make it more well known so you and others can experience them and enjoy them!
Also, we are not new to running lodging in Japan,  as we have been running 2 apartments and a house on AirBnB for vacation travels since 2014. You can rest assured we know what we are doing, and that we are  committed to making it as successful as it can be. That is why we are here today.
   Risks & Challenges We had many obstacles along the way.  Like I said earlier, the house was in a much worse state than we initially imagined, costing a lot more to fix than initially intended.  Not only that, because the house has a traditional frame and structure, we had to hire special carpenters who had skills to work with a house like this, and they were not easy to find, and pricier than others.

<h4><b>Hello
there... welcome! We are a group of Boomer Women who have come together to
re-define aging... would you like to help us?</b></h4>
<p>We belong
to a stage in a woman's life that has <b><span>never before existed</span></b> in
the traditional ""maiden/mother/crone"" stages of a woman's life. <i>Not ready to be a Crone yet? well, with all
due respect,</i> <i>neither are we</i>!<br/>
<br/>
In our little lifetime 3 major events have changed 10,000 years of women's
history with regard to the stages of a woman's life:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>the invention of ""The
     Pill ""...  This allowed us the unprecedented gift of 'Choice'.
     For the first time in women's history, we - </b><i>as a generation <b>-</b></i><b> were
     able to decide if/how/and when we chose to start </b>(<i>&amp; equally
     important, when to stop)</i><b> our families... leading to longer,
     healthier lives.</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>couple this with...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>the ongoing
     spirit of the Women's Movement... which precipitated many much needed family law revisions
     to the legal system, allowing women to choose to live on their own
     with <i>guaranteed</i> financial security from the recognition
     of their marital contribution.</b> </li>
</ul>
<p>and
lastly...</p>
<ul>
<li><b>the sheer numbers of baby
     boomer women (40 million - conservative estimate)... have been affecting
     our society since the day we were born - from the need for more hospitals,
     schools, &amp; housing - to now changing the nature of retirement facilities...
     even the very nature of retirement itself!</b></li>
</ul>
<p>All combined
have set the stage so that somewhere between the ""mother"" and
the ""crone"" our generation has become a whole new ballgame... a whole
new stage of healthier, more financially stable, mature women ... just not ready to
take on the mantle of the ""Crone"" yet. </p>
<p>But what
should this new stage of a woman's life be called? I was out walking with a 72
year old friend of mine when she said ""well we <i>are</i> women
of wisdom, we <i>should</i> know what to call ourselves"" ... and
the penny dropped! ...of course,  we'll call ourselves <b><span>WOWs</span></b>  (<b>W</b>omen <b>O</b>f <b>W</b>isdom)
and in this new stage of a woman's life we'll be known as the <b>WOW
FACTOR</b>! </p>
<p>We are building a tasteful, informative, interactive, easy-to-navigate website. <a href=""http://www.boomerwomenareunique.com/PREVIEW-index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>It will be called BoomerWomenAreUnique.com and you can preview it here. </i></a>We
want it to deal with issues pertaining to us and cover the

there... welcome! We are a group of Boomer Women who have come together to
re-define aging... would you like to help us?
We belong
to a stage in a woman's life that has never before existed in
the traditional ""maiden/mother/crone"" stages of a woman's life. Not ready to be a Crone yet? well, with all
due respect, neither are we!

In our little lifetime 3 major events have changed 10,000 years of women's
history with regard to the stages of a woman's life:


the invention of ""The
     Pill ""...  This allowed us the unprecedented gift of 'Choice'.
     For the first time in women's history, we - as a generation - were
     able to decide if/how/and when we chose to start (& equally
     important, when to stop) our families... leading to longer,
     healthier lives.


couple this with...


the ongoing
     spirit of the Women's Movement... which precipitated many much needed family law revisions
     to the legal system, allowing women to choose to live on their own
     with guaranteed financial security from the recognition
     of their marital contribution. 

and
lastly...

the sheer numbers of baby
     boomer women (40 million - conservative estimate)... have been affecting
     our society since the day we were born - from the need for more hospitals,
     schools, & housing - to now changing the nature of retirement facilities...
     even the very nature of retirement itself!

All combined
have set the stage so that somewhere between the ""mother"" and
the ""crone"" our generation has become a whole new ballgame... a whole
new stage of healthier, more financially stable, mature women ... just not ready to
take on the mantle of the ""Crone"" yet. 
But what
should this new stage of a woman's life be called? I was out walking with a 72
year old friend of mine when she said ""well we are women
of wisdom, we should know what to call ourselves"" ... and
the penny dropped! ...of course,  we'll call ourselves WOWs  (Women Of Wisdom)
and in this new stage of a woman's life we'll be known as the WOW
FACTOR! 
We are building a tasteful, informative, interactive, easy-to-navigate website. It will be called BoomerWomenAreUnique.com and you can preview it here. We
want it to deal with issues pertaining to us and cover the
body/mind/heart/& soul. I learned how to use HTML to set things up and the
other women chose areas of expertise we call 'corners' (for example, in the
'Alkaline Corner' in the Body section...  AlkaGal presents her favorite tried
& true alkaline food recipes to help keep your system on the alkaline side,
along with information on what exactly we mean by ""alkaline"" and why

<b>Help support Crossnore’s efforts to rebuild their historic landmark!</b><br/><p>Rachel Deal is spearheading the town
of Crossnore's efforts, with the help of Crossnore Community Enhancement (a
non-profit), to raise private funds to rebuild the town's landmark - the footbridge
over Hwy 221. </p>
<p>Rachel Dellinger Deal is the niece of
Mary Martin Sloop, founder of the Crossnore School. It was Mary Martin Sloop who
was responsible for having the first wooden footbridge put up over Hwy 221 in
the 1930's. That bridge was replaced in the 1950s and stood until an overloaded
logging truck ran into the bridge in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Mary Martin Sloop built the original
bridge so that the townsfolk and the children of the Crossnore School would
have a safe way to cross over the highway. Many people have fond memories of
seeing the children walk hand-in-hand, two-by-two down the road and over the
bridge. There are memories of lazy Sundays sitting on the bridge watching the
world go by, making wishes under the Archway, proposals were made and newlyweds
posed for wedding pictures. The bridge was an integral part of this small
community’s day-to-day life.</p>

Bridge of Memories in its new home over Crossnore Creek<br/><br/>
<p>It is one of Rachel Deal's dreams to see the
footbridge replaced over Hwy 221, a bridge that would provide safe passage over
the highway, allowing the children of the Crossnore School, the community, as
well as visitors the pleasure of walking to and from town on the trail system. Rebuilding
the bridge will also preserve a local landmark and the scenic beauty of the
area surrounding the small town of Crossnore.</p>
<p>For this campaign we are
looking to raise $75,000.00 to get us started. The initial round of funding
will cover the planning stages of the bridge – the survey and site plans,  engineering geotech studies,  civil engineering  for the encroachment over Hwy 221 and the
final working architectural drawings of the headwalls and staircases.</p>
<p>Over the coming year we will
need to raise $300,000.00 to complete the project. Your donation will help to
make the footbridge a reality – letting Rachel Deal and the townspeople of
Crossnore and the surrounding counties know that dreams really can come true!</p>
<p>Rachel Deal has a long history of making
dreams come true. <span>She devotes her time to
volunteerism, working with the animal shelter she helped found, working with
seniors, women, churches, in education, and medical care. </span></p>

Our Undergraduate Student Government at Arizona State University decided not to fund the run this year. We count on them every year and this year, we were not funded by them. Put simply, we need your help. Badly. </p>
<p>Who are we? We are a group of passionate individuals with a specific goal of success in mind. Together we make up a small, yet powerful and motivated team; Wendi Arnold - President, Mat Sherman - Media Director, Nick Bobrowitz - Productions Director and Rayne Foster - Public Relations Director. <br/></p>
<p>What does saving this event entail? It means getting enough funding to put on the event next spring, and potentially an event during the fall semester, without USG's financial support. </p>
<p>To fill that void, we are asking for your support. Will you support us?</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We need $15,000...That's on the low end too. It sounds like a lot of money so we will be as transparent as we can with you:</span></p>
</div><div><div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Security, barricades, and fencing ($5,000 ) - To ensure that this is a safe event, we need to have an influx of security there (Pro Em). Thousands of students come and we want to make it as safe as possible. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>Food - ($5,000) People need to eat. Although the core of this event is charity, people are going to want to chow down on some Raising Canes after the run or before the run to prepare. </li>
<li>Production (%5,000) - A core part of this event is the entertainment. We are are a charity event but the students who come also expect a production to be put on, or else many wouldn't come and donate in the first place. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<b>So you know, this is flexible funding so if we don't hit $15,000 we get a huge percentage taken off from how much you donated.</b> The reason we did this is because we are a registered 501(c) organization and flexible funding was the only option that indiegogo gave. </div>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This event has produced 44,000 pounds of clothes thus far. That is an average of over six thousand a year.

</div> </div> <p>Invest in us. Invest in the future of the run.</p></div>","Short Summary If you watched our video, you see who we are. You might be wondering why are we reaching out? Our Undergraduate Student Government at Arizona State University decided not to fund the run this year. We count on them every year and this year, we were not funded by them. Put simply, we need your help. Badly. 
Who are we? We are a group of passionate individuals with a specific goal of success in mind. Together we make up a small, yet powerful and motivated team; Wendi Arnold - President, Mat Sherman - Media Director, Nick Bobrowitz - Productions Director and Rayne Foster - Public Relations Director. 
What does saving this event entail? It means getting enough funding to put on the event next spring, and potentially an event during the fall semester, without USG's financial support. 
To fill that void, we are asking for your support. Will you support us?
What We Need & What You Get
We need $15,000...That's on the low end too. It sounds like a lot of money so we will be as transparent as we can with you:



Security, barricades, and fencing ($5,000 ) - To ensure that this is a safe event, we need to have an influx of security there (Pro Em). Thousands of students come and we want to make it as safe as possible. 

Food - ($5,000) People need to eat. Although the core of this event is charity, people are going to want to chow down on some Raising Canes after the run or before the run to prepare. 
Production (%5,000) - A core part of this event is the entertainment. We are are a charity event but the students who come also expect a production to be put on, or else many wouldn't come and donate in the first place.  



So you know, this is flexible funding so if we don't hit $15,000 we get a huge percentage taken off from how much you donated. The reason we did this is because we are a registered 501(c) organization and flexible funding was the only option that indiegogo gave. 

The Impact

This event has produced 44,000 pounds of clothes thus far. That is an average of over six thousand a year. By donating to save the run, you are contributing to an event that will likely result in over 6,000 pounds of clothes for our charities. Who are our charities?

Andre House - http://andrehouse.org/


Goodwill - https://www.goodwillaz.org/


Research them, learn to love them like we love them. You aren't just investing in the run. You are investing in these charities.    Risks & Challenges
There are people that want us to fail. There are people that want to defund us. There are people that want our run to fall to the ground and never to rise again. 
However, the event could be too big for the staff at the moment to plan which means we will just have to recruit more staff. If you are interested in helping out with this event and being apart of our incredible team, please fill out our staff application.

<p><i>If you have not read of it, you may do so with the latest updates:</i></p>
<p><i><a href=""http://www.straitstimes.com/news/asia/south-east-asia/story/sabah-quake-more-remains-be-airlifted-mount-kinabalu-20150607"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.straitstimes.com/news/asia/south-east-asia/story/sabah-quake-more-remains-be-airlifted-mount-kinabalu-20150607</a> <br/></i></p>

<p>I'm a strong believer in the what crowdfunding can accomplish, especially when it comes to campaigns that have a widespread impact on us Singaporeans.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi everyone, I'm Luke, a senior at Singapore Management University (SMU) and a Singaporean who is as saddened as most of us about the unfortunate passing of the Singaporean victims at Mount Kinabalu. 
If you have not read of it, you may do so with the latest updates:

I'm a strong believer in the what crowdfunding can accomplish, especially when it comes to campaigns that have a widespread impact on us Singaporeans. Crowdfunding has been tested and validated in Community Projects, and I trust that this campaign will be no different. Thus, my main purpose for creating this campaign is to raise funds, which will be distributed to the various families that have lost their loved ones. 
I have little idea what impact these funds will have for the families, but I do know that it will be a form of condolence from us Singaporeans to fellow Singaporeans. Through your contributions, you can be part of a movement that leverages technology to hopefully provide financial relief to those who are undergoing pain. We have seen the news, we have been burdened by the pictures and now is the time to act on it.
What We Need & What You Get
 Given that the number of victims are still unconfirmed, I hope to raise any amount, which will all be distributed to the various families via the school or MOE based on the needs analysis conducted by the two organizations. Even though this campaign may not reach the goal (hopefully it does), the amount will still be distributed to the families in the most appropriate manner.
This is purely non-profit, I have no desire of keeping anything for myself. 
Since this campaign is for Singaporeans, by Singaporeans, I have nothing spectacular to give. However, in exchange for the donations that are pulled together, I will be compiling a list of names of donors, which will be posted on the Facebook page that I have created and hopefully other websites (if we can get the traction). 
The Impact
 To be honest, I do not wish to make any claims about the size of the impact that your donations will have. However, I firmly believe that any form of financial aid in the form of a token of condolence will be of help to the various families that are affected. 
Though the donation you make may seem small, I know that it will have a lasting impact on not only those who receive, but also on Singaporeans as a whole. Singaporeans have done contributed to successful campaigns in the past, now it's a great time to do it again.
    Risks & Challenges All foreseen risks have been mitigated. Both transferring of funds and distribution channels have been established, following the contact made with Madam Cham, the point of contact for any contribution raising.

1. Transferring of Funds (Indiegogo or Direct Transfer)As the school staff are heavily stretched from their current operations, the two week period for collection is appropriate, since it will end after all operational dust has settled.
We have been told that there will be a Central Fund set up by the school to collate all contributions together. Thus, we will direct the contributions straight into this designated account instead of the Proposed OCBC account as initially planned. For those who wish to direct transfers, it was suggested to hold off till next Sunday, when the campaign ends, to transfer it straight to the designated account.
2. Distribution of FundsThere has been a concern from people about the method of distribution of the funds. As discussed with Madam Cham, the school is working closely with MOE and the families to have a clear idea of the needs for each family. Thus, once the funds are collected in the Central Fund, it will be distributed by the school/MOE to the families in the most appropriate manner.
To increase the transparency of this campaign, I plan on providing updates via this campaign site and Facebook Page as regularly as possible. Moreover, my contact details will be below if you wish on contacting me with enquiries directly.
Other Ways You Can Help
 If you are unable to provide any form of contribution, there's nothing to worry about! You can help by furthering the crowd effect by sharing this campaign to those you know via Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, etc. 
A couple of clicks can go a long way.

<p>My name is <span>Deb, Founder of <b>IT FLU</b>, a software development and
marketing company with a solid reputation of excellence, an exciting portfolio
of cutting-edge digital services, and plans for a powerful global reach. We
started with one satisfied customer, and five years later that number has risen
in thousand. Customers come to us because we offer world-class marketing
solutions; because we are unequivocally the best in our field; because we can
be trusted; and because we simply get things done! </span></p>
<p>We have both the credentials and the experience. I hold an
MBA in International Business – a degree that has given me a valuable
perspective on international business strategies. My team is small, but it is a
powerhouse of top-notch IT experts, and we hope to add additional staff of
equal caliber. Our energy, exuberance and combined talents fuel our signature
creativity, and our customer service cannot be compared. We are based in India,
but our clients have the following distribution: 85% of our clients come from
the United States, 10% come from other countries, and 5% come from India. </p>
<p><i>We are extremely proud that we are now

<p><b><i>IT FLU </i></b><i>approaches marketing with integrity,
with honesty, and with common sense. </i>We don’t just market blindly for the
sake of marketing. We respect consumers, and we are sensitive to their needs
and preferences. We know that excellence, honesty, great navigational tools, impeccable
content and exceptional web design sets us apart from our competitors. A strong
segment of our Internet marketing staff are past Google employees. We <b>KNOW </b>the business!</p>
<p>We also know that there are risks and challenges with any
venture. We understand this, and we are not afraid to address potential
setbacks. At times, we are concerned about whether <b>IT FLU </b>will be able to “spread its wings” as widely as we expect
and whether our software designs will help our clients achieve their goals as
quickly as we anticipate. But at those times, our team stands tall and steps
forward because we know that our vision is clear; our business plan is solid;
we’ve tested the market; we’ve developed international business relationships;
and we have the will <i>AND</i> the
expertise to succeed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The impact that we will make on the global market will be powerful.
We intend to set an international benchmark for quality service, product
development excellence, and professional integrity. We will initiate and model
the very best practices in the field. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>IT FLU</i></b><i> is also a company with a heart. As
we expand our business, we pledge to contribute <b>20%</b> of our proceeds to support
programs that address <b>world hunger and the plight of children who have been
orphaned </b>because of global conflict. We chose these two causes because we
believe that, as world citizens, it is our responsibility to do so.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436016847/vfywilx2ioncuucdkqja.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><i>How do I know which service to choose?</i></b></p>
<p>We offer a complementary in-depth analysis of your needs
before making a service recommendation. We have several standard packages that
you can build on or we can create a “custom package” just for you.</p>
<p><b><i>What kind of graphic design work do you do?</i></b></p>
<p>We do <b>print design</b>
(flyers, posters, banners, brochures, catalogues, stationery branding,
corporate identity, and logo design); <b>web
design</b>(websites, mobile sites, banners, and social media banners); and <b>App design</b> (iOS and Android). Design is
one of the most important elements of marketing. If a constituent cannot relate
to a design – no matter how elegant or catchy – it is useless. We make sure
that all visuals are striking, impactful, relevant and inspire action.</p>
<p><b><i>What do you mean by “outsourcing (hire a professional)”
options?</i></b></p>
<p>Outsourcing was never this easy.  Today we have taken our outsourcing division
it to a new level. Whether you need a developer, a designer, or more customized
support, we can find the right professional for you. We have numerous benefits to offer, like the option of hiring employees already
on our pay roll, which can reduce stress for small to mid-size companies. Before
we outsource employees, we conduct a complete “requirement analysis” to make
sure that the match is perfect, and our clients then have the freedom to
interact with candidate directly for best results.</p>

                                    Marketing Needs - Marketing
Solutions 
                                   Exciting Innovations - Endless Possibilities 

My name is Deb, Founder of IT FLU, a software development and
marketing company with a solid reputation of excellence, an exciting portfolio
of cutting-edge digital services, and plans for a powerful global reach. We
started with one satisfied customer, and five years later that number has risen
in thousand. Customers come to us because we offer world-class marketing
solutions; because we are unequivocally the best in our field; because we can
be trusted; and because we simply get things done! 
We have both the credentials and the experience. I hold an
MBA in International Business – a degree that has given me a valuable
perspective on international business strategies. My team is small, but it is a
powerhouse of top-notch IT experts, and we hope to add additional staff of
equal caliber. Our energy, exuberance and combined talents fuel our signature
creativity, and our customer service cannot be compared. We are based in India,
but our clients have the following distribution: 85% of our clients come from
the United States, 10% come from other countries, and 5% come from India. 
We are extremely proud that we are now
in a position to become a key player in the global market, but we need your help to give us the
financial boost to catapult us into the big league. Our campaign goal is$300,000. We will use this sum to
increase our staff; expand our current infrastructure to accommodate global
outreach; and launch new office in USA, innovative software. 

All donations, of any size, are appreciated.
As Kahlil Gibran says, “In one drop of water are found all the secrets of all
the oceans,” In the same way, your donation defines you as a member of a collaboration
of visionary donors who have faith in the entrepreneurial spirit, hard work,
and determination – who have faith in us!
If
we are successful in our campaign, we will be able to introduce our core
services to major new markets, including Europe, Canada, South America, South
Africa, Australia and Asia.

These services include,
but are not limited to:


Digital
Marketing


Content
Development and Maintenance


Customized
Web Design and Development


Graphics
Design for Impactful Branding


iOS
and Android Development


Games
and Apps Marketing Strategies


Outsourcing
(Hire a Professional) Options



We are confident that we will reach
our goal – but if not, we will still
expand globally. It may be at a slightly slower pace, but nothing will stop us!
Your faith in us will be justified. The future is ours!
IT FLU approaches marketing with integrity,
with honesty, and with common sense. We don’t just market blindly for the
sake of marketing. We respect consumers, and we are sensitive to their needs
and preferences. We know that excellence, honesty, great navigational tools, impeccable
content and exceptional web design sets us apart from our competitors. A strong
segment of our Internet marketing staff are past Google employees. We KNOW the business!
We also know that there are risks and challenges with any
venture. We understand this, and we are not afraid to address potential
setbacks. At times, we are concerned about whether IT FLU will be able to “spread its wings” as widely as we expect
and whether our software designs will help our clients achieve their goals as
quickly as we anticipate. But at those times, our team stands tall and steps
forward because we know that our vision is clear; our business plan is solid;
we’ve tested the market; we’ve developed international business relationships;
and we have the will AND the
expertise to succeed.

The impact that we will make on the global market will be powerful.
We intend to set an international benchmark for quality service, product
development excellence, and professional integrity. We will initiate and model
the very best practices in the field. 

IT FLU is also a company with a heart. As
we expand our business, we pledge to contribute 20% of our proceeds to support
programs that address world hunger and the plight of children who have been
orphaned because of global conflict. We chose these two causes because we
believe that, as world citizens, it is our responsibility to do so.
WHAT ABOUT INCENTIVES?
We offer great incentives to
Indiegogo users who invest in our dream. For a donation of $50 or above, we will:


Offer a partnership opportunity
whereby a donor will be able to become a free affiliate with an office under
the name of IT FLU. The arrangement
is simple. The donor connects with a new client; we deliver the services; the donor
receives a generous portion of the sales.


Provide a sampling of the best
examples of YouTube and Pinterest ads and a training video that demonstrates
how to run an online campaign. This type of YouTube and Pinterest ads training
video is valued between $1,000 and $1,500, but our donors receive it a deeply
discounted price of $50. The ad training video is designed to help small and
mid-size businesses generate more interest in their products and services
and/or sell more products on Amazon.


Provide a training video with
instructions on how to increase the number of Facebook “likes,” Twitter
“followers,” Pinterest “likes,” and “posts.”


In addition, our team is creating a fun collection of
appreciation “surprises” for donors who make a donation of $5!

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR COMPANY AND SERVICES
We grew quickly for 5 reasons:


We have a talented and experienced
staff


We work closely with Google


We implemented every one of the
marketing techniques that we now include in our services


We have never compromised on
excellence


Our customers are always our
priority. Their satisfaction drives our success.



How do I know which service to choose?
We offer a complementary in-depth analysis of your needs
before making a service recommendation. We have several standard packages that
you can build on or we can create a “custom package” just for you.
What kind of graphic design work do you do?
We do print design
(flyers, posters, banners, brochures, catalogues, stationery branding,
corporate identity, and logo design); web
design(websites, mobile sites, banners, and social media banners); and App design (iOS and Android). Design is
one of the most important elements of marketing. If a constituent cannot relate
to a design – no matter how elegant or catchy – it is useless. We make sure
that all visuals are striking, impactful, relevant and inspire action.
What do you mean by “outsourcing (hire a professional)”
options?
Outsourcing was never this easy.  Today we have taken our outsourcing division
it to a new level. Whether you need a developer, a designer, or more customized
support, we can find the right professional for you. We have numerous benefits to offer, like the option of hiring employees already
on our pay roll, which can reduce stress for small to mid-size companies. Before
we outsource employees, we conduct a complete “requirement analysis” to make
sure that the match is perfect, and our clients then have the freedom to
interact with candidate directly for best results.
FAQs ABOUT CONTRIBUTING FUNDS
Can I make a donation even if I
don’t have a credit card?
Yes – please email us at contact@itflu.com
for information about how you can donate through PayPal or a wire
transfer.
How should I donate if I want to
make a large donation?
The best way to make a large donation ($10k or more) is via
wire transfer. This significantly reduces fees and ensures that more of your
funds reach IT FLU. Please email us
at contact@itflu.com for instructions. 
Why we help you and spend money in
your dream?
We are honest people and working every second to fulfil our
dreams. This funding will help many people; even our perks will boost your
small, large business or selling goods an online. So this is the win-win
opportunity to fulfil each other dream.
Why don’t you use your own money?
We are simple people and our bank account has few thousands
and it wouldn't be possible for us to open our new office in USA and hire new
staff. In this campaigning we are providing great perks which has taken many years
for us to develop those marketing skills which are available in few bucks only.
What if I have a donor advised fund?
Donor advised funds can wire funds to our Indiegogo
campaign.  Please email us at contact@itflu.com for
instructions. 
We understand that some of you would like to contribute, but
do not have the financial resources to do so. However, you can still help us by
spreading the word through your social media contacts and by taking advantage
of the Indiegogo sharing tools. Please also share our campaigning with #ITFLUSTARTUP.
These are exciting times! With sites
like Indiegogo, entrepreneurs are given opportunities that they have never been
given before. Some of the entrepreneurs are new, and their businesses have not
been tested. IT FLU has been in
business for 5 years – maybe not as mature as some companies – but we have landed
strong, and our positive growth pattern has validated the wisdom of our company

Bring London to Los Angeles 
Anglophiles unite! Would you like to walk past the red double decker bus, through the TARDIS and into The Paradise? Enter a shoppe of wonders and glorious trinkets that emulate your heart's desire while the tunes of Morrissey waft through the lavender scented air? Don Holmes' greatcoat, find your way over the fine British foods section, and maybe have a cuppa tea while you watch The Young Ones in our tea room? Make new friends while attending our Whovian viewing events, Downtown Abbey tea parties, geeky game nights and Sherlockian murder mystery tours?
The brains behind this wonderful endeavor run Clockwork Couture, The World's Fynest Steampunk Clothier and Clockwork Cature, animal rescue.  It was their love for England that got them into the fantasy world of Neo-Victoriana and what constantly called back to them.  We want to continue to rescue another 300+ animals and support local artists in this new medium.
  


So WHAT are you crazy blokes doing?First of all, no fake accents. No, just no. Instead we are giving those unable to make the trip across the lily pond a taste of life in a British store. Expect the nice girl with the mohawk and Doc Martens to show you the Ab Fab dvd's, advise you on which confectionaries go best with the loose leaf tea you've chosen, and why The Cure is the best band, ever*. Special order items no one else has, and obscurities you thought no one else knew about. Home to expatriates and locals alike, we won't just be an import store but rather a community center in which to share your love of Britania while getting your geek on.
  The risk? What risk? Okay, sure, retail always has some inherent risk, but we have run a successful retail store for 6 years, and other endeavors before that. We are more than confident that we have secured suppliers and craftsmen to fulfill every Whovian's wish, Sherlock fans secret desire and IT Crowd afficionados itinerary.
Some of the stretch goals include:

30K overfunded, we buy a red double decker bus, straight from the UK and when not parked for all to take pictures with, will be used to host murder mystery road trips, silly tours around LA, and able to be rented for your own adventures.
2k overfunded, a big, red, phone booth (yeah, I know, we have a blue one, but how fun would a RED ONE be?????)

How will you use the $12,000?

Namaste,

My name is Sujan Maharjan, I am 25 years old, and I am a chef, and studying business management.

With the help of my partner, Natalie I am starting this fundraiser in hopes to raise money to rebuild a safe temporary home for my family and help rebuild safe homes in local villages after the devastating earthquake. After the earthquake, my grandparents village was completely destroyed, and my home town of Patan is in tremendous disrepair. My home is filled with cracks, and my parents are sleeping in tents outside. The government has not taken any initiative to check our home, or others in our community for the safety of our buildings. Because the government is not helping us, me and my community are responsible for our recovery.

With your donation, I will be able to support my family in rebuilding a temporary home on our farmland, rebuild my grandparents village, and also help buy supplies to build shelters for families who were left without homes.

Your money will be going directly to my family, whom are very active members of our community. My Father, Babu Kaji Maharjan is the head of the Boy Scouts of Patan, leading groups to help cleanup our community, and travel to more remote villages to rebuild, and create shelters. Me and my friends have also been building temporary shelters made of bamboo and tin roofing, which cost approximately $200 USD to make. Through our teamwork, my friends and I have successfully constructed over 20 shelters in local villages called Kavre, Khokona, and Bungamati.
 
Every day there are so many challenges and health risks including poor water sanitation, terrible air quality, and building safety. The monsoon season is here, which is a blessing for farming rice, our staple crop, but poses problems for many without a shelters. We have to act now!

For those that can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help. Please, spread the word about our fundraiser to all your friends and family. Through teamwork, everything is possible. Me and my family and community have so much hope and energy to rebuild, we just need your support.

Why $5,500,000




To the modern world electricity is more than a commodity. It is a necessity  we no longer can do without. It powers our homes, businesses, communication and entertainment devices. It is the fuel to our economic engine.  
 

Third-world countries depend on modernized nations to assist them with technologies that can provide bare basics such as uncontaminated food  and clean water for survival. Without electricity it would not be possible.
No matter what part of the world, electricity supports our way of life in some way.  

Up to now, we have had limited choices on how our electricity is generated. The choices have been conventional ways such as coal-fired power plants that blow black filthy smoke into the air we breathe day in and day out.Or nuclear power plants that are disasters just waiting to happen at the slightest human error or act of nature, Then  we have solar and wind power which are green ways to produce electricity but come with their own set of limitations.

<br/><p><b>L'idée de base est née lorsque Claire et Aurélie ont
trouvé une solution amusante pour optimiser le rapport coût bateau / utilisation d'Aurélie. C'est au Startup Weekend qu'elles rencontreront Leo (notre designer) et Sara (notre Responsable communication).</b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Nathalie a ensuite entendu parler du projet et nous a rejoint en tant que responsable gestion administrative et financière.</b></p>
<p><b>En détail:</b></p>
<p><b><u>Aurélie</u></b> alias Lilou  est une
passionnée de voyages et de préférence dans les pays où elle peut pratiquer les
sports nautiques. Depuis son premier voyage en Australie, elle ne cesse
d'utiliser les sites collaboratifs tel que Woofing, AirBnb, LoveHomeSwap,
Couchsurfing et bien d'autres. Ne pas partager et échanger est une aberrance
pour elle. Avec son bagout dans les achats internationaux et le suivi
de projets industriels, il est maintenant temps de se lancer dans une
« TransCréation » d’un projet en accord avec ses idées et son mode de
vie.</p>
<p><b><u>Claire</u></b> alias Poule, découvre le goût
de l’entreprenariat comme on devient accro au chocolat en respirant ses
effluves. C’est sa rencontre avec Aurélie qui la plongera dans l’aventure,
dans la volonté créatrice avec l’intime conviction qu’elles faisaient
parties de ce groupe qui croyait au pouvoir de leur idée. Il est temps
désormais de s’engager dans ce projet qui est le fruit d’une réelle motivation
en s’appuyant sur ses 7 années d’expériences professionnelles (achat et qualité
chez Airbus Groupe)</p>
<p><b><u>Sara</u></b>  alias l’aventurière, après 16
mois de circumnavigation, il est temps de rentrer à terre et de mettre ses acquis
de navigatrice et de communicante dans un projet professionnel. Après Paris ,
Bogota, l’océan Pacifique, elle pose ses valises à Marseille et c’est tout
naturellement dans un projet nautique qu’elle s’engage.</p>
<p><b><u>Léo</u></b> alias le brésilien, c'est le
Designer de l'équipe, rencontré au start-up week-end de Marseille, en passage
avant de remonter à Paris, ce passionné de sport nautique et
de design aux nombreux talents ne pouvait passer à coté du projet
We-nav.</p>
<p><b><u>Nathalie </u></b>alias Nat a fait ses
classes dans l’hôtellerie et aujourd’hui elle manie avec dextérité les chiffres
dans un univers international. Elle aussi férue de voyages, elle part vivre 1
an au Canada, où elle attrape le gout de l’aventure. Elle embarque dans
cette nouvelle aventure avec la responsabilité d’être garante des finances.</p>

<h4><b>Somewhere between Airbnb &amp; Courchsurfing, for all water sports activites.</b></h4>
<p>In a world where sharing and trading goods is part of our everyday economy, it seems like the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>People share apartments, car space, designer dresses, and even plumbing equipment.</p>
<p>But what about water sports? That's where We-nav comes in.</p>
<p>We-nav has been created to be the website where you can SWAP, HOST, or RENT water sports equipment.</p>
<p>Imagine the possibility of being able to travel half-way around the world and do your favorite water sport with a local, for less.</p>
<p>Or, you can benefit by sharing your time and experiences with someone else who wants to enjoy the same sport you love.</p>
<br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434718124/dup9rn51v1axvsdg4lgu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><b>The community</b></h3>
<p>We- nav is, above all, a community that brings together people with a desire to share their common interest in water sports activities including: sailing, motor boating , windsurfing , kite surfing , paddle boarding, rowing, canoeing , fishing, wakeboarding , and everything in between. </p>
<p>Through our website, we connect people wishing to do water sports in a new location with those who have equipment so they can :</p>

<br/><h3><b>Our Values</b></h3>
<p>We value the desire to share the love of travel and water sports. So be a part of our fun and adventurous community. </p>
<h3><b>Where is your money going?</b></h3>
<p>Despite our personal funds, bank loans, and other donations, we're still looking for <b>20,000 €</b> in order to kickstart We-nav.</p>
<p>The funds we raise will go towards launching our website, creating adds, sponsoring, networking and for your WeMiles/Goodies.</p>
<p>In fact, all donations we receive are not-for-profit, and will go directly towards making this dream a reality.</p>
<p>However, this campaign needs more than just monetary support.</p>
<p>We also need you to be our best ambassador, so spread the word! </p>
<p><b><i>Talk to your friends, family, and colleagues, and invite them to be a part of the We-nav community</i></b></p>

L’équipe


L'idée de base est née lorsque Claire et Aurélie ont
trouvé une solution amusante pour optimiser le rapport coût bateau / utilisation d'Aurélie. C'est au Startup Weekend qu'elles rencontreront Leo (notre designer) et Sara (notre Responsable communication). Nathalie a ensuite entendu parler du projet et nous a rejoint en tant que responsable gestion administrative et financière.
En détail:
Aurélie alias Lilou  est une
passionnée de voyages et de préférence dans les pays où elle peut pratiquer les
sports nautiques. Depuis son premier voyage en Australie, elle ne cesse
d'utiliser les sites collaboratifs tel que Woofing, AirBnb, LoveHomeSwap,
Couchsurfing et bien d'autres. Ne pas partager et échanger est une aberrance
pour elle. Avec son bagout dans les achats internationaux et le suivi
de projets industriels, il est maintenant temps de se lancer dans une
« TransCréation » d’un projet en accord avec ses idées et son mode de
vie.
Claire alias Poule, découvre le goût
de l’entreprenariat comme on devient accro au chocolat en respirant ses
effluves. C’est sa rencontre avec Aurélie qui la plongera dans l’aventure,
dans la volonté créatrice avec l’intime conviction qu’elles faisaient
parties de ce groupe qui croyait au pouvoir de leur idée. Il est temps
désormais de s’engager dans ce projet qui est le fruit d’une réelle motivation
en s’appuyant sur ses 7 années d’expériences professionnelles (achat et qualité
chez Airbus Groupe)
Sara  alias l’aventurière, après 16
mois de circumnavigation, il est temps de rentrer à terre et de mettre ses acquis
de navigatrice et de communicante dans un projet professionnel. Après Paris ,
Bogota, l’océan Pacifique, elle pose ses valises à Marseille et c’est tout
naturellement dans un projet nautique qu’elle s’engage.
Léo alias le brésilien, c'est le
Designer de l'équipe, rencontré au start-up week-end de Marseille, en passage
avant de remonter à Paris, ce passionné de sport nautique et
de design aux nombreux talents ne pouvait passer à coté du projet
We-nav.
Nathalie alias Nat a fait ses
classes dans l’hôtellerie et aujourd’hui elle manie avec dextérité les chiffres
dans un univers international. Elle aussi férue de voyages, elle part vivre 1
an au Canada, où elle attrape le gout de l’aventure. Elle embarque dans
cette nouvelle aventure avec la responsabilité d’être garante des finances.

activités nautiques

The concept


Somewhere between Airbnb & Courchsurfing, for all water sports activites.
In a world where sharing and trading goods is part of our everyday economy, it seems like the possibilities are endless.
People share apartments, car space, designer dresses, and even plumbing equipment.
But what about water sports? That's where We-nav comes in.
We-nav has been created to be the website where you can SWAP, HOST, or RENT water sports equipment.
Imagine the possibility of being able to travel half-way around the world and do your favorite water sport with a local, for less.
Or, you can benefit by sharing your time and experiences with someone else who wants to enjoy the same sport you love.

The community
We- nav is, above all, a community that brings together people with a desire to share their common interest in water sports activities including: sailing, motor boating , windsurfing , kite surfing , paddle boarding, rowing, canoeing , fishing, wakeboarding , and everything in between. 
Through our website, we connect people wishing to do water sports in a new location with those who have equipment so they can :

Swap
Host
Rent
Join us on our website www.we-nav.com ( site under construction ) or follow us on our Facebook page and Twitter account.
Our Values
We value the desire to share the love of travel and water sports. So be a part of our fun and adventurous community. 
Where is your money going?
Despite our personal funds, bank loans, and other donations, we're still looking for 20,000 € in order to kickstart We-nav.
The funds we raise will go towards launching our website, creating adds, sponsoring, networking and for your WeMiles/Goodies.
In fact, all donations we receive are not-for-profit, and will go directly towards making this dream a reality.
However, this campaign needs more than just monetary support.
We also need you to be our best ambassador, so spread the word! 
Talk to your friends, family, and colleagues, and invite them to be a part of the We-nav community

                 
                                         

                                       
How WeMiles are working:
More you will share your equipments, or you will sponsor us on the futur website, more you will earn WeMiles.   
The staff


The idea was born when Claire and Aurélie found a fun solution to optimize Aurélie’s boat cost/use ratio. Then on Startup Weekend they met Leo (our designer) & Sara (our communication manager) later Nathalie heard about the poject and join the team as accounting manager.

If you like us, and love the idea, please help us by:
1: Donating.
2: Sending this link to your friends. (@ minimum 3:)
3: Liking our page on Facebook and following us on Twitter 
4: We're looking also for developers, ambassadors... contact us on contact@we-nav.com
We also thank Pierre Broca to ateliernab  for the great video done for We-nav.
Thank you so much! I hope to share some water sports activities with you soon,

<h3>Who is Qulture Collective?</h3>
<p>Qulture Collective will bring together artists, entrepreneurs, activists, and visionaries from queer and allied communities.

<h3>Where is QC &amp; Why?</h3>
<p>Qulture Collective is located at 1714 Franklin Street a few steps away from the 19th Street Bart station. We
 want to create a permanent and visible queer space in the heart of downtown Oakland to keep our presence loud and proud
 in a city that has come to be known for its high concentration of queer
 residents and LGBTQIA focused non-profits and organizations. Oakland's vibrant arts and activism culture also makes the town the ideal location for Qulture Collective. <br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

striving to maintain a consistent, dedicated, safe space and platform for queer 
activity in Oakland. <br/></p>
<blockquote><p>
“As
small business owners ourselves, we are especially interested in promoting a
cycle of support for queer artists and entrepreneurs,” said co-founder and
Oakland native Terry Sok. “We hope that having a space like this will work to
grow multiple businesses and livelihoods.”
<br/></p></blockquote>
<p>Access to a safe space with an atmosphere of inclusion, understanding, and belonging is integral to fostering the creative spirit in an unhindered manner. Having a shared space will allow for the diverse and talented queer and allied community to connect, share stories and promote inspiration and growth. Our hope is that Qulture Collective will be a home base for exciting new activity and innovations.<br/></p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We've got the lease on this amazing space and have begun building it out, but there's a
 lot of work left to be done, and that's where we need your help. The biggest factor that we need help with is raising funds to allow us to complete the build out for the cafe, gallery,
 and the upstairs work spaces. Additional funds are needed to finish furnishing and equipping the 
space to make it comfortable, accessible, and multifunctional, with increased electrical capacity, sound system, and projector. With your help, together we can shape our vision of what a queer collective of small businesses and dedicated community gathering space can be. <br/></p>

</b><p><b>Breakdown of Major Buildout Costs: </b></p>
<p><b>Electrical: $9,000</b></p>
<p><b>Plumbing: $11,000
</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>Cafe Construction, Equipment, Flooring: $23,000</b></p>

<b>
</b><p><b>Additional Equipment (Sound System, Projector, etc.): $2,000</b></p>
<p><b>TOTAL: $50,000</b>
</p>
<p>The cafe portion of the build out is vital to the success of the space because it will be the primary gathering spot for the community. Furthermore, the cafe will generate a steady flow of revenue to cover daily operational costs and allow us to offer in-house events and space rental to the community at affordable prices. The cafe will also act as a backdrop to the other components of the space, in this case our shared workspaces, gallery, and retail areas. <br/></p>
<p>When
 you donate, you'll get to choose from a variety of perks including 
specialty merchandise and gift cards, VIP access to our events, 
special deals for hosting your own events in our space, and a chance to 
have your name on our permanent founders wall! <br/></p>
<p>If
 we do not reach our goal, our main priority will be to fund the major 
construction costs first. However, we do have big plans for the space and raising the full amount will enable us to create something truly above and 
beyond for the queer community in the Oakland and the surrounding Bay Area.</p>

Terry & Julia also own The Garden House, a local 
establishment that has been a fixture in Downtown Oakland for a quarter 
of a century. Together they have developed the small, unassuming space of the old lunch 
spot in a way that supports other small and up and coming 
businesses, artists, and musicians by hosting pop-ups and free community events, while doing their part to preserve
 Oakland's soul and neighborhood love by keeping this small family 
business alive, thriving, and focused on staying true to the longtime residents and workers that have supported the restaurant for many years.

<p><br/>Santiago Sacatepéquez is a small community in the highlands of Guatemala. Founded in 1540 the population of this town is around 30,000, consisting of predominantly indigenous people from the Kaqchikel ethnic group working in agriculture and commerce. Poverty is around 49% and illiteracy 25%. Some years ago this town was considered to be a rural area, but metropolitan growth has extended these areas making our town of Santiago a semi-rural one, in dire need of development and the building of further infrastructure to support our growing community. Moreover our town lacks the municipal funds needed from the local government to construct a main communal road, so we have been forced to raise money in every way we can to improve the condition of one of our communities major transport routes. Even though we are going through this tough situation, Santiago has several tourist attractions including the Giant Kite Festival, where its people unite and organize themselves to celebrate this local community event each year.</p>
<p>For the mainly indigenous people in our community, the Giant Kite Festival, celebrated on November 1st every year is a great way to work together celebrating an important part of our culture and strengthening communal bonds. This festival has been celebrated for some 116 years and families participating design and create giant multicolored kites (see picture above). Kites can range from 15cms to 15mts long, and some years they have created kites as big as 20mts in diameter. The colorful kites are made in communal spaces or in municipal schools and  are flown on the municipal cemetery grounds to the enjoyment of both locals and foreigners alike.</p>

<p>Nous tenons à terminer la construction de cette route. Pendant de nombreuses années, les habitants
ont demandé aux autorités municipales de résoudre ce problème, mais la ville manque

<p>Il est difficile de mesurer réellement l'impact de ce projet dans notre

créer un changement positif dans la vie des habitants. Nous avons vu les
améliorations que nous avons faites sur la route actuelle et lesquelles ont apportées
une vie meilleure pour les enfants et les adultes dans cette première phase.
Cette route importante aura un impact positif sur l'environnement de la
communauté et les interactions avec des secteurs publics et privés sont un
symbole de développement nécessaire au Guatemala. La construction de cette
route avec nos propres ressources et l'assistance, donnera également un sens de
l'autonomisation des citoyens de notre communauté et nous fournir un exemple de

cette petite ville apportant de l'énergie renouvelée  et des opportunités nouvelles  pour habitants.
Pour  construire la route on a besoin
d’unte totale de US$  90,000 et avec le
soutien des entreprises et des individus dans la région nous avons réussi à
recueillir US $ 70,000. Par conséquent, nous avons  besoin 
encore US $ 20.000. Guatemala a
vécu les  conditions politiques et économiques
très difficiles. Bon nombre des problèmes n’ont pas été prise en considération  par les autorités. Dans cette situation, la
construction d'une petite route est loin d'être une priorité pour le
gouvernement local et national. Cependant, les habitants  ont attendu longtemps et maintenant sont  proches de la faire une réalité!
Vous pouvez nous aider en nous donnant US $10 ou plus. Peu à peu, nous
recueillerons ce que nous avons besoin et, bien sûr, nous avons pensé à des
récompenses pour les personnes qui soutiennent notre cause vous pourriez être
intéressé de voir la section des récompenses.
Bien sûr, il y a la possibilité que nous ne recevions pas tout l'argent nécessaire.  Dans ce cas, la construction de cette route
pourrait prendre plus de temps et les voisins devront  rapporter le travail et assumer les risques
et les tracas d'avoir une route en mauvais état.
Dans notre esprit, nous pouvons voir un chemin propre et fini où les
enfants peuvent aller à l'école et les habitants peuvent aller travailler
chaque jour sans inconvénient. Nous avons un mois de plus pour aller à la
recherche de différents possibilités 
pour recueillir de l'argent,  -
nous faisons déjà des bingos, des tombolas 
et  des autres événements. D'une certaine manière nous avons mis notre
objectif de collecter tout l'argent dont nous avons besoin. Nous prévoyons
d'ouvrir notre nouveau chemin le 1 Novembre.
Impact
Jusqu'à présent, les voisins ont senti l’impuissance devant le manque
d'intérêt municipal. Nous avons simplement prié pour que les autorités
municipales prennent  le relais, sans
succès. Cependant, comme une force unie, nous sommes sur le point de finir le
travail. Votre contribution à ce rêve serait appréciée et utile et nous
aiderons  aider avoir chemin propre et
sans  danger pour tout le monde.
Il est difficile de mesurer réellement l'impact de ce projet dans notre
société et notre pays. Pourtant, nous pouvons dire honnêtement que ce travail a
créer un changement positif dans la vie des habitants. Nous avons vu les
améliorations que nous avons faites sur la route actuelle et lesquelles ont apportées
une vie meilleure pour les enfants et les adultes dans cette première phase.
Cette route importante aura un impact positif sur l'environnement de la
communauté et les interactions avec des secteurs publics et privés sont un
symbole de développement nécessaire au Guatemala. La construction de cette
route avec nos propres ressources et l'assistance, donnera également un sens de
l'autonomisation des citoyens de notre communauté et nous fournir un exemple de
bonne pratique de la façon dont nous pouvons prendre en charge nos affaires communautaires  et de contribuer au développement soutenable.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

 Opportunity for artists to create in a safe, nurturing environment. 
Opportunity for different mediums and disciplines to collaborate and 
exchange ideas. Opportunity for the audience to encounter the art, the 
artist, and have a successful dialogue with them. <b><i>Opportunity to get an artist the big break they've worked so hard for.</i></b>  What exactly is <b>The Ginny B</b>? Great question!

I met her in the bitter cold winter of 2010 in Tribeca doing a rather lack-luster production of <i>Macbeth</i> wherein she played Lady M. Ginny's Scottish Queen was sublime, and I wanted to meet her, so after the matinee I invited her to lunch. </p>She was warm, caring, friendly, enthusiastic, genuine, and full of a grace seen rarely and only by those who're truly humble. There was a fire in her eyes that beheld a little mischief, a little angel, and a whole lot of personality. I knew from that moment that we would be creative partners in crime, and invited her to a full production of <i>Macbeth</i> with our Off-Off Broadway team, Redd Tale Theatre Company.<br/><br/><h3>Creation</h3><p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249751/files/20150225181549-Macbeth___Lady_M.jpg?1424916949"" src="""" style=""width: 156.305px; height: 234px;""/>That season we did two shows in rep and Ginny played two lead characters. Not once did she falter nor complain about the line load. Virginia was dedicated to the craft, always brought her best, and worked with me as her director to create critically acclaimed performances in both shows. Ginny's work garnered her a <b>New York Innovative Theatre Award Nomination</b> (The Oscars of the Off-Off Broadway world) for <b>Outstanding Actress in a Lead Role</b> as Lady Macbeth. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249733/files/20150225180453-GinnyBook.jpg?1424916293"" src="""" style=""width: 273.707px; height: 181px;""/>During that time Ginny was workshopping her one-woman piece <i>Modern Prometheus: Frankenstein with Mary Shelley</i>. The piece told the of story <i>Frankenstein</i> through the lenses of Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein, and the nameless Creation. I was so taken aback by how brilliant it was, I offered to put it up the next season. We spent the year working together and honed the piece. All of that hard work paid off once again, as Ginny <b>won Best Adaptation </b>for the <b>United Solo Theatre Festival </b>in 2012.<b> </b><br/></p><h3>Insidious<br/>
</h3>What we didn't know, was that back in 2010, while she worked on her Lady M., the pain that started in her hip and began to worsen over the next two years was in fact a tumor. When it got too much to bear, she got it imaged by an orthopedist. From there she was immediately admitted to <b>Memorial </b><b>Sloan Kettering Cancer Center </b>in NYC where she was diagnosed with cancer that had started in her hip bone, muscles, and nerves, and would quickly spread to her major organs, and spine.<br/><br/><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249749/files/20150225181423-VIRGINIA_BARTHOLOMEW_HEADSHOT.jpg?1424916863"" src="""" style=""width: 347.632px; height: 231px;""/> It was aggressive, so the doctors would be as well. It was to be one hell of a battle. I visited her several times at the hospital, and at home multiple times. The last time I saw her, she was in pain, but smiling, loving, and asked me how I was doing before I even had a chance to ask her. She fought hard, but in the end the cancer was too far advanced and she succumbed to the illness. <br/><br/>Virginia, Ginny, passed April 22, 2013 at 11:11am surrounded by her family.<br/><p></p><h3>Silence</h3>About two weeks before she passed, her fiance, Jim Tolisano, was at home and her phone rang. He answered: It was her agent. She asked if she could speak with Virginia, and when asked why, she replied that Ginny had landed auditions for lead roles in three major motion pictures.<br/><br/>She'd made it.<br/><br/>Ginny was so close... SO close to hitting her big break. All that hard work, the hours sifting through the dailies, audition after audition, workshop after workshop... All of that work, only to be recognized too late.<br/><br/><h3>Deep Breath<br/>
</h3>I spent months mourning, and as I did, one thought kept ticking over and over again in my mind: How can more opportunities be available for artists? What can be created so artists can be recognized earlier and avoid recreating Virginia's tragedy?<br/><br/>Whenever Ginny would find something that struck her creatively, or she experienced a moment of awe, she would breathe in, and revel in the inspiration. And that's when I got <i>my</i> inspiration, gleaned from her life, her work, her struggle...

scratch. They are <a href=""#Art"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Ginny B Arts Centre</a> and <a href=""#Life"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Residences @ The Ginny B</a>.
 They'll be on the same grounds, and accessible by a short walk. Each 
are three stories tall,  over 15,000 sq. ft., and dedicated to

The first floor entry way brings you into our <b>Cafe/Lobby</b>.

At the back wall is the proscenium of <b>The Stage</b>, a versatile 40 foot wide, 30 foot deep, and 20 foot tall beauty that can easily house concerts and performances, and features a removable projection screen for film showings!

</h3><b>The Ginny B</b> believes that in order to succeed, it will need the support of the local community, and promises to give back to them in return. In the spirit of radical inclusiveness, <b>The Ginny B</b> will create <b>two main outreach programs</b> to be of service to the community it settles in.<br/><br/><h3>Young Artist Program <br/>
</h3><b>The Ginny B</b>’s mission is to <b>give back</b> to the community with <b>free education</b> in the arts. The program is three months long, and each art form will consist of two weekend-long classes (eight hours per day) with 30 students each. The six divisions of the <b>Young Artist Program</b> are: <br/><br/>Art <br/>Music <br/>Literature <br/>Theatre <br/>Dance <br/>Film/Visual Media <br/><br/>The <b>Young Artists Program</b> will service low-income and impoverished communities that have little to no access to art programs. The students will be given a free three-month arts education at <b>The Ginny B</b>, and will work with teachers to create pieces of art from each of these mediums. Topics covered include: History, Iconic Artists, Cultural Influences, World Wide Studies, and Modern Day Examples. In addition, the students will be invited to one event for free held during the given art taught. Week one will take them to the galleries to interact with the Artists in Residence recipients. Week two the students will be invited to a concert night of jazz or open mic, and so on, through out their education. <br/><br/>The <b>Young Artists Program</b> is asking for $200,000 per art medium to fund students for <b>five years</b>. This will cover the tuition for 120 students per year, the fee for three teachers per art medium, materials, cost of each event, and space rental. Each student is selected by a lottery of submissions, and can only attend once.<br/><br/><h3>PFLAG</h3>In addition to supporting the arts, <b>The Ginny B</b> will also dedicate a weekly space and create its own <b>PFLAG</b> (Parents and Friends of Lesbians And Gays) <b>Chapter</b>. As important as it is to provide a safe place for art to be created, this organization also believes it is just as important to foster and support the LGBTQ community, with many going on to create amazing pieces of art. Any and all are welcome at the <b>PFLAG</b> events who support those in attendance. <br/><br/><h3>Cancer Research</h3><b>The Ginny B</b> also pledges a percentage of our ticket sales to <b>Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center</b> in Seattle to help fund their endeavors to find a cure!<br/>

At this most fundamental level, <b>The Ginny B</b> anticipates getting the actual facilities built within three to five years. That's why this organization is aiming for the next milestone: $500,000.<br/><br/><p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290083/files/20150312105122-GinnyYello.jpg?1426182682"" src="""" style=""width: 212px; height: 318px;""/>At <b>$500,000</b>, <b>The Ginny B</b> will be able to parse out monies into three groups: <b>The Infrastructure Fund</b> will be able to hire a few more staff for the core administrative group thus allowing for the potential of more funds coming in. <b>The Facility Fund</b> will be responsible for putting down 20% on a New Construction Loan to build the first, and most important, building, <b>The Ginny B Arts Centre</b>. Finally, the <b>Future Fund</b> will allow the organization to create its first productions, hold opening galas and fundraisers in the building, and work toward building the residences!<br/></p><br/><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290121/files/20150312105907-GinnyYellow.jpg?1426183147"" src="""" style=""width: 118px; height: 177px;""/><p></p><b>The Ginny B</b>'s third milestone, <b>$1,000,000 </b>will take the organization much much further.

Right out of the gate $2,000,000 will be put toward construction costs and avoid using a loan (therefore making the cost of building cheaper). Staffing will be funded through the first year, creating the administration that will take <b>The Ginny B</b> through to the next level. The<b> Artist in Residence Program </b>will be fully paid for their first year of operation. And, lastly, put $1,750,000 aside to keep the community programs running for their first two years!<br/></p><a name=""Donation"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><br/><h3>Donation Levels<br/>
</h3><b>The Ginny B</b>'s goal is to partner with individual donors, foundations, and corporate sponsorships to fund this massive project. <br/><br/>Each perk benefits <b>The Ginny B</b>, with some having the opportunity to personally name parts of the building with your generous donation. Ranging from simple items such as tickets to shows, to dedicating a chair in the auditorium to a friend, all the way up to sponsoring the whole <b>Artists in Residence Program</b> and everything in between! Because this organization will need the support of the community, each piece of the building will belong, in name, to them. <b>The Ginny B</b>
 will be a shining example of how collaboration of arts and community 
can create a lasting organization with a world-wide vision.

Ginny's StoryAbout the FacilityHelping the CommunityHow You Can Support The Ginny BInformation on Donation LevelsThank YouFAQ'sPurposeThe Ginny B is about providing opportunity:
 Opportunity for artists to create in a safe, nurturing environment. 
Opportunity for different mediums and disciplines to collaborate and 
exchange ideas. Opportunity for the audience to encounter the art, the 
artist, and have a successful dialogue with them. Opportunity to get an artist the big break they've worked so hard for.  What exactly is The Ginny B? Great question! Here's our story!A Light in the DarkVirginia Bartholomew, ""Ginny,"" as she was known to her friends and family, was a phenomenal actress and playwright based in NYC and had begun to spread her wings in the Off-Off Broadway world. I met her in the bitter cold winter of 2010 in Tribeca doing a rather lack-luster production of Macbeth wherein she played Lady M. Ginny's Scottish Queen was sublime, and I wanted to meet her, so after the matinee I invited her to lunch. She was warm, caring, friendly, enthusiastic, genuine, and full of a grace seen rarely and only by those who're truly humble. There was a fire in her eyes that beheld a little mischief, a little angel, and a whole lot of personality. I knew from that moment that we would be creative partners in crime, and invited her to a full production of Macbeth with our Off-Off Broadway team, Redd Tale Theatre Company.CreationThat season we did two shows in rep and Ginny played two lead characters. Not once did she falter nor complain about the line load. Virginia was dedicated to the craft, always brought her best, and worked with me as her director to create critically acclaimed performances in both shows. Ginny's work garnered her a New York Innovative Theatre Award Nomination (The Oscars of the Off-Off Broadway world) for Outstanding Actress in a Lead Role as Lady Macbeth. During that time Ginny was workshopping her one-woman piece Modern Prometheus: Frankenstein with Mary Shelley. The piece told the of story Frankenstein through the lenses of Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein, and the nameless Creation. I was so taken aback by how brilliant it was, I offered to put it up the next season. We spent the year working together and honed the piece. All of that hard work paid off once again, as Ginny won Best Adaptation for the United Solo Theatre Festival in 2012. Insidious
What we didn't know, was that back in 2010, while she worked on her Lady M., the pain that started in her hip and began to worsen over the next two years was in fact a tumor. When it got too much to bear, she got it imaged by an orthopedist. From there she was immediately admitted to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in NYC where she was diagnosed with cancer that had started in her hip bone, muscles, and nerves, and would quickly spread to her major organs, and spine. It was aggressive, so the doctors would be as well. It was to be one hell of a battle. I visited her several times at the hospital, and at home multiple times. The last time I saw her, she was in pain, but smiling, loving, and asked me how I was doing before I even had a chance to ask her. She fought hard, but in the end the cancer was too far advanced and she succumbed to the illness. Virginia, Ginny, passed April 22, 2013 at 11:11am surrounded by her family.SilenceAbout two weeks before she passed, her fiance, Jim Tolisano, was at home and her phone rang. He answered: It was her agent. She asked if she could speak with Virginia, and when asked why, she replied that Ginny had landed auditions for lead roles in three major motion pictures.She'd made it.Ginny was so close... SO close to hitting her big break. All that hard work, the hours sifting through the dailies, audition after audition, workshop after workshop... All of that work, only to be recognized too late.Deep Breath
I spent months mourning, and as I did, one thought kept ticking over and over again in my mind: How can more opportunities be available for artists? What can be created so artists can be recognized earlier and avoid recreating Virginia's tragedy?Whenever Ginny would find something that struck her creatively, or she experienced a moment of awe, she would breathe in, and revel in the inspiration. And that's when I got my inspiration, gleaned from her life, her work, her struggle... My Ginspiration: Create what is now known as -  
The Ginny B
Here's how it'll work:The Ginny B  will consist of two main buildings that will be 
created from scratch. Yes, you read that right, two new buildings, from 
scratch. They are The Ginny B Arts Centre and The Residences @ The Ginny B.
 They'll be on the same grounds, and accessible by a short walk. Each 
are three stories tall,  over 15,000 sq. ft., and dedicated to 
supporting artists, audience, and community. These mock-ups are based off of feasibility designs from our architect who specializes in shipping container buildings (the grey blocks on the sides of the building).ArtThe Ginny B Arts Centre is designed to bring people back again and again through new exhibits, performances, our Young Artists Program, and events on a regular rotating schedule. The first floor entry way brings you into our Cafe/Lobby. There, artists and audience will have the opportunity to sit face to face, interact, collaborate, and network freely. Through the lobby you enter the Auditorium which houses retractable theatrical seating so that the floor is accessible to rent out for events or large gatherings. At the back wall is the proscenium of The Stage, a versatile 40 foot wide, 30 foot deep, and 20 foot tall beauty that can easily house concerts and performances, and features a removable projection screen for film showings! Walk up the ramps to the Balcony where The Ginny B can house smaller events or gatherings and have changeable seating for The Stage events. Then, you ascend to the third floor: The Galleries. The Galleries will house nine artists at once; Eight for the Artist In Residence Program, and one central one for a larger installation of a popular current artist. The back of the galleries leads to the roof of The Stage, which will be an outdoor sculpture garden/retreat to bring a coffee and enjoy the fresh Seattle air. LifeThe Residences @ The Ginny B is similar in structure, but diverges as soon as you enter the building. The first floor is The Laboratory: six spaces of varying size, from a simple 10'x10' room for small meetings or rehearsals, to a 40'x30' performance hall for workshopping new pieces. There is a state of the art recording studio on hand so that musicians can lay down an album and a film editing studio for budding directors and actors to create!The second and third floors are built exactly the same, accessible via private entry, with dual purposes: The second floor is for our Artist In Residence Program. The third floor is dedicated to a year-long Artists Housing Program, where we invite eight artists to stay at The Ginny B in our low-cost housing. They will pay a reduced rent to The Ginny B, and have access to our facilities and perks for a whole year. On top of all of that is a 5,000 sq. foot roof top deck that will be solar paneled. Community 
The Ginny B believes that in order to succeed, it will need the support of the local community, and promises to give back to them in return. In the spirit of radical inclusiveness, The Ginny B will create two main outreach programs to be of service to the community it settles in.Young Artist Program 
The Ginny B’s mission is to give back to the community with free education in the arts. The program is three months long, and each art form will consist of two weekend-long classes (eight hours per day) with 30 students each. The six divisions of the Young Artist Program are: Art Music Literature Theatre Dance Film/Visual Media The Young Artists Program will service low-income and impoverished communities that have little to no access to art programs. The students will be given a free three-month arts education at The Ginny B, and will work with teachers to create pieces of art from each of these mediums. Topics covered include: History, Iconic Artists, Cultural Influences, World Wide Studies, and Modern Day Examples. In addition, the students will be invited to one event for free held during the given art taught. Week one will take them to the galleries to interact with the Artists in Residence recipients. Week two the students will be invited to a concert night of jazz or open mic, and so on, through out their education. The Young Artists Program is asking for $200,000 per art medium to fund students for five years. This will cover the tuition for 120 students per year, the fee for three teachers per art medium, materials, cost of each event, and space rental. Each student is selected by a lottery of submissions, and can only attend once.PFLAGIn addition to supporting the arts, The Ginny B will also dedicate a weekly space and create its own PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians And Gays) Chapter. As important as it is to provide a safe place for art to be created, this organization also believes it is just as important to foster and support the LGBTQ community, with many going on to create amazing pieces of art. Any and all are welcome at the PFLAG events who support those in attendance. Cancer ResearchThe Ginny B also pledges a percentage of our ticket sales to Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle to help fund their endeavors to find a cure!
SupportSince every cent donated goes directly into creating The Ginny B, lets show you how our Fundraising Goals break down:The first milestone, $250,000, will hire the core staff for The Ginny B to begin seeking larger donations from corporations, grant and foundational monies, while also establishing direct relationships with the community. At this most fundamental level, The Ginny B anticipates getting the actual facilities built within three to five years. That's why this organization is aiming for the next milestone: $500,000.At $500,000, The Ginny B will be able to parse out monies into three groups: The Infrastructure Fund will be able to hire a few more staff for the core administrative group thus allowing for the potential of more funds coming in. The Facility Fund will be responsible for putting down 20% on a New Construction Loan to build the first, and most important, building, The Ginny B Arts Centre. Finally, the Future Fund will allow the organization to create its first productions, hold opening galas and fundraisers in the building, and work toward building the residences!The Ginny B's third milestone, $1,000,000 will take the organization much much further. Not only will it cover the hiring of full time staff, but also put down a larger dollar amount toward a New Construction Loan and build both structures, while also setting aside a larger portion toward the Future Fund and kick off the opening of The Ginny B with gusto!Lastly, the biggest, and best milestone, $5,000,000, will fund the entire project! Right out of the gate $2,000,000 will be put toward construction costs and avoid using a loan (therefore making the cost of building cheaper). Staffing will be funded through the first year, creating the administration that will take The Ginny B through to the next level. The Artist in Residence Program will be fully paid for their first year of operation. And, lastly, put $1,750,000 aside to keep the community programs running for their first two years!Donation Levels
The Ginny B's goal is to partner with individual donors, foundations, and corporate sponsorships to fund this massive project. Each perk benefits The Ginny B, with some having the opportunity to personally name parts of the building with your generous donation. Ranging from simple items such as tickets to shows, to dedicating a chair in the auditorium to a friend, all the way up to sponsoring the whole Artists in Residence Program and everything in between! Because this organization will need the support of the community, each piece of the building will belong, in name, to them. The Ginny B
 will be a shining example of how collaboration of arts and community 
can create a lasting organization with a world-wide vision. Here is a list of items for purchase, and their sponsor level:With each donation you will also receive a Supporter Level, and they entitle you to some pretty amazing perks! Check them out below! Supporter Perks:

<div>A little about Guatemala Housing Alliance:   We are a small, 3 year old non-profit serving those living in the most extreme poverty in Guatemala.   We build homes and provide scholarships and extracurricular opportunities.   All administrative costs are paid by the Board of Directors, so every penny donated directly funds projects.</div>
</div></div>","This is the home of a family of 8 in San Pablo La Laguna in the highlands of Guatemala.   The family has rented this home for 14 years, since the death of the father.   There are 2 rooms, each about 8x10', and a small cooking area with an unvented stove.  The porous roof invites the rain to enter as do the walls, made variously of plastic, cornstalks and rotted metal.Each room has one bed, leaving 4 people to sleep on the dirt, sometimes mud, floor each night.        Both Candelaria, the matriarch, and her 30 year old daughter Clara sell peanuts in the streets for which they earn barely $1.50/day.   Clara's boyfriend, sometimes with help from the children, gather and sell firewoods to bring in a little money.  The 4 younger children go to school...with the help of scholarships from GHA.

      We need your help to house this family with security and dignity.   Guatemala Housing Alliance builds homes that are modest by US standards, 17'x18', 2 rooms, with secure doors and windows.   You can imagine the palace it would seem to this family.   Still, one is not really large enough for a family this size

       An incredibly generous donor contributed the money to buy this family a piece of land large enough for 2 of our homes.   This week the land was surveyed and divided, and the titles put in the names of the two women.  Clara, Francisco and Clara's two children will inhabit one, Candelaria and her 3 other children will have the second.
    So, this is what we need to build each house:
House construction:  $2340    Yes, it seems incredible that so little can offer such                                                           security for a family
2 bunks and mattresses:  $300 per house
Pila:   cast cement sink for washing clothes and dishes:  $70
Wood conserving, vented cookstove:  $125
Latrine:  $70
Fence:   needed near escarpment  $70
Solar Electric with cell, battery, inverter, and installation:  $225   Hooking up to the                          electric company is not an option on this property.   With children                                     attempting to study, we feel electricity is important.


A total of $3200


Please help.  While this fundraiser is for one home, any extra money earned will go to funding a second.

<p>
Aionio
is an environmentally conscious manufacturer of funerary urns. Our
beautiful products are made purely from recycled newspapers and
handcrafted by underprivileged families from one of the poorest areas
in the Philippines. Aionio’s cottage industry workshop is located
right in the heart of the community. In this way we try to provide an
income and self-sustainability to improve the lives of everyone in
the area. Our ultimate goal is to create a fully self-sustaining
Aionio Subsidized Community.

<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>Aionio’s
Products are 100% Biodegradable</b><br/>Our
beautiful, handcrafted funerary urns are made from recycled
newspapers as the raw material combined with a formula that makes
them fully biodegradable. This means they are ideal for sea burials
and for use in any critical burial sites, leaving only fond, loving

<h3>Unmet Request for Emergency Shelter<br/>
</h3> <p>In 2014, there were more than 14,800 unmet requests for shelter in 
Texas. What happens when the victim of domestic violence doesn't have anywhere to go? Most return to the home of abuse. Some end up homeless. Others turn to darker options. <i>Children from these broken homes are 60% more likely to repeat the cycle of domestic violence when they grow up.</i></p>

<li>
<b>The nearest shelter is too far away.</b> This is a common problem for small towns and large cities with full shelters. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>The local shelter went out of business.</b> Remember that budget sequestration from 
2013? Shelters lost funding forcing some to close, and never reopened.</li>
<li>
<b>The person seeking help doesn't qualify. </b>Being a man, being LGBT, having teenage sons to shelter, wanting to take a pet- these are some of the reasons people get denied shelter.<br/>
