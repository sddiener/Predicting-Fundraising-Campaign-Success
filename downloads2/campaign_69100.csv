Around the dog park, we are going to have tables and seats where you can have some food, drinks, music, and a great time guaranteed.

<p>Everyone with a motorcycle will need to work on their bike at some point. Many of them want to do the work themselves, but don't have the space for it. Some can't afford or make room for the large lifts or other specialty equipment needed for some tasks.</p>
<p>The motorcycling community is also full of unique, creative individuals who are left wanting for cool, relaxing, and fun places to hang out that have an atmosphere and vibe that actually caters to the moto-enthusiast first and foremost.</p>
<p>That's where Union Motorcycle Company comes in, at the junction of these two roads. Union Moto is out to create an innovative community garage, café, and lounge space. It will be inviting and unique, offering up an unmatched experience where motorcyclists (and the moto-curious) can congregate, work on their bikes, learn from one another, and have a good time. We will have a café and storefront open to all, where hot and cold drinks (and some snacks) will be available, as well as merch from Union and our partners and a curated selection of retail products.</p>
<p>Membership to the community garage and the members' lounge is what it's really all about, though. We'll offer three tiers of membership (Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master), as well as day passes, with greater benefits unlocked with each tier. Members will have access to our garage, secure storage, members-only lounge, discounts, swag, and other perks. The garage will be fully stocked with workstations complete with tools, lifts and stands, tire changing equipment, disposal facilities for fluids and tires, and more. It will give DIY riders, customizers, and builders access to workspaces and equipment they would not otherwise have, in a cost-effective manner that will appeal to their practical side (for instance, someone could be a Union Moto member at the ""Journeyman"" level for $50/month for three years by the time they've paid out the cost of a single premium hydraulic lift at upwards of $1800). The lounge, in keeping with the DIY attitude of the place, will feature a brew-it-yourself coffee bar with complementary coffee (and other drinks and refreshments) for members.</p>
<p>For members who seek education; to learn new skills and build the confidence to tackle harder jobs, the lounge will be home to an ever-growing library of resource material. When available, there will also be staff to provide consultations, assistance, and labor (at a fee) for customers. There will also be other members across all skill levels to talk to and learn from, so we can build an inspirational environment where the motorcycling community can grow and thrive.</p>
<p>The goal is to cultivate an atmosphere unlike anything else, to reflect the DIY ethos of motorcycling at its finest, and welcome any and all riders of anything with two wheels and a motor.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are Nicole and Brooke: a wife and wife team who believe strongly in the big power of a little button. We're based out of Grass Valley, CA and have a 2 year old son and a newborn baby girl. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds to help us achieve our goal of expanding our business. We've put everything we had into it when we started and we've already outgrown ourselves, limiting what we can do and orders we can take. We need help to purchase more equipment for larger jobs. Since we're a two person team right now, we're at full capacity. </p>
<p>With your help, we'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase more equipment for more product diversity and larger jobs. </li>
<li>Any additional funds we raise will go into marketing and upgrading our website to make it easier for you to build and order custom buttons. </li>
</ul>
<p>We want to thank you for your support by giving you some awesome goodies! Make sure to check out the different options. If you'd like to help, but don't want the perks, there's an option for that. You can also let us know if you'd like us to donate your perks to a local non-profit that helps LGBT+ youth in our county instead. They'll be able to use the gift certificates to purchase items to help them raise money for their programs. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our main goal is to be able to provide fundraising opportunities for organizations by providing them with low-cost buttons to use to promote awareness or sell. We also would like to help other small shop owners by providing them with a low-cost way to make a profit.  To do this we need a little help with funds to be able to renovate our workspace and get equipment that will streamline our process. </p>

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>I’m Sara Brown, the visionary (and occasional dishwasher) behind Rutabagas. I’m a born-and-bred Lincoln girl, so I have a whole lot of pride for this community of ours.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I transitioned from a traditional omnivore diet to a diet based primarily on plants. I quickly realized there was an urgent need in Lincoln for vegan food options – both convenience-based options (pre-made grab &amp; go dishes) and sit-down restaurant experiences.</p>
<p>I’ve always had a passion for cooking and nourishing others. Last summer, I combined that love with the business skills I’ve developed over the years and launched the first phase of Rutabagas.</p>
<p>That first phase included lots of recipe testing. We solicited tons of feedback from friends, family and customers to make sure each dish was up to snuff. We provided individual and family-style meals for pick-up and delivery, and we “popped up” all over town with our soon-to-be-world-famous nachos. In one short year, we developed an extensive, diverse menu and grew a massive following of passionate supporters. We’re on FIRE!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>We’re beyond excited to launch the second phase.</h3>
<p><strong>Since the start, the secret ingredient to Rutabagas' success has been you.</strong> We’re raising $10,000 over the next 30 days to get us even closer to opening the doors to the first-ever Rutabagas restaurant. These funds will pay for high-quality, durable kitchen equipment, furniture and fixtures. (Think of this as your chance to fund the oven used to make your very favorite chocolate chip cookies!)</p>
<p><strong>Your investment will impact our community (and the world) in so many ways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to source as much food from local farmers and producers as possible to stimulate the local economy.</li>
<li>We’ll create tons of jobs for Lincoln’s diverse, vibrant workforce.</li>
<li>One of our top priorities is becoming a zero-waste company as soon as possible. We want to ensure we’re impacting our planet as minimally as possible.</li>
<li>We use 0 animal products in our dishes, which lessens our carbon footprint in countless ways, including less water usage, no methane gas production and more.</li>
<li>We’ve cultivated an inclusive environment where meat-eaters, plant-eaters and crayon-eaters alike can fill their bellies and their souls together. However you eat, you’ll love how Rutabagas makes you feel physically and spiritually.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If you can’t help out financially, we totally understand. There are many other ways you can help! Two of the most important ways:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word about this campaign by sharing it through your social media channels. Snap it, ‘gram it, tweet it – pick your poison and share, share, share!</li>
<li>Come visit us once our doors are finally open! We can’t wait to fill your belly and your heart.</li>

<p>About</p>
<p>The goal of The Eisenhower is to redefine the vacation rental experience.  I was sick of the cookie-cutter approach that many owners are employing when they put a rental on the market. This approach is boring and forgets one of the primary reasons WHY people utilize platforms like Airbnb and VRBO...uniqueness of the space. The Eisenhower is different. It combines a love of the local art and culture that is so prominent in Scottsdale with the status of a modern boutique hotel. To make The Eisenhower a reality I brought on a talented and published local designer, an amazing general contractor, multiple local artists, and a proven marketing team to help me complete this project. </p>

<p>Scottsdale's Eisenhower, a two-bedroom/one bath condo, is located within the apartment structure, ""Americana."" Built-in 1958, the Americana is one of 14 Garden Style Apartment complexes situated in the shadow of the Valley Ho Hotel.  Garden Apartments gained in popularity in the '50s, and '60s because they were quick to build and well suited to the climate of Southern California and Arizona. Garden Apartments also catered to a growing percentage of young Americans whose appreciation for indoor/outdoor living began to take hold.</p>

<p><i>Enjoying the amenities of The Americana complex</i></p>
<p>The Americana and the 13 other complexes are considered the predecessors to the modern boutique hotels we currently enjoy in America. The unique location of The Eisenhower, within the Garden Apartments Historic District, provided an opportunity to hold true to the classic mid-century design of the space, but bring in relevant features of modern Scottsdale. The Eisenhower will feature the amenities and trappings of a stylish boutique hotel and in a location that allows all our guests to feel immersed in the vibrant culture of Scottsdale. A city that we love very much.</p>

<p><i>Future guest admiring the work-in-progress.</i></p>
<p>Our goal is to have The Eisenhower be the first of many new vacation rentals. More specifically, vacation rentals that bring back the essence of why someone would want to visit...the uniqueness of the space and the connection to the local culture. </p>

<p><i>Thought-provoking design focused on inspiring our guests.</i></p>
<p>We have a goal of opening The Eisenhower by October 2019, which is why we need your help. To complete The Eisenhower's remodel and bring in the furnishings a guest would expect of a historically significant boutique rental space, I need $9,000. We will use these funds to finish remodeling efforts in the bedrooms, the bathroom, and the kitchen. We will furnish the space in a way that is fiscally responsible and focused on function, intentionality &amp; balance. We aren't trying to create something trendy, we are trying to create something special.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Several key risks remain with the project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Final remodeling phases (Bathroom, Kitchen, Bedrooms)</li>
<li>Furniture</li>
<li>Interior decorating</li>
<li>Final design features</li>
<li>Marketing campaign </li>
</ol>
<p>The funds that you graciously contribute will go toward the completion of tile in the bathroom and kitchen, lighting fixtures, and final features such as counter-tops, waterfall dinette table, and oak shelving. Continuing to work closely with our general contractor and key tradesman, we do not foresee any delays in finishing the final remodeling phases.</p>
<p>Furniture has already been identified from a mixture of local providers with the intent to add a combination of comfort and style to the space. Additionally, Tony has already laid out a plan for the final interior-design aspect of the project that will focus on the small details that are often overlooked but are critical for success: bold colors, local artwork, and boutique tile-designs. This final phase will be executed upon completion of the remodeling phase.</p>
<p>I have partnered with <a href=""https://www.voyagepro.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.voyagepro.co/</a> to handle key marketing aspects such as video promotions, photography, and social media accounts. With a proven partner like <a href=""https://www.voyagepro.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.voyagepro.co/</a> I will be able to showcase The Eisenhower to the world in an efficient and all-encompassing manner.</p>
<p>With your help, any potential risks to a grand opening of October 1st are completely mitigated. We have the plan, the people, and the motivation. With your final assistance, The Eisenhower will be available to showcase the best of Scottsdale to the world.</p>

A city that we love very much.

Bringing the Scottsdale art-vibe into a space where guests can enjoy the local culture within an intimate setting.

Future guest admiring the work-in-progress.
Our goal is to have The Eisenhower be the first of many new vacation rentals. More specifically, vacation rentals that bring back the essence of why someone would want to visit...the uniqueness of the space and the connection to the local culture. 

Thought-provoking design focused on inspiring our guests.
We have a goal of opening The Eisenhower by October 2019, which is why we need your help. To complete The Eisenhower's remodel and bring in the furnishings a guest would expect of a historically significant boutique rental space, I need $9,000. We will use these funds to finish remodeling efforts in the bedrooms, the bathroom, and the kitchen. We will furnish the space in a way that is fiscally responsible and focused on function, intentionality & balance. We aren't trying to create something trendy, we are trying to create something special.

Bathroom in-progress

Hallway and Office Nook
Risks and challenges
Several key risks remain with the project:

Final remodeling phases (Bathroom, Kitchen, Bedrooms)
Furniture
Interior decorating
Final design features
Marketing campaign 

The funds that you graciously contribute will go toward the completion of tile in the bathroom and kitchen, lighting fixtures, and final features such as counter-tops, waterfall dinette table, and oak shelving. Continuing to work closely with our general contractor and key tradesman, we do not foresee any delays in finishing the final remodeling phases.
Furniture has already been identified from a mixture of local providers with the intent to add a combination of comfort and style to the space. Additionally, Tony has already laid out a plan for the final interior-design aspect of the project that will focus on the small details that are often overlooked but are critical for success: bold colors, local artwork, and boutique tile-designs. This final phase will be executed upon completion of the remodeling phase.
I have partnered with https://www.voyagepro.co/ to handle key marketing aspects such as video promotions, photography, and social media accounts. With a proven partner like https://www.voyagepro.co/ I will be able to showcase The Eisenhower to the world in an efficient and all-encompassing manner.
With your help, any potential risks to a grand opening of October 1st are completely mitigated. We have the plan, the people, and the motivation. With your final assistance, The Eisenhower will be available to showcase the best of Scottsdale to the world.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>ADVH has created this campaign to help raise the funds necessary to begin a breadfruit flour production site. We already own the land, and we have partially built a modest structure. With this campaign we are seeking to send four community leaders to Jeremie, Haiti to the <a href=""http://universitynouvellegrandanse.org/agriculture"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">University of the Nouvelle Grande Anse </a>(UNOGA), where they will be trained by experienced agronomists on how to produce breadfruit flour. In addition, we are seeking the funds to transport equipment to rural Haiti, to complete the structure so we can have a locked storage space to keep our equipment safe, and to build a sturdy open air shelter that will serve as a production site. In the future we will be able to hold trainings, classes and workshops in the same space, including <a href=""http://advh.org/atelier-ansapit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atelier Ansapit</a>.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have just received an amazing and generous donation from </span><a href=""http://www.treesthatfeed.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Trees that Feed Foundation</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> of all the equipment necessary to start processing breadfruit and make it into cereal and/or flour which has an extended shelf life and can be used to make a variety of foods.

<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">Why This is Important</b><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<b>More than fifty percent of households in the village of Anse-a-Pitre are headed by single mothers.</b> With this in mind, ADVH seeks to create entrepreneurial opportunities that are safe, flexible, home and community-based and utilize the abundance of natural resources available. Breadfruit is one such example; there regularly is a surplus of this nutritious crop. </div>
<div>Because <b>an estimated 80% of food is imported</b> it is an urgent priority to create local food enterprises that provide single mothers with home-based economic opportunities. At present a large percentage of single mothers cross the border to the Dominican Republic to work as domestic servants and risk serious danger to themselves each time they make the crossing. <br/>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>Our budget grand total to complete construction, transport equipment from Brooklyn to Haiti, pay for travel to and training at the University of the Nouvelle Grande Anse, and cover miscellaneous equipment costs is as follows:<p></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Complete construction: the total cost for materials and labor is <b>$10,370.50</b>
</li>
<li>Transport equipment from Brooklyn, NY to Anse-a-Pitre, Haiti: the cost of this involves round trip travel for us (Colbert and Susannah) as we will need to accompany the equipment and spend at least a month in Anse-a-Pitre overseeing the construction project: <b>$1,420</b>
</li>
<li>Training at the University of the Nouvelle Grand Anse in Jeremie, Haiti: this covers the cost for four ADVH leaders to travel roundtrip to Jeremie and receive two days of training with experienced UNOGA agronomists: <b>$1,290</b>
</li>
<li>Purchase of miscellaneous equipment including food safety materials, bowls, buckets, knives, tables, storage equipment, spaghetti machine, tables and counters: <b>$1,083</b> </li>
</ol>
<b>GRAND TOTAL: $14,163.50</b><p></p>
<p>Please note, we are asking for $2,163.50 less than our actual budget requirements because this is our first experience with crowdfunding and we would like to avoid incurring extra fees associated with not reaching our funding goal. But we do actually need <b>$14,163.50</b> to complete this project and create a sustainable future for our organization.</p>
</div>
<div>
<b><br/></b><h3><b>What if We Don't Meet Our Goal</b></h3>
</div>
</div><div>Any amount of money will still help us towards achieving our goal. The first $1,400 raised will be used to transport the equipment to Anse-a-Pitre, Haiti. This in and of itself will be a big accomplishment, as it is very remote! The next $1,300 will be used to send ADVH leaders to a two-day training program in Jeremie, Haiti on the other side of the island. There they will learn how to use the equipment and to see the process of making breadfruit porridge and flour at Haiti's largest breadfruit processing site. Any money beyond this $2,700 will be used to finish our production site in Anse-a-Pitre. We are a resourceful group and we don't lose hope easily. We will work outdoors with a temporary (tarp) shelter until we have a completed site. Please note,however, that having a secure, stable building is very important because Haiti is very vulnerable and prone to natural disasters like hurricanes.</div><div><br/></div><h3>What If We Exceed Our Goal?!</h3><div>We will use additional funds to run plumbing to our building and install a water filtration system. Currently we have to carry water in buckets from the water source, about 50 meters away. Piped water onsite would greatly increase our functioning capacity. In addition we would like to purchase a drying rack that is being developed specifically for drying breadfruit shreds. The <a href=""http://fetzer.org/work/projects/breadfruit-haitian-recipe-self-reliance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mechanical engineering department at the University of St. Thomas</a> has been working hard on this and it will greatly reduce drying time. Above and beyond those goals we would like to start working on <a href=""http://advh.org/atelier-ansapit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Atelier Ansapit</a>. </div><div><br/></div><h3><b>Other Questions People Ask Us</b></h3><div><ul>
<li>
<b>You say you want to serve single mothers, so why are there not more single mothers represented in leadership roles in your organization? </b>The struggle of single mothers in Anse-a-Pitre who are head-of-households is complex. They do not have the time or resources to take an unpaid leadership position with a grassroots organization because they are occupied washing clothes by hand, cooking, carrying water, caring for children, all while trying earn enough money to feed their family. We realized that in order to get women involved in community organizing, we must offer them employment solutions, and food and water sources. We are seeking to do all these things with the proceeds from this campaign. </li>
<li>
<b>It isn't easy to change the way that people eat. How do you expect to introduce a new food and get people to include it in their diet?</b> We have an advantage in that breadfruit is not unknown. Many people enjoy eating it fried, roasted and boiled. Our partner organization, Trees That Feed Foundation has had great success introducing the breadfruit porridge to school children. It can be prepared either as a sweet or savory meal depending on how you season it. The school children have taken to the cereal quickly. Once this happens, they are sent home with a small bag and encouraged to ask their mothers to prepare it for them at home. It is in this way that other members of the family have been introduced to the cereal and it has been very successful. </li>
<li>
<b>Is my donation tax deductible? </b>At this time, no. We are, however, seeking nonprofit status in the United States.</li>

We have just received an amazing and generous donation from Trees that Feed Foundation of all the equipment necessary to start processing breadfruit and make it into cereal and/or flour which has an extended shelf life and can be used to make a variety of foods. Other projects in Haiti are experiencing great success feeding school children with breadfruit cereal. It is delicious and nutritious and locally sourced. 
Here is Colbert with the shredder and grinder:


This is the structure we have partially built on our land in Anse-a-Pitre:

Why This is Important


More than fifty percent of households in the village of Anse-a-Pitre are headed by single mothers. With this in mind, ADVH seeks to create entrepreneurial opportunities that are safe, flexible, home and community-based and utilize the abundance of natural resources available. Breadfruit is one such example; there regularly is a surplus of this nutritious crop. 
Because an estimated 80% of food is imported it is an urgent priority to create local food enterprises that provide single mothers with home-based economic opportunities. At present a large percentage of single mothers cross the border to the Dominican Republic to work as domestic servants and risk serious danger to themselves each time they make the crossing. 



What We NeedOur budget grand total to complete construction, transport equipment from Brooklyn to Haiti, pay for travel to and training at the University of the Nouvelle Grande Anse, and cover miscellaneous equipment costs is as follows:


Complete construction: the total cost for materials and labor is $10,370.50

Transport equipment from Brooklyn, NY to Anse-a-Pitre, Haiti: the cost of this involves round trip travel for us (Colbert and Susannah) as we will need to accompany the equipment and spend at least a month in Anse-a-Pitre overseeing the construction project: $1,420

Training at the University of the Nouvelle Grand Anse in Jeremie, Haiti: this covers the cost for four ADVH leaders to travel roundtrip to Jeremie and receive two days of training with experienced UNOGA agronomists: $1,290

Purchase of miscellaneous equipment including food safety materials, bowls, buckets, knives, tables, storage equipment, spaghetti machine, tables and counters: $1,083 

GRAND TOTAL: $14,163.50
Please note, we are asking for $2,163.50 less than our actual budget requirements because this is our first experience with crowdfunding and we would like to avoid incurring extra fees associated with not reaching our funding goal. But we do actually need $14,163.50 to complete this project and create a sustainable future for our organization.


What if We Don't Meet Our Goal

Any amount of money will still help us towards achieving our goal. The first $1,400 raised will be used to transport the equipment to Anse-a-Pitre, Haiti. This in and of itself will be a big accomplishment, as it is very remote! The next $1,300 will be used to send ADVH leaders to a two-day training program in Jeremie, Haiti on the other side of the island. There they will learn how to use the equipment and to see the process of making breadfruit porridge and flour at Haiti's largest breadfruit processing site. Any money beyond this $2,700 will be used to finish our production site in Anse-a-Pitre. We are a resourceful group and we don't lose hope easily. We will work outdoors with a temporary (tarp) shelter until we have a completed site. Please note,however, that having a secure, stable building is very important because Haiti is very vulnerable and prone to natural disasters like hurricanes.What If We Exceed Our Goal?!We will use additional funds to run plumbing to our building and install a water filtration system. Currently we have to carry water in buckets from the water source, about 50 meters away. Piped water onsite would greatly increase our functioning capacity. In addition we would like to purchase a drying rack that is being developed specifically for drying breadfruit shreds. The mechanical engineering department at the University of St. Thomas has been working hard on this and it will greatly reduce drying time. Above and beyond those goals we would like to start working on Atelier Ansapit. Other Questions People Ask Us

You say you want to serve single mothers, so why are there not more single mothers represented in leadership roles in your organization? The struggle of single mothers in Anse-a-Pitre who are head-of-households is complex. They do not have the time or resources to take an unpaid leadership position with a grassroots organization because they are occupied washing clothes by hand, cooking, carrying water, caring for children, all while trying earn enough money to feed their family. We realized that in order to get women involved in community organizing, we must offer them employment solutions, and food and water sources. We are seeking to do all these things with the proceeds from this campaign. 

It isn't easy to change the way that people eat. How do you expect to introduce a new food and get people to include it in their diet? We have an advantage in that breadfruit is not unknown. Many people enjoy eating it fried, roasted and boiled. Our partner organization, Trees That Feed Foundation has had great success introducing the breadfruit porridge to school children. It can be prepared either as a sweet or savory meal depending on how you season it. The school children have taken to the cereal quickly. Once this happens, they are sent home with a small bag and encouraged to ask their mothers to prepare it for them at home. It is in this way that other members of the family have been introduced to the cereal and it has been very successful. 

Is my donation tax deductible? At this time, no. We are, however, seeking nonprofit status in the United States.

<h3>My Story</h3> <p>Hey guys! I am starting this campaign because we have a serious problem. Have you ever seen a gaming tablet or laptop that doesn't cost at least $1000? I am trying to bring this concept into reality. Many Windows 8 tablets and laptops will cost around $400-900 just for something that can only be used to browse the internet and do light tasks. None of them can properly run games because they all lack a graphics processing chip. I want to bring a tablet to the market that has the mobility of a tablet and the power of a desktop, all without having to destroy your bank account. </p>

<p>For far too long, your alcoholic
beverage laws have served special interests, protecting private, rather than
public welfare, and it’s time we take a stand. We have taken legal action against our (otherwise) great state and are asking craft beer lovers, both near and far, for support in this cause. We are sorry that legal action is the only way to bring about fairness in
an antiquated system that has failed to adapt to the legal, social, and
commercial changes of the past 82 years.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441393431/em9cznfgdkmimfyaabt5.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>The injustice in question is the unfair and unconstitutional laws
that prohibit microbreweries from selling their products on-site for
off-premise consumption. You see, Texas allows every other alcoholic beverage manufacturer
to do just that – wineries, distilleries, and even brewpubs are allowed to sell
their products directly to the end consumer for off-premise consumption. Microbreweries cannot. </p><h2></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441393143/k7tpp0xz3its7o9duhal.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The <b>Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution</b> requires
that government treat
similarly situated persons the same, or precludes it from treating one set of
persons differently than others who are similarly situated. In other words,
beverage laws in Texas must treat all businesses similarly situated alike. How
are wineries, distilleries, or even brewpubs - making exactly the same products
as a microbrewery - any different? What state interest is being served? How is
this prohibition against microbreweries protecting the welfare, health, peace,
temperance, or safety of the people of Texas? Long story short, it isn’t. <br/><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441393058/elqxu1g7nvuulcqwlzjk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>This
prohibition against microbreweries is meant merely to protect private interests
and has no rational justification to the citizens of Texas. It is long past

promote the fair and equal treatment of its Members. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441394259/eghqjhtifbwlbvqa8mvo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>We hope we do! And, if so, we
plan to use those funds to further the efforts of craft brewers within the
state. The top seven contributing breweries will form a panel that will oversee
and vote on the deployment of any overages raised. These funds may go to the
Texas Craft Brewer’s Guild, Open the Taps, or perhaps used to
employ lobbyists to further the interests and growth of our state’s growing
beer community. There’s still plenty to be done, but we think this is a great
start. Hopefully, Operation Six-pack to Go will be a major success, and we can bring about some real
change.</p>

trend-setting Dallas brewery creates smooth and assertive craft beers worthy of
the area’s eclectic heritage. Since the company’s founding in 2011, Deep Ellum
Brewing Co. has crafted an award-winning roster of year-round, seasonal and
limited-release brews, including Deep Ellum IPA, Dallas Blonde, Double Brown
Stout, Four Swords Belgian Style Quad, Oak Cliff Coffee Ale, and this summer’s
newest addition — Easy Peasy IPA. To learn more about Deep Ellum Brewing

</div></div>","For far too long, your alcoholic
beverage laws have served special interests, protecting private, rather than
public welfare, and it’s time we take a stand. We have taken legal action against our (otherwise) great state and are asking craft beer lovers, both near and far, for support in this cause. We are sorry that legal action is the only way to bring about fairness in
an antiquated system that has failed to adapt to the legal, social, and
commercial changes of the past 82 years.
The injustice in question is the unfair and unconstitutional laws
that prohibit microbreweries from selling their products on-site for
off-premise consumption. You see, Texas allows every other alcoholic beverage manufacturer
to do just that – wineries, distilleries, and even brewpubs are allowed to sell
their products directly to the end consumer for off-premise consumption. Microbreweries cannot. 
The Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution requires
that government treat
similarly situated persons the same, or precludes it from treating one set of
persons differently than others who are similarly situated. In other words,
beverage laws in Texas must treat all businesses similarly situated alike. How
are wineries, distilleries, or even brewpubs - making exactly the same products
as a microbrewery - any different? What state interest is being served? How is
this prohibition against microbreweries protecting the welfare, health, peace,
temperance, or safety of the people of Texas? Long story short, it isn’t. 

This
prohibition against microbreweries is meant merely to protect private interests
and has no rational justification to the citizens of Texas. It is long past
time for Texas to start making significant changes to its Beverage Code that
promote the fair and equal treatment of its Members. 
Oh, we've tried. Over the past 7 legislative sessions (14 years), bills have been introduced that would allow some level of beer to be sold for off-premise consumption. Unfortunately, all dreams of such laws passing are usually quickly crushed by the powerful distributor lobbyists. This whole lawsuit thing was tried once before as well; however, it never moved past a summary judgement. With your help, we plan to take this case the distance and see it succeed. “The
essential definition of corruption in a representative democracy is the
usurpation of public authority to the advancement of private interests. The
system currently used to regulate alcoholic beverages in Texas now promotes
private, rather than public, welfare.“
Now,
before you go getting all crazy that we just called the entire Commission
corrupt,  this quote was taken directly
from a position paper submitted in 2006 as part of the Texas Sunset Commission,
which is tasked with making regular assessments of the continuing need for each
state agency to exist. Unfortunately, this Position Paper was not formally
considered or adopted by the Sunset Commission. Had that been the case, maybe
all of this could have been avoided. 
(Read the full position paper, here.)
But here
we are. Not only are we, as microbreweries, being unjustly prohibited from
selling six-packs to go, but consumers – the citizens of Texas and beyond – are
being unjustly prohibited from directly supporting their favorite Texas brewery.  

Join us in Operation Six-Pack to Go and Help us #SueTABC to abolish the
unconstitutional laws that unfairly discriminate against our growing number of
microbreweries!
As
you’re already aware, we have taken the first step by filing the lawsuit,
but there is still a very long ways to go. We have retained two law firms and several
expert witnesses, including the former general Counsel for TABC. Lawsuits are expensive, but with your support, we can see this across the finish line! Not only will your contribution help the cause, but it will also send a strong message to our lawmakers that we want continued progression in our craft beer laws!  
We believe that being part of history and helping further craft beer in Texas is a reward in itself, but we're also tossing in some cool perks for your help! 
We hope we do! And, if so, we
plan to use those funds to further the efforts of craft brewers within the
state. The top seven contributing breweries will form a panel that will oversee
and vote on the deployment of any overages raised. These funds may go to the
Texas Craft Brewer’s Guild, Open the Taps, or perhaps used to
employ lobbyists to further the interests and growth of our state’s growing
beer community. There’s still plenty to be done, but we think this is a great
start. Hopefully, Operation Six-pack to Go will be a major success, and we can bring about some real
change.

amongst the 116 families living in the riverbanks. The houses are almost complete
and we are in the transition to shift the families to their own homes. One
house consists of one bedroom and a kitchen. They will have communal toilets

connected. However, the natural resource of water we had planned to bring in
the houses has dried up significantly and we are scared that it will not be

<h4>Background &amp; History</h4>
<h4>
</h4>
<h3></h3>
<p>In August of 2007, cofounders Tim &amp; Tammy
Bogeman picked up their son, Tom, whom has a cognitive disability, from a
special needs summer camp in Crivitz, Wisconsin.<span>  The camp has a limited number of spaces each
summer and is very hard to get into.  Knowing
and understanding the lack of resources in Northern Wisconsin, especially in the
tri-county area of Vilas, Oneida and Forest Counties, they started
brainstorming.  They first thought of
starting a camp in their own community that would provide recreation for people
with special needs.  Then in 2009, when their
son, Tom graduated from high school, they had to look within their own
community for job opportunities for him. 
Where was Tom to work; he needs one on one supervision? Where was he to be productive and feel like he
was a contributing, viable citizen? The need
of starting a farming community that would provide supportive life skills experience
for people with physical and developmental disabilities became very clear.  When looking into the future for their son,
Tom, it seemed so uncertain.  Their
desire for him is to be successful and to enjoy his life, enriched with
opportunities that would support him now and in the future. </span></p>
<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Chick A Dee Acres Farm, Inc. (CDAF) is a farming
community that provides supportive life skills for individuals with
physical and developmental disabilities.<span> 
This program will offer a daily multi-faceted program to include
supported life skills and recreation.  Within the life skills program, CDAF
will strive to instill healthy life style habits through exercise, education
and proper nutrition.  In order to best
meet the needs to our clients, we will conduct a strength and weakness
evaluation and observations.  Results
will determine goals, accommodations, modifications and levels of support to
increase success, independence and maximize work potential. Life skills experience will include organic
gardening, woodworking, car detailing, maple syrup collecting/processing and
wreath making among others.  Midday, the individuals
will have the opportunity to enjoy recreational activities including but not
limited to: archery, fishing, swimming, bowling, movies, snowshoeing and craft
projects.  Products produced on the farm will
be packaged, marketed and sold through a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)
program and at community-based flea/farmers markets.  Working together within their community, CDAF
clients will have natural opportunities to increase their communication and
functional math and reading skills.  The
ultimate goal for the CDAF community is that clients have an array of
opportunities that will contribute to a sense of fulfillment, joy, success and
purpose.</span></p>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>CDAF
will be certifying the farm house as a 3 to 4 bed group home.<span>  I addition, within the first 5 years we plan
on building more 3 to 4 bed certified group homes on the property.</span><br/><span></span></p>
<h3>Mission Statement

</h3>
<p>The mission of Chick a Dee Acres
Farm is to provide a supportive community for individuals with physical
and developmental disabilities, where enjoyable recreation and lifelong
learning are fostered, both on the farm and in the local community.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div> <p>We are shooting for $175,000.00 <br/></p>
<p>We are in need of $125,000.00 towards down payment and closing costs to purchase farm property.</p>
<p>We are in need of an additional $50,000.00 for a tractor with implements and garden seed.</p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal of $175,000.00, we will put any funds we receive into savings towards our farm project and continue with the fund raising until such time that we have the funds needed to purchase the farm.  <br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div> <p>
</p>
<p> <span></span>After personally working with children and adults with physical and developmental disabilities for the past five years, we have found that there is a lack of supportive opportunities within our tri-county area of Northern Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Within
the physically and developmental disabled population, we have found that there is such a broad range
of abilities. Each person within the
disabled community has unique needs and it is hard to find supported equal
opportunities in our local community for them. 
The farm program will provide a wide variety of life skills essentially.<br/></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>As
with all endeavors there are certain risks.<span> 
For CDAF, these could potentially include: </span></p>

Natural disaster, inclement weather could cause
a less profitable season, possible injury or harm to a client or supportive staff.<br/><br/><p>
</p>
<p>A Communicable
virus that would cause a decreased number of clients and support staff.</p>
<p>Here at CDAF, we feel that our most important challenge will be to evaluate each  client, determining what segment of the program would best support their abilities.  The ultimate goal for the CDAF community is that clients have an array of opportunities that will contribute to a sense of fulfillment, joy, success and purpose.  <br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div> <p>We ask that you spread the word about our project to all of your friends and family.  This is such an important program not only for us but mostly to the special needs community in our area.</p>
<p>Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools</p>
<p>Thank You to all for the great support!!!<br/></p>

tri-county area of Vilas, Oneida and Forest Counties, they started
brainstorming.  They first thought of
starting a camp in their own community that would provide recreation for people
with special needs.  Then in 2009, when their
son, Tom graduated from high school, they had to look within their own
community for job opportunities for him. 
Where was Tom to work; he needs one on one supervision? Where was he to be productive and feel like he
was a contributing, viable citizen? The need
of starting a farming community that would provide supportive life skills experience
for people with physical and developmental disabilities became very clear.  When looking into the future for their son,
Tom, it seemed so uncertain.  Their
desire for him is to be successful and to enjoy his life, enriched with
opportunities that would support him now and in the future. 
Short Summary Chick A Dee Acres Farm, Inc. (CDAF) is a farming
community that provides supportive life skills for individuals with
physical and developmental disabilities. 
This program will offer a daily multi-faceted program to include
supported life skills and recreation.  Within the life skills program, CDAF
will strive to instill healthy life style habits through exercise, education
and proper nutrition.  In order to best
meet the needs to our clients, we will conduct a strength and weakness
evaluation and observations.  Results
will determine goals, accommodations, modifications and levels of support to
increase success, independence and maximize work potential. Life skills experience will include organic
gardening, woodworking, car detailing, maple syrup collecting/processing and
wreath making among others.  Midday, the individuals
will have the opportunity to enjoy recreational activities including but not
limited to: archery, fishing, swimming, bowling, movies, snowshoeing and craft
projects.  Products produced on the farm will
be packaged, marketed and sold through a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)
program and at community-based flea/farmers markets.  Working together within their community, CDAF
clients will have natural opportunities to increase their communication and
functional math and reading skills.  The
ultimate goal for the CDAF community is that clients have an array of
opportunities that will contribute to a sense of fulfillment, joy, success and
purpose.


CDAF
will be certifying the farm house as a 3 to 4 bed group home.  I addition, within the first 5 years we plan
on building more 3 to 4 bed certified group homes on the property.
Mission Statement


The mission of Chick a Dee Acres
Farm is to provide a supportive community for individuals with physical
and developmental disabilities, where enjoyable recreation and lifelong
learning are fostered, both on the farm and in the local community.

What We Need & What You Get
 We are shooting for $175,000.00 
We are in need of $125,000.00 towards down payment and closing costs to purchase farm property.
We are in need of an additional $50,000.00 for a tractor with implements and garden seed.
If we are unable to reach our goal of $175,000.00, we will put any funds we receive into savings towards our farm project and continue with the fund raising until such time that we have the funds needed to purchase the farm.  
The Impact
 

 After personally working with children and adults with physical and developmental disabilities for the past five years, we have found that there is a lack of supportive opportunities within our tri-county area of Northern Wisconsin.
Within
the physically and developmental disabled population, we have found that there is such a broad range
of abilities. Each person within the
disabled community has unique needs and it is hard to find supported equal
opportunities in our local community for them. 
The farm program will provide a wide variety of life skills essentially.
Risks & Challenges

As
with all endeavors there are certain risks. 
For CDAF, these could potentially include: 

Natural disaster, inclement weather could cause
a less profitable season, possible injury or harm to a client or supportive staff.

A Communicable
virus that would cause a decreased number of clients and support staff.
Here at CDAF, we feel that our most important challenge will be to evaluate each  client, determining what segment of the program would best support their abilities.  The ultimate goal for the CDAF community is that clients have an array of opportunities that will contribute to a sense of fulfillment, joy, success and purpose.  
Other Ways You Can Help
 We ask that you spread the word about our project to all of your friends and family.  This is such an important program not only for us but mostly to the special needs community in our area.

<h4><b>Our Story</b></h4>
<p>We are climbers who have been living in Phnom Penh for five years (and counting). We are enthusiasts and fervently passionate about this sport because it builds community, a safe and supportive environment, trust, self-esteem, confidence and perseverance. </p>
<p>Since we have arrived, we have been organizing outdoor climbing trips. These trips are well attended by Cambodians and expats alike. Often, they are limited to once a month since the closest climbing site is 1.5 hours away. Transportation, travel costs and distance also exclude many interested climbers from participating and climbing more frequently. We are building this climbing gym so climbing can be more accessible to anyone who is interested. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

How will Phnom Climb make Phnom Penh a better place?

Phnom Climb’s social mission is an essential component of

Play and how play can be used to encourage behavior change and positive
attitudes. 
Phnom Climb sees rock climbing as a development solution in
the following way:



Foster self-esteem and confidence in
disadvantaged youth, children and girls


Help children and youth overcome trauma

Enable young people to build positive life skills and behaviors 
Strengthen trust between young people of different economic classes and backgrounds

Promote physical and psychosocial health

Practice problem solving skills, goals setting, decision making, stress management and effective communication

We are developing partnerships with organizations working
with disadvantaged young people and street children. By offering discounted or free climbing sessions and workshops, we can use climbing to teach young people to build trust, perseverance, teamwork, and communication

In additional, Phnom Climb aims to partner with the Siem Reap-based climbing

Ronin was born 2lbs 15 3/4oz and spent 2 and a half months in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. He has Down's Syndrome and some other health issues. My wife had to quit working to stay home and care for him due to daycare costing $400 dollars a week. We started his disability, but due to making a huge amount of money (just joking) as a firefighter we get $290 a month for 10 months of the year. Needless to say times are tight. We need your assistance in starting a family owned and operated firearms company. I have been working on guns all my life and recently restored a few antique arms and completed other work for police officers, hunters, etc. All have said I need to be in business. So we want to start a business in Ronin's name. A place where he will be able to work when he gets older and have people around him that love and care about him. A business that, as we grow, wants employees with special needs kids, where we will have a daycare on site, that our employees can bring their child to work with them and go and see them anytime they are working. A company that looks forward to hiring Veterans and disabled veterans, these are my brothers and sisters and we will not turn our backs on them. This is about making sure Ronin and other families have a bright furture, making sure that, after I am gone, there is something to provide for him.  We want to provide American jobs, a high quality product, and help the community. I was finally able to save enough money to purchase our LLC and domain names hopefully I can get the websites up soon. I assure you, your donation will not go to waste.</p> </div> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p><div> <p>We are trying to raise a minimum of $100,000 dollars, we actually need more than that.

$200 dollars gets you: The shirt, hat and your choice of a tactical pistol or tactical rifle class taught by the Draco and Ardent Groups. These are Ex US and Isreali Military instructors and they offer an extremely good class for shooters of all levels. Really top notch training ($500 value).

<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3> <p> We understand that the gun market is a crowded one. Our model is simple: Build the absolute best firearm for the money and make it unique to each customer. You will pick everything you want on the firearm: buttstock, frame, receiver type, barrel length and type, flash hider, foregrip, pistol grip, sights, optics, custom Cerakote colors (every firearm), caliber, accessories, etc. Your firearm will come with trigger work already done, polished feed ramps, and our top secret process, basically anything you will send out to a gunsmith after you have spent money on an expensive gun to make it better. Our firearms will come that way out of the box. If I would not be proud to own it, IT WILL NOT LEAVE THE SHOP. We will be making fully custom 1911's, AR's, Holsters,  gunsmithing services and eventually suppressors.</p>
<p>We will offer limited lifetime warranty, normal wear and tear is not covered, basically as long as you didn't do something to cause a malfunction, catastrophic failure, or lets face just plain dumb, and it is a proven manufacturing defect, your weapon will be replaced. The warranty will be able to be transferred to immediate family members in the event of death in family or just passed down (this will require documentation). If someone buys the firearm, they will be able to transfer the warranty for a fee after providing documentation from FFL dealer. Our goal is to make firearms that will become heirlooms for generations, from the everyday American to the most discerning firearms aficionado<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">. </span></p>

USA, and Canada has being met with excitement and approval. There is a 
strong desire from the local women, village elders, and religious 
leaders to be involved in the project. A local veterinarian has confirmed that the Women Eggpreneur model is a suitable solution for 
women in Machakos. The founder, Matthew Dickson, has been encouraged by the response. 
 He has opened an office in Machakos County, and his team is currently 
building a chicken house to raise the first batch of egg-layers, which 
will be ready this summer for trained mothers to receive. On the 
business front, he has contacted local egg buyers to understand their 
egg production demands and secure contracts. Pieces are coming together, and we invite you to join us too!<br/></p>Please fight with us against poverty and malnutrition in Machakos, Kenya.<br/><p><a href=""http://www.taponainternational.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.taponainternational.com</a></p><h2><b>PARTNERING ARTISTS</b></h2><p><br/></p><h1><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1299658/files/20150316124859-robgunnbunfroblue.jpg?1426535339"" src="""" style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"",Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; width: 620.465px; height: 263px; background-color: initial;'/></h1><p><b>CALVIN ARSENIA<br/></b><a href=""http://www.calvinarsenia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">http://www.calvinarsenia.com</a></p><div>Calvin Arsenia uses music to tell stories of the heart.

 Eggpreneur is an egg farming social venture started to financially 
empower mothers with children five years old and younger in rural Kenya. Our goal of $17,000 will fund all necessary start-up and infrastructure to launch Eggpreneurship for 20 women and their children. All funds go toward the project on the ground to fight poverty, unemployment, and child malnutrition.WHERE IS THE PROJECT TODAY?A year of networking with people in Kenya, the 
USA, and Canada has being met with excitement and approval. There is a 
strong desire from the local women, village elders, and religious 
leaders to be involved in the project. A local veterinarian has confirmed that the Women Eggpreneur model is a suitable solution for 
women in Machakos. The founder, Matthew Dickson, has been encouraged by the response. 
 He has opened an office in Machakos County, and his team is currently 
building a chicken house to raise the first batch of egg-layers, which 
will be ready this summer for trained mothers to receive. On the 
business front, he has contacted local egg buyers to understand their 
egg production demands and secure contracts. Pieces are coming together, and we invite you to join us too!Please fight with us against poverty and malnutrition in Machakos, Kenya.http://www.taponainternational.comPARTNERING ARTISTSCALVIN ARSENIAhttp://www.calvinarsenia.comCalvin Arsenia uses music to tell stories of the heart.

Labs for Liberty is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that provides service dogs & mountain retreats for Veterans of the United States Military, free of charge.
This organization runs as the product of a fire, a flamethat burns inside of each of us that is associated with its cause. The burning desire and call to action to save those who have fought protecting our freedoms. Just as they have fought, cried, bled, suffered, smiled, laughed, and persevered as will we while on this road to end the 22 Veteran suicides per day. We will mirror the philosophy of the US Navy Seals in that ""WE will NEVER quit, WE will persevere and thrive on adversity. If knocked down. WE will get back up. WE will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect our Veterans and accomplish our mission. WE are NEVER out of the fight."" Together we stand undivided, and unbeatable. - Jacob Nold, Labs for Liberty Director of PhilanthropyHere's the story-Everyday 22 Veterans commit suicide, that's 1 every 65 minutes, and 8,030 per year! That's more than the War on Terror since 2001 which has claimed 6,717 American lives.

Risks &
Challenges
The need for well-trained
service dogs is great. The greatest challenge we face is financing, as everyone
that works for us is strictly a volunteer. There is no lack of individuals,
actually Veterans, who themselves are willing to learn to train service dogs
for other veterans. There is no lack of puppies, as we work closely with a
reputable breeder and will be breeding labs ourselves. And, most unfortunately,
there is no lack of individuals in desperate need of a well-trained service dog
to help them reintegrate into and function in civilian life.
We are committed
to giving our time, and whatever funds we can, to support our mission. Serving
our veterans is our privilege and our passion. We hope to share that privilege
and passion with other Americans.
 

Our Team:



Make our mission YOUR mission and share what we are doing with everyone you know! Together we can save lives!

<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p><b>Creating
a Profound Sense of Community</b> is a movement rising up in the wake of
recent tragedies inFerguson MO, Madison WI, Los Angeles CA, North
Charleston SC--and now Baltimore, MD. We have initiated this project to: </p>
<p>·Dismantle
the barriers between law enforcement and the communities they serve that have
contributed to the use of excessive force and violence in our communities</p>
<p>·Create
partnerships in our communities, and with law enforcement to generate trust,
respect and honor to work together powerfully toward viable and acceptable
solutions</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise $75,000 for Town Hall
meetings and the Public Education Campaign.</p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p><b><i>Who we are:</i></b> We are Omar Henderson and Kareem Ali,
longtime residents of metropolitan Washington DC and partners in a media
company. We are parents and grandparents, and our deepest aspiration is that
our children—and all of the children in our communities—are safe and grow up to
become adults with productive and meaningful lives. We were profoundly
frustrated with the news of the Grand Jury’s failure to bring forward an
indictment of the police officer who shot and killed unarmed Michael Brown in
Ferguson, MO. Yet out of this sense of helplessness, we committed to do
something about this. We could no longer sit on the sidelines and complain and
we started Creating a Profound Sense of Community.<br/>
<br/>
<b><i><span>Why this project:</span></i></b> We are all too familiar with the abuse, injury,
sense of victimization, even death from the use of excessive force in
encounters with police. At the same time, police officers we know say how
dangerous it is patrolling the streets in high crime areas. In Baltimore, more
than seven police officers were injured in the riots following the funeral of
latest police violence victim, Freddie Gray. <b>The relationship between law
enforcement and the African Americans is laden with fear. </b>The media
coverage exploits that emotion and sensationalizes the situation, leaving us
with a “well, what can we really do?”<br/>
<br/>
<b><i>What We Believe</i></b>: Many policy suggestions are flying around, from
heightened accountability of law enforcement agencies, revision of regulations
governing police conduct, expanding the use of bodycams, and more. While all
these proposals hit at much needed reform, how do we move forward, in this
climate of mistrust, anger, and sorrow on a massive community level? We hear of
marches being organized to protest police violence and, while we truly want our
voices to be heard, the ensuing rioting overshadows our voices. What happens
after the destruction from the rioting? How are we going to forge a lasting
capacity to bring peace to our streets?</p>
<p>We firmly believe that partnership
between law enforcement and our communities is a necessity. Perhaps together we
can build trust, get to know one another on a deeper level and work together
powerfully to keep our streets safe. A climate of cooperation can help lay the
foundation on which new policies and regulations governing police conduct can
be built. AND we have to look at ourselves! <b><i>Who are we that this
goes on in our communities?</i></b> <b><i>All of us need to take ownership
of our collective future.</i></b> Creating a Profound Sense of Community
is an expression of our concern and compassion for people here and around
the world. </p>
<p>When we can see one another as human
beings with fundamentally the same interests, we can work together instead of
resorting to violence out of fear and anger. Relationships can be transformed
and paradigm shifts will occur inside of new possibilities for collaboration. </p>
<p><b><i>Building a Team:</i></b>  We reached out to an international expert on conflict
resolution (featured in the national best-selling book,<i> The Three Laws of Performance</i> by Steve Zaffron) who is a
well-known leader in communication training and personal development, Ms. Jean
Lloyd. In 25 years as a change maker she has touched over 250,000 lives through
her work with corporations, non-profit organizations and individuals. She
calls herself a cultural architect instigating change and leading difficult
conversations that create cultures where everyone wins.</p>
<p>Upon receiving our invitation to
serve, Ms. Jean Lloyd enthusiastically accepted our request to facilitate the
town hall meetings. “No one has asked for my help to take on anything of this
magnitude and importance. I had to accept.” (For a fuller bio on Ms. Lloyd go
to <span><a href=""http://jeanlloyd.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://jeanlloyd.com</a>)</span></p>
<p>Subsequently we reached out to known
experts, professionals, and community leaders and formed teams around video and
broadcast production, strategic planning, finance, fundraising and non-profit
management, marketing and promotion.<br/>
</p><p><b><span>The Project</span></b></p>
<p><b><i>The core activities</i></b><b>:</b> Creating a Profound Sense of
Community (CAPSOC) will host four “town hall’ style meetings to bring community
and law enforcement together.  CAPSOC meetings will broadcast, live, the
guided conversations facilitated by Jean Lloyd. The project provides a safe
space where participants on both sides of this conflict engage in a process
that can alter the language and mindset of conflict to one of cooperation. Seeming adversaries will begin to understand
one another on much deeper levels, creating partnership where none existed. The
next Town Hall Meeting is scheduled for Monday, May 18 at 7 pm in Baltimore,
MD. Please visit <a href=""http://www.capsoc.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.capsoc.info</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>Supplementing these Town Hall
Meetings is our Public Education Campaign to spread the word and enlist others
to get involved. We will sign up community groups, businesses, and leaders as
members, sponsors, and key supporters to generate momentum to achieve the goals
of the partnership. Our educational resources under development include a
documentary about the work, PSAs, and other media promoting the work of CAPSOC.</p>
<p><b><i>Expected Results: </i></b>A critical mass of committed individuals, community groups,
religious institutions, and businesses, who generate the partnership with law
enforcement sets the foundation to work together powerfully, forging an action
agenda that will manifest in strategies governing police conduct. Concomitantly,
as this partnership works to eliminate the violence perpetrated by law
enforcement, perhaps the community can come to a higher truth that resolves to
reduce the violence we perpetrate on ourselves. The possibilities are limitless
for new conversations leading to taking on other community challenges, such as
improving schools, creating more programs for our youth, supporting our
seniors. Anything is possible in communication!</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><b><i>What We Need:</i></b>Our aim is to
raise $75,000 in the next 90 days, which represents 42% of our annual budget
($180,000). In the next 30 days we expect to raise the first $25,000. With this
we can cover expenses for the second and third Town Hall Meetings and launch
our Public Education Campaign. The first Town Hall meeting was completed thanks
to the in-kind contributions of many individuals who have joined this effort
and gave their blood, sweat and tears for strategic planning, marketing,
production, broadcast, outreach, fundraising and facilitation expenses. The
budget breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p><b>Town Hall Meetings </b>(facilitation, technical/production team, facilities,
equipment) <br/></p>
<p>$45,000</p>
<p><b>Public Education and Ambassadors

<p>$20,000</p>
<p><b>Fundraising Expenses</b> (events, materials, mailing, perks) </p>
<p>$7,500</p>
<p><b>Administrative Expenses  
         </b></p>
<p>$2,500</p>
<p><b>Total= $75,000 </b></p>
<p><b><i>What You Get:</i></b>In return for
your contributions, we have many perks for you to enjoy Please look at the list
of perks in that section. </p>
<p><b>What happens if we have a money
shortfall: </b>Your contribution makes it possible
for us to promote and produce the Town Hall meetings, engaging both law
enforcement and communities who feel besieged by wanton violence; your support
makes it possible to reach out to people across the DC region, as well as
across the country. The only thing that may need adjustment is the timeframe of
our events, if we don’t meet our fundraising benchmarks. However, we envision
tremendous growth in numbers joining this initiative. Our fundraising will
increase as the number of sponsors, friends, and members swell.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The potential impact of CAPSOC can
be far reaching. The first Town Hall meeting had participants reflecting on
their own participation in community building and committing to the work of
CAPSOC with others. Together we can find solutions that calls all of us to
become responsible for the condition of our communities, and commit to building
a shared vision that includes law enforcement.</p>
<p>The road to this transformation
happens because we are creating a new model of communication which allows us to
look at each other anew, especially those whom we viewed as our adversaries.
The impact of the mass movement we are launching is significant progress
forward toward reconciliation, compassion, and cooperation for a future in
which we can all thrive.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The biggest challenge is being able
to reach a critical mass and a level of momentum that will make a difference.
We started as two friends who said “we need to DO SOMETHING!” Now we’re fifty.
Every day more individuals are coming forward, joining our efforts for peace on
the streets. With your help our ranks will reach thousands. The goal is much
bigger than any of our personal concerns; we are committed to success. Our
lives and the lives of our children depend on this.</p>

We're a small mom and pop business looking to expand. We are both college graduates and have 4 kids all under the age of 7. Despite our busy days and both having full time jobs; starting a business has always been our dream. Our kids love snow cones and it's pretty hard to deny the smiles when they have them; ultimately we decided to make it a business. As an educator of 11-years (Tynesha) I want to give back to students, their parents, and our community, We want to create jobs and create smiles day to day! We currently have a trailer that travels throughout Houston and surrounding areas. We're planning to open a permanent location for the summer. We need funds to help furnish the building, equipment, and hire full-time employees. (We hire single moms, Veterans, and teens looking for work, anyone who needs a break and looking for work)We are hoping to raise $30,000 of the start-up cost to make the extension of our business dream a reality.

My target market is the young at heart Entrepreneur who wants to get her/his business going but isn't sure how and doesn't have a lot of money to get professional advice. Consulting services in the areas of science, business and law can go for up to $1000.00 an hour, a price no new Entrepreneur can really afford. My service will provide consulting for a quarter of that price, and on a sliding scale if needed. Why do I do it? Because I love to develop new ideas and by working with these young inventors and business people I get to develop more ideas than I could have in a lifetime!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I am hoping to raise $30,000.00 for two specific purposes. First, I want to have a launch event which will allow me to get the word out to young Entrepreneurs (not just the investor crowd etc) about a place they can go to get help starting their businesses. This event would be held in Boston, MA on New Year's Eve, welcoming in 2016 at one of the local hotel venues or perhaps a historical site. The event would be both a way to introduce Entrepreneurs to Creative Innovation Consulting but I will also bring in a number of industry leaders so the event will also serve as a networking platform for the Entrepreneurs. The event is slated to cost about $24,,000 which will cover the cost of the venue, the food, the speaker fees and help underwrite a small number of hotel rooms for young Entrepreneurs that would not otherwise be able to attend. </p>
<p>The rest of the money would be used to expand my social and market presence to make more Entrepreneurs aware of this lost cost option to help get them started. Money would be spent on developing an interactive IT platform so that I can work with Entrepreneurs that are not located in the Boston, Massachusetts area.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I have my PhD in Neuroscience from Albert Einstein College of Medicine. My first faculty position was at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. I was recruited to Harvard Medical School in 2008 and spent many years running my own laboratory focusing on cardiovascular disease. I then left Harvard and went back to school to get my Juris Doctor. My specialty is Intellectual Property and I have worked for the past years with Entrepreneurs, helping them get started and helping them protect their intellectual property. I presently work with MassBio helping advise young inventors with development of their projects. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What I have found is that most young companies get in to trouble with contracts and intellectual property issues early because as they start up they cannot afford to hire Attorneys or Business Consultants. They try to do it all on their own, usually with unfortunate results. I work with clients who find themselves embroiled in lawsuits based on issues they did not get help with early and now they are paying the price. Some of these companies have truly amazing technology that is lost to the public when the company goes under due to poor strategy or legal protection. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I want to end this problem by making a place for these Entrepreneurs to come to for help. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>It is always risky to start a new business, and Entrepreneurs know this! One risk here is that even with the lower charges than a standard consulting firm a really young company, say one person with a great idea, would still not be able to afford the service. I plan to mitigate this risk by affiliating with a local pro bono Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship clinic where I could send clients for help if they cannot afford my services. I also plan to offer a sliding scale fee system to help Entrepreneurs afford the help they need. </p>
<p>Another challenge is that while I have a lot of experience, I do not know everything! There will be things that people need that I am not able to help with. To mitigate this problem I have developed relationships with individuals in other related fields that I can go to for help, or can send clients to if the situation is too complex. </p>
<p>There will always be a few challenges but I know I can rise to them and really solve the problem of affordable advice. </p>

Anita Wills is a Community Activist, whose 19 year old grandson was killed in January of 2011. She is also on the Advisory Council for the Essie Justice Group.  Dionne Smith-Downs is a Community Activist in Stockton California and throughout the Bay Area.  She and her family suffered the loss of their 16 year old son in 2010.  </p>
<p>There is an epidemic of violence in our community resulting in families devastated and left to grieve alone. The Inter Council for Mothers of Murdered Children offers assistance to families through Peer Counseling, Referrals, and other support service.

</p><p>That I will make a living doing what I love. I love cooking!
It’s my passion.</p>
<p>But…starting a new business requires lots of funds. </p>
<p>In order to have a loan for the purchase of the Tabersnack food truck,
any financial institution is asking that I have a $10 000 cash deposit. This is
where I need your help with this fundraiser.</p>
<p>Below you will find the details of some of the different
costs I will incur to start my journey. I am sure there will be more, but for
now, here are the ones I know as a fact!</p>
<p><b>Cost Details</b></p>
<p>Cost of the food truck: $81 000</p>
<p>Re-zoning Fees: $867 (minimum)</p>
<p>Kitchen Equipment: $5 000</p>
<p>Marketing - website, logo, card, rack cards, etc.: $4 000 (I know, it's small but I have to start
somewhere).</p><p>Point of sale and electronics: $1 000<br/></p>
<p>Indiegogo Fees: Indiegogo charges a 4% fee if I reach my goal. On top of that, they are charging 3.5% to cover the Paypal fees. If I don’t reach the goal they take 9%... but
let's not go there, right?</p>
<p>One more important thing about this fundraiser... Whatever
the amount I am able to raise, <b>I am
making a promise to myself that I WILL HAVE that food truck, no matter what!</b></p>
<p><b>A Little Bit About Me</b></p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, cooking has been a real
passion for me. The love and passion for food 
is running through my blood! After thinking about it a little bit, I
understand why it is in my genes! Both of my grandfathers were cooks and earned
their living this way. For a few years, my mom was the chef in a pizzeria our
family owned. Two of her brothers were chefs their entire lives. Again, the
same thing on my dad’s side. Three of his siblings were professional cooks and
two of my cousins work as chefs. All of them are self-taught cooks. Well I
guess this is why my desire to cook is so strong. It is in me!</p>
<p>As many of you may know, I am French Canadian. I moved from
Quebec city in 1998 to go to the big city, Montreal. From there, I moved to the
Cayman Islands in 2009 and one year later, I moved to Prince Edward County!
Yup, I left the Caribbean to come to the beautiful county; a small peninsula on the  Lake Ontario. One of the best
decisions I have ever made! Now, 4 years later, I thought that the County could
benefit from a little blend of Quebec, Montreal, Caribbean and county food
flair!</p>
<p>I have been working in sales for 19 years and have worked in
an office environment for all my adult life. I love helping people so it was
good, but it’s far from being in a kitchen, where I really want to be! I have
never been a big recipe follower. I just go with my instinct, and not too often
has my instinct failed me. I love smelling ingredients. Just by the smell, I
will know what works with what. For me it’s easy. Just like it is easy for some
artists to take a paint brush and start painting.</p>
<p>This past October, I participated in my first ""cook
off"" at the Wellington Farmer's market, in Prince Edward County. I thought
to myself, why not give it a try and participate. To my astonishment, <b>I won the first prize!</b> This was a
revelation to me. On that same day, just for fun, I brought with me some sweet
pickled beets and sweet and spicy pickled onions to sell. I was surprised by people’s
reaction. They loved them and were saying they tasted like beets they tried in
Quebec!! This is where I got the idea of a food truck.<br/></p>
<p><b>Location! Location! Location!<br/></b></p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to be able to have my own food truck on
my property but also be able to move around and get to festivals and events. In
summer and winter I would like to stay stationary on North Beach road (where I
reside).  Many people use this road to go
to the beach and to get to some local campgrounds. Also, in my area, I am
surrounded by wineries, farms, and beautiful tourist destinations. For spring
and fall, I would be “on the go” to different fairs, festivals and trade shows
in the area. With so many things happening in the county for spring and fall,
you won’t want to miss it!<br/></p>
<p>Prince Edward County is located 1 hour south-west of Kingston, 4
hours west from Montreal or Ottawa or 2 hours east from Toronto. The County,
like the locals are calling it, is well known for its agro-tourism, its white
sand beaches (Sandbanks Provincial Park, Presqu’Ile Provincial Park and North
Beach Provincial Park) and the diversity of artists. It is still small enough
to call it country but big enough to have a great time. </p>
<p>Why do I want to be open during winter? Well… anybody who knows
the area knows that it’s hard to find a place to eat lunch during the low
tourist season.  Because I care about the
well being of the locals, this is the reason why I want to be open on weekdays
for lunch during the cold season. There won't be any need to drive at least 20
minutes to find food in Hillier! Weekly menu and specials will be posted on
Facebook and Twitter! On request, catering will also be available.<br/></p>
<p><b>The Food!</b></p>
<p>I have so many ideas that I am having a hard time setting a
fixed menu! So it will change from time to time to be able to offer different
types of food!</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, I want to “rock your socks off” with my
jerk chicken and jerk tofu! Yup! You read it right, tofu! I have to have
something for everybody, right? Of course, I will have poutine. How I could not
have poutine if I am coming from Quebec city? I want your mouth to squeak while
eating it!</p>
<p>Otherwise, here are some examples of what I would like to
cook for you in the summer. I am always open to suggestions! </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Burgers</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Blooming onions (small and colossal family size)
and onion rings</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Guedille (kind of a lobster roll but with
chicken or egg salad</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Cipaille or tourtière (meat pie but with cubed
meat)</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Panini</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Maple anything! Like Maple pie, “Pouding
chômeur”, salad dressing, maple glazed pork, maple ham, etc!</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Homemade potato chips and French fries</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Vegetarian and Vegan options</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Sweet treats (cookies, vegan bars, cakes,
puddings, etc.)</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>And much more!</p>
<p>The menu will be slightly different during the “cold” season
as I want to make sure to warm you up to the bone. For sure the staples like
poutine and burgers will stay on the menu but I would like to get more into
comfort food like stews, braised meat of some sort, shepherd’s pie, earthy
soups, desserts, etc.</p>
<p>You tell me what you would like to get and I will give it my
best to make it happen. The ideas are limitless and I will change with the
seasons to give you the freshest most delicious food truck food you’ve ever
had.</p><p><b>In The County, For The County, With The County</b><br/>I
 will, as much as possible, be as green as I can be. I have already 
sourced many ingredient suppliers that are local, like the cheese, meat,
 fruits, vegetables and coffee (which is roasted in the county). All of 
the utensils that customers use will be made out of vegetable starch, a 
highly compostable material. Only cardboard containers will be used to 
serve the food. I promise that you won't see any styrofoam containers 
being used in the food truck!  Also,
 a pig farmer close by was delighted to know that I will be giving them 
all of my vegetable waste so they can feed the pigs with fresh food.<br/></p>
<p><b>What I Plan To Do This Season</b></p>
<p>Hopefully, the truck will be ready for August of this year!
I hope to be able to order the food truck by the end of April. Did you know that it takes approximately 4
months for a food truck to be ready?!? While waiting for the truck to be ready for me, I will work on my canned goods and
pre-made items to be ready for the Farmer’s market season. Wellington, Trenton
and Belleville, wait for me, I’m on my way to your market with my jars!</p>
<p>I also plan on working as much as possible on different ways
to market Tabersnack! I want people to
know me even before I am open for business with my truck! I really hope I won’t
have to wait until August to have the truck, or I might go bananas! And when I have my truck, you will hear from
me for sure! As soon as I have it, I will be open to fill you up until you drop
(almost). I sure hope you will want to stop by over and over again. I am looking
forward to that day, but meanwhile, I will enjoy preparing this upcoming spring
and early summer.</p>
<p><b>THANK YOU!</b></p>
<p>I cook with love and passion and I want to serve every
customer as if they were friends eating at my kitchen table. Achieving this
will make me very happy!</p>
<p>Your generosity is greatly appreciated and I want to thank
each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart.  I am looking forward to being overwhelmed
with joy while I cook for you. I know I’ll make you happy by serving you food that
will make you smile and make your mouth water until the last bite!</p>
<p><u>Thank you so much for believing in me and helping my
dream to become a reality.</u></p>
<p>A bientôt!</p>

in Miami by establishing a dynamic resource center for childbirth  education, breastfeeding, parenting and women's health care. Our vision is a work in progress. We founded our non-profit, <a href=""http://www.projectmotherpath.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.projectmotherpath.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project Motherpath </a>about a year after we opened The Gathering Place. <b>We knew that we needed a 501c3 in order to grow our capacity to provide education and support to every family who walked in our doors. </b>Project Motherpath first began in 2009 as BirthGirlz, a non profit organization working to normalize and revalue all aspects of motherhood through education, outreach, community building and activism. BirthGirlz was created by a pair of mamas who wanted to organize a local revolution, and create change - one birth, one mama at a time. <span>From protests to playgroups, the focus of Birthgirlz was on sharing resources and </span><span>building a network to connect moms locally. Birthgirlz provided free community doulas, hosted monthly support groups for postpartum adjustment and infant loss, fundraised to increase women's access to vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) in birth centers across the State, conceived the 2010 and 2011 VBAC Summit conferences, and campaigned to save the nurse-midwifery service at Jackson South Community Hospital. Project Motherpath is a re-visioning of Birthgirlz that maintains the core principles of activism and advocacy and refines the work to focus more broadly on the full spectrum of challenges facing mothers in Miami. </span>​The progress we have made along the way is due to the support and encouragement of our community - our moms and dads and babies, our staff, our mentors and our families. We have a long way to go still and in order to get there we are going to continue to need support.</p><p>We've been asked a lot this year what we want most now that we have accomplished opening <a href=""http://www.magnoliabirthhouse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.magnoliabirthhouse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Magnolia Birth House</a>. We've thought long and hard about how our families and clients could best support the work we want to do moving forward and so here it is - <b>we want you to help us give more women in our community the opportunity to benefit from the support of a doula.</b><br/></p><p></p><p></p><br/><h3>Here's how you can help improve birth outcomes in Miami<br/>
</h3><p>We have a staff of over 
twenty doulas who are committed to Indigo. This alone is a gift. Thus 
far our program has operated without funding using a specific formula: 
providing discounted doula training and mentoring to women in our local 
area who wish to become doulas and have a desire to provide services to
 women who are underserved <b>and</b> having families who contact us for
 services pay as much they are able. We compensate experienced doulas 
who provide care to our clients with stipends regardless of whether 
the client payment covers the full cost of the care they receive. This
 is a sustainable model that for the most part works well - families pay
 what they can, and both experienced doulas and doulas in training are 
available to work with clients who are referred. Why are we fundraising? <b>The need is growing. </b>In recent months we have asked by various organizations in our local 
area to serve families for whom there will be no ability to pay: 
low-income undocumented immigrants, teen mothers (ages 11-19), domestic
and sexual violence survivors and women who are homeless and living in 
shelters. These new opportunities help us get closer to our goal of making doula services available to anyone who wants them. To ensure we are able to meet the demand - we need 
your help. </p><p>Our funding goal for this campaign is $15,000. Here is where your money goes:</p><ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>EDUCATION | childbirth, breastfeeding and parenting education and immediate postpartum support for 100% of clients</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>SERVICES | birth doula services for women who otherwise would not benefit from doula care</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>TRANSPORTATION &amp; CHILDCARE | for many of our neediest clients transportation to the hospital during labor and childcare for their minor children is a huge stressor <br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

 the tools needed to work with at risk populations</li>
<li>10 NEW

women in our community to become Indigo Doulas (pay it forward)</li>
</ul><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span>Your contribution will help make doula services available to women in our community would otherwise be unable to afford them.  <p></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3>Families in our community desperately need doulas!</h3><p>South Florida is a challenging place to have a baby.</p><ul>
<li>
<b>HIGH C-SECTION RATES. </b>Miami has the 
frightening distinction of being a city with one of the 
highest rates of cesarean section in the nation - 1 in 2 women in 
Miami-Dade County gives  birth by surgery. <em>Most hospitals rates are approaching or over 60%. The hospitals with the lowest rates: county funded Jackson Health Systems. Of the ten facilities statewide with the highest cesarean rate, six were located in our county. Patients who deliver by c-section </em>face recovery from  major abdominal surgery alongside the exhausting demands of caring for a new  baby. </li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>FINANCIAL &amp; CULTURAL BARRIERS. </b>Miami-Dade County has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country due to high rates of poverty and immigration. More than 700,000 residents (29.2%) have no health insurance, including Medicaid.</span></li>
<li>
<b>THE HEALTH DISPARITY GAP. </b>1 out of every 7 black babies in Miami-Dade  County is born 
premature. Prematurity is the leading cause of death for babies  in the 
first year of life. Further, the black infant mortality  rate in Miami-Dade is almost 
three times higher than the infant mortality rate for whites. </li>
<li>
<b>ROUTINE INTERVENTION &amp; INDUCTION. </b>Most births typically take place in a hospital room, where women are confined to their beds by continuous fetal monitors and offered little one-to-one labor support. But this is not actually the biggest problem, more egregious is the routine use of interventions that are not medically necessary, alarming rates of induction of labor without medical indication and the lack of informed consent. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PlaceWeGather/photos/pb.270208719667960.-2207520000.1459362757./1138580909497399/?type=3&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stories like the one linked here are not uncommon and success stories are few and far between.</a> None of the hospitals in our county currently have doula 
programs, and some even ban the use of a doula.</li>
<li>
<b><b>POOR BREASTFEEDING OUTCOMES. </b></b>In the majority of area hospitals, mothers and  babies are 
still routinely separated after birth. Breastfeeding support  postpartum
 is often little more than lip-service with formula feeding suggested  
at the first sign of difficulty. 75% of women in Miami-Dade County 
initiate  breastfeeding but only 9.9% continue to 6 months.</li>
</ul><b>Options are disappearing. Interventions are rising. Disparities are 
growing. Women in our community need doulas!</b> Our doulas are contracted through Project Motherpath and do not
 work for
 hospitals, birth centers, or other health care professionals. <span><span><span><span><span><span>Our doulas work for the family, providing
intimate care that is focused on making the birth and postpartum experience the very best it can be. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br/><p></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h3>Here is why doulas matter<br/>
</h3><p>Doula is an ancient Greek word that means “a woman who serves” and is 
now used to refer to an individual trained and experienced in childbirth
 whose role is to provide emotional, physical and informational support 
to a mother and family before, during and immediately following 
childbirth. </p><p><b>Benefits of Doula Care</b></p><p>Decreased medical intervention in labor<a href=""http://www.dona.org/publications/position_paper_birth.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">*</a>:</p><p><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></p><ul>

in Miami by establishing a dynamic resource center for childbirth  education, breastfeeding, parenting and women's health care. Our vision is a work in progress. We founded our non-profit, Project Motherpath about a year after we opened The Gathering Place. We knew that we needed a 501c3 in order to grow our capacity to provide education and support to every family who walked in our doors. Project Motherpath first began in 2009 as BirthGirlz, a non profit organization working to normalize and revalue all aspects of motherhood through education, outreach, community building and activism. BirthGirlz was created by a pair of mamas who wanted to organize a local revolution, and create change - one birth, one mama at a time. From protests to playgroups, the focus of Birthgirlz was on sharing resources and building a network to connect moms locally. Birthgirlz provided free community doulas, hosted monthly support groups for postpartum adjustment and infant loss, fundraised to increase women's access to vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) in birth centers across the State, conceived the 2010 and 2011 VBAC Summit conferences, and campaigned to save the nurse-midwifery service at Jackson South Community Hospital. Project Motherpath is a re-visioning of Birthgirlz that maintains the core principles of activism and advocacy and refines the work to focus more broadly on the full spectrum of challenges facing mothers in Miami. ​The progress we have made along the way is due to the support and encouragement of our community - our moms and dads and babies, our staff, our mentors and our families. We have a long way to go still and in order to get there we are going to continue to need support.We've been asked a lot this year what we want most now that we have accomplished opening Magnolia Birth House. We've thought long and hard about how our families and clients could best support the work we want to do moving forward and so here it is - we want you to help us give more women in our community the opportunity to benefit from the support of a doula.Here's how you can help improve birth outcomes in Miami
We have a staff of over 
twenty doulas who are committed to Indigo. This alone is a gift. Thus 
far our program has operated without funding using a specific formula: 
providing discounted doula training and mentoring to women in our local 
area who wish to become doulas and have a desire to provide services to
 women who are underserved and having families who contact us for
 services pay as much they are able. We compensate experienced doulas 
who provide care to our clients with stipends regardless of whether 
the client payment covers the full cost of the care they receive. This
 is a sustainable model that for the most part works well - families pay
 what they can, and both experienced doulas and doulas in training are 
available to work with clients who are referred. Why are we fundraising? The need is growing. In recent months we have asked by various organizations in our local 
area to serve families for whom there will be no ability to pay: 
low-income undocumented immigrants, teen mothers (ages 11-19), domestic
and sexual violence survivors and women who are homeless and living in 
shelters. These new opportunities help us get closer to our goal of making doula services available to anyone who wants them. To ensure we are able to meet the demand - we need 
your help. Our funding goal for this campaign is $15,000. Here is where your money goes:
EDUCATION | childbirth, breastfeeding and parenting education and immediate postpartum support for 100% of clients
SERVICES | birth doula services for women who otherwise would not benefit from doula care
TRANSPORTATION & CHILDCARE | for many of our neediest clients transportation to the hospital during labor and childcare for their minor children is a huge stressor 
NEEDED
 TRAINING | domestic violence, cultural competency & social justice 
training for all doulas participating in the program to ensure they have
 the tools needed to work with at risk populations
10 NEW 
DOULAS | comprehensive doula & breastfeeding educator training for 
women in our community to become Indigo Doulas (pay it forward)
Your contribution will help make doula services available to women in our community would otherwise be unable to afford them.  Families in our community desperately need doulas!South Florida is a challenging place to have a baby.

HIGH C-SECTION RATES. Miami has the 
frightening distinction of being a city with one of the 
highest rates of cesarean section in the nation - 1 in 2 women in 
Miami-Dade County gives  birth by surgery. Most hospitals rates are approaching or over 60%. The hospitals with the lowest rates: county funded Jackson Health Systems. Of the ten facilities statewide with the highest cesarean rate, six were located in our county. Patients who deliver by c-section face recovery from  major abdominal surgery alongside the exhausting demands of caring for a new  baby. 
FINANCIAL & CULTURAL BARRIERS. Miami-Dade County has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country due to high rates of poverty and immigration. More than 700,000 residents (29.2%) have no health insurance, including Medicaid.

THE HEALTH DISPARITY GAP. 1 out of every 7 black babies in Miami-Dade  County is born 
premature. Prematurity is the leading cause of death for babies  in the 
first year of life. Further, the black infant mortality  rate in Miami-Dade is almost 
three times higher than the infant mortality rate for whites. 

ROUTINE INTERVENTION & INDUCTION. Most births typically take place in a hospital room, where women are confined to their beds by continuous fetal monitors and offered little one-to-one labor support. But this is not actually the biggest problem, more egregious is the routine use of interventions that are not medically necessary, alarming rates of induction of labor without medical indication and the lack of informed consent. Stories like the one linked here are not uncommon and success stories are few and far between. None of the hospitals in our county currently have doula 
programs, and some even ban the use of a doula.

POOR BREASTFEEDING OUTCOMES. In the majority of area hospitals, mothers and  babies are 
still routinely separated after birth. Breastfeeding support  postpartum
 is often little more than lip-service with formula feeding suggested  
at the first sign of difficulty. 75% of women in Miami-Dade County 
initiate  breastfeeding but only 9.9% continue to 6 months.
Options are disappearing. Interventions are rising. Disparities are 
growing. Women in our community need doulas! Our doulas are contracted through Project Motherpath and do not
 work for
 hospitals, birth centers, or other health care professionals. Our doulas work for the family, providing
intimate care that is focused on making the birth and postpartum experience the very best it can be. Here is why doulas matter
Doula is an ancient Greek word that means “a woman who serves” and is 
now used to refer to an individual trained and experienced in childbirth
 whose role is to provide emotional, physical and informational support 
to a mother and family before, during and immediately following 
childbirth. Benefits of Doula CareDecreased medical intervention in labor*:


	Reduces
	need for cesarean by 26%



	Reduces
	the need for forceps or vacuum extractor by 41%



	Reduces
	use of pain medication by 28%



	Reduces
	dissatisfaction with birth by 33%



	Reduces
	length of labor

6 weeks after birth, mothers who had doulas were*:


	Less
	anxious and depressed



	Had
	more confidence with baby



	More
	satisfied w/ partner



	More
	likely to be breastfeeding

Doula are uniquely aware of the struggles, adjustments and questions 
of expectant mothers. They have respect for the wisdom and 
decision-making abilities of parents and do not replace the critical 
role of family members. Doulas make a difference!Here's how your tax-deductible donation makes a difference for moms and babies in Miami

Typically costs for birth doulas services in South Florida range from $600-$3000. Not every expecting woman and her family can afford the full price of these needed services. We
 created INDIGO for families with lower budgets in an effort to 
ensure that doula services could be available to everyone in our 
community. 
Services include:


	prenatal and postpartum visits



	childbirth education



	birth plan preparation



	linkage to community resources

breastfeeding support
Project Motherpath doulas serve women from the third 
trimester 
through birth and until a baby is about six to eight weeks old at low 
/no 
cost. Our doulas are community-based and provide prenatal support and 
parenting education, continuous emotional and physical support 
throughout labor and delivery, and assistance in early postpartum. We 
serve clients in English, Spanish and Creole.Our fundraising goal is large but achievable. Every donation - even a few dollars - will help us reach our goal ! All donations are tax-deductible.

<p>Students Organizing
Against Racism at Tulane (SOAR) was founded in 1999. We are a multiracial,
multicultural organization dedicated to humanistic, anti-racist organizing at
an individual, institutional and cultural level. Our goals are to analyze and
organize around issues of race and racism at Tulane University, as well as to respond
to specific problems on campus. We also strive to forge a meaningful
relationship between Tulane and the greater New Orleans community.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Why We’re Undoing Racism </b></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1240882/files/20150222162833-soarmeeting.jpg?1424651313"" src="""" style=""width: 534.339853300734px; height: 401px;""/></p>
<p>We are launching this
campaign to raise funds so that we can continue to undo racism on our campus
the best way we know how: by hosting the <b>Undoing Racism® Workshop by the People’s
Institute for Survival and Beyond</b> every semester to give students a foundation
and a language to begin meaningful conversations around racism. We have
organized the workshop on Tulane’s campus <b>every semester for 15 years</b> since our
founding. Over the last five years, SOAR has <b>filled</b> the workshops with participants
desiring the knowledge and skills presented to them (40 people per workshop).
Members of the Tulane community and SOAR have asked and requested more events
and programming around race/racism and anti-racist community organizing but unfortunately
our requests are rarely met. Therefore, <b>we are excited</b> to utilize this platform
to help us bring in funds to keep our organization going and people involved in
undoing racism!</p>
<p>Racism has played a <i>crucial role</i> in the history and formation of the
United States, just as it did here at our institution--Tulane University. </p><p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1240878/files/20150222162633-tulane.png?1424651193"" src="""" style=""width: 274.31884057971px; height: 104px;""/></p>Racism
was done and <i>it can be undone</i> through effective anti-racist organizing with,
and in accountability to, the communities most impacted by racism. SOAR
believes that Tulane can and should be at the forefront of acknowledging and
combating racism in the Tulane and New Orleans community. Tulane strives to
connect its values and mission to the needs of the city of New Orleans, the
state, and the nation. <b>Community involvement</b> is now more important than ever as
the university participates in the rebirth of post-Katrina New Orleans. SOAR
believes that in order to fulfill its mission to be a tool for transformational
change in our community, <i>Tulane needs to equip its students, faculty, and staff
to understand the role race relations play in our institution and society</i>. 

<p>Anti-racism is also important
to us because we have seen how racism affects the Tulane environment and its
relations with New Orleans. All of us have experienced racism on a personal,
cultural, and societal level regardless of whether we are on the receiving end
of privilege or oppression and as an organization <b>we care about our
university, our community and the people within it to want to do something about it</b>. </p><p>                                                                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1240888/files/20150222163126-nolalove.jpg?1424651486"" src="""" style=""width: 176.006134969325px; height: 219px;""/></p>We’ve

<p>Undoing Racism® is a
<i>signature</i> workshop of The People's Institute for Survival and Beyond. This weekend-long
training consists of <b>20 hours of instruction and facilitation</b> by two to three
of the People’s Institute’s staff. The multiracial team of trainers includes <b>anti-racist organizing experts</b> who have worked for years with civil, labor, and welfare rights, educational, social service and health reform movements, in addition to youth and grassroots community organizing. This unique workshop is offered by The
People’s Institute which is a <b>national, multiracial, anti-racist network of anti-racist
organizers dedicated to ending racism and other forms of institutional oppression</b>.
Over the last 35 years, they have provided training, consultation, and
leadership development to <b>more than 500,000 people</b> in organizations nationally
and internationally. The People’s Institute believes that <i>racism is the primary
barrier</i> preventing communities from building effective coalitions and overcoming
institutionalized oppression and inequities. Today, The People’s Institute is
recognized as a leader in the field - in a 2002 Aspen Institute survey of
eleven <i>top racial justice organizations</i>, five credited The People’s Institute
with having the <b>most effective anti-racist analysis</b>. The People’s Institute for
Survival and Beyond focuses on understanding what racism is, where it comes
from, how it functions, why it persists and how it can be undone. Their Undoing
Racism workshop utilizes a systemic approach that emphasizes:</p>
<p>· Learning from history,</p>
<p>· Developing leadership,</p>
<p>· Maintaining
accountability to communities,</p>
<p>· Creating networks,</p>
<p>· Undoing internalized
racial oppression, and</p>
<p>· Understanding the role
of organizational gate keeping as a mechanism for perpetuating racism.</p>
Undoing Racism® is an
<b>interactive training</b> that challenges participants to analyze the structures of
power and privilege that hinder social equity and prepares them to be effective
organizers for justice.<div>

</div></div>","Our Story
A Collective of Anti-Racist Organizers…                                      

Students Organizing
Against Racism at Tulane (SOAR) was founded in 1999. We are a multiracial,
multicultural organization dedicated to humanistic, anti-racist organizing at
an individual, institutional and cultural level. Our goals are to analyze and
organize around issues of race and racism at Tulane University, as well as to respond
to specific problems on campus. We also strive to forge a meaningful
relationship between Tulane and the greater New Orleans community.
Why We’re Undoing Racism 
We are launching this
campaign to raise funds so that we can continue to undo racism on our campus
the best way we know how: by hosting the Undoing Racism® Workshop by the People’s
Institute for Survival and Beyond every semester to give students a foundation
and a language to begin meaningful conversations around racism. We have
organized the workshop on Tulane’s campus every semester for 15 years since our
founding. Over the last five years, SOAR has filled the workshops with participants
desiring the knowledge and skills presented to them (40 people per workshop).
Members of the Tulane community and SOAR have asked and requested more events
and programming around race/racism and anti-racist community organizing but unfortunately
our requests are rarely met. Therefore, we are excited to utilize this platform
to help us bring in funds to keep our organization going and people involved in
undoing racism!
Racism has played a crucial role in the history and formation of the
United States, just as it did here at our institution--Tulane University.      Racism
was done and it can be undone through effective anti-racist organizing with,
and in accountability to, the communities most impacted by racism. SOAR
believes that Tulane can and should be at the forefront of acknowledging and
combating racism in the Tulane and New Orleans community. Tulane strives to
connect its values and mission to the needs of the city of New Orleans, the
state, and the nation. Community involvement is now more important than ever as
the university participates in the rebirth of post-Katrina New Orleans. SOAR
believes that in order to fulfill its mission to be a tool for transformational
change in our community, Tulane needs to equip its students, faculty, and staff
to understand the role race relations play in our institution and society. 

Anti-racism is also important
to us because we have seen how racism affects the Tulane environment and its
relations with New Orleans. All of us have experienced racism on a personal,
cultural, and societal level regardless of whether we are on the receiving end
of privilege or oppression and as an organization we care about our
university, our community and the people within it to want to do something about it.                                                                        We’ve
been an organization dedicated to this cause for 16 years and we plan to
continue doing our work in a humanistic and positive light. With your help to
bring the Undoing Racism® Workshop training—which is facilitated by internationally
recognized leaders in the field of anti-racist analysis and instruction--to
our campus, we will be able to achieve our goal of undoing racism at Tulane
University.Our Community Partner


Undoing Racism® is a
signature workshop of The People's Institute for Survival and Beyond. This weekend-long
training consists of 20 hours of instruction and facilitation by two to three
of the People’s Institute’s staff. The multiracial team of trainers includes anti-racist organizing experts who have worked for years with civil, labor, and welfare rights, educational, social service and health reform movements, in addition to youth and grassroots community organizing. This unique workshop is offered by The
People’s Institute which is a national, multiracial, anti-racist network of anti-racist
organizers dedicated to ending racism and other forms of institutional oppression.
Over the last 35 years, they have provided training, consultation, and
leadership development to more than 500,000 people in organizations nationally
and internationally. The People’s Institute believes that racism is the primary
barrier preventing communities from building effective coalitions and overcoming
institutionalized oppression and inequities. Today, The People’s Institute is
recognized as a leader in the field - in a 2002 Aspen Institute survey of
eleven top racial justice organizations, five credited The People’s Institute
with having the most effective anti-racist analysis. The People’s Institute for
Survival and Beyond focuses on understanding what racism is, where it comes
from, how it functions, why it persists and how it can be undone. Their Undoing
Racism workshop utilizes a systemic approach that emphasizes:
· Learning from history,
· Developing leadership,
· Maintaining
accountability to communities,
· Creating networks,
· Undoing internalized
racial oppression, and
· Understanding the role
of organizational gate keeping as a mechanism for perpetuating racism.
Undoing Racism® is an
interactive training that challenges participants to analyze the structures of
power and privilege that hinder social equity and prepares them to be effective
organizers for justice.

The Impact

By participating in the
Undoing Racism® Workshop participants will:
· Develop a common
language and analysis for examining racism in the United States;
· Explore one’s own
connection to institutional racism, particularly as a member of the Tulane
community;
· Understand how all
of us, including white people, are adversely impacted by racism every day, everywhere;
· Address surface
assumptions about how our work is affected by racism, and use that knowledge to
be more effective in public service, and;
· Understand the role
of community organizing and building effective multiracial coalitions as a
means for Undoing Racism.
We believe that
members of the Tulane community who participate in these trainings will start
to form deeper, more authentic relationships with one another. By providing a
comprehensive series of Undoing Racism® trainings, we can foster a community
that acknowledges and understands the role race relations play within Tulane
and New Orleans. These Tulane students, faculty, and staff will have the
support needed to continue lifelong learning around topics such as race
relations, community engagement, and social justice.
From participating in
these workshops, SOAR members and its allies have successfully organized
campaigns, dialogues and responses to:
- 
Tulane University’s
proposal to increase police patrol on campus and around its perimeter in the surrounding New Orleans community;
- 
Tulane’s
accountability with New Orleans, especially along the facet of volunteerism
and community service;
- 
The Mike Brown and Eric Garner
decisions in November and December 2014 in response to racist police brutality, the disproportionate
incarceration of Black males in America and how this relates to Tulane and the
New Orleans community; 
               
- 
Cultural appropriation on college campuses, especially during Halloween;
- 
Those who organize
within the social justice community on Tulane's campus (Women’s, Environmental, Queer, Labor Movements, etc) we have partnered
with to help them further their analysis and guide them to anti-racist resources;
- 
White allyship;
-  Regaining our humanity by caucusing so that we can form meaningful relationships with each other and create a space for healing; 
- 
Facilitating Skillshares
and conversations on films such as Dear White People;
- 
 Meeting with administration, faculty, and staff of various departments to express our concerns of racism within our institution;
-  Tulane's threat to close the Department of African & African Diaspora Studies on our campus;
- And many more…
Not only do we
organize together, but we are a family too! We have dinner together, hang out and have fun! #SOARFam (See our gallery!)

<p>East Bay Coffee Company is unlike any coffee house
you've visited - we promise! Do you enjoy organic fair trade coffee? House-made
syrups &amp; drink creations? Healthy, hand crafted treats? How about live
music &amp; art installations? </p>
<p>East Bay Coffee is a, third wave coffeehouse that
serves exceptional organic coffee that is sourced by fair trade practices.
Created for lovers of coffee, their beans are uniquely roasted locally using
oak wood, which maximizes the flavor of every drink. One of the things
that makes East Bay Coffee unique is it's a music and arts driven destination
venue. They host concerts, book signings, art displays, lectures, poetry slams,
and open-mic nights, worship and faith-based events.</p>
<p>The flagship location for East Bay Coffee Company is in
""Old Town"" Pinole, California where they serve the City of Pinole and
it's surrounding East Bay communities including Hercules, El Cerrito, Berkeley,
El Sobrante, Richmond, Crockett, and Rodeo. I am been blown away at the amount
of community support they’ve received. </p>
<p>I approached East Bay a few months ago and asked if they
would support my efforts to launch an East Bay Coffee initiative in the
Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco.</p>
<p>The answer was a resounding YES! With their help and the
relationships and support established with our Real Life Church family, we are
taking this step of faith and moving forward.  </p>

<p>Right now we are in the
beginning stages, which is exciting for everyone! Why? It gives you the unique
opportunity to partner with us as pivotal founders!  We’re launching this
campaign to raise funds, awareness and to offer you some cool perks and a
chance to join this initiative to give back to a community and help to
influence lives with faith.</p>
<p>This vision is costly which is
why we are coming to you for help. Here is a small look into what we are
looking at to launch successfully.</p>
<p>1)<b>Building Fund</b> <b>:</b> the
City of San Francisco is the 2nd most expensive city to live in or own a
business in the United States. Strangely enough, commercial business properties
are in hot demand! Our building fund, which will cover our build out, property
rent and operations costs is roughly $100,000.</p>
<p>2) <b>Espresso Machines and
Equipment:</b>Opening a new coffee house means purchasing new
equipment (which we're pretty stoked about) that will make us more efficient in
serving you. Estimated cost $20,000 - $30,000.</p>
<p>Why then are we only asking for
$40,000? Because we think it's insane to ask for more. We're working hard every
day to find avenues to finance and get this work done as cheaply and
efficiently as possible. We've created stretch goals with this campaign because
well... every bit helps. Thank you for making HopeforHaight possible.</p>

East Bay Coffee Company is unlike any coffee house
you've visited - we promise! Do you enjoy organic fair trade coffee? House-made
syrups & drink creations? Healthy, hand crafted treats? How about live
music & art installations? 
East Bay Coffee is a, third wave coffeehouse that
serves exceptional organic coffee that is sourced by fair trade practices.
Created for lovers of coffee, their beans are uniquely roasted locally using
oak wood, which maximizes the flavor of every drink. One of the things
that makes East Bay Coffee unique is it's a music and arts driven destination
venue. They host concerts, book signings, art displays, lectures, poetry slams,
and open-mic nights, worship and faith-based events.
The flagship location for East Bay Coffee Company is in
""Old Town"" Pinole, California where they serve the City of Pinole and
it's surrounding East Bay communities including Hercules, El Cerrito, Berkeley,
El Sobrante, Richmond, Crockett, and Rodeo. I am been blown away at the amount
of community support they’ve received. 
I approached East Bay a few months ago and asked if they
would support my efforts to launch an East Bay Coffee initiative in the
Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco.
The answer was a resounding YES! With their help and the
relationships and support established with our Real Life Church family, we are
taking this step of faith and moving forward.  




Bringing East Bay Coffee to Haight-Ashbury





Right now we are in the
beginning stages, which is exciting for everyone! Why? It gives you the unique
opportunity to partner with us as pivotal founders!  We’re launching this
campaign to raise funds, awareness and to offer you some cool perks and a
chance to join this initiative to give back to a community and help to
influence lives with faith.
This vision is costly which is
why we are coming to you for help. Here is a small look into what we are
looking at to launch successfully.
1)Building Fund : the
City of San Francisco is the 2nd most expensive city to live in or own a
business in the United States. Strangely enough, commercial business properties
are in hot demand! Our building fund, which will cover our build out, property
rent and operations costs is roughly $100,000.
2) Espresso Machines and
Equipment:Opening a new coffee house means purchasing new
equipment (which we're pretty stoked about) that will make us more efficient in
serving you. Estimated cost $20,000 - $30,000.
Why then are we only asking for
$40,000? Because we think it's insane to ask for more. We're working hard every
day to find avenues to finance and get this work done as cheaply and
efficiently as possible. We've created stretch goals with this campaign because
well... every bit helps. Thank you for making HopeforHaight possible.

The Perks: what you're getting! 
Pounds, pounds, pounds! If you haven’t had our coffee, we will hook you up with our little bags of fresh-roasted joy and make you a believer.




East Bay Coffee Mug: Sip that cup o' joe in style! These porcelain mugs are functional and will represent East Bay wherever you go. 



The Holdster! We have been looking for a non-disposable option for our hot and cold drinks for some time now. The Holdster is a great product that was launched through a crowedfunding campaign (near and dear to our hearts!) that provides reusable stay and/or travel cup options. All Holdsters are hand-made and feature a vegetable based tanning process, they are also hand-riveted which make for a for a solid, long-lasting carrier for your favorite drinks from East Bay Coffee.


 


Limited Edition East Bay Coffee Company Candle: These candles will give you the perfect excuse to slow down and relax, knowing you've helped fund our sweet shoppe. 100% homemade, soy wax and in some yummy scents, these are simple yet unique! Perfect for gift giving or to enjoy yourself! 

Our Founders Club: The founders wall was an ingenious idea from our Head Barista Billy - what is a better way to display our gratitude than to hang your cup for everyone to see?! The picture below is to give you a visual of what we're thinking but the actual wall will vary in design.



    Other Ways You Can Help! We understand the economic climate and that sometimes your just not in a position to help some strange coffee people! If you're into what we do... tell people!

<h3><br/></h3>
<div>Hi there! My name is <b>Kaare Long</b> and I'm a Digital Marketing Specialist. I provide Public Relations and Social Media Support to small businesses in Vancouver, B.C.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In 2013 I found myself suddenly single, and as a 42 year-old mother of 2 daughters, I was quite afraid of 'getting out there' into the dating world again. The online dating sites like POF, Tinder, and Cupid just seemed to be so impersonal, overwhelming, and stressful. I played along though, and found I ended up having to weed through the inevitable weirdos and crazy messages to the point that it became a second job.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There HAD to be a better way! During a conversation one night with one of my younger interns, <b>Adam Bajan</b>, who was himself single,  we started chatting about how difficult it was to meet someone in Vancouver as a single person. Age didn't seem to matter, and gender and sexual preference didn't seem to make a difference either.  After reading some damning articles online, written by both men and women, my team and I decided that there was definitely a 'cold' problem in Vancouver that had nothing to do with the weather. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>An icy reputation comes with Vancouver and many other Canadian Cities and we decided to go out there and see if this was really true. We tested the idea on Social Media sites and got a flurry of responses that indicated this might be a 'thing' that people felt strongly about. Then we embarked on a braver mission and I grabbed a video camera, Adam donned a big sign on his shirt and we walked around Gastown, Yaletown and Downtown Vancouver for 4 hours one sunny Sunday. What we found was surprising, and it also backed up the many bad 'raps' we had heard about Vancouver being a 'cold city' to meet people in. This was disappointing to say the least, and both of us realized why neither of us felt comfortable approaching strangers just to say 'Hi!' and maybe meet someone new. Especially when thinking about dating prospects, that just seemed IMPOSSIBLE in this city.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This video created a massive response in the city with opposite viewpoints, both passionately defending their beliefs. ""Vancouver is REALLY hard to meet people in!"" ""I hate being single in Vancouver"", and "" Vancouver is awesome, don't bash our city like that!"" So - we decided to create a city-wide campaign to prove the theory, and the reputation of Vancouver WRONG! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>#sayhitoastranger</b> was born. A campaign that begins online leading up to the weekend event, and culminates in a full weekend of saying 'Hi!' to strangers. Local  businesses also got involved and gave out FREE goodies if participants came in and said 'Hi!' which also supported all our local shops! In one weekend, we warmed the city up for many folks and took tons of photos and videos. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>After this pilot project, we realized that The city we live in really just needs a way to break down the barriers that we have all put around ourselves, be it 'stranger danger', shyness, or fear of any kind. Maybe we have a weekend where we can all just let it go and feel free to say 'Hi!' to anyone we pass by. Then perhaps we can begin to trust each other as a community and begin to meet more friends, connections, and perhaps future romantic partners!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We want to bring this amazingly fun and connective weekend to Vancouver again and eventually other cities around the world and we have officially launched the dates of the second installment. </div>
<div><b>Feb 13-15th, 2015: Valentines #sayhitoastranger!</b></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>We need YOUR help to make this BIGGER and BETTER than our pilot project. We have a full production team ready to volunteer their services to get this party happening, but we need financial assistance to ensure that everyone hears about this campaign and has the opportunity to join in!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Does YOUR city need a #sahitoastranger day? Help us make it possible to bring this event to your hometown.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Be a part of the founding community of partners by contributing whatever you think you can to help us build this weekend for you! </div>
<div>And BTW - I am NO LONGER single! :-)</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We're asking for $20,000 in cold hard cash to pay for the following:</p> <ul> <li>Design and printing for wearable items that can be utilized during the weekend. A #sayhitoastranger T-shirt, wristband, or coffee mug!</li> <li>Design and printing for 'We #sayhitoastranger!' signs for all of the local shops  that partner with us to encourage visitors to come in and get FREE stuff!</li> <li>A video and production crew to follow us around during the weekend and talk to strangers and shops as people #sayhitostrangers and get FREE stuff! Also, we want to hear what YOU think about Vancouver, and what you feel we need to be able to connect more to each other.</li>
<li>Website maintenance - We have launched our beautiful website, but we need support in maintaining it. All sponsors of this initiative and community partners will be on this website! And that means YOU! If you contribute ANY financial amount, we will put your name on the website. We will also post the schedule on this website so that you can visit as many participating partnering shops to get much FREE stuff and meet many new peeps as possible!</li>
<li>Administration costs to assist us in streamlining this process so we can do it again next year! And then maybe move on to another city that needs some warming up! (Do we hear Toronto being whispered?)</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact of this Campaign will be felt by ALL who value community, connection and 'buying local.' Not only will we be shattering our barriers to saying 'Hi!', we will be supporting all of our local businesses. Coffee shops, bakeries, art shops, bookstores, yoga studios - ALL sorts of businesses that need our support to thrive!</p>
<p>This was our success last year with only 2 weeks to create, launch and execute this awesome weekend.</p>

Hi there! My name is Kaare Long and I'm a Digital Marketing Specialist. I provide Public Relations and Social Media Support to small businesses in Vancouver, B.C.

In 2013 I found myself suddenly single, and as a 42 year-old mother of 2 daughters, I was quite afraid of 'getting out there' into the dating world again. The online dating sites like POF, Tinder, and Cupid just seemed to be so impersonal, overwhelming, and stressful. I played along though, and found I ended up having to weed through the inevitable weirdos and crazy messages to the point that it became a second job.

There HAD to be a better way! During a conversation one night with one of my younger interns, Adam Bajan, who was himself single,  we started chatting about how difficult it was to meet someone in Vancouver as a single person. Age didn't seem to matter, and gender and sexual preference didn't seem to make a difference either.  After reading some damning articles online, written by both men and women, my team and I decided that there was definitely a 'cold' problem in Vancouver that had nothing to do with the weather. 

An icy reputation comes with Vancouver and many other Canadian Cities and we decided to go out there and see if this was really true. We tested the idea on Social Media sites and got a flurry of responses that indicated this might be a 'thing' that people felt strongly about. Then we embarked on a braver mission and I grabbed a video camera, Adam donned a big sign on his shirt and we walked around Gastown, Yaletown and Downtown Vancouver for 4 hours one sunny Sunday. What we found was surprising, and it also backed up the many bad 'raps' we had heard about Vancouver being a 'cold city' to meet people in. This was disappointing to say the least, and both of us realized why neither of us felt comfortable approaching strangers just to say 'Hi!' and maybe meet someone new. Especially when thinking about dating prospects, that just seemed IMPOSSIBLE in this city.

This video created a massive response in the city with opposite viewpoints, both passionately defending their beliefs. ""Vancouver is REALLY hard to meet people in!"" ""I hate being single in Vancouver"", and "" Vancouver is awesome, don't bash our city like that!"" So - we decided to create a city-wide campaign to prove the theory, and the reputation of Vancouver WRONG! 


#sayhitoastranger was born. A campaign that begins online leading up to the weekend event, and culminates in a full weekend of saying 'Hi!' to strangers. Local  businesses also got involved and gave out FREE goodies if participants came in and said 'Hi!' which also supported all our local shops!

Maybe we have a weekend where we can all just let it go and feel free to say 'Hi!' to anyone we pass by. Then perhaps we can begin to trust each other as a community and begin to meet more friends, connections, and perhaps future romantic partners!

We want to bring this amazingly fun and connective weekend to Vancouver again and eventually other cities around the world and we have officially launched the dates of the second installment. 
Feb 13-15th, 2015: Valentines #sayhitoastranger!

We need YOUR help to make this BIGGER and BETTER than our pilot project. We have a full production team ready to volunteer their services to get this party happening, but we need financial assistance to ensure that everyone hears about this campaign and has the opportunity to join in!

Does YOUR city need a #sahitoastranger day? Help us make it possible to bring this event to your hometown.

Be a part of the founding community of partners by contributing whatever you think you can to help us build this weekend for you! 
And BTW - I am NO LONGER single! :-)
   What We Need & What You Get We're asking for $20,000 in cold hard cash to pay for the following:  Design and printing for wearable items that can be utilized during the weekend. A #sayhitoastranger T-shirt, wristband, or coffee mug! Design and printing for 'We #sayhitoastranger!' signs for all of the local shops  that partner with us to encourage visitors to come in and get FREE stuff! A video and production crew to follow us around during the weekend and talk to strangers and shops as people #sayhitostrangers and get FREE stuff! Also, we want to hear what YOU think about Vancouver, and what you feel we need to be able to connect more to each other.
Website maintenance - We have launched our beautiful website, but we need support in maintaining it. All sponsors of this initiative and community partners will be on this website! And that means YOU! If you contribute ANY financial amount, we will put your name on the website. We will also post the schedule on this website so that you can visit as many participating partnering shops to get much FREE stuff and meet many new peeps as possible!
Administration costs to assist us in streamlining this process so we can do it again next year! And then maybe move on to another city that needs some warming up! (Do we hear Toronto being whispered?)    The Impact The impact of this Campaign will be felt by ALL who value community, connection and 'buying local.' Not only will we be shattering our barriers to saying 'Hi!', we will be supporting all of our local businesses. Coffee shops, bakeries, art shops, bookstores, yoga studios - ALL sorts of businesses that need our support to thrive!
This was our success last year with only 2 weeks to create, launch and execute this awesome weekend.

<h3>Major-Scale Energy Work</h3>
<p>I have done great works for the benefit of humanity in general as well, not just individuals. So now I am praying for the good karma for my great work, for my dream to come true.  I am a young 56yo with plenty to give and teach and mentor  and some very lucky young farmers are going to become fabulous healers if I can raise the funds!  I hope you consider this, I pray and Thank You if you will finance my migration to a happy homeland of love and joy</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
<p>Carol Thornton</p>
</div>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
</div><div> <p>The $50,000:</p>
<p>1) 25,000 is the required ""buy in"" that prosperous Eco Villages put towards cottage industries, which are chosen by group vote. I'm hoping for approval to breed Dexter miniature cows. Or pitch in to an already-existing human-scale industry that is growing.</p>
<p>2) the other $25,000 is to build a tiny house or yurt for me to live in. </p>
<p>If I don't receive the total amount, I can at least begin to build some sort of hovel, while I'm paying cheap rent for a single room. I've rented rooms in peoples' houses many times and I'm an excellent housemate. Another option is to lease a small bit of land from a landowner and start my own cottage industry.</p>
<p>And I know I will be a fabulous community member, especially with my healing abilities!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Helping the World Be A Better Place </h3> <p>I believe Eco Villages will survive climate changes and droughts, in Washington and Oregon. If you contribute to my campaign, according to Eastern thought, then you would deserve the right to reincarnate to the Village that you helped and nurtured with your contribution.  </p>
<p>Living close to nature is a gorgeous and happy way to become enlightened, and I believe your contribution makes you part of that future ""tribe"" of peeps that Mother Nature herself will protect and sustain.  I have no particular religious affiliation because I believe Truth is at the heart of all religions, and I can and do communicate with animals, plants, Consciousness. Everything is God, and opening to communication with all things makes people extremely happy. I want to play the role of ""grandma"" to the millenials that are raising the next generation, and who are likely to survive all global challenges. </p>
<p>When I apply for residency, I think that a wise administrator will ask me for a distance healing session, and, once experienced, the astonishment will rapidly put me at the top of the list as a valued prospective member. Holographic healing is virtually unknown, and yet unbelievably remarkable.  Its effects can be subtle, but within a few months, very significant changes have occurred in the person's personality, consciousness, and life, and then the fascination with the methodology truly begins.  I have often helped people that doctors gave up on, and I want to be of service to a community of ""preppers"", or hippies, whatever you want to call us  =D</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute, but want some good karma for your own future survival of these radical times of economic and climate change, please use the Indiegogo share tools and ask your folkies to visit me here.  Thank you, Dearie!!!</p>

So now I am praying for the good karma for my great work, for my dream to come true.  I am a young 56yo with plenty to give and teach and mentor  and some very lucky young farmers are going to become fabulous healers if I can raise the funds!  I hope you consider this, I pray and Thank You if you will finance my migration to a happy homeland of love and joy
Thank You
Carol Thornton

Short Summary
 The $50,000:
1) 25,000 is the required ""buy in"" that prosperous Eco Villages put towards cottage industries, which are chosen by group vote. I'm hoping for approval to breed Dexter miniature cows. Or pitch in to an already-existing human-scale industry that is growing.
2) the other $25,000 is to build a tiny house or yurt for me to live in. 
If I don't receive the total amount, I can at least begin to build some sort of hovel, while I'm paying cheap rent for a single room. I've rented rooms in peoples' houses many times and I'm an excellent housemate. Another option is to lease a small bit of land from a landowner and start my own cottage industry.
And I know I will be a fabulous community member, especially with my healing abilities!
    Helping the World Be A Better Place  I believe Eco Villages will survive climate changes and droughts, in Washington and Oregon. If you contribute to my campaign, according to Eastern thought, then you would deserve the right to reincarnate to the Village that you helped and nurtured with your contribution.  
Living close to nature is a gorgeous and happy way to become enlightened, and I believe your contribution makes you part of that future ""tribe"" of peeps that Mother Nature herself will protect and sustain.  I have no particular religious affiliation because I believe Truth is at the heart of all religions, and I can and do communicate with animals, plants, Consciousness. Everything is God, and opening to communication with all things makes people extremely happy. I want to play the role of ""grandma"" to the millenials that are raising the next generation, and who are likely to survive all global challenges. 
When I apply for residency, I think that a wise administrator will ask me for a distance healing session, and, once experienced, the astonishment will rapidly put me at the top of the list as a valued prospective member. Holographic healing is virtually unknown, and yet unbelievably remarkable.  Its effects can be subtle, but within a few months, very significant changes have occurred in the person's personality, consciousness, and life, and then the fascination with the methodology truly begins.  I have often helped people that doctors gave up on, and I want to be of service to a community of ""preppers"", or hippies, whatever you want to call us  =D

    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute, but want some good karma for your own future survival of these radical times of economic and climate change, please use the Indiegogo share tools and ask your folkies to visit me here.  Thank you, Dearie!!!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Spabear
is changing the beauty industry through innovation while striving to offer  something new and exciting.  We are creating a new way to get your nails,
waxing and facials done by changing the way that people meet their beauticians
and receive their services. How does it work? Anyone can meet a professional
and book a service all from the convenience of their computer or smartphone. Then,
they come to the client’s house or apartment to perform the service.  </p>
<p>Spabear
is the fun, convenient and affordable new way to book beauty services in your
home! </p>
<p>It's
such a luxury to receive beauty services in your home but what is really
exciting is that  these services are also really affordable. How? We are cutting out the ""middle man""
(such as a salon) and  clients (“spa
mem-bears”) and beauticians (“bear-ticians”) are able to create real, lasting
relationships. Clients have the potential to earn some great rewards and gifts
and to refer friends in order to earn discounted services. This system is also
beneficial to the beauticians as they are able to work outside of a salon
environment and have the potential to make much more money. In this high-tech
world with so many busy people and such active lives, Spabear simply makes
sense. It is the next logical step in the beauty industry and has the
potential to change it forever.</p>

 my rental was sold in November, 2014, in the middle of the holiday 
season. I had plans to move in the spring; after a successful holiday season and winter production 
cycle. However, an unsolicited real estate offer in October 2014, had me making and 
selling honey while negotiating a new lease, transforming a spare 
bedroom into a honey kitchen; plus packing and moving the old 
honey kitchen, my life, my bees and my Goldendoodle, Honey Dew. The last batches of 2014 creamed honey were made in the new kitchen.Now it's time to finish the kitchen  and get this honey 
business back on track.  To demonstrate my commitment to this campaign 
and bee conservation I post a daily bee
 fact and honey recipe right here under the UPDATE tab.  In addition to your particular perk, on March 16th all funders receive a PDF booklet, ""30 INDIEGOGO DAYS of BEE FACTS and HONEY RECIPES"".  This series is also available on my ARTISAN CREAMED HONEY blog. My ACTION LIST  & budget for this campaign are provided below.  60,000 bees and I applaud your involvement.   Carol Hagen, artisan and beekeeper   
Artisan Creamed Honey  is made with Middle Tennessee
Clover honey or East Tennessee Sourwood tree blossom honey. My unique
crystallizing recipe transforms liquid honey into a creamy spread. The culinary
goal is for you to taste the unique flavors of the honey; followed by a subtle
flavor of infused organic ground cardamom, cinnamon, cinnamon-clove or orange
essential oil. It really does ignite smiles and laughter with rolling eyes and
calls for ""You gotta try this!""

Tennessee Honey Bar  refers to my Nashville Farmers Market 
booth where you are welcome to sample East and Middle Tennessee raw 
honey and pollen; samples are available at restaurants and specialty 
markets where ARTISAN CREAMED HONEY is served. The honey I offer is from
 family owned and operated apiaries with 800 to 1000 hives; they work 
24-7 caring for healthy bees in the Tennessee hills and mountains.   Bee Poster by Greg Decker - $25 PerkI am a beekeeper, but my focus is on community education. I take an 
observation hive to the farmers market, garden clubs and festivals. I 
introduce bees as our busy and gentle benefactors; then we discuss 
conservation and ""beeing"" aware of how to protect honey bees and native 
bees from poison.                                 First batch from the new kitchen.To move forward  I must:   

Complete my new honey kitchen  to Certified Domestic Kitchen standards

Update branding  with my new kitchen address and new product titles

Triple the volume of honey purchased  for creaming and for resale

Hire part-time help.  I believe in paying a living wage of
 $15 hourly and already allow $1.25 per jar for labor.  I am able to 
make a reasonable profit and produce an exceptional product at a price 
people are willing to pay. 12 jars @ $1.25 = $15

<h2><span>PENS4Life Distribution Strategy</span></h2>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Providing safe water to majority of rural Zambians in need is still a major challenge. About less than 60% of the rural population in Zambia has access to safe water.  The population without access to clean and safe water access their water from unsafe water sources that include shallow wells, dams and streams. To address this need, there is need for alternative methods to ensure that households have access to safe drinking water. Distribution of Steripens will aim at addressing this challenge to ensure that target rural communities especially children have access to clean and safe water and ultimately improved health.</p>
<p>The proposed distribution of Steripens will be done in 3 phases;</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Phase 1 - Pilot Stage</p></li>
<li><p>Phase 2 – Actual Execution (Distribution at Large scale)</p></li>
<li><p>Phase 3 – Monitoring</p></li>
</ol>
<br/><p>Phase 1: The Pilot Stage</p>
<p>Before rolling out distribution of steripens on a large scale there is need to conduct a pilot that will be of great significance towards informing how distribution should be done. The steripens are new purification devices to be introduced in Zambia thus the need to conduct a pilot. The pilot intervention will involve the distribution of steripens which are water purification devices through rural local authorities that have the mandate for improved provision of water supply and sanitation in rural districts. The Local authorities work closely with Ministry of Health in an effort to improve the lives of the rural populations in the provision of water and sanitation.  </p>
<p>During this phase the partners involved will have to be trained in the use of the devices before taking them down to intended pilot groups. The phase will also focus on sensitizing the users on the use of the devices and the importance of water purification and proper storage of the purified water to avoid recontamination. </p>
<p>Pilot Target Groups</p>
<p>The proposed distribution target groups will include schools and communities/villages without access to clean and safe water.</p>
<p>Objectives of the Pilot</p>
<p>The objectives of the pilot will include the following;</p>
<ul><li><p>To test whether promoting and distributing of steripens through local councils or RHCs can be sustainable, and the extent to which such a model can create increases in correct and continued use of steripens among the rural populations. </p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p> Guide which target group would  make better utilisation of the device</p></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Have a projected number of possible beneficiaries</p></li>
<li><p>What is the acceptance rate of the steripens among target group? </p></li>
<li><p>What is the extent of correct use of Steripens among target group? </p></li>
<li><p>What are the triggers and barriers to the continued use of steripens? </p></li>
<li><p>What other efforts/inputs are needed to stimulate demand for the use of steripens to the target group?</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><p>Pilot Duration and Areas</p>
<p>The proposed pilot period is 3 months and the council and MOE should be in a position to provide with necessary information on the use of the steripens on a monthly basis.  A simple questionnaire will be developed that will help capture necessary information that will help tailor the large scale distribution in an effective and sustainable way. Four districts have been proposed for the pilot and these are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Petauke</p></li>
<li><p>Sinda</p></li>
<li><p>Chisamba</p></li>
<li><p>Kapiri Mposhi</p></li>
</ol>
<br/><p>Phase 2: Actual Execution</p>
<p>Phase 1 will feed into phase two as the information gathered will help plan for large scale distribution of steripens.  All the distribution requirements will be well understood from phase 1. </p>
<br/><p>Phase 3: Monitoring</p>This phase will involve continuous monitoring of the distribution to ensure the right target groups benefit and that the devices are in use. <br/>

What is the acceptance rate of the steripens among target group? 
What is the extent of correct use of Steripens among target group? 
What are the triggers and barriers to the continued use of steripens? 
What other efforts/inputs are needed to stimulate demand for the use of steripens to the target group?

Pilot Duration and Areas
The proposed pilot period is 3 months and the council and MOE should be in a position to provide with necessary information on the use of the steripens on a monthly basis.  A simple questionnaire will be developed that will help capture necessary information that will help tailor the large scale distribution in an effective and sustainable way. Four districts have been proposed for the pilot and these are:

Petauke
Sinda
Chisamba
Kapiri Mposhi

Phase 2: Actual Execution
Phase 1 will feed into phase two as the information gathered will help plan for large scale distribution of steripens.  All the distribution requirements will be well understood from phase 1. 
Phase 3: MonitoringThis phase will involve continuous monitoring of the distribution to ensure the right target groups benefit and that the devices are in use.",0.0,1,"3 Campaigns

What You Get


Oh, our perks are the BEST! You could end up on our PERMANENT contributor hall of fame, get a Thank You card written and signed by team VidaMark, and/or receive a personal ""Thank You"" video from the team through email.
However, by the chance our campaign does NOT succeed, the funds raised would be used for securing our first employee and marketing only.




    Risks & Challenges Unfortunately, the word ""homeless"" has a negative connotation. This is our biggest challenge in growing VidaMark

Other Ways You Can Help There are more ways to help without donating and contributing. Get the word out. Shout and make some noise about our campaign. Use the indiegogo share tools to help.

<h3><b>Riding Beyond Taking Root, Growing </b></h3>
<p>Amazing things happened for all of us last year at Riding Beyond -- life-changing interactions for breast cancer survivors, their friends and family, as well as our volunteers and visiting health care professionals.  Our video gives you a taste of that, and there's more at our website <a href=""http://ridingbeyond.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ridingbeyond.org</a> and our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ridingbeyond"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a>. </p>
<p>Over 60 people participated directly in either our individual sessions or our all-day group sessions. The three horses who participated demonstrated remarkable talents for interacting in precise, intelligent, compassionate, and wise ways, way beyond our expectations.  </p>
<p><b>National audiences are interested:</b> Riding Beyond was shared with equine professionals through presentations at three national conferences. American Breast Cancer Society did a feature on us, as did the public television show Immense Possibilities.  We were regularly featured on local tv and radio and in the newspapers. </p>
<p>Now we enter our second year, growing a firm foundation as the seeds we planted last year take root. After this year, we will qualify to apply for larger foundation funding. Your support will help us grow the program toward that goal to serve more women. We have three all day events scheduled, and we have a second horse joining the team to expand our offerings: golden-haired Gabe. </p>
<ul> </ul> <p>Your gift, whether small or large, makes Riding Beyond possible, since we offer sessions free to breast cancer survivors. It is greatly appreciated and makes a difference, a world of difference to these women, as they testify. </p>

were handled last year. Those savings, however, are offset by increased expenses
for printing and informing the public about our program as well as adding a

<p>I live in Korangi where women are not “supposed to” be out and about
much. I used to get restless when surrounded by massive heaps of garbage all
around my area. But hey, what can a girl do right? Wrong. </p>
<p>With the guidance of Karachi Youth Support Network (KYSN), I was able to
start a cleaning project within my community. Taking the initiative was not
easy mainly because of the stereotypical thought processes that prevail in our
society. But seeing my persistence and dedication towards the cause, slowly and
gradually a lot of people started to join me in my venture. I am currently
working as an Ambassador for KYSN and I organize various trainings and
workshops in my community with their assistance. KYSN has played a vital role
in instilling positivity in me and developing leadership qualities in me.</p>
<p><b>Abdul Azeem Khatri</b></p>
<p>My life has been nothing short of challenging after I met
with an accident which left me wheelchair bound. Lack of resources forced me to
drop out of college and give up everything I once held dear. It was natural
that I went into deep depression and became totally clueless about what to do
with my life. I still remember the first time I went to KYSN, the thing that
impressed me the most was the normality with which their entire team treated
me. There were no side glances or sympathetic looks. I registered myself as a
member that day only and became a regular visitor of KYSN. One of their team
members mentored me one-on-one and encouraged me to do something substantial
with my life. That’s when I decided to get out of my shell and talk to people
around me. I started giving motivational speeches to people in my area. I also
enrolled for private education. </p>
<p>The impact resonated from me and touched my family too as my
mother set up a food stall at KYSN’s regular event, Bazaar. </p>
<p>For me, KYSN has been literally a ray of hope. The self
confidence and acceptance which it instilled in me has renewed my will to fully
live my life. My faith in my abilities was further restored when I was
connected to a job opportunity by KYSN. 12 KYSN members were selected along
with me to avail this opportunity and to give us our best chance, we were all
given training by KYSN on how to ace interviews. Who does this much for you?

<div>I am an individual the same as everyone else but one with a dream.  My dream is to come up with a new item that everyone could use. I have had this dream since i was a child. Even as a child I would look at things and see the improvements that could be done to any item. I would ask why do they not just do it like this instead of this. That question has stuck with me my whole life. Now I am making this dream come true. </div>
<div>This campaign is to make an ordinary everyday item better to use and easier to use at the same time. Who knew just adding a clip to something could greatly improve it. Think about it your pocket knife what holds it on to your pocket, a clip and to think back in the day you had to have a leather case to hold it on to a belt. Lets take the ink pen for example as well, what holds the ink pen to your shirt pocket at work a clip. So with that being said why not add a clip to the lighter so it can to clip to your pockets. Think about it if your a smoker and you are in need of your lighter but your pocket has money and change in it, you got to dig around in that pocket of yours and risking not just pulling out your lighter but your money as well. The money in your pocket has now fallen to the ground and you did not notice it so now you just lost 20 bucks. If only you had a clip to that lighter you could of just pulled it out from the clipped position of your pants pocket. No digging around dodging your money, change or any other items that may be in your way to retrieving your lighter. Not just smokers though campers, candle lovers, fire place owners, and the list goes on. Everyone has a need of fire. </div>
<div>Now imagine the impact of this product this new item being out there for the world to see, to use, to hold in their hands, and knowing we worked together to make this happen. This will change the way you see a lighter and its not one of those external lighter holders that extend and dangle and the cord is always to short. That thing you can loose than what you are out o few bucks but with this each one you buy has the clip on it ready to go. Ask your self do you buy an ink pen with out a clip. That is how i want this to be, I want it to be like that and as long as we work together on this one it can be just like that. I know when i buy pens i do not buy one with out the clip on it so I can have it at the ready. I use a pen on a very constant level as well as a lighter and I am sick of digging in my pocket to dig that thing out. I personally have lost money due to pulling my lighter out of my pocket, and my money fell out and boom there it goes. I did not even know it till it was to late and i went to pay for something and realized it was gone when I put my hands in my pocket to get it. I can tell you i was pretty mad at that point. So this great improvement to an item we all know and use is not only to make it easy like the ink pen or knife but it can save you as it could have saved me the trouble of loosing things like money. Lets do it lets turn the page to the way we see lighters lets make it happen together lets change the world. Well the world of lighters.</div>
</div><div>OK we have covered what this item is, what it can do, and how it is very useful. Now lets go over the funding. To get this started it is going to take 15,000 dollars. The money will be given to a company who has already been in the process of developing this new product The lighter Clip. Now after they get their money they will begin promoting and marketing this new item. I personally can not market it my self like how it needs to be done but that is why i have this company helping me out. World Patent Marketing is the name of this company. A very good and helpful place if you ever have a great idea. During this journey i have been on with them so far they have done a market study on this item and they score it between 1 and 79. Now 1 being the lowest and 79 being highest. This product The Lighter Clip scored at a 72 now that is awesome. Very excited about it. It is marketable and very much worth proceeding further. And now here i am asking for you all to join me in this venture. Now if for some reason we do not make the full amount that is ok no problem i will still give what I got to this company to still keep this ball rolling. Now for everyone who chooses to donate to this venture and join in on changing the way we see lighters you will be paid back and than some. Lets say you put in a dollar you will get back 3 dollars or lets say 5 you get back 10 and so on. lets say you put in the full amount I will triple what you put in add it up. Now WHO IS WITH ME CAN WE DO IT CAN WE MAKE IT. LETS CHANGE THE OLD AND BRING IN THE NEW. </div><div>This new Lighter is not just a new product but a symbol that an average person like my self who has a family. That dreams can come true that there is a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow and we can share that pot. What I mean is for whom ever gets in with this average family man will earn back. It will be paid forward like i said for a dollar you will get 3 for 5 you will get 10 and so on but if you give the full amount I will triple it. To see this come to life would be a dream come true just we got to work together to make it happen. This product already has a record of success through the research put into it like that score of 72 out of 79 and that there is nothing else out there like it. Till we put it out there.</div><div>The main challenge is just ahead and that challenge is time lets say we make it to the amount needed then its just time that is required for the marketing and promoting to take affect. With that companies help it will get done they have all the resources needed to accomplish this goal.

<h3><b>Who We Are and Our Place in the Community</b></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>We are small group of residents of the Beach and surrounding area with a passion for community and local food. Our goal is to create a small communal garden in Ashbridges Bay called the Beach Community Edible Garden, in an effort to cultivate community in the Beaches through growing organic food locally. The project will welcome the Beaches and surrounding area citizens to participate in community gardening that will be interlocked specifically with the Beaches Rec Centre and the Glen Rhodes United Church Food Bank. The large majority of our food grown will go towards the food bank. With the Beaches Rec Centre, the children at the culinary camp will help grow the food in their space in the garden and then will get to eat it in meals they help to cook. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Do you like coconuts but don’t know how to open one? </b>Cococrack  is the clever solution for opening a
coconut easily, quickly and hygienically.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Have you ever tried to open a mature coconut in weird ways?  </b>You have probably used a hammer, a saw, a screwdriver
or maybe you threw it on the ground or hit it against the wall…  Well, this is all very dangerous, hard and
unhygienic!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Cococrack is the innovative solution</b> that allows you to enjoy  a delicious piece of coconut quickly,
without any effort, and without hurting yourself.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Cococrack is made in Italy! </b>This product has
been designed to be efficient and effective and, at the same time, to show the
best in Italian design. It is ergonomic and create using the best techniques
and high quality materials. Cococrack is also easy to wash and keep clean. It's available in three colors: yellow, green and orange. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Cococrack opener</strong> breaks the coconut shell. It’s really easy to use: you just have to insert the Cococrack’s  point in the soft eye of the coconut, that is the softest of the three eyes that you find on the top of the coconut, and then you screw it in like a corkscrew. This surprisingly simple operation easily breaks the coconut shell, lets you drain the coconut water and gets you in to the delicious coconut pulp.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Cococrack cutter</b> is the second tool of the Cococrack set. You need it to easily cut the shell in smaller portions and then romoving the pulp from the shell is incredibly easy. So, in a  few simple steps you can open the coconut and share the pleasure of eating a fresh slice of coconut with family and friends.</p>

</div><p><b>Who I am</b></p><div>
</div><p align=""justify"">I am an Italian entrepreneur and since I was young I have had<span> the passion for innovative and simple inventions that can
help people to deal with all the little difficulties everyday life imposes.
 It has been because of my friends’ and relatives’ enthusiasm which pushed
me to produce my Cococrack. They have been the first to try it and they really
appreciated its practicality. They gave me the confidence I needed to keep on
developing Cococrack.</span></p><div>
</div><p><b>How I got the idea</b></p><div>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I got the idea to creating these two simple kitchen
utensils on a hot summer night while I was struggling to open a coconut to
offer to my friends. I remember I wanted to end dinner by sharing the pleasure
of tasting a good and fresh slice of coconut, but I had trouble trying to open
it; I was sweating heavily! So, I started to think about a way to avoid such a
hard effort. At that moment I realized I had to exploit the weak point of the
coconut: the softer eye. It took me only a few minutes and I came up with this
great invention: a tool that everybody can use to open a ripe coconut in a few
little gestures, effortless and in a hygienic and safe way. </p><div>
</div><p><b><span>Current stage of the project</span></b></p><div>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the last couple of months I managed the different
aspects of the production. I worked on the design and searched for the best
productive technology and the specific materials in order to guarantee a
product easy to wash, reliable and cheap.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1397186/files/20150419150234-Prototipi.jpg?1429480954"" src="""" style=""width: 306px; height: 208px;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431109127/ek7sqygerdvxrzpipgd5.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 270px; height: 201px;""/></p><div>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Then I worked on the logo and the launch of the

coconut easily, quickly and hygienically.
Have you ever tried to open a mature coconut in weird ways?  You have probably used a hammer, a saw, a screwdriver
or maybe you threw it on the ground or hit it against the wall…  Well, this is all very dangerous, hard and
unhygienic!
Cococrack is the innovative solution that allows you to enjoy  a delicious piece of coconut quickly,
without any effort, and without hurting yourself.
Cococrack is made in Italy! This product has
been designed to be efficient and effective and, at the same time, to show the
best in Italian design. It is ergonomic and create using the best techniques
and high quality materials. Cococrack is also easy to wash and keep clean. It's available in three colors: yellow, green and orange. 


 
Cococrack is actually two kitchen tools, specifically designed to open the
hardest fruit in the world!




Cococrack opener breaks the coconut shell. It’s really easy to use: you just have to insert the Cococrack’s  point in the soft eye of the coconut, that is the softest of the three eyes that you find on the top of the coconut, and then you screw it in like a corkscrew. This surprisingly simple operation easily breaks the coconut shell, lets you drain the coconut water and gets you in to the delicious coconut pulp.




Cococrack cutter is the second tool of the Cococrack set. You need it to easily cut the shell in smaller portions and then romoving the pulp from the shell is incredibly easy. So, in a  few simple steps you can open the coconut and share the pleasure of eating a fresh slice of coconut with family and friends.


Before now, when you had to open a mature coconut, you had to use your
imagination to get it open! Let’s have a look at the most common methods compared
to Cococrack.





















Who I am
I am an Italian entrepreneur and since I was young I have had the passion for innovative and simple inventions that can
help people to deal with all the little difficulties everyday life imposes.
 It has been because of my friends’ and relatives’ enthusiasm which pushed
me to produce my Cococrack. They have been the first to try it and they really
appreciated its practicality. They gave me the confidence I needed to keep on
developing Cococrack.
How I got the idea
I got the idea to creating these two simple kitchen
utensils on a hot summer night while I was struggling to open a coconut to
offer to my friends. I remember I wanted to end dinner by sharing the pleasure
of tasting a good and fresh slice of coconut, but I had trouble trying to open
it; I was sweating heavily! So, I started to think about a way to avoid such a
hard effort. At that moment I realized I had to exploit the weak point of the
coconut: the softer eye. It took me only a few minutes and I came up with this
great invention: a tool that everybody can use to open a ripe coconut in a few
little gestures, effortless and in a hygienic and safe way. 
Current stage of the project
In the last couple of months I managed the different
aspects of the production. I worked on the design and searched for the best
productive technology and the specific materials in order to guarantee a
product easy to wash, reliable and cheap.   
Then I worked on the logo and the launch of the
product. Finally, I created specific marketing tools to communicate the product
features most effectively. The final development is the mock-up which includes
a lot of different prototypes, both in metal, aluminum and steel, and different
types of plastics. The final product will be made of plastic suitable for food
use with stainless steel for the point of the screw and the blade of the cutter.
There will be three different colors to choose from: yellow, green and orange.

Providing food education through cooking.
How do you create well-balanced meals with limited time, money, and access to food? At VittleWise, we focus on providing food education and access for those who want to learn how to cook but are limited. We work specifically with those who live in a transitional living period of becoming more self-reliant. Whether transitioning off the streets, out of prison, or from a dorm room, we all need help in learning how to cook healthy meals. 
Our focus is on SROs
Single room occupancy (SRO) units are low-income housing units that are government subsidized for people who struggle with homelessness and poverty. 

Residents of SROs only have a microwave for cooking a donated supply of mostly canned goods from local food banks. With limited cooking knowledge and limited resources, many struggle with malnutrition and much food becomes wasted.
Our solution to help prevent these issues is with the Microwave Meals Cookbook. We researched the commonly donated food items to make 21 meals using a microwave. We are looking to distribute these cookbooks and provide training for residents in SROs.
Microwave Meals educates and informs people how to use cheap, accessible ingredients to create well-balanced meals. Just check out the videos below to see how easy it is to create these meals. 

There are roughly 6,000 SRO units left in Chicago. We want to give each person who lives in these units an easier way to cook healthier meals.

What We Need Here are what your donations go towards:  
Goal 1: Print & distribute 6,000 cookbooks to each SRO unit in Chicago.  
Goal 2: Provide training for cooking and preparing meals in SRO facilities.  








What You Get

Each person that donates will receive a complimentary digital copy of the Microwave Meals cookbook. (view preview sample)

It is her task to fetch water for her entire family to drink, bathe and cook with.

<p><i>You know about Yellow Pages, Yelp, Web, Angie List, and others, expensive directory platforms. You possibly receive calls daily. <b>We will prove to you, that Internet Directories with SEO, reviews, 
links, images and even video inclusion do not have to be that expensive,
 as other make you believe.</b><br/></i></p>
<p><b>Support our expansion to deliver a less costly alternative to deliver Local Directory Listings for Local Business Owners without busting their marketing budget.</b> <br/></p>
<p><b>We added a super perk (limited time) for a funding of $12</b> you will receive a full directory listing for your business category (we will create the category if not yet listed). Even a $5 funding would support our efforts.<br/></p>
<p>Every single month, there are on average 500k brand new businesses starting! These businesses know they MUST get listed on online directories or they will sink very quickly, because 80% of all sales today start with a local search!<br/></p>
<p><i>And YES, I am fed up how business owners get taken</i>. Paying $1,000's for websites and videos, and up to $300 to $500 per month for listings in directories.  The problem is, that some ""Big Name"" companies with Telemarketing groups charge the local business owner horrendous fees, telemarketers calling constantly with up-sells, statements to remove reviews, etc... mostly to pay huge commission and bonuses for the ""headhunters"".</p>
<p></p>
<p>During the last year, myself and two devoted business owners created a concept, to <b>assist EVERY small/medium sized business to get their presence on the Internet.</b> And it makes no difference if they have a website or don't. </p>
<p>We offer three services to local businesses:</p>
<p>1. Directory listing in <b>targeted Mobile Responsive Local Directories</b>: - <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">with complete business details, Google map, images and video placements (regular rate $1 per day)</span></p>
<p>2. Directory listing in <b>targeted Mobile Responsive Local Directories</b>, and creating a custom video for the business: - <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">including business details, phone, email and website embedded into the video. Video will be placed on Youtube and a Video Marketing directory</span></p>
<p>3. <b>Custom Website, mobile responsive, with custom video</b>, directory listing, SEO, hosting, domain, updates in an ""All-in-One"" pack for a low monthly rental rate at $45 with a 1-time set-up fee.</p>
<p>All our services are based on quarterly or yearly rates. Full transparency, No Hidden charges or up-sells.  I dislike them also.</p>
<p>Our Directories are localized in Country, States, and Cities domain and websites, under our <b>Brand Name: YelloDirect</b></p>

<div>We will personally contact you to make sure we deliver what we promise. </div> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.<b> Can we count you in?</b></p></div>","Summary I am fed up how small and medium sized business owners get taken. 
You know about Yellow Pages, Yelp, Web, Angie List, and others, expensive directory platforms. You possibly receive calls daily. We will prove to you, that Internet Directories with SEO, reviews, 
links, images and even video inclusion do not have to be that expensive,
 as other make you believe.
Support our expansion to deliver a less costly alternative to deliver Local Directory Listings for Local Business Owners without busting their marketing budget. 
We added a super perk (limited time) for a funding of $12 you will receive a full directory listing for your business category (we will create the category if not yet listed). Even a $5 funding would support our efforts.
Every single month, there are on average 500k brand new businesses starting! These businesses know they MUST get listed on online directories or they will sink very quickly, because 80% of all sales today start with a local search!
And YES, I am fed up how business owners get taken. Paying $1,000's for websites and videos, and up to $300 to $500 per month for listings in directories.  The problem is, that some ""Big Name"" companies with Telemarketing groups charge the local business owner horrendous fees, telemarketers calling constantly with up-sells, statements to remove reviews, etc... mostly to pay huge commission and bonuses for the ""headhunters"".

During the last year, myself and two devoted business owners created a concept, to assist EVERY small/medium sized business to get their presence on the Internet. And it makes no difference if they have a website or don't. 
We offer three services to local businesses:
1. Directory listing in targeted Mobile Responsive Local Directories: - with complete business details, Google map, images and video placements (regular rate $1 per day)
2. Directory listing in targeted Mobile Responsive Local Directories, and creating a custom video for the business: - including business details, phone, email and website embedded into the video. Video will be placed on Youtube and a Video Marketing directory
3. Custom Website, mobile responsive, with custom video, directory listing, SEO, hosting, domain, updates in an ""All-in-One"" pack for a low monthly rental rate at $45 with a 1-time set-up fee.
All our services are based on quarterly or yearly rates. Full transparency, No Hidden charges or up-sells.  I dislike them also.
Our Directories are localized in Country, States, and Cities domain and websites, under our Brand Name: YelloDirect
We are preparing specific niche categories to give business even further exposure, like Restaurants and several other niche categories. 
All our Directories and Custom Websites are Mobile Responsive. Since Google changed how the analyze mobile responsive websites versus non-mobile sites, this has become a major impact how websites are found. 65%+ searches are done using mobile devices. 
   What We Need & What You Get Funds will be used to create added Local Directories. Each Directory has its own domain and fully functional Directory website. We will expand several more niche category directories (sorry - trade secret).  We maintain several hosting servers in different locations in U.S and Europe, and plan to activate two more servers in a short term. Our inventory of prepared videos for niches counts several hundreds and we will have the need to cover a few more selected niches.

Today, I’m a victim."" -Adisa Bašić, Bosnian poet  Last year, catastrophic flooding and heavy rains destroyed the weaving center of The Association of Bosnian Family (BOSFAM), which has been a safe place for war-affected Bosnian women to come and earn an income for two decades. With your support, we can rebuild.


The WeaversMeet Zifa, born in 1952 in a small Bosnian village who learned to weave beautiful Bosnian carpets (ćilimi) when she was just seven years old. Zifa became a wife and mother of two and lived a pleasant life until the attack on Srebrenica in 1995, when her family was separated and she fled to Tuzla with her daughter and young grandson.As a refugee waiting in agony for the return of her husband, son, and son-in-law, Zifa wanted to earn an income to support her family and found BOSFAM, where she could continue doing what she was so good at: weaving. Not only did she earn money from her hard work, but she met other women in similarly devastating situations with whom she could relate and go to for emotional support.Zifa was reunited with her husband in Tuzla where they waited for over a decade for their son. In 2007, Zifa's son, only in his twenties during the massacre, was identified and buried in Potočari as one of the over 8,000 victims of genocide. During the summer of 2015, twenty years after the fall of Srebrenica, her son-in-law was identified and laid to rest.Zifa still works at BOSFAM as hard as ever, making large, intricate carpets to support her family, including her grandson's education. Despite seemingly never-ending tragedy, Zifa is often smiling and can be found at a BOSFAM loom in Tuzla nearly every day of the week, hard at work.Unfortunately, the current condition of BOSFAM's workshop make it difficult for BOSFAM to accommodate more than three or four weavers at a time and Zifa's income, as well as that of the rest of the women of BOSFAM, is at risk of disappearing altogether.The ProjectLast year, the Balkans received a month's worth of rain in a matter of days, leading to the worst flooding in 120 years, the destruction of countless buildings, and the deaths of at least 40 people. The heavy rainfall destroyed BOSFAM's main workshop in Tuzla and has left hard-working women without a way to earn an income. At its peak, BOSFAM had a network of 300-400 women, supporting 25-30 in its workshop each day. Now, only 3-4 women can come to weave and the network of women is waiting to return. Without the workshop, BOSFAM’s very existence hangs in the balance.We need to raise $10,000 to get our workshop back in operation before winter so BOSFAM can continue to function at full capacity. Here's how it breaks down:

$6,200 to construct two roofs over exposed areas of the workshop to prevent future water damage. You can view the details in our official estimate from a local contractor.


$1,300 to finish interior cosmetic repairs from water damage, including painting.


$1,500 for the costs of handicraft production.


$1,000 to cover our fundraising costs, including Indiegogo fees and payment processing.

<p><b><u>So what is Warriors Without Weapons?</u><i><u><br/></u></i></b></p>
<p><a href=""http://warriorswithoutweapons.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Warriors Without Weapons</a> is a 32-day <b>international community and
social entrepreneurship training program</b> offered to youth, who want to change the world NOW. <br/></p>
<p>The program offers a number of tools that facilitate collective decision-making and implementation of projects in communities in a challenging cultural and social environment. <br/></p>
<p><b>60 young ""warriors"" </b>from over <b>15 different countries </b>come together and <b>realise a collective dream with 3 underprivileged communities in Santos, Brazil</b>!<br/></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>Ok, you got my attention. How does it work?</u></b></p>
<p><b>Where others see scarcity, we see abundance! </b>Using a methodology that teaches that every community is rich with resources (that when recognised encourage self-reliance
and build confidence) the participants work hand in hand with the community to plan, design and materialise tangible things like parks, cultural
centres or playgrounds; so tires are turned into swings and concrete blocks in to plant pots.<br/></p>
<p> And this methodology emphasises that we can <span>do
it in a </span><strong><span>collective, pleasurable and fun way!</span></strong> <br/></p>

<br/><p><b><u>And what happens after the 32 days?</u></b></p>
<p>This is the best bit. Warriors Without Weapons is about materializing collective
dreams, and actively changing people's lives, <b>everywhere</b>. Throughout the 32 day
training period, participants are provided with the tools needed to transform
lives anywhere in the world and within any community that faces daily struggles
and social injustices. <b>It starts local and goes global.</b></p>

<br/>
<p><b><u>What about the participants’ own country? What about

<p><b><u>Costs</u></b>
</p>
<p><b><u>Program fee:</u> </b>The total cost for each warrior is
R$12,000 (Brazilian real) and Instituto Elos covers half of this amount through
fundraising and partnerships. The other half is the responsibility of each
participant. That means, they rely on me to pay R$6,000, which
corresponds to approximately €1,750. This fee includes the
program’s running cost, accommodation, meals, and transportation in Santos<b>.</b></p>

</p>I believe in positive change. And I believe in community. And when we
combine positive action, with an empowered community, miracles can happen and
dreams are constructed. <b>What are the chances of
making the world a better place, a fairer place and a place we all want to live
in? </b>With Warriors Without Weapons the chances are tipped in favor of collective
positive change. Bringing this
methodology back to Greece (at a time when it needs it the most), and the
UK (who can pioneer such changes), is an invaluable opportunity, for both communities, and something I am passionate and excited about.<br/><br/><p>

60 young ""warriors"" from over 15 different countries come together and realise a collective dream with 3 underprivileged communities in Santos, Brazil!


Ok, you got my attention. How does it work?
Where others see scarcity, we see abundance! Using a methodology that teaches that every community is rich with resources (that when recognised encourage self-reliance
and build confidence) the participants work hand in hand with the community to plan, design and materialise tangible things like parks, cultural
centres or playgrounds; so tires are turned into swings and concrete blocks in to plant pots.
 And this methodology emphasises that we can do
it in a collective, pleasurable and fun way! 




And what happens after the 32 days?
This is the best bit. Warriors Without Weapons is about materializing collective
dreams, and actively changing people's lives, everywhere. Throughout the 32 day
training period, participants are provided with the tools needed to transform
lives anywhere in the world and within any community that faces daily struggles
and social injustices. It starts local and goes global.



What about the participants’ own country? What about
Greece?
When participants
return to their country of residence, through an ongoing mentorship, they are actively
encouraged to implement what they learned, in to their daily lives and help
transform their community.  


Who runs the program?

Costs

Program fee: The total cost for each warrior is
R$12,000 (Brazilian real) and Instituto Elos covers half of this amount through
fundraising and partnerships. The other half is the responsibility of each
participant. That means, they rely on me to pay R$6,000, which
corresponds to approximately €1,750. This fee includes the
program’s running cost, accommodation, meals, and transportation in Santos.
Total: €1,984 (this also includes the indiegogo fee + currency rate)
Why do I want to go? 

I believe in positive change. And I believe in community. And when we
combine positive action, with an empowered community, miracles can happen and
dreams are constructed. What are the chances of
making the world a better place, a fairer place and a place we all want to live
in? With Warriors Without Weapons the chances are tipped in favor of collective
positive change. Bringing this
methodology back to Greece (at a time when it needs it the most), and the
UK (who can pioneer such changes), is an invaluable opportunity, for both communities, and something I am passionate and excited about.
What can I do for you?  
Firstly, you have my deepest gratitude and eternal thanks!! Your support and generosity is not only helping 3 underprivileged communities in Brazil, it is also helping a young doer build the world we dream of right now. Wait!! There's more!! I've also created a set of fun perks for you to enjoy and to remember that you didn't just change this gal's life but the lives of whole communities in Brazil. PLUS the perks will include ridiculous facial expressions, awful dancing and general all round goofiness. Because who doesn't like laughing at their friend looking all silly and stuff??
Other ways you can helpThank you for making it to the end of the campaign page! If you believe in this project as much as I do, you can help me spread the word and make some noise - please share my campaign link to all the dreamers, creators and doers you know! The time to change the world is now and, together, we can. THANK YOU! SHUKRAN! ΕΥΧΑΡΙΣΤΩ! OBRIGADA!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our goal is to prepare Veterans for employment opportunities
in Security Services by providing the necessary training, certifications and
assistance to begin a new career. The funds raised through this program will be
used to provide the state mandated training to qualify Veterans for the Florida
Unarmed Security Guard license.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the 40 hour curriculum, GPPS will assist
the Veteran in completing the Florida State application and guide them through
the licensing process. In addition, GPPS will pay all fees charged by the State
for application processing, finger printing and background checks enabling the
Veteran to obtain this license at no personal cost.</p>
<p>Once the Veteran is licensed to work as a Security
Professional, GPPS will provide a Veteran’s Preference for all positions within
our company and will provide ongoing career guidance and placement assistance
at no cost to the Veteran.</p>
<p>Our mission is to serve those who served. Whether they
served on the front lines in combat or in a support role in some remote corner
of the world, our Veterans have all made significant sacrifices so that we can enjoy
our everyday freedoms. Returning to civilian occupations and earning a
sustainable income can be a difficult challenge for these individuals and we
need your help to assist these heroes. </p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Even a small donation can help us
change the life of a Veteran. The cost of training, support and licensing will
be $350 for each Veteran. The funding goal of this program is designed to help
a minimum of 50 Veterans but combining even the smallest contribution with
those of other grateful participants can help us repay these brave men and
women for their service.</p>
<p>Training can begin as each $350
plateau is reached. This can have an immediate effect on our Veterans and their
families by providing an industry recognized credential and opening doors for
employment.</p>
<p>The Security Field is a growth
industry offering opportunities not only for employment but for career growth. At
GPPS we are Veterans and ex-Law Enforcement professionals who recognize and
value the service of our military. Our program is designed to provide the
training and skills employers are currently seeking based on real world
experience. In addition, GPPS will provide ongoing career guidance at no cost
to the Veteran and will offer opportunities to attain additional certifications
to help them advance.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The Security Field is not for
everyone. It requires a unique blend of knowledge, skills and commitment. Our
Veterans have demonstrated the courage and personal attributes essential to
succeed in this challenging profession and our program is designed to provide
the necessary knowledge and skills to enter this field. </p>
<p>Since these services are provided
one Veteran at a time, failure to reach our full funding objective will slow our
success but will not stop us from helping Veterans. Each $350 increment means
we can help a Veteran and his or her family. </p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Our primary goal is to raise funds
through financial contributions. However, sharing this program with your personal
and professional network will enable us to reach more like minded individuals
and possibly expand this program to impact even more lives. Sustainable
employment is the greatest challenge facing our Veterans as they transition back
to civilian life. Our goal is to provide Vets with the training and support necessary
to gain meaningful employment and create a career. </p>
<p>We appreciate any help or support
you can provide.</p>

<p></p><p><b>The
Inaugural Pumpkin Mash Dash</b></p>
<p>Keep Colleyville Beautiful (<a href=""http://www.keepcolleyvillebeautiful.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.keepcolleyvillebeautiful.com/</a>) is a community based non-profit
organization focused on bettering the lives of Colleyville residents.
Colleyville’s current recycling program is a reflection of KCB members’
efforts. Additionally, KCB administers Colleyville’s Adopt-A-Street program and
participates in the annual city wide Clean Sweep event. KCB would like to
expand its efforts to include such things as a community garden and more community
events. To help achieve this goal KCB has decided to start a new tradition in
Colleyville, with the inaugural <b>Pumpkin Mash Dash on November 7<sup>th</sup>,
2015 at the Pleasant Run Soccer Complex, 6700 Pleasant Run, Colleyville, Texas</b>.</p>
<p>The Pumpkin Mash Dash will be an annual
late-afternoon fun run/walk and timed 5K/10K race along the beautiful Cotton
Belt Trail in Colleyville, Texas. Additionally, after the race there will be a
community Lighted Bicycle Parade for all ages. The hope is that this event will
help raise money for KCB, raise community awareness of KCB, and be a chance for
people to come together and enjoy Colleyville’s portion of the Cotton Belt
Trail with a run and a unique parade. At the event KCB also hopes to educate the
public on recycling, litter control, beautification, the environment and
health.</p>
<p><b>Why
Indiegogo for fundraising? </b></p>
<p>Through Indiegogo as a non-profit, all donations will
be tax deductible. Additionally, by having our fundraising effort on Indiegogo,
supporters can pay by credit card. We can also reach a large group of supporters
we may not even know. KCB is a volunteer, non-profit organization which only
receives funding from grants and donations. A race has lots of expenses, and we
expect the Pumpkin Mash Dash at a minimum to cost $4000 at a minimum to put on. This will
drain a large portion of our limited funding. With 300-400 runners and their associated
registration fees, the Pumpkin Mash Dash is expected to just break even. Since
this is the first time KCB has put on such an event there is a great unknown
around how many participants there will be and a chance for unplanned expenses.
We have teamed with a great race organizer, PlayTri, who has donated their
skills and expertise to help us put on the Pumpkin Mash Dash. We have also
consulted with other non-profit groups who put on races. We feel prepared, but
there still are risks. By raising funds through Indiegogo, these risks can be
offset and more of the registration fees can be used by KCB for its efforts.
All the funds raised here will go directly to putting on the Pumpkin Mash Dash
and Lighted Bicycle Parade. If we exceed our goals, those proceeds will go to
making the race and parade even better next year.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The biggest risk and challenge is
Keep Colleyville Beautiful has never done an event like this before. Even with
the help we are receiving from PlayTri and other non-profits, something could
happen we haven’t planned for. </p>
<p><b>Where can I register for the race? </b></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.playtri.com/pumpkinmashdash"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.playtri.com/pumpkinmashdash</a></p>
<p><b>What is a Lighted Bicycle Parade?</b></p>
<p>The Lighted
Bicycle Parade is a community event where participants will ride
their bicycles on a short course around the Colleyville Pleasant Run Soccer
Complex. At a minimum bicycles will need headlights, but riders are encouraged
to decorate their bicycles as brightly and colorfully as they can. Registration
for the parade is free and open to all ages who can operate a bike by
headlight, at dusk, at slow speeds, safely. Bike-pulled trailers will be allowed
as long as they are securely attached to the bicycle and have a breakaway
cable/device. Open flames and throwing items from bicycles such as candy isprohibited due to insurance reasons.</p>

<p><b>What happens if you don’t meet your fundraising goal? </b></p>
<p>The race and
parade will still go on. Every dollar we raise will help us, but if we come up
short in fundraising, it will make it extremely difficult to do all the things
KCB currently does and would like to do in the future.</p>
<p><b>Can the race be cancelled? </b></p>
<p>The race
would only be cancelled due to extreme weather or other catastrophe. A
cancelled race will not be rescheduled. Registration for runners is
non-refundable. Runners will still get a race shirt, and Indiegogo supporters
will get their rewards. “Get A Booth” supporters will get refunds if they
desire. If you have further questions please contact this campaign’s organizer
before donating. </p>
<p><b>I have a question I can’t find an answer for? </b></p>
<p>Please
contact the campaign organizer with any questions. We’ll as quickly as possible
address your question because… we are sure others have the same question.</p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>There are many ways other than
donating where you can help. A race and parade like this need lots of
volunteers before, during, after and the day after the event. If you are
interested, please contact this campaign’s organizer. Additionally, please tell
everyone you know to register for the race or donate. The more people who hear
about the Pumpkin Mash Dash and this fundraising campaign, the more likely Keep
Colleyville Beautiful is to have a successful race and meet our fundraising
goal.</p>

<p><b>Mission Statement</b></p>
<p>To create distinguished, exciting and innovative knit products for everyone.</p>
<p><b>Scott Ian McFarland Knitwear Story</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Scott Ian McFarland Knitwear is a
knitwear manufacturing company that I opened a little over a year ago. As a
fashion designer with my own line, I saw a huge need for a knitwear
manufacturing company that would work with starting designers with no minimum order.
That is how Scott Ian McFarland Knitwear came to be. We will work with anyone
that wants to make a knit product from a blanket to a jacket and everything in
between.</p>
<p>After being in business for over a
year, we have come to a point where need to expand and purchase more equipment
to help meet the needs of our customers. </p>
<p>We are growing and we need help bringing
dreams from paper to reality.  By expanding we will help our local
community by being able to employ more people. We will help communities all over
the country by creating knit products from designers in those communities. </p>
<br/>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are asking for 15k. This money
will go to several things. First part will be used to secure a second machine
and double our capacity to create great knitwear for you. This money will
help us hire and train more people to make our great knits.</p>
<p>15k</p>
<p>11k down payment on second machine</p>
<p>4k first months pay for employees while they are training to create great knits!</p>
<p>With your contribution you will help
us grow. You will be able to select some great perks like sweaters,
blankets, or even design your own custom knit blanket. All perks are
limited addition as well so you are not only getting a great knit product made
in NC but also a unique one.</p>
<p>The great thing with Indiegogo is it
is not an all or nothing funding site. What we raise together will fund us
and allow us to provide you the great products in the perks.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The impact will be felt instantly.
Once the Indiegogo campaign ends we will begin our expansion. This will include the
purchase of more equipment and the hiring of more help. This will make a real
difference here in the Conover/Hickory North Carolina area by providing good
jobs. It may help your local community as well. Many of the designers that
we work with are all over the county. For example one of our clients Matter.com, that we make great knit blankets for, is based in New Orleans. Some of the
proceeds of every blanket purchased go to the <b>Sandy relief fund</b>. See lots of impacts from a small knit factory in
Conover North Carolina: with one-product three communities are impacted. </p>

<br/><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With any small business there are risks and challenges. Over the last year and half we have weathered a few. Such as lack of work, machine failures and lack of trained help. And let's not
forget that manufacturing any products in the USA can be more expensive which
turns some business away. </p>
<p>As someone that has both a design and
manufacturing background and been surviving for over year in business I am confident
that all the challenges we have experienced are being overcome as we grow and
get better at what we do.</p>
<p>I see these as opportunities. We are
getting more work and getting our name out to more people. This campaign will
help with that. You can also help by spreading the word about
what we are up to.  I feel passionately
about having the products I chose to use and buy being made here in the USA. I
always find it really cool to meet people that had a hand in creating what we
use every day. By having products  made in the USA the carbon footprint is
smaller since the product has less distance to travel before it is in your hands.  Producing things here also helps the local community that we call home by stimulating the local economy.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Please pass our information on to
everyone you know. They may need a great sweater, scarf or blanket.  Let everyone know about us. There is a lot of
talk these days about American manufacturing coming back and we are part of
that. We are making great things here everyday and would love for more people
to enjoy them.</p>

Scott Ian McFarland Knitwear Story


Scott Ian McFarland Knitwear is a
knitwear manufacturing company that I opened a little over a year ago. As a
fashion designer with my own line, I saw a huge need for a knitwear
manufacturing company that would work with starting designers with no minimum order.
That is how Scott Ian McFarland Knitwear came to be. We will work with anyone
that wants to make a knit product from a blanket to a jacket and everything in
between.
After being in business for over a
year, we have come to a point where need to expand and purchase more equipment
to help meet the needs of our customers. 
We are growing and we need help bringing
dreams from paper to reality.  By expanding we will help our local
community by being able to employ more people. We will help communities all over
the country by creating knit products from designers in those communities. 

What We Need & What You Get


We are asking for 15k. This money
will go to several things. First part will be used to secure a second machine
and double our capacity to create great knitwear for you. This money will
help us hire and train more people to make our great knits.

us grow. You will be able to select some great perks like sweaters,
blankets, or even design your own custom knit blanket. All perks are

<p>My name is David LiCause and I am the founder of Broke Compass. Last Fall I joined a college buddy of mine on a bicycle trip across America. We spent a little over three months on the road, riding through incredible places and meeting amazing people along the way. My friend and I loved being tourists in new and unfamiliar places, and connecting with other travelers that could share these experiences with us. But we found that there was a gap between discovering new places, and connecting with other travelers. There was not a resource that helped to facilitate that connection with other travelers, while we were already away from home. </p>

What is Broke Compass?


Broke Compass is an app that fills the gap between experiencing new places, and connecting with other travelers. Users navigate through an interactive map that displays events that other travelers have created. 


Once users find an activity they’re interested in, they join that event, and meet up with a group of fellow travelers and experience a tourist activity together. Whether that activity is taking a tour of an art museum, going on a hike, or simply checking out a cool restaurant, users bond with one another organically, over the shared experience of the group activity and the mutual interest in travel.

<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>This is an emergency! We have already gathered a large team of 
volunteers in Greece working on launching the new EURO DRACHMA currency for the Greek people and by the Greek people and we need your support.<br/></p>
<p>Banks and governments in Greece and in many highly indebted countries are failing or will fail. Greece is a showcase in which banks and technocrats are trying to apply the same old failed methods to solve debt and financial problems that they themselves created and are unable to solve. Letting them continue like that is madness.

</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> <li>This campaign is important for me, you and us because the current constant growth to pay for the interest on our debts is creating the need for ever greater taxes and is depleting our energy and the earth's resources. It is a modern type slavery trend which moves all the richness and values from those that produce to those that control the flow of money. This has to <b>change</b> and it has to change <b>now</b>. We need you for that now!</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<ul> <li>You will help to develop a new economy and society by the people and for the people. Let's put the individual back at the center of society. It will make any citizen sovereign and will help create development which is much more needed than the unnecessary financial growth needed to repay unnecessary debt. </li> </ul> <p>Make a contribution. It can be of any size small or large, show us that you care. Tomorrow <b>the same can happen in your city or country</b> as well. Whatever you can and whatever you give helps. <span><br/></span></p>

</div><div> <p>Why we need you and why the time is right now:</p> <ul> <li>We are asking for USD 11,000,000 - Is that a lot? Yes, it is a big amount. But bear in mind that there are 11 millions citizens in Greece. Playing on the economies of scale, this amount will enable us to help the Greeks to provide each Greek citizen young and old with a new Euro Drachma account he or she can start using immediately with their phones, cards and PC's to buy basic things creating a circular local economy and exchange.</li>
<li>We are raising USD and not EURO because in the Indiegogo system, only USD can be accepted for credit cards we will convert the currency as needed. </li>
<li>Local circular economy and the EURO DRACHMA currency help keep the richness and added value created by the working people locally in the country where it is most needed. </li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We need this money to</span><b style=""background-color: initial;""> reach each and every village</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, each and every person and business, teach them how to use the new complementary system and continue developing it. We have already translated our App's into Greek and we are launching already a much upgraded Greek speaking app with many various other solutions needed by the people running on all major smartphones platforms (iPhones, Androids, BlackBerry and Windows Phones), older phones as well as tools that even an 80 year old can understand and use. </span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Our team members and 
volunteers in Greece are already interacting with many common citizens, merchants, stakeholders, NGOs, municipalities, journalists... and all have shown interest and are excited by this project. Our team of volunteers grows very quickly. <span><br/></span>

Also, the Open Source thousands of servers world wide need to approuve each and every transaction and this can take up to 12 minutes. Totally unusable in a supermarket where people are cuing to pay for their purchases. BitCoins did not help apart from many techies any community to this day. PayServices is using a different approach, enabling real time immediate transfer of value while working with <b>local communities</b>, municipalities and tribes to provide them with self governing tools to make them sovereign and this includes their own currencies and tools to manage it themselves for themselves.

<b>The impact will be huge</b> because the current financial system is totally inefficient and adds a huge burden on working men and women.

</p><p><b>What do I want to create ?</b><br/>I would like to establish a company
which is going to take care of the basic human needs such as housing, food,
water, electricity, internet, house plants, basic furniture, clothes and also
computers(educational purposes) at non profit.</p><p><b>How would we run non-profit?</b><br/>Through the initial donation we
would get plenty to start and build up plenty that will help people's life
straight away and once the system has been completed to ""provide""
housings we will start to make an attempt to „purchase” houses away from the
current owners who (to sustain themselves in our <u>current</u> economy) are
currently running it for a <b><a href=""http://www.mintpressnews.com/empty-homes-outnumber-the-homeless-6-to-1-so-why-not-give-them-homes/207194/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">profit </a></b>and once enough progress has been made we
will look to implement the next steps such as making <b><a href=""https://www.quora.com/How-much-electricity-does-Manoj-Bhargavas-Free-Electric-hybrid-bike-generate-And-would-an-electricity-generating-gym-be-a-viable-business"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">electricity</a></b>, <b><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1yhont/how_much_does_it_actually_cost_isps_to_provide/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">internet</a></b>,
<b><a href=""http://www.cancertutor.com/ozoneair/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">water</a></b>, <b><a href=""http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/antiinflammation-diet-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>food</span></a></b>, <b><a href=""http://lifehacker.com/this-graphic-shows-the-best-air-cleaning-plants-accord-1705307836"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">house plants</a></b>, etc...
steadily available for everyone (<u>worldwide</u>).

</p><p>At the same time we will when the
donations are sufficient to increase our „ownership” of houses use our then
gained position in our world to provide loans at non-profit and make it
voluntarily to pay more or if you move at an earlier moment away from the flat
that you wanted to get through our support receive the option to get a new
apartment and we will keep the old flat and make it available for someone new.</p>
<p>And eventually empty houses will
become available for services similar to <b><a href=""http://www.hotelnewsnow.com/Article/16886/Hoteliers-will-lose-the-Airbnb-war"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AirBNB</a></b> until someone needs it for
<b><a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/developments/2015/03/30/airbnb-pushes-up-apartment-rents-slightly-study-says/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">living </a></b>(donate as much as you want and sleep free model). </p>
<p><b>What else would I use this money for
?</b><br/>The money would also be used to
index our current global-social system so that these processes become easier to
understand by common people (such as myself) and also help the government in
providing this service for which we pay our taxes. 

</p><p>The result of this application would
be that you can manage the work that you perform (including job hunting) and when the situation becomes
applicable you can forward all the needed details to the needed location so that you no longer have to deal with the following situation:<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450912695/tckvmtpmiojxwwahizkc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 240.658px; height: 155px;""/><br/></p>
<p>The same I want to do with when you
need housing that your request will be forwarded by you to to the organization
in your area (until we have our own properties available and are stabilized). <br/></p><p><b>Will there be more to this system then what I have mentioned so far?</b><br/>Yes. At the same time we will index the
things that come to matter when moving for a job such as acquiring a passport,
visa, work, relocation, welfare and where possible make this part of the system
so that with a click of a button the needed information is provided to the agency's responsible for dealing with these things.  <br/><br/>This will become one of the main priorities in order to have as quick as possible a
better product on the market then we currently have for the things previously mentioned (in the above part).

<br/></p><p>Besides this we will also attempt to
index all current jobs and future jobs(for job seekers) and give the
option to the <b>people </b>to rank their own job as essential, automatable (such as
plenty of finance jobs, administration jobs, etc) so that we become aware which
jobs can be performed <b><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34066941"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">automated </a></b>by systems or perhaps as useless and we will (without revealing the source) promote that
these jobs  will be (partly) scrapped from the job market. <b><br/></b></p><p><b>Is there a special reason for doing this all?</b><br/>The reason why we
will do this is that it is <b>essential information to know if a new economy can be created based on my ideals</b> but also to keep a live counter on our future website which shows
the number of all the jobs currently being performed by people and calculate
how this adds up compared to the amount of people able to work and add a
different counter of how many jobs are not essential in order to convince
people that we have more people then jobs and that being „unemployed” is
unavoidable.</p><p>And perhaps most important we will take in calculation the amount of 
people who died from murder, suicide and war crimes to showcase that if 
we continue our current path that it increases the earliest opportunity 
to retire (at an earlier age).<br/></p>
<p><b>What is the (expected) main goal of
doing all of this?</b><br/>I hope that once everyone has equality
that world peace can exist and that as an added benefit that all of us can
experience a much shorter working life in this system and I hope that we can
manage things within a period from 10 up-to 15 years which can be calculated
for achievability after we have the numbers of total jobs/humans on this planet
so that afterwards people will be more willing to support our cause and allow
us build a new system and replace our current system; in which we most likely
need to work until we are 70 (in order to make the system work in the first
place). 

</p><p>If it is achievable then it is my
opinion that we should have a mandatory work period that starts at the age of
25 and lasts until you are 35 or 40 while having the option to work before hand
as well in order to give you a chance to get a reduction in the years to work
later on when it is „<i>mandatory</i>” and also having the option to work afterwards
so that other people who are less comfortable with working this long can
receive a reduction in the years to work. </p>
<p>Depending on the outcome I hope that
people will decide that they will work non-profit and that people only perform
essential tasks for <u>being able to live</u> such as transportation, reparation, house building, farming, etc and that <u>what people decide
as essential</u> and have the option to work in this area for some years and
afterwards retire when you choose to do so. <br/></p>
<p>The currency which becomes logical
to use when everyone works non-profit is simply ""the work period in life
or
<u>better said</u>: the average age at which people go on pension"" but it could
fairly well be something else and should trigger an effect that people will value life of other human beings more as each death means that the age of retirement would increase (""If everyone helps with a large task, it will get done <em>easily</em> and <em>quickly</em>"").  <br/></p>
<p><b>Why I want to do this?</b><br/>The reason why I want to do this is
because we live in a world where the basic human needs are not available for
everyone and these people need to struggle to make the end of the month, which
is something that forces these people to focus on the „now” and less on the
„future” while on the same hand they cannot function as they want because they
might need to save expenses by eating less which has an impact on their focus
and these people also have <b><a href=""http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/109074/chapters/How-Poverty-Affects-Behavior-and-Academic-Performance.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">children </a></b>who might be affected in a similar way
causing them to under-perform in school which has an entire different range of
problems attached to it as well such as illnesses like <b><a href=""http://chriskresser.com/is-depression-a-disease-or-a-symptom-of-inflammation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">depression </a></b>and <b><a href=""http://www.canceractive.com/cancer-active-page-link.aspx?n=3054"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>cancer </span></a></b>(which could had been prevented if they
had a proper diet or the lack of stress from making it until the end of the
month). 

</p><b>Another reason </b>is that I do not believe that there are enough (essential)
jobs to go around and that we should accept this fact and not judge people who
are not working (with other words receiving social-benefits) for three reasons;

<p>1.  The system is failing and
this is why we have the system of social care in the first place place</p>
<p>2.  if you pressure people in
pushing them to find works you are in some cases pushing them to provide a
service (such as giving massage, sex, cook for others*, clean for others*,
creating gossip newspapers, gambling joints,  etc) of which some jobs
should not exist unless people who do the jobs say that the work is essential
if not then to expect these type of services is in a sense a slavery enforced
by social pressure and the economical system all in order to sustain yourself
in the current economy in which we treat each other cheaply and very much like
a product instead of as humans all in order to feed an economy which
has never provided all the basic needs such as housing, food, water, etc
to everyone and which I believe with some very simple changes could exist <b><i>if
there would be a support group</i></b>.</p><p><i>* I am NOT against supporting people in this who truly need it such as the elderly, disabled and the ill.</i><br/></p><p>3. The need for profit drives a market to achieve maximum profit without thinking about factors such as<b> <a href=""http://www.hempcar.org/ford.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">efficiency</a>,</b> man-hours, durability, <b><a href=""http://www.greenbiz.com/sites/default/files/inline/computers-large.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">resources</a></b> and the actual cost versus profit.. to further maximize they use differences in law's such as minimal wage and also currency differences, which means you hire with intent someone cheaper and while it is good for that local economy the hidden message is ""<b>you are not equal</b>"" and still the need for money drives people to accept these jobs even if it drives them to <b><a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2103798/Revealed-Inside-Apples-Chinese-sweatshop-factory-workers-paid-just-1-12-hour.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">suicide</a></b>. <b><br/></b></p><p><b>More reasons:</b><br/>Instead of
complaining about politicians I believe that the people who say they do good
are failing in their tasks as the problems are difficult to solve in our
current system and that's why I want to take steps away from the <u>standard</u>
business concept. Then there is also the fact that instead of
 complaining I would rather step up and make an attempt to change things
 because if you complain then you need to have the courage to also step 
up. </p><p></p><p><b>What personal reasons do I have for
doing this?</b><br/>It is because I come from a family
in which i experienced a wide range of issues such as child abuse, second hand
smoking, being abandoned by my own mother, living in an orphanage, having a
father who is addicted to alcohol and cigarettes, having been placed back by my own government
with this man who also was at one point addicted to gambling (in which I have
been told he made plenty of dept), one of my parents emptied my
savings-account(it is unknown whom as the resources to find out outweigh the
benefits), having had a sex-changed „stepmother” who was prevented by my own
government from having contact with me after I was placed back with my father
and <b>unfortunately </b>much more to strongly wish for change in this world as these
things exists and are possible because people NEED to be selfish in order to
survive in our economy or are sanctioned to do wrong after they already ensured their <a href=""http://www.quicksprout.com/2011/03/16/how-much-money-do-you-really-need/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">survival </a>long after they have come to pass away.<br/></p><p></p><p>
</p><b>Why do I not enter politics to create this?</b><br/>Regulations have shown me that doing things within politics takes up a lot of time and if people donate it is a clear proof that the majority of the world wants a change as I propose and wish to create. <b><br/>Will I (once) enter politics? </b><br/>I think that once things are ready and I notice that there is a support group then I have every intention to make a change; by entering the upcoming elections in 2017 or 2021 in my home country (<b>Netherlands)</b>.<b><br/><br/>Why do I ask for 7 billion euro?</b><br/><p>(This number has somewhat of a
meaning and is why I did not go for a smaller amount such as for example €- 250.000
– because I think that the number can become a message and represent
something, for example 

</p><p>- 
It can represent a signal to the world
that people do not want war and have a rough % estimate of people who do not
want <b>ANY </b>war or conflict at all in this world. </p><p>-
It can also be a <b>social experiment: </b>not everyone on our planet 
can donate €- 1 so if we do not achieve the main target then this means 
either that people have no faith in my project, no credit card, no internet or perhaps even that the system of the
 very rich contributing to the poor is not working as well as we would hope it might.</p><p><i>To track this I have created a perk
inside <b>indiegogo </b>which you activate when you donate 1 euro and is one
that we expect to achieve automatically once everyone in the world has every
basic human need (for this reason I ask anyone that reads this to share this
page with their friends and acquaintances).</i></p><span></span></div>","What do I want to create ?I would like to establish a company

The need for profit drives a market to achieve maximum profit without thinking about factors such as efficiency, man-hours, durability, resources and the actual cost versus profit.. to further maximize they use differences in law's such as minimal wage and also currency differences, which means you hire with intent someone cheaper and while it is good for that local economy the hidden message is ""you are not equal"" and still the need for money drives people to accept these jobs even if it drives them to suicide. More reasons:Instead of
complaining about politicians I believe that the people who say they do good
are failing in their tasks as the problems are difficult to solve in our
current system and that's why I want to take steps away from the standard
business concept. Then there is also the fact that instead of
 complaining I would rather step up and make an attempt to change things
 because if you complain then you need to have the courage to also step 
up. What personal reasons do I have for
doing this?It is because I come from a family
in which i experienced a wide range of issues such as child abuse, second hand
smoking, being abandoned by my own mother, living in an orphanage, having a
father who is addicted to alcohol and cigarettes, having been placed back by my own government
with this man who also was at one point addicted to gambling (in which I have
been told he made plenty of dept), one of my parents emptied my
savings-account(it is unknown whom as the resources to find out outweigh the
benefits), having had a sex-changed „stepmother” who was prevented by my own
government from having contact with me after I was placed back with my father
and unfortunately much more to strongly wish for change in this world as these
things exists and are possible because people NEED to be selfish in order to
survive in our economy or are sanctioned to do wrong after they already ensured their survival long after they have come to pass away.
Why do I not enter politics to create this?Regulations have shown me that doing things within politics takes up a lot of time and if people donate it is a clear proof that the majority of the world wants a change as I propose and wish to create. Will I (once) enter politics? I think that once things are ready and I notice that there is a support group then I have every intention to make a change; by entering the upcoming elections in 2017 or 2021 in my home country (Netherlands).Why do I ask for 7 billion euro?(This number has somewhat of a
meaning and is why I did not go for a smaller amount such as for example €- 250.000
– because I think that the number can become a message and represent
something, for example 

- 
It can represent a signal to the world
that people do not want war and have a rough % estimate of people who do not
want ANY war or conflict at all in this world. -
It can also be a social experiment: not everyone on our planet 
can donate €- 1 so if we do not achieve the main target then this means 
either that people have no faith in my project, no credit card, no internet or perhaps even that the system of the
 very rich contributing to the poor is not working as well as we would hope it might.To track this I have created a perk
inside indiegogo which you activate when you donate 1 euro and is one
that we expect to achieve automatically once everyone in the world has every
basic human need (for this reason I ask anyone that reads this to share this
page with their friends and acquaintances).",1.0,0,"3 Campaigns

We hope to once again fill that void at the cultural center of Gainesville.<br/><br/>We will be opening in the former dining room of The Wine &amp; Cheese Gallery. This unique space provides us with the great opportunity to be located downtown, in heart of Gainesville's cultural scene. The floor to ceiling windows, potential for sidewalk seating, and two level storefront will set us a part from our neighbors and past iterations of local bookstores. <br/><br/>Community is very important to us, so Third House Books &amp; Coffee plans on being a destination space, where locals and visitors will come to relax, browse, and socialize. We are excited to become an integral part of the community, and to serve your needs and passions, whether that be reading and writing groups, community activism, art shows, author readings and visits, and other social events.

Because of such great support we outgrew our current roaster and the coffee community came together to bless us with a new (to us) 10kg roaster.

I stayed in my parents home town of Port-a-Piment located in the south of Haiti about 4 and 1/2 hrs from the capitol.  After over 30 yrs of absence, I was shocked to see that time had not been kind to the town.  This was a town full of activity such as commerce, agriculture and livestock.  Signs of poverty was all around, the town had been a victim of a major hurricane which destroyed the pipes bringing in drinking water, then drought (9 months without rain in 2015) and practically no jobs in the private sector.  Farmers no longer tended the land and not much was being grown.  The town of Port-a-Piment serves as host to the largest cave system in the Caribbean.  The lack of economic growth makes it impossible for the inhabitants to take advantage of the tourist activity in the town.  </span>

USAID states ""It is estimated that, in some departments of the country (Haiti), up to 30 percent of children suffer from chronic malnutrition. Although more than 50 percent of Haitians work in agriculture, up to half of Haiti’s food is imported.""                  
Agriculture is definitely the answer.  

Having left Haiti at a young age, I returned in 2009 and have been going back. I stayed in my parents home town of Port-a-Piment located in the south of Haiti about 4 and 1/2 hrs from the capitol.  After over 30 yrs of absence, I was shocked to see that time had not been kind to the town.  This was a town full of activity such as commerce, agriculture and livestock.  Signs of poverty was all around, the town had been a victim of a major hurricane which destroyed the pipes bringing in drinking water, then drought (9 months without rain in 2015) and practically no jobs in the private sector.  Farmers no longer tended the land and not much was being grown.  The town of Port-a-Piment serves as host to the largest cave system in the Caribbean.  The lack of economic growth makes it impossible for the inhabitants to take advantage of the tourist activity in the town.  

All this tugged at my heart and I knew that doing nothing was not an option. I needed to get involved to make a difference but knew I would need help.  I decided to embark on this long term project and solicited the help of a few family members and friends.  But now we need your help.
*We are committed to keeping you updated on the project.  
   What we have:



 We have the land, two acres in town and 12 acres on the outskirts of town have been purchased (I contributed a good portion of my retirement funds for the purchase but now need your help to get the project to come to life) 

a small start up fund
manpower to work on the land

 molds needed to build the dome have been donated to our project 



What we need is your contribution

It will be used to:



 enclose and secure the land 


dig two wells and purchase materials to set up an irrigation system 

purchase tools, seeds, fertilizer for major food crops such as yams, peas, corn and a variety of vegetables.
 tilling of the land 

 preservation and harvesting of 12 gigantic mango trees already on the land  

create jobs that will improve the quality of life of the inhabitants 
help educate farmers on various agriculture techniques and provide them with necessary tools to farm land that they either own or lease 
 build a geodesic dome nursery to provide start up crops to local and surrounding farmers to encourage a return to agriculture 


Benefits of a Growing Greenhouse Dome

domes meet or exceed FEMA’s standards for providing near-absolute protection.  
They are proven survivors of tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and fires. 
most sufficient in terms of practicality and convenience 
 made to produce plants, fresh fruits and vegetables without worrying about the seasons
extend fruiting season 
 saves on energy because domes are solar powered




The Impact

 

How will your contribution impact the community?

 Improve the quality of life of the people of Port-a-Piment and surrounding areas by providing food and economic security through agriculture.   
The addition of the dome greenhouse will promote a new  and secure way to grow plants, vegetables and fruits in an unpredictable climate.
The success of this project will serve to encourage others in the private sector to invest in agriculture therefore ensuring economic growth in the southern region.  

We are currently very active in the community.  We are members of a non profit organization that is fully involved in the re-development of Port-a-Piment.  Please feel free to visit the organization's website at http://portapiment.com

<p>In October, we launched our Marriage Mentorship Program entitled #RelationshipGoals. Relationship Goals is a monthly interactive workshop for couples and singles. Each seminar is led by our Marriage Mentors and covers a topic that helps attendees reach common goals, avoid major pitfalls, and build lasting memories. Our goals are to help couples maintain and improve their relationships and to help singles prepare for and enter a new relationship. The purpose of this campaign is to raise the necessary funds to run the program for one year. </p>
<p>We have secured our mentors, dates, and topics, all we need is a home for our workshops. We've met with community centers and other venues and found that the monthly cost to rent a space is about $200. In addition to the cost of the venue, we would like to pay our mentors $100 per seminar. Our mentors are licensed professionals and seasoned married couples who have agreed to lead workshops in their area of expertise.There are a few other expenses that will need to be covered but we are only asking for the bare minimum to get this program started. We are currently working to receive tax exempt status therefore it is difficult for us to receive grants. This is why we are calling on you to donate. No amount is too small.  We thank you in advance!</p>
