<br/><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Triking is becoming very popular because of the enjoyment of moving on these 3 wheeled vehicles. They mix together comfort, mechanical  simplicity of bikes and that cool go-kart feeling.  They make possible to go again into cycling those who find hard to ride 
their normal bikes. Also trikes are great platform for tourers, pedal 
voyagers, commuters, recreational cyclists and avid aventurers. There are many good 
commercial trikes in the stores, unfortunately they come at a price. 
While they are well built and nice, there is also a customer’s request 
for a quality trike that performs just as well as any other but much 
more pocket friendly. It all seems to be a calling for a design and production challenge. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/><p>While the design and prototyping phases shows that a good trike at the right cost is feasible, the vision of the project has become much wider, as automotive suppliers have joined us to the vision.  These companies were producing motorbikes frames for main world brands 24 hours a day. Recently these big names  moved production to other suppliers elsewhere, and so the managers of the Spain factories have changed the way they think and work. Designers, engineers and production professionals are happy to offer their in-house 
high-volume production capabilities directly to the end user. 
Now is time to work together for the benefit of the customer, creating 
relevant products at its right cost, away from traditional complex 
business structures. Is a democratization of the means of production.<br/></p>In the end it all relays on the real demand, so if you want the best value trike, we will gladly produce it for you. <br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FX_raGIL8aX8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX_raGIL8aX8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FX_raGIL8aX8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>

              which caused the crisis. But so far its production is small in quantity, so this campaign is about growing in size and being able to supply more people in need. My dream is to build a factory for bigger production, first in Bulgaria and then all over the world.</p>

<h3>How does YARG-95 work?</h3>
<p>
                People suffering from renal diseases must be aware of the 
                following: a stone in the kidney in the most serious cases can 
                be operated or it can be broken by means of lithotripsy, while 
                pyelonephritis cannot be operated, it must be cured in time, 
                otherwise it ruins the kidney. Furthermore, if a small stone is 
                found in the kidney, it must be “attacked” immediately because a 
                small stone after a certain period of time becomes big, then an 
                operation follows, and sometimes it drives to the kidney 
                removal.</p>

                Renal crisis 
                </b></p>
<p>Renal crisis <span>
                c</span>auses 
                feeling of pain, which is one the strongest in the human 
                pathology. In principle, the treatment of a renal crisis is the 
                same as it was 150 years ago. The difference is that now we have 
                more remedies, among which there are antispasmodic and analgesic 
                remedies for basic  treatment so that the pain is relieved.</p>
<br/>
<h4>
<b>Methods for prevention of stone formation in the kidneys</b><br/>
</h4>
<p>
              There 
              is no a remedy in the world, which can stop the formation of 
              stones in the kidneys. Once the organism has started their 
              formation, the process cannot be diverted. Evidence of that are 
              patients, who are operated several times for stones in the 
              kidneys. This is where the methodology of the Hosanna medicine-man 
              works. It is highly efficient but unfortunately, it is little 
              known. After an operation of a kidney stone, after lithotripsy of 
              a kidney stone, after a successful treatment of a kidney stone 
              with herbs, after the application of this technique, the problem 
              with stones in the kidneys is resolved once and for all.<br/></p>

people to have access to this product. Yarg-95 is licensed and helped 
many over the years. My dream is to make its access easier, because I 
have seen with my own eyes the real power of the product- people coming to my father helpless in their suffering and going home healed.</p>

<p>Здравейте,казвам се Яна Георгиева и съм студентка по фармация.Аз съм от България, една малка, но прекрасна страна, за жалост не толкова известна на останалата част от света.<br/></p>
<p>Аз съм една горда дъщеря- горда от постиженията на баща си. Той е прекрасен човек. Винаги казва ""Взел съм от природата, за да дам на хората"". Всъщност той е билколечител. Занимава се  с билколечение повече от 35 години.И така ето ме и мен,вървейки по неговите стъпки, за да дам на хората, дар от природата. Може да намерите повече информация за него и продукта на  <a href=""http://www.yarg95.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.yarg95.com</a> .</p>

<p> ""ЯРГ-95"" представлява билков 
          продукт, отварата на който е изключително ефективна при овладяване на 
          бъбречната криза, както и ускореното изхвърляне на камъчето, 
          предизвикало кризата.За сега обаче продукцията му е ограничена, така че тази кампания е за увеличаването на продукцията и осигуряване възможността продукта да достигне до повече  хора в нужда. Моята мечта е да построя фабрика за производство първо в България, а после защо не и по света!<br/></p>

<h3>Как работи YARG-95?</h3>
<p>
                Всеки 
                страдащ от бъбреци трябва да знае следното:<br/>
  Един камък в бъбрека в най тежкия случай може да бъде опериран или 
                разбит чрез литотрипсия, докато един пиелонефрит не може да се 
                оперира, той трябва своевременно да се лекува, в противен случай 
                разрушава бъбрека, респективно бъбреците,малкото камъче трябва да бъде атакувано незабавно, защото в противен случай,след време , малкото камъче ,може да се превърне в голямо,тук е и мястото на употреба на ЯРГа , когато камъчето е с размери 2-3 мм,</p>
<h4><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445187650/jrvnox8wp1ycaryatxf1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h4>

<p>
<b>
                
                Бъбречна криза<br/></b></p>
<p><span> 
                Предизвиква усещане на болка, която е една от най-силните в 
                човешката патология*. По принцип лечението на бъбречната криза е 
                същото, каквото е било преди 150 години. Сега имаме по-голям 
                арсенал от медикаменти, при които основното лечение са 
                спазмолитичните и аналгетични средства с цел овладяване на 
                болката. </span></p>

<h4>
<b><strong>Методика за 
          предотвратяване<br/>
          на образуването на камъни в бъбреците</strong></b>
</h4>
<p>
              На световно ниво няма 
              определено лекарство, което да спре образуването на камъни в 
              бъбреците. Веднъж организмът започнал образуването им, процесът е 
              непрекъсваем. Доказателство за това са оперираните по няколко пъти 
              за камъни в бъбреците.  Тук е мястото на методиката на Хисарския 
              лечител, която е с доказана ефективност, но за съжаление малко или 
              почти неизвестна като факт. След операция на камък в бъбрека, след 
              литотрипсия, след успешно билколечение, след прилагането на тази 
              методика, проблема с камъните в бъбреците се решава веднъж 
              завинаги.</p>

 Hello, my name is Yana Georgieva and I am a pharmacy student. I am from Bulgaria one little precious country, unfortunately not so well known to the rest of the world. 
I am one proud daughter of my father`s accomplishments. He`s one great person. He always says ""I have gathered from nature to give to the human kind"".  Actually he is Hosanna 
            Medicine-man. He has been involved in the field of herbal treatment 
            for over 35 years. So here is me walking in his footsteps to bring man a gift from nature. You can find more information about him and the product on www.yarg95.com .
        

 “YARG-95” 
              is a herbal product, whose tea is extremely effective in coping 
              with the renal crisis, as well as quick excretion of the stone, 
              which caused the crisis. But so far its production is small in quantity, so this campaign is about growing in size and being able to supply more people in need. My dream is to build a factory for bigger production, first in Bulgaria and then all over the world.



How does YARG-95 work?

                People suffering from renal diseases must be aware of the 
                following: a stone in the kidney in the most serious cases can 
                be operated or it can be broken by means of lithotripsy, while 
                pyelonephritis cannot be operated, it must be cured in time, 
                otherwise it ruins the kidney. Furthermore, if a small stone is 
                found in the kidney, it must be “attacked” immediately because a 
                small stone after a certain period of time becomes big, then an 
                operation follows, and sometimes it drives to the kidney 
                removal.



                
                Renal crisis 
                
Renal crisis 
                causes 
                feeling of pain, which is one the strongest in the human 
                pathology. In principle, the treatment of a renal crisis is the 
                same as it was 150 years ago. The difference is that now we have 
                more remedies, among which there are antispasmodic and analgesic 
                remedies for basic  treatment so that the pain is relieved.


Methods for prevention of stone formation in the kidneys


              There 
              is no a remedy in the world, which can stop the formation of 
              stones in the kidneys. Once the organism has started their 
              formation, the process cannot be diverted. Evidence of that are 
              patients, who are operated several times for stones in the 
              kidneys. This is where the methodology of the Hosanna medicine-man 
              works. It is highly efficient but unfortunately, it is little 
              known. After an operation of a kidney stone, after lithotripsy of 
              a kidney stone, after a successful treatment of a kidney stone 
              with herbs, after the application of this technique, the problem 
              with stones in the kidneys is resolved once and for all.


Cases

K. S. from Sofiya– There was found a stone in 
                                the left ureter with size 20/13 mm. The medical 
                                specialists explicitly recommend surgery.After two months of herbal treatment, 
                                the man excreted the stone of 20/13 mm. Incredible 
                                but true. 
                              P. Z. from the town of Pazardzhik – The child 
                                underwent a surgery for removal of stones from 
                                the left kidney at the age of 12 months. Only 
                                after 6 months there was found a stone in the 
                                left ureter with size 18/6 mm. The medical specialists 
                                from Pazardzhik, Plovdiv and Sofia explicitly 
                                recommend surgery.After three months of herbal treatment, 
                                the child excreted the stone of 18/6 mm. Incredible 
                                but true.
S. K. – town of Troyan – 
                          The renal crisis was put under control after the third 
                          dose of the YARG-95 
                          herb tea was drunk. Two stones were excreted.Y. R. – town of Plovdiv – Having a renal 
                          crisis for 10 days. The urine is bloody and cloudy.After the intake of the first 250 ml of 
                          YARG-95 herb tea the pain stopped. A stone was 
                          excreted, the urine was cleared.  


  You can be the pillar that supports my dream
I need your help. I need your support. I want to build a factory to produce herbal product YARG-95. Having our own factory would give us brand security. I would be able to
 produce high-quality products at low prices.



What we need :

high quality materials in order to pass all healthcare and quality requirements
get marketing expertise
to get proffecionalist who systematically de-risk our idea

technicaly advanced shredding and packing mashines (only one costs $150 000)

biulding specialized storage with low humidity for keeping the production and ingredients

Even if I don't reach the entire goal every dollar will be invested in my idea. I will start with small steps and eventually reach my goal.
 


Every dollar YOU donate is a step further to helping people all over the world.

Only people who have felt the pain and struggle to get their
 normal lives back can relate how important  is more and more 
people to have access to this product. Yarg-95 is licensed and helped 
many over the years. My dream is to make its access easier, because I 
have seen with my own eyes the real power of the product- people coming to my father helpless in their suffering and going home healed.
As we go into a new year many of us are focused on setting new goals, defining new  paths, but I have always had one single path - I wanted to help people.


                



“What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.” - Ralph Waldo Emerson

It
 is true that a rough road stand before us, but I am certain that I have
 the power and motivation to complete the challenges and come out 
victorious. I know I have to do it not only for me but for those who 
suffer.
 I refuse to let a dream, a legacy go to waste. I know I 
won`t be alone. I know I won`t face the challenges by myself. I have my family and all of YOU to support me. Together we can see it through the end and be proud of ourselves what we have accomplished.
I am not blinded by my dream. I can see clearly the risks of my actions, but if you ask me ""Is it worth it?"", ""Would you do it again?"" my answer will always be "" Yes! Yes! "" 
There always lies the possibility of failiure, but should we stop trying? Don`t we deserve brighter furture? What do you think?

Здравейте,казвам се Яна Георгиева и съм студентка по фармация.Аз съм от България, една малка, но прекрасна страна, за жалост не толкова известна на останалата част от света.
Аз съм една горда дъщеря- горда от постиженията на баща си. Той е прекрасен човек. Винаги казва ""Взел съм от природата, за да дам на хората"". Всъщност той е билколечител. Занимава се  с билколечение повече от 35 години.И така ето ме и мен,вървейки по неговите стъпки, за да дам на хората, дар от природата. Може да намерите повече информация за него и продукта на  www.yarg95.com .
  
 ""ЯРГ-95"" представлява билков 
          продукт, отварата на който е изключително ефективна при овладяване на 
          бъбречната криза, както и ускореното изхвърляне на камъчето, 
          предизвикало кризата.За сега обаче продукцията му е ограничена, така че тази кампания е за увеличаването на продукцията и осигуряване възможността продукта да достигне до повече  хора в нужда. Моята мечта е да построя фабрика за производство първо в България, а после защо не и по света!


Как работи YARG-95?

                Всеки 
                страдащ от бъбреци трябва да знае следното:
  Един камък в бъбрека в най тежкия случай може да бъде опериран или 
                разбит чрез литотрипсия, докато един пиелонефрит не може да се 
                оперира, той трябва своевременно да се лекува, в противен случай 
                разрушава бъбрека, респективно бъбреците,малкото камъче трябва да бъде атакувано незабавно, защото в противен случай,след време , малкото камъче ,може да се превърне в голямо,тук е и мястото на употреба на ЯРГа , когато камъчето е с размери 2-3 мм,




                
                Бъбречна криза
 
                Предизвиква усещане на болка, която е една от най-силните в 
                човешката патология*. По принцип лечението на бъбречната криза е 
                същото, каквото е било преди 150 години. Сега имаме по-голям 
                арсенал от медикаменти, при които основното лечение са 
                спазмолитичните и аналгетични средства с цел овладяване на 
                болката. 


Методика за 
          предотвратяване
          на образуването на камъни в бъбреците


              На световно ниво няма 
              определено лекарство, което да спре образуването на камъни в 
              бъбреците. Веднъж организмът започнал образуването им, процесът е 
              непрекъсваем. Доказателство за това са оперираните по няколко пъти 
              за камъни в бъбреците.  Тук е мястото на методиката на Хисарския 
              лечител, която е с доказана ефективност, но за съжаление малко или 
              почти неизвестна като факт. След операция на камък в бъбрека, след 
              литотрипсия, след успешно билколечение, след прилагането на тази 
              методика, проблема с камъните в бъбреците се решава веднъж 
              завинаги.

Факти

                  
              Д.М., гр. София: Близо 2 години е с болки в левия бъбрек.
								Живее почти на обезболяващи. От многобройните изследвания не е 
установена причината за тези оплаквания.
								След проведения разговор изказах съмнение за камък в левия 
уретер, при което Д.М. ми каза, че диагностиките са правени от водещи 
специалисти,
								така че моето съмнение било абсурдно. След проведеното 
билколечение изкарва камък 6/3 мм. Няма болки.
								
 
                                Р.Т., гр. София: Установен е камък 5 мм.
 м долната част на левия уретер. Направени са 5 литотрипсии без 
резултат. 
								След едномесечно билколечение изкарва камъка.
								
 
                                Н.Г., гр. Стара Загора: След остри болки
 в дясно - операция на апендикса. Болките продължават. След двуседмично 
билколечение вади камък 4 мм. от
								десен уретер. Няма болки.
								
  
                                 К.С., гр. София: Установен е камък в десния 
                                уретер с размери 20/13 мм. Специалистите са категорични 
                                - операция.
                                  След проведено двумесечно билколечение 
                                той изкарва камъка с размери 20/13 мм. Невероятно, 
                                но факт.
  
                                 П.З., гр. Пазарджик: На 12 месеца детето 
                                е оперирано за отливъчен конкретемент (камък в 
                                левия бъбрек). Само след 6 месеца е установен 
                                камък в левия уретер с размери 18/6 мм. Специалистите 
                                от Пазарджик, Пловдив, София са категорични - 
                                операция.
                                  След проведено три месечно билколечение 
                                детето изкарва камъка с размери 18/6 мм. Невероятно, 
                                но факт.

   С.К., гр. Троян: Бъбречната криза е 
                          овладяна след третото приемане на отварата от 
""ЯРГ-95"".Изкарва два 
                          камъка.

   И.Р., гр. Пловдив: С бъбречна криза от 
                          10 дни. Урината е кърваво червена и мътна. След 
                          употребата на първите 250 мл. от от отварата на 
""ЯРГ-95""
болките спират. Изкарва камък, урината се 
                          изчиства.   

 Можете да бъдете основата за изграждането на моята мечта

Нуждая се от помощта Ви. Нуждая се от подкрепата Ви.Искам да построя фабрика, за да произвеждам билковия продукт ЯРГ- 95. Имайки моя собствена фабрика, ще ми даде сигурност и стабилност на марката и продукта като цяло. Ще мога да произвеждам продукти с високо качество, на нормални цени.

От какво се нуждаем :

висококачествени материали, за да отговаряме на всички необходими изисквания

да получа маркетингова експертиза

да назнача професионалисти, които да намалят риска от грешки до минимум

машини за рязане и опаковане, отговарящи на всички изисквания(само едната струва $150 000)
построяване на специално оборудвани складове, в които да е възможно поддържането на определена влажност


Дори да не достигна крайната сума, всеки долар, който дарите, ще бъде включен в проекта ми.Ще започна с малки стъпки, по пътя за достигане на крайната ми цел. 

Всеки долар, който дарявате, е стъпка напред, в сбъдването на една мечта.
Само хора, които са почувствали истинската сила на болката, биха имали представа колко важно е повече хора, да имат достъп до продукта.Yarg-95 е патентован и е помагал на много хора през годините. Мечтата ми е да направя достъпа до продукта по-лесен, защо не ,да бъде на крачка в аптеката до Вас, тъй като съм виждала със собствените си очи, истинската му сила- хора идвайки безпомощни с болката си при баща ми, си тръгват излекувани.
Когато преминаваме през годините много от нас си поставят различни цели, избират нови пътеки, но аз винаги съм искала един ясен път -да получа възможността да помагам на хората.

<p>Invented in 2009 by Michael and Christopher Hoskins, the Surf
Skooter was created to fill the niche between surfing and bodyboarding. Each
year thousands of beachgoers find themselves caught in the void of, “struggling
to become a good surfer or settling for bodyboarding.” Unable to find a product
that fills this middle ground, 10-year-old Michael and his father Chris, went
to Home Depot, purchased some basic materials and invented the Surf Skooter. </p>
<p>Despite our humble beginnings, we wanted to ensure the Surf
Skooter was a product we could be proud of. With this in mind, we spent the
last 6 years refining the entire design. Moreover, we knew that if the Surf
Skooter was truly going to be the world’s <i>next
great water sport</i>, it had to be a blast in fresh water and snow!</p>
<p>Today we are excited to announce the culmination of our hard work!
With your contributions through donations and social media, you will soon be
able to see these beauties shredding on a wave near you!</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>In order to make the
Surf Skooter a reality, we need your help in funding the expensive tooling
required to begin manufacturing (approx. $13,000). We also need enough capital to
purchase Skooter components at a volume discount! (approx. $15,000) If we

Most of us, especially if overweight, have what's called Leaky Gut Syndrome - where toxins leak into our body from our small intestines and harm us greatly.   You don't digest foods properly, caused by several factors, but primarily from a bad diet over the years.</p><p>Cut out the bad foods that are harming you and follow the ODC Silver Bullet STEPS above to not only get healthy again but let the weight fly-off you naturally.  While assisting with leaky gut syndrome and improving your gut health.  That leads in part to avoiding Endocrine Disorders - where the glands in your body do not function properly and lead to weight gain and disease (the Thyroid is one prime example, if not functioning properly, then weight issues are often inevitable).</p><p><strong>GUT HEALTH.</strong>  New accepted theory is:  that your GUT is perhaps the engine of your body.  If its not working properly you get fat, don't function properly, get brain fog, low energy and you get diseases like diabetes, heart disease, cancer and so on.</p><p><strong>So Keep It Simple: Get Good Gut Health now and feel great.

Virtually 3 of 4 packaged foods (74%) include sugar (Quote per Dr. Frank Lustig, MD)</p><p>    Dinner, made with whole foods, and eaten at the table is a long-forgotten memory, while bringing home fast, convenience food is commonplace,</p><p>    The number of families where both parents work has doubled – and adults are working longer hours,</p><p>    For many, there are simply not enough hours in the day to prepare quality whole foods (Or, is it a matter of setting priorities?),</p><p>    Physical education in schools has been dramatically reduced (In the US, only 6 states require physical education in every grade, Kindergarten–12),</p><p>    In the US, only one in three children are physically active every day (and we wonder how many of these children reside in the states where activity is mandated in their schools?), and</p><p>    Fast food outlets are virtually everywhere and offer convenience to time-starved families - leading to terrible food choices.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Hint:</strong> Prepare your daily meals in advance and warm them prior to serving.  Freeze them if you must. NEVER use a microwave as they are very unhealthy – the body can’t digest microwaved foods properly.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Adult obesity rates for selected countries are shown in the chart below:</strong></p><p><i><strong>World Rank Country Adult Obesity Rate</strong></i></p><p>12.   United States of America 35.0%</p><p>24.   New Zealand 30.6%</p><p>25.   Canada 30.1%</p><p>26.   Australia 29.9%</p><p>27.   United Kingdom 29.8%</p><p>So, if you, a friend or family member is obese, we really mean it when we say, You are not alone!  </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>       Of course, the question is: ""What should people do to lose weight?""</strong></h3><p> </p><p><strong>Use The Silver Bullet Approach(TM) is one great step.  </strong></p><p><strong>Avoid Failure </strong>for a change and do something you can actually maintain and complete easily.</p><p>In many cases generally, our advice is clear: (1) Make an appointment with your Doctor and seek his/her recommendations; also meet with your trusted Health Care Professional for additional advice and information, (2) Create and follow a healthy diet and activity program, and (3) Have perseverance and patience.</p><p>Important: You must discuss the issue of balancing your blood sugar and the effect that insulin levels have on your body with your Doctor and Health Care Professional. This is a key problem, which may lead to obesity.</p><p>Blood sugar levels and insulin are related. Insulin helps balance your blood sugar levels.  Here’s how, as explained by endocrineweb: </p><p>“The cells in your body need sugar for energy. However, sugar cannot go into most of your cells directly. After you eat food and your blood sugar level rises, cells in your pancreas (known as beta cells) are signaled to release insulin into your bloodstream…</p><p>If you have more sugar in your body than it needs, insulin helps store the sugar in your liver and releases it when your blood sugar level is low or if you need more sugar, such as in between meals or during physical activity. Therefore, insulin helps balance out blood sugar levels and keeps them in a normal range. As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas secretes more insulin.</p><p>If your body does not produce enough insulin or your cells are resistant to the effects of insulin, you may develop hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), which can cause long-term complications if the blood sugar levels stay elevated for long periods of time.”</p><p>In addition to this website endocrineweb, there is an interesting book, The Obesity Code, written by Jason Fung, MD, which explores this subject in depth.</p><p><strong>You need to remember that people do not become overweight or obese overnight; neither should they expect to lose their excess weight rapidly either.  </strong></p><p><strong>Slow and steady wins the race.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Weight Loss Shows:</strong>    Weight-loss television shows may be entertaining, but they are often not reality. Certainly, one will likely lose weight by exercising hard and consuming relatively few calories each day in a controlled environment, but who can adopt such an approach into daily life?</p><p>We should point out that many of these shows’ contestants gain weight after they leave the show and that explains the real problem: For many, the barrier to sustained weight-loss is being left on one’s own to tackle it.

Most of us, especially if overweight, have what's called Leaky Gut Syndrome - where toxins leak into our body from our small intestines and harm us greatly.   You don't digest foods properly, caused by several factors, but primarily from a bad diet over the years.Cut out the bad foods that are harming you and follow the ODC Silver Bullet STEPS above to not only get healthy again but let the weight fly-off you naturally.  While assisting with leaky gut syndrome and improving your gut health.  That leads in part to avoiding Endocrine Disorders - where the glands in your body do not function properly and lead to weight gain and disease (the Thyroid is one prime example, if not functioning properly, then weight issues are often inevitable).GUT HEALTH.  New accepted theory is:  that your GUT is perhaps the engine of your body.  If its not working properly you get fat, don't function properly, get brain fog, low energy and you get diseases like diabetes, heart disease, cancer and so on.So Keep It Simple: Get Good Gut Health now and feel great.

Virtually 3 of 4 packaged foods (74%) include sugar (Quote per Dr. Frank Lustig, MD)    Dinner, made with whole foods, and eaten at the table is a long-forgotten memory, while bringing home fast, convenience food is commonplace,    The number of families where both parents work has doubled – and adults are working longer hours,    For many, there are simply not enough hours in the day to prepare quality whole foods (Or, is it a matter of setting priorities?),    Physical education in schools has been dramatically reduced (In the US, only 6 states require physical education in every grade, Kindergarten–12),    In the US, only one in three children are physically active every day (and we wonder how many of these children reside in the states where activity is mandated in their schools?), and    Fast food outlets are virtually everywhere and offer convenience to time-starved families - leading to terrible food choices. Hint: Prepare your daily meals in advance and warm them prior to serving.  Freeze them if you must. NEVER use a microwave as they are very unhealthy – the body can’t digest microwaved foods properly. Adult obesity rates for selected countries are shown in the chart below:World Rank Country Adult Obesity Rate12.   United States of America 35.0%24.   New Zealand 30.6%25.   Canada 30.1%26.   Australia 29.9%27.   United Kingdom 29.8%So, if you, a friend or family member is obese, we really mean it when we say, You are not alone!         Of course, the question is: ""What should people do to lose weight?"" Use The Silver Bullet Approach(TM) is one great step.  Avoid Failure for a change and do something you can actually maintain and complete easily.In many cases generally, our advice is clear: (1) Make an appointment with your Doctor and seek his/her recommendations; also meet with your trusted Health Care Professional for additional advice and information, (2) Create and follow a healthy diet and activity program, and (3) Have perseverance and patience.Important: You must discuss the issue of balancing your blood sugar and the effect that insulin levels have on your body with your Doctor and Health Care Professional. This is a key problem, which may lead to obesity.Blood sugar levels and insulin are related. Insulin helps balance your blood sugar levels.  Here’s how, as explained by endocrineweb: “The cells in your body need sugar for energy. However, sugar cannot go into most of your cells directly. After you eat food and your blood sugar level rises, cells in your pancreas (known as beta cells) are signaled to release insulin into your bloodstream…If you have more sugar in your body than it needs, insulin helps store the sugar in your liver and releases it when your blood sugar level is low or if you need more sugar, such as in between meals or during physical activity. Therefore, insulin helps balance out blood sugar levels and keeps them in a normal range. As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas secretes more insulin.If your body does not produce enough insulin or your cells are resistant to the effects of insulin, you may develop hyperglycemia (high blood sugar), which can cause long-term complications if the blood sugar levels stay elevated for long periods of time.”In addition to this website endocrineweb, there is an interesting book, The Obesity Code, written by Jason Fung, MD, which explores this subject in depth.You need to remember that people do not become overweight or obese overnight; neither should they expect to lose their excess weight rapidly either.  Slow and steady wins the race. Weight Loss Shows:    Weight-loss television shows may be entertaining, but they are often not reality. Certainly, one will likely lose weight by exercising hard and consuming relatively few calories each day in a controlled environment, but who can adopt such an approach into daily life?We should point out that many of these shows’ contestants gain weight after they leave the show and that explains the real problem: For many, the barrier to sustained weight-loss is being left on one’s own to tackle it. Chances are you need regular help. A Recipe For Disaster:If we were having a conversation about this, we would advise you (with your doctor’s permission and endorsement) to start by simply counting your calories and being aware of the normal adult levels to give you a sense of making better food choices.

Certain clinics also offered pharmacy, laboratory, imagining, dental, physio, psychiatry, and other services in addition to family medicine and walk-in care.  He has been involved with projects including cardiovascular monitoring over the internet, PRP / Stem Cells, and Electronic Medical Records.  Also controlled previously with a small team 100 optical stores with optical lab.  He has previously been an author, broadcaster and public speaker.He understands the medical business, how it functions and how the new delivery model to help others truly needs to be online - to save the health care system extensive costs and to be practical in today's evolving world. Plus after working with doctors for over the past 30 years knows the importance of only using medical professionals to provide and prove any strategies before providing the same for information purposes.He is approaching the age of 60 and has the experience, drive and ability to lead the Online Diet Clinics onto greatness.  He is not a doctor rather an experienced businessman. He has great vision and compassion for others and knows how to treat all team members with respect and to give them the confidence so they can personally excel.  And truly wants to help others.  Previously he has been involved with extensive real estate development projects - if you can build buildings you can get thru many business issues at all levels.A Personal Note from Our Founder:""My personal weight loss journey started over 8 years ago - initially I lost about 35 pounds over a few months.  But more importantly I discovered how to keep the weight off for life.Today I am about 40 pounds below where I started and doing a good job of maintaining my weight.  More importantly I have discovered that disease is directly related to our nutrition.  We will share many of these insights with you.  However no one needs to be perfect.  I certainly am not!  I have ups and downs like so many of us.  Life just is not perfect.Initially we started out to create an online medical clinic to help others - only to realize that doctors can not generally provide their services outside of their jurisdiction of governance or not even online in most jurisdictions.  However, we know that the future of health care must be delivered online.Accordingly, we have developed our delivery model, systems and processes - they really are unique and will help change the world. So when challenged with not being able to have doctors directly on staff - we turned to perhaps something better.  We decided to draw upon world leading medical professionals and authorities to help others - and not to be restricted to just any one physician. We have spent the majority of our time not on marketing; rather on development and research (as one can only imagine how consuming that must be).  So when we say we can potentially save you years of research to understand how to deal with obesity or weight loss - we mean it.I was perhaps one of the several pioneers in developing walk-in medical clinics many years ago.  Today walk-in medical clinics are very common.  We anticipate that our style of online clinics will also become common within 15 years.  For now we are unique - but our strategies are based upon the years of experience and studies of certain medical professionals.We truly are here to help and will do our best by you.  I wish you well on your health journey and really hope that we can assist you or your loved ones. Our Vision is to revolutionize how we ALL manage or prevent disease and to enhance LONGEVITY.""    In our case, it will be, ""One Client at a Time."" TEAM and TEAM MEMBERS TO DEVELOPManaging Director                      Senior CoachesAssociate Coaches                      Medical AdvisersNatural Health Advisers             Research AssociatesCommunications Director         Operations DirectorOperations Staff                            Marketing & Client Support  CONTACT US:   TheClinicsOnline@gmail.com  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERWE ARE NOT DOCTORS.  OUR SERVICES CAN NOT BE CONSTRUED AS MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS, MEDICAL TREATMENT, OR CURE OF ANY DISEASE, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THOSE SERVICES, WHICH CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED BY A LICENSED PHYSICIAN OR DOCTOR. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES OFFERED RESPECTING OUTCOMES OR RESULTS OF OUR SERVICES AND PLANS.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After spending years in a high-stress tech job, struggling with low level inflammation for most of my life, I finally got really sick. But according to the endless doctors I visited, there was nothing wrong with me, even after months of tests and missed work and discomfort. When my illness finally mysteriously went away, I left tech, went to health-supportive culinary school, and then founded and managed a health-supportive food company in DC for about 5 years (Postmodern Foods).</p>
<p>Once I realized the most satisfying part of running a food business was watching my loyal customers gradually eat better, improve their lives, leave bad marriages, move up the ladder at work, and just generally look/feel/act better, I knew I wanted to develop systems that would scale larger than me, or my customer base in DC, or any one dietary paradigm. I realized over years of counseling people regularly, that no one diet works for all people - not even for the same person from hour to hour, day to day, or year to year. You see, our environment is constantly evolving (morning is sunny, evening is dark, for example), and our bodies are evolving both as a result of internal and external factors (e.g. I got in a fight with my spouse today).</p>
<p>I, and a small team, want to bring to market an app that will incorporate everything I've learned, both formally in the classroom at the world's best-known health-supportive culinary school (Natural Gourmet Institute), and in real-world practice for 5 years. <strong>I want to bring together eastern and western insights, like expansive/contractive and DNA analysis, to provide a world-class nutrition coaching app that will suggest ideal foods for you no matter where you are, respond to your biofeedback, adjust, provide robust tracking, and make it fun through social support and competitions!</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will not only provide you first-adopter access to the app once it's built, but it will also open the door to the most-affordable, most-predictive, most-customized healthy eating app on the market.</p>
<p>Plus, not only will you be helping yourself by eating better, you'll also be helping someone in need: for each yearly subscription, we'll give one away to someone who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford or access any type of nutritional coaching. <strong>If good nutrition is the cornerstone of good health, this is how we begin to level the playing field between the classes in our country, while also making a dent in health care costs: about 20% of the US GDP is spent on healthcare, about 80% of which is spent on chronic diseases which are preventable through better diet and lifestyle choices! Let's make those choices smarter, easier, and more accessible.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $50,000 to develop, market, and release Panacea! Most of this will be going to custom development work and integrations necessary to make a unique nutritional algorithm and allow integrations with food providers like Instacart.</p>
<p>For the interested: For $1 you can get access to all our latest updates, before the general public.</p>
<p>For the early bird: For $80 you can get free access to the app for 1 year after launch.</p>
<p>For the future user: For $100 you can get free access to the app for 1 year after launch.</p>
<p>For the early bird who's on board: For $180 you can get free access to the app for 1 year, including DNA testing results and analysis.</p>

After spending years in a high-stress tech job, struggling with low level inflammation for most of my life, I finally got really sick. But according to the endless doctors I visited, there was nothing wrong with me, even after months of tests and missed work and discomfort. When my illness finally mysteriously went away, I left tech, went to health-supportive culinary school, and then founded and managed a health-supportive food company in DC for about 5 years (Postmodern Foods).
Once I realized the most satisfying part of running a food business was watching my loyal customers gradually eat better, improve their lives, leave bad marriages, move up the ladder at work, and just generally look/feel/act better, I knew I wanted to develop systems that would scale larger than me, or my customer base in DC, or any one dietary paradigm. I realized over years of counseling people regularly, that no one diet works for all people - not even for the same person from hour to hour, day to day, or year to year. You see, our environment is constantly evolving (morning is sunny, evening is dark, for example), and our bodies are evolving both as a result of internal and external factors (e.g. I got in a fight with my spouse today).
I, and a small team, want to bring to market an app that will incorporate everything I've learned, both formally in the classroom at the world's best-known health-supportive culinary school (Natural Gourmet Institute), and in real-world practice for 5 years. I want to bring together eastern and western insights, like expansive/contractive and DNA analysis, to provide a world-class nutrition coaching app that will suggest ideal foods for you no matter where you are, respond to your biofeedback, adjust, provide robust tracking, and make it fun through social support and competitions!
Your contribution will not only provide you first-adopter access to the app once it's built, but it will also open the door to the most-affordable, most-predictive, most-customized healthy eating app on the market.
Plus, not only will you be helping yourself by eating better, you'll also be helping someone in need: for each yearly subscription, we'll give one away to someone who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford or access any type of nutritional coaching. If good nutrition is the cornerstone of good health, this is how we begin to level the playing field between the classes in our country, while also making a dent in health care costs: about 20% of the US GDP is spent on healthcare, about 80% of which is spent on chronic diseases which are preventable through better diet and lifestyle choices! Let's make those choices smarter, easier, and more accessible.

What We Need & What You Get
We need $50,000 to develop, market, and release Panacea! Most of this will be going to custom development work and integrations necessary to make a unique nutritional algorithm and allow integrations with food providers like Instacart.
For the interested: For $1 you can get access to all our latest updates, before the general public.
For the early bird: For $80 you can get free access to the app for 1 year after launch.
For the future user: For $100 you can get free access to the app for 1 year after launch.
For the early bird who's on board: For $180 you can get free access to the app for 1 year, including DNA testing results and analysis.
For the individual who's on board: For $200 you can get free access to the app for 1 year, including DNA testing results and analysis.
Family Pack: For $1,000 you can get free access to the app for 1 year, including DNA, for 6 people.
Office Pack: For $10,000 you can get free access to the app for 1 year, including DNA, for 55 people, and an optional in-person demo.
Superstar Pack: For $100,000 you can get free access to the app for 1 year, including DNA, for 520 people, and an in-person meeting and meal customized by our founder, Denise Hicks.
If we don't meet our entire fundraising goal, we'll figure out how to make the absolute best possible version of the app with a few corners cut!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Forearm Dumbbell:</strong></h3>
<p>The forearm dumbbell is the leading tool for training forearms.  This inexpensive user-friendly tool will revolutionize the way anyone trains their forearms.</p>
<p>To build stronger forearms for functional training, rehabilitation or looks this is the tool you will need to get the job done.</p>
<h3><strong>Story</strong></h3>
<p>While working as a carpenter I discovered that swinging a hammer all day will build very strong forearm muscles.  If you know any construction workers for that matter you will notice that they have very strong forearm muscles, just shake their hand.  The constant movement of swinging a hammer gave me the idea of designing a tool that can be used in the gym to train your forearms similar to the way you would swing a hammer. </p>
<p>The forearm dumbbell will increase the size and strength of your forearm muscles in a very simple and user friendly way.  </p>
<p>Just watch the videos and read the articles about forearm training on my website and you too will soon have strong forearms.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Matt Scudieri and I am from Haledon, New Jersey.  In the past I have worked as a Marine, Garbage man, Machinist, Manufacturing Engineer, Carpenter and Teacher of Special Education, History, GED and English as a Second Language.  Currently I am working as a Carpenter, Real Estate Agent and entrepreneur. </p>
<p>The project I am currently working on is the Forearm Dumbbell. The Forearm Dumbbell is a new and unique tool for training our forearms. </p>
<p>I have completed prototypes.             -           Facebook / social media pages.</p>
<p>Explainer Video.                                       -           Publishable training articles.</p>
<p>Website.                                                      -           Photos for marketing.</p>
<p>Zero debt.                                                  -           No investors / partners.</p>
<p>                A Provisional Patent that expires February 2020.</p>
<p>                A desire to succeed that is unstoppable.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have sunk every penny I earn into getting to the point we are with the forearm dumbbell and am nearly out of money.</p>
<p>We need funding for marketing, increasing our inventory and a non-provisional patent.</p>
<p>The cost for the Non-Provisional Patent Application process will be approximately $3,000 to $7,000.</p>
<p>Marketing cost will be approximately $3,000 to start.  </p>
<p>We will also need as much as we can get to increase our inventory.  Currently it costs $1,000 to make a fixed set of forearm dumbbells (6 pairs plus a rack).  This price will be greatly reduced when manufactured in volume.   And $100 to make a pair of adjustable dumbbell.</p>
<p>I would like to increase or inventory of fixed set of forearm dumbbells (6 pairs plus a rack) to 5 sets.  This will cost approximately $5,000</p>
<p>I would also like to increase our inventory of adjustable forearm dumbbells to 10 pairs.  This will cost approximately $1,000</p>
<p>Total cost of $12,000 to $16,000</p>
<p>I would appreciate every penny.  Currently I am in the process of making t-shirts and will be giving away one t-shirt to all donors who donate over $45.00.  Donations of over $100 will receive a pair of adjustable forearm dumbbells.</p>
<p>I am also willing to negotiate a portion of my company to investors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This product is the first tool in the fitness industry used to train the forearms in over a generation.  This is a great opportunity to change the fitness industry and the way athletes train their forearms. </p>
<p>I am very passionate about becoming a successful entrepreneur.  The reason why?  I never want to be broke again.  This is my first attempt to become an entrepreneur and have dedicated a lot of time educating myself about what it takes to be successful.  I have sunk nearly every penny into this and will not stop doing whatever it take to make this work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The fitness industry can be a little more risky then many industries.  There are a handful of mega corporations that dominate the business.  I don’t fear this but I do understand that in can make our goals a little more challenging.  Also the gym industry is dominated by big franchise companies that often do not allow independent owner operators to purchase equipment that is not authorized.  This can make it challenging to get our foot in the door. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Advice from entrepreneurs, industry experts, design, manufacturing and marketing experts is always greatly appreciated.   Please help spread the word to anyone in your network who is interested in investing in gym equipment, fitness, strength and conditioning or a challenge.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We want to bring the production of respirators<br/>and surgical masks back to the USA </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">
<a href=""https://serraex.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585350703/gz9x6hr4cuyeaybbox1m.png"" src=""""/></a><br/> </h3>
<p>In a crisis where the biggest trade partner of the US, China, is unable to provide the country with the necessary health environment for American citizens, we decided to take care of the people by producing maximum protection face masks ourselves.</p>
<div>
<p>As you might know, most of the healthcare items  that we use are produced in China. Unfortunately, though, you won’t get any new supplies from them because they need them for themselves and are not going to export anything for the next little while. So, before more and more people get infected with the virus because most hospitals and pharmacies have run out of face masks and won’t get new supplies, we have to step up and produce new supplies here and not wait for them to come.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584915954/hzb5sat7xqhanzkk5xlm.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Face mask production inside the USA</h3>
<p>FFP3/N99 masks (Filtering Face Piece) will be exclusively produced to protect people from the new deadly epidemic that is rapidly spreading all over the world. The masks offer protection from toxic and health-damaging dust, smoke and aerosols.</p>
<p>Facemasks with an <strong>FFP3/N99 </strong>protection level provide the <strong>best possible</strong> protection from breathing air pollution. With a total leakage maximum of 5% and the necessary protection from a minimum of 99% of particles up to 0.6μm in size, FFP3/N99 masks are capable of filtering toxic, radioactive and carcinogenic particles.</p>
<p>The masks offer protection to risk groups when dealing with viruses and bacteria such as coronavirus.</p>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584916091/aiefvoipa3ud9h6fzpdw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>We feel like we have a duty</h3>
<p>... to serve the country in this, and future, situations. We will have to help each other.</p>
<p>We want to buy special machines that are able to produce these FFP3/N99 masks, which will prevent you from getting infected by deadly diseases, toxic dust, radioactive and carcinogenic particles.</p>
<p>The machine is able to produce 30 masks per minute (1,800 per hour/43,200 per day ~<strong>1.300.000 per month and machine!</strong>). We have pre-contracts with the producer himself, and will order the first machine immediately upon reaching our goal of $142,500 (prices may vary in this campaign  because we are based in Austria, but we have already established a US company for the production process). The machine/s will be delivered as soon as possible to Los Angeles, California (Glendale) where the production process will start. We will order additional machines if our bonus orders exceed 300,000 masks to be able to deliver them as fast as possible. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584916166/hmk1pdiqmusymffvdgp9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/>Timeline</h3>
<p>As our project is set to 14 days, after collecting the necessary money we will immediately (as soon as we reach $140k) order the machine. The manufacturer needs 25 days for production and an additional ten days for delivery. The earliest shipping of the perks will therefore be mid/late April 2020.</p>
<p>Of course, the bonuses to the people who help us are granted in first row, taxes and shipping included. If you agree, your name will be written on our upcoming homepage as a Zero Hour supporter.<br/> </p>
<h3>Future</h3>
<p>Of course we will continue producing the masks for hospitals and doctors in the US for future use. But we also want to bring back following health goods production - as soon as we start shipping the first masks! </p>
<ul>
<li>Surgical Masks</li>
<li>​Latex Gloves</li>
<li>Sanitizer</li>
</ul> <p>It is time for us to help people out and take care of a big problem that is being<br/>underestimated in the media and on social media platforms.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","We want to bring the production of respiratorsand surgical masks back to the USA 
 

 
In a crisis where the biggest trade partner of the US, China, is unable to provide the country with the necessary health environment for American citizens, we decided to take care of the people by producing maximum protection face masks ourselves.

As you might know, most of the healthcare items  that we use are produced in China. Unfortunately, though, you won’t get any new supplies from them because they need them for themselves and are not going to export anything for the next little while. So, before more and more people get infected with the virus because most hospitals and pharmacies have run out of face masks and won’t get new supplies, we have to step up and produce new supplies here and not wait for them to come.



Face mask production inside the USA
FFP3/N99 masks (Filtering Face Piece) will be exclusively produced to protect people from the new deadly epidemic that is rapidly spreading all over the world. The masks offer protection from toxic and health-damaging dust, smoke and aerosols.
Facemasks with an FFP3/N99 protection level provide the best possible protection from breathing air pollution. With a total leakage maximum of 5% and the necessary protection from a minimum of 99% of particles up to 0.6μm in size, FFP3/N99 masks are capable of filtering toxic, radioactive and carcinogenic particles.
The masks offer protection to risk groups when dealing with viruses and bacteria such as coronavirus.


We feel like we have a duty
... to serve the country in this, and future, situations. We will have to help each other.
We want to buy special machines that are able to produce these FFP3/N99 masks, which will prevent you from getting infected by deadly diseases, toxic dust, radioactive and carcinogenic particles.
The machine is able to produce 30 masks per minute (1,800 per hour/43,200 per day ~1.300.000 per month and machine!). We have pre-contracts with the producer himself, and will order the first machine immediately upon reaching our goal of $142,500 (prices may vary in this campaign  because we are based in Austria, but we have already established a US company for the production process). The machine/s will be delivered as soon as possible to Los Angeles, California (Glendale) where the production process will start. We will order additional machines if our bonus orders exceed 300,000 masks to be able to deliver them as fast as possible. 


Timeline
As our project is set to 14 days, after collecting the necessary money we will immediately (as soon as we reach $140k) order the machine. The manufacturer needs 25 days for production and an additional ten days for delivery. The earliest shipping of the perks will therefore be mid/late April 2020.
Of course, the bonuses to the people who help us are granted in first row, taxes and shipping included. If you agree, your name will be written on our upcoming homepage as a Zero Hour supporter. 
Future
Of course we will continue producing the masks for hospitals and doctors in the US for future use. But we also want to bring back following health goods production - as soon as we start shipping the first masks! 

Surgical Masks
​Latex Gloves
Sanitizer
 It is time for us to help people out and take care of a big problem that is beingunderestimated in the media and on social media platforms. 
Support us to bring the production ofessential health goods back to the USA!

<p>During the spread of the Corona Virus, we quickly came up with places where we could infect ourselves in everyday life:<br/><br/>Starting with doorknobs, the handrails and door openers in buses and trains, the self service refrigerators or bread counters in the grocery store, when paying at card terminals or using the ATM, at traffic lights, mail boxes, trash cans, the light switch, or even the soap and disinfectant dispensers in the office or gym!<br/><br/>Therefore, we were looking for effective protection: In the absence of a proper solution, we quickly adopted it ourselves and created our patented 6.FINGER - which touches all the nasty things instead of your own hand.</p>
<p>Whats great about it: No additional refilling costs &amp; no annoying gloves to wear in summertime!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Now the only question left was:</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>How to store it absolute fail proof?</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587225924/gevauysbwhtdav8w4vgz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Our Goal - Your Goal!</h2>
<p>We researched - invented - developed - tested - improved - reinforced &amp; entered serial production already - self-funding 100% of our 6.FINGER | ""The Defender"" operation!<br/><br/>It is time to take bigger steps: We have proven that we can deliver without support!<br/><br/>But now let us climb the last summit together: Help us develop a fail-safe cover so that everyone can be sure that they will never experience cross-contamination, even if they use their 6.FINGER in dark situations (in low-light and no-light conditions)!</p>
<h2>How?</h2>
<p>We, the Inventors and Engineers, are busy keeping up the production of our 6.FINGER right now!</p>
<p>If we notice there is a demand for the Cover and we see the funds raising, we will immediately hire more Staff to take care of the logistical part - so we have time again to get back to the drawing table.</p>
<p>We will research and develop ""the Cover"": Make some Prototypes and put them under any stress condition you can imagine, until they break. This is the fun part for us :o)</p>
<p>In the next step we will improve the design again and repeat the process of improving&amp;testing until a rock-solid Cover comes along that proves to be durable and offering all the features we have in mind.</p>
<p>As soon as this step is done, we will craft the custom tooling's and start production - everything while in funding process!</p>
<p>So in the final end you definitely will receive a piece of hardware again, that will withstand any condition and last you maybe a life-time!</p>
<p><strong>Expect the same Standards as with our 6.FINGER ""the Defender"" Tool:</strong></p>

<p>Our German Engineers like to get the job done right, so expect us to deliver within a few weeks! For our 6.FINGER we just needed 4 weeks, from the drawing board until the in-Stock item.</p>
<h2>Specs to expect</h2>
<p><strong>Weight: </strong>maximum 25g (<i>0.88oz</i>) - but we try to slimline everything and get it down to around 15g (<i>0.5oz</i>)</p>
<p>Together with 38g (<i>1.3oz</i>) of our 6.FINGER | the Defender, you end up carrying only a total weight of 53g or just <i>1.86oz</i>!</p>

<h2>Why copper?</h2>
<p>A recent study from March 2020 made by the US Government has proofed that explicit the HCoV-19 Viruses are damaged on copper surfaces by various electro-chemical effects at the level of their DNA!</p>
<p>The reason they tested copper was because they expected this results, as ~20 studys in total have been made about copper in the past 20 years about this subject.</p>
<p>On dry copper, everything is decomposed after 10 - 30 minutes, not even DNA from the virus remains!<br/>And even under the worst possible conditions, in a wet and UV-free environment, the effects work well enaugh so that half of the viruses have died after 1 hour, and after 4 hours the entire DNA has been completely dissolved!<br/><br/><strong>Thus it can be safely said that a complete erasure of all viruses is ensured within 10 minutes to a maximum of 4 hours.</strong> This makes copper the best material to protect yourself against COVID-19! Also, many more studys proofed that copper is the only material with a significant effect on any kind of viruses, bacteria and microorganisms as it got tested against every major Disease out their!</p>
<p>At the same moment, Copper is the only official approved Material with an Effect on COVID-19 by this Study! No other metal got tested against COVID-19 in this study, and therefore no other Alloy can be safely determined to have a sufficient effect!</p>
<h2>Can you prove this claims? Sure!</h2>

<h2>You 're sure only copper helps: What about Silver, Stainless Steel or Brass?</h2>
<p>Simply said: Copper is chemically the most reactive Material of all of them. All others Alloys are less reactive - some of them by design! Even Copper Alloys, like Brass, containing high amounts of Copper do not even offer half of the performance compared to 100% copper!</p>
<p>Do your research and do not invest into cheap, ""diluted"" copper: Get the real deal and stick to the best performing material !</p>
<p>See this Study: Many materials got tested against the Murine Norovirus - a popular and quite nasty Virus!</p>

<h2>Copper vs. Brass</h2>
<p>Here's another Study, this time challenged by a way more complex organism than a virus: A Bacteria! Viruses are an easy task because of their small size, but Bacterias can withstand a whole lot more. And not just any Bacteria was tested: <i>Enterococcis</i> have a wide range of adoptions! Some of them are vancomycin-resistant like <i>Enterococci faecalis ATCC 51299!</i></p>
<p><strong><i>Nice side fact: Alloys containing even up to 89% Copper did performed significant less quick than 100% copper!</i></strong></p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
</div><div>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>1. Availability of Copper</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">One of our own major concerns is the availability of Copper material! Maybe it will take even the biggest suppliers in Europe some time to deliver our required materials, as the entire industry is turned up side down by this Epidemic!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Worst case that can happen?</i> A delay - but if that is fine for you, it is fine to us!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>2. What if the price for Copper will increase?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Another major concern is due to the Stock market, and the trade of copper, that the price for Copper will drastically increase. Since February, prices already went up by 30%, and there is no sign that this growth will stop anytime soon. We expect it to increase quicker, as the industry has demand for this Element, so we better like to hurry and offer a good deal!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Worst case because of this? </i>We will try to compensate for the costs with spending our profits. If that is not enaugh, we will pass the costs 1:1 to the you, the funder, and will ask you to more.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">If you are fine with this, no risk will be involved.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>3. What if we do not reach our funding Goal?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">You simply will get refunded. We are a legal German business and will not let your money disappear. If we would try to: Feel free to contact the German authorities, as they will prosecute every penny out of any Company trying to do shady stuff like this. Also, they will put us, the Executives, into jail ;)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Best part: It's free to take legal help in Germany. So if you are a foreigner, you do not need to spend your own money on court to receive legal help. Just contact the police or the public prosecutor of Berlin, and they will take care.</p>

<h2>Advantages of 6.FINGER</h2>
<ul>
<li>Protection against all kinds of viruses, bacteria and microorganisms!</li>
<li>active protection against the SARS-Corona Virus (COVID-19)</li>
<li>Does not inhibit the production of the required safety products for medicine. Thus, private users, the retail and wholesale trade, as well as medicine can be ADDITIONALLY equipped with 6.FINGERs!</li>
<li>small and effective</li>
<li>Mount onto retraction tether or keyring</li>
<li>Easy to maintain by the end user if surface treatment is required in the event of corrosion</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<ul>
<li>No printed invoice</li>
<li>No unnecessary product packaging</li>
<li>100% recycled shipping material</li>
<li>Short transport routes, produced regionally in Berlin</li>
<li>Durable - quality made product</li>
<li>100% recyclable and upcyclable raw material</li>

</ul>
<h2>How do we use it?</h2>
<p>We only recommend using <strong>GearKeeper USA</strong> products if you are looking for a retraction tether, based on our personal experience of more than 7 years. We also compared these with other high quality alternatives such as the Gerber Defender Tether: Due to the lack of a swivel, the Gerber Tether unfortunately is unsuitable for safe handling, which is why we can only recommend products with a swivel such as GearKeeper's!</p>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587228714/qhz8fbeo0bbhd7fjnuim.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<h2>Care instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clean regularly and if necessary, so that the proper function is ensured: It should be free of grease and particles. An ultrasonic bath like users of prescription glasses frequently own helps within 1-2 minutes without spending any effort. Another way is to gently wash it by hand with water &amp; soap, also alcohol such as Isopropanol is working fine. Do not treat with salts and other highly concentrated cleaners! Do not wash in the dishwasher!</li>
<li>Discoloration: Copper will corrode (oxidize) during use! This highly reactive property is the reason why it works so well against microorganisms! To ensure optimal functioning and to remain chemically active against microorganisms, the oxidation layer must be removed if necessary. Whenever the product has unsightly discoloration, brush them off with a copper wire brush, or use a classic metal sponge like commonly seen in the kitchen. Slight discoloration after the daily use is acceptable and does not affect the proper function.</li>
<li>Do not use on smart phones displays because of possible scratches by the copper. Instead, regularly clean and disinfect your touch interfaces!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hygiene Instructions</h2>
<p>Copper is not an absolute or sole protection, just an aid to reduce the fomite transmission of infectious organisms when operating facilities that are used by several people. It only offers another layer of protection.</p>
<p><strong>ATTENTION:</strong> <i>The 6.</i><i>FINGER</i><i><i> </i>must be stored in a suitable manner, e.g. stowed free hanging, or laying on a copper surface. Pockets in jackets and pants, or the outer layer of your clothing, are very likely to be contaminated when you store your 6th Finger on your person. To absolutely prevent any contamination, we are currently developing a suitable cover for your 6th Finger! Until we can offer this solution, take care not to contaminate your hands at the appropriate contact points by practicing a careful use until you achieved a safe sequence that your muscles can memorize.</i><br/><br/>Therefore, be sure to follow the instructions of the local authorities and comply with the important rules of conduct, which, with or without our 6.FINGER, are all part of a basic daily hygiene principle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic hygiene by washing your hands if necessary, e.g. before eating!</li>
<li>Refraining from touching the face and studying alternative methods</li>
<li>Only leave your own living quarters during an epidemic if necessary</li>
<li>Maintaining safety distances from people and material that are not urgently needed</li>
<li>Wear a face mask if directed to reduce airborne transmission</li>
<li>Regularly check again with the sources recommended by the authorities and with the authorities themselves in order to receive new instructions promptly and provide this information to people who can not help them self!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Safety notice</h2>

<p>Our journey with the 6.FINGER until here: Researching - Inventing - Developing - Testing - Improving - Reenforcing - Setting up Machines - crafting custom Tools and going into full production.</p>
</div></div>","Background story
During the spread of the Corona Virus, we quickly came up with places where we could infect ourselves in everyday life:Starting with doorknobs, the handrails and door openers in buses and trains, the self service refrigerators or bread counters in the grocery store, when paying at card terminals or using the ATM, at traffic lights, mail boxes, trash cans, the light switch, or even the soap and disinfectant dispensers in the office or gym!Therefore, we were looking for effective protection: In the absence of a proper solution, we quickly adopted it ourselves and created our patented 6.FINGER - which touches all the nasty things instead of your own hand.
Whats great about it: No additional refilling costs & no annoying gloves to wear in summertime!
Now the only question left was:
How to store it absolute fail proof?

Our Goal - Your Goal!
We researched - invented - developed - tested - improved - reinforced & entered serial production already - self-funding 100% of our 6.FINGER | ""The Defender"" operation!It is time to take bigger steps: We have proven that we can deliver without support!But now let us climb the last summit together: Help us develop a fail-safe cover so that everyone can be sure that they will never experience cross-contamination, even if they use their 6.FINGER in dark situations (in low-light and no-light conditions)!
How?
We, the Inventors and Engineers, are busy keeping up the production of our 6.FINGER right now!
If we notice there is a demand for the Cover and we see the funds raising, we will immediately hire more Staff to take care of the logistical part - so we have time again to get back to the drawing table.
We will research and develop ""the Cover"": Make some Prototypes and put them under any stress condition you can imagine, until they break. This is the fun part for us :o)
In the next step we will improve the design again and repeat the process of improving&testing until a rock-solid Cover comes along that proves to be durable and offering all the features we have in mind.
As soon as this step is done, we will craft the custom tooling's and start production - everything while in funding process!
So in the final end you definitely will receive a piece of hardware again, that will withstand any condition and last you maybe a life-time!
Expect the same Standards as with our 6.FINGER ""the Defender"" Tool:

Made in Berlin
 
ISO 9001 certified Production Facility's

We only use German Federal Environment Agency certified recycled paper for all our goods 

Our server & office runs entirely on Green-Energy!
 
How long to wait?
Best part of it: You don't need to wait 6 months for this campaign to finish!
Our German Engineers like to get the job done right, so expect us to deliver within a few weeks! For our 6.FINGER we just needed 4 weeks, from the drawing board until the in-Stock item.
Specs to expect
Weight: maximum 25g (0.88oz) - but we try to slimline everything and get it down to around 15g (0.5oz)
Together with 38g (1.3oz) of our 6.FINGER | the Defender, you end up carrying only a total weight of 53g or just 1.86oz!
Material: 100% Copper
Benefits: 100% Re- and Upcyclable Material
Features: Operate safely with just 1 Hand, even in no-light scenarios of complete darkness!
Climate Protection: We will incorporate a CO² Compensation for this product to 100% compensate for the damage we have done.
In addition, we will try to raise the bar to 200%: For every Product sold, 2 times the amount of CO² generated for production and shipping will be compensated!

Why copper?
A recent study from March 2020 made by the US Government has proofed that explicit the HCoV-19 Viruses are damaged on copper surfaces by various electro-chemical effects at the level of their DNA!
The reason they tested copper was because they expected this results, as ~20 studys in total have been made about copper in the past 20 years about this subject.
On dry copper, everything is decomposed after 10 - 30 minutes, not even DNA from the virus remains!And even under the worst possible conditions, in a wet and UV-free environment, the effects work well enaugh so that half of the viruses have died after 1 hour, and after 4 hours the entire DNA has been completely dissolved!Thus it can be safely said that a complete erasure of all viruses is ensured within 10 minutes to a maximum of 4 hours. This makes copper the best material to protect yourself against COVID-19! Also, many more studys proofed that copper is the only material with a significant effect on any kind of viruses, bacteria and microorganisms as it got tested against every major Disease out their!
At the same moment, Copper is the only official approved Material with an Effect on COVID-19 by this Study! No other metal got tested against COVID-19 in this study, and therefore no other Alloy can be safely determined to have a sufficient effect!
Can you prove this claims? Sure!
Link to our Website where you can see all the details of this Study

You 're sure only copper helps: What about Silver, Stainless Steel or Brass?
Simply said: Copper is chemically the most reactive Material of all of them. All others Alloys are less reactive - some of them by design! Even Copper Alloys, like Brass, containing high amounts of Copper do not even offer half of the performance compared to 100% copper!
Do your research and do not invest into cheap, ""diluted"" copper: Get the real deal and stick to the best performing material !
See this Study: Many materials got tested against the Murine Norovirus - a popular and quite nasty Virus!
Link to our Website where you can see all the details of this Study

Copper vs. Brass
Here's another Study, this time challenged by a way more complex organism than a virus: A Bacteria! Viruses are an easy task because of their small size, but Bacterias can withstand a whole lot more. And not just any Bacteria was tested: Enterococcis have a wide range of adoptions! Some of them are vancomycin-resistant like Enterococci faecalis ATCC 51299!
Nice side fact: Alloys containing even up to 89% Copper did performed significant less quick than 100% copper!

Copper vs. Silver
Wait, you said you got some Study proofing Silver is not sufficient enough!
Here you go, this time tested against the famous MRSA Bacteria:

Copper vs. Stainless Steel
This study suggest a difference between a dry and a wet copper surface, claiming <30 Minutes for complete inactivation of the Virus by alloys with high percentage of copper on a dry surface:

Risks & Challenges

1. Availability of Copper
One of our own major concerns is the availability of Copper material! Maybe it will take even the biggest suppliers in Europe some time to deliver our required materials, as the entire industry is turned up side down by this Epidemic!
Worst case that can happen? A delay - but if that is fine for you, it is fine to us!
2. What if the price for Copper will increase?
Another major concern is due to the Stock market, and the trade of copper, that the price for Copper will drastically increase. Since February, prices already went up by 30%, and there is no sign that this growth will stop anytime soon. We expect it to increase quicker, as the industry has demand for this Element, so we better like to hurry and offer a good deal!
Worst case because of this? We will try to compensate for the costs with spending our profits. If that is not enaugh, we will pass the costs 1:1 to the you, the funder, and will ask you to more.
If you are fine with this, no risk will be involved.
3. What if we do not reach our funding Goal?
You simply will get refunded. We are a legal German business and will not let your money disappear. If we would try to: Feel free to contact the German authorities, as they will prosecute every penny out of any Company trying to do shady stuff like this. Also, they will put us, the Executives, into jail ;)
Best part: It's free to take legal help in Germany. So if you are a foreigner, you do not need to spend your own money on court to receive legal help. Just contact the police or the public prosecutor of Berlin, and they will take care.


You still don´t know 6.FINGER?
Let us help you out:
Possible uses

No unnecessary product packaging
100% recycled shipping material
Short transport routes, produced regionally in Berlin
Durable - quality made product
100% recyclable and upcyclable raw material
Raw material without loss of value

How do we use it?
We only recommend using GearKeeper USA products if you are looking for a retraction tether, based on our personal experience of more than 7 years. We also compared these with other high quality alternatives such as the Gerber Defender Tether: Due to the lack of a swivel, the Gerber Tether unfortunately is unsuitable for safe handling, which is why we can only recommend products with a swivel such as GearKeeper's!

Care instructions

Clean regularly and if necessary, so that the proper function is ensured: It should be free of grease and particles. An ultrasonic bath like users of prescription glasses frequently own helps within 1-2 minutes without spending any effort. Another way is to gently wash it by hand with water & soap, also alcohol such as Isopropanol is working fine. Do not treat with salts and other highly concentrated cleaners! Do not wash in the dishwasher!
Discoloration: Copper will corrode (oxidize) during use! This highly reactive property is the reason why it works so well against microorganisms! To ensure optimal functioning and to remain chemically active against microorganisms, the oxidation layer must be removed if necessary. Whenever the product has unsightly discoloration, brush them off with a copper wire brush, or use a classic metal sponge like commonly seen in the kitchen. Slight discoloration after the daily use is acceptable and does not affect the proper function.
Do not use on smart phones displays because of possible scratches by the copper. Instead, regularly clean and disinfect your touch interfaces!

Hygiene Instructions
Copper is not an absolute or sole protection, just an aid to reduce the fomite transmission of infectious organisms when operating facilities that are used by several people. It only offers another layer of protection.
ATTENTION: The 6.FINGER must be stored in a suitable manner, e.g. stowed free hanging, or laying on a copper surface. Pockets in jackets and pants, or the outer layer of your clothing, are very likely to be contaminated when you store your 6th Finger on your person. To absolutely prevent any contamination, we are currently developing a suitable cover for your 6th Finger! Until we can offer this solution, take care not to contaminate your hands at the appropriate contact points by practicing a careful use until you achieved a safe sequence that your muscles can memorize.Therefore, be sure to follow the instructions of the local authorities and comply with the important rules of conduct, which, with or without our 6.FINGER, are all part of a basic daily hygiene principle:

Basic hygiene by washing your hands if necessary, e.g. before eating!
Refraining from touching the face and studying alternative methods
Only leave your own living quarters during an epidemic if necessary
Maintaining safety distances from people and material that are not urgently needed
Wear a face mask if directed to reduce airborne transmission
Regularly check again with the sources recommended by the authorities and with the authorities themselves in order to receive new instructions promptly and provide this information to people who can not help them self!

Safety notice
Copper has long been used in the jewellery industry with success. We do not know any dermatological facts so far whether contact with copper over a very long period of exposure may have a negative impact on the user.If symptoms of an allergy appear, stop using the product immediately and seek advice from a doctor. Please also contact us so that we can publicly clarify such incidents.The use for children is only recommended if they got instructed and supervised over a period of time and proved to handle the device properly without a doubt:

Only use the product as described!
No playful handling allowed!
Never leave it in your hand longer than necessary!
Do not perform a ""function test"" and, for example, lick the copper, or provoke contact with other mucous membranes!

We cannot predict whether the use for pregnant women will affect the unborn child and recommend to seek your doctors advice.One person should always use their own 6.FINGER: Sharing is only recommended between several people if the device could clean itself between the exchange without any doubt, e.g. a period of 4 hours has passed when possibly contaminated with COVID-19, or if it was cleaned, disinfected and not contaminated again before exchanging!
Like to spread the word?
Like always, the reason for fund raising is due the need to spread the word and get people aware of our unique solution. To get the job done quickly, please feel free to recommend us to your friends!

Our team saw a gap in the fitness industry for an effective and efficient all in one portable workout unit so we put our minds together and created The Go Trainer.

<h3>Brrrrr ! Winters coming, so it's time to get in the gym,  get on the treadmill, get on the turbo or just get in the car. Right ? Not anymore.</h3>
<p>Until now commuters too had one choice...you stay home, go in the car, by bus or train to be comfortable. Or you could use waterproof layers and fleece, or soft shells etc. But these still don't cope with bigger ranges of temperature and effort. But now there's the Torka 0-60.</p>
<p>And summer's great isn't it ? But for three out of four seasons there's still a great outdoors waiting for you to explore and play in. Whether you walk it, run in it, cycle through it, ski down it, climb up it or sail away on it.</p>
<p>The end result  of years of research  and development is ready for you now. Available this autumn the first sport jacket that keeps you the right temperature while you cycle, ski, run, climb, sail or walk the dog. And yes ! It keeps the rain off. All without taking off layers and adding them back on to cope with change in weather or the amount of heat you make, yourself.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Would you be willing to join us and bring this fantastic product to life ?</p>
<ul>
<li>We're raising £36,000 in the next month to bring the current prototypes into full production. Every  jacket costs £104 to make, meaning we'll spend  £20,800 in all for the 200 jackets promised in this round.</li>
<li>Next is protecting the Intellectual property, for which we have allotted £11,000</li>
<li>New patterns will cost £4,000  so we can go above the current range that we already have, of Small to Extra Large. That is enough for around 7 out of 10 adults but we want it available for all.  Then it will be available in Men's and Women's fit, and of course childrens' sizes too.</li>
<li>There's a good chance with economies of scale now, we'll be able to write new patterns for city and go to work wear versions too, if there is any surplus to that £4,000</li>
<li>The good news is that none of that money needs to go in our pockets. I still earn my living as a physiotherapist and Sue has her own business too. All the money raised this time goes into the project. Of course we want to make a living from it in the future. But we're not in a rush. We have time to get it right.</li>
<li>There are fantastic bargains for early birds...  as an established brand this will retail at £279 as it massively out performs waterproof and breathables, fleece and soft shell combinations, and is far more convenient. So you no longer have to carry and stow surplus gear.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We aim to transform the way people dress when they head for the great outdoors</p>
<ul>
<li>It's like the electric bike revolution that lets people exercise more, not less. Torka's 0-60 allows you to get out more, so you can commute to work and not get there in a sweat, take part in events or train all year round. It makes even the worst weather comfortable to train or exercise in.</li>
<li>Toward the end of the video you'll see real people who have been testing it. We don't want you to take our word for it. These folks have been using it for many months now and for them it's standing the test of time. It can for you too.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've been working on this for  a couple of years now. We see this as a disruptor to the outdoor clothing industry. So there are some risks</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people who like the outdoors, have bought into the "" waterproof and breathable"" model. They're used to putting on more layers, taking them off ( again ) and stowing or carrying the extra (again). People do  expect it, BUT they don't yet know what they don't know.</li>
<li>So what we have is as much an  education challenge as a manufacturing project.</li>
<li>Fashion. People like to look and dress like their heroes in sport, and we can't afford to sponsor those kinds of stars. So we need to do this differently and that's a risk and a challenge</li>
<li>It's a funny thing. The one real criticism we have heard is that the jacket is a little bulky. (The material combo is half an inch thick) The same people will put on a fleece and a waterproof... which is you've  guessed it, about half an inch thick.  So it's helping people change their perception. The layering concept has been around for a long time now, and it still doesn't work. So we have to change people's thinking. There's a challenge.</li>
<li>What we need to do to solve this is make a jacket that performs so well that it's irresistible.</li>
<li>Then tell them about it. Probably more than once.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you know someone who could help us. Perhaps you know a rising star in cycling, cross country running, track athletics, sailing, climbing or skiing. In the long run we will work with well known stars, as it will help reach more people. In the meantime we can work with rising stars who will use our gear, but don't need a big fee to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask friends, colleagues and club members to get the word out, and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>Please prompt  them to use the Indiegogo share tools !</li>
</ul>

<h3>About our company</h3>
<p>Triple W’s mission is to empower people with incontinence to live without worries.  Triple W develops DFree®, the first wearable device to predict when you need to go to the toilet.  DFree’s sensor uses ultrasound to continuously monitor your bladder and sends notification to your phone when your bladder is almost full so you know when to go resulting in less “accidents.”  The device is designed to not only help people with incontinence improve quality of life and enable independence, but to also help reduce the burden for the caregivers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help us launch the next generation sensor</h3>
<p>We launched the first generation sensor in 2017 which has been used by people with urinary incontinence and in over 500 senior care facilities in US, Europe and Japan.  Our new sensor for urinary incontinence will be smaller and wireless!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $1M to manufacture and get the product to market this year</li>
<li>For backers, we will provide early bird discount which is 40% off MSRP</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Incontinence affects many people</h3>
<p>The device is designed to not only help people with incontinence improve quality of life and enable independence, but to also help reduce the burden for the caregivers.</p>
<p>It can help millions of elderly and disabled people who suffer from incontinence every day.  We believe that having control of your senses is the key to independence and living your life to the fullest.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Challenge</h3>
<p>For those people suffering from urinary incontinence, there are very few options to help mitigate their problem.  Current options include wearing adult diapers, taking medications or going through surgery, none of which are compelling.  We believe that our sensor technology can help these people regain their confidence and dignity.  Since there are no devices like DFree, we need backings of people who believe in our vision to make it a reality.  </p>

<h3>Why we are on Indiegogo?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>First we developed an App that works 
and put that on the market for free. <a href=""http://www.app2find.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>App2Find</a>has been downloaded nearly 500.000 times and is the most popular (100% free) app to follow friends and 
family. App2Find is tested and proved itself for several years, so we know what you want when it comes to finding your lost precious family members and items. When we were sure of that, we started to research, develop and design Tool2Find. We eventually built a prototype, tested it, created our own secured server and produced the first 
samples. All done by our selves, using our own resources and own time. For specific technological things we of course hired experienced people to help us make it work.<br/><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1102762/files/20141217074944-too.png?1418831384"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>
<p>Now Tool2Find has finished development and testing and we want to give you the opportunity to purchase a family product without 
you being the test-subject. After running our campaign, we'll be heading into our first production and deliver the Tool2Find to you, without delay.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1102631/files/20141217063738-timeline.png?1418827058"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Our target: one month of Indiegogo for fund raising, one month for the moulding, one month for 
production and give us one month to spare (just in case) and we'll 
deliver without delay after delay. Tool2Find is here
 and it works!<br/></p>

<h3>
<br/>Too good to be true?<br/>
</h3>In the previous years we got a lot of 'complaints' that App2Find shouldn't be free, as it is too good for that. Nothing is for free... except App2Find.<br/>Ok, we miscalculated the development and the costs of App2Find and never thought that it would come to half a million downloads. But that helped us to get the guts to dive into the deep and develop Tool2Find. <br/><br/><p>App2Find is and stays free in its full usage (no light version or limitations), and we will not sell or share your location with others. <br/></p>
<p>Tool2Find has a 1-year global data coverage included, the next year it will be € 45,- for another full year of global data usage. We'll also offer extras like extra use of Panic-mode, location update etc. But you will get enough play time with all functions before we ask a small donation (mostly only needed in the second year if you really like to press buttons).<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1102632/files/20141217063835-lovely.png?1418827115"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>The geek part:</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>For those
who are interested in specifications and facts we have made an overview of
Tool2Find its power and capabilities.</p>
<p>What can you
expect of Tool2Find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location
     update every # minutes (depends on the preference)</li>
<li>Location
     on demand</li>
<li>Panic
     Mode ( a 5 minute real time tracking  )</li>
<li>Set up
     to 4 safezones (geofence)</li>
<li>Up to 1
     meter accuracy (in ideal situation)</li>
<li>Theft
     alarm</li>
<li>Child-Lock</li>
</ul>
<p><b><br/>Panic Mode</b> <br/>
You're walking with your son in a parc and suddenly you lose your son out of
sight. In these moments seconds are important and that is why we thought of the
""Panic Mode"". It gives you a 5 minute high speed location update so
that you can find your son back in seconds/minutes.</p>
<p><b><br/>Safezone<br/></b></p>
<p>Ease your mind with a extra pair of
eyes. You can set up safezones a.k.a. geofence which gives you a digital fence.
In this safezone your child or whoever you wish to keep safe can walk freely
without you being worried where they are. If they walk outside this safezone
you will receive a alarm message on your phone and also their current location will
be updated right away.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1102630/files/20141217063715-app.png?1418827035"" src="""" style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"",Helvetica,sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;'/></p>
<p><br/>Tool2Find is
made with only the best components to guaranty a high-end product. With a
solded SIM, sensitive GPS antenna, GSM antenna, SIM900 module, gyroscope sensor
and many other components. These components make it possible for the Tool2Find
to locate whatever you want. <br/></p>
<p>With a battery of 400 mAh you have the possibility to use Tool2Find for about 20 hours (depending on the settings). The battery can be charged with the included power cable within 1,5 hours.<br/></p>Just to be clear: Tool2Find is ready, so no long development periods but simply the production. That is where we need you for. Support us by buying your own Tool2Find.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>You need to know</h3>
<p>Like all other products, ours is best. But we want to be honest and also tell you the limitations.</p>
<p>If you are in a bunker, the Tool does not work. <br/>You'll need GPS (satellite) contact and GPRS (cellular connection). The more you are in an open field, the better the GPS works, and will allow you to locate up to 1,5 meter specific. <br/>But, of course we did think of this too. If no GPS available (e.g. inside) Tool2Find switches from GPS to location through the cellular towers. This makes it less accurate, but it is better to look in an area than somewhere in the world. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>GPRS (data
connection) is mostly not a problem, but for sending data back and forth to your

<p>Even GPS-signals are mostly good outside, but buildings can mirror the signal and confuse a little. No big problem, but that means your Tool can be some meters away from the location.

Luckily we thought of it and enable you to change the update frequency as you like, and if you have a slow update speed, just click one button to locate (saving lost of battery, frustration and most importantly your loved one).</p>

""Over 2000 children go
missing every day, and that’s not all...Pets run off… Elderly and mentally
disabled people get lost and how many times do we forget where we parked our
car?""This is all history now. Tool2Find is a small GPS
device that helps you find it all; your children, grandfather, dog, car and
even your luggage. The Tool works independent with its own GPS and GPRS
connection, no need for other people's smartphones to find what you are looking
for.


Tool2Finds unique silicone bumper makes the device multi applicable, protects
it and makes it look and feel great.
Unlike other trackers, the Tool2Find isn’t
a device depending on a Bluetooth connection, but rather uses GPS and GSM. Tool2Find is accurate, stand-alone and with it's small size you won't even know you're wearing it. 


We designed the Tool2Find to solve a lifelong and serious problem: To 
find whomever and whatever you've lost, back in an instant. Research has
 shown that on a global scale, thousands of children go missing 
everyday. Pets leave home and never return and your elderly suffering 
from dementia, wander off alone leaving carers in panic when doing so. 

Why we are on Indiegogo?

First we developed an App that works 
and put that on the market for free. App2Findhas been downloaded nearly 500.000 times and is the most popular (100% free) app to follow friends and 
family. App2Find is tested and proved itself for several years, so we know what you want when it comes to finding your lost precious family members and items. When we were sure of that, we started to research, develop and design Tool2Find. We eventually built a prototype, tested it, created our own secured server and produced the first 
samples. All done by our selves, using our own resources and own time. For specific technological things we of course hired experienced people to help us make it work.
Now Tool2Find has finished development and testing and we want to give you the opportunity to purchase a family product without 
you being the test-subject. After running our campaign, we'll be heading into our first production and deliver the Tool2Find to you, without delay.
Our target: one month of Indiegogo for fund raising, one month for the moulding, one month for 
production and give us one month to spare (just in case) and we'll 
deliver without delay after delay. Tool2Find is here
 and it works!

Second bumper: attachment clip (included with every perk).
What do you get when you go for a Perk?- The device Tool2Find in black with it's original orange bumper to protect the Tool and help it become more waterproof. - An integrated simcard including 365 days of global (roaming) data*- A second (orange) bumper which enables you to hand the Tool on your neck with a lanyard, attach it to your belt and clip it on to something.- A clip for attaching to your second bumper to wear it where you want.- A lanyard, so you can actually hang it around your neck.- A special USB cable for charging and if necessary upgrade the firmware.- A quick install guide to be able to start directly.- A lifetime gratitude by placing your name on our Hall Of Fame* See www.Tool2Find.com to find out which 135 countries are included.


Is my location safe with you?
We'll prolong our promise to not sell data and not to share your locations with anyone (family, friends or governments) nor we will spam you with advertisements. Our servers are renewed and encrypted, we don't log locations-data and our servers are located only in The Netherlands with a great privacy legislation. NSA can't find you with our App or Tool as long as you don't give them permission specifically by inviting them as your 'parent' (which we don't advise to do).

Tool2Find in quick buzzes:
# Geo-fence: virtual eyes will stop you from worrying.# Spot-alarm: quick
(App-controlled) virtual perimeter.# SOS-button: when
your loved one is in need of help.# Panic mode: live tracking in case of
emergency.# Location on
demand: one click to request the current location of your loved one.# Power saving
mode: save battery life.
# Child lock:
overruling on/off-button and reset-button.
# Cross platform use (Smartphone, Tablet, Laptop, Computer).
# Customize the update speed.
# Location display
on map or by Augmented Reality.
# World wide coverage.
# No periodic contract
necessary.# Simcard included.# Global data usage included for one year.# Secured and
private data communication.# No spam, no
advertisement, no unwanted followers and no sales of e-mail!# No data history storage (no Big Brother!).# A Dutch design. # Attachment accessories included. # Works with our free App2FInd (Android and iOS) but also on your PC (web-based).


Too good to be true?
In the previous years we got a lot of 'complaints' that App2Find shouldn't be free, as it is too good for that. Nothing is for free... except App2Find.Ok, we miscalculated the development and the costs of App2Find and never thought that it would come to half a million downloads. But that helped us to get the guts to dive into the deep and develop Tool2Find. App2Find is and stays free in its full usage (no light version or limitations), and we will not sell or share your location with others. 
Tool2Find has a 1-year global data coverage included, the next year it will be € 45,- for another full year of global data usage. We'll also offer extras like extra use of Panic-mode, location update etc. But you will get enough play time with all functions before we ask a small donation (mostly only needed in the second year if you really like to press buttons).

The geek part:


For those
who are interested in specifications and facts we have made an overview of
Tool2Find its power and capabilities.
What can you
expect of Tool2Find:

Location
     update every # minutes (depends on the preference)
Location
     on demand
Panic
     Mode ( a 5 minute real time tracking  )
Set up
     to 4 safezones (geofence)
Up to 1
     meter accuracy (in ideal situation)
Theft
     alarm
Child-Lock

Panic Mode 
You're walking with your son in a parc and suddenly you lose your son out of
sight. In these moments seconds are important and that is why we thought of the
""Panic Mode"". It gives you a 5 minute high speed location update so
that you can find your son back in seconds/minutes.
Safezone
Ease your mind with a extra pair of
eyes. You can set up safezones a.k.a. geofence which gives you a digital fence.
In this safezone your child or whoever you wish to keep safe can walk freely
without you being worried where they are. If they walk outside this safezone
you will receive a alarm message on your phone and also their current location will
be updated right away.

Tool2Find is
made with only the best components to guaranty a high-end product. With a
solded SIM, sensitive GPS antenna, GSM antenna, SIM900 module, gyroscope sensor
and many other components. These components make it possible for the Tool2Find
to locate whatever you want. 
With a battery of 400 mAh you have the possibility to use Tool2Find for about 20 hours (depending on the settings). The battery can be charged with the included power cable within 1,5 hours.Just to be clear: Tool2Find is ready, so no long development periods but simply the production. That is where we need you for. Support us by buying your own Tool2Find.

You need to know
Like all other products, ours is best. But we want to be honest and also tell you the limitations.
If you are in a bunker, the Tool does not work. You'll need GPS (satellite) contact and GPRS (cellular connection). The more you are in an open field, the better the GPS works, and will allow you to locate up to 1,5 meter specific. But, of course we did think of this too. If no GPS available (e.g. inside) Tool2Find switches from GPS to location through the cellular towers. This makes it less accurate, but it is better to look in an area than somewhere in the world. 

GPRS (data
connection) is mostly not a problem, but for sending data back and forth to your
Tool, you need a connection with any cellular around the world (in one of the
135 covered country).
Even GPS-signals are mostly good outside, but buildings can mirror the signal and confuse a little. No big problem, but that means your Tool can be some meters away from the location. This is not something we can fix without distorting all buildings and shoot a couple of hundreds satellites in to the orbit. Trees and clouds can cloud the view also, but have much less influence than buildings and bunkers.
If you are paranoid and you really want to use the full follow options (check the geeky part), which is possible of course, with Tool2Find you are in charge the battery life will go down significantly. Same thing goes for your smart phone, but hay, this can't be new right? Luckily we thought of it and enable you to change the update frequency as you like, and if you have a slow update speed, just click one button to locate (saving lost of battery, frustration and most importantly your loved one).

Military is a hectic life
Overseas, at sea, or even home - gift giving is a struggle (for 91% of males)
Finding the right gift, at the right price, and delivering on time is near impossible






Introducing Pelorus.



Pelorus.me is the first military-only automated gifting service.
Our mission is to help service men and women give great gifts to their loved ones.  Pelorus provides superior gift selection, automated purchases, and guaranteed on-time delivery on behalf of our Members.

Build, Budget, Gift.





Pelorus Members register for free at www.Pelorus.me.  Once activated, our Members build profiles for their family and friends.



Gifting occasions are selected for each profile, and budgets are set for each occasion.



Our Gifters then analyze each profile, find the perfect gift within budget, make the purchase, and arrange on-time delivery - all from you!


Giftee Profiles.







Pelorus Giftee Profiles are designed to help us find and deliver great gifts on your behalf.

Members answer a series of questions about their Giftee, tell us what categories worked in the past, and provide intimate details shared between the member and their Giftee.

We are obsessed with perfect gifting.  It's our passion.  And delivering happiness is what keeps us going.  Our profiling methods are constantly improving with the help of collegiate Professors and market experts - we're good at this already, and we're only going to gift better. 

What are Gifters?



Pelorus Gifters are real people who love to give, gift, and shop.

Each Gifter analyzes Giftee profiles to find the right gift.  Age, gender, relationship, lifestyle, and occasions are just some of the considerations that go into our gift decision process.

Our Gifters LOVE what they do, and it shows with each delivered gift.   

The Fine Print.






Pelorus gifts are always purchased within our Member's budget - to include the shipping.

Gifts are purchased automatically using the Member's preferred payment method.  Each gift selected is subject to a 24-hour Member review period (via email).  Our Member may decline any gift within the review period.

A $5 service fee is applied to each gift.  This service fee covers: operating expenses, Gifter incentive, and a $1 charitable contribution to the Fisher House Foundation.








Pelorus Does Not.


Pelorus DOES NOT use an algorithm to select gifts - EVERY gift is selected by a real life human.

Pelorus DOES NOT deliver late - Gifts arrive on time or it's free.

Pelorus DOES NOT pad prices - Gifts are purchased at advertised prices, always.

Pelorus DOES NOT take the credit - The gift is from our Member, not our company.

<p><span>At MXEL our goal has always been to provide the highest quality products in doses that actually produce results. In the interest of increasing profit margins, a lot of companies cut down on active ingredients as some can cost more than $750 a kilo. Since supplements can’t contain pharmaceutical grade ingredients, we have to increase the quantities of each ingredients, which increases the number of pills user need to take to get the desired effect.  </span></p>
<p>For example, Modafinil, which helps increase cognitive and focusing abilities just like MXEL Booster does, only a 100mg pill is required. To get similar effects, we need about 2,000mg (2g) of ingredients. Which means 4 pills instead of one tiny one. Of course, the cost of two Modafinil, assuming your doctor will agree to prescribe them to you, will cost you 24$ a pill, instead of 3$ per doses for MXEL Booster.</p>We are on Indiegogo because we need to acquire a automated pill machine with bottling function.  This will help us meet our production demand, reduce cost and ensure our production remain in North America.  The campaign will also give backers and existing customers the opportunity to buy MXEL supplements at an amazing discount, up to 85 % for Super Early Birds<br/>

</div><br/></div>","At MXEL our goal has always been to provide the highest quality products in doses that actually produce results. In the interest of increasing profit margins, a lot of companies cut down on active ingredients as some can cost more than $750 a kilo. Since supplements can’t contain pharmaceutical grade ingredients, we have to increase the quantities of each ingredients, which increases the number of pills user need to take to get the desired effect.  
For example, Modafinil, which helps increase cognitive and focusing abilities just like MXEL Booster does, only a 100mg pill is required. To get similar effects, we need about 2,000mg (2g) of ingredients. Which means 4 pills instead of one tiny one. Of course, the cost of two Modafinil, assuming your doctor will agree to prescribe them to you, will cost you 24$ a pill, instead of 3$ per doses for MXEL Booster.We are on Indiegogo because we need to acquire a automated pill machine with bottling function.  This will help us meet our production demand, reduce cost and ensure our production remain in North America.  The campaign will also give backers and existing customers the opportunity to buy MXEL supplements at an amazing discount, up to 85 % for Super Early Birds

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I asked myself a couple of questions some years ago while working out, ""Why is it people don't wipe their sweat and germs off the exercise bench?  What in the world makes them think someone wants to put their head and shoulders on a soiled workstation?""   In a poll taken by Fitnessmagazine.com in April 2013 almost 40% of those polled said, they do not wipe the exercise bench down after a workout.   In 2016 at least <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/236123/us-fitness-center--health-club-memberships/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">57 million</a> people across the U.S. had a paid gym or fitness center membership, so that means, there are a whole lot of people leaving soiled benches behind.  My intention is to stay as far away from someone else's germs as possible.  Of course, we can't totally avoid germs while working out because studies have shown that fitness centers/gyms have more germs than a public toilet.  I've never liked the idea of contacting someone else's sweat or germs while working out, that's why I invented D Bench Jockey.  D Bench Jockey comes between the user and the sweat and germs left behind on an exercise bench. <i> <strong> </strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>***</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>D Bench Jockey</strong> </i><strong><i>has a patented handle which allows you to place it directly on a soiled bench and after working out you can safely pick D Bench Jockey up and move on to the next exercise without ever making direct contact with the soiled side of the towel or the exercise bench.</i> </strong> Help me make this kind of protection available for anyone anywhere who works out and is tired of this nagging and potentially infectious situation.  D Bench Jockey also has a <strong>secondary use. </strong> I've actually used it to cover movie theater seats and the airplane seats for me and my wife.  Yes, I placed it directly on the head of the seat and was then able to lay back and comfortably enjoy my movie/plane ride knowing my head was protected by D Bench Jockey.  During a test by Microbac Laboratories in Kentucky in 2013 D Bench Jockey was able to absorb a significant amount of moisture before soaking through to the other side.  Here is a facebook post from D.L. Stanley of Memphis, TN about D Bench Jockey:  ""<strong>D Bench Jockey is the best thing since sliced bread. I use it religiously! There is no need to worry about someone else's germs from the gym when you use D Bench Jockey. I love it and would recommend it to anyone whose workout regimen requires a lot of sweat. Kudos to D Bench Jockey!</strong>""</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> Right now we have a limited number of these specially made towels available and ready for shipping.   A towel of this quality would normally sell anywhere from $25.00 upwards to about $60.00.  We want you to have the same protection I have since I've been using it for a while.  If you want to see this product in various colors, (right now it's only available in black) and if you want to see this product made available all over the world you can purchase you can purchase D Bench-Jockey for the special Indiegogo price of $13.00 for one, $24.00 for two or $30.00 for three, plus shipping.  We understand that some people workout several days a week and we wanted to make it easy for you to have a clean towel for each workout.  D Bench Jockey is washable so it can be used over and over again.  We have approx 1,400 available for this Indiegogo campaign.  <strong>Mailouts will be 1 to 3 days after receiving payment.  </strong>When<strong> </strong>you purchase at least one Bench Jockey, you will also be able to vote and help pick the next color or colors for our next order.*  If you like D Bench Jockey but are not ready to make a purchase you can still vote for the next color or colors by supporting this project with at least a $5.00 donation.*  You can always donate whatever amount you desire if $5.00 is not a desirable amount. The money used will be for inventory, marketing, and shipping.  The motto of D Bench Jockey is, ""<strong><i>Cover it up and protect yourself</i>.</strong>""</p>
<p>*How many new colors we have next depends on the total amount contributed to this project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will benefit not only yourself but countless others.  You will not make contact with their germs and they will not make contact with yours.  Fungus, germs, and sweat are not going anywhere, so that means as users we need to take as many safety precautions as we can.  D Bench Jockey allows you the freedom to workout on an exercise bench you might normally pass over simply because it is soiled.  In a limited test run of D Bench Jockey, many customers testify how easy and convenient D Bench Jockey made their workout.  It doesn't fit over all the exercise equipment but it fits over most of them.  Workout with D Bench Jockey and feel safe and secure knowing that you are not directly contacting anybody else's sweat, and germs!  No more wiping, no more spraying, no more leaving your workout area to retrieve those products to clean the bench.  Remember, ""<i><strong>Cover it up and protect yourself.</strong></i>""</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is always a struggle when introducing an entirely new product to the public, but once you see how efficiently and easily D Bench Jockey works to separate you from the sweat and germs left behind on an <strong><i>exercise bench, airplane seat</i>, <i>theater seat </i>or <i>any other seat or chair</i> </strong>you don't your head to touch, you will be impressed.  With your help and my perseverance, we can and we will see this product in mass production and circulation in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>About six months ago Mona Rocchi, a tremendously energetic female entrepreneur in Sri Lanka and I sat down to discuss the idea of starting a trend for healthy food and drinks in Sri Lanka using sustainable produce harvested in the country. We experimented for a while with recipes and included a large portfolio of Mediterranean dishes you can cook in this part of the world using a pizza oven to avoid cooking with oil and fat. The products are there, a large number of customers have enjoyed them and unanimously agree on the quality and taste. But the key to bringing the product out into the market is the concept of a fruit juice and food glass bar drive through. That is the real innovation in our model. People need to see what they get in this country and the glass bar offering our unique products with an attached pizza oven is what will make a difference!</p>
<p>Mona is Sri Lankan and has been in the health and food industry for over a decade. She has been a pioneer and originally set up Sri Lanka´s first beauty treatment company, which became a tremendous financial success. She has strong business acumen and is passionate about campaigning for people to live a healthy lifestyle - by enjoying what they eat and drink.</p>
<p>Rohith Delilkhan is of Sri Lankan origin, too, born in the UK and educated in Germany and Switzerland. He has worked as an advisor to major hotel groups, small restaurants and airlines, and run small businesses as start-up CEO until they were successful in Singapore, the Middle East and Switzerland.</p>
<p>We believe that our project is a vital step towards rethinking food and drink in a growing developing economy, where the young and the discerning are willing to search for alternatives to fast food. We believe there is tremendous potential for juice bars and healthy breakfast options, which we will offer from street-side drive-thru locations for people on their way to work in the morning to pick up at prices which are affordable but will allow us to make a profit with the business. Sri Lankans as eaters are discerning and if we can get the early adopters on board we are confident we can create a trend that will revolutionize the way people think about food and drinks in the country.</p>
<p>From our first restaurant in Battaramula, which we have taken over, to a franchise business is not a long way away -  in the context of Sri Lanka, and we want to make this an island-wide trend, as the cost of setting up drive-thru fruit juice and food bars with an adjacent pizza oven (in which all manner of food can be cooked without oil) is fairly reasonable.</p>
<p>If you as contributors to this project are willing to help us make it happen, you will be able  not only to recover your investment but also to help build a healthier lifestyle for people who have forgotten what it means to eat good food. This is a for-profit business, and we are confident about the financials involved, but we also feel it is a major contribution to society. Without your help we cannot do this as banks in Sri Lanka do not lend money and finance companies unless they have fixed assets to the value of the commitment required, which we do not. We have used our own funds to build and pilot the concept until we now have a working prototype, but to go the next mile we need support.</p>
<h3><strong>Funding Requirements &amp; Returns</strong></h3>
<p>The funding we require is USD 180,000. What will it be used for?</p>
<p>We will take over the equipment and facilities (including pizza oven and two fully operational kitchens, as well as a long-term lease agreement of the premises, a beautiful old colonial building at a guaranteed rental rate for the first property, This takeover also includes the licenses, such as operating and alcohol licenses for a restaurant, which we need to finance. The cost for this USD 120,000.</p>
<p>We need a further sum of USD 20,000 to pave the drive-thru area and redo the drainage and wiring system to the property, and a further USD 12,000 for the full glass drive-thru fruit juice and food bar. Another USD 20,000 will be used to replicate the same in Marine Drive Colombo, for just a fruit-juice and healthy pizza and salad drive-thru without a full operating restaurant as in Battaramula, which is the showcase piece. Do we need a full restaurant? Yes, in the context of Sri Lanka you need a home for your franchise as people want to see how something materializes and image plays a vital role in building a brand. The restaurant will be the mainstay for our investment recovery. We will use USD 8,000 for our marketing campaign from your funds. As for ourselves as entrepreneurs, we will take on paying the staff, funding our own costs for the first year until the business is profitable, so that the enterprise can become a success.  We expect to invest about USD 30,000 ourselves for that, besides the USD 45,000 we have already used of our own funds for prototyping (recipes, equipment investments, production and tasting by customers).</p>
<p>The operation is expected to make around USD 9,000-10,000 a month with the main and one franchise location. Once the model is successful we will offer strictly regulated franchises to others to buy into, which we reckon will be within 24 months. Within 4 years we expect to IPO the business in Sri Lanka. </p>
<p>Your investment will be injected into the business as a private placement (collectively) and we will pledge the license we have for alcohol, which is worth around USD 200,000 at the current going rate in Sri Lanka for your contribution - it is impossible to get new alcohol licenses for restaurants today (and for the past 12 months as well). Should the venture not be successful for any reason we will transfer the alcohol license we have to someone else and repay you from the returns.</p>
<p>However, we are confident this will be a successful venture and you can cash out at a return of 20% IRR after two years or wait for IPO, at which time we will convert your contribution at your investment plus about 20% p.a. IRR minimum value of your placement. So that means if you put in USD 100 to our project it will be worth USD 200 in shares when we go for an IPO. These you can sell and exit or you can retain and continue your journey with us.</p>

<h3>Project Impact</h3>
<p>Affordable good food needs to be eaten to be appreciated. It is available in Sri Lanka if you purchase fresh produce from the market and use traditional recipes from Sri Lanka and the Mediterranean. They are a joy to eat and people will understand that healthy doesn´t mean limitations but expansion of horizons.</p>
<p>We want to see less diabetes, more fun with dining, less obesity as a result in Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>We want to become the hip company that turned the trend and it is with our concept of drive-thru juice and food  bar that we will do it and the plethora of recipes we have tested.</p>
<p>Your contribution is towards a great cause, but it will be a profitable one so you can not only make something out of this venture but also do something good for a society.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main risk we face is that people will prefer unhealthy food to healthy food, even if it tastes better. It is critical that we can get our early adopters into the equation. For this reason we decided to have the restaurant in an area where people are amongst the trendsetters and early adopters.</p>
<p>A secondary challenge we face is that staff for the restaurant and food business as such are not easy to come by. But we have agreed with a training institution to take their staff and have our own staff trained by them in order for us to have access to manpower so we can expand.</p>
<p>Of course, a final risk is that something happens to us - but there are two us, both passionate about this business, and both in a position to carry on if one of us were no longer able to contribute for any reason.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>If you can contribute, great, if you can´t - this is how you can still help...</h3>
<p>Tell people what we, as local entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka, are trying to change as a trend in society. If we are successful here we can go to India and elsewhere in South Asia with our model.</p>

About six months ago Mona Rocchi, a tremendously energetic female entrepreneur in Sri Lanka and I sat down to discuss the idea of starting a trend for healthy food and drinks in Sri Lanka using sustainable produce harvested in the country. We experimented for a while with recipes and included a large portfolio of Mediterranean dishes you can cook in this part of the world using a pizza oven to avoid cooking with oil and fat. The products are there, a large number of customers have enjoyed them and unanimously agree on the quality and taste. But the key to bringing the product out into the market is the concept of a fruit juice and food glass bar drive through. That is the real innovation in our model. People need to see what they get in this country and the glass bar offering our unique products with an attached pizza oven is what will make a difference!
Mona is Sri Lankan and has been in the health and food industry for over a decade. She has been a pioneer and originally set up Sri Lanka´s first beauty treatment company, which became a tremendous financial success. She has strong business acumen and is passionate about campaigning for people to live a healthy lifestyle - by enjoying what they eat and drink.
Rohith Delilkhan is of Sri Lankan origin, too, born in the UK and educated in Germany and Switzerland. He has worked as an advisor to major hotel groups, small restaurants and airlines, and run small businesses as start-up CEO until they were successful in Singapore, the Middle East and Switzerland.
We believe that our project is a vital step towards rethinking food and drink in a growing developing economy, where the young and the discerning are willing to search for alternatives to fast food. We believe there is tremendous potential for juice bars and healthy breakfast options, which we will offer from street-side drive-thru locations for people on their way to work in the morning to pick up at prices which are affordable but will allow us to make a profit with the business. Sri Lankans as eaters are discerning and if we can get the early adopters on board we are confident we can create a trend that will revolutionize the way people think about food and drinks in the country.
From our first restaurant in Battaramula, which we have taken over, to a franchise business is not a long way away -  in the context of Sri Lanka, and we want to make this an island-wide trend, as the cost of setting up drive-thru fruit juice and food bars with an adjacent pizza oven (in which all manner of food can be cooked without oil) is fairly reasonable.
If you as contributors to this project are willing to help us make it happen, you will be able  not only to recover your investment but also to help build a healthier lifestyle for people who have forgotten what it means to eat good food. This is a for-profit business, and we are confident about the financials involved, but we also feel it is a major contribution to society. Without your help we cannot do this as banks in Sri Lanka do not lend money and finance companies unless they have fixed assets to the value of the commitment required, which we do not. We have used our own funds to build and pilot the concept until we now have a working prototype, but to go the next mile we need support.

Chances are you need regular help.</p><p> </p><p><i><strong>A Recipe For Disaster:</strong></i></p><p><i><strong>If we were having a conversation about this,</strong></i> we would advise you (with your doctor’s permission and endorsement) to start by simply counting your calories and being aware of the normal adult levels to give you a sense of making better food choices. Then, “step down” your daily caloric goal, week by week.</p><p>We can tell you about a free App for your Smartphone or computer to Count Calories easily to stay on-track.</p><p>Once your daily calories are at normal adult levels for a few weeks, begin restricting them further and start to follow the OOC Diet Success Plan(TM).  We can provide that to you - discuss please.</p><p>The normal calories consumed daily are as follows:  For women at 1,600 calories and for men at 2,200 calories daily.  Try and get there over time - then go lower.</p><p>BUT if you are eating the wrong foods and have leaky gut syndrome you will not optimize your weight loss results.  Get the right food choices and use our Approach to win.  Most folks who are obese are consuming in excess of 4,000 to 6,000 daily calories.</p><p>Combined with terrible food choices, no activity, poor gut health and it is a Recipe For Disaster.</p><p>Severely overweight or obese people should lose weight during our suggested “step down” period and the rate of weight loss should increase once they begin the OCC Diet Success Plan because it is based on sound principles. When incorporated for overcoming obesity also adopt these good habits:</p><p> </p><p>    We will inform you of the key foods to eat to stay full and healthy</p><p>    Eat whole foods only; avoid processed foods and junk foods</p><p>   AVOID: Soda drinks (diet and regular) and sugary drinks - they are your enemy</p><p>    Understand that FOUR Key Foods are Your ENEMY!  They are literally killing you and keeping the weight on.  Eliminate them and the weight starts to fly-off you.</p><p>    Generally eat all the fruits and veggies you like.  Unless you are diabetic then special foods need consideration.</p><p>    Drink lots of fresh water - not tap water.</p><p>    Light activity to start (walking 20 minutes daily and stretching, for instance); increase your activity with time. Activity is your friend.</p><p> </p><p><strong>For those who are burdened with lots of extra weight,</strong> I’d ask you to remember these 4 points:</p><p>1. Stop Over Eating.  And make better food choices. Using whole foods only. You are currently taking in too many calories each and every day to maintain your weight; to lose weight you must reduce your caloric intake.  BUT if you eat the wrong foods it does not matter how little you are eating.  This is key to understand.</p><p>2. It will take time to lose the weight; you need to be persistent and patient.</p><p>3. The OCC Diet Success Plan can help you succeed while being ACTIVE.</p><p>4. JUST START!</p><p> </p><p><strong>ONE THEORY:</strong></p><p>One theory is that obesity is, at least in part, a result of a slow, under-performing thyroid gland according to some obesity associations or support groups.  We can inform you how to improve your Thyroid Health.  You see there is something called the Endocrine System - the glands in our body that supply hormones (thyroid gland and pancreas for example are key).</p><p>Poor Gut Health including Leaky Gut Syndrome can lead to Endocrine Disorder which can lead to disease and being over-weight (amongst others).  BUT this is crucial to understand.</p><p><strong>That is why The Silver Bullet Approach is so important -</strong> because it takes gut health and the endocrine system into great consideration.  BUT WE KEEP IT SIMPLE - do you need to understand all this or just get on an approach that works ?  That is really up to you - we can explain this all to you in coaching sessions or simply give you the STEPS to succeed at weight loss and overcoming obesity.</p><p>Google “obesity” and start reading.  You will find other potential items that can lead to obesity. Getting out of any mental rut you may understandably be in is often a key part towards overcoming obesity.  </p><p>By setting goals and having a plan to achieve them daily will certainly help your mental attitude. And treat yourself nicely – walks in the sunshine or by the water or in the woods are all helpful to our mental health. Stay busy and get your mind off your problems.</p><p><strong>VITAMIN D</strong> received naturally from sunshine is now considered to be crucial to our health by many health care professionals.  30 minutes daily of sunshine without sunscreen is important to good health on so many levels.  It will help with your Gut Health and your metabolism in most instances.</p><p>We are of course focused primarily on diet and encourage you to get active. But be aware of these other issues related to obesity and try your best.</p><p> </p><p><strong>A Personal Note From Our Founder:</strong></p><p><i>I am sure you have faced some very difficult times in the past. Maybe it was bullying in the schoolyard, embarrassment or the suffering associated from certain health conditions.

And, I want to “feel” for you.  </i></p><p><i>However, my job is to help you.  So I must remind you that everything that may have happened to you previously – is now in the past.  You can’t change it. So let it go.  </i></p><p><i>What you can do is live in the present moment and be determined to change your life from this very point on.  Right now. This period of time you can definitely control. So, please do anything to set your weight goals and JUST START.</i></p><p><i>One “first step” should be this: Go to your fridge and kitchen cupboards right now and remove all the bad foods.

There are probably 3,000 calories+ alone in the foods listed above, and these food choices are full of all the foods we want you to AVOID; they are fried and processed foods. Please, stop doing that!</p><p> </p><p>Stop going to fast food restaurants and start cooking whole foods at home.  </p><p>Start today by preparing this dinner for your child (and don’t use your microwave ever again):  </p><p>A baked chicken breast, spiced with herbs (not sauces)</p><p>Salad</p><p>Fresh vegetables</p><p>Fruit for dessert</p><p>Fresh Water (not tap water), before and after dinner</p><p> </p><p>After dinner, go for a walk with your child or get them active anyway you can.</p><p>Limit their “screen time” to 3 or 4 hours per day and get them outside being active with the “extra time” created by limiting their use of smartphones, tablets and TVs.</p><p> </p><p>All the strategies and principles to help your overweight child (or children) are contained in our information that is available.  Please use them for yourself and your family.

Chances are you need regular help. A Recipe For Disaster:If we were having a conversation about this, we would advise you (with your doctor’s permission and endorsement) to start by simply counting your calories and being aware of the normal adult levels to give you a sense of making better food choices. Then, “step down” your daily caloric goal, week by week.We can tell you about a free App for your Smartphone or computer to Count Calories easily to stay on-track.Once your daily calories are at normal adult levels for a few weeks, begin restricting them further and start to follow the OOC Diet Success Plan(TM).  We can provide that to you - discuss please.The normal calories consumed daily are as follows:  For women at 1,600 calories and for men at 2,200 calories daily.  Try and get there over time - then go lower.BUT if you are eating the wrong foods and have leaky gut syndrome you will not optimize your weight loss results.  Get the right food choices and use our Approach to win.  Most folks who are obese are consuming in excess of 4,000 to 6,000 daily calories.Combined with terrible food choices, no activity, poor gut health and it is a Recipe For Disaster.Severely overweight or obese people should lose weight during our suggested “step down” period and the rate of weight loss should increase once they begin the OCC Diet Success Plan because it is based on sound principles. When incorporated for overcoming obesity also adopt these good habits:     We will inform you of the key foods to eat to stay full and healthy    Eat whole foods only; avoid processed foods and junk foods   AVOID: Soda drinks (diet and regular) and sugary drinks - they are your enemy    Understand that FOUR Key Foods are Your ENEMY!  They are literally killing you and keeping the weight on.  Eliminate them and the weight starts to fly-off you.    Generally eat all the fruits and veggies you like.  Unless you are diabetic then special foods need consideration.    Drink lots of fresh water - not tap water.    Light activity to start (walking 20 minutes daily and stretching, for instance); increase your activity with time. Activity is your friend. For those who are burdened with lots of extra weight, I’d ask you to remember these 4 points:1. Stop Over Eating.  And make better food choices. Using whole foods only. You are currently taking in too many calories each and every day to maintain your weight; to lose weight you must reduce your caloric intake.  BUT if you eat the wrong foods it does not matter how little you are eating.  This is key to understand.2. It will take time to lose the weight; you need to be persistent and patient.3. The OCC Diet Success Plan can help you succeed while being ACTIVE.4. JUST START! ONE THEORY:One theory is that obesity is, at least in part, a result of a slow, under-performing thyroid gland according to some obesity associations or support groups.  We can inform you how to improve your Thyroid Health.  You see there is something called the Endocrine System - the glands in our body that supply hormones (thyroid gland and pancreas for example are key).Poor Gut Health including Leaky Gut Syndrome can lead to Endocrine Disorder which can lead to disease and being over-weight (amongst others).  BUT this is crucial to understand.That is why The Silver Bullet Approach is so important - because it takes gut health and the endocrine system into great consideration.  BUT WE KEEP IT SIMPLE - do you need to understand all this or just get on an approach that works ?  That is really up to you - we can explain this all to you in coaching sessions or simply give you the STEPS to succeed at weight loss and overcoming obesity.Google “obesity” and start reading.  You will find other potential items that can lead to obesity. Getting out of any mental rut you may understandably be in is often a key part towards overcoming obesity.  By setting goals and having a plan to achieve them daily will certainly help your mental attitude. And treat yourself nicely – walks in the sunshine or by the water or in the woods are all helpful to our mental health. Stay busy and get your mind off your problems.VITAMIN D received naturally from sunshine is now considered to be crucial to our health by many health care professionals.  30 minutes daily of sunshine without sunscreen is important to good health on so many levels.  It will help with your Gut Health and your metabolism in most instances.We are of course focused primarily on diet and encourage you to get active. But be aware of these other issues related to obesity and try your best. A Personal Note From Our Founder:I am sure you have faced some very difficult times in the past. Maybe it was bullying in the schoolyard, embarrassment or the suffering associated from certain health conditions. If this is happening to your child – there aren’t many other things that can affect us so negatively. I wish I could reach out, touch you, and say, “you will be OK.”  To a great extent we have written our information and approach with you in mind. And, I want to “feel” for you.  However, my job is to help you.  So I must remind you that everything that may have happened to you previously – is now in the past.  You can’t change it. So let it go.  What you can do is live in the present moment and be determined to change your life from this very point on.  Right now. This period of time you can definitely control. So, please do anything to set your weight goals and JUST START.One “first step” should be this: Go to your fridge and kitchen cupboards right now and remove all the bad foods. What You Eat Matters, we can include a list of foods to avoid for you. Get rid of these foods from your home immediately and you will be forced to start making better food choices.I wish you well on your health journey and truly hope that we can help you succeed and become THE NEW YOU."" Parents or Guardians of Obese ChildrenSorry, but this is tough love for you.  YOU need to change your lifestyle and understand how to eat better using whole foods, not to over-eat, and to get active. And, support your child to overcome obesity.  You need to become the teacher.In most cases, you are enabling your children.   This may be because you don’t know better – and that’s OK, you are reading this information for insights to help you.  Also, you are not alone, as many Americans are in the same boat.If you watch the television shows about the lives of obese people, look at the food that parents bring home for their children:  A big bucket of fried chickenFrench friesA big bottle of soda popMaybe, a pizza for laterLeftovers are microwaved later that night as a snack These parents may have the best of intentions (to feed their children), but they are choosing the wrong foods. There are probably 3,000 calories+ alone in the foods listed above, and these food choices are full of all the foods we want you to AVOID; they are fried and processed foods. Please, stop doing that! Stop going to fast food restaurants and start cooking whole foods at home.  Start today by preparing this dinner for your child (and don’t use your microwave ever again):  A baked chicken breast, spiced with herbs (not sauces)SaladFresh vegetablesFruit for dessertFresh Water (not tap water), before and after dinner After dinner, go for a walk with your child or get them active anyway you can.Limit their “screen time” to 3 or 4 hours per day and get them outside being active with the “extra time” created by limiting their use of smartphones, tablets and TVs. All the strategies and principles to help your overweight child (or children) are contained in our information that is available.  Please use them for yourself and your family. Consult our Cookbook for how to prepare your foods and for what foods to buy – The Shopping List is there.This is your chance at a new start. We know you love your child and that’s why you are reading this information – to help him/her change.  So, please, take responsibility and learn how to make good food choices for your child.  Consider The Silver Bullet Approach(TM) for both you and your child.""Remember: You Are Not Alone"" If you are very obese you will need help.Reach out and seek it. But please start somewhere. CONTACT US: TheClinicsOnline@gmail.com ABOUT USOur Founder & Managing DirectorMr. Mason has previously controlled and operated 25 Medical Clinics with a small team that had over 70 M.D.'s plus over 75 support staff on payroll. Certain clinics also offered pharmacy, laboratory, imagining, dental, physio, psychiatry, and other services in addition to family medicine and walk-in care.  He has been involved with projects including cardiovascular monitoring over the internet, PRP / Stem Cells, and Electronic Medical Records.  Also controlled previously with a small team 100 optical stores with optical lab.  He has previously been an author, broadcaster and public speaker.He understands the medical business, how it functions and how the new delivery model to help others truly needs to be online - to save the health care system extensive costs and to be practical in today's evolving world. Plus after working with doctors for over the past 30 years knows the importance of only using medical professionals to provide and prove any strategies before providing the same for information purposes.He is approaching the age of 60 and has the experience, drive and ability to lead the Online Obesity Clinics onto greatness.  He is not a doctor rather an experienced businessman. He has great vision and compassion for others and knows how to treat all team members with respect and to give them the confidence so they can personally excel.  And truly wants to help others.  Previously he has been involved with extensive real estate development projects - if you can build buildings you can get thru many business issues at all levels.A Personal Note from Our Founder:""My personal weight loss journey started over 8 years ago - initially I lost about 35 pounds over a few months.  But more importantly I discovered how to keep the weight off for life.Today I am about 40 pounds below where I started and doing a good job of maintaining my weight.  More importantly I have discovered that disease is directly related to our nutrition.  We will share many of these insights with you.  However no one needs to be perfect.  I certainly am not!  I have ups and downs like so many of us.  Life just is not perfect.Initially we started out to create an online medical clinic to help others - only to realize that doctors can not generally provide their services outside of their jurisdiction of governance or not even online in most jurisdictions.  However, we know that the future of health care must be delivered online.Accordingly, we have developed our delivery model, systems and processes - they really are unique and will help change the world. So when challenged with not being able to have doctors directly on staff - we turned to perhaps something better.  We decided to draw upon world leading medical professionals and authorities to help others - and not to be restricted to just any one physician. We have spent the majority of our time not on marketing; rather on development and research (as one can only imagine how consuming that must be).  So when we say we can potentially save you years of research to understand how to deal with obesity or weight loss - we mean it.I was perhaps one of the several pioneers in developing walk-in medical clinics many years ago.  Today walk-in medical clinics are very common.  We anticipate that our style of online clinics will also become common within 15 years.  For now we are unique - but our strategies are based upon the years of experience and studies of certain medical professionals.We truly are here to help and will do our best by you.  I wish you well on your health journey and really hope that we can assist you or your loved ones. Our Vision is to revolutionize how we ALL manage or prevent disease and to enhance LONGEVITY.""    In our case, it will be, ""One Client at a Time."" TEAM and TEAM MEMBERS TO DEVELOPManaging Director                      Senior CoachesAssociate Coaches                      Medical AdvisersNatural Health Advisers             Research AssociatesCommunications Director         Operations DirectorOperations Staff                            Marketing & Client Support  CONTACT US:   TheClinicsOnline@gmail.com  IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERWE ARE NOT DOCTORS.  OUR SERVICES CAN NOT BE CONSTRUED AS MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS, MEDICAL TREATMENT, OR CURE OF ANY DISEASE, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THOSE SERVICES, WHICH CAN ONLY BE PERFORMED BY A LICENSED PHYSICIAN OR DOCTOR. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES OFFERED RESPECTING OUTCOMES OR RESULTS OF OUR SERVICES AND PLANS.

<p>MECHANISM OF ACTION<br/>Our brain is a real command center. Different areas of the cerebral cortex are responsible for thinking, learning, attention, movement, hearing, vision, and more. By changing the activity of these zones, one can improve many parameters of the brain. This is how tDCS works - transcranial stimulation with direct current.<br/>Through two electrodes, a specially modulated current (direct current of 1-2 milliamperes) is applied, which changes the excitability of nerve cells, in other words, their ability to transmit a nerve signal. A positively charged electrode (anode) increases the excitability of neurons, while a negatively charged electrode (cathode) reduces it.<br/>By suppressing the work of some areas of the brain, and by increasing the activity of others, many mental abilities and emotional state can be improved.</p>
<p>SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH<br/>The tDCS method has been studied for over 30 years by leading neuroscientists around the world. Initially, it was considered as exclusively medical technology and was successfully used to treat depression, chronic pain, and recovery from a stroke. Gradually, scientists have discovered that tDCS can also be used to improve the cognitive abilities of perfectly healthy people. In 2008, the US military - DARPA conducted a study in which tDCS accelerated the training of volunteers 2.1 times. Subsequently, the benefits of tDCS were manifested in the areas of improving memory, a concentration of attention and mathematical and linguistic abilities, and learning sports.</p>
<p>To eliminate the placebo effect, there is a control group in tDCS studies. People in this group imitate tDCS so that they are sure that they are also being stimulated. All the positive effects of tDCS are shown only in comparison with the control group!<br/>The impact parameters of the Brainstorm Neurostimulator fully coincide with those used in the scientific and medical literature ""</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My husband plays Rugby for the Brunei Darussalam National Team and the UBD Sharks Rugby Club; and has been actively involved in the Brunei rugby community for almost 10 years. Although the sport has huge potential in Brunei, it has unfortunately grown slowly as it faces many challenges, mainly funding, in order to push it one step further. </p>
<p>Every year, athletes have had to raise their own funds in order to compete in tournaments, buy their rugby kits and pay for boarding and accommodation. After many brainstorming sessions with his mates on how to sustainably support these young athletes, Headhunter Sport was born. Headhunter Sport manufactures high-quality bespoke rugby kits and $2 from every purchase of a rugby kit will be set aside to fund the Headhunter Sport Rugby Academy.</p>

Many yogi and yogini like to practice outdoor in a natural setting. Have you ever realized that Yoga equipment is actually not genuinely friend of nature?Natmat26 is the Italian start-up of specialized products for yoga, dedicated to you, practicing in a conscious and sustainable way. We select only environmentally sustainable raw materials, taking into account the entire life cycle of the article.We have launched #freeyogafromplastic and created our brand to give our contribute to our environment. We have detailed our idea of sustainability to clear the meaning we give to this abused word. ONꓱ!Block is our first product and this campaign will give us the opportunity to develop more and more creative solutions to let you enjoy your yoga practice and meditation in full respect of nature. There is no such thing as ONꓱ!Block ONꓱ!BlockWorld's first sensory yoga block. The most beautiful and the most sustainable one. ABOUT THE NAMEꓱ! Is a symbol used in maths to identify something that ""exists and is unique"".ONꓱ! Is our first collection named after three reasons: One, unique pieces handmade in Italy.One, life long lasting.One, limited edition.FEATURESA single glance to be seduced by its elegance. A caress is enough to feel the rippled texture that guarantees a stable grip during practice.The grooves are designed for aromatherapy, we deliver it scented with wood and honey, feel free to pour your favorite essential oil, a few drops on the surface to release an amplified relaxation effect. ONꓱ!Block is also available in the package with our organic lavender ØNꓱ!Essential Oil, produced in Italy by organic agricolture.ONꓱ!Block is a valuable piece of Italian craftsmanship, you can also use as a piece of home decor. A traveling companion that will evolve with you. WOODWood is the living and evolutionary material, it allows to get in touch with nature. It conveys positive vibes, warmth and well-being. Our senses draw strength from its scent, from touch, from observing its rings that are its history, from its shimmering color over time, from its vibrations.ONꓱ!Block is made from solid Princess Tree wood from sustainable Italian arboriculture. This is a fast growing tree from controlled tree cultivation, hence is does not impact deforestation.Our Princess Tree grows in crops where biodiversity is the watchword, because they consist of many varieties of medicinal plants and flowers.It is also called ""The anti-smog plant"", as matter of fact each Princess Tree absorbs from 28 to 32 tons of CO2 per year.It has a very light wood, ONꓱ!Block is available in two sizes regular and compact. Its weight is only 450g  (0,99 pounds)  for a size of 22.5x10x7.5CM (8,85 x 3,93 x 2,75 inch) in the compact version and 22.5x12x7.5CM (8,85 x 5,93 x 2,75 inch) in the regular one.PROCESSINGIt has only two ingredients: solid wood and beeswax.No glue. These are not glued pieces of wood, but ONꓱ!, a single piece of solid wood. Handmade in Italy. It is sanded, brushed and polished with beeswax. Each brick is therefore unique in its appearance and craftsmanship. WHAT’S BEEN ELEVATEDYoga blocks came in foam, cork or wood.We should stop buying plastic items as much as we can. Foam blocks production should be stopped NOW. There are sustainable alternatives, we do not need foam blocks at all. Please spread this statement among your yoga community.Having said that wooden blocks are usually heavy and slippery, we resolved this issue using this amazing light wood and designing a rippled texture. We tested this block with several yoga teachers and we’ve got super positive feedback about the functionality of ONꓱ!Block. Also they have been surprised about the touching experience.Cork is very commonly used and is a very noble material. Nevertheless  we want to give an alternative as cork can not be the only and unique solution, sustainability needs balance, variety. Also cork soaks up sweat, this is not too hygienic, leading to bad smell issue that might be a problem using cork yoga blocks. FUNDSAccording to our idea of sustainability we are not aiming to big numbers,We set a goal of 5000€ in order to cover initial expenses we have faced related to planning, production, advertising and online associated incidentals.Whether we will reach the goal or not we will invest raised amount to develop further sustainable solutions, for advertising to spread the word and addressing  part of it to social or environmental causes. RISKS & CHALLENGESONꓱ!Block is already at the production stage, therefore there is a very short lead time from fund to delivery. Once the campaign is ended we will be able to sort out the delivery in a short time.Main challenge is that we are not able to provide you with unlimited production in respect of sustainability and resources. We will monitor and evaluate it in due course. That said, rest assured that every eligible offer will be rewarded. OTHER WAYS YOU CAN SUPPORTWe understand that not everybody are able to make an offer, no worries.

<h3>What are negative ions?</h3>
<p>An ion is a atom or molecule with an electric charge. They are naturally occurring and have either a positive charge (through the loss of an electron) or a negative charge (through the gain of an extra electron).</p>
<p>While they're found almost everywhere, negative ions, also known as anions, are particularly common in areas with waterfalls, forests, and beaches. It's no surprise that the air in these places feels ""fresher"", since it's full of anions. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586885390/vmfud6stijxyqqkajoc9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>But what's so special about these negatively-charged anions?  </strong></p>
<p>Alongside a host of reported health benefits including stress relief, improved moods, and stronger immune response, negative ions have a well-documented effect on airborne particles. They attract these small particles, be it dust, chemicals, or pollen, into larger clumps,  which then sink to ground level or are trapped by conventional filters. </p>

<p>Even your back seat passengers (kids and pets) will benefit from healthy negative ions!  </p>
<ul>
<li>From the front seat, we generated anion measurements of 800k to 1.2M anions/cm<sup>3</sup>. </li>
<li>From the middle seat, we generated anion measurements of 30k to 60k anions/cm<sup>3</sup>. </li>
<li>From the back seat, we generated anion measurements of 20k to 60k anions/cm<sup>3</sup>.</li>

<p>Our team tested a leading ionizer available in the market. Watch the video below to see how negative ions are poorly generated and distributed throughout the car interior. Other ionizers are bulky and require external power and long cords to operate. They are inconvenient to use as they occupy space for other important items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Regular ionizer has a high density of anions when close up. (Over 1M within 5cm)</li>
<li>Yet, its anion counts drop to ZERO when 12-13cm away.</li>

<p>We will work hard to execute our production plans and will quickly send out the first batch of Fanionizers to all our backers. We may see a few challenges with shipping to countries with strict custom guidelines for our shipment. Nonetheless, we will communicate these matters to all who will be affected.</p>
<h3>Want to help Fanionizer?</h3>
<p>If you're excited about the health benefits Fanionizer can realise but aren't in a position to back us at present, that's OK! We'd love for you to spread the word, share this campaign, and pass it on to anyone who might be interested. Thank you for your support! </p>
<h3>Who we are &amp; why we're dedicated to Fanionizer</h3>
<p>Our team members are all fascinated with the benefits of anions. Anions not only neutralize foul odors and fine particles, but they also let human beings (and pets, based on our observations) feel refreshed all the time. Our office was already packed with all kinds of ionizers before we decided to develop Fanionizer. But one day, a friend brought us an anion detector and we found out that 90% of the ionizers we had were basically useless! We decided then to make a effective and convenient ionizer on our own. </p>
<p>After 2 years of development, the prototypes have been so successful that we are eager to introduce it to lovers of ionizers worldwide. </p>
<p>That's why we have this page.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>More support means lower costs</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have achieved pilot manufacturing so far, so we are really confident that we will achieve mass-production once the campaign finishes.</li>
<li>All we need is to have enough orders so we can reduce the unit cost to a reasonable price. </li>
<li>Unlike many cheap ionizers that you can buy on Amazon, Fanionizer use high-quality materials and components. This makes it really effective but at a higher cost of manufacturing.  But don't worry, the SuperEarlyBird pack provides state-of-art Fanionizers at a discount even below our estimated cost. Grab one while you can!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact</h3>
<p>Save the earth while enjoying the benefits.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are NO other wind-driven ionizers in the world. Fanionizer saves energy by turning the output from regular fans into a beneficial anion-filled breeze.</li>
<li>Fanionizer will (as far as we know) be the lightest ionizer in the world. And your contribution makes it real. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have made enough prototypes to be confident we can make Fanionizers at scale.</li>
<li>However, due to the current coronavirus pandemic, logistics services (including regular post office services) may be impacted. It may take a little longer for us to ship the products to you after the campaign ends. </li>

From the back seat, we generated anion measurements of 20k to 60k anions/cm3.

 
Our team tested a leading ionizer available in the market. Watch the video below to see how negative ions are poorly generated and distributed throughout the car interior. Other ionizers are bulky and require external power and long cords to operate. They are inconvenient to use as they occupy space for other important items.

Regular ionizer has a high density of anions when close up. (Over 1M within 5cm)
Yet, its anion counts drop to ZERO when 12-13cm away.

 
We will work hard to execute our production plans and will quickly send out the first batch of Fanionizers to all our backers. We may see a few challenges with shipping to countries with strict custom guidelines for our shipment. Nonetheless, we will communicate these matters to all who will be affected.
Want to help Fanionizer?
If you're excited about the health benefits Fanionizer can realise but aren't in a position to back us at present, that's OK! We'd love for you to spread the word, share this campaign, and pass it on to anyone who might be interested. Thank you for your support! 
Who we are & why we're dedicated to Fanionizer
Our team members are all fascinated with the benefits of anions. Anions not only neutralize foul odors and fine particles, but they also let human beings (and pets, based on our observations) feel refreshed all the time. Our office was already packed with all kinds of ionizers before we decided to develop Fanionizer. But one day, a friend brought us an anion detector and we found out that 90% of the ionizers we had were basically useless! We decided then to make a effective and convenient ionizer on our own. 
After 2 years of development, the prototypes have been so successful that we are eager to introduce it to lovers of ionizers worldwide. 
That's why we have this page.

More support means lower costs

We have achieved pilot manufacturing so far, so we are really confident that we will achieve mass-production once the campaign finishes.
All we need is to have enough orders so we can reduce the unit cost to a reasonable price. 
Unlike many cheap ionizers that you can buy on Amazon, Fanionizer use high-quality materials and components. This makes it really effective but at a higher cost of manufacturing.  But don't worry, the SuperEarlyBird pack provides state-of-art Fanionizers at a discount even below our estimated cost. Grab one while you can!


The impact
Save the earth while enjoying the benefits.

There are NO other wind-driven ionizers in the world. Fanionizer saves energy by turning the output from regular fans into a beneficial anion-filled breeze.
Fanionizer will (as far as we know) be the lightest ionizer in the world. And your contribution makes it real. 


Risks & Challenges

We have made enough prototypes to be confident we can make Fanionizers at scale.
However, due to the current coronavirus pandemic, logistics services (including regular post office services) may be impacted. It may take a little longer for us to ship the products to you after the campaign ends.",21.0,2,"1 Campaign

As a Hi-Tech company with developers around the world it seemed reasonable to assume that there was something we could do.</p><h3><strong>*****   BREAKING NEWS   ******</strong></h3><p>Major issues have surfaced as Vaccination sites have become more prevalent: what Waiting List should I be on for this location, how can I navigate the sign up process to actually get a Vaccination, How can I possibly understand the process? </p><p>This has become a virtual nightmare for a significant portion of our community. Oft times the explanations provided that are intended to help an individual register for a vaccination are so obtuse or are mired in so much techno babble that many of us get lost in the process - <strong>WE NEED HELP NOW!</strong> </p><p>Couple the massive requirement that virtually everyone should be vaccinated with the fact that a vast number of locations are gearing up to offer vaccinations and they do not have any common standards or processes - a situation has arose where just getting signed up to get a vaccine has become a major source of frustration for many of us.</p><p>The solution involves identifying someone that can help navigate this quagmire. </p><p>We have addressed this problem by implementing the only National Waitlist Volunteer/Participant Matching Program in the country. Our national reach has enabled us to tackle this problem head on and we are aggressively building out our framework of Volunteers to provide assistance to those individuals having problems navigating the bureaucratic  hodgepodge that now defines the registration process.</p><p>This is a massive undertaking and one that we are well equipped to address, but we do need your assistance in getting this program fully operational. We are in Beta in North Texas, with a plan to roll this out throughout Texas within 7-10 days and then in 20 of the most populous states by the end of the month.</p><p>Please help us make this a reality. We are incurring additional costs everyday as we ramp up this program. Any amount helps ....</p><h3><strong>***********************************</strong></h3><h3>
<strong>***********************************</strong><br/><br/><strong>Our initial effort concentrated on 2 problems that could be addressed with Software solutions</strong><br/><br/><strong>1. Where are Covid-19 Vaccination Sites - How can I sign up for a Vaccination</strong><br/><br/>We decided early on that distribution  was going to be a key component of any solution once the manufacturers made vaccines available. Not to much of a stretch to assume that getting vaccinations in the arms of almost 300M people was going to get messy. As expected this has become somewhat of a nightmare.</h3><p>We continued to work on a solution as it became apparent that one was needed. This solution had to be easy to use, have a very simple interface, and needed to provide the information that everyone is seeking. Furthermore it had to be <strong>FREE</strong>. If <u>everyone</u> is going to have the same chance to get their vaccine shot when it becomes available, telling that person where to go cannot be beyond their means.</p><p>While there are sites coming on line identifying vaccination locations most of them are associated with one provider (Walmart, CVS, etc) - where is the site that provides location information for all vaccination sites in each given location and even more than that tells you where they stand with new deliveries.</p><p>We homed in on identifying the specific locations where vaccines would be found but we also added the date that each location last received vaccines. Our 3-Step App provides this information.</p><p>Our National Waitlist Matching program will bring a significant number of folks to our sites and we expect rapid acceptance of our offerings.</p><p>Our <strong>COVID3Step</strong> app provides the software related solutions discussed above.</p><p>This app is now available in selected locations and is Free to the general public.

And how can we individually track our Covid Journey for ourselves and our family</strong><br/><br/>We need to have an Ultra Secure repository where we can save our Individual and Family Test Results, Vaccination Logs and Exposure History. Ideally this information should be saved using a Smart Phone App in an Ultra Secure Digital Vault. It should be accessible using a simple, easy to use  interface that can be easily understood by everyone. <br/><br/>We have developed a solution that ensures that personal information is only accessible by the individual user – that individual should have complete access and control of their own information.</p><p><i><strong>INTRODUCING COVID1Stop – An App where you can save your Covid Information</strong></i><br/><br/>How do we know that folks that we are going to meet are following evidence-based, public health guidelines regarding COVID-19, and that they are safe to be around?  We have the solution!

Our solutions are so easy to use and are so needed.</p><h3>
<br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong>
</h3><p><strong>OUR SOLUTIONS ARE BEING PROVIDED AT MINIMAL COST</strong><br/><br/>These tools are needed by everyone, and they are needed now. The best way to get these out to the community at large is to make them available at little or no cost. These solutions can be a fantastic help in these trying times, if virtually anyone can have access to it.<br/> </p><p><strong>COVID3Step </strong>is being offered at <strong>NO COST</strong> - we can't make it any more reasonable. Now we need to let folks know that it is available</p><p>In order to meet our goal of making <strong>COVID1Stop</strong> available to everyone, we have defined a very minimal pricing approach.  The app can be downloaded from the App stores for free. When a person registers and sets up his digital vault there is a $10 charge and when a Test or Vaccination is added a one time $5 charge is incurred. We also offer additional discounts for Annual and Lifetime subscriptions and for Family subscriptions.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611788322/rmljjvhjrhnigumkub8f.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>It is in our community's best interest to bring solutions like this one to the general public, as soon as possible. We have designed  our solution to address the many concerns associated with making personal information available via a digital app. If we are to achieve the herd immunity needed to eradicate this disease, we need as many people as possible practicing  Covid Awareness solutions and our app will provide a certain degree of confidence to assist in meeting this goal.</p><h2><strong>Fund Raising Targets</strong></h2><p>We will execute this project in 3 phases – Phase I (Introduce our solutions to those in need), Phase II (Reach sufficient number of folks so that reaching the additional effort required to reach folks becomes self-sustaining), Phase 3 (Sustaining phase funded by incoming revenue).</p><p>Our ultimate goal is to make our Solutions and our Apps available to anyone that wants one and at a price that they can afford. <strong>Your help will go a long way towards making this a reality.</strong></p><p>We will measure project success based on customer reach and functionality provided.</p><p>We have budgeted the following for this effort:</p><p><strong>                                                                        Phase I                             Phase II</strong></p><p>                                                                                   8 Weeks                                3 Months            </p><p>                                                                                 <strong>$125,000                         $175,000</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Marketing                                                    $100,000                         $125,000</strong></p><p>Waitlist Support Team</p><p><i>SEO Enhancements</i></p><p><i>Name Recognition</i></p><p><i>Customer Growth</i></p><p><i>Celebrity Spokesperson</i></p><p><strong>Complete Phase I App Functionality        $25,000</strong></p><p><strong>Add Additional App Functionality                                                    $50,000</strong></p><p><strong>PHASE I – 8 weeks</strong></p><p>We are using a framework similar to that used over the last 18 years to rollout our national County Research program. Today we have operations in all 50 states and have reached almost 2,000 courts since we opened our doors.  We operate in every major metropolitan area and have excellent suburban and rural area reach.</p><p>We are ramping up Our Matching solution by building a network of Volunteers to assist us in providing needed Waitlist related help. Processes have been defined, the organizational structure to be implemented has been put in place and we are ready to begin the match process.</p><p>Our Smartphone Apps are in Beta and will be production ready by the end of Feb 2021. We expect to have them in the App stores in march and until that time will make them available on our Web Sites.</p><p>Remaining development work includes a thorough QA review including final security updates as well as extensive scaling-related testing to ensure that the app scales properly as additional  users subscribe to our service. Our Apps have been thoroughly vetted throughout the development process and the remaining efforts are typical last minute development-related tasks that will ensure that they function exactly as envisioned.</p><p><strong>Marketing</strong></p><p>The success of our apps will depend heavily on  their acceptance with the community as a whole. Based on our experience with establishing a National presence for our parent companies we will target the 40+ MSAs with the largest metro populations knowing that this approach will put us in front of a sizable percentage of the US population.</p><p>We have defined a comprehensive marketing campaign based on an extensive Social Media Marketing effort coupled with an aggressive advertising outreach program. We will expand our marketing reach by implementing additional Facebook and Google efforts complimented by a robust set of supplemental marketing approaches including print media campaigns and influencer marketing efforts.</p><p><strong>PHASE II – 3 Months</strong></p><p>We will add enhancements to our Phase I solution as they are identified.  Our solution is very robust as currently developed, but as with any software solution presented to a very large number of individuals we are aware that we will need to add additional enhancements over time.</p><p>Regarding our Marketing efforts, we will continue marketing to the top 40 large MSAs since they represent ~50% of the population in the US, but we will also expand and continue to add enhancements to our Advertising and Marketing efforts and will present our solution to even more folks in a concerted effort to become self sufficient.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>How you can Help</strong></h2><p>As you can imagine – developing solutions like these is not an inexpensive effort. To date we have borne this cost – now we need your help to push this across the finish line.<br/><br/>We have worked diligently to develop the processes and infrastructure to make this concept a reality. Ours is the first solution in the Covid Record Keeping Category, and we need your help in finalizing this solution.<br/><br/>Additionally, as of this time, there is no one solutions provider currently identifying the many Vaccination Centers that are available at a national level.<br/><br/>The information we are providing changes each day, but it is available through public forums. We have defined the teams needed, the steps required, and the resources necessary to gather this information. Through relationships with many of the providers of these solutions and a nationally focused research team that has assumed the role of collecting the information necessary, we can make this concept a reality.<br/><br/>In order to take this concept to the next level, assemble the resources needed, and implement the solutions we have envisioned, we need your help in raising additional funding.<br/><br/>Think of this as “priming the pump.” For those of you not aware of this concept – your grandparents &amp; great-grandparents used to have to take a leap of faith when getting water from their well. This involved taking a certain amount of water and using it to get the well to begin pumping. Think about that – what if the last drop of water they had available had to be used to get more? This is what we are asking of you help us initiate our grand journey – Help us make our solution available to the masses.<br/><br/>Once we reach critical mass, revenue will be sufficient to continue to expand – our mission at this point in time is to “prime the pump”.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What if we do not reach our Funding Goals</strong></p><p>We do believe that our solution will benefit so many folks and that once recognized for the help that it will bring  - funding will be forthcoming. However, if in the unlikely event we do not reach our goals we will bootstrap successive efforts and will continue to fund the rollout with revenue generated - the rollout will just be slower.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Our Perks – making this opportunity even more appealing</strong></h2><p><strong>AllLT Covid Founders Community</strong></p><p>We have created this community to provide those of you that wish to participate as a Founding Member an opportunity to be recognized for your contribution.

We are ready for Prime Time.</p><p>We will be providing Vaccination location information for virtually every major population center in the country. Yes – this information is available and is being presented via the web in each of these locations. Yes – it changes every day, so we have assembled a team of researchers that are reviewing and updating information as it is posted. Also we are in the process of establishing ongoing relationships with the organizations and municipalities tasked will providing these solutions so that our information is always timely. We have coupled that with online tools that allow these groups to update their information as desired.  We do know how to make this effort successful and are building the infrastructure to make it a reality.<br/><br/>It’s as if we have been readying for this moment for a really long time. Our company has long been one of the premier data collection and processing companies in the US. For almost 20 years we have been working with county clerks across the country and have built a national network of researchers tasked with retrieving monthly county court related data. To date, we have completed research projects in the vast majority of counties in virtually every major population center in the country. We really do understand how to manage a national effort.</p><p>For the last several years we have been refining an offering, providing services and solutions for anyone facing a major life transition.

As a Hi-Tech company with developers around the world it seemed reasonable to assume that there was something we could do.*****   BREAKING NEWS   ******Major issues have surfaced as Vaccination sites have become more prevalent: what Waiting List should I be on for this location, how can I navigate the sign up process to actually get a Vaccination, How can I possibly understand the process? This has become a virtual nightmare for a significant portion of our community. Oft times the explanations provided that are intended to help an individual register for a vaccination are so obtuse or are mired in so much techno babble that many of us get lost in the process - WE NEED HELP NOW! Couple the massive requirement that virtually everyone should be vaccinated with the fact that a vast number of locations are gearing up to offer vaccinations and they do not have any common standards or processes - a situation has arose where just getting signed up to get a vaccine has become a major source of frustration for many of us.The solution involves identifying someone that can help navigate this quagmire. We have addressed this problem by implementing the only National Waitlist Volunteer/Participant Matching Program in the country. Our national reach has enabled us to tackle this problem head on and we are aggressively building out our framework of Volunteers to provide assistance to those individuals having problems navigating the bureaucratic  hodgepodge that now defines the registration process.This is a massive undertaking and one that we are well equipped to address, but we do need your assistance in getting this program fully operational. We are in Beta in North Texas, with a plan to roll this out throughout Texas within 7-10 days and then in 20 of the most populous states by the end of the month.Please help us make this a reality. We are incurring additional costs everyday as we ramp up this program. Any amount helps ....***********************************
***********************************Our initial effort concentrated on 2 problems that could be addressed with Software solutions1. Where are Covid-19 Vaccination Sites - How can I sign up for a VaccinationWe decided early on that distribution  was going to be a key component of any solution once the manufacturers made vaccines available. Not to much of a stretch to assume that getting vaccinations in the arms of almost 300M people was going to get messy. As expected this has become somewhat of a nightmare.We continued to work on a solution as it became apparent that one was needed. This solution had to be easy to use, have a very simple interface, and needed to provide the information that everyone is seeking. Furthermore it had to be FREE. If everyone is going to have the same chance to get their vaccine shot when it becomes available, telling that person where to go cannot be beyond their means.While there are sites coming on line identifying vaccination locations most of them are associated with one provider (Walmart, CVS, etc) - where is the site that provides location information for all vaccination sites in each given location and even more than that tells you where they stand with new deliveries.We homed in on identifying the specific locations where vaccines would be found but we also added the date that each location last received vaccines. Our 3-Step App provides this information.Our National Waitlist Matching program will bring a significant number of folks to our sites and we expect rapid acceptance of our offerings.Our COVID3Step app provides the software related solutions discussed above.This app is now available in selected locations and is Free to the general public. Visit www.COVID3Step.com for more information.2. And how can we individually track our Covid Journey for ourselves and our familyWe need to have an Ultra Secure repository where we can save our Individual and Family Test Results, Vaccination Logs and Exposure History. Ideally this information should be saved using a Smart Phone App in an Ultra Secure Digital Vault. It should be accessible using a simple, easy to use  interface that can be easily understood by everyone. We have developed a solution that ensures that personal information is only accessible by the individual user – that individual should have complete access and control of their own information.INTRODUCING COVID1Stop – An App where you can save your Covid InformationHow do we know that folks that we are going to meet are following evidence-based, public health guidelines regarding COVID-19, and that they are safe to be around?  We have the solution! Save the appropriate documentation and have it available for presentation when requested.Our COVID1Stop App provides the answer:Maintain your Family's Covid status on our AppWith a single touch, you can display your Covid Immunization card, or you can drill down and retrieve any family member’s card. Also you can retrieve a complete log of all Covid testing that you have completed, and you can recall your entire exposure history.This is so easy - results from any lab may be displayed on any Smart Phone and results are maintained in one of the most secure Digital Vaults in the entire country. You can now retrieve your Covid information and share any information that you choose with whomever you desire. NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP TO GET OUR COVID APPS TO MAINSTREAM AMERICAWe are close to releasing our Covid-19 Apps, just a little bit of work remains to finalize them, and then we need to let folks know that our 2 apps are available. Our solutions are so easy to use and are so needed.
What We Need & What You Get
OUR SOLUTIONS ARE BEING PROVIDED AT MINIMAL COSTThese tools are needed by everyone, and they are needed now. The best way to get these out to the community at large is to make them available at little or no cost. These solutions can be a fantastic help in these trying times, if virtually anyone can have access to it. COVID3Step is being offered at NO COST - we can't make it any more reasonable. Now we need to let folks know that it is availableIn order to meet our goal of making COVID1Stop available to everyone, we have defined a very minimal pricing approach.  The app can be downloaded from the App stores for free. When a person registers and sets up his digital vault there is a $10 charge and when a Test or Vaccination is added a one time $5 charge is incurred. We also offer additional discounts for Annual and Lifetime subscriptions and for Family subscriptions.It is in our community's best interest to bring solutions like this one to the general public, as soon as possible. We have designed  our solution to address the many concerns associated with making personal information available via a digital app. If we are to achieve the herd immunity needed to eradicate this disease, we need as many people as possible practicing  Covid Awareness solutions and our app will provide a certain degree of confidence to assist in meeting this goal.Fund Raising TargetsWe will execute this project in 3 phases – Phase I (Introduce our solutions to those in need), Phase II (Reach sufficient number of folks so that reaching the additional effort required to reach folks becomes self-sustaining), Phase 3 (Sustaining phase funded by incoming revenue).Our ultimate goal is to make our Solutions and our Apps available to anyone that wants one and at a price that they can afford. Your help will go a long way towards making this a reality.We will measure project success based on customer reach and functionality provided.We have budgeted the following for this effort:                                                                        Phase I                             Phase II                                                                                   8 Weeks                                3 Months                                                                                             $125,000                         $175,000 Marketing                                                    $100,000                         $125,000Waitlist Support TeamSEO EnhancementsName RecognitionCustomer GrowthCelebrity SpokespersonComplete Phase I App Functionality        $25,000Add Additional App Functionality                                                    $50,000PHASE I – 8 weeksWe are using a framework similar to that used over the last 18 years to rollout our national County Research program. Today we have operations in all 50 states and have reached almost 2,000 courts since we opened our doors.  We operate in every major metropolitan area and have excellent suburban and rural area reach.We are ramping up Our Matching solution by building a network of Volunteers to assist us in providing needed Waitlist related help. Processes have been defined, the organizational structure to be implemented has been put in place and we are ready to begin the match process.Our Smartphone Apps are in Beta and will be production ready by the end of Feb 2021. We expect to have them in the App stores in march and until that time will make them available on our Web Sites.Remaining development work includes a thorough QA review including final security updates as well as extensive scaling-related testing to ensure that the app scales properly as additional  users subscribe to our service. Our Apps have been thoroughly vetted throughout the development process and the remaining efforts are typical last minute development-related tasks that will ensure that they function exactly as envisioned.MarketingThe success of our apps will depend heavily on  their acceptance with the community as a whole. Based on our experience with establishing a National presence for our parent companies we will target the 40+ MSAs with the largest metro populations knowing that this approach will put us in front of a sizable percentage of the US population.We have defined a comprehensive marketing campaign based on an extensive Social Media Marketing effort coupled with an aggressive advertising outreach program. We will expand our marketing reach by implementing additional Facebook and Google efforts complimented by a robust set of supplemental marketing approaches including print media campaigns and influencer marketing efforts.PHASE II – 3 MonthsWe will add enhancements to our Phase I solution as they are identified.  Our solution is very robust as currently developed, but as with any software solution presented to a very large number of individuals we are aware that we will need to add additional enhancements over time.Regarding our Marketing efforts, we will continue marketing to the top 40 large MSAs since they represent ~50% of the population in the US, but we will also expand and continue to add enhancements to our Advertising and Marketing efforts and will present our solution to even more folks in a concerted effort to become self sufficient. How you can HelpAs you can imagine – developing solutions like these is not an inexpensive effort. To date we have borne this cost – now we need your help to push this across the finish line.We have worked diligently to develop the processes and infrastructure to make this concept a reality. Ours is the first solution in the Covid Record Keeping Category, and we need your help in finalizing this solution.Additionally, as of this time, there is no one solutions provider currently identifying the many Vaccination Centers that are available at a national level.The information we are providing changes each day, but it is available through public forums. We have defined the teams needed, the steps required, and the resources necessary to gather this information. Through relationships with many of the providers of these solutions and a nationally focused research team that has assumed the role of collecting the information necessary, we can make this concept a reality.In order to take this concept to the next level, assemble the resources needed, and implement the solutions we have envisioned, we need your help in raising additional funding.Think of this as “priming the pump.” For those of you not aware of this concept – your grandparents & great-grandparents used to have to take a leap of faith when getting water from their well. This involved taking a certain amount of water and using it to get the well to begin pumping. Think about that – what if the last drop of water they had available had to be used to get more? This is what we are asking of you help us initiate our grand journey – Help us make our solution available to the masses.Once we reach critical mass, revenue will be sufficient to continue to expand – our mission at this point in time is to “prime the pump”. What if we do not reach our Funding GoalsWe do believe that our solution will benefit so many folks and that once recognized for the help that it will bring  - funding will be forthcoming. However, if in the unlikely event we do not reach our goals we will bootstrap successive efforts and will continue to fund the rollout with revenue generated - the rollout will just be slower. Our Perks – making this opportunity even more appealingAllLT Covid Founders CommunityWe have created this community to provide those of you that wish to participate as a Founding Member an opportunity to be recognized for your contribution.

There are solutions on the horizon, but as we are being told by the scientific community these will only work if a sufficient percentage of our populace choose to participate.The operational phrase is “herd Immunity” and is dependent on the vast majority of us choosing to participate by washing our hands, wearing masks, practicing social distancing and being tested and vaccinated.Our Covid App solutions are a wonderful step to help us move in the right direction. By participating in our program, you not only help yourself, but you can help all of those folks that will benefit from our solutions.Any solution is only as good as those folks actually using it. We need your help to reach the largest number of folks possible and make our solutions available to them as soon as possible.We know what we are doing and we are ready Our Apps are being developed by a global team of IT professionals. Our IT solutions are housed in some of the most up to date production facilities in the world, our developers use state of art tools and databases, and our Highly Secure Data Vault is managed by one of the premier solution providers in the world. Our staff has a great deal of experience in the development of very large enterprise solutions and in the production management of very large scalable solutions. We are ready for Prime Time.We will be providing Vaccination location information for virtually every major population center in the country. Yes – this information is available and is being presented via the web in each of these locations. Yes – it changes every day, so we have assembled a team of researchers that are reviewing and updating information as it is posted. Also we are in the process of establishing ongoing relationships with the organizations and municipalities tasked will providing these solutions so that our information is always timely. We have coupled that with online tools that allow these groups to update their information as desired.  We do know how to make this effort successful and are building the infrastructure to make it a reality.It’s as if we have been readying for this moment for a really long time. Our company has long been one of the premier data collection and processing companies in the US. For almost 20 years we have been working with county clerks across the country and have built a national network of researchers tasked with retrieving monthly county court related data. To date, we have completed research projects in the vast majority of counties in virtually every major population center in the country. We really do understand how to manage a national effort.For the last several years we have been refining an offering, providing services and solutions for anyone facing a major life transition. This is a massive effort and one that we are making a reality. Our parent company, All Life Transitions (www.AllLT.com), has partnered with service and solution providers at both the national and neighborhood level to provide transitional support where needed.  This is a comprehensive program involving 1,000’s of providers and has provided us the organizational expertise to bring our Covid solutions to market.These efforts have prepared us to lead this challenging effort and now we are in the final stages of bringing our Covid-19 Apps to the general public. Risks & ChallengesWe have invested a great deal of time and effort in ensuring that the solutions we are providing will work as advertised. We have applied state of art QA testing methods to ensure that we have addressed every issue.One major concern that we had to overcome was – what if we are deluged with requests for our solutions. Operating any solution at scale can be a challenge.We mitigated those risks by bringing on a staff that is well versed in managing large scale operations ranging from major credit card solutions to massive banking and financial operations. Additionally, we have built our solutions on massively scalable platforms that routinely manage tens of millions of transactions daily.WHAT ABOUT PRIVACY CONCERNS?Our COVID1Stop solution has been designed to be a Personal Record Keeping solution, not a government mandated solution where your information is used to control access to various venues. Our App is a brand new category of Covid Apps – Personal Record Keeping, and it allows you to maintain complete control over your information.Note that Passport-like tools are currently in development, and they are being called Covid Digital Passports. As such, they raise many concerns regarding individual privacy. We have chosen a radically different approach – one where you control your personal information and are the only one that can choose to make this information available -  providing it only to those you wish.By virtue of your maintaining complete control, our approach makes our solution HIPPA compliant. For us, Personal Data security is paramount and your personal control of your data is your first amendment right. Anyone using our solution will find that their data is protected in as secure a manner as possible. Other Ways You Can HelpIn addition to providing funding support there are many ways that you can help.STEP 1 – SHARE OUR MESSAGEOf course the most expedient way to help is to Tell Your Friends – Word of mouth is the best way to introduce people to our program.

Be sure to Like our pages and to forward our links to your friends and family.We need your help.

<p><strong>REPAIR </strong>Dermal Restructuring Therapy (Peptides)</p>
<p><strong>REPAIR Peptide Dermal Therapy</strong> is an effective prescription strength therapeutic formulation designed to correct damage and create a more youthful complexion. Peptides act as tiny messengers that stimulate different responses in your skin, helping it to function, look and feel better. Because peptides are small, they can penetrate the skin’s protective barriers to get to the deeper layers. <strong>REPAIR </strong>stimulates collagen and elastin rebuilding from within while moisturizing and nourishing. <strong>Fine lines and wrinkles are reduced, the skin is plumped and smoothed with hydration, and the skin's barrier function is improved</strong>. It also protects and heals with naturally derived antioxidants.</p>

You may even have it without realising it. There is much written about Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) and the importance of good quality sleep, some of which you can read about on our website (the link is at the very end of this piece). <br/></p><p>In the meantime though, there are some simple things that you may already know about or which may be new to you and make you go ""Oh Yes!"". </p><p>For example, people tend to stop snoring or snore less when their airway is open and this more likely if someone is lying on their side as opposed to their back. As an aside, this is why our oral appliances work - they open up the airway so you can breathe better while you sleep. Very simple, but very effective.</p><p>It is also known that people who have sleep apnoea are quite likely to snore, but if you snore it doesn't mean you have OSA; although there is a relationship between these two things in many people. </p><p>You may have seen your partner stopping breathing while asleep and then gasping for air, possibly with a snorting sound; this is almost certainly an apnoea (a cessation of breathing) and it may mean they are not getting enough oxygen into their blood. This can be very bad news indeed as it can have the same effect on your major organs as being a heavy smoker. If it happens repeatedly, or for a long period of time, then it can make you feel lousy in the morning and cause some serious health issues. </p><p>It seems to be made worse if you have put on weight as the extra body mass around the windpipe can make it smaller and cause an obstruction to the flow of air. You're basically strangling yourself while you sleep and you don't even know it. So of course the thing to do in this situation is to examine your diet and lifestyle, cut out sugar and all the other things you've heard about, but of course all this takes time. On the other hand, if you want an immediate improvement in your breathing while you sleep then one of our appliances is what you need. </p><p>There is a good chance if your airway stays open while you sleep you will feel so much better in the morning, you won't snore and your health will be much better for it.  Oh and of course having better quality sleep will probably help reduce daytime tiredness and fatigue. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b><br/></p><p>We believe the risks in this project are low because we have many years experience in this field and our team knows their stuff very well. We are confident that when we raise the money, we will deliver a product to you that does what we say it does and in the time-frame we promise. In fact I'm very happy to personally make that promise.</p><p>In terms of challenges, as we have done this before we know what to expect and we can anticipate where there will be problems and plan accordingly. We know this because we have encountered most problems on our previous projects and we know how to deal with them. We also work with a very fine manufacturing company with whom we have a track record and a great deal of respect. </p><p><br/></p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help<br/></b></p><p><b>SPREAD THE WORD</b></p><p>If you feel, for whatever reason, you can't pledge to our campaign, we would be very grateful if you could please help by spreading the word.

We know this from being a world leader in this field for over 15 years.All our products work by keeping the upper airway open giving you an uninterrupted flow of air while you sleep. This provides you with a better quality of sleep and is a tried-and-tested way to stop snoring. We continually strive to improve our designs in order to give you the best possible products. And we believe when you pledge for our new SleepPro Ultra, you are going to receive the best off-the-shelf product of its type in the world. We invite you to be among the first to experience its comfort and effectiveness.We would greatly appreciate your support as it means we can keep the SleepPro Ultra at home in Britain. Most of our competitors make their products in China and it reflects in the quality of what they sell. Of course it is cheaper to make things on the other side of the world, but our goal has always been to offer our customers the best quality we can and that's why we are proud to have the Made in Britain stamp on our products. Hi, My Name is Paul Swann and I've spent the last 15 years designing and making both affordable and custom-made oral appliances for snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea. I'm very pleased to tell you my team and I have helped a huge number of people all over the world in the process. Not just stopping their snoring, but improving their health in a very meaningful way. And if you have a problem with snoring or other sleep related issues, it is very likely we can help you get a good nights sleep.Right now I'm looking to make a new mould in England, making sure we use the strictest quality control we can and make our new product available in about four months. It is by far my best design yet at this price level and I think people will find it more comfortable to wear and better in other important ways.  It would be fantastic if you could be part of making this happen and helping to keep it great by keeping it in Great Britain - making it possible for us to observe very high standards of quality one expects from a country that is rightly famous for quality with names like Rolls Royce and the BBC. And of course the benefit to you is you will get to see for yourself what a difference a  SleepPro Ultra can make to your sleep, your health and your life.What We Need We need to engineer a new injection mould which we'll use to make our fantastic new mouthpiece.  We have plenty of experience in doing this and so we know what we need to do to ""get it right"". The cost of the mould will be £40,000 which is just under $60,000  or €50,000 and this is what the funds we raise will be used for.What You GetPledgers will receive a life changing new product. We can say from experience you will quite probably stop snoring and sleep better. And if not, we'll give you your money back.Use Your Pledge as a Credit ...In return for supporting our campaign you are invited to pledge for any of the things we make, including our new appliance, or one of our existing appliances and a choice of other things listed on our perks page.  And if you change your mind between now and later you can use your pledge as a credit for something else offered by us - we will be happy to swap it over for you.  The ImpactSnoring and sleep apnoea have a profound effect on people's quality of sleep as well as their happiness, well-being and general health. We believe that by providing affordable high quality oral-appliances we can make a huge impact on these problems. And if these things affect you, then we may be able to change your life. I know this is a big ""call"", but over the years we have heard it again and again from many satisfied customers.Sleep apnoea is a hugely under-diagnosed condition that affects a surprising number of people. You may even have it without realising it. There is much written about Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) and the importance of good quality sleep, some of which you can read about on our website (the link is at the very end of this piece). In the meantime though, there are some simple things that you may already know about or which may be new to you and make you go ""Oh Yes!"". For example, people tend to stop snoring or snore less when their airway is open and this more likely if someone is lying on their side as opposed to their back. As an aside, this is why our oral appliances work - they open up the airway so you can breathe better while you sleep. Very simple, but very effective.It is also known that people who have sleep apnoea are quite likely to snore, but if you snore it doesn't mean you have OSA; although there is a relationship between these two things in many people. You may have seen your partner stopping breathing while asleep and then gasping for air, possibly with a snorting sound; this is almost certainly an apnoea (a cessation of breathing) and it may mean they are not getting enough oxygen into their blood. This can be very bad news indeed as it can have the same effect on your major organs as being a heavy smoker. If it happens repeatedly, or for a long period of time, then it can make you feel lousy in the morning and cause some serious health issues. It seems to be made worse if you have put on weight as the extra body mass around the windpipe can make it smaller and cause an obstruction to the flow of air. You're basically strangling yourself while you sleep and you don't even know it. So of course the thing to do in this situation is to examine your diet and lifestyle, cut out sugar and all the other things you've heard about, but of course all this takes time. On the other hand, if you want an immediate improvement in your breathing while you sleep then one of our appliances is what you need. There is a good chance if your airway stays open while you sleep you will feel so much better in the morning, you won't snore and your health will be much better for it.  Oh and of course having better quality sleep will probably help reduce daytime tiredness and fatigue. Risks & ChallengesWe believe the risks in this project are low because we have many years experience in this field and our team knows their stuff very well. We are confident that when we raise the money, we will deliver a product to you that does what we say it does and in the time-frame we promise. In fact I'm very happy to personally make that promise.In terms of challenges, as we have done this before we know what to expect and we can anticipate where there will be problems and plan accordingly. We know this because we have encountered most problems on our previous projects and we know how to deal with them. We also work with a very fine manufacturing company with whom we have a track record and a great deal of respect. Other Ways You Can HelpSPREAD THE WORDIf you feel, for whatever reason, you can't pledge to our campaign, we would be very grateful if you could please help by spreading the word. I am certain you know someone who snores heavily and I would love them to know about our campaign. They will quite probably thank you later.Without doubt, the most powerful thing you can do is to talk about us both face-to-face with friends and family and through social media. The most effective of these for us is Facebook. Please Like and Share Our FaceBook Page​ENGAGE PEOPLE IN CONVERSATION - it could save their life.Please visit our website www.SleepPro.com  and join our mailing list especially if you would like more information about our products or would like to learn more about obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and the health implications for poor quality sleep.TESTIMONIALSWe have many many glowing testimonials from people who have seen a big change in their life because of SleepPro. Please visit our website www.SleepPro.com/testimonials  to see some of our testimonials or read those below to get a feel for what people think us.

We love subscription services due to the convenience, time and cost savings because we are busy parents with full-time jobs ourselves!Tina Saw, D.D.S. (Co-Founder)Practicing private practice dentist in Carlsbad, California and a dental graduate of Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. Busy mom of a baby.Thanh Luu, D.D.S. (Co-Founder)Practicing general dentist of both a non-profit community clinic and private practice in San Diego, California and a dental graduate of Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. Our MissionDrs. Tina Saw and Thanh Luu believe that dental care should be both affordable and convenient, challenging the status quo. We built a beautiful private dental practice, but then broke out of our comfort zone and devoted another part of our time to a non-profit dental clinic. As dentists, we both provide our services to as many people as possible, but also believe we can do much more for our community and beyond.Our personal goal is to positively influence and help improve oral health in as many people as possible. Our project is to design a system that will be able to match specific oral health products to the individuals that needs them. We use the knowledge and expertise of our training from dental school, dental practice and the most updated and current research literature to understand the oral cavity, a.k.a. your mouth. Compiling all of that information, we at Dental Care Box are able to match a dental product that best help you! Why Dental Care Box? More Than Just ToothbrushesWe select and deliver the perfect oral hygiene products to your doorstep every 3 months, the recommended frequency by dentists of when you should change your toothbrush.

We deliver handpicked products to your doorstep at less than what you would get at the store. We Simplify ThingsThe store can be overwhelming when it comes to selecting the correct dental products for your needs.

<p><strong>Running Magazine – Why It Makes Sense To Donate For It</strong></p>
<p>Though the internet and other electronics and digital means of communication are growing at a rapid pace, the print media continues to be important and it attracts millions of readers. Though the age profile of this group of readers might be different, it has its own group of committed and loyal followers. It is especially strong in areas where the reach of the digital and electronic means of communication is limited and there are millions who belong to this category. While there are many magazines who start publishing with the concept of profit being only the strong point in the mind, there are a few who do it with the purpose of service to mankind in mind. One such publishing is called Running Magazine and it certainly has an interesting and touching objective to it. It would not be a bad idea to know more about this magazine.</p> <p><strong>It Has Service To Mankind As Its Core Value</strong></p> <p>As mentioned above it would be pertinent to mention that this particular magazine is being published keeping in mind the broader interests of mankind. While the subject matter of the magazine will be on jogging and the advantages it offers, it will also have quite a few interesting tips to offer. It will certainly be of use to all those who wish to keep their body and mind in good shape through jogging. It will also share some useful and meaningful information to share to those who want to excel in the field of jogging. The tips, suggestions and anecdotes are quite interesting and relevant and quite a few of them we hope will be from experts on the subject matter. </p> <p><strong>It Will Be Free Of Cost</strong></p> <p>The best thing about Running Magazine is that it will be complete free of cost and will be available to all those who are keen on getting some useful tips on the subject matter of running and jogging. It will offer insights into the various reasons why many fail in making jogging a long term exercise to keep their body fit as a fiddle. It will also offer expert advices regarding the medical conditions for which jogging could be useful and the do’s and don’ts as far as jogging is concerned. Hence at the end of the day there is no doubt that in spite of being a free magazine it will have some of the most interesting and attractive information with regard to jogging and light running. </p> <p><strong>Why We Are Making It Free</strong></p> <p>We are keen on making this whole project a non-profit venture and have a larger objective in mind. We have found out that there are thousands of women and children who are keen on finding out ways and means to keep their body in good shape. However they lack the right kind of information on the subject matter and do not know how to get started and how to keep the momentum going. We are trying to reach out to these sections of people and that is perhaps the biggest endeavor as far as our magazine is concerned. We are hopeful that it will help scores of women and children in particular to become active participants in jogging as far as the neighborhood and society is concerned. Beyond this objective, we do not have any commercial interests as far as the publication and running of this magazine is concerned.</p> <p><strong>We Seek Donations</strong></p> <p>There is no denying the fact that it does cost money to print the magazine and there are quite a few fixed and variable expenses that we need to be prepared to spend. Since it is a magazine being planned by not-so-wealthy individuals, we are certainly short of funds. While we have arranged to put in our own funds as a right-thinking group, we do believe that our objective will be better served if we can get donations and help from right thinking individuals. We especially look for help from those who are keen on seeing their wards and women lead a better quality of life with better health and fitness levels. We are more than confident that the information that we plan to provide in this magazine will be immense help and assistance to those who are keen on staring their day on the right note with some well thought out and planned jogging exercises. We are sure that running magazine will have a number of pictorial representations of the various aspects pertaining to jogging making it quite unique and different. It certainly will add value to all those who wish to become expert joggers over a period of time. </p> <p><strong>How Will The Donations Be Used</strong></p> <p>We wish to point out that the donations which we are seeking for well wishers will be used for running our office. We are operating out of a rented property and therefore we will have to arrange funds for paying rent on a regular basis. Further there are other recurring expenses which have to be met on a regular basis. We are looking for donations for likeminded people only for the purpose of paying rent and other recurring expenses. </p> <p><strong>The Magazine Will Be Published Weekly</strong></p> <p>It would be pertinent to mention here that we will be publishing the magazine on a weekly basis and it will be circulated amongst the local community with the help of volunteers and other members of the group.</p> <p><strong>Your Support Is Required</strong></p> <p>At the end of the day there is hardly any doubt that running a magazine on such a reasonably big scale with limited resources at our disposal is not an easy task. It certainly calls for support from as many quarters as possible. Hence we are reaching out to as many people as possible. We strongly believe that it will receive the required support and the response will be encouraging and perhaps even overwhelming. The donors can be rest assured that each dollar donated will be accounted for and there will be utmost transparency in our receipts and expenditure. The books of accounts will be subject to independent third party auditing and therefore donors can be sure that it will be used for the purpose for which the donation is being sought. </p>

However, 8 Seconds Glasses implement well-known, proven eye relaxing exercises. These glasses have been tested on many subjects and the relieving effect of their design is very noticeable.

The high-quality plastic body is pearly-white in color with a golden hue, looks very elegant and smooth, and is enjoyable to touch. The flexible cushion, made from very soft hypoallergenic, transparent blue silicone, is illuminated by a gentle light during the training program. The cushion wraps around the face, leaving you with a pleasant feeling of softness. The tinted glass provides relaxing twilight for the eyes.</p>

The lenses light up in sparkling shades of red, blue and green. The reds, which are for morning programs, help to wake you up. Green colors, specifically for office programs, are to relax the eyes. The blue-colored evening programs are to calm you down. For maximum comfort and convenience, the 8 Seconds system has a sensitive proximity sensor that starts the eye relaxation program automatically when you put on the glasses and stops when you take them off.</p>

In any situation, you can always choose the most suitable program for stress relief, sight preservation, and ultimate relaxation for your eyes. The morning programs are active and energetic. The office programs are for short relaxing breaks in between your work. The evening programs are slower to provide a calming effect. The colorful screen displays the duration, time remaining in the current program, program name, battery charge level, and time remaining before the next exercise. A smoothly running marquee displays a detailed description of the selected program.</p>

There are eight convenient reminder intervals, ranging from 15 minutes to two hours. The glasses remind you that it’s time to train by blinking a light and playing a musical sound. You can also set it to flash silently so that, if you are in a quiet office, the sound doesn’t distract your colleagues. If you are a left-handed person, you can easily rotate the image by pressing the two buttons at the same time. This will make it convenient for you to operate the device with your left hand, a bonus for left-handed people who rarely find user-friendly technology.</p>

The inscriptions ""left"" and ""right” are written on the handles, but this is for information rather than instruction, as they will not attach if you try to put them on the wrong side. 8 Seconds is fitted with a unique magnetic charging port which doesn’t break or wear out, giving you convenience, reliability, and long-term, trouble-free operation. Just like the handles, the charging port can only be connected in the correct way. It’s simply a pleasure to connect!</p>

It’s a practical way to show your friends and family how much you care about them and their health. Only Indiegogo backers will get exclusive models bearing the inscription ""8 Seconds Exclusive"", larger program memory and other advantages. Other buyers will have the inscription ""8 Seconds.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In crowdfunding, there's always potential for unexpected challenges to arise, although we hope none of these come up but sometimes things happen. The road from the very first idea to the final delivery of 8 Seconds Glasses is a long one.

We want to ensure that you get a product that matches your expectations in the time frame we’re aiming for.</p>

</div></div>","Share this project with your friends and relatives to help them save their eyes! We have 200 free gifts for the most active people who have shared our project! We are able to see all public references to this page with our marketing software. Spread the word as much as you can by clicking the buttons or pasting the link igg.me/at/8secondsThe 8 Seconds Glasses reestablish a natural working rhythm to your eyes. The specially-designed adjustable demagnification lenses make the eyes look into the distance therefore helping to relieve the tension caused by viewing a monitor at very close range. It’s like looking into binoculars in reverse. The specially-molded form of the glasses flawlessly matches with the eyes’ field of view. The lamps at the edges enable the eyes to quickly and actively move at the sides, allowing them to rest naturally after intense, slow reading of small font on a computer monitor.While other products provide only external eye massage, our 8 Seconds Glasses focus on internal eye muscles solving these issues at their source. 8 Seconds Glasses include a unique smartphone-based visual acuity test. Although this cannot replace medical testing, it is useful for estimating your visual well-being. 8 Seconds Glasses are not a medical device and cannot replace professional medical help in case of illness. However, 8 Seconds Glasses implement well-known, proven eye relaxing exercises. These glasses have been tested on many subjects and the relieving effect of their design is very noticeable. We are so confident in our product that each pair comes with a money back guarantee.

8 Seconds shape is compact, durable, lightweight, pleasant to wear, and convenient to use. The high-quality plastic body is pearly-white in color with a golden hue, looks very elegant and smooth, and is enjoyable to touch. The flexible cushion, made from very soft hypoallergenic, transparent blue silicone, is illuminated by a gentle light during the training program. The cushion wraps around the face, leaving you with a pleasant feeling of softness. The tinted glass provides relaxing twilight for the eyes.

 The light and lens compact system can be easily adjusted to fit the shape of your face and nose to ensure that your gadget is a perfect fit for you. The lenses light up in sparkling shades of red, blue and green. The reds, which are for morning programs, help to wake you up. Green colors, specifically for office programs, are to relax the eyes. The blue-colored evening programs are to calm you down. For maximum comfort and convenience, the 8 Seconds system has a sensitive proximity sensor that starts the eye relaxation program automatically when you put on the glasses and stops when you take them off.

 The user can operate the device from a bright, colorful screen where you can select one of the 16 programs. In any situation, you can always choose the most suitable program for stress relief, sight preservation, and ultimate relaxation for your eyes. The morning programs are active and energetic. The office programs are for short relaxing breaks in between your work. The evening programs are slower to provide a calming effect. The colorful screen displays the duration, time remaining in the current program, program name, battery charge level, and time remaining before the next exercise. A smoothly running marquee displays a detailed description of the selected program.

 The small button activates reminders and allows you to set the reminder interval or turn it off. There are eight convenient reminder intervals, ranging from 15 minutes to two hours. The glasses remind you that it’s time to train by blinking a light and playing a musical sound. You can also set it to flash silently so that, if you are in a quiet office, the sound doesn’t distract your colleagues. If you are a left-handed person, you can easily rotate the image by pressing the two buttons at the same time. This will make it convenient for you to operate the device with your left hand, a bonus for left-handed people who rarely find user-friendly technology.

 Magnets are a convenient way to secure the soft and flexible transparent handles, for storage and while wearing. The inscriptions ""left"" and ""right” are written on the handles, but this is for information rather than instruction, as they will not attach if you try to put them on the wrong side. 8 Seconds is fitted with a unique magnetic charging port which doesn’t break or wear out, giving you convenience, reliability, and long-term, trouble-free operation. Just like the handles, the charging port can only be connected in the correct way. It’s simply a pleasure to connect!

 The eyeglasses come with a sky blue cover of soft velvet fabric for protection. The beautiful box makes the glasses a very appealing and useful gift that won’t be easily forgotten. It’s a practical way to show your friends and family how much you care about them and their health. Only Indiegogo backers will get exclusive models bearing the inscription ""8 Seconds Exclusive"", larger program memory and other advantages. Other buyers will have the inscription ""8 Seconds. Eyestrain Relief."" Imagine how remarkable you will appear at the office among your colleagues, who will then also want the eyeglasses!

 The gadget has a user-friendly mobile app, where you can easily evaluate and track your visual acuity. Innovative website login allows you to start testing with your individual profile on any computer in the world - just open the 8seconds.us website and scan QR code with the mobile app. User-friendly program editor allows for creating custom exercise programs with author’s name on a screen. Then, in the form of a file, you can upload it to the eye gadget, share with other people, or upload it on the web.

The most expensive parts are the plastic and silicone mold forms because 8 Seconds Glasses have many mechanical and silicone parts. Our goal is to produce those parts with the quality of mobile phone cases.

Crowdfunding is not our only source of funds. If we don't achieve our funding goal here, but we receive investments, then we will proceed to mass production. If we don't achieve our funding goal and don't receive investment money, we will refund all money to the backers. Depending on the outcome, you will receive either a high quality product or your money back.

We have partners with years of experience in the fields of engineering, product design, and manufacturing. We have preliminary agreements with manufacturers, but conditions vary greatly depending on production quantities. Our time estimates also have some buffers to reduce schedule risks.

In crowdfunding, there's always potential for unexpected challenges to arise, although we hope none of these come up but sometimes things happen. The road from the very first idea to the final delivery of 8 Seconds Glasses is a long one. We’re doing everything possible on this side of our campaign to make sure that everything runs correctly once it’s been funded. We want to ensure that you get a product that matches your expectations in the time frame we’re aiming for.
We’re a team of perfectionists. Thanks to the range and depth of specialized knowledge within our team, we’ve put together prototypes that are very close to the industrial product design. Because we’re striving to create something that is not only functional but nice and durable, we’ve already faced and overcome many challenges during the development stage.
We understand the importance of communicating all decisions, setbacks, or changes. We will post weekly video reports about our progress on our Indiegogo and project pages. By becoming a backer, you are not simply buying a product - you are deciding to take part in an adventure and become part of the team.

<h3> Our Story:</h3>
<p>Hi!  My name is Cort and this lovely lady is my wife Karli.  Together we have five kids, are essential oil users, and Wellness Advocates.  We love all things natural and things that are good for you.  As essential oil users and educators, we know there can be some barriers associated with essential oil use, especially for children.  When you consider the need for water, heat, electricity, or mechanical devices to diffuse an essential oil, and possibly skin sensitivities; there had to be a better way.  Over the past couple of years we have been working on and developing a fun, safe way to enjoy the aroma and natural health benefits of essential oils (especially for kids-but not limited to) without the need for skin contact, water, heat, electricity, or any mechanical device. We want to introduce you to MEO Pals, the first aromatherapy friend.  MEO Pal’s patent pending design allows for an individual to enjoy the essential oil of their choice in one of the safest ways possible, without the use of any of the issues mentioned above.  Contributors to this campaign will be responsible for not only helping bring MEO Pals to market, but will also help make a difference to a lot of people through the associated charities.  Every MEO Pal is named for a real person and will be connected to a charity/cause. A portion of sales from each MEO Pal will go to that charity/cause.</p>
<p><strong>""Grif the Great""</strong> - Portions of the funds raised in this campaign will go Sickle Cell Anemia research and Grif’s medical expenses.  So... not only do you get an adorable aromatherapy friend, but you also can help make a difference for Grif and Sickle Cell Anemia research.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“Imagine trying to purchase a car without knowing<br/>... how good it is or what it will cost.<br/>That’s the situation consumers face when choosing a doctor.” </i><br/><strong>- </strong><strong><a href=""http://www.pbgh.org/chpi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pacific Business Group on Health</a></strong><strong> –</strong></p>
<div>When I moved from New York to the Boston area 2 years ago, I needed to find a new doctor, hospital and health plan.  I went to the internet and was initially <u>overwhelmed</u> by the number the available websites and <u>underwhelmed</u> by their content.</div>
<div>It took several months to decide on a doctor and a health plan.  Most people don't have that much time to spend on a search.  So they compromise and settle on a doctor that's just OK.  There are better ways.</div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">“<i>sites like Healthgrades, RateMDs, Vital, and Yelp ...<br/>[are] <u>riddled</u> <u>with</u> <u>limitations.</u></i>”<br/><strong>- <a href=""https://www.consumerreports.org/doctors/online-doctor-ratings-why-you-cant-always-rely/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Consumer Reports</a> -</strong>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<div>So I decided to write up what I learned as a guide to help consumers to quickly locate the few truly useful internet sites that will help them find the best doctors, hospitals and health plans based on objective measures of quality and cost (health plans). </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>What Every Healthcare Consumer Should Know</h3>
<div>After publishing the 2017 Massachusetts Edition of <strong>Finding the Best Healthcare You Can Afford, </strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I continued to do research and became more convinced than ever that there is a need and a method for finding better quality, safer healthcare at an affordable price.  Here are some highlights of what I found:</span>
</div>
<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;""><li>Going to the best hospital can reduce death and complications rates by 2/3 or more.</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530501302/hfanivbvieoh2rpuoamn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul style=""list-style-type:circle;"">
<li>Hospital safety ratings won’t help you find the hospitals with the lowest death rates.</li>
<li>Many consumers are unaware of their local hospital choices.</li>
<li>Few consumers consider hospital admitting privileges when choosing a physician.</li>
<li>Most doctor selection services don’t let you screen for the most important criteria.</li>
<li>Patient surveys don’t tell you which doctors provide the best quality of care.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2018 Edition</h3>
<div>The new, improved <strong>2018 Edition </strong>with <strong>Hospital Outcomes Scores </strong>(see below) will be national in scope, and we expect to publish in the third quarter of 2018.  This 2018 Edition will benefit from more than year of additional research, development of a better way to measure hospital safety (Hospital Outcomes Scores) and feedback from healthcare professionals, consumers, friends and family.</div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529410564/j5qmhogxb2b6fx5iluql.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<ul></ul>
<h3>Local Hospital Report</h3>
<p>Customized for each user, the Local Hospital Report will make it much easier to choose  a hospital, affiliated doctors and a health plan that includes your doctors and hospital.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529412824/fziahzebbiy65gtz34bo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Local Hospital Report combines Hospital Outcomes Scores (see below) for the top 10 hospitals (lowest death rates) in your specified area (city, county or state) together with other hospital ratings and a guide describing how to use the information. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Who They're For</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A US News survey found that over 60 percent of respondents are dissatisfied with one of  more of their doctors.  Even allowing for survey bias, there's a good chance that you or someone you know is looking for a new doctor, is facing surgery or has recently moved.</p>
</div>
<p>Anyone who hasn’t chosen a primary care physician a specialist, a health plan or a preferred hospital or is dissatisfied with their current choice can benefit from the <strong>2018 Edition </strong>and the <strong>Local Hospital Report</strong>.   That especially applies to people who have:</p>
<ul>
<li>changed jobs,</li>
<li>moved to a different part of the country,</li>
<li>are starting a family or</li>
<li>need a new health plan, which typically restricts the doctors and hospitals you can use.   </li>
</ul>
<h3>A Better, simpler way to choose a Doctor</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">“<i>Consumers simply don’t have the information they need to pick a doctor based on measurable quality or the expected cost of care.”</i><br/><strong>- </strong><strong><a href=""http://www.pbgh.org/chpi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pacific Business Group on Health</a></strong><strong> –</strong></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is a risk that we will be overwhelmed with requests for Local Hospital Safety reports, which could delay publication of the 2018 Edition.  But having written and published the 2017 Massachusetts Edition, we've got a pretty good prototype to work from and have been collecting information on other states for over a year.  In addition, we've pretty well documented Hospital Outcomes Scores, as demonstrated by the following article published on LinkedIn <strong><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hospital-outcomes-neglected-consumer-metric-peter-a-wadsworth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hospital Outcomes - A Neglected Metric</a></strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","“Imagine trying to purchase a car without knowing... how good it is or what it will cost.That’s the situation consumers face when choosing a doctor.” - Pacific Business Group on Health –
When I moved from New York to the Boston area 2 years ago, I needed to find a new doctor, hospital and health plan.  I went to the internet and was initially overwhelmed by the number the available websites and underwhelmed by their content.
It took several months to decide on a doctor and a health plan.  Most people don't have that much time to spend on a search.  So they compromise and settle on a doctor that's just OK.  There are better ways.
 
“sites like Healthgrades, RateMDs, Vital, and Yelp ...[are] riddled with limitations.”- Consumer Reports -

 
So I decided to write up what I learned as a guide to help consumers to quickly locate the few truly useful internet sites that will help them find the best doctors, hospitals and health plans based on objective measures of quality and cost (health plans). 
 
What Every Healthcare Consumer Should Know
After publishing the 2017 Massachusetts Edition of Finding the Best Healthcare You Can Afford, I continued to do research and became more convinced than ever that there is a need and a method for finding better quality, safer healthcare at an affordable price.  Here are some highlights of what I found:

Going to the best hospital can reduce death and complications rates by 2/3 or more.


Hospital safety ratings won’t help you find the hospitals with the lowest death rates.
Many consumers are unaware of their local hospital choices.
Few consumers consider hospital admitting privileges when choosing a physician.
Most doctor selection services don’t let you screen for the most important criteria.
Patient surveys don’t tell you which doctors provide the best quality of care.

2018 Edition
The new, improved 2018 Edition with Hospital Outcomes Scores (see below) will be national in scope, and we expect to publish in the third quarter of 2018.  This 2018 Edition will benefit from more than year of additional research, development of a better way to measure hospital safety (Hospital Outcomes Scores) and feedback from healthcare professionals, consumers, friends and family.

 
 

Local Hospital Report
Customized for each user, the Local Hospital Report will make it much easier to choose  a hospital, affiliated doctors and a health plan that includes your doctors and hospital.

The Local Hospital Report combines Hospital Outcomes Scores (see below) for the top 10 hospitals (lowest death rates) in your specified area (city, county or state) together with other hospital ratings and a guide describing how to use the information. 

Who They're For
A US News survey found that over 60 percent of respondents are dissatisfied with one of  more of their doctors.  Even allowing for survey bias, there's a good chance that you or someone you know is looking for a new doctor, is facing surgery or has recently moved.

Anyone who hasn’t chosen a primary care physician a specialist, a health plan or a preferred hospital or is dissatisfied with their current choice can benefit from the 2018 Edition and the Local Hospital Report.   That especially applies to people who have:

changed jobs,
moved to a different part of the country,
are starting a family or
need a new health plan, which typically restricts the doctors and hospitals you can use.   

A Better, simpler way to choose a Doctor
“Consumers simply don’t have the information they need to pick a doctor based on measurable quality or the expected cost of care.”- Pacific Business Group on Health –

A major focus of the 2017 Mass. Edition was how to choose a doctor based on the best available criteria for quality of care .  With so many primary care doctors over 3,000 within 10 miles of downtown Boston, and many more specialists, the choices are overwhelming.  Larger metropolitan areas, such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, are even more so. Choosing doctors based on patient surveys has been largely discredited:
""In ten years, none of them [sites like Healthgrades, RateMDs, Vital, and Yelp ]have amassed enough reviews to be useful.""- Consumer Reports -

“Hospital & medical group affiliation are the best available criteria to choose a doctor”- Finding the Best Healthcare You Can Afford –
We offer ways to narrow down the choices using the best websites and the best available criteria for quality of care, relying, in part, on proxy measures such as medical group and hospital affiliation.  Choosing a hospital before you choose a doctor has the two major advantages:

There are far fewer hospitals than doctors from which to choose.
There are much better measures of hospital (than doctor) quality and safety that can help consumers differentiate.

Yet a US News survey found that just 5% of those surveyed mentioned hospital affiliation (admitting privileges) as the most important factor when choosing a doctor.


Hospital Outcomes Scores
""Go to the Wrong Hospital and You’re 3 Times More Likely to Die""- New York Times 12/14/2016 -

Our “secret sauce” is the never-before-published Hospital Outcomes Scores (HOS), a new hospital safety rating system without which it is virtually impossible to find the hospital in your area with the lowest avoidable death rate (or complications rate). 
“negligible difference in mortality or complication rates​among hospitals receiving A, B, or C grades”- Hospital Safety Scores: Do Grades Really Matter?, Univ. of Michigan -
While other hospital safety and quality rating services include death and complications data provided by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (usually blended with other information), HOS offers the following advantages over other ratings systems:

Outcomes not diluted by combining them with non-outcome factors.
Median Scores of 50% make it easier to tell which hospitals are better.
Scores from 0% to 50% differentiate more effectively than 123 or ABC.

And HOS can compare many hospitals in your local area or across the United States to tell you which ones have the lowest death and complication rates.

<h1><b>Our Story</b></h1>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Hangover Killer was invented in 2003 by Ivan Ducko, a Slovakian inventor, who also launched a series of healthy beverages. His products, Alcohol Killer in particular, are wildly popular in Europe and are all made in Austria. Do you know that Ivan Ducko chose a manufacturing facility that sits directly above a water spring on the foot of the Austrian Alps, because of the unique ratio of minerals in the water? That's right. It's the same water they use to produce infant formula!</p>
<div>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004653/files/20141111062502-8f946184c5fa989911e63d0d0ab5a7d6_large.jpg?1415715902"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/></figure><p></p>
<p>In 2007, Ihor and Roman Koval, a father and son duo from Cleveland, OH bought the sole distribution right of Alcohol Killer in the U.S. They became partners with Ivan Ducko and worked with him to test the consumer market in the US by gathering feedback on taste, marketing and effectiveness. After taking the product to numerous trade shows around the US, the response was overwhelming. We first featured Alcohol Killer at the Chicago National Restaurant Association Show in both 2007 &amp; 2008. We also presented Alcohol Killer at the Atlanta National Convenient Store Show in 2007, the Cleveland Fabulous Food Show in 2008, and the Night Club &amp; Bar Show in Las Vegas in 2008. In the Las Vegas trade show alone, 6,000 cans of Alcohol Killer were snatched immediately.</p>

<br/></figure><p></p>
<p>After two years of intense market research, surveys and focus groups, the US consumers responded very well to the beverage itself but the name Alcohol Killer proved to be somewhat confusing. ""Why would I want to kill my buzz?"", people asked. Well, it doesn't kill your buzz. It's the terrible lingering effects of a hangover that it kills. Ihor and Roman realized the problem and spent the next few years rebranding the beverage as Hangover Killer. (US only)</p>

<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>For the curious minded, here is the explanation behind the effectiveness of Hangover Killer. When you consume alcohol, the majority of it is metabolized in the liver by specific enzymes. In this process, multiple harmful byproducts are created in your body, with acetate being one of the most harmful. Acetate is later converted by the body into H20 (water) and CO2 (carbon dioxide), but the short stay of this substance in your body during the process causes major harm to your liver and other organs.</p>
<p>If you don't remember what your high school biology teacher taught you, we’ll help refresh your memory about alcohol metabolism: After you shoot that shot of tequila, the alcohol goes into your stomach and eventually makes its way into your bloodstream, carrying alcohol to nearly every organ in your body. While it feels great to have that buzz, the buildup of alcohol can hurt your cells and organs. Being the impressive piece of machinery that our body is, it initiates several processes to reduce the harmful effects of the consumed alcohol. One of those processes is called oxidation. Simply put, oxidation detoxifies and removes alcohol from accumulating in your body, preventing further harm.</p>
<p>Before all the alcohol has been metabolized, it will affect the brain and other tissues of your body, and acetate is one of those bad byproducts of alcohol. Acetate increases adenosine in many tissues, including the brain. In simple English, acetate agitates your nerve cells that cause pain, resulting in those headaches. Alcohol also does a wonderful job at dehydrating your body and its organs. This too contributes to the nasty pains and nausea associated with hangovers</p>
<p>And that is where Hangover Killer comes in. This specially engineered beverage contains ingredients that shorten the existence of acetate, therefore speeding up the natural detoxification and recovery process. Hangover Killer also hydrates your body with the best water on earth, shortening that rehydrating process no pill or powder remedy can. Our independent studies indicate that Hangover Killer lowers your BAC on an average of 40% quicker!</p>

Hangover Killer is a lightly carbonated, refreshing beverage with a citrus taste specifically designed to lower your BAC an average of 40% quicker and prevent that nasty hangover from the get-go.

Hangover Killer uses spring water from the Alps, the same water used to make infant formula. Hangover Killer is 100% natural and only has herb based ingredients, made with the best water on earth. We refuse to use caffeine, taurine, chemical preservatives & stabilizers, artificial sweeteners & colors. We have many independent studies done by US and EU labs proving its effectiveness. Hangover Killer is entirely confirmed and compliant with FDA regulations and is completely ready for the US market.





What’s Inside?





Natural Spring Water -natural spring water from the Austrian Alps contains beneficial levels of calcium and magnesium, and very low levels of nitrates, nitrites, and sodium. Due to its high quality and purity, it is recommended by doctors for childhood nutrition programs, as well as for people with heart and kidney diseases.



Elderberry (Sambucus Nigra) - also known as European elder, a tall tree-like shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and naturalized in the United States. The plant has been called ""the medicine chest of country people"" since Elderberry is well-known in traditional medicine.



β-Glucan (extract of Oyster Mushrooms) - β-Glucan, also known as beta-glucan, are polysaccharides found in baker's yeast, certain types of fungi, and certain mushrooms. β-Glucan activates the body's natural defense mechanism and strengthens the body's natural immune response.





Lemon Grass (Cymbopogon Citratus) - Cymbopogon Citratus is also known as lemon grass, an aromatic perennial grass native to India. Lemon grass oil contains numerous therapeutic properties that benefit the nervous system.



L-Ascorbic Acid - L-Ascorbic Acid, an antioxidant, is required for the growth and repair of tissues and helps eliminate destructive free radicals. It is an essential component of healthy enzyme reactions, strengthens blood vessel walls, helps absorb iron, and strengthens the body's immune system.



Vitamin B1 - helps convert blood sugar into energy, helps keep mucus membranes healthy and is essential for the normal functioning of the nervous system, as well as cardiovascular and muscular systems.
Vitamin B6 - essential for the metabolism of amino acids and fatty acids, for normal nerve function, and helps maintain healthy skin. Both Vitamins B1 and B6 are important components of a co-enzyme used in energy metabolism.
Vitamin B3 - required for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Kevin McComb and Devansh Tandon, fitness enthusiasts and students at the Singapore American School, and we are Krónos Nutrition! Krónos Nutrition will be a business that aims at providing low cost yet good quality products (like our showcase pre-workout supplement, Zeus) to individuals that need that extra performance boost. Our biggest competitors are notorious for overpricing and under dosing when it comes to their workout supplements. Our goal is to appeal to mainly college age athletes looking to get the effects of pre-workout at a more affordable price and at a time in their life when their budget is slim. Our design is simple and sleek, focusing around a logo that resembles power and explosive energy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Kronos Nutrition is not another company with the same goal in the fitness industry. Kronos Nutrition is in the fitness industry to revolutionize the fitness industry and raise the overall standards of the consumer when it comes to price and quality. We are offering an opportunity for investors to place their faith in a product that has shown incredible potential with those who have come into contact with our products, and are asking for the capital required to expand our company to the point where our profit margins will allow us to exemplify the versatility available to companies in this industry. There are three reasons why our product is going to be a success, and these three reasons are more than enough to get the interest of the consumer - we are confident that it will be enough to draw them to switch from their current supplements to ours. Firstly, we offer our product at a significantly lower price point than the majority of the other brands in this market, allowing us to reach a demographic that may be struggling financially. Secondly, we are combining two highly sought after supplements (creatine and pre workout) into a single product, making it easy for the consumer to get their necessary supplementation at an extremely reasonable price point. Lastly, Zeus has eradicated the danger of a potential caffeine overdose by eliminating caffeine from the ingredient list and replacing it with Taurine - a much healthier alternative. Depending on the size of your contribution we will be able to send to you an item from our inventory of brand apparel as well as a container of our signature pre workout Zeus. Contributions of any size are a great help, and we are focusing on making the rewards just as great!</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is in Zeus? The ingredient list is shown below:</strong></p>
<p>Beta Alanine (2 grams per serving)= Beta-alanine is the building block of carnosine, a molecule that helps buffer acid in muscles, increasing physical performance in the 60–240-second range.</p>
<p>Citrulline Malate (6 grams per serving)= L-Citrulline supplementation results in reduced fatigue and improved endurance for both aerobic and anaerobic prolonged exercise.</p>
<p>Creatine Monohydrate (5 grams per serving)= Creatine is a molecule in an energy system (creatine phosphate) that can rapidly produce energy (ATP) to support cellular function. Thus its performance-enhancing and neuroprotective properties.</p>
<p>Taurine (1 gram per serving)= Taurine acts as both a cell protecting agent by modulating the cell membranes fluidity and health, as well as exerting anti-oxidant like effects. Taurine significantly reduces oxidative stress on cardiac muscle tissue in the presence of oxidative stress and can protect against damage from ischaemia-reperfusion injury in cardiac tissue.</p>
<p>L-Tyrosine (1 gram per serving)= L-Tyrosine is an amino acid that is used to produce noradrenaline and dopamine; supplemental appears to be anti-stress for acute stressors (which tend to deplete noradrenaline) and may preserve stress-induced memory deficits.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to the growth of Krónos Nutrition, you will be helping to prove to the fitness industry that there is no need for these big brands to be overpricing their products without having the quality to match. We have spent months developing our idea and planning out our production costs and marketing techniques, and even at the low price that we will be offering our product at we will still be making good profit margins. We are here because we believe in our product and because we hope that others believe in it too. In order to break out of the fitness trap that is overpriced and ineffective supplements, we want to show the consumer that there are other healthier, cheaper, and more effective alternatives. By contributing to this campaign, you are joining the movement towards a better fitness experience for all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If the customer chooses to substitute our product for a similar one, there is not a lot stopping them. The same goes the other way around. In a market like this one, what keeps the customers coming to you is the strength of your brand. From the feedback we have gotten on Kronos Nutrition we have found that we are very popular amongst our audience and the people who have interacted with our company. Our product also comes in at such a low price and with such a range of beneficial ingredients that the customer would be giving up a large amount of money to switch between products.</p>
<p>Our competitors have a large presence both in stores and online, making our strategy key. While our competitors run a very mechanical and impersonal business, we will be interacting with our audience. Big supplement companies  who already have their brands at a level of high customer recognition and are doing sales at an increasing rate on an international basis are what we need to look out for. Our strategy should be to keep our sales on a domestic basis until we have enough capital to take it outside of the country, because when these companies hear about Kronos Nutrition and what we offer to the consumer it would be difficult to stop them from replicating our service and product and crowding us out of the market. While we are growing and trying to increase our cash inflow, it is important that we remain humble and conservative with our marketing strategies and stay in our domestic market until we are confident we can grow at a rate that will be immune to these companies trying to replicate our product.</p>
</div><div>

Following our pages and spreading the word to anyone you think might be interested in our company will be a huge help on its own.</p>

Beta Alanine (2 grams per serving)= Beta-alanine is the building block of carnosine, a molecule that helps buffer acid in muscles, increasing physical performance in the 60–240-second range.
Citrulline Malate (6 grams per serving)= L-Citrulline supplementation results in reduced fatigue and improved endurance for both aerobic and anaerobic prolonged exercise.
Creatine Monohydrate (5 grams per serving)= Creatine is a molecule in an energy system (creatine phosphate) that can rapidly produce energy (ATP) to support cellular function. Thus its performance-enhancing and neuroprotective properties.
Taurine (1 gram per serving)= Taurine acts as both a cell protecting agent by modulating the cell membranes fluidity and health, as well as exerting anti-oxidant like effects. Taurine significantly reduces oxidative stress on cardiac muscle tissue in the presence of oxidative stress and can protect against damage from ischaemia-reperfusion injury in cardiac tissue.
L-Tyrosine (1 gram per serving)= L-Tyrosine is an amino acid that is used to produce noradrenaline and dopamine; supplemental appears to be anti-stress for acute stressors (which tend to deplete noradrenaline) and may preserve stress-induced memory deficits.
 
 

The Impact
By contributing to the growth of Krónos Nutrition, you will be helping to prove to the fitness industry that there is no need for these big brands to be overpricing their products without having the quality to match. We have spent months developing our idea and planning out our production costs and marketing techniques, and even at the low price that we will be offering our product at we will still be making good profit margins. We are here because we believe in our product and because we hope that others believe in it too. In order to break out of the fitness trap that is overpriced and ineffective supplements, we want to show the consumer that there are other healthier, cheaper, and more effective alternatives. By contributing to this campaign, you are joining the movement towards a better fitness experience for all.

Risks & Challenges
If the customer chooses to substitute our product for a similar one, there is not a lot stopping them. The same goes the other way around. In a market like this one, what keeps the customers coming to you is the strength of your brand. From the feedback we have gotten on Kronos Nutrition we have found that we are very popular amongst our audience and the people who have interacted with our company. Our product also comes in at such a low price and with such a range of beneficial ingredients that the customer would be giving up a large amount of money to switch between products.
Our competitors have a large presence both in stores and online, making our strategy key. While our competitors run a very mechanical and impersonal business, we will be interacting with our audience. Big supplement companies  who already have their brands at a level of high customer recognition and are doing sales at an increasing rate on an international basis are what we need to look out for. Our strategy should be to keep our sales on a domestic basis until we have enough capital to take it outside of the country, because when these companies hear about Kronos Nutrition and what we offer to the consumer it would be difficult to stop them from replicating our service and product and crowding us out of the market. While we are growing and trying to increase our cash inflow, it is important that we remain humble and conservative with our marketing strategies and stay in our domestic market until we are confident we can grow at a rate that will be immune to these companies trying to replicate our product.

This transmission is an integrated manual and automatic device of transmission, when there is no electricity or power can be whole manual variable speed, so as not to interfere. When fully charged can adjust for automatic transmission, then as long as the motor receives a signal, will always speed to achieve the needs of automatic transmission</p><h4>2.Transmission structure</h4><p>Transmission we adopt the integral structure of the gearbox, so whether it is manually or automatically, can be more stable, gearbox in the superposition gear and gear speed reducer structure, so that the motor is not easy to burn out, manual easier motor. We adopt the more stable structure to fix it. Gear materials more resistant to wear and use the combination of stainless steel and POM such more firmly</p><h4>3.Working principle of pedal</h4><p>Because pedal take seriously with more sophisticated sensors and foot because of frequent friction, so the requirements are very high, first use of materials and other products, material requirements become more solid, abrasion resistance, collision avoidance and product requirements do waterproof. So we do in the pedal transmission structure is more delicate. Inductive data transmission through the sensor, after calculation via Bluetooth to the transmission of the IC, IC after calculation, calculate the speed, motor function</p><h4>4.Pedal power supply</h4><p>Power supply using Panasonic 2032 power, continuous working time of at least 3 months</p><h4>5.Transmission power supply </h4><p>The transmission power, the use of independent power supply. At the same time, we designed a waterproof power supply box, placed inside the power supply, the power supply output by our unique circuit design, meanwhile, the power can also be from the power supply box take charge and power supply adopts the multi interface, can charge for our mobile phones, iPad. Power supply box with tie fixed in the car in the beam, and the use of the rubber pad, so that the power is not because of the turbulence inside circuit</p><h4>6.  I am a distributor.

<br/>
</div></div>","Short SummaryPlay with the pleasure of force and intelligent us we are a smart products R & D, this product is to improve the mountain bike gear design, this product can according to our feet force to change the transmission gear, eliminating the need for the product we also equipped with a manual part, when there is no electricity, can also be used in military operations, so that we can fully feel the manual transmission, the product inside a lot of gear structure and a connecting piece, make the product better transmission effect. At the same time, this product uses Bluetooth and some more advanced transmission equipment, hope to get your favorite, and look forward to your joining.What We Need & What You GetBreak it down for folks in more detail:We need about $150000  , including $50000 for products, mold development including plastic injection mold 3 sets, suppress the abrasive 1 set, one set of stamping die. $50000 for circuit board and program design. Another $5 0000 for materials and packaging design and procurement.Participation in the development of our products, we will give you low cost price. And give a mountain bike code table (the company's own development.）FAQ 1.How to achieve speed change?This transmission device is divided into left and right two, nine speed control of the left, the right to control the three speed, so it can be easily achieve the speed of 27 level. This transmission is an integrated manual and automatic device of transmission, when there is no electricity or power can be whole manual variable speed, so as not to interfere. When fully charged can adjust for automatic transmission, then as long as the motor receives a signal, will always speed to achieve the needs of automatic transmission2.Transmission structureTransmission we adopt the integral structure of the gearbox, so whether it is manually or automatically, can be more stable, gearbox in the superposition gear and gear speed reducer structure, so that the motor is not easy to burn out, manual easier motor. We adopt the more stable structure to fix it. Gear materials more resistant to wear and use the combination of stainless steel and POM such more firmly3.Working principle of pedalBecause pedal take seriously with more sophisticated sensors and foot because of frequent friction, so the requirements are very high, first use of materials and other products, material requirements become more solid, abrasion resistance, collision avoidance and product requirements do waterproof. So we do in the pedal transmission structure is more delicate. Inductive data transmission through the sensor, after calculation via Bluetooth to the transmission of the IC, IC after calculation, calculate the speed, motor function4.Pedal power supplyPower supply using Panasonic 2032 power, continuous working time of at least 3 months5.Transmission power supply The transmission power, the use of independent power supply. At the same time, we designed a waterproof power supply box, placed inside the power supply, the power supply output by our unique circuit design, meanwhile, the power can also be from the power supply box take charge and power supply adopts the multi interface, can charge for our mobile phones, iPad. Power supply box with tie fixed in the car in the beam, and the use of the rubber pad, so that the power is not because of the turbulence inside circuit6.  I am a distributor. How do I contact you?Enquiries regarding future distribution opportunities of Evapolar can be sent via email to kevin-manager@outlook.com. We will respond promptly.7.  What countries can Evapolar be delivered to?Evapolar can be delivered to any country. We included the cost of international shipping in all pledges. We want Evapolar to be available worldwide.ManufacturingWe need to finish tooling to manufacture different parts of the product. This process is complex and requires time and money. Complications could potentially emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule. To tackle this risk we carefully select each partner and always have a Plan B.  Revision ProcessWe want your feedback! Before we finalize our molding, give us feedback on what you want to see changed. Each week we will review all your requests and post updates. Just let us know!ShippingWe've given a conservative estimate for our delivery dates. We are committed to keeping you informed of our progress both during and following our campaign. We assure you that we are all working very hard to produce a sensational product that not only arrives on time but is of optimum quality!Thank you for your interest in EightClock!      Exercise heart rate watch

 lamps in rural Zambia contribute significantly to illness and death due
 to indoor air pollution and fires. They limit education, without the 
ability to study after dark, and they introduce significant CO2 
emissions. They increase poverty, a large percentage of a village 
household's income is spent on kerosene, and they limit commercial 
activities. You can break the cycle of poverty, ignorance and disease by
 providing affordable solar lighting to some of the world's poorest 
people.<br/><br/>The overall national access to electricity in Zambia as 
at 2010 is 20.4% with 48% in urban areas and 3.1 % in rural areas.​To 
this end, we will connect 400 houses with thatched roofs at Mununshi 
village in Mwansabombwe district under the Mununshi Solar Power 
Project.​ We will also erect 200 units of 20w, 30w and 40w Solar street 
lights using 6m and 8m poles at a distance of 25m between poles. In 
North-Western Province, about 130 houses with grass roofs at a village 
in Chavuma district will also be electrified.​<br/>This is an important 
programme which deserves a lot of support from government and its 
co-operating partners; however, the Government does not have the funds.<br/>We
 are happy to note that Credible Link will be connecting the houses and 
street lights free of charge​. This is what development is all about. It
 must have a direct impact on the vulnerable citizens such as rural 
households who have limited sources of income.<br/><br/>The community 
youth center have volunteered to support with labour, we are therefore 
appealing for donations to bring this dream to reality for hundreds of 
families living in this 21st century without access to light.<br/><strong>Solutions:</strong><br/>African

I am Dr. Carlo Oller, and I am an emergency physician with the YouTube channel 'DrERtv'.

My profession's worst curse is its effect on sleep. I have to work shift work that constantly changes, and includes night shifts (forcing me to sleep when the house is not dark, busiest, and warmest). I have always been fascinated with sleep mainly because I feel like I don't get enough of it or enough quality of it. Also, 3 years ago my wife was affected with encephalitis which affected my wife's memory and cognitive function. But it is her sleep patterns that have been most affected by the illness, resulting in an irritable mood, chronic fatigue, even depression. This has led me to study, and research the literature out there in search of solutions to improve sleep.

Through this personal search, I found that there has already been scientific evidence that has demonstrated that stimulating the brain with 'pink noise' during your deep sleep stage can actually amplify, and lengthen the duration of deep sleep stage. 
Various devices have been invented and are available on the market that you can place on your head. They will monitor your sleep waves and play the pink noise during this stage of sleep. However, they require the user to wear cumbersome headgear and whose cost is prohibitive for most (excess of $400-). 




What if we can harness the technology we already have (Fitbit and Apple watches) to hack into this pink noise ability to improve our deep sleep? NO big headgear, no big expenses.

This is what I am trying to create. An APP that has everything all the good ""sleep"" apps have, with the added benefit of NOT just monitoring your sleep. But to actually engineer it to improve it!
Although I am a physician I do not have the monetary resources to see this APP  turn into a reality. But with your contribution, we can all work together to see this 'dream' come true (pun intended).


What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

An APP that can work for both Fitbit and Apple watch will cost $12K to build for only the most basic function. I would like to include other features like:

white noise library (so that the user can play 'white noise'  on the background which would allow the 'pink noise' to fade in/out as the user enters and exits deep stages of sleep. 
the  function to create your own white noise for background playing


These added features would increase the cost of the APP built to an estimated $20K.
The sooner we raise the funds the sooner we can get to work, and launch the APP. That means the sooner we will all be hacking our deep sleep and improving it. 
 No matter if we reach our goal or not, the APP will be built so 100% of funds will go towards the development, launch, and promotion of the APP.


The Impact
The impact of this APP will be tremendous. It will let the users, using the social functions of the APP, to share, educate, challenge themselves and each other towards the best deep sleep of their lives. 

Risks & Challenges
The more money raised, the better APP we can create. More features, better functionalities, higher quality overall.

Optimal Nutrients. Not Optimal Supplements.
We refuse to use the term “supplements” to describe our product because Optimal Nutrients offers so much more.Let’s face it: the majority of people are likely chronically malnourished, simultaneously serving as living proof of the body’s resiliency. We are confident saying this because it was true for us at one time as well. We weren’t kind to our bodies. We were forcing our bodies to swim upstream and we never considered the consequences. By dropping the ball nutritionally, we dropped the ball in so many other areas of our lives. If this hits home for you, know it did for us while writing it. No one can make good choices for your body but you. You alone are in control of how you feel, how you think, and whether your body survives or thrives.Add to your already malnourished body the likelihood that you are also sleep deprived, dehydrated, stressed, and/or lacking consistent physical activity, we would bet there’s a very high chance you are missing out on Optimal health. Fortunately, we found an easy way to begin rectifying that.We aren’t offering what anyone else is... and we aren’t doing this the way anyone else has.Have you noticed how the “health and fitness” industry has been hijacked by protein powders, pre-workout formulas, fiber powders, etc. with who-knows what inside them? The whole industry seems like one big, hypocritical, money-grab!We're not like that. Actually, it’s partially because the industry is this way that we started Optimal.It’s no secret our soil and mass-produced foods are nutrient-deprived. So we created a product unlike anything else on the market to finally start giving ourselves what we deserve.1. We are fully transparent.For starters, we have nothing to hide and nothing to be ashamed of, because nothing but the absolute best goes into our products.Transparency is the foundational premise of our brand. We want you to know exactly what you're putting in your body. If it's in one of our products, you have a right to know why -- and because we have nothing to hide, we make it easy for you to do your due diligence. Simply go to our website to see for yourself the source and purpose behind each one of our Optimal ingredients. We believe in more information, not less; more education, not less; transparency, not playing off your ignorance.Some ingredients aren't vitamins. Some ingredients aren't minerals. So why are they in our recipes? Maybe they're flavorings. Maybe they're for shelf-life.

Because if we aren't transparent, what are we? www.optimalnutrients.com 2. We offer micronutrients, not macronutrients.So the first reason we stand out from the ""supplement crowd"" is our radical transparency.

But it's really our bioavailable sources that will make Optimal Nutrients stand out.Every single one of our products carries the Optimal Bioavailability Seal, certifying that they are made from the most bioavailable sources on the planet.Bioavailability refers to the amount of the nutrient that is actually absorbed.Imagine a plant. A cow comes along on a sunny day and eats the plant. Calcium is absorbed by the cow. Later on, we consume the dairy from that cow and, in turn, absorb calcium ourselves. But what happens if we bypass the dairy, pole-vault over the cow, and just eat the plant ourselves?We end up getting calcium from its PRIMARY source! This results in a much healthier, cleaner, and more effective (dare we say OPTIMAL) absorption of calcium! This is bioavailability, and every single one of Optimal Nutrients, literally 100% of them, are from their most primary sources on the planet.Look for the seal on all our packaging. When you find it, you know you're getting the absolute best source possible. Does your body deserve any less? Read more about our Optimal Plant Bioavailability Seal on our website.  4. Just pure goodness.Well, we saved the best for last. Optimal Nutrients are pure goodness: 100% Plant-based, Organic, Non-Gmo, Gluten-free, Vegan (Dairy-free, Shellfish-free, etc), Cruelty-free, and are made with 100% recycled cardboard. It really doesn’t get better than that.We believe it is our responsibility to be thoughtful about our packaging. In addition to using 100% recycled cardboard for our tube packaging, as a gift from us to you, each initial purchase will be accompanied by a gifted glass bottle to transfer your monthly product into (or use as you please).Ready to check out some product? We will be offering (6) products, (3) of which are stretch goals.Our first (3) products make up what we call The Optimal Triad. The Optimal Triad contains the entire micronutritional spectrum needed by the mind and body for Optimal health and wellbeing. As the creators, we have to say it feels amazing to see our Optimal Triad come to life! We are ecstatic about getting these incredible products into your hands.The first product in the Triad is our Optimal Vitamins + Minerals. Optimal Vitamins + MineralsThis is the product we are most proud to present. This is a bold statement, but we truly believe our Optimal Vitamin + Mineral complex is the most advanced, most comprehensive micronutritional formula in the world.  Next up:Optimal Bones, Joints + BeyondOur second product, the Optimal Bones, Joints + Beyond complex, is just as important as the Optimal Vitamin + Mineral formula. They both contain vitamins and minerals; just different ones for different purposes. And finally, our Optimal EFAs.Optimal Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs)Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) aren't micronutrients -- it's true -- but they're essential for a reason. The body cannot synthesize essential fatty acids. They must, therefore, be obtained through our nutritional regimen.Fish oil supplements have become extraordinarily popular, but fish oils are secondary sources. Remember what we learned about Optimal Bioavailability? This is why we chose primary sources like algae, seaweed, and avocado to make up our Optimal EFAs formula. These three incredible products -- Optimal Vitamins + Minerals, Optimal Bones, Joints + Beyond, and Optimal EFAs -- complete the Optimal Triad.Our hope is that they become a staple in your home and daily routine, as we want nothing less for you than Optimal wellness. News flash: Sweating without nutrification is nutritional suicide.We could give you a million reasons why you should be committed to a daily regimen of high quality micronutrients. For example: Did you know you lose a critical amount of micronutrients when you sweat? Are you diligent about replacing them? Check out this diagram:So many people think sweat is just salt and water. But as you can see, it is so much more! Sweat is a multi-micronutrient cocktail containing Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Vitamin C, Selenium, and much more. Your goal should always be to ""replace what you lose in sweat,"" so you're going to need far more than just water and whatever empty calories you grab from the grocery store.But don't sweat it -- this is just one of many reasons why we've created the Optimal Nutrients line. Like all ambitious and enthusiastic entrepreneurs, we have stretch goals! We believe wholeheartedly in the effectiveness of these products, which is why we are so motivated to get them to you! Introducing Optimal KidsOur Optimal Kids line consists of two products, Optimal Kid's Vitamins + Minerals and Optimal Kid's Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs). These two products are also available in two sets as you'll see below; all of which are stretch goals.Why Optimal Kids? Meeting the need of vitamins and minerals during childhood is critical, yet rarely accomplished. The younger you are, the more micronutrients you need. The constant state of growth children undergo makes optimizing their nutrition a top priority, and we want to help.Check out our Optimal Kid's products.Optimal Kid's Vitamins + MineralsAvailable as a stretch goal for $15!Growing is hard work, making optimized nutrition a top priority. The words Optimal Kids don't just speak to the names of our products... they speak to our goals. Featuring a Whole Food Blend of Kale, Flax Seed, Blueberries, Beets, and much more, we've found a comprehensive formula that we're confident your kids will love. Optimal Kid's Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs)Available as a stretch goal for $15!We'll keep this next one short because it's pretty simple: kids need essential fatty acids just like adults do! We are sincere in wanting what’s best for your kids, so we're committed to preventing deficiencies of EFAs in your little ones. And finally, perhaps the most important of all (since this is where it all begins).Optimal PregnancyAvailable as a stretch goal for $25!Having an Optimal pregnancy is of unparalleled importance. These are arguably the most critical (9)-months of development.But having an Optimal pregnancy is about more than just the health of the child -- it's also about the health of the mother! The reproductive system is extraordinary. Putting our children before ourselves begins long before birth; the mother's body automatically prioritizes the health of the fetus over her own -- transferring as many micronutrients as possible through the placenta.As an expecting mother, you now have two mouths to feed. Optimal Pregnancy will ensure there is an abundance of vitamins and minerals (and the right vitamins and minerals) to go around. Optimal UpbringingAvailable as a stretch goal for $25!We want to offer a package that combines Optimal Kid's Vitamins + Minerals with the Optimal Kid's EFAs. However, what we really want to offer is an opportunity. In addition to supplying your child's body with the raw materials it needs to grow and thrive, Optimal Upbringing is an opportunity to cement a crucial behavior into habit; the habit of self-care. An Optimal lifetime may be the holy grail, but it must start somewhere. For this reason, we are working to facilitate a healthy future by making Optimal Kids more effective and affordable. Optimal FamilyAvailable as a stretch goal for $89!This package combines the Optimal Triad (Optimal Vitamins + Minerals, Optimal Bones, Joints + Beyond, and Optimal Essential Fatty Acids) with our Optimal Upbringing; taking care of you and your little ones. Optimal Pregnancy CompleteAvailable as a stretch goal for $240!Optimizing one's pregnancy is obviously important, but facilitating pregnancy is often overlooked. We tend to think of pregnancy as a (9) month affair, but what about the months leading up to it?This (12) pack of Optimal Pregnancy is designed to help you create the healthiest, most hospitable environment possible, and it would be our pleasure to offer it to you at an Indiegogo special discount if we're able to reach our fundraising goal. In the best case scenario, we think it is viable to have product delivered to your door in (4) months. Our manufacturer has a guaranteed (90) day lead time on initial purchase orders, and beyond that, we'll have to navigate FDA compliance. Like all realistic time-tables, though, there will be unforeseen challenges; so in the spirit of transparency, we'll update you if we run into any hiccups.With transparency being the name of the game on Kickstarter (as well as our company motto), we want to walk you through exactly how we came up  with our budget.MOQAs for our minimum order quantities, we have to finance 1,500 initial units of each product from our manufacturer. If this was our only expense, our fundraising goal would be much smaller -- because in the purest form of Indiegogo spirit, we aren't looking to profit on these units at all. There are, though, additional costs we need to think about.INSURANCEObviously, we'll need insurance -- and unfortunately we anticipate that cost being significant.FDA COMPLIANCEUnderstanding the web of FDA regulations should probably be made simpler (just saying). Not taking any chances, however, we have budgeted to hire an FDA Compliance Attorney.NLEA INSPECTIONAll products must pass NLEA inspection (Nutritional Labeling and Education Act). Basically, we have to prove that what we're putting on the label is an accurate representation of our products. It's a simple, but necessary process.FULFILLMENTWe planned to do this ourselves to save money, but in terms of practicality, drop-shipping from our manufacturer is the only reliable option. If we're going to live up to the word Optimal, we can't be delaying shipments because we're busy learning on the job.FEESAll that remains are the fees associated with all successful campaigns; one for Indiegogo for providing this awesome service, and another for the processing fees between the bank and fundraising platform. This is why the ultimate goal exceeds the $66,725 figure.Your health is worth the investment.We don't just say that because we want your support. We say that because it is the truth. Monthly, would you be willing to forgo a night out with friends in order to prioritize your physical and mental health? Would you be willing to scratch the lottery tickets that never win (pun intended)? Either or, that's all it would take!With the help from Indiegogo, we can do something truly special and offer a great series of products for just over $2/day. That's less than your morning coffee on the way to work. Worth it if you ask us.Before you read this section, we want to be perfectly clear:100% of the dollars generously pledged through this Indiegogo campaign will go towards product development and fulfillment of our Optimal Nutrients.However, we wanted to share something that is near and dear to our hearts. Please watch this video: Once Optimal Nutrients is thriving in a sustainable way, our plan is to turn our focus (and extra profits) towards the proper funding of a charitable initiative we care deeply about -- Step Up Movement.Years ago we began offering free exercise classes at our local homeless shelter. What started with 2 participants quickly grew to over 100, and what was simply a fitness class evolved into a transformational program focusing on physical health, psychological wellbeing, and proper nutrition.The results have been astounding. We founded this 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization because of a responsibility we felt to help those on the margins of society, and this sense of duty only grows as we become more successful. Preventative healthcare is the future, and by virtue, we envision Step Up Movement at every homeless shelter across the country. So, as charitably motivated people, we intend to donate a significant portion of our future revenues in an effort to properly fund this program.If you'd like to learn more or get involved, please email Guy at contact@guywaltman.comThis is either the time for a closing statement, or an invitation for more. As a closing statement, let us just briefly thank you. If you've read this far, clearly, we have your time and consideration to be grateful for. Also, thank you for caring enough about your health to think Optimally!We thought you might like to meet the team. You can read more about each of us on our website, but our names are Guy, Meryem, Kate, and Paula. We aren't big on titles. All you really need to know is that we are fully committed to bringing you the best products humanly possible.This isn't just the Optimal Team. This is YOUR team. We created Optimal Nutrients not just for our family's and ourselves, but for you and yours as well. When we say we are here for you, we mean it. As for an invitation for more; we don't want to this to stop once you get our product in your hands. Instead, we hope this will be the beginning of an amazing relationship! We are easy to get ahold of, and we hope you'll reach out.Don't believe us? Call our bluff. Reach out to the team at www.optimalnutrients.com or try the contact portal on www.guywaltman.com to reach Guy directly. You can also send a message to connect with Paula at www.paulasitek.com. As people who enjoy meaningful conversation, we look forward to hearing from you; and hopefully, while we're at it, serving you to our greatest ability!",43.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Chronic Wound Management</h3>
<p> I have spent over 20 years in the medical field. I have worked in and around the field of wound care as a nurse wound consultant for over 14 years. This was a field that found me wanting. Wanting to understand how this public health challenge could be so profound yet invisible to the world. The costs of treating are in the billions annually. Worst of all, this field of medicine is not included in any disciplines primary school. Hundreds-of-thousands of nurses and doctors, in the US alone, are treating people without the proper knowledge or education to do so. Thus driving up the costs, causing people to go months and even years with open, smelly, chronic wounds and worst of all, amputations. Tens-of-thousands of amputations are done annually due to non-healing chronic wounds. In some cases the incidence of chronic wounds are higher than those of breast cancer. </p>
<p>Just in my short time of practice in this field, I have helped people with non-healing chronic wounds, present for as long as 18 years, heal in a matter of months. I have spent countless hours learning and educating myself in this field. I am currently a registered nurse and a Diplomate of the American Board of Wound Management along with many other current and past certifications in the field. I already have an outreach website, healthtoheal.org and a face book page; Health to Heal, where I have been a part of caring for people and educating clinicians in 10 different countries. I can say with the upmost certainty that this is also a world wide health crisis. Because there is such a knowledge deficit, I call wound care the worst field in medicine. Further, wound care can be considered just as much of an art as it is a medicine. We even lack the abundance of research that is afforded most every other area of medicine due to the ethical principles of medical research.</p>
<p>I have developed a tool for this field. This tool will instantly increase and improve the accuracy of chronic wound treatment in the hands of any user. By answering just a few questions my app will give a minimum of 4 recommendations of dressing types, cleansing agents and topical products that guide the user to successful management of chronic wounds. I already have a working algorithm on paper. It is ready to be written into code and published for use. Once the app is created, there will also be a corresponding website in which to contact me via email for any other information, for which I will offer at no additional cost. </p>
<p>The Wound Guru, is the name of the app. I am told that this app is not complicated and will be on the lower side of typical app development costs. I am seeking $15,000.00 for this project. I plan to make this app available for a very small monetary cost. For the first 30 days the app will be free of charge. Afterwards I will establish a monthly subscription of $10.00 or less for the app's use.  Any member that downloads the app will have the ability to email me directly with any challenges they may find in there practice. I already do this for free through my Health to Heal Outreach Program, helping 4-6 people a month. The Wound Guru is another way for me to be able to reach more and more clinicians and people struggling with chronic wounds.</p>
<p>I am speaking with developers currently and thus far have received quotes in the range of $12,000 to $15,000. I am also proposing to the developers an opportunity to build and splitting the cost as a buy in option. Any funds afforded to me in these donations will get applied directly to the development of the app. This project is fluid and I am open to any means of assistance to move forward with The Wound Guru.</p>

<p>Some of us really don’t like laugh tracks and wondered if a device could be built to remove the canned laughter. As scientists with expertise in image and audio signal processing, as well as speech and vocalization analysis, we were all intrigued.  Undesirable canned laughter is definitely a “sound” issue – which is right up our alley.  A survey of others revealed this was a common issue.  Over 80% of our survey audience replied that laugh tracks on television shows annoyed them.  Armed with that insight, we decided to design a simple do-it-yourself solution that anyone could use with his/her own TV.</p>
<p></p>
<div style=""color:#257A93;""><b>Kill The Cann (KTC) reduces or removes laughter from the television audio using our advance signal processing algorithm (patent pending).

the performers get one channel – which they share with the middle of the

<p>In our processing, each of the audience tracks and the

<p>Afterward, the bass and music/special effects channels are

 What if you could “kill” the canned laughter of your favorite sit-com?

What if you could remove audience sounds like
laughter and declare yourself free of “programmed response” to laugh only when
you feel like it?



Some of us really don’t like laugh tracks and wondered if a device could be built to remove the canned laughter. As scientists with expertise in image and audio signal processing, as well as speech and vocalization analysis, we were all intrigued.  Undesirable canned laughter is definitely a “sound” issue – which is right up our alley.  A survey of others revealed this was a common issue.  Over 80% of our survey audience replied that laugh tracks on television shows annoyed them.  Armed with that insight, we decided to design a simple do-it-yourself solution that anyone could use with his/her own TV.

Kill The Cann (KTC) reduces or removes laughter from the television audio using our advance signal processing algorithm (patent pending). It works with existing HDMI streaming devices like your DVR and Chromecast. Simply connect the HDMI cable of your DVR to our device and then connect it to your TV. It is very simple to use. Just turn on the switch to remove laughter in any show you are watching.

The available audio tracks of a multi-track television program are processed to remove or reduce certain components of the program, especially audience sounds.  This applies to any program which is supplied with several audio channels, whether provided by cable, DVD, Internet streaming, or otherwise.


How it Works

A single, multi-channel electronic audio stream enters from the

The strawberries and cherries are purchased from small local farmers and the blueberries are wild, we personally gather them from the mountains. The fruits are grown very carefully into an Eco-Friendly environment, without artificial fertilizer and into a healthy soil.<br/><br/>Because

It can be yourself or someone you truly care about. Out OFF The BOX is a great self-development tool, and also, an excellent gift for someone who might spend too much time on their phone. The Out OFF The BOX journey is most effective if performed together in a support group.Out OFF The BOX is for everybody who might suffer from nomophobia. Nomophobia is a state of stress we feel when we can't get access to our phone. We can't find the phone for a couple of seconds, we ran out of battery, there's no data connection, we forgot the phone at home.  We get anxious, even if the situation lasts only for a short period of time.Phone addiction can take many shape and form. You might spend a lot of time on social media, or checking the latest news, playing games, chatting with your friends, taking food pictures, etc. The methodology of Out OFF The BOX is applicable for all types of dependency. We believe the key to change your behavior is to become a conscious user instead of twiddling with your phone in autopilot mood, and constantly train those consciousness muscles to maintain a healthy relationship with technology.Out OFF The BOX is the phone diet for people hungry for life. It’s especially beneficial for people who have ever considered taking part in a digital detox, digital diet, unplugging day or an offline Sabbath. What is included in Out OFF The BOX?Out OFF The BOX will lead you through a 3-step program with the help of 16 tangible tools.Step 1: In the KICK OFF phase, first, we diagnose your starting point with the help of the How OFF are you? Survey. Then we ask you to define what you want to achieve with the program and make a pledge with Pledge OFF. Finally, we encourage you to find a buddy supporting you throughout your journey, and request his or her help by handing over the OFF buddy pin.Step 2: The deepest part of your journey is the GO OFF phase. First of all, we invite you to take part in a 30-day OFF challenge with one task for each day. To support this, we include several tools:

Functional tools:

Alarm clock, so your phone is not the first thing you see in the morning

Phone hanger bag, so you can get your phone out of your sight and leave it in the lobby

Journal, to rediscover the joy of handwriting and self-reflection

Technical tips, so you can set up your phone in a way that best supports your mission



Inspirational tools:

Phone sticker, to remind you about the intent, feelings and urges you want to satisfy with your phone

Inspiration cube, to get some additional boost when you feel like giving up



Recreational tools:

Nonogram puzzle, to rediscover your creative self

Coloring book with colorful pencils to relearn how to focus

OFF Bookmark, to re-establish reading as a regular habit


Step 3: In the HOLD OFF phase, we celebrate and focus on maintaining all the results you have achieved. We invite you to retake the How OFF are you? Survey, celebrate your journey with a small surprise gift, and share your experiences on a handwritten postcard.The User's guide will lead you through the whole Out OFF The BOX journey step by step. It will explain the scientific evidence why the actual step matters and how the elements of Out OFF The BOX will help you reach the given step.  Who are behind Out OFF The BOX?Out OFF The BOX was created by Bori Kovacs and Eszter Baur, a product designer and a management consultant who have been friends for almost a decade. Out OFF The BOX is a personal mission for us.

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p>My name is Kristin Rulon. I am a severe post partum depression and anxiety survivor. After I took the birth control shot, I developed severe PPD/PPA and was told it took take up to two years to back to myself. It's been more than three years now and I have recovered but I have PTSD and anxiety from the experience. Through my research and personal development work, I have been consulting with mental health professionals to build an app that will reward all forms of self-care, building awareness and self-compassion through every-day experiences.</p>
<p>With a husband in the military and a son on the spectrum, I also saw a need for people to connect solely on health concerns. Many people are afraid to share their concerns with those closest to them for fear of judgement, Mind Star will give people the chance to connect on issues and build a lifeline of true support, hopefully, pull people out of isolation and remind them that they are not alone. It's not your mental health, it's not my mental health - it's our mental health and it's time we start thinking about mental health that way. </p>
<p>The average age that someone was diagnosed with depression in the 1960s was 40, now the average age of someone being diagnosed with depression is 14. One in 5 adults will experience a serious mental health concern that will affect how they live their life. One in 25 adults will experience a mental health concern in their lifetime. These statistics aren't getting any better and we need to start showing people how to love themselves because studies show that those with more self-compassion are more compassionate to others. Studies also show that people who are more giving, more altruistic lead happier lives than those who don't think of others. </p>
<h3>If You Support Mind Star</h3>
<p>If you contribute toward Mind Star you will get an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at building an app, you will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>A weekly newsletter with mental health tips; </li>
<li>A vote in some of the many awesome decisions our team will be making as we build the app; and</li>
<li>Progress reports, including my successes and frustrations, as we build. You will be with me every step of the way. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you donate financially to Mind Star, you are giving back to everyone, to help build an app that will change the world. I know that's bold to say but that's what I believe. People need to stop beating themselves up and taking care of themselves in a way we were meant to, not the way society teaches us. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I dream about taking this app to a global-level, where it can help people learn or relearn their value in the world, and take away the stigma that self-care is selfish. We can't pour (love) the way we want to from an empty tea cup. We have to refill our cup every day with our own unique self-care routine and the truth is - most people don't even think about a building a unique self-care routine that works for them. Mind Star will help people build awareness and show them it takes more than just eating healthy and going to the gym to life a full, happy life. You have to be in a good mental space to make real changes and the good news is that it doesn't take much effort to rewire the brain, we just think it does ... and Mind Star can help. </p>
<p><strong>Real talk: Many female entrepreneurs don't receive funding for their projects.</strong></p>
<p>It's true, the numbers are depression but honestly, it doesn't scare me. I'm more concerned about the regret if I told give my all and build Mind Star. I've been told who I should be my entire life. And as much as it is hard to say, my darkest days brought out the warrior in me and not only showed me who I am but who I am meant to be. God made me a fighter, a stubborn woman who doesn't believe in no. When I hear the word ""no,"" and trust me I hear it a lot, I think ""onto to the next one."" There are more than one way to do things and I don't give up easily.  If people gave up easily, we wouldn't have half the things we enjoy today.</p>

<li>give people a “thumbs up”</li>
<li>talk or rant at no one</li>
<li>communicate in memes or gifs</li>

Instead of building and cherishing relationships, our socializing and self-worth now focuses on the number of likes we get. <strong>We’ve traded connection—real relationships—for likeability.</strong> Likeability doesn’t sustain us, yet we’ve been made to believe that the quantity of our likes or followers will make us feel better.

As a Social Purpose Corporation, doing good is at the core of our business.



 
Social media has distorted what socializing means. It’s gone from really getting to know someone and feeling like they know you, to marketing yourself.Think about what we do online to try to connect:
give people a “thumbs up”
talk or rant at no one
communicate in memes or gifs
share every detail
put on disguises/masks/filters
post selfies and food pics
pretend we’re someone we’re not
share articles
watch people’s lives
Now, imagine what it would be like to do those things with people in person. Are you picturing it? Kind of silly or weird, right? Maybe even a little creepy?And often algorithms decide whether our community sees what we have to share in the first place.  In general, social media is a news feed. It updates us on the parts of people’s lives that they choose to show us.Knowing what’s going on in a person’s life is different than feeling like others know you.Feeling known, understood, that’s what helps us feel really connected.Rather than being curious, social beings that truly interact, we’ve had to become experts at marketing ourselves—the assumption being that we are only valuable if enough people “buy” us. Instead of building and cherishing relationships, our socializing and self-worth now focuses on the number of likes we get. We’ve traded connection—real relationships—for likeability. Likeability doesn’t sustain us, yet we’ve been made to believe that the quantity of our likes or followers will make us feel better. Instead, we should be building better quality relationships.Social media has become exhausting and draining—often making people feel and act worse, not better. Phaant’s goal is to change that. How?Phaant brings a refreshing approach to how we interact with each other on social media, through collaborative storytelling and shared memories. It’s designed to be more like what we’d expect from good in-person experiences—the kind that build us up and help us feel like a part of something bigger.Many of our life stories go beyond our individual memories. Has a friend ever shared a fond memory about you that you had completely forgotten about? We have so many wonderful experiences hidden from memory that can be brought back while swapping stories with friends and family. We may think “How did I forget about that!?” and wish we could bring back more of those lost memories—those parts of who we are. Imagine how many of your experiences with friends and family have been forgotten by them. You may be the one person with the key to unlock those forgotten memories, and bring back those lost joys from our shared pasts. Help us change social media for the better. Donate. By becoming an early supporter of Phaant, you will be a part of the story and can have a keepsake from ours.By achieving our goal of $30,000, we intend to put the finishing touches on our prototype and complete initial testing.

<p>The <strong>keto </strong>diet is a <strong>low-carb</strong>, high-fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and low-carb diets. The goal of keto diets is to get your body into a state of <strong><i>ketosis</i> </strong>-- the metabolic process that burns stored fat for energy instead of glucose (sugar). To reach <i><strong>ketosis</strong></i>, and maintain it, you should usually monitor and track your body’s <strong>ketone </strong>levels.</p>

The leading focus is on fighting SARS-CoV-2 and all the new viruses in the future, by joining research workers around the world for understanding better the 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), to accelerate the open science effort to develop new life-saving therapies.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">It’s giving us the possibility for simulating protein dynamics, how the coronavirus proteins work, and how to develop therapeutics to stop them or treat.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Our project partly derives from the idea that guided the creators of the long-running project SETI@home, which is unfortunately ending the volunteer program this month. It uses distributed computing to analyze radio telescope data in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Clearly graphics cards are mainly intended for video editing, gaming and even mining of cryptocurrency. But not everyone knows that they can “donate” their AMD Radeon or Nvidia GPU’s spare compute cycles to analyze and possibly help to fight against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic?</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Software that we develop uses the spare CPU and GPU cycles of thousands of game consoles, smartphones and computers, globally to simulate computational antidote design and protein folding.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Viruses include proteins that they use to repress human immune systems and multiply themselves. To follow coronavirus behavior, we want to comprehend how these viral proteins work and how we can invent therapeutics to cure it and eventually stop them.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Corona@home can make use of computer simulations to recognize a protein’s moving parts. After that, scientists have a firm grasp on how the atoms move and cooperate within a protein, they can proceed much more closer to explore therapeutics to treat it.<br/>Simulations like that, demand massive computational power. And our project Corona@home can carry out compute power as possible at fighting SARS-CoV-2.<br/>Because of this networked supercomputer, research workers can project proteins at the level of individual atoms in a fraction of the time, it might take even one powerful computer. Many important biological processes that proteins perform take place over milliseconds to a few seconds. A lot of important biological processes that proteins carry out take places over milliseconds to a few seconds.That might seem short, but measuring atoms as they bounce off one another depends upon time scales in femtoseconds — one quadrillionth of a second.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">To model just one millisecond of folding, even average-size protein, on a top-of-the-line PC, it can take like 500 years, but thanks to the possibility of Corona@home, we can split these problems into many individual parts. At the same time we can send them for example to 1,000 people at the same time . Running those calculations in parallel, we can take these problems that would have taken 500 years and instead deal with them in months.<br/>Corona@home serves could be a starting point for new drug design.At this time, scientists often have only one well-known protein structure to analyze. For example, Beta lactamase is a protein that some bacteria deploy to conserve themselves from antibiotics like penicillin. The protein has a long-studied and well-documented structure. But this structure is only about a single snapshot of beta lactamase at one moment in time.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">That snapshot contains valuable information, but it’s kind of like seeing a picture of a construction vehicle in a parking lot and trying to guess what it does. Really, what you would like is to watch this thing move around and see how it works together with other machinery to, say, build a building. We’re interested in watching how every atom in a protein moves — as it’s being assembled for the first time and as it goes about its jobs. The atoms in a protein are never still, they’re constantly jostling and moving around. And one genetic mutation changes maybe a dozen atoms out of thousands.

<h2>CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIA – HOW YOU CAN HELP?</h2>
</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><p>You can simulate the dynamics of COVID-19 proteins to hunt for new therapeutic opportunities</p><p>2019-nCoV behaves in a similar way and it is very similar to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For both coronaviruses, mostly the first step of infection takes place in the lungs, when a protein on the area of the virus binds  to a receptor protein on a lung cell. The name of this viral protein is spike protein, present in red on the image below, and the receptor is known as ACE2. There is known one kind of protein – therapeutic antibody, it has the possibility to block the viral protein from binding to its receptor, and also can stop the virus from infecting the lung cell. There is already developed therapeutic antibody for SARS-, but to develop small molecules or  therapeutic antibodies for 2019-nCoV, researchers need to better know the structure of the viral spike protein and how it binds to the human ACE2 receptor required for viral entry into human cells.</p><p>Proteins are not stagnant—they wiggle and fold and unfold to take on numerous shapes.  We need to study not only one shape of the viral spike protein, but all the ways the protein wiggles and folds into alternative shapes in order to best understand how it interacts with the ACE2 receptor, so that an antibody can be designed. Low-resolution structures of the SARS-CoV spike protein exist and we know the mutations that differ between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV.  Given this information, we are uniquely positioned to help model the structure of the 2019-nCoV spike protein and identify sites that can be targeted by a therapeutic antibody. We can build computational models that accomplish this goal, but it takes a lot of computing power.   </p><p>This is where you can contribute! With many computers working towards the same goal, we aim to help develop a therapeutic remedy as quickly as possible. Being part of Corona@Home, you can help provide us with the computational power required to tackle this problem. One protein from 2019-nCoV, a protease encoded by the viral RNA, has already been crystallized. Although the 2019-nCoV spike protein of interest has not yet been resolved bound to ACE2, our objective is to use the homologous structure of the SARS-CoV spike protein to identify therapeutic antibody targets.</p><p>We can benefit from supercomputing power, scientific software framework and improved protein structure prediction using potentials from deep learning as a part of machine learning (see the section: DEEP LEARNING – IMPROVE PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION).</p><h3><strong>COVID-19 research currently in development</strong></h3><p>Corona@home is in contact with medical research organizations to provide them computing and deep learning power, to expedite the discovery and rollout of tests, treatments and cures.</p><p>According to The Milken Institute, who created aggregation of publicly available information from validated sources, we track a <a href=""https://milkeninstitute.org/covid-19-tracker"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">comprehensive online tracker</a> (<a href=""https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf</a>)  that looks at all of the COVID-19 research currently in development.

<h2>SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND</h2></figcaption></figure><p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The essential component for many biological functions is protein. It takes actions in biological functions and participates in virtually all processes within biological cells. Commonly they behave like enzymes, carrying out biochemical reactions including cell signaling, cellular regulation and molecular transportation. Some act as a type of antibodies, others as a skeleton for cells and some proteins participate in the immune system. </span></p><div data-element_type=""widget"" data-id=""34d72b3c"" data-widget_type=""text-editor.default""><div><div>

<p>First, before protein is allowed to take these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure. This process is mostly spontaneous and depends on interaction within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their area.</p>
<p>Its very important to understanding how protein works and behave, and it is recognized as a holy grail of computational biology. Usually when in a crowded cellular environment folding is happening, the process passes smoothly. But, when due to a protein’s chemical characteristic or other factors, proteins can misfold. It means when protein fold down in the wrong way and end up deformed. If cellular mechanisms do not have the ability to refold misfolded proteins or destroy them, then they can aggregate and cause different diseases.</p>
<p>Because of complicatication of proteins conformation and also configuration space, and limits of computing power., stimulation of all-atom molecular dynamics have been very limited in the timescale.</p>
<p>Most proteins before 2010 mostly fold in the order of milliseconds, and simulation could only be done nanosecond to microsecond timescales. Power of supercomputers of usually have been used for simulating protein folding. But this operation was very expensive and mostly only shared among many research groups. Protein folding is not one step process. In some cases folding time of protein is nearly 96%, waiting in various intermediate <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_conformation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">conformational</a> states, each a local <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_free_energy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thermodynamic free energy</a> minimum in the protein’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_landscape"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">energy landscape</a>.</p>
<p>Folding@home is using conformations of a process known as adaptive sampling, and it is their starting point for a set of simulation trajectories. With every discovery of conformations made by simulations, trajectories are restarted from them and from this process is slowly created the Markov state model (MSM).</p>
<p>The length of the proteins that has studied Folding@home during 2000 and 2010 have increased by a factor of four, while its timescale of protein folding have increased by six orders of magnitude. Folding@home in 2002 started to use Markov state models to gather approximately a million CPU days of simulation over the span of a few months.</p>
<p>MSMs correlated another simulation in 2011 that required an aggregate of 10 million CPU hours of computing. Folding@home used MSMs in January 2010, to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-residue NTL9 protein out to 1.52 milliseconds, it was timescale compatible with experimental folding rate predictions. But it was a thousand times longer than achieved in the first place. Model was built with individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, this was providing an unparalleled level of many details into the protein’s energy area.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS PROTEIN FOLDING</h2>
</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><p>Protein folding it is a physical process consisting of formation by a polypeptide (it owns a structure of random coil) highly organized structure with a characteristic and stable conformation.</p><p>Each protein is assumed to be in the form of an unstructured polypeptide chain shortly after translation. Such a polypeptide does not show the presence of a well-defined, stable spatial structure. It is only due to the interaction between adjacent amino acids that the polypeptide begins to adopt a specific conformation, often referred to as the “native” state. It is currently believed that the main factor determining the native structure of a given protein is its amino acid sequence, however, some observations indicate that the natural structure of proteins found in a living cell may be dependent on interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids.</p><div><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-x2Qtqe2dPKj5cQ97qp2GaCZdeG87ZT3GfZvQ00qwRjkDkfw2zEQ8WsQRJNTbyv3UGLGS6c7PJFJe91LuZzO-VDlODL8195vg81f0O1WUwBUEyVjsGvcSOeK7ofTMSp1yP0_ulrF"" src=""""/><p> </p>

This is the biggest dilmate for researchers, because the structure of protein in a big group regulate its function, but still structures of protein can be very hard to set experimentally. The last major progression of these studies has been achieved through the use of genetic information. We can predict which of the amino  acid remains are in interconnection. This can be reached by analyzing covariance in homologous sequences, which helps in predicting given protein structures.It gave us the chance to teach a neural network. Thanks to that, we have the ability to make accurate good forecasting of the distances between pairs of residues. This date includes much more information about structure than contact predictions. Applying this information, we have the ability to formulate a potential of power that can precisely portray the shape of a protein. This potential  we can form by a simple gradient descent algorithm to bring out structures without complex sampling procedures. </p><p>By uncovering the prognosis of the structure of several poorly studied proteins related with  SARs-Cov_2- the virus that causes COVID-19, we can contribute to the development of science associated with this. We point, that these projections have not been scientifically confirmed. But we hope that they may do something for science associated with viruses functions and help with making hypothesis generation platform for future experimental work in developing therapeutics. </p><p>For half a century  research workers had the ability to specify patterns of proteins in laboratories using magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and also nuclear magnetic resonance. But error and trials  appear in each of these methods, and costs tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per each protein structure and also it can take many years of research. That is why AI methods are chosen by biologists as a shorter path for  process for difficult proteins. They have two options. In the first they work on genetic code and thanks to this can predict the shape of the protein – faster and more reliable method. The second option available is to determine the protein with the help of long and costly experiments.</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7lRA0UM1belrg_PkxfmVZdacxEgiwTPjuoL0d7eak4GIE9k3LWUaLjEgyXzb42fb4En76JN1yXvFydJg_z4DVU_TxbF_X58VnQpahLDNLL9yht4uW0qCS8DH8LDdIl4tERyF0CXa"" src=""""/></figure><p><strong>How can AI make a difference?</strong></p><p><br/>Thanks to rapid reduction in the cost of genetic sequencing the field of genomics is much more rich in data.The effect shows in deep  learning and it approaches the prediction problem that rely on genomic data have become increasingly successful in the last years. Biennial global competition called the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) was established in 1994. The CASP has been created to accumulate measure and research progress on the newest methods to accomplish better accuracy of predictions .</p><p> </p><p>In the center of interest for  AI teams is mainly the problem of modeling target shapes from zero, and without using previously solved proteins as patterns. AI teams  gained a high degree of precision, during predicting the physical properties of a protein structure, and then used two separate methods to create predictions of full protein structures. </p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/mXbNd_4aXTqQGyAScxcL69tPl23y9VD_0uRM3Y24m7fzcnZPLul_5RUvNcmxRoeVEpj6-YGmUnHnXAiPQJ8VWktdXboAHjGUiohwmLi5bCpNaKS1f46OMZK0i416MNex0IJt7uQU"" src=""""/></figure><p><strong>Using neural networks to predict physical properties</strong></p><p>Deep neural networks that are trained to predict properties of the protein form its genetic sequence – these two methods are based on this. The properties networks predict are: (a) the distances between pairs of amino acids and (b) the angles between chemical bonds that connect those amino acids.</p><p> The first development is a progression of generally used techniques that estimate whether pairs of amino acids are near each other. A skilled neural network can predict a distribution of distances between every pair of residues in a protein (visualised in Figure 2). These probabilities were then combined into a score that estimates how accurate a proposed protein structure is. We can also train a single neural network that uses all distances in aggregate to estimate how close the proposed structure is to the right answer.</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SFLSPOEapkvpXOfHwX6gbCoStNPVrD3O7Pbj2npMPc_4ngslWsGy43kf1PW3Q6fRNMKIBpCqinyxVea2jdMS8WPL_-RKOszsSrCm6yYoXVmsFDHlCaw5lgXKyuCElPMNs79jZiG2"" src=""""/></figure><p>FIGURE 2: Two ways of visualising the accuracy of prediction.

Importantly, these match well on both global and local scales. The bottom panels represent the same comparison using 3d models, featuring predictions (blue) versus ground-truth data (green) for the same three proteins. </p><p>Because of the ability to use  these scoring functions, we can look for protein shape  and try to find structures that match our predictions. </p><p>In the first method, which  is built on techniques usually used in structural biology, and repeatedly substituted parts of a protein structure with new protein fragments.

This technique was applied to entire protein chains rather than to pieces that must be folded separately before being built up into a bigger structure, to simplify the prediction process.</p><p>We are amazed  by the prosperity of the protein folding model, but still there is a lot of work before us in the realm of protein biology. We really want to find a way to establishing methods that AI can cooperate to fundamental scientific discovery.</p><p>Because of that kind of thinking, it will lead us in the end to improve understanding about how it works and will be helpful for scientists to target and construct new, effective treatments for diseases in an improved way. Scientists have only mapped structures for about half of all the proteins made by human cells. There are a lot of rare diseases with mutation in a single gene, and this results in a malformed protein which can have  intense outcome on the health of an entire organism. </p><p>This method probably has the ability to help us and reachers workers to find efficient drug discovery, and during this reducing the costs associated with experimentation. In our hearts, we hope that thanks to using AI for disease research could be useful and helpful to improve quality of life for millions of patients all over the globe. But advantages from it are not only restricted for health issues. Great knowledge about protein folding can also be of some use for instance  in advances in biodegradable enzymes – this can be done by protein design. This research could help us manage pollutants like oil and plastic, and support us in breaking down waste in ways that are more friendly to our earth. Some scientists have already begun engineering bacteria to single proteins that will make waste biodegradable and much more easier to process. Machine learning systems can integrate various sources of information about protein folding  – this significant data can help scientists come up with solutions to complex problems in a faster way. As we know how AI can help people master complex games through systems like AlphaGo and AlphaZero, We think AI breakthroughs will help serve as a platform to advance our knowledge of essential, scientific dilemmas in a much quicker way. </p><p>It is very interesting and exciting to be witness  to these signs of progress in protein folding, improving the utility of AI for scientific discovery. There is still numerous work and a lot of  research to do before we are able to have a significant effect on treating diseases, managing waste, and more and more… and we know the potential of it is  tremendous.</p><p> </p><section data-element_type=""section"" data-id=""b06999a""><div><div><div data-element_type=""column"" data-id=""fa67ab4""><div><div><div data-element_type=""widget"" data-id=""fd4afd6"" data-widget_type=""text-editor.default""><div><div>

<h2>Corona@home’s DEV and system architecture</h2>
<p> </p>
</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><p>Corona@home system involves five components: work units, core, server/grid of the masternodes, client/wallet and tools (client for mobile phones and nextgen video game consoles from Sony and Microsoft planned in the future)</p><h3><strong>Work units</strong></h3><p>A work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and fully processed by a users computer, it is returned to Corona@home servers, which then award the user with  credit points and this cycle is automatic. All work units have linked deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this gives  the overall simulation process to proceed in a normal way if a work unit is not returned after a sensible period of time. Because of these deadlines  the minimum system demand for Corona@home is a Pentium 3 450 MHz CPU with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). Major advantage of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly competing simulations that’s why work units for high-performance clients have a  much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client.</p><p>Before public release, work units go through several quality assurance steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Corona@home. Work units from Corona@home’s are typically processed only once, except in the uncommon event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.The Corona@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.</p><h3><strong>Core</strong></h3><p>The calculations on the work unit are made by specialized molecular dynamics programs as a background process.  Major amount of Corona@home’s cores are lean on GROMACS(GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations). It is one of the powerful and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which mostly rely on manually optimized assembly language code and hardware optimizations.To enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update the core is separated from the clienti. When work of cores is interrupted can resume work from  point upon startup that is why cores periodically create calculation checkpoints. GROMACS is a comprehensive package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles.</p><p>It is  mostly designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is very fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.</p><p>GROMACS assists  all the standard algorithms you expect from modern molecular dynamics implementation.  In the code a lot of algorithmic optimizations have been introduced. For example, extract the calculation of the virial from the innermost loops over pairwise interactions, and they use their own software routines to calculate the inverse square root.</p><p>In GROMACS 4.6 and up, on almost all common computing platforms, the innermost loops are written in C using inner  functions that the compiler transforms to SIMD machine instructions, to utilize the accessible instruction-level parallelism. These kernels are available in  single and also double precision, and assist all the different kinds of SIMD support found in x86-family processors.</p><p><a href=""http://www.gromacs.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gromacs.org</a></p><h3><strong>Client/Wallet</strong></h3><p>Users of Corona@home install a client/wallet program on their  personal computer (mobile devices and next gen game consoles – future roadmap). Participant collaborate with the client, which manages other software or masternodes components in the background.Throughout the client/wallet, the user may stop and pause the folding process, open an event log, and check work development  or also view personal statistics. Computers of clients run uninterruptedly in the background at a low priority, by using idle processing power and because of that clients computer normal work is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.The client connects to a Corona@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client’s settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Corona@home servers. </p><p>Computer clients are conformable to uniprocessors and multi-core processor systems, and also graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Corona@home with the ability to successfully complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.</p><p>Professional software developers are responsible for Corona@home’s code, both for the client and server-side.  While the client’s graphical user interface (GUI) is open-source,<sup> </sup>the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons. </p><h3>CLIENT/WALLET FOR MOBILE PHONES ( ROADMAP Q3 2020)</h3><p>1. Monitor the progress and status of your folding slots while not being near your systems. It will also enable you to change settings of the configuration of your folding systems or visualize proteins in 3D on your computer or servers which they work on.</p><p>2. Due to the progressively increasing performance of top smartphones (e.g based on Snapdragon 865 with Adreno 650 GPU or Apple A13 Bionic with A13 Bionic’s GPU), we plan to include Android and iOS apps and implement mobile devices in the Corona@home’s distributed computing ecosystem.</p><h3><strong>SERVER / MASTERNODE</strong></h3><p>Masternodes serve as the integrity of Corona@home’s blockchain ecosystem, stakeable CORO passive income and a grid of distributed supercomputers to simulate and predict the dynamics of proteins.</p><p>For volunteering and network grid using API, an open-source middleware system  is anticipated – Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC).</p><p>At first it was used to support the SETI@home, but this platform became resultful in a novel and inventive way for other applications in  various fields of science like mathematics, medicine, molecular biology, climatology, astrophysics, linguistics. The target of BOINC is to provide researchers to step into the enormous processing resources of multiple personal computers around the world.</p><p>Scientific computations are run on users’ computers. After sending the user from the client to the scientific researchers database, the backend server checks and analyzes the results. The validation process engage  running all tasks on computers with multiple collaborators and comparing results.  </p><p>BOINC provides APIs for various types of applications and web sites that interact with BOINC components:</p><ul>
<li>Client GUIs: Applications that control local or remote BOINC clients.</li>
<li>Credit statistics web sites: Web sites showing credit information (project totals, user/team/country leaderboards) based on daily XML feeds of statistics data from BOINC projects.

The leading focus is on fighting SARS-CoV-2 and all the new viruses in the future, by joining research workers around the world for understanding better the 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV), to accelerate the open science effort to develop new life-saving therapies.It’s giving us the possibility for simulating protein dynamics, how the coronavirus proteins work, and how to develop therapeutics to stop them or treat.Our project partly derives from the idea that guided the creators of the long-running project SETI@home, which is unfortunately ending the volunteer program this month. It uses distributed computing to analyze radio telescope data in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. Clearly graphics cards are mainly intended for video editing, gaming and even mining of cryptocurrency. But not everyone knows that they can “donate” their AMD Radeon or Nvidia GPU’s spare compute cycles to analyze and possibly help to fight against the ongoing coronavirus pandemic?Software that we develop uses the spare CPU and GPU cycles of thousands of game consoles, smartphones and computers, globally to simulate computational antidote design and protein folding.Viruses include proteins that they use to repress human immune systems and multiply themselves. To follow coronavirus behavior, we want to comprehend how these viral proteins work and how we can invent therapeutics to cure it and eventually stop them.Corona@home can make use of computer simulations to recognize a protein’s moving parts. After that, scientists have a firm grasp on how the atoms move and cooperate within a protein, they can proceed much more closer to explore therapeutics to treat it.Simulations like that, demand massive computational power. And our project Corona@home can carry out compute power as possible at fighting SARS-CoV-2.Because of this networked supercomputer, research workers can project proteins at the level of individual atoms in a fraction of the time, it might take even one powerful computer. Many important biological processes that proteins perform take place over milliseconds to a few seconds. A lot of important biological processes that proteins carry out take places over milliseconds to a few seconds.That might seem short, but measuring atoms as they bounce off one another depends upon time scales in femtoseconds — one quadrillionth of a second.To model just one millisecond of folding, even average-size protein, on a top-of-the-line PC, it can take like 500 years, but thanks to the possibility of Corona@home, we can split these problems into many individual parts. At the same time we can send them for example to 1,000 people at the same time . Running those calculations in parallel, we can take these problems that would have taken 500 years and instead deal with them in months.Corona@home serves could be a starting point for new drug design.At this time, scientists often have only one well-known protein structure to analyze. For example, Beta lactamase is a protein that some bacteria deploy to conserve themselves from antibiotics like penicillin. The protein has a long-studied and well-documented structure. But this structure is only about a single snapshot of beta lactamase at one moment in time.That snapshot contains valuable information, but it’s kind of like seeing a picture of a construction vehicle in a parking lot and trying to guess what it does. Really, what you would like is to watch this thing move around and see how it works together with other machinery to, say, build a building. We’re interested in watching how every atom in a protein moves — as it’s being assembled for the first time and as it goes about its jobs. The atoms in a protein are never still, they’re constantly jostling and moving around. And one genetic mutation changes maybe a dozen atoms out of thousands. We want to understand what that does to the entire protein.For example examining the movement of beta lactamase, already has revealed “cryptic pockets,” Achilles heel in the protein that could be targeted by drugs but that are not visible in the long-studied snapshot of this protein. The cryptic pockets only reveal themselves when the protein is moving. Corona@home provide scientists a look at long-studied proteins, revealing solutions to biological problems that might be not seen in the first placeAs part of the client–server model network architecture, the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project’s database servers, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers will track their contributions on the Corona@home website, which makes volunteers’ participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.Laboratories around the world are generating in an unprecedented manner, more and more genome sequences and related clinical and epidemiological data associated with the newly emerging coronavirus (hCoV-19) rapidly made available via GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org), which enabled researchers to rapidly develop tests for this novel pathogen. Other labs have shared experimentally-determined and computationally-predicted structures of some of the viral proteins, and still others have shared epidemiological data. We can benefit from improved protein structure prediction using potentials from deep learning as a part of machine learning.Figure SARS-COV-2 membrane protein: a rendering of one of protein structure predictionsTo help us run scientific simulations is the primary way to contribute. These calculations are enormous and every little bit helps! Each simulation you run is like buying a lottery ticket. The more tickets we buy, the better our chances of hitting the jackpot. Usually, your computer or server will never be idle. There is a lot of valuable science to be done, and we’re getting it running as quickly as we can.Source: Corona@home’s team.

CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIA – HOW YOU CAN HELP?
You can simulate the dynamics of COVID-19 proteins to hunt for new therapeutic opportunities2019-nCoV behaves in a similar way and it is very similar to SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). For both coronaviruses, mostly the first step of infection takes place in the lungs, when a protein on the area of the virus binds  to a receptor protein on a lung cell. The name of this viral protein is spike protein, present in red on the image below, and the receptor is known as ACE2. There is known one kind of protein – therapeutic antibody, it has the possibility to block the viral protein from binding to its receptor, and also can stop the virus from infecting the lung cell. There is already developed therapeutic antibody for SARS-, but to develop small molecules or  therapeutic antibodies for 2019-nCoV, researchers need to better know the structure of the viral spike protein and how it binds to the human ACE2 receptor required for viral entry into human cells.Proteins are not stagnant—they wiggle and fold and unfold to take on numerous shapes.  We need to study not only one shape of the viral spike protein, but all the ways the protein wiggles and folds into alternative shapes in order to best understand how it interacts with the ACE2 receptor, so that an antibody can be designed. Low-resolution structures of the SARS-CoV spike protein exist and we know the mutations that differ between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV.  Given this information, we are uniquely positioned to help model the structure of the 2019-nCoV spike protein and identify sites that can be targeted by a therapeutic antibody. We can build computational models that accomplish this goal, but it takes a lot of computing power.   This is where you can contribute! With many computers working towards the same goal, we aim to help develop a therapeutic remedy as quickly as possible. Being part of Corona@Home, you can help provide us with the computational power required to tackle this problem. One protein from 2019-nCoV, a protease encoded by the viral RNA, has already been crystallized. Although the 2019-nCoV spike protein of interest has not yet been resolved bound to ACE2, our objective is to use the homologous structure of the SARS-CoV spike protein to identify therapeutic antibody targets.We can benefit from supercomputing power, scientific software framework and improved protein structure prediction using potentials from deep learning as a part of machine learning (see the section: DEEP LEARNING – IMPROVE PROTEIN STRUCTURE PREDICTION).COVID-19 research currently in developmentCorona@home is in contact with medical research organizations to provide them computing and deep learning power, to expedite the discovery and rollout of tests, treatments and cures.According to The Milken Institute, who created aggregation of publicly available information from validated sources, we track a comprehensive online tracker (https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf)  that looks at all of the COVID-19 research currently in development. Each row tracks a treatment or vaccine from discovery to clinical trial, accompanied by the name of the organization undertaking the research. This tool, collated from publicly available sources, will be updated regularly and we’ll contact listed institutions with a proposal of cooperation.This illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reveals ultrastructural morphology exhibited by coronaviruses. Note the spikes that adorn the outer surface of the virus, which impart the look of a corona surrounding the virion, when viewed electron microscopically.

SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUNDThe essential component for many biological functions is protein. It takes actions in biological functions and participates in virtually all processes within biological cells. Commonly they behave like enzymes, carrying out biochemical reactions including cell signaling, cellular regulation and molecular transportation. Some act as a type of antibodies, others as a skeleton for cells and some proteins participate in the immune system.

First, before protein is allowed to take these roles, it must fold into a functional three-dimensional structure. This process is mostly spontaneous and depends on interaction within its amino acid sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their area.
Its very important to understanding how protein works and behave, and it is recognized as a holy grail of computational biology. Usually when in a crowded cellular environment folding is happening, the process passes smoothly. But, when due to a protein’s chemical characteristic or other factors, proteins can misfold. It means when protein fold down in the wrong way and end up deformed. If cellular mechanisms do not have the ability to refold misfolded proteins or destroy them, then they can aggregate and cause different diseases.
Because of complicatication of proteins conformation and also configuration space, and limits of computing power., stimulation of all-atom molecular dynamics have been very limited in the timescale.
Most proteins before 2010 mostly fold in the order of milliseconds, and simulation could only be done nanosecond to microsecond timescales. Power of supercomputers of usually have been used for simulating protein folding. But this operation was very expensive and mostly only shared among many research groups. Protein folding is not one step process. In some cases folding time of protein is nearly 96%, waiting in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein’s energy landscape.
Folding@home is using conformations of a process known as adaptive sampling, and it is their starting point for a set of simulation trajectories. With every discovery of conformations made by simulations, trajectories are restarted from them and from this process is slowly created the Markov state model (MSM).
The length of the proteins that has studied Folding@home during 2000 and 2010 have increased by a factor of four, while its timescale of protein folding have increased by six orders of magnitude. Folding@home in 2002 started to use Markov state models to gather approximately a million CPU days of simulation over the span of a few months.
MSMs correlated another simulation in 2011 that required an aggregate of 10 million CPU hours of computing. Folding@home used MSMs in January 2010, to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-residue NTL9 protein out to 1.52 milliseconds, it was timescale compatible with experimental folding rate predictions. But it was a thousand times longer than achieved in the first place. Model was built with individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, this was providing an unparalleled level of many details into the protein’s energy area.

WHAT IS PROTEIN FOLDING
Protein folding it is a physical process consisting of formation by a polypeptide (it owns a structure of random coil) highly organized structure with a characteristic and stable conformation.Each protein is assumed to be in the form of an unstructured polypeptide chain shortly after translation. Such a polypeptide does not show the presence of a well-defined, stable spatial structure. It is only due to the interaction between adjacent amino acids that the polypeptide begins to adopt a specific conformation, often referred to as the “native” state. It is currently believed that the main factor determining the native structure of a given protein is its amino acid sequence, however, some observations indicate that the natural structure of proteins found in a living cell may be dependent on interactions with other proteins or nucleic acids. 
Protein folding (schematic image). The macromolecular shape is changing from a chain-like structure (left) to the compact, characteristic native protein structure (right) while crossing complicated intermediate shapes. (Source: Article Structurally Resolved Coarse-Grained Modeling of Motor Protein Dynamics, Holger fleshsig; https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293317366_Structurally_Resolved_Coarse-Grained_Modeling_of_Motor_Protein_Dynamics) For most known proteins, the correct spatial structure is necessary for their physiological role. Failure to adopt the expected structure usually leads to the formation of a protein with different properties that can even be toxic to the body (an example can be many prion proteins). Much evidence suggests that certain neurodegenerative diseases are caused by the accumulation of proteins with abnormal structures such as amyloids that form long fibers in the cells.

EXAMPLES OF APPLICATION IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH
Protein misfolding can cause different diseases, for example Huntington’s disease, sickle-cell anemia, cancer, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, Alzheimer’s disease and also type II diabetes. Virus HIV and also Influenza cause cellular infection are implay folding events on cell membranes. Understanding better protein misfolding, treatments can compound  that boost cells native ability to control protein folding. 
   
(Alzheimer’s disease is connected with  the aggregation of amyloid beta protein fragments in the brain (right). Researchers at the Folding@home used it to simulate this aggregation process, to better understand the cause of the disease.)  Such therapies include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, and help to destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process. The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the rational design of therapeutics. such as expediting and lowering the costs of drug discovery. For example, the first five years of work at Folding@home  was focused on progression in understanding folding, when now the goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer’s.  The simulations created by Folding@home are used in connection with experiments in the laboratory, but research workers   can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. Studying aspects of misfolding, folding and also correlations with diseases is really advantageous. For example, in 2011 Folding@home lead simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal exit which occurred to help researchers understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.   Typically, scientists use a chemical compound – denatured alcoholin research to unfold proteins from their stable native state, but in general there  is no knowledge how it can affect the protein refolding. Folding@home in 2010 used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of Protein L, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.  Non-profit unit – The Pande Lab which is part of Stanford University. Results of big data from projects are available for free. It can be used by other researchers upon request and also some of it can be obtained from Folding@home.  The collaborations between Blue Gene supercomputer, and Pande Lab and they ahre Folding@home key software with different research workers and various science centers. Thanks to that, algorithms which were useful for Folding@home, can be fruitful in other scientific areas.   The open-source Copernicus software, which they released in 2011 is based on Folding@home’s MSM and other parallelizing techniques and its target is to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large computer clusters or supercomputers. All summaries of every scientific discovery from Folding@home are available on Folding@home website.

HIDDEN MARKOV MODEL
 
Corona@home uses Markov state models, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable random coil state and finishes in its native state conformation.  DEEP LEARNING – improve protein structure predictionmachine learning, artificial intelligence to improve protein structure prediction associated with COVID-19 Predicting the protein structure can be used to make a three-dimensional shape of a protein which is based on its amino acid sequence. This is the biggest dilmate for researchers, because the structure of protein in a big group regulate its function, but still structures of protein can be very hard to set experimentally. The last major progression of these studies has been achieved through the use of genetic information. We can predict which of the amino  acid remains are in interconnection. This can be reached by analyzing covariance in homologous sequences, which helps in predicting given protein structures.It gave us the chance to teach a neural network. Thanks to that, we have the ability to make accurate good forecasting of the distances between pairs of residues. This date includes much more information about structure than contact predictions. Applying this information, we have the ability to formulate a potential of power that can precisely portray the shape of a protein. This potential  we can form by a simple gradient descent algorithm to bring out structures without complex sampling procedures. By uncovering the prognosis of the structure of several poorly studied proteins related with  SARs-Cov_2- the virus that causes COVID-19, we can contribute to the development of science associated with this. We point, that these projections have not been scientifically confirmed. But we hope that they may do something for science associated with viruses functions and help with making hypothesis generation platform for future experimental work in developing therapeutics. For half a century  research workers had the ability to specify patterns of proteins in laboratories using magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron microscopy and also nuclear magnetic resonance. But error and trials  appear in each of these methods, and costs tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per each protein structure and also it can take many years of research. That is why AI methods are chosen by biologists as a shorter path for  process for difficult proteins. They have two options. In the first they work on genetic code and thanks to this can predict the shape of the protein – faster and more reliable method. The second option available is to determine the protein with the help of long and costly experiments.How can AI make a difference?Thanks to rapid reduction in the cost of genetic sequencing the field of genomics is much more rich in data.The effect shows in deep  learning and it approaches the prediction problem that rely on genomic data have become increasingly successful in the last years. Biennial global competition called the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) was established in 1994. The CASP has been created to accumulate measure and research progress on the newest methods to accomplish better accuracy of predictions . In the center of interest for  AI teams is mainly the problem of modeling target shapes from zero, and without using previously solved proteins as patterns. AI teams  gained a high degree of precision, during predicting the physical properties of a protein structure, and then used two separate methods to create predictions of full protein structures. Using neural networks to predict physical propertiesDeep neural networks that are trained to predict properties of the protein form its genetic sequence – these two methods are based on this. The properties networks predict are: (a) the distances between pairs of amino acids and (b) the angles between chemical bonds that connect those amino acids. The first development is a progression of generally used techniques that estimate whether pairs of amino acids are near each other. A skilled neural network can predict a distribution of distances between every pair of residues in a protein (visualised in Figure 2). These probabilities were then combined into a score that estimates how accurate a proposed protein structure is. We can also train a single neural network that uses all distances in aggregate to estimate how close the proposed structure is to the right answer.FIGURE 2: Two ways of visualising the accuracy of prediction. The top figure features the distance matrices for three proteins. The brightness of each pixel represents the distance between the amino acids in the sequence comprising the protein – the brighter pixel, the closer the pair. Shown in the top row are the real, experimentally determined distances and, in the bottom row, the average predicted distances distributions. Importantly, these match well on both global and local scales. The bottom panels represent the same comparison using 3d models, featuring predictions (blue) versus ground-truth data (green) for the same three proteins. Because of the ability to use  these scoring functions, we can look for protein shape  and try to find structures that match our predictions. In the first method, which  is built on techniques usually used in structural biology, and repeatedly substituted parts of a protein structure with new protein fragments. Trained a generative neural network to invent novel  parts, which are used to incessantly develop the score of the proposed protein structure.FIGURE 3: A schematic of the architecture of the ALPHAFOLD system predicting structure from protein sequence.  The second method optimised scores through gradient descent—a mathematical technique mostly  used in machine learning for making small, incremental improvements—which appear in highly precise structures. This technique was applied to entire protein chains rather than to pieces that must be folded separately before being built up into a bigger structure, to simplify the prediction process.We are amazed  by the prosperity of the protein folding model, but still there is a lot of work before us in the realm of protein biology. We really want to find a way to establishing methods that AI can cooperate to fundamental scientific discovery.Because of that kind of thinking, it will lead us in the end to improve understanding about how it works and will be helpful for scientists to target and construct new, effective treatments for diseases in an improved way. Scientists have only mapped structures for about half of all the proteins made by human cells. There are a lot of rare diseases with mutation in a single gene, and this results in a malformed protein which can have  intense outcome on the health of an entire organism. This method probably has the ability to help us and reachers workers to find efficient drug discovery, and during this reducing the costs associated with experimentation. In our hearts, we hope that thanks to using AI for disease research could be useful and helpful to improve quality of life for millions of patients all over the globe. But advantages from it are not only restricted for health issues. Great knowledge about protein folding can also be of some use for instance  in advances in biodegradable enzymes – this can be done by protein design. This research could help us manage pollutants like oil and plastic, and support us in breaking down waste in ways that are more friendly to our earth. Some scientists have already begun engineering bacteria to single proteins that will make waste biodegradable and much more easier to process. Machine learning systems can integrate various sources of information about protein folding  – this significant data can help scientists come up with solutions to complex problems in a faster way. As we know how AI can help people master complex games through systems like AlphaGo and AlphaZero, We think AI breakthroughs will help serve as a platform to advance our knowledge of essential, scientific dilemmas in a much quicker way. It is very interesting and exciting to be witness  to these signs of progress in protein folding, improving the utility of AI for scientific discovery. There is still numerous work and a lot of  research to do before we are able to have a significant effect on treating diseases, managing waste, and more and more… and we know the potential of it is  tremendous.

Corona@home’s DEV and system architecture
 
Corona@home system involves five components: work units, core, server/grid of the masternodes, client/wallet and tools (client for mobile phones and nextgen video game consoles from Sony and Microsoft planned in the future)Work unitsA work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and fully processed by a users computer, it is returned to Corona@home servers, which then award the user with  credit points and this cycle is automatic. All work units have linked deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this gives  the overall simulation process to proceed in a normal way if a work unit is not returned after a sensible period of time. Because of these deadlines  the minimum system demand for Corona@home is a Pentium 3 450 MHz CPU with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). Major advantage of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly competing simulations that’s why work units for high-performance clients have a  much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client.Before public release, work units go through several quality assurance steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Corona@home. Work units from Corona@home’s are typically processed only once, except in the uncommon event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.The Corona@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.CoreThe calculations on the work unit are made by specialized molecular dynamics programs as a background process.  Major amount of Corona@home’s cores are lean on GROMACS(GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations). It is one of the powerful and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which mostly rely on manually optimized assembly language code and hardware optimizations.To enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update the core is separated from the clienti. When work of cores is interrupted can resume work from  point upon startup that is why cores periodically create calculation checkpoints. GROMACS is a comprehensive package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles.It is  mostly designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is very fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.GROMACS assists  all the standard algorithms you expect from modern molecular dynamics implementation.  In the code a lot of algorithmic optimizations have been introduced. For example, extract the calculation of the virial from the innermost loops over pairwise interactions, and they use their own software routines to calculate the inverse square root.In GROMACS 4.6 and up, on almost all common computing platforms, the innermost loops are written in C using inner  functions that the compiler transforms to SIMD machine instructions, to utilize the accessible instruction-level parallelism. These kernels are available in  single and also double precision, and assist all the different kinds of SIMD support found in x86-family processors.http://www.gromacs.orgClient/WalletUsers of Corona@home install a client/wallet program on their  personal computer (mobile devices and next gen game consoles – future roadmap). Participant collaborate with the client, which manages other software or masternodes components in the background.Throughout the client/wallet, the user may stop and pause the folding process, open an event log, and check work development  or also view personal statistics. Computers of clients run uninterruptedly in the background at a low priority, by using idle processing power and because of that clients computer normal work is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings.The client connects to a Corona@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client’s settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Corona@home servers. Computer clients are conformable to uniprocessors and multi-core processor systems, and also graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Corona@home with the ability to successfully complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.Professional software developers are responsible for Corona@home’s code, both for the client and server-side.  While the client’s graphical user interface (GUI) is open-source, the client is proprietary software citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons. CLIENT/WALLET FOR MOBILE PHONES ( ROADMAP Q3 2020)1. Monitor the progress and status of your folding slots while not being near your systems. It will also enable you to change settings of the configuration of your folding systems or visualize proteins in 3D on your computer or servers which they work on.2. Due to the progressively increasing performance of top smartphones (e.g based on Snapdragon 865 with Adreno 650 GPU or Apple A13 Bionic with A13 Bionic’s GPU), we plan to include Android and iOS apps and implement mobile devices in the Corona@home’s distributed computing ecosystem.SERVER / MASTERNODEMasternodes serve as the integrity of Corona@home’s blockchain ecosystem, stakeable CORO passive income and a grid of distributed supercomputers to simulate and predict the dynamics of proteins.For volunteering and network grid using API, an open-source middleware system  is anticipated – Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC).At first it was used to support the SETI@home, but this platform became resultful in a novel and inventive way for other applications in  various fields of science like mathematics, medicine, molecular biology, climatology, astrophysics, linguistics. The target of BOINC is to provide researchers to step into the enormous processing resources of multiple personal computers around the world.Scientific computations are run on users’ computers. After sending the user from the client to the scientific researchers database, the backend server checks and analyzes the results. The validation process engage  running all tasks on computers with multiple collaborators and comparing results.  BOINC provides APIs for various types of applications and web sites that interact with BOINC components:
Client GUIs: Applications that control local or remote BOINC clients.
Credit statistics web sites: Web sites showing credit information (project totals, user/team/country leaderboards) based on daily XML feeds of statistics data from BOINC projects. The XML format is documented here.
Account managers: Web sites that let BOINC users create and manage accounts on multiple projects.
Aggregate credit statistics: Web RPCs for getting cross-project credit data for hosts, teams and users.
Web RPCs: These interfaces let a program or web site obtain information about projects, and create/edit entities (users, teams, hosts) on projects.
Local editing of preferences: This mechanism lets you write programs for local editing of preferences.
APIs for remote job submission, management of input files, and fetching output files.

Germs are everywhere... especially on doorknobs and levers.
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends regular disinfection of doorknobs and levers in residences, schools, office spaces, hospitals, nursing homes, cruise ships, and more to help mitigate the spread of germs.

Citrus provides a solution to a problem that is ubiquitous in today’s world.

  Citrus is easy to install! No tools required.   HOW IT WORKS
Citrus detects movement of the door
Citrus enters into a delay of 10 seconds
Citrus activates the UV-C Lights for 60 seconds
After sanitization process is complete Citrus enters into standby mode ready for the next time the door is used
 

 
Today, UV-C light is used in countless applications in order to purify the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the surfaces we touch. UV-C light is an increasingly prevalent and efficient sanitation method.  Currently available in three different door knob finishes.   Citrus disinfects doorknob surfaces by emitting ultraviolet light at the “germicidal” wavelength of 270-285nm. This wavelength is within the ultraviolet-C band (UV-C) which has been scientifically proven to kill or inactivate microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc.) by destroying their nucleic acids and disrupting their DNA.  In 2017, Citrus was just an idea casually tossed around at the gym. Since that initial discussion, Citrus has evolved into a fully functioning tested prototype, and now ready to be used in homes.Efficacy tests for the first revision of Citrus’ were conducted in 2018 at the Center for Innovative Ventures of Emerging Technologies Department of Biomedical Engineering Rutgers Medical Device Development Center using a 12mW LED UV-C light. Three common pathogens were tested: Escherichia coli (E.coli), Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (PA), and Staphylococcus Aureus (SA). Timing intervals used were 15 seconds.The reduction of pathogens using UV-C lights are a result of three main factors: Radiant Flux (power of the UV-C light), distance, and time. Ee=Φe/(4πd^2 ) Citrus’ first revision test results surpassed theoretically calculated reduction values showing a 99% reduction of E. Coli in 15 seconds, Staph. Aureus in 45 seconds, and Pseudomonas Aeruginosa in 90 seconds. Since then Citrus has incorporated a stronger LED UV-C, 19mW (58% stronger) and is mounted closer to the doorknob (1.5 inches at the furthest point vs. 2.5 inches in the first revision).These changes have made this current version of Citrus 439% more effective, in other words, 4.39 times quicker at killing pathogens than the first version tested at the Center for Innovative Ventures of Emerging Technologies. SUSTAINABILITY From how we operate within our company to how we partner with our customers and communities, sustainability is a key value of our business. Currently, Citrus' packaging is 100% recyclable material and the LED UVC lights last, on average, 10,000 hours. For a household of four that will last longer than 5 years.We see tremendous opportunity, in the near future, to expand the use of reusable/rechargeable batteries, recyclable and recycled materials for packaging, and various other product elements to meet today's environmental best practice standards.As we look to the future, we are committed to causing no unnecessary harm and using our business to inspire environmental stewardship and healthy/safe solutions to drive our community forward. Keep Up with Citrus on Social Media Hit the buttons below to stay updated on our journey and to share our page with a friend or family member who you know would love Citrus.",22.0,2,"2 Campaigns

</h3><h3>Working UV-C technology</h3><p><i>We usually do not like to offend other projects or products, but when it comes to health and safety issues, we believe a bit of open information is necessary to protect people from false promises.</i></p><p>A UV-C LED will by no means achieve anything to help to sterilize air in a facemask. In short: The strongest UV-C LED on the market at a wholesale cost of 52 USD emits only 48 mw of UVC light. Typical projects use either one or 2 but usually weaker ones. It would need about 100 seconds to sterilize about 1 litre of air, the amount you breathe in and out with each breathing cycle. So UV-C LED simply will not work and will not do anything to the incoming or outgoing air at all since it is just not strong enough to perform the sterilization of the amount of air you in- and exhale.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://j.gifs.com/yogMBz.gif"" src=""""/> </p><p><strong>LuminoGo uses a Philips fluorescent UV-C light with our own developed electronics and it emits 1100 mW of UV-C light, around 100x as much power as the typical UV-C LED. The light cost around 9USD and you can replace it yourself.</strong></p><p><br/><i><strong>However, we recommend to use the UV-C module, if only, for the sterilization of the exhaled air. Use of UV-C light for the sterilization of air is well researched and many applications are in place, BUT to this day there is no facemask using this technology that has approval as a medical device. We provide the Lumino UV-C module for you to experiment and to help us to push this technology forward. </strong></i></p><p><i>If you wish to inform yourself about the use of UV-C light for sterilization we recommend to visit the <strong><a href=""https://iuva.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">International Ultraviolet Association</a></strong></i></p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596472160/hzivx8ayfetnidvtkiy0.png"" src=""""/></h3><h3>Filtration of in-and exhaled air</h3><p>Since it is not only important to protect yourself through the filtration of the inhaled air through approved FFP3 3M filters, as well others should be protected through the filtration of your exhaled air. That is why LuminoGO has the option to filter the exhaled air in various ways, through FFP3 3M filters or through the UV-C module. You have as well the option to not filter the exhaled air at all. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596545842/nmw0sxnqqxahu7ijfvmd.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3><strong>So many masks on Indiegogo!</strong></h3><p><i>When you have a transparent mask that you do not want to fog up, there is only one solution to for this: use a really strong fan, which can create pressure. The transparent masks on Indiegogo, if they use a fan at all, use an axial fan, this one does not create pressure, meaning it is so weak that it does not prevent the mask from fogging up from the inside. A human can emit up to 70ml of water through his breath in 1 hour. If you do not have a very strong fan the mask will instantly fog up. This  can as well be seen in a few videos which are supposed to show how the mask work.<br/><br/>LuminoGO uses a 5 Watt radial fan, which is a really strong fan, able to create pressure to always deliver enough fresh air so the mask will stay transparent. As well, the pressure is important since it creates a constant excess pressure, therefore leaks are less dangerous since the excess pressure will prevent air entering from those leaks.<br/><br/>By the way, do not wear a mask over a beard since this would mean a lot of leaks and air leaking.</i></p><p><i>We do not promise, like a lot of other projects, features, like CO2 sensors, which alone cost around 140$ <strong>(<a href=""https://www.co2meter.com/products/sprintir-100-percent-co2-sensor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here is the link for one)</a></strong> or microbatteries that can magically last for up to 10 hours.</i></p><p><i>As well, the claim of many projects to sterilize the air with UV-C light is absurd, since they are only using UV-C LEDs, which are very expensive, one with 10-18 mW radiant flux of UV-C light costs around 50$. Since around 200 mW of radiant flux are needed to sterilize the air, only the UV-C LED’s would cost around 800$ to 1000$.</i></p><p><i>The LuminoGo has an optional UV-C module, but this does not work with LED’s due to them being this expensive, but with a UV-C fluorescent light from Philipps, which doesn’t emit ozon, and only costs about 9$, with a UV-C radiant flux of 1100Watt, not 10-18mW like the LED’s.

<li>It eliminates the effort to breathe through a filter, which causes severe headaches after 2-3 hours.</li>
<li>It always provides fresh air, you will never breathe your own exhaled air again wearing the mask.</li>
<li>Your whole face is always visible which improves communication substantially, especially for people with a hearing problem.  </li>
<li>You have great acoustics; you can be heard as if you don’t wear a mask (LuminoGO’s patented technology)</li>
<li>It is reusable, dramatic reduction of produced waste!! The UV.C version will have no wearing parts.</li>
<li>Costs are low since you can reuse it, over a year of use it is almost 90% cheaper than a regular mask.</li>
</ul><p><strong>LuminoGO improves your experience when wearing a mask significantly, you can be seen and heard much better, you can work longer hours and stay concentrated much longer.</strong></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Cleaning of LuminoGO</strong></h3><p>The material which is used for the 3D-print of the LuminoGO can be sterilized with common methods such as using an<strong> autoclave, steam, heat, UV-Cor vapor of sterilization liquids.</strong> The autoclave and steam options can over time harm the ventilator. To avoid this close the opening to the filter.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>The current LuminoGO model is provided with industry standard FFP3 filters by 3M, most of the advantages of the mask can be used and enjoyed this way. Our goal however is to have the first certified UV-C mask on the market, therefore Lumino needs to undergo a series of certifications and testing. <strong>The UV-C modules are therefore only provided for testing and we cannot claim the effectiveness or safety of the UV-C module. The use of the UV-C module happens at one’s own risk.</strong></p><p>After this campaign this will be the main focus of the company, anyone that takes part in this campaign will be kept informed about the progress and will have an opportunity to purchase these modules as well new modules also later on at an exceptional price.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p>LuminoGO is not only a tech gadget or design item, it was created to actually help people during this difficult time.</p><p><strong>Older patients often have troubles understanding people wearing regular masks, people who are hard of hearing also need to see the face to be able to communicate.</strong></p><p>In many situations being surrounded by people all wearing masks can be scary, recognizing und reading the expression of the faces is important and allows to stay calm.  </p><p>Working long hours with masks is tiering, first because of the effort to breath in air through a regular mask, second because of rebreathing the own air. Both cause headaches extremely fast.</p><p>LuminoGO solves these important problems, if you know an organisation or people that need our improved masks, please let us know, and share our project.</p><p><br/><strong>We are giving away masks for free to institutions who do need help in this matter such as the hard of hearing.</strong></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Shipping</strong></h3><p><i>We charge a flat fee of 19$ for the shipping.

If you wish to inform yourself about the use of UV-C light for sterilization we recommend to visit the International Ultraviolet Association Filtration of in-and exhaled airSince it is not only important to protect yourself through the filtration of the inhaled air through approved FFP3 3M filters, as well others should be protected through the filtration of your exhaled air. That is why LuminoGO has the option to filter the exhaled air in various ways, through FFP3 3M filters or through the UV-C module. You have as well the option to not filter the exhaled air at all.    So many masks on Indiegogo!When you have a transparent mask that you do not want to fog up, there is only one solution to for this: use a really strong fan, which can create pressure. The transparent masks on Indiegogo, if they use a fan at all, use an axial fan, this one does not create pressure, meaning it is so weak that it does not prevent the mask from fogging up from the inside. A human can emit up to 70ml of water through his breath in 1 hour. If you do not have a very strong fan the mask will instantly fog up. This  can as well be seen in a few videos which are supposed to show how the mask work.LuminoGO uses a 5 Watt radial fan, which is a really strong fan, able to create pressure to always deliver enough fresh air so the mask will stay transparent. As well, the pressure is important since it creates a constant excess pressure, therefore leaks are less dangerous since the excess pressure will prevent air entering from those leaks.By the way, do not wear a mask over a beard since this would mean a lot of leaks and air leaking.We do not promise, like a lot of other projects, features, like CO2 sensors, which alone cost around 140$ (here is the link for one) or microbatteries that can magically last for up to 10 hours.As well, the claim of many projects to sterilize the air with UV-C light is absurd, since they are only using UV-C LEDs, which are very expensive, one with 10-18 mW radiant flux of UV-C light costs around 50$. Since around 200 mW of radiant flux are needed to sterilize the air, only the UV-C LED’s would cost around 800$ to 1000$.The LuminoGo has an optional UV-C module, but this does not work with LED’s due to them being this expensive, but with a UV-C fluorescent light from Philipps, which doesn’t emit ozon, and only costs about 9$, with a UV-C radiant flux of 1100Watt, not 10-18mW like the LED’s. (Here is the link for our UV-C lamp at Philips)  LuminoGO versions  The LuminoGO StoryWe are a team of engineers and industrial designers passionate about design and functionality, we usually work for large corporations and develop industrial machinery, this our first personal project directly for you and your safety. Our team is based in Vancouver, Canada, and Vienna, Austria.We have investigated the masks on the market and concluded that there seem to exist so many possibilities to improve the current designs. Consequently our aim was to create the perfect mask, a mask that helps to see the person wearing it, to be able to talk, to constantly have fresh air for breathing and to eliminate the need for disposable filters in order to reduce waste.Since the LuminoGO mask is an existing mask, we want to bring this comfortable mask to as many people around the globe as possible, especially to support those who have to work long hours wearing a mask and need to travel. Our transparent mask is expacially important when communicating with the hard of hearing, eldery and children. We have come a long way already, starting with various prototyps, our second one can be seen below in the gif. What We Need & What You GetThe mask can be already produced right now, but 3D printing and custom electronics are expensive at low volume, the aim of this campaign is to mass produce the product and to source better customized parts at a better price for everyone. Therefor the funding goal is set to 10.000$ since this way we will get a better deals for all the components of the mask.Please note that every version of the mask comes with a eye shield! LuminoGO - Filter: the version with 2x FFP3 3M filters and a strong fan for the freshest possible experience under a mask.LuminoGO - UV-C Module: the package that has it all, 2x FFP3 filters, a fan as well as the future of filters, the UV-C light module for you to test and experiment. Please note that we do not advice to use the UV-C module for inhalation and we want to make sure that this experimental set is aimed at those who wish to experiment, this is not a proven product.The LuminoGO mask has a price that resembles the quality -  a long-lasting mask that will support you during travel, long working hours and in everyday life.The price will enable all the features we are presenting to you to actually work! We are, unlike other projects, transparent about the products we use and what the mask can and can not do! 
As it can be seen on the picture below every mask comes with an eyeshield: The exact name of the FFP3 3M filters we used and that come with the mask (2x): 3M 2135 P3R. You will be able to easily buy them online once you need new ones. Please note that you can use every filter with a round bayonet.  Sealing of LuminoGO: soft silicone foam is used for the inside of the mask, it is about 7mm thick, very confortable through its softness and does not leave air pass. SizesLuminoGO comes in 3 different sizes, so all your family members can be equipped with a LuminoGO mask. You can choose between these after placing your order:*Small                                                  *Medium                                            *Large (for youngsters from 14 to 18) On the picture below you can see how to measure your head size:                                                                  Colours If you wish you can choose a colour for your LuminoGO when ordering your Corporate Set with 5 complete LuminoGO Filter masks. Match the colour with your corporate identity! The ImpactLuminoGO is not only a new type of mask, it solves several real-world problems:
It eliminates the effort to breathe through a filter, which causes severe headaches after 2-3 hours.
It always provides fresh air, you will never breathe your own exhaled air again wearing the mask.
Your whole face is always visible which improves communication substantially, especially for people with a hearing problem.  
You have great acoustics; you can be heard as if you don’t wear a mask (LuminoGO’s patented technology)
It is reusable, dramatic reduction of produced waste!! The UV.C version will have no wearing parts.
Costs are low since you can reuse it, over a year of use it is almost 90% cheaper than a regular mask.
LuminoGO improves your experience when wearing a mask significantly, you can be seen and heard much better, you can work longer hours and stay concentrated much longer. Cleaning of LuminoGOThe material which is used for the 3D-print of the LuminoGO can be sterilized with common methods such as using an autoclave, steam, heat, UV-Cor vapor of sterilization liquids. The autoclave and steam options can over time harm the ventilator. To avoid this close the opening to the filter. Risks & ChallengesThe current LuminoGO model is provided with industry standard FFP3 filters by 3M, most of the advantages of the mask can be used and enjoyed this way. Our goal however is to have the first certified UV-C mask on the market, therefore Lumino needs to undergo a series of certifications and testing. The UV-C modules are therefore only provided for testing and we cannot claim the effectiveness or safety of the UV-C module. The use of the UV-C module happens at one’s own risk.After this campaign this will be the main focus of the company, anyone that takes part in this campaign will be kept informed about the progress and will have an opportunity to purchase these modules as well new modules also later on at an exceptional price. Other Ways You Can HelpLuminoGO is not only a tech gadget or design item, it was created to actually help people during this difficult time.Older patients often have troubles understanding people wearing regular masks, people who are hard of hearing also need to see the face to be able to communicate.In many situations being surrounded by people all wearing masks can be scary, recognizing und reading the expression of the faces is important and allows to stay calm.  Working long hours with masks is tiering, first because of the effort to breath in air through a regular mask, second because of rebreathing the own air. Both cause headaches extremely fast.LuminoGO solves these important problems, if you know an organisation or people that need our improved masks, please let us know, and share our project.We are giving away masks for free to institutions who do need help in this matter such as the hard of hearing. ShippingWe charge a flat fee of 19$ for the shipping. Since we operate from Canada and Austria, we will print and ship masks ordered from Canada, the US and Australia in the US, meaning the shipping time will be fast. If you order from Europe, Asia or Africa, your mask will be shipped from Austria.  The Team",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>          I am a 25 year old entrepreneur from the Republic of Moldova, passionate about helping people, as much as I can. This is what spiked my interest for international healthcare and the medical tourism industry altogether. How I came about this particular interest, you might wonder? Last year, while doing an internship in Sri Lanka, I had to undergo an I&amp;D surgery under general anaesthesia because of a large abscess on my leg. I was all by myself in a foreign country, barely understanding my surgeon's English which, to be honest, made me quite uncomfortable. This is how the idea of Health Outsourced was born. For the past 10 months, my team and I have been trying to make a change for the better regarding situations similar to mine. We’re on a quest of making the world a better place, by making sure that people going abroad for treatment or surgery will have the best international patient experience possible. And every each one of you can help us do so.</p> <p>We truly believe everyone should have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare solutions and that is why we have chosen to be active in the medical tourism industry. However, a proper online awareness campaign and a useful, user centered website are crucial to the success of our plan. And this is where you come in. This is how you can help Health Outsourced make a difference for the enormous amount of people with low income or without health insurance. We will aid them in finding healthcare solution outside their own country that will meet their budget, without compromising the quality of the medical services.</p>

<p>Most medical tourism agencies have professional, multi-functional websites, that enable the patients to navigate through all the necessary information on the various hospitals available, to check and compare prices and even schedule consultations. But these medical agencies charge patients starting with basic assistance and care plans.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469549153/x6cn8omzpyypq9zp3cnx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We want to offer our patients the same level of expertise with the added bonus of free, unlimited support before, during and after their trip. We insist on dedicated personal assistance via phone, email, as well as destination managers who will meet and greet and accompany the patient every step of the way.</p>
<p>Going abroad for medical treatment or surgery can be a very hard decision to make. It's always better to hear a compassionate human voice over the phone, than constantly clicking buttons on a website. That is why Health Outsourced is built around the wish of making such a trip as comfortable and secure as possible for our patients. And that’s what we’re here to do.</p>

<p>The reality we’re all painfully aware of is the following: there are millions of people out there without health insurance and even more without the possibility of covering their medical bills in their own countries. Numbers show over 100 million people falling into poverty because of health care costs worldwide. More so, 62% of all bankruptcies in the USA are due to medical bills. What we are offering is a way out, a chance to steadily breathe again.</p>
<p><br/>For instance, a heart bypass that you would normally have to pay around $150,000 for in the United States, can be covered with about $27,000 in Mexico, or just $6,000 in India. Cancer treatments are some of the most expensive treatments in the US. Do you have any idea how many people need them? Probably just as many as the ones in need of knee replacements, gastric bypasses - the list is endless. Obamacare left over 29,000,000 people without health insurance. Not to mention the waiting lists in countries like Canada or the UK, where you’d have to wait for months on end for a simple consultation. Together we can change all of this.              </p>

<p>Up until now, all of our investments have gone into our own professional education and the Health Outsourced website. We have spent $1000 to build and promote our website and around $2000 in trainings and certification programs in the field.

<br/> </div></div>","I am a 25 year old entrepreneur from the Republic of Moldova, passionate about helping people, as much as I can. This is what spiked my interest for international healthcare and the medical tourism industry altogether. How I came about this particular interest, you might wonder? Last year, while doing an internship in Sri Lanka, I had to undergo an I&D surgery under general anaesthesia because of a large abscess on my leg. I was all by myself in a foreign country, barely understanding my surgeon's English which, to be honest, made me quite uncomfortable. This is how the idea of Health Outsourced was born. For the past 10 months, my team and I have been trying to make a change for the better regarding situations similar to mine. We’re on a quest of making the world a better place, by making sure that people going abroad for treatment or surgery will have the best international patient experience possible. And every each one of you can help us do so. We truly believe everyone should have access to high-quality, affordable healthcare solutions and that is why we have chosen to be active in the medical tourism industry. However, a proper online awareness campaign and a useful, user centered website are crucial to the success of our plan. And this is where you come in. This is how you can help Health Outsourced make a difference for the enormous amount of people with low income or without health insurance. We will aid them in finding healthcare solution outside their own country that will meet their budget, without compromising the quality of the medical services.
       
         All of us together, we'll not just be selling treatments, we'll be offering a better quality of life for people who never expected that to happen! 
       
Most medical tourism agencies have professional, multi-functional websites, that enable the patients to navigate through all the necessary information on the various hospitals available, to check and compare prices and even schedule consultations. But these medical agencies charge patients starting with basic assistance and care plans.

We want to offer our patients the same level of expertise with the added bonus of free, unlimited support before, during and after their trip. We insist on dedicated personal assistance via phone, email, as well as destination managers who will meet and greet and accompany the patient every step of the way.
Going abroad for medical treatment or surgery can be a very hard decision to make. It's always better to hear a compassionate human voice over the phone, than constantly clicking buttons on a website. That is why Health Outsourced is built around the wish of making such a trip as comfortable and secure as possible for our patients. And that’s what we’re here to do.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><span>Halean is what has become of a vision, which began nearly 3 years ago, to empower individuals with resources to effectively manage their own health and wellbeing. At the time, Jordon was a graduate student in a Doctoral of Physical Therapy program and began to observe some of those closest to him gradually experience various health concerns. Many of these health concerns were easily treatable and preventable, yet were difficult to overcome and manage.</span></p>
<p><span>With a medical background, an interest in technology and a desire to incorporate some of the latest resources available, Jordon began to seek ways to better empower those around him with tool to manage their health to achieve a state of complete well-being. With the recent explosion of technology, information and wearable devices it became apparent that there was no shortage of ways for individuals to ""track"" their habits and routines. There is a tracker for nearly anything. He did realize however, that there was a need for an effective resource, which could be proactive in nature, and that could gradually guide individuals towards their diverse wellness goals in an efficient and effective manner. Many individuals were in need of a resource which would provide unbiased, accurate information and which could provide users with tools to remain accountable to their goals. Thus the initial concept of Halean was born. </span></p>
<p><span>Fast forward 3 years and a vast amount of research, collaboration and development has lead to this early stage wellness platform which has the power to revolutionize your health. Halean has the ability to guide you to a state of improved well-being, if you only let it and embark on this journey with us.</span></p>

Our Story
Halean is what has become of a vision, which began nearly 3 years ago, to empower individuals with resources to effectively manage their own health and wellbeing. At the time, Jordon was a graduate student in a Doctoral of Physical Therapy program and began to observe some of those closest to him gradually experience various health concerns. Many of these health concerns were easily treatable and preventable, yet were difficult to overcome and manage.
With a medical background, an interest in technology and a desire to incorporate some of the latest resources available, Jordon began to seek ways to better empower those around him with tool to manage their health to achieve a state of complete well-being. With the recent explosion of technology, information and wearable devices it became apparent that there was no shortage of ways for individuals to ""track"" their habits and routines. There is a tracker for nearly anything. He did realize however, that there was a need for an effective resource, which could be proactive in nature, and that could gradually guide individuals towards their diverse wellness goals in an efficient and effective manner. Many individuals were in need of a resource which would provide unbiased, accurate information and which could provide users with tools to remain accountable to their goals. Thus the initial concept of Halean was born. 
Fast forward 3 years and a vast amount of research, collaboration and development has lead to this early stage wellness platform which has the power to revolutionize your health. Halean has the ability to guide you to a state of improved well-being, if you only let it and embark on this journey with us.
