<br/>Factoria is trying to enter in the fashion market but being a young brand is not always easy<br/>.<br/>The last collection, fall 2011/12 was presented during the London Fashion week but it could not be possible to produce it without your help. <br/><br/>Do you believe in art and fashion? then you should believe in young designers!<br/><br/>If you become a Factoria Rent Me supporter brand, you´ll join our brand, being part of Factoria fashion and art projects. Your name will be always placed in our website as a sponsor and of course you will have special and interesting discounts in our collections. <br/><br/>Factoria also believes and supports new art talents. We make limited editions in collaboration with emergent artists.<br/><br/>Be a Factoria sponsor and become also a young artists promoter!<br/><br/>We would apreciate so much your help. We would be delighted to share with you our love for art and fashion.<br/><br/><h3>The collection <br/>
</h3>
<br/><p>This limited-edition collection (""I have lived for love, I have lived
 for art"", fall 11/12)  springs from the collaboration with the Italian 
artist Elena Monzo. </p>
<p>Elena Monzo, established artist represented 
internationally by Bonelli Contemporary Gallery, joins the discourse of 
Factoria Rent Me for this new season.  </p>
<p>""Just kids"", the Best Seller by Patti Smith, is the main source of inspiration for this collection.  </p>
<p>The
 book speaks about the love affair between Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti
 Smith, in a time where idealism and the love of art was a way to live 
and feel. A young innocent, pure vision faced with changes of time; 
sexual freedoms, religions and sects, and political disagreements...  </p>
<p>Robert
 is the key to this collection. A young man who has doubts about his 
sexuality, struggling to come to terms with his religion and the 
internal demons which tormented him. Robert finds release through 
artistic expression to become one of the world’s most renowned  
photographers. Mapplethorpe’s now well know crazy necklaces, crucifixes,
 and rabbit paw charms, color the collection for this new season. The 
photographers work can be seen through the collection’s feminine style, 
evoking his idealistic spirit that art can spring from love.  </p>
<p>In 
order to bring across this concept, Elena Monzo has offered two of her 
paintings, creating a clothe-art piece, a statement of femininity, 
freedom, fresh energy in the effort to feel how  art was felt years ago.
  </p>
<p>Once more, Factoria Rent Me meets art,  but this time to talk about love. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Thanks</h3>Thanks so much for help and believe in new talents.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

We would be delighted to share with you our love for art and fashion.The collection 

This limited-edition collection (""I have lived for love, I have lived
 for art"", fall 11/12)  springs from the collaboration with the Italian 
artist Elena Monzo. 
Elena Monzo, established artist represented 
internationally by Bonelli Contemporary Gallery, joins the discourse of 
Factoria Rent Me for this new season.  
""Just kids"", the Best Seller by Patti Smith, is the main source of inspiration for this collection.  
The
 book speaks about the love affair between Robert Mapplethorpe and Patti
 Smith, in a time where idealism and the love of art was a way to live 
and feel. A young innocent, pure vision faced with changes of time; 
sexual freedoms, religions and sects, and political disagreements...  
Robert
 is the key to this collection. A young man who has doubts about his 
sexuality, struggling to come to terms with his religion and the 
internal demons which tormented him. Robert finds release through 
artistic expression to become one of the world’s most renowned  
photographers. Mapplethorpe’s now well know crazy necklaces, crucifixes,
 and rabbit paw charms, color the collection for this new season. The 
photographers work can be seen through the collection’s feminine style, 
evoking his idealistic spirit that art can spring from love.  
In 
order to bring across this concept, Elena Monzo has offered two of her 
paintings, creating a clothe-art piece, a statement of femininity, 
freedom, fresh energy in the effort to feel how  art was felt years ago.
  
Once more, Factoria Rent Me meets art,  but this time to talk about love.

<p align=""justify""><span>Ginkgo is an innovative compact umbrella, re-designed from scratch and made entirely in just one recyclable material. It is stiff and flexible, able to absorb random impacts and windforce without breaking or bending, but also lightweight, colorful and warm to the touch. And 100% recyclable.</span></p>
<p align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/dimENG.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/02%20innovative%20design.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p align=""justify"">The number of Ginkgo components has been considerably reduced, from the traditional 120 pieces to just 20. <br/>The assembling procedure needs no screws or pivots, as all the couplings are obtained by long lasting and reliable snap-fit joints. With few components there is minimal chance of failure, and the design is favorable with production done by injection moulding.</p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/03%20flexible.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p align=""justify""><span>The stretchers are not assembled, but made with a single piece of flexible plastic. The peculiar patented geometry allows them to resist strong winds by elastically flexing and returning into position without bending. The hinges are designed to last for thousands of open-close cycles.</span></p>

<p align=""justify""><span>Polypropylene is found everywhere in everyday life. It has been chosen for Ginkgo as it is among the lightest plastic materials whilst being extremely resistant to mechanical stress and chemical agents. At the same time it ensures flexibility to the stretchers and the joints, strength and rigidity to the pole. And of course it is completely recyclable.</span></p>

<p align=""justify""><span>Ginkgo is made entirely in a single material. All the parts, from the canopy’s fabric to the seams’ thread, from the pole to the closing button, are made from polypropylene. All the fastening elements, such as screws, pivots and especially glue, have been replaced by integrated snap-fit elements. Thanks to these solutions, when Ginkgo finally reaches the end of its useful life you can just toss it in the recycle bin. No need to disassemble the components.</span></p>

<p align=""justify""><span>All Ginkgo components are made by plastic injection moulding, meaning that each part can be coloured as desired, for a virtually infinite variety of possible combinations and customizations. And some cheerful colours under the rain can make a difference.</span></p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/07%20ENVIRONMENTAL%20PROTECTION.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p align=""justify""><span>Umbrellas on the market today are theoretically made of recyclable materials such as metal, plastic and wood. However, they can’t be recycled as they are. They’d need to be disassembled to be properly disposed of, which means that most of them just end up going to landfill...a big waste of resources. The polyester canopy, as an example, takes up to 100 years to biodegrade.<br/><br/></span></p>

<p align=""justify""><em>Umbrellas' impact</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><span>Every year about 1 billion umbrellas are broken, lost, and improperly disposed of.</span></p>
<p align=""justify""><span>With an average length of 75 centimeters, putting them in a row </span><span>you could go around the Earth more than 18 times.</span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/x18worlds.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Metal impact</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><span>Assuming a mass of 240 grams of metal per umbrella, every year 240,000 tons are completely wasted. It would be enough to build more than 25 Eiffel Towers every year.</span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/X25eiffeltowers.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Polyester impact</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><span>Every year you could cover a city like New York (700 Km²) with the umbrella canopies wasted in the world.  These objects are made in polyester, a material that biodegrade in 100 years.</span></p>

<p align=""justify""><span>These are the three basic rules that a sustainable product must meet. Ginkgo is 100% recyclable. Thanks to the rationalization of the components and the use of a single technology, the production steps have been reduced by 80%, and the increased longevity leads to a further reduction of the production process. Also, the ease of assembly and disassembly using snapfit joints guarantees the concrete possibility of reusing the still working components by replacing only the damaged ones.</span></p>

<p align=""justify""><span>Ginkgo è un innovativo ombrello compatto, riprogettato da cima a fondo ed interamente realizzato in un solo materiale riciclabile. È robusto e flessibile, in grado di assorbire urti casuali e raffiche di vento senza rompersi nè deformarsi, ma al tempo stesso leggero, colorato e caldo al tatto. E riciclabile al 100%.</span></p>
<p align=""center""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/dimITA.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><br/></p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/design%20innovativo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p align=""justify""><span>Il numero di componenti di Ginkgo è stato notevolmente diminuito, dai tradizionali 120 ad appena 20. Per l’assemblaggio non vengono utilizzate nè viti nè perni; tutti gli incastri sono realizzati mediante snap-fit che ne garantiscono affidabilità e durata nel tempo. Pochi componenti per ridurre al minimo le possibilità di rottura, ed opportunamente progettati per essere tutti realizzati con stampi ad iniezione.</span></p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/3%20flessibile.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p align=""justify""><span>I bracci non sono assemblati, ma realizzati in un unico pezzo di plastica flessibile. La particolare geometria brevettata gli permette di resistere al vento, flettendosi elasticamente e tornando in posizione senza deformarsi. Le giunture integrate sono progettate per durare migliaia di cicli di apertura e chiusura.</span></p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/PP.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p align=""justify""><span>Il polipropilene è un materiale onnipresente nella vita quotidiana. È stato scelto per Ginkgo perchè è fra i più leggeri materiali plastici, pur essendo estremamente resistente alle sollecitazioni meccaniche ed agli agenti chimici. Garantisce al tempo stesso flessibilità per i bracci e le giunture, robustezza e rigidità per il palo. Ed ovviamente, è totalmente riciclabile.</span></p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/5%20sostenibile.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p align=""justify""><span>Ginkgo è realizzato interamente in un unico materiale. Tutti i componenti, dal tessuto della copertura al filo delle cuciture, dal palo al pulsante di chiusura, sono in polipropilene. Tutti gli elementi di fissaggio, quali viti, perni ed in particolare colle, sono stati eliminati in favore di snapfit integrati nei pezzi. Questi accorgimenti rendono Ginkgo riciclabile così com’è, senza la necessità di separarne i componenti.</span></p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/colori.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p align=""justify""><span>Tutti i componenti di Ginkgo sono realizzati mediante la tecnica di iniezione in stampi. Ciò significa che ogni parte può essere colorata a piacimento, per una varietà virtualmente infinita di possibili combinazioni e personalizzazioni. E sotto la pioggia, un po’ di colore può fare la differenza.</span></p>

<p align=""justify""><span>Gli ombrelli attualmente in commercio sono teoricamente composti da materiali riciclabili quali plastica, metallo e legno. Vi è però il problema di doverli disassemblare per smaltirli correttamente, cosa che di fatto li rende non riciclabili e dannosi per l’ambiente. La tela in poliestere, ad esempio, impiega fino a 100 anni per biodegradarsi.<br/><br/></span></p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/forse%20non%20sapete%20che.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p><em>Impatto degli ombrelli</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><span>Ogni anno circa 1 miliardo di ombrelli vengono rotti, persi e buttati. Considerando un’altezza media di circa 75 centimetri ad ombrello, mettendoli in fila si potrebbe fare il giro della Terra più di 18 volte.</span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/18mondi%20ITA.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<p><em>Impatto del metallo</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><span>Considerando mediamente 240 grammi di metallo per ombrello, ogni anno ne vengono sprecate 240’000 tonnellate. Sarebbero sufficienti per costruire più di 25 Torri Eiffel.</span></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://ginkgoumbrella.com/Indiegogo/eiffeltowerITA.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Impatto del poliestere</em></p>
<p align=""justify""><span>Ogni anno si potrebbe coprire una superficie pari a quella di New York (700 Km²) con il tessuto delle coperture sprecato nel mondo. Questo tessuto è fatto di poliestere, un materiale che si biodegrada in 100 anni.</span></p>

<p align=""justify""><span>Queste sono le tre regole fondamentali che un prodotto ecosostenibile deve rispettare. Ginkgo è interamente riciclabile. Grazie alla razionalizzazione dei componenti e all’utilizzo di un’unica tecnologia, le fasi produttive sono state ridotte dell’80%, e la maggiore longevità comporta un’ulteriore riduzione della produzione. La facilità di montaggio e smontaggio tramite snapfit garantisce in oltre la concreta possibilità di riutilizzare le parti ancora funzionanti, sostituendo solamente quelle danneggiate.</span></p>

<p align=""justify""><span>Ginkgo è un progetto completamente italiano, sviluppato tra Milano, Roma e Bologna negli ultimi 3 anni.<br/><br/>Noi siamo tre ragazzi provenienti da background diversi e complementari: Federico Venturi, l'ideatore del progetto, un designer da sempre attratto dall’idea di realizzare e produrre le proprie intuizioni; Gianluca Savalli, ingegnere meccanico e laureando in ingegneria meccatronica, l’inventore di alcune soluzioni tecniche che hanno permesso all’idea di funzionare; Marco Righi, ingegnere gestionale e già amministratore di un’azienda, che con la sua esperienza ha portato il progetto ad un passo dalla realtà.<br/><br/></span></p>

FAQ
 











“Ginkgo Umbrella is redefining what an umbrella research and design on Indiegogo. Providing a durable and cool alternative, Ginkgo is making an impact in the environment while keeping people dry!”The Crowdfund Mafia [USA]




""Ginkgo is a clever way of reimagining the problem [of actual umbrellas] and using stronger rather than cheap materials to bolster the structure.”Stephen Courtney, Head of New Product Innovation at Dyson [UK]  





”Ginkgo promises a definitive jump to a brand new generation of eco-umbrellas.”   
Simone Cosimi [wired.it], Takeshi Otoshi [wired.jp]





 “...Ginkgo is a light object, but firm and flexible at the same time, easy to produce, assemble and customize.”  [Italy]







 “...strong and reliable: entirely made entirely of 100% recyclable polypropylene, flexible, able to resist strong winds without bending...”  [France] 




”... we won’t have to buy throw-away umbrellas at every rain drop falling from the sky, anymore…”
Ermanno Lucchini [Italy]
 




 “By reducing the number of parts and correcting the design, Ginkgo improved the product’s reliability, simplifying the production process, too. And without sacrificing style, as the umbrella is the definitive accessory for everyone’s outfit under the rain.” [Spain]



     


 ”... I’m sure that  most of you, after reading this, will also be looking forward to the next rainstorm so that you can try out one of these brightly colored umbrellas..”
Sara Nazzicone [ganzo.com, USA]




 
“This year the Italian first classified’s idea seems to be a very good one [about Ginkgo at James Dyson Award 2012].”
Aurelio Magistà [Italy] 
 



""Rainbow-framed, sustainably-made Ginkgo umbrella shows it's what's on the inside that counts""Designboom.com






Ginkgo is an innovative compact umbrella, re-designed from scratch and made entirely in just one recyclable material. It is stiff and flexible, able to absorb random impacts and windforce without breaking or bending, but also lightweight, colorful and warm to the touch. And 100% recyclable.


The number of Ginkgo components has been considerably reduced, from the traditional 120 pieces to just 20. The assembling procedure needs no screws or pivots, as all the couplings are obtained by long lasting and reliable snap-fit joints. With few components there is minimal chance of failure, and the design is favorable with production done by injection moulding.



The stretchers are not assembled, but made with a single piece of flexible plastic. The peculiar patented geometry allows them to resist strong winds by elastically flexing and returning into position without bending. The hinges are designed to last for thousands of open-close cycles.


Polypropylene is found everywhere in everyday life. It has been chosen for Ginkgo as it is among the lightest plastic materials whilst being extremely resistant to mechanical stress and chemical agents. At the same time it ensures flexibility to the stretchers and the joints, strength and rigidity to the pole. And of course it is completely recyclable.


Ginkgo is made entirely in a single material. All the parts, from the canopy’s fabric to the seams’ thread, from the pole to the closing button, are made from polypropylene. All the fastening elements, such as screws, pivots and especially glue, have been replaced by integrated snap-fit elements. Thanks to these solutions, when Ginkgo finally reaches the end of its useful life you can just toss it in the recycle bin. No need to disassemble the components.


All Ginkgo components are made by plastic injection moulding, meaning that each part can be coloured as desired, for a virtually infinite variety of possible combinations and customizations. And some cheerful colours under the rain can make a difference.


Umbrellas on the market today are theoretically made of recyclable materials such as metal, plastic and wood. However, they can’t be recycled as they are. They’d need to be disassembled to be properly disposed of, which means that most of them just end up going to landfill...a big waste of resources. The polyester canopy, as an example, takes up to 100 years to biodegrade.

Umbrellas' impact
Every year about 1 billion umbrellas are broken, lost, and improperly disposed of.
With an average length of 75 centimeters, putting them in a row you could go around the Earth more than 18 times.

Metal impact
Assuming a mass of 240 grams of metal per umbrella, every year 240,000 tons are completely wasted. It would be enough to build more than 25 Eiffel Towers every year.

Polyester impact
Every year you could cover a city like New York (700 Km²) with the umbrella canopies wasted in the world.  These objects are made in polyester, a material that biodegrade in 100 years.
(Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation)


These are the three basic rules that a sustainable product must meet. Ginkgo is 100% recyclable. Thanks to the rationalization of the components and the use of a single technology, the production steps have been reduced by 80%, and the increased longevity leads to a further reduction of the production process. Also, the ease of assembly and disassembly using snapfit joints guarantees the concrete possibility of reusing the still working components by replacing only the damaged ones.
German Pavilion at the 2012 Venice Biennale of Architecture (designboom.com)

Since all the components are made by injection molding, Ginkgo is ready to be made with zero-impact biodegradable polymers or, alternatively, to be produced in a cradle-to-cradle system, where all the material is completely recovered at the end of the product’s life and reused to produce it once again.


Ginkgo is an Italian design, developed in Rome, Milan and Bologna in the past 3 years.The three of us have very different but complementary backgrounds and educations: Federico Venturi, the project creator, a product designer who’s always been fascinated by the possibility of making his intuitions come real; Gianluca Savalli, mechanical engineer majoring in mechatronic engineering, the inventor of some of the technical solutions that made the initial idea work; Marco Righi, business engineer and company manager, whose experience and pacing pushed the project to where it is today.

At present Ginkgo exists as a series of fully working prototypes, obtained by temporary moulds and italian tailoring. We have already identified our industrial partners, and we’re ready to start the actual production of this object. These are our goals for the Ginkgo campaign:
coverage of the whole production line’s setup costs and production of the first series of Ginkgo, meant for the pioneering IndieGoGo contributors.
creating new multiple-cavity molds and production improvement.
research and development, especially focused on eco-friendly and biodegradable polymers, and set up of the cradle-to-cradle chain.

We have developed a widget to let you discover all of Ginkgo’s potential in terms of customization. You can find it here: play with the colours, combine them, and create your new, unique models!

With the 14 palette colours, Ginkgo’s possible combinations are almost endless.

For this crowd-funding campaign, Ginkgo is available to all the contributors in 4 lines of models with different features: Basic, Selection, Custom, and Deluxe. According to your contribution and the corresponding perk, you’ll be able to choose one or more of these models, customizing them as you desire.Take a look at the gallery to see all the available basic and selection models.












A simple and elegant Ginkgo: white pole, single-coloured ribs and details, white or black canopy.




20 multicolour models, with different unique colour combinations we created: these are our own favourite ones.





Every detail in this Ginkgo is customizable with the 14 palette’s colours, for more than 50 thousand trillion different combinations. The canopy is black or white.



The ultimate Ginkgo: all the components, including the canopy, can be chosen in any colour at will. Really, ANY colour.





 

Once you complete your contribution, you are granted access to our Gingko widget. You’ll receive an e-mail with your own credentials within 24 hours from the contribution.Using the widget you can choose your favourite models and save them in your personal area. To log into the widget, browse to www.ginkgoubrella.com/widget2 and click on the ""Pre-order"" button.

The personal area will show all of your perks. To pre-order more than one Ginkgo, you need to contribute more than once, picking one perk at the time. The additional perks will be added to your personal page within 24 hours, with no email notification.

To choose your favourite models, just follow this easy steps:1 - Log into the widget and click on the ""GO TO SELECTOR"" button;2 - Customise your model and click on the ""GO TO PREORDERS"" button; 3 - Click on the ""ADD"" button lo place the model as your perk.The page will refresh showing the model's preview where the add button was. When you're done, click the SAVE button to receive a pre-order recap by e-mail. You're free to manage and modify your pre-orders until the end of the Ginkgo campaign.

 
SHIPPING COSTS
You can add the shipping cost to the perk's contribution, or by making a different free contribution.
For example, if you live in Canada and you selected a Custom perk, the contribution field will display $ 25. To add $ 9 for postage, you'll have to manually type in $ 34. If you are going to choose more perks, you can add the TOTAL postage to one of the contributions.


To know the amount of the postage to add for your area, please refer to the maps below.




We expect to fulfill all received pre-orders by November 2013.

Ginkgo is the result of the enthusiasm and motivation that got us to this point. We are proud of what we have created, we strongly believe it's a huge step in the right direction, from any point of view. During the next few months we’ll be working on finishing the last details, organizing the production line, the shipments, and managing all the random contingencies. And in all this, your contribution will make the difference. If we managed to involve you, if you are as excited as we are about Ginkgo, consider being a protagonist in the success of this campaign! Support us with a donation to receive your own Ginkgo, have fun with our widget, and share worldwide your unique creation or just talk about us with friends and relatives, share our campaign, and let the world know about us!You can also find and join Ginkgo on: 
   
Thank you, 
The Ginkgo team
INDIEGOGO UMBRELLA FOR EVERYONE!

Tuesday 14/05 we surpassed our first goal of $ 30,000.
THANKS SO MUCH TO ALL OF YOU SUPPORTERS!!!
We cannot even start to describe how surprising was your overwhelming help to us!
To celebrate the first goal, and to thank you, we decided to present a Ginkgo to ALL the contributors that have purchased or will purchase 10 umbrellas or more! You will find a new ""Indiegogo Special"" perk in your personal page on the widget, with the unique celebrative IndieGoGo model pictured above. You're free to remove it and add your favourite model among the basic, selection or custom series. Postage free!
“I do love Ginkgo, but I cannot donate that much. Can I have the Indiegogo Special perk?”
Sure you can! We'll present a Ginkgo also to all the contributors that have brought or will bring friends to donate a total of $150 or more (that is the donation amount for 10 basic models). Here's how to do it:
1 - Log into IndieGoGo. If you don't have an account, you can use the ""Connect using your Facebook account"" feature.
2 - Browse to our campaign at www.indiegogo.com/projects/ginkgo-umbrella. You'll see that in the Share section under our pitch video the url will display a number at its end. That url is YOUR personal url.

3 - Use the embedded share buttons to share our campaign with your friends! Whenever someone clicks on it and donate to Ginkgo, we'll know that YOU sent him to our campaign page!
We still have other two goals to reach in 15 days. It's hard but definetly worth trying!
Thank you once againthe Ginkgo team

 

How do I get to choose 2 or more umbrellas?
You need to pick more than one perk (or the same perk twice), donating more than once, and adding the total postage to one of the contributions as explained here.

“Ginkgo Umbrella sta rivoluzionando il design e la progettazione degli ombrelli su Indiegogo. Fornendo un'alternativa d'impatto ed affidabile, Ginkgo preserva l'ambiente mantenendo la gente all'asciutto!”The Crowdfund Mafia [USA]




""Ginkgo rappresenta una rivisitazione intelligente del problema [degli attuali ombrelli], grazie all’uso di un materiale che rende l’intera struttura robusta e flessibile.”Stephen Courtney, Capo Nuovi Prodotti Innovativi Dyson, [UK] 





”Ginkgo [...] promette [...] di fare il salto definitivo verso una nuova generazione di ecombrelli.” 
Simone Cosimi [Italia], Takeshi Otoshi [Giappone]





“...Ginkgo, un oggetto leggero, ma allo stesso tempo robusto e flessibile, facile da produrre, assembleare e anche personalizzare...” 





“...resistente ed affidabile: realizzato interamente in polipropilene riciclabile al 100%, flessibile, in grado di sopportare raffiche di vento senza deformarsi...” [Francia]





”..non saremo più costretti ad acquistare ombrelli usa-e-getta a ogni scroscio d'acqua che cade dal cielo...”Ermanno Lucchini [Italia] 





“Riducendo il numero di componenti e migliorando la progettazione, Ginkgo ha aumentato l’affidabilità del prodotto, semplificando anche il processo produttivo.E senza sacrificarne lo stile, essendo l’ombrello il coronamento del look nei giorni di pioggia.” [Spagna]





”...sono certa che la maggior parte di voi, dopo aver letto l’articolo, non vedrà l’ora che piova per poter provare uno di questi coloratissimi ombrelli.”Sara Nazzicone, ganzomag.com [USA]





“Quest’anno quella del primo classificato per l’Italia sembra un’idea davvero buona [su Ginkgo al James Dyson Award 2012].”
Aurelio Magistà





""Bracci arcobaleno, eco-sostenibile, l'ombrello Ginkgo dimostra che ciò che conta è sotto la superficie.""
Designboom.com






Ginkgo è un innovativo ombrello compatto, riprogettato da cima a fondo ed interamente realizzato in un solo materiale riciclabile. È robusto e flessibile, in grado di assorbire urti casuali e raffiche di vento senza rompersi nè deformarsi, ma al tempo stesso leggero, colorato e caldo al tatto. E riciclabile al 100%.


Il numero di componenti di Ginkgo è stato notevolmente diminuito, dai tradizionali 120 ad appena 20. Per l’assemblaggio non vengono utilizzate nè viti nè perni; tutti gli incastri sono realizzati mediante snap-fit che ne garantiscono affidabilità e durata nel tempo. Pochi componenti per ridurre al minimo le possibilità di rottura, ed opportunamente progettati per essere tutti realizzati con stampi ad iniezione.



I bracci non sono assemblati, ma realizzati in un unico pezzo di plastica flessibile. La particolare geometria brevettata gli permette di resistere al vento, flettendosi elasticamente e tornando in posizione senza deformarsi. Le giunture integrate sono progettate per durare migliaia di cicli di apertura e chiusura.


Il polipropilene è un materiale onnipresente nella vita quotidiana. È stato scelto per Ginkgo perchè è fra i più leggeri materiali plastici, pur essendo estremamente resistente alle sollecitazioni meccaniche ed agli agenti chimici. Garantisce al tempo stesso flessibilità per i bracci e le giunture, robustezza e rigidità per il palo. Ed ovviamente, è totalmente riciclabile.


Ginkgo è realizzato interamente in un unico materiale. Tutti i componenti, dal tessuto della copertura al filo delle cuciture, dal palo al pulsante di chiusura, sono in polipropilene. Tutti gli elementi di fissaggio, quali viti, perni ed in particolare colle, sono stati eliminati in favore di snapfit integrati nei pezzi. Questi accorgimenti rendono Ginkgo riciclabile così com’è, senza la necessità di separarne i componenti.


Tutti i componenti di Ginkgo sono realizzati mediante la tecnica di iniezione in stampi. Ciò significa che ogni parte può essere colorata a piacimento, per una varietà virtualmente infinita di possibili combinazioni e personalizzazioni. E sotto la pioggia, un po’ di colore può fare la differenza.


Gli ombrelli attualmente in commercio sono teoricamente composti da materiali riciclabili quali plastica, metallo e legno. Vi è però il problema di doverli disassemblare per smaltirli correttamente, cosa che di fatto li rende non riciclabili e dannosi per l’ambiente. La tela in poliestere, ad esempio, impiega fino a 100 anni per biodegradarsi.

Impatto degli ombrelli
Ogni anno circa 1 miliardo di ombrelli vengono rotti, persi e buttati. Considerando un’altezza media di circa 75 centimetri ad ombrello, mettendoli in fila si potrebbe fare il giro della Terra più di 18 volte.

Impatto del metallo
Considerando mediamente 240 grammi di metallo per ombrello, ogni anno ne vengono sprecate 240’000 tonnellate. Sarebbero sufficienti per costruire più di 25 Torri Eiffel.

Impatto del poliestere
Ogni anno si potrebbe coprire una superficie pari a quella di New York (700 Km²) con il tessuto delle coperture sprecato nel mondo. Questo tessuto è fatto di poliestere, un materiale che si biodegrada in 100 anni.
(Fonte: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation)


Queste sono le tre regole fondamentali che un prodotto ecosostenibile deve rispettare. Ginkgo è interamente riciclabile. Grazie alla razionalizzazione dei componenti e all’utilizzo di un’unica tecnologia, le fasi produttive sono state ridotte dell’80%, e la maggiore longevità comporta un’ulteriore riduzione della produzione. La facilità di montaggio e smontaggio tramite snapfit garantisce in oltre la concreta possibilità di riutilizzare le parti ancora funzionanti, sostituendo solamente quelle danneggiate.
Padiglione tedesco alla Biennale di Architettura di Venezia del 2012 (designboom.com)

Essendo ottenuto esclusivamente per iniezione della plastica, Ginkgo è già predisposto ad essere realizzato con plastiche biodegradabili ad impatto zero o, alternativamente, ad essere completamente recuperato in fase di smaltimento e riutilizzato in fase di produzione secondo la logica cradle-to-cradle. 


Ginkgo è un progetto completamente italiano, sviluppato tra Milano, Roma e Bologna negli ultimi 3 anni.Noi siamo tre ragazzi provenienti da background diversi e complementari: Federico Venturi, l'ideatore del progetto, un designer da sempre attratto dall’idea di realizzare e produrre le proprie intuizioni; Gianluca Savalli, ingegnere meccanico e laureando in ingegneria meccatronica, l’inventore di alcune soluzioni tecniche che hanno permesso all’idea di funzionare; Marco Righi, ingegnere gestionale e già amministratore di un’azienda, che con la sua esperienza ha portato il progetto ad un passo dalla realtà.

Allo stato attuale Ginkgo esiste come serie di prototipi perfettamente funzionanti, ottenuti mediante stampi temporanei e sartoria italiana. Abbiamo già individuato i nostri partner industriali, ed è arrivato il momento di partire con la produzione vera e propria di questo fantastico oggetto. Questi sono gli obiettivi della campagna Ginkgo:
copertura del setup di tutta la linea produttiva e produzione della prima serie di Ginkgo, destinata ai pionieristici donatori di Indiegogo.
creazione di nuovi stampi multipli e miglioramento della produzione.
ricerca e sviluppo, in particolare su materiali plastici eco-compatibili e biodegradabili, e impostazione della catena di produzione-smaltimento in logica cradle-to-cradle, dove i materiali impiegati nella produzione vengono recuperati da noi post-consumo, e nuovamente utilizzati.

Abbiamo sviluppato un’applicazione (clicca qui) che vi permette di scoprire Ginkgo, giocare con i suoi colori e creare i vostri modelli unici.

Con i 14 colori della nostra palette le possibili combinazioni sono pressocchè infinite.

Per questa campagna di crowdfunding, Ginkgo è disponibile a tutti i donatori in ben 4 linee di modelli dalle diverse caratteristiche: Basic, Selection, Custom e Deluxe. A seconda della donazione potrete scegliere uno o più di questi unici modelli, personalizzandoli a piacimento. Visita la sezione “Perks” per maggiori dettagli sulle donazioni, e consulta la galleria di immagini per scoprire tutti i modelli basic e selection disponibili.












Semplice ed elegante: palo bianco, bracci e dettagli di un unico colore a scelta, telo bianco o nero.

<p>The vision of Ke’efa is to raise an awareness of peace and enlightenment in the world, especially in third world countries. Ke’efa means Light and Peace. It is a combination of two MINA-words: “Kekeli” and “N’tifafa”. MINA is a native dialect of Togo, West Africa. Kekeli stands for Light and N’etifafa stands for Peace. The Ke’efa logo reflects the sign of peace, which is the hand, and a sign of light, which is the candle. Most Ke’efa products come with messages of unity, love, self-confidence, hope, and ideas that invite us to unite and to help one another, to stop hurting each other, to stop greed, to stop bullying, and to stop violence, and to make peace wherever we are. </p>

Why have I created Ke’efa?

The vision of Ke’efa is to raise an awareness of peace and enlightenment in the world, especially in third world countries. Ke’efa means Light and Peace. It is a combination of two MINA-words: “Kekeli” and “N’tifafa”. MINA is a native dialect of Togo, West Africa. Kekeli stands for Light and N’etifafa stands for Peace. The Ke’efa logo reflects the sign of peace, which is the hand, and a sign of light, which is the candle. Most Ke’efa products come with messages of unity, love, self-confidence, hope, and ideas that invite us to unite and to help one another, to stop hurting each other, to stop greed, to stop bullying, and to stop violence, and to make peace wherever we are. 

 





Ke’efa and charity
30% of every sale goes to support a nonprofit organization I have co-founded. We are working to make third world countries better through the building of life improvement centers, and you can help through Ke'efa. Learn more about this cause at www.keefa1.com


The Next Step with Ke’efa

More Printing of products
Opening of Mall Kiosk (Booth) 

 The original logo of Ke’efa has three colors, but because of financial limitations, we could only print it with a single color right now. The next step with Ke’efa is to print more T-Shirts and open a local store.

<h2>A Gamer's Lifestyle</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Nail Jay, founder and creator of ""GamerSwag"" apparel &amp; accessories.  The GamerSwag concept originated from my love of art, video games and fashion.</p>
<p>I've been a gamer since I was old enough to hold a controller. The very first video game I played was ""Pong"", one of the earliest video arcade games released in 1972, (however I didnt play pong until the 80's, I'm not that old) and I've been a ""Hardcore Gamer"" ever since.<br/><br/>As an employee for various companies, I started noticing a self-induced pattern.  Every time there was a major video game release (such as: any of the Halo's, or GTA's, that's Grand Theft Auto for you non gamers out there) I would call off sick as well as take the next couple of days off work. I don't think my employers were too happy about this. In fact the very last time that I pulled that stunt, I end up losing my job (that was back in 2006). I made it up in my mind then &amp; there that whatever profession I chose in life would involve me working my own hours &amp; pace, as well as doing something that I love... playing video games!<br/><br/>The idea didn’t manifest itself until the end of 2011.  I began drawing designs with gaming themes while at work.  My fellow employees were so impressed that they began to ask me questions like, “If you have this much talent and skill then why are you even working here?""<br/><br/>It was at that moment that I knew my destiny... (hey wait! now that I think about it, maybe they just wanted my position!).  Well anyway, shortly thereafter I quit my job. I knew what I had to do. Ladies and gentlemen, I bring you GamerSwag!<br/><br/>Established in 2012,  GamerSwag is a Gamers lifestyle clothing Brand with a gaming theme and an urban feel, or swag if you will.  Please take some time to view some of our products. Below are just a few designs but there’s so much more to come!<br/><br/></p>

<h3>THE PASSWORD FOR THE VIDEO IS<span style=""color: #ff0000;""> indiegogopreview</span> (all lower case, all one word)</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">Error Guided Designs </span></h3>
<div>Error Guided Designs is the product of the trials and errors I have faced attempting to break into the fashion world. The goal has been, and will be, to make changes in the way this industry works by turning that which would normally be rejected into unique, personalized, items of practical beauty. Many of my most creative designs have come from situations where I was fighting against the norm, where I made a mistake, but all of these challenges have provided for the creation of things far more inspiring than that from which they came.</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jhv_HhvH4zM/TwhHF9FiZhI/AAAAAAAAAA0/etei0FAigPs/s320/4655_204778490713_664980713_7163476_2298622_n+%25281%2529.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span></p>
<div><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">Our Story </span></div>
<p>I've always had dreams of becoming a fashion designer. I worked hard to pursue this dream but found few role models who seemed to care about the art or creativity involved. Most seemed only interested in the profit to be had. I was becoming disillusioned and exhausted at fighting against the norm and was thinking that, perhaps, it was time to give up. Living with my mom and with no steady job (only odd jobs unrelated to fashion) finding motivation was a constant challenge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, one evening, my mom informed me that we would be having a young man over as our CouchSurfing guest and this was when things began to change.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I walked through the door that evening and found the most easy going, inspirational man I had ever met. Every night we ended up talking late with each other and I learned he was following his dream to become a filmmaker through IndieGoGo (see Glide's campaign here: <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/Writing-Acting-Love-2nd-Round-of-Funding"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">http://www.indiegogo.com/Writing-Acting-Love-2nd-Round-of-Funding</a> ). He encouraged me not to give up on my dreams and this re-awakened a passion to produce the one of kind fashion designs that had always driven me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dBih9bFIhy0/Twi5SIN9ROI/AAAAAAAAAEM/E7gsAXm69Mo/s320/TWO.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As the friendship grew and evolved into romance, so did my desire to prove to myself, and to the world, that dreams do come true: that passion, love, and persistence can make anything possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, embarking on an adventure in Malta, I am pursuing my dream to design couture garments from re-used materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am currently seeking funding to hire similarly ambitious creative people to join my venture, and to source materials and afford operations to create my first online fashion boutique - bringing re-designed clothing to the fashion cognoscenti. If you want to express yourself outwardly through what you wear while also appreciating art and creativity, Error Guided Designs can do that for you with customized clothing. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Error Guided Designs re-purposes what already exists instead of generating harmful waste such as through the creation of brand new material. We source all kinds of discarded clothes and materials and then re-interpret and re-design them to form couture clothing, all to specification and in collaboration with our buyers. This reduces the negative impact on the environment that clothing manufacture can have. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IDY_frnS2RE/Twi5TS-g6rI/AAAAAAAAAEU/eTiMLabu-tk/s320/ONE.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Error Guided Designs is also all about empowering local communities and businesses. I would like to give a chance to as many talented local artists as possible. I have met many amazing artists throughout the years that have not gotten the chance or acknowledgement they deserve, I want to change that. Where ever I find a talented artist I will work with them to bring their vision and art in to light. If this is not possible for any reason then I would like to promote their talent in any other way that I can.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QS8YZihjJt4/Twi5PrcjOEI/AAAAAAAAAEE/IwLMdvSniq4/s320/THREE.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>If this campaign doesn't happen a lot is at stake. Having sold pretty much everything I own to dive full on into pursuing this fashion dream it's a do or die moment for myself and the people that have known me. There is no safety net here - only a leap of faith in the power of community support to lift up a young entrepreneur to achieve success and who, in return, will provide color, and vibrancy, through creativity and art, in a way that will revitalize the fashion industry - moving away from a focus on profit, to a focus on sustainability and personal expression.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<div>Here is an estimate of start up costs:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$100,000 - Materials: although bulk of the materials are re-used they are not free. Also there will be materials that can not be bought used, e.g. thread, oil for machines, labels, packaging, office supplies etc (though we will partner with companies that use recycled products for these supplies when we can and as we find out about them).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$100,000 - Labor: The amazing people that I will hire to work for me have to be paid livable wages. The core team for a supply location would include: a seamstress, a graphic designer, an office assistant, and a pattern maker, to name a few (there might be others involved as budget and logistics allow)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$100,000 - Equipment: Sewing Machines, Dress forms, Overlock machines, computers, clothing racks, mannequins, irons, steamers,etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$50,000 - Legal / Payroll: incorporation, workers comp and liability insurance, employer / employee tax / licensing costs, and any other legal fees.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$50,000 - PR: Marketing, events, advertisements, etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>$40,000 - Living: Since this is going to be consuming all my time and energy it will also be my sole source of income and therefore I will be taking aprox 10% of funding to provide a living for myself while I pursue my goal.</div>
<div> </div>

Error Guided Designs 
Error Guided Designs is the product of the trials and errors I have faced attempting to break into the fashion world. The goal has been, and will be, to make changes in the way this industry works by turning that which would normally be rejected into unique, personalized, items of practical beauty. Many of my most creative designs have come from situations where I was fighting against the norm, where I made a mistake, but all of these challenges have provided for the creation of things far more inspiring than that from which they came.

Our Story 
I've always had dreams of becoming a fashion designer. I worked hard to pursue this dream but found few role models who seemed to care about the art or creativity involved. Most seemed only interested in the profit to be had. I was becoming disillusioned and exhausted at fighting against the norm and was thinking that, perhaps, it was time to give up. Living with my mom and with no steady job (only odd jobs unrelated to fashion) finding motivation was a constant challenge.
 
Then, one evening, my mom informed me that we would be having a young man over as our CouchSurfing guest and this was when things began to change.
 
I walked through the door that evening and found the most easy going, inspirational man I had ever met. Every night we ended up talking late with each other and I learned he was following his dream to become a filmmaker through IndieGoGo (see Glide's campaign here: http://www.indiegogo.com/Writing-Acting-Love-2nd-Round-of-Funding ). He encouraged me not to give up on my dreams and this re-awakened a passion to produce the one of kind fashion designs that had always driven me.
 

As the friendship grew and evolved into romance, so did my desire to prove to myself, and to the world, that dreams do come true: that passion, love, and persistence can make anything possible.
 
Now, embarking on an adventure in Malta, I am pursuing my dream to design couture garments from re-used materials.
 
I am currently seeking funding to hire similarly ambitious creative people to join my venture, and to source materials and afford operations to create my first online fashion boutique - bringing re-designed clothing to the fashion cognoscenti. If you want to express yourself outwardly through what you wear while also appreciating art and creativity, Error Guided Designs can do that for you with customized clothing. 
 


The Impact
Error Guided Designs re-purposes what already exists instead of generating harmful waste such as through the creation of brand new material. We source all kinds of discarded clothes and materials and then re-interpret and re-design them to form couture clothing, all to specification and in collaboration with our buyers. This reduces the negative impact on the environment that clothing manufacture can have. 

 
Error Guided Designs is also all about empowering local communities and businesses. I would like to give a chance to as many talented local artists as possible. I have met many amazing artists throughout the years that have not gotten the chance or acknowledgement they deserve, I want to change that. Where ever I find a talented artist I will work with them to bring their vision and art in to light. If this is not possible for any reason then I would like to promote their talent in any other way that I can.

 
If this campaign doesn't happen a lot is at stake. Having sold pretty much everything I own to dive full on into pursuing this fashion dream it's a do or die moment for myself and the people that have known me. There is no safety net here - only a leap of faith in the power of community support to lift up a young entrepreneur to achieve success and who, in return, will provide color, and vibrancy, through creativity and art, in a way that will revitalize the fashion industry - moving away from a focus on profit, to a focus on sustainability and personal expression.
 


What We Need & What You Get 
Here is an estimate of start up costs:
 
$100,000 - Materials: although bulk of the materials are re-used they are not free. Also there will be materials that can not be bought used, e.g. thread, oil for machines, labels, packaging, office supplies etc (though we will partner with companies that use recycled products for these supplies when we can and as we find out about them).
 
$100,000 - Labor: The amazing people that I will hire to work for me have to be paid livable wages. The core team for a supply location would include: a seamstress, a graphic designer, an office assistant, and a pattern maker, to name a few (there might be others involved as budget and logistics allow)
 
$100,000 - Equipment: Sewing Machines, Dress forms, Overlock machines, computers, clothing racks, mannequins, irons, steamers,etc.
 
$50,000 - Legal / Payroll: incorporation, workers comp and liability insurance, employer / employee tax / licensing costs, and any other legal fees.
 
$50,000 - PR: Marketing, events, advertisements, etc.
 
$40,000 - Living: Since this is going to be consuming all my time and energy it will also be my sole source of income and therefore I will be taking aprox 10% of funding to provide a living for myself while I pursue my goal.

Therefore, it seemed logical to create a product that would deter this habit.The first item that came in mind was a face shield. After all, the purpose of a face shield is, as its name suggests, to shield the face. Seeing that the standard ones on the market were bulky, uncomfortable, and far from aesthetically pleasing, we decided to design one that would combine style with safety—a face shield that would look and feel like a fashion accessory without compromising function.After months of nonstop design and sleepless nights, we finalized our design and launched Blocc on Kickstarter in the summer of 2020. Since then, Blocc has raised over $1 million worldwide and became one of the most popular personal protective equipment for everyday use.  FAQQ. Won't it fog up? Does it scratch up easily?A: Blocc is coated with anti-fog and anti-scratch coatings to mitigate fogging and minor scratches.Q: How should I clean Blocc? Can I use alcohol / lysol wipes?A: No, Blocc should be rinsed with dish soap and warm water only. U.S. ORDERSAll shipments in the U.S. are shipped via ground delivery from our warehouse in California within 3-5 business days after placing your order.

<h3>Hey!!</h3>
<p>How many times did you have to bring your own lunch into the office or to university? And have you ever noticed how annoying is it to carry an empty and dirty lunchbox in your bag all day long once you’ve finished eating? Today, we are happy to introduce a huge innovation for your lunch break: <strong>Vi Lunchbox.</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534670376/cq9rnou7olomhhbw2ipx.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Vi</strong> is the first <strong>foldable</strong> lunchbox that once emptied of its content can be folded and fitted into your pocket! Finally, after your lunch break you won’t have to carry around multiple plastic bags and you can simply forget about the existence of your lunchbox! Vi is only 14.5x12x1 cm (5.7x4.7x0.4 in) – officially making it the thinnest lunchbox in the world! Carrying around Vi will be like having a smartphone in your pocket, just more beautiful and colorful!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Vi is available in a range of <i><strong>6 different colors</strong></i>: yellow, pink, red, green, blue and transparent, so you can choose the one that best represents you!</p>
<p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534670501/wqyq4smbh9ecuvegh3li.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p>Vi has an <strong><i>hermetic</i></strong> and <i><strong>leakproof</strong></i> sealing system, therefore it can be filled with every kind of food, both solid and liquid. At the end of the meal, the dirty part of the box can be folded upon itself, so that it doesn’t come into contact with other surfaces, so you can avoid the risk of dirtying your pocket or bag.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The history behind Vi</h3>
<p>Firstly, let’s introduce <i><strong>our team</strong></i>: we are <i>Manfredi</i>, <i>Enrica</i> and <i>Riccardo</i>, three Italian students who took advantage of their experience at university to create Vi Lunchbox. During our student years, in order to save money and eat healthily, we brought our lunch from home, and countless times we had to deal with the annoying encumbrance of a big, empty lunchbox in our backpacks, taking up space that could instead be used for important things… such as books! Numerous times we had to bring our empty lunchboxes to the cinema or to an exhibition, and this lead us to think, ‘is there really not another solution?<br/>The idea of creating Vi came about in September 2017, and was inspired by Manfredi’s interest in the usage of Chinese origami as a means to improve the life-quality of astronauts. He thought, ‘Why not apply the origami folding principle to a lunchbox? In this way, once the lunchbox has been emptied, it can be folded and it won’t take up so much space in your bag!’ In the first phase of product’s development, we spent months watching origami tutorials, looking for the perfect design. To our minds, the product’s design was crucial, as we did not want to create another of the many functional, but plain-looking lunchboxes. We wanted to create the perfect lunchbox, that would meet the publics’ needs also from an aesthetic point of view - an object both functional and pleasing to the eye. </p>
<p>Vi’s current design is minimal - simple and elegant. We believe it truly embodies ‘Made in Italy’, something we are proud to bring to the world!</p>

<p>Once we had settled on a design, we started to engineer the perfect lunchbox, carefully selecting materials, measurements, machines and modes of production.<br/>Over the past few months, we have been constantly asking for our followers’ advice whilst working. In fact, for us, what matters the most is that Vi turns everybody’s lunchbreak into an enjoyable moment! As a result, after less than a year, three students without money, but with an innovative idea, had conceived a new philosophy for lunchtime.</p>

However, we will do everything in our power to keep our promises. As of now, we are in touch with multiple suppliers/producers so that we can test their materials and machines, in order to create the perfect product in terms of quality and duration. We have advised delivery time to our customers, in order to ensure we have time to deal with any issues that may arise. However, we hope to dispatch the lunchboxes much before this! We will do everything we can so that our customers are going to receive Vi even before the estimated delivery date!",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

Through our work with the Turquoise Mountain Foundation, we discovered a side to Afghanistan rarely seen in the media. Talented craftsmen using age-old techniques and local natural materials to create objects with lasting character and soul. Afghanistan’s craftsmen - like many of those in other countries at war - face a single common challenge: how to get their work in front of customers abroad?With this question in mind, last December we set up a beta site selling three simple types of cufflinks. The response was phenomenal. We sold ten times the number of cufflinks we initially expected to sell. What started out as a week of work for the young group of Kabul jewellers we were working with, turned into five weeks of full-time employment.It was enough evidence for us to leave Afghanistan to set up our own e-commerce platform.  
The slow process. Taking time with methods and materials to create objects with lasting value.
Pairing top international designers with craftsmen in cut off regions. Ancient craftsmanship guided by modern design.
The power of beautiful objects to spread positive stories about countries where such news is rare.   
Conscious consumerism - where your purchase creates economic opportunity in areas of need.
 Afghanistan has been ranked by the World Bank as the 166th (out of 168 countries) most difficult place with which to do business in the world… so there’s a reason why these craftsmen are cut off! One of the main problems we face is that as a landlocked country shipping fees from Afghanistan are enormous.  By reaching our target for preorders we will be able to reach big enough quantities to bring down these shipping costs, passing on these savings to you – the customer.It will also allow us to:
Build a website which does our products justice
Expand our network of craftsmen and designers
BUT, and here's an important detail, if this campaign is unsuccessful we will not have the resources to continue with the business. Our Perks represent one part of our collection. If this campaign is successful we will launch our full range in October 2016.  Last March we went to visit Ghulam Sekhi in his mudbrick workshop in Herat. He is one of last remaining glassblowers in Afghanistan, belonging to a tradition dating back centuries. It would be a tragedy to see this precious industry die with his knowledge. We believe a successful Indiegogo campaign will help us get this industry back on its feet. Our jewellery is made by a group of six jewellers called Blue Diamond. Despite being all under the age of 25, they like making jewellery the traditional way: 100% made by hand. We are passionate about helping young entrepreneurs in difficult environments grow their businesses. With Afghanistan facing economic crisis, employment for Afghanistan’s youth has never been more important. Afghanistan is one of the world’s last great carpet producing countries: famous for the luxurious quality of its local wool and the vivacity of its natural plant dyes.The slow process by which carpets are made is something of enormous rarity in our fast-paced world. Each rug is the result of hundreds of hours of concentrated work. Teams of up to five women weave the carpets at any one time, with carpets such as the Gehry and Hadid, taking more than four months to weave. Our social Impact model is built on three pillars. Here's how it works: After the campaign ends, you'll receive a survey to submit all the information. We will ask you for your shipping information, size, style and color as applicable.It depends which reward you go for! While ISHKAR jewellery, handblown glass and the knives do not include contributions to NGOs, a percentage of the value of all Kilims, carpets and trays is invested back into development programs. This varies from 5% for trays right through to 50% for Kilims, and 80% for the Frank Gehry carpet. Our partner NGOs are the Turquoise Mountain Foundation and Arzu.For specified perks shipping is not included. The shipping fees are given at a reduced rate and are calculated according to the destination. Please also bear in mind that you'll be responsible for custom or duties on your end, unfortunately we cannot include that into our costs.Unfortunately we are not able to handle returns at this stage.‘ISHKAR’ is the Persian word for a shrub found only in the deserts of northern Afghanistan. For thousands of years ISHKAR’s ash has been gathered and mixed with dyes to bring out the intense colour present in so many of Afghanistan’s crafts, from carpets, to ceramics and handblown glass.Not only does ISHKAR represent the alchemy which lies behind the craftsmanship, a desert plant with extraordinary properties, also seems a fitting emblem for Afghanistan & Syria at a time when much of the world sees little else from them but war and poverty.Version FrançaiseNous venons tout juste de rentrer d’Afghanistan après y avoir vécu pendant trois ans. A travers notre travail avec la Fondation Turquoise Mountain, nous avons découvert un aspect de ce pays peu couvert par les medias: des artisans talentueux utilisant des techniques ancestrales et des matériaux naturels afin de créer des produits ayant une âme.Les artisans Afghans – comme ceux de beaucoup d’autres de pays en guerre – font face à un obstacle commun : comment rendre ces objets accessibles au consommateur étranger ?Dans cette optique, nous avons monté en décembre dernier un site beta vendant trois types de boutons de manchette. La réaction fut extraordinaire. La semaine de travail de notre groupe de jeunes bijoutiers de Kaboul, s’est transformée en 5 semaines à plein temps.Ainsi nous avons quitté l'Afghanistan pour démarrer notre propre site de vente en ligne.
De l’élaboration lente et progressive de la confection. Prendre le temps avec des méthodes et matériaux uniques pour créer des objets avec une valeur durable.
De mettre en avant des collaborations avec des designers internationaux. Un artisanat ancestral mais résolument moderne et design
Que les beaux objets ont: diffuser des histoires positives sur certains pays - radicalement différentes de celles que l’on imagine trop souvent.
D’une consommation responsable - ou chaque achat cree des opportunités économiques dans des zones de besoin.

Designed for ultimate efficiency. STORYMost of us have one bag for work, and another bag for play. Carrying multiple bags to the office is inconvenient and unprofessional. So wouldn’t it be better if you had one bag that adapted for both work and play? A bag that you can take to work, and instantaneously transform for play whenever you need it. We couldn't find this bag, so we decided to make it. INTRODUCING THE 7VEN MESSENGERThe 7ven Messenger is specifically designed for you - the digital nomad, the professional, the entrepreneur, the adventurer, the creative, and the athlete. It is created for people that are passionate and motivated to pursue their life dream. With the capacity of a duffel bag, the style and functionality of a messenger bag and the professionalism of a briefcase, the 7ven Messenger is three bags merged into one. The minimalist external design and its endless versatility makes the 7ven Messenger a bag that you can use every day of the week, for WORK & PLAY. FEATURES HIGHLIGHTS   DESIGNED FOR WORKSIMPLE AND ELEGANT STYLEThe simple and elegant black design means you won't look out of place even when you are in your full work attire. THREE MODES OF CARRY You can change between three modes of carry (shoulder, messenger, or carry) by using the quick adjusting shoulder strap.Three modes of carry for added versatility:Quick strap adjustment to switch between messenger, shoulder, and briefcase style.For him and her. TOUCH OF CLASSCarry handle wrapped in leather to give a better carry experienceLeather-wrapped bottom corner for that touch of class. The bottom of the bag is also lined up with 4 low friction nylon feet that protect the bag from getting dirty. They also make the bag very easy to retrieve from the airplane overhead compartment.  HASSLE FREE TRAVELA convenient quick access pocket in the shoulder strap, for your money and/or transport travel card.Dedicated hidden external phone pocket for easy phone storage 7ven Messenger triangular shape ensures easy storage and retrieval from air-cabin's overhead bins. ORGANIZED FOR THE DIGITAL CENTURYA dedicated front pocket to carry all your tech gear and cables.Perfect for everyday carry. Fits all your essentials.   DESIGNED FOR PLAYLIFE-PROOF FABRICWater and stain resistant. Very easy to clean.COMFORTALPAKA 7ven Messenger is designed to reduce shoulder load when used in messenger mode. Apart from the wide, padded shoulder strap and body-hugging shape, we also designed a revolutionary new Mag-lock™ magnetic chest strap (with one finger operation magnetic locking), which allows significant weight to be distributed evenly across the back. The Mag-lock chest strap is so cool you'll want to use it everyday.You can deploy or tuck away the Mag-lock™ chest strap without having to look at it, and with a simple one click operation (with or without gloves on). Cool and efficient.  ADAPTABLE STORAGE SPACE The unique triangular shape of the 7ven Messenger means it will adapt to your load by simply changing its shape. The bag also has an unique OVERLOADABLE design that increases internal storage space by more than 30% when you need to overpack your bag. GREAT FOR ANY ACTIVITY The 7ven Messenger's body-hugging shape and Mag-lock™ magnetic chest strap ensure that the bag is stable enough for any activity. Whether you're riding a bike, or free-running through your urban environment.       U-LOCK STORAGEWe love riding our bikes to work, so we understand the importance of having a dedicated storage pocket for U-lock.TRIPOD MOUNTTripod holder with Mag-lock strapPLAY SAFEPadded bottom and back for added drop protection.It also has a Reflective Strip makes night riding safer.  ZERO EFFICIENCY-DRAG7ven Messenger is designed for pure efficiency. On average, when using the 7ven Messenger every day of the week (when compared to other messenger bags), you can save up to 10 minutes a day. That's over an hour a week and more than 50 hours saved in a year. If you earned $10 USD a hour, a saving of 50 hours a year is equivalent to saving of $500 USD a year. 
 

 SPECIFICATIONSWe chose the highest quality and most durable materials possible, because we wanted to create a product that's durable. We're not a fast fashion company. We're here to make stylish and functional products that are long lasting.The 7ven Messenger's unique triangular shape has several advantages over traditional rectangular messenger bags:
It won't tip over.
This shape also allows the bag to sit closely to your back for a more ergonomic feel.
The triangular shape makes the bag look less bulky and keep a slimmer look even when it is full.
Greater storage capacity.
 Reinforced stitching, high quality zippers, materials and components make the 7ven Messenger exceptionally durable.  Every seam is carefully stitched.TESTED BY US We tested the 7ven Messenger for over 10 months by travelling with it TESTED BY OTHERSAs part of our commitment to achieve our quality goal, we sent many pre-production 7ven Messenger prototypes for testing and evaluation by different people and organizations. Are you an urban traveler that loves traveling light? But still want to have all the essentials like phone, camera, passport, wallets, keys, etc., with you at all times?This is why we created the Go Sling, a small sling bag that is designed to hold all your travel essentials in a light, sleek, and secure bag.When we designed the Go Sling, we imagined it as a travel sling bag that will go everywhere with you. With this in mind, we designed the Go Sling to be modular with a removable and reversible strap (for both left and right hand use), so that it will fit perfectly inside the 7ven Messenger. We also added a flexible and quick adjusting shoulder strap, which allows you to have many different wearing styles for maximum comfort and security. It's Dimensions are:
28cm Width
16cm Height
12cm Depth
    TECH DOPP KITThe Tech Dopp Kit is designed to keep all your personal digital gear organized every day of the week. It features specially designed compartments for all your digital gear. GYM CUBEMany people prefer to go to the gym before they go to work and then head to work straight after. But taking your used gym clothes in your work bag for whole day is not ideal, due to the strong odor. This is why we designed the 7ven Gym Cube, which can absorb most of the strong odors from used gym clothing.MADE IN JAPAN ODOR ABSORBING MESHWe worked with a Japanese fabric manufacturer to develop a special mesh fabric that absorbs almost all the strong odors associated with dirty gym clothes, whilst still offering strong breathability of mesh fabric.REUSABLE and WASHABLEThe smell absorbing mesh can be washed to recover the smell absorbing function.  REWARD LEVELS  DESIGNThe design and prototyping process was a long, expensive and life-learning journey. It took us more than a year to get from the initial design sketches to the final pre-production prototypes. Sometimes we had to work more than 100 hours a week to ensure that our prototyping milestones were met.Every aspect of the bag design was tested and scrutinized for usability and quality. We worked with many international companies to ensure that the we have the best processes in place for the manufacturing of the 7ven Messenger bag. Finally, we were able to produce more than 50 (fifty) 7ven Messenger bags prior to the Crowdfunding campaign to ensure that we can achieve our promised production schedule and quality target. Design Sketches for 7ven Messenger.Early prototypes of 7ven Messenger bags                German designed magnetic latches used in our Mag-lock Straps.  VALUE7ven Messenger is a duffle bag, a briefcase, and a messenger bag all rolled into one. How much would you expect to pay for a high quality messenger bag, a briefcase and a duffle bag?ABOUT ALPAKA                             ALPAKA company motto: ""Anything is possible""ALPAKA was founded in 2013 by two friends. We share a passion for fashion, technology and design. We also love to travel and explore the world, but at the same time we are young professionals who are immersed in the modern digital culture of the 21st Century. With this in mind, we realized that the current range of carry products (i.e. bags) have not really kept up with the world we live in, nor are they suitable for those who are looking to use one bag for both work AND play. So we decided to design an everyday bag that you could use for both work & play. This was how the 7ven Messenger was born.   FAIR WAGEAs part of our ethos, we believe that every product that we design and make, is done with both environmental and workplace sustainability in mind.In keeping with our workplace sustainability goal, we pay higher wage directly to the craftsmen who make the bags. After all, great products are only made by people who love what they do, and you can only love what you do, if you are paid fairly.HOW IS THE MONEY SPENTWe believe in making high quality products that stand the test of time, this is why we chose only the best quality fabrics, and parts for the 7ven Messenger. However, we also believe that quality products should be affordable. In keeping with our philosophy for quality and affordable prices, we negotiated hard with our suppliers to make sure we get the best possible prices for all the materials and parts we use in our bag.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I am a Senior at Academy of Art University in San Francisco California. I am a sustainable women's wear designer. I have been chosen to participate in our fashion show in May. My collection is based on geometric patterns, minimal seams, zero waste pattern making, subtraction cutting, transformation and organic fabrics. My collection focuses on low impact manufacturing and domestic sourcing. I am the first sustainable designer in over 2 years to show at our graduation fashion show. Academy of Art is the only school to show during New York fashion week during the fall and spring. The May fashion show is the largest and most professionally produced fashion show in the West Coast. Our guest of honors have included Vivian Westwood, Alexander McQueen, Ducky Brown and much much more </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having the collection created will show the fashion industry the importance of sustainable design. It will create an awareness about being eco- conscience. The fashion industry and the community would miss out on the beauty of a collection without waste and low impact manufacturing.

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I need $5500 for material cost. The materials needed to complete the collection would be organic wool, organic cotton jersey and brass trims. 40% of the construction will be sent to professional seamstresses. If the goal is not met the money still gathered will go towards fabric cost. Using only domestic fabrics makes it more expensive but the quality is much better than international sourcing. 20% of my fabric costs is being funded by the fabric company. I will make 2 people a garment of their choice (made to measure).</p>

<p><strong>Friends coming to this Indigogo site are saying, ""I DON'T GET IT!  HOW DOES THIS WORK? WHY ARE YOU DOING INDIEGOGO?""</strong></p>

<p><strong>(2) As a ""thank you"" for your contribution, you receive a ""PERK"" based upon the contribution made.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(3) Indiegogo was selected as the launching pad for ""The Dog On The Go"" to help get some early pre-launch exposure to the product.  Crowd funding is the newest and perhaps most intriguing way to fund a project or idea, so I thought I'd give it a try.</strong></p>

<p align=""left"">With businesses becoming increasingly dog-friendly, more Americans than ever are taking their dogs to work and traveling with their dogs.</p>
<strong><strong></strong></strong>
<p align=""left"">I learned the hard way that when you have a Dog On The Go, you not only need to have necessities, you also need to be prepared for the unexpected.</p>
<p align=""left"">I often found myself saying, ""<em>Oops! I forgot</em>…"", or ""<em>Wish I had</em>…"" or ""<em>Yuck! How am I going to clean THAT up?</em>""</p>
<p align=""left"">I tried to find a complete travel pack for dogs and when I couldn't find one,I ended up putting together the ideal travel pack for my dog Gracie. When a friend saw it she said, ""<strong><em>I need one of those</em></strong>,"" and another said, ""<em><strong>You should sell these!""</strong></em></p>
<h3 align=""left""><strong>So, here it is!  The Dog On The Go Travel Pack!</strong></h3>
<p align=""left"">Whether it's a day at the office, a car ride to the beach, a weekend getaway or a trip across the country, if YOU have a dog on the go, <strong>you’ll love The Dog On The Go Travel Pack! </strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Makes a great gift, too!</strong></p>

<h2 align=""left"">WHAT’S IN THE DOG ON THE GO TRAVEL PACK?</h2>
<p align=""left"">The Dog On The Go Travel Pack includes <strong>23 items</strong> I have personally needed when traveling with Gracie. Some are hard to find items like the PetScan thermometer strip. (Don’t know about you, but I can’t imagine using a rectal thermometer!)</p>
<p align=""left"">Other items are things you just wouldn’t think of until you need it, like the pet first aid kit or the carpet cleaner! Some you hope you never have to use - especially the personalized ""LOST"" poster, which you should never leave home without.</p>
<p>I tried and tested lots of products and here’s what’s included in the pack….</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The Dog On The Go Backpack</strong>. This durable polycanvas backpack measures 17"" x 12-1/2"" x 7"" and features a large interior compartment to hold all The Dog On The Go items. There is a front zippered pocket along with an easily accessible side pocket to hold the water bottle. Two adjustable shoulder pads and a nylon carrying strap make for flexibility in carrying.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Water Bottle</strong>. We tested several, and this is THE BEST travel water bottle/bowl on the market!! It is leak-free even when held upside down and the wide-mouth bottle allows you to easily fill it with water and even ice. Extra water left in the bowl tips back into the bottle, so there is no wasting water when you’re out-and- about. Includes a belt or waist-band clip as well. BPA free and dishwasher safe (top rack).</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Travel Food Container/Bowls. </strong>This multi-purpose self-contained travel food container is a terrific way to not only hold the kibble (about 8 cups), but includes easily removable food and water bowls! The airtight container keeps food fresh and its compact design allows you to provide easy feeding when on the go. Your choice – Pink or Blue. <em>Gracie and I both LOVE this!!</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pet First Aid Kit.</strong> Pet emergencies happen, so it’s important to have what you need to comfort your pet until you can seek professional help. Being prepared will be of comfort to you too! Our first aid kit contains: 3 antiseptic towelettes; 4 ear cleanser swabs; 2 2'' x 3'' non-adherent pads; 2 2'' x 3'' adhesive pads; 1 set of gloves; 1 tweezers; 1 roll of tape; 1 scissors; 1 pet first aid guide.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PetScan Dog Thermometer Strip.</strong> Simply place the PetScan dog thermometer strip on your dog’s belly to determine if they have an elevated temperature. Temperature is indicated by the color change of the paws on the front of the thermometer strip. <em><em>(Personal experience: Gracie got real sick on one trip. The first thing the vet asked when I called was if she had a fever!)</em></em>
</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>""<strong>Dog in Car""sign</strong>. This sign affixes to the window with a suction cup to alert first-responders in case of an accident that your dog is in the car. <em><em>(Note: Please be sure your dog is safely secured when riding in the car!)</em></em>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Waste Bags with Dispenser. </strong>It’s not only courteous to pickup after your dog, in some places it’s the law. This bone-shaped dispenser can be attached to the outside of The Dog On The Go backpack, or onto your leash, if you prefer, so you can always be prepared! Contains 20 waste bags.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Personalized ""LOST DOG"" poster.</strong> Can you imagine being away from home and losing your dog? We hope it NEVER happens, but it’s important to be prepared. The Dog On The Go pack includes a personalized LOST DOG poster. Just send us photos (up to three) of your dog, along with a description, breed, gender, microchip number (if applicable), contact numbers (up to two) Contact name(s) (first name only, up to two).</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Document Holder.</strong> This document holder will allow you to neatly keep and organize certain documents you should always have when traveling with your dog, such as a copy of their vaccination certification, insurance information and the Lost Dog poster.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Super-absorbent drying towel.</strong> Rain, puddles or a dip in the lake will get your dog on the go wet. You can be prepared for any situation, including if you have to give your dirty dog a quick bath, with this super-absorbent 20.5"" x 12.5"" drying towel. It is designed to absorb 10 times its weight in liquid, and will dry your dog quickly without affecting the coat.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Dual sided dog brush.</strong> If your dog is long or short-haired, and whether or not it sheds, grooming while ""on the go"" is important. One side of this wooden-handled brush has soft bristles, and the other metal pins.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Treat Bag.</strong> At home or on the go, we all know how much our dogs love treats! This treat bag will keep your dog’s favorite treats easily accessible. Contains an inner drawstring, and a clip to attach to your belt or The Dog On The Go backpack.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Treats!!</strong> (6 oz) These bacon flavored treats include vitamins and Omega 3s &amp; 6s. Made in Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Carpet spot remover and deodorizer. </strong> (13 oz)<strong> </strong>Even the most housebroken dogs can have an accident in a hotel room or when you’re a guest in someone’s home. You’ll be prepared to clean it up!</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lint brush.</strong> Although we love our dogs, we don’t love wearing their fur on our clothes. Since even dogs that don’t shed have loose hairs that stick to clothing, you’ll need The Dog On The Go lint brush that grabs the hairs to wipe them away.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Spare Leash.</strong> It’s not unusual to lose or misplace a leash, and when it happens away from home, it’s not always easy to find a place to buy one. The Dog On The Go travel kit includes a 6’ nylon leash with a wrist strap and metal spring clip latch.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rope/ball toy.</strong> Great for tugging, retrieving or just chewing this rope toy promotes hours of exercise while having fun. Toy is made of tightly wound rope and is threaded through a tough tennis ball.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Potty Pads.</strong> Whether you’re traveling with a new puppy or an adult dog, these 22"" x 21-1/2"" potty pads are a necessary ""just-in-case"" item, even if your dog is completely housebroken. These extra-absorbent pads have a plastic bottom to protect floor surfaces. <em>(Personal experience: Works great in an airport’s rest-room handicap stall!)</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Disposable gloves.</strong> For those unexpected messes, especially if your dog gets ill, the Dog On The Go travel kit includes 10 (5 pair) of disposable gloves. (One size fits most,) <em>(Personal experience: Hmmm... I think I’ll spare you the details! The gloves are definitely a must-have item!)</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Anti-bacterial hand wipes.</strong> Since you never know what unpleasant things might get on your hands when traveling with your dog, the Dog On The Go travel kit includes anti-bacterial hand wipes for those ""just-in-case"" times. Includes<span lang=""""><span lang=""""> 36 fresh scented alcohol free antibacterial sanitizer wipes. Sanitizer kills 99.9% of germs when used correctly. (<em>Personal experience: I’m sure I’m not the only one who has gotten ""Resi-doodoo"" on my hands. EWWW!)</em></span></span>
</li>
</ul>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Paw/Body Wipes.</strong> (15) A Dog On the Go is likely to go through dirt, mud or even blacktop that gets their paws dirty. These 9""x 9"" wipes provide a fast and easy way to clean those dirty paws, as well as to wipe away overall dirt, odor and even dander from their coat. (<em>Personal experience: An absolute travel must especially for white and light colored dogs!</em>)</li>

<p>Above is a picture of Syndicate Brand HQ, where all of our products are made.</p>
<h3>Who we are and why we're here!</h3>
<p>We are Syndicate Brand, a sustainable jewelry, apparel, and lifestyle brand based in Oakland, CA. We produce cutting edge, original looks for men and women made of upcycled. We use sustainable and salvage woods, metals, fabrics, and more and transform them into beautiful things from jewelry to furniture. Up until now, the craft inside Syndicate Brand has been edgy, unique, and put together in the best ways possible with the few tools we have. Now, we need new tools and machines to help us produce more and better quality goods which we can sell to more stores, and we're hoping you can help!</p>
<h2>Our designs + Our designers!</h2>
<p><img alt=""MIXED ITEMS"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-cache-ak1.pinimg.com/originals/e3/bd/bb/e3bdbb6534a3353c6928ecb621bde155.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT: Button down shirt made from upcycled denim, Mahogany Portal Pendant w/ Glass, Survival Kit Earring St, Bubinga Hardwood Ring, Denim/Sterling Bracelet Convertible, Wenge Hardwood Ring with gift-box~</p>
<p>Syndicate Brand is truly based on design and the elements of social responsibility, which are both built into each product that we intend to make. Everything made by S.B. is done so in Oakland, CA right here in this studio, and has a strong history in the Bay, though is inspired by a great multitude of other designers and crafters the world round. Based on collecting materials from flea markets, art suppliers, or sustainable lumber companies, we have come up with many excellent and fiery accessories over the past few years. Our passion is definitely pushing towards newer and more expansive ideas for both the products and how we can give back to the community.</p>
<p>Currently, we have a tremendous previous collection, comprised of one-of-a-kind necklaces and several made-to-order pendants, along with our brilliant and popular Hardwood Rings in two bold styles, along with a few other collections of accessories, all of which is available as gifts for donating to our cause! </p>
<p>Though we have some means to continue making our products and hopefully adding some new ones, the prospect becomes difficult as some tools, equipment and materials are certainly needed to adapt. This is where you come in to help~ By contributing to our cause, we will be more able to add our new pieces, such as woven wristwear, brand new long sleeve shirts from sustainable fabrics, and a really spectacular and surprise addition to our jewelry lines! Lastly, we have also been working on a separate collection of hygienic and personal lifestyle products which will be made from all organic ingredients!</p>
<p>All of this and many new designs are in the works and we're readying ourselves for the ability to machine and handmake our new items for you and the world-</p>
<h2>Social responsibility</h2>
<p>What we've begun doing, as a token of our love for culture, is giving 33% back of all product sales to a small program of food donation in the bay area~ Whatever we make after we've invested our IndieGoGo funds is definitely apart of this idea and we intend to continue giving back to the people!</p>
<h2>What we will do with the funds</h2>
<p>We are asking for $3000 because we've done our homework, and the tools and materials required to make our new lines fit well into this figure, such as the Micro-Lathe which will help with some of our jewelry which costs $600 by itself, along with the materials to compose the jewelry and new shirts and clothing, which usually equal to $10 of average material costs per piece! If you add it all up, we certainly aren't asking for more than we need~</p>
<p>Here are some more details about where the money will go:</p>
<p>Facility Rent- $400</p>
<p>Tickets to Event- $300</p>
<p>Micro-Lathe- $595</p>
<p>Serger Sewing Machine- $200</p>

</div></div>","Above is a picture of Syndicate Brand HQ, where all of our products are made.
Who we are and why we're here!
We are Syndicate Brand, a sustainable jewelry, apparel, and lifestyle brand based in Oakland, CA. We produce cutting edge, original looks for men and women made of upcycled. We use sustainable and salvage woods, metals, fabrics, and more and transform them into beautiful things from jewelry to furniture. Up until now, the craft inside Syndicate Brand has been edgy, unique, and put together in the best ways possible with the few tools we have. Now, we need new tools and machines to help us produce more and better quality goods which we can sell to more stores, and we're hoping you can help!
Our designs + Our designers!

 
CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT: Button down shirt made from upcycled denim, Mahogany Portal Pendant w/ Glass, Survival Kit Earring St, Bubinga Hardwood Ring, Denim/Sterling Bracelet Convertible, Wenge Hardwood Ring with gift-box~
Syndicate Brand is truly based on design and the elements of social responsibility, which are both built into each product that we intend to make. Everything made by S.B. is done so in Oakland, CA right here in this studio, and has a strong history in the Bay, though is inspired by a great multitude of other designers and crafters the world round. Based on collecting materials from flea markets, art suppliers, or sustainable lumber companies, we have come up with many excellent and fiery accessories over the past few years. Our passion is definitely pushing towards newer and more expansive ideas for both the products and how we can give back to the community.
Currently, we have a tremendous previous collection, comprised of one-of-a-kind necklaces and several made-to-order pendants, along with our brilliant and popular Hardwood Rings in two bold styles, along with a few other collections of accessories, all of which is available as gifts for donating to our cause! 
Though we have some means to continue making our products and hopefully adding some new ones, the prospect becomes difficult as some tools, equipment and materials are certainly needed to adapt. This is where you come in to help~ By contributing to our cause, we will be more able to add our new pieces, such as woven wristwear, brand new long sleeve shirts from sustainable fabrics, and a really spectacular and surprise addition to our jewelry lines! Lastly, we have also been working on a separate collection of hygienic and personal lifestyle products which will be made from all organic ingredients!
All of this and many new designs are in the works and we're readying ourselves for the ability to machine and handmake our new items for you and the world-
Social responsibility
What we've begun doing, as a token of our love for culture, is giving 33% back of all product sales to a small program of food donation in the bay area~ Whatever we make after we've invested our IndieGoGo funds is definitely apart of this idea and we intend to continue giving back to the people!
What we will do with the funds
We are asking for $3000 because we've done our homework, and the tools and materials required to make our new lines fit well into this figure, such as the Micro-Lathe which will help with some of our jewelry which costs $600 by itself, along with the materials to compose the jewelry and new shirts and clothing, which usually equal to $10 of average material costs per piece! If you add it all up, we certainly aren't asking for more than we need~
Here are some more details about where the money will go:
Facility Rent- $400
Tickets to Event- $300
Micro-Lathe- $595
Serger Sewing Machine- $200
Rock Tumbler- $100

<p style=""font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal; color: #666; font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4em;"">I get excited about products with great design that seem to utilize the simplest solutions for every day problems. A few years ago I found myself in a conundrum that I just couldn't get off my mind. I started to take a look at the current ceiling fans installed in my house and was unsatisfied with their look and performance. My wife and I decided it was time to replace our outdated fans, but were even more disappointed in the options that were available on the market. It was in that moment that inspiration struck. ""Cyclonic air movement""</p>
<p style=""font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal; color: #666; font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4em;"">Studying the science surrounding Nikola Tesla's bladeless turbines led me to a breakthrough that I knew was the perfect solution to the problem that was plaguing my thoughts. In 2005 the first bladeless ceiling fan was born. It wasn't aesthetically pleasing nor was it overwhelmingly functional, but it worked! Over the next few years, many prototypes and design changes were created, and the product started to take shape.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 10pt; font-weight: normal; color: #666; font-style: normal; line-height: 1.4em;"">Today with the help of my co-founder, Richard Halsall, we have been able to develop that initial thought into the world's first truly bladeless ceiling fan. Exhale Fans continued goal is to constantly innovate in the ceiling fan industry and bring inspiring designs to those who love innovation as much as we do.</p>

Breaking Convention
I have always been interested in innovation, combining simple solutions with elegant design.  The Exhale was inspired by 19th century inventor Nikola Tesla and is the world's first truly bladeless ceiling fan.  It utilizes the science of laminar flow between an array of flat disks to efficiently move air throughout your environment.  This laminar movement creates a smooth uninterrupted airflow with virtually no noise.





Vortex Airflow, Unmatched ComfortThe vortex airflow profile generated by the Exhale fan is unmatched in the ceiling fan industry. Air is not simply directed straight down, but moves around the room in a 360° horizontal flow.  The air passes over you from the side as if you were experiencing a cool spring day with its fresh-feeling and calm breeze.
     
This cyclonic airflow multiplies as the Exhale runs, mixing the air to eliminate hot and cold spots.  This complete homogenization of the air stabilizes the temperature, reducing stress on your air conditioning or heating system. Fewer cycles on your HVAC system results in lower heating and cooling bills.







We have made a 1/6th scale demo to show the vortex flow created by the Exhale fan. This test was performed in water with slightly less than buoyant material added to aid with the visualization. Enjoy!






Since our 1/6th scale water demo, we have been asked many times for a smoke filled full scale demo to show the vortex flow created by the Exhale fan.So we did, Enjoy!

What we've done:  For the past 18 months, Exhale fans has been perfecting the function and design through renderings, computer modeling, and prototypes.  We have started manufacturing our production tooling and it is nearing completion.
A high efficiency DC motor with 6-speed wireless remote has been sourced to bring the fan to life.  These DC ceiling fan motors reduce operating costs by 50%-80% over their AC counterparts.  We worked very closely with the manufacturer to custom build a model that will maximize the effectiveness of the laminar flow while not increasing power usage. 
What we are doing:  After receiving the first parts from our production tools, we are perfecting the fit and finish as well as selecting the proper material to be used.  Packaging engineers are already working on initial designs for our review and testing.  Prototyping and tool building is very expensive.  At this point, we have ""broke the piggy bank"" and need your help to finish what we have started. 
What we will do:  Our continued goal is to use our experience and advanced design techniques to build the best product for our customers.

Inventors Story -Nik Hiner
I get excited about products with great design that seem to utilize the simplest solutions for every day problems. A few years ago I found myself in a conundrum that I just couldn't get off my mind. I started to take a look at the current ceiling fans installed in my house and was unsatisfied with their look and performance. My wife and I decided it was time to replace our outdated fans, but were even more disappointed in the options that were available on the market. It was in that moment that inspiration struck. ""Cyclonic air movement""
Studying the science surrounding Nikola Tesla's bladeless turbines led me to a breakthrough that I knew was the perfect solution to the problem that was plaguing my thoughts. In 2005 the first bladeless ceiling fan was born. It wasn't aesthetically pleasing nor was it overwhelmingly functional, but it worked! Over the next few years, many prototypes and design changes were created, and the product started to take shape.
Today with the help of my co-founder, Richard Halsall, we have been able to develop that initial thought into the world's first truly bladeless ceiling fan. Exhale Fans continued goal is to constantly innovate in the ceiling fan industry and bring inspiring designs to those who love innovation as much as we do.




FAQs

Q: I have a vaulted ceiling, can I still get one?
A: Of Course! Down rods can be used for slanted/vaulted ceilings and are available at your local hardware store in various lengths.


Q: Why does the fan look wobbly?
A: The fan in the video is the first prototype test from the production tooling. (Discs were not perfectly flat)


Q: Where is the light?
A: We are currently working on LED based lighting systems. - ETA:Q2 2013. The fan does have a removable cap near the base of the central hub that houses an electrical junction box that will accept existing lighting kits.


Q: Is it easy to clean?
A: Yes... The leading edge of any fan will collect dust. Using a standard brush adapter with your vacuum removes it with ease. (Set the fan to low speed while cleaning!)


Q: Didn't Dyson make this already?
A: No... The Dyson air multiplier uses a high speed impeller motor to direct up and out a nozzle on the leading edge. The Exhale uses laminar flow and uniform circular motion to draw air through the fan.


Q: Does the fan make a lot of noise?
A: Not at all... The laminar flow makes virtually no noise and our DC motor has upgraded bearings for quiet operation. -Sound Analysis chart in the Tech Specs above.


Q: How does heating/cooling work, Do I need to reverse directions?
A: No... The spinning movement of the air generated by the Exhale homogenizes the air in the entire room. Summer or winter, there is no need to reverse directions like bladed fans.

<h3>What's This ""That's So Gay"" Business?</h3>
<p><span>Hello! I'm Alison Rowan, an 18 year-old graphic design student, and ""That's so gay"" is something I hear far too often, especially among people my own age. It's used to mean that something is stupid or uncool or otherwise negative, which is not only offensive, but frankly, it doesn't make the speaker sound like the sharpest tool in the shed, either.</span></p>
<p>These t-shirts and posters were designed to challenge the phrase by targeting the speaker and letting them know that they have so many other words to choose from—So many options which better articulate their point and don't have hurtful side-effects if they'd simply rethink their derogatory word choice a little, instead of contributing to negative connotations of homosexuality. </p>
<p>Hopefully this design will be able to get those who use the phrase to stop and really think about what they're saying, and how they're shaping the attitude of our culture in doing so. By contributing to this project and displaying a poster or wearing a t-shirt, you'll be helping to do just that. </p>

is close to being finalized, but we will continue to improve the bag aesthetically and functionally, so you receive the best possible product.  That may mean tweaking, adding, or removing small features.  The product is also built in genuine leather which is beautiful and soft, malleable and flexible, and our product will behave and age as such.  Please research the characteristics of leather and make sure it's a material that you're excited about buying.</p><p>Production generally takes ~2 months of time to create, but can vary based on a number of factors including large quantity of units to create, differences in material, unclear specs etc.  Because our zippers are YKK and extremely high quality, they take over 20 days alone to order.  However, our team has produced with our high quality factory before which has created items for many retailers including Calvin Klein.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true""

<li><p><strong>How did you get this idea?</strong>  This was born out of my own frustration of not being able to find bags that were sleek and elegant, while also being practical and useful.</p></li>
<li>
<strong>What does Tara mean?</strong>  The name, “Tara” is inspired and named after “Green Tara” the Buddhist mother goddess, who represents action, great strength, and the virtues of success in work and achievements.  We felt like this represented the women we were designing for.</li>
<li>
<strong>Who is the bag named after? </strong> We name products after women who inspire us.  Our first bag is named, “The Tracy,” after Tracy Chou – former Pinterest and Quora engineer and entrepreneur – for her work in diversity and women-in-tech.  Her blog post spurred 250 tech companies to release their otherwise well guarded diversity numbers so we could have a real conversation about diversity.</li>
<li>
<strong>What problems were you trying to solve?</strong>  There were two main problems we were trying to address with this bag: 1) The ability for distributed weight when you need it (a backpack), but to look professional when you want to (a shoulder bag).  2)  Stopping ""bags within bags.""  Too often we see women carry a smaller bag within a larger work bag because one bag doesn't suit their needs.  With the Tracy, you have a 2-in-1 bag, so you never need to again.</li>
<li>
<strong>I'm not ready to buy a Tracy, but I love your mission and would love to support!  How can I help?</strong>  We'd love your help!  If you'd like to make a smaller donation, feel free to grab a Tara Supporter Headphone Case for $25.  If you're not ready to buy, please help share our story with your family and friends.</li>

Stop purchasing bags for different occasions that won't hold up: Tara&Co can take you anywhere, anytime.     There were two main problems we were trying to address with this bag: 
The ability for distributed weight when you need it (a backpack), but to look professional when you want to (a shoulder bag).  
Stopping ""bags within bags.""  Too often we see women carry a smaller bag within a larger work bag because one bag doesn't suit their needs.  With the Tracy, you have a 2-in-1 bag, so you never need to carry two separate bags again.
You might wonder how we name our products -- we name products after women who inspire us.  Our first bag is named, “The Tracy,” after Tracy Chou – former Pinterest and Quora engineer and entrepreneur – for her work in diversity and women-in-tech.  Her blog post spurred 250 tech companies to release their otherwise well guarded diversity numbers so we could have a real conversation about diversity.  We're excited to honor her and name this bag after her.2-in-1 Bag Design.The Tracy is a 2-in- 1 convertible tote style bag in soft, genuine leather for the contemporary woman on-the- go. We're a bag that works for you.  We convert to provide four distinctive looks for work or evening functions.We're made for women who carry devices.  We fit up to a 13” laptop and have a zip-off clutch. Zip-off Clutch.Oh yes, we did!  The flap of your Tracy zips off to become a stand-alone piece, so you can grab your basics, and go.No more bags within bags.Women love to just take the clutch for lunch, dinner, or errands, when it's more appropriate to have a smaller bag.  Next time you don't have to lug everything, you can just take this.  The clutch comes with its own pocket and detachable strap. ​ 3-Way Wear.  Feel great wherever you are.  No more shoulders hurting, or feeling ""too young"" at a meeting.  Our easy slide-and- go strap allows the bag to be worn 3-ways -- shoulder style as a tote, a cross-body, or as a conventional backpack.  Just pull one up for a shoulder bag or cross-body, and pull out for a backpack.  It converts between them in a snap.  You don't have to deal with complicated conversions!Our straps are made with leather on the outside and a soft nylon on the inside to look great, but wear most comfortably in any situation.  Fits your life.We hold everything you need in your bag.  We know busy women have busy lives, so The Tracy is there to assist you. Personalized.  Sometimes you want to accessorize your outfit, or have a night out on the town.  That's why today we're releasing two other clutch colors - Cerulean Teal and Lava Red.  Use them in two ways: 1) Wear the clutches as their own piece or 2) Use them to easily change and personalize the color of your flap.  Our clutches come with their own pocket and strap so you can look great from day to night.Expandable Side Pockets.Sometimes you just need extra space.  That's why we've designed two expandable zip-out side pockets when you need them.  They sit sleek and flat along the side of your bag, but you can expand them out to hold water, an umbrella, or other needs. Easy Access Back Phone Pocket.  We know you have calls, texts, messages, and apps that you need when you're on-the-go, so we've developed an easy to reach back pocket which keeps your phone safe, secure, and easy to access. Organization.  We created lots of compartments for everything you bring everyday.  We polled hundreds of women on what they carry in their bags and designed a spot for anything that over 50% of women carried daily.This includes a padded pocket for devices, 2 zippered pockets, and places for your keys, sunglasses, lip gloss, pens, bus passes, and more. Best Materials.Your Tracy not only looks good, it feels good.  It's made out of genuine soft leather & the best YKK zippers.Bag Specs
Tote: Height: 14”, Width: 11”, Depth: 4”.  Please choose a strap based on height. Short Strap Length: 48” (under 5'4), Standard Strap Length: 60” (Everyone Else)
Clutch: Height: 6.5”, Width: 11”, Removable Strap Length: 20”
Genuine Soft Leather.   Weight: 3.5 lbs.
*Specs are subject to change before production to build the best product possible.We've tested with CEOs, consultants, teachers, mothers and more!  They love their Tracy bag which suits their needs for many occasions.This is a perfect gift for you, or the professional woman in your life.  Great for graduation gifts, business gifts, holiday gifts, or just to tell the woman in your life that you love her.Women who travel often, like consultants, no longer have to take two bags, they just take The Tracy and zip-off the clutch when they need something smaller on their trips.Every day women love The Tracy.  When you're running home from meetings, you can leave the tote of The Tracy in your car, and just take your clutch if you need to step out to the grocery store, mall, or meet up with a girlfriend.New mothers love The Tracy since they can put their baby in the front, and The Tracy in the back to look stylish and still carry the things they need for their new family. Since we're a 2-in-1 convertible bag, we get the best of both worlds.  Learn how we differ from pure backpacks and handbags.  The Tracy has it all.  We're a team of professional women, bag designers, and mechanical engineers.  I'm a former Facebook employee and longtime female founder.  We have a collaborative building philosophy so we constantly ask professional women what they want and need and design it into our bags.We've talked to and tested our bags with hundreds of women.  Our extended testers are excited and say they want to buy The Tracy.We want to solve problems for professional women and the challenges they face in their day-to-day lives.  Most products out there today are not designed for women who have dynamic lifestyles. With $45,000 you can help us contribute to our first run of ""The Tracy"" and help launch the Tara&Co brand to help reimagine products for real women everywhere.  We have bootstrapped the R&D process of the bag through 3 prototype cycles and six months of designing, re-designing, testing, iteration, and love, to get where we are today.   We're almost there.  We have a few tweaks left, and we're ready to produce. We're carefully fine tuning the rest of the bag, but will have it in your hands before the holidays! Like any startup, there are challenges and unforeseen circumstances.  However, we have brought products to market before and are confident in our ability to do it again.  Our product is close to being finalized, but we will continue to improve the bag aesthetically and functionally, so you receive the best possible product.  That may mean tweaking, adding, or removing small features.  The product is also built in genuine leather which is beautiful and soft, malleable and flexible, and our product will behave and age as such.  Please research the characteristics of leather and make sure it's a material that you're excited about buying.Production generally takes ~2 months of time to create, but can vary based on a number of factors including large quantity of units to create, differences in material, unclear specs etc.  Because our zippers are YKK and extremely high quality, they take over 20 days alone to order.  However, our team has produced with our high quality factory before which has created items for many retailers including Calvin Klein.Every startup takes an army to build, and we couldn't have done it without help from so many people.Special thanks to:

Can't wait to see you at another event near you.   About Us
How did you get this idea?  This was born out of my own frustration of not being able to find bags that were sleek and elegant, while also being practical and useful.

What does Tara mean?  The name, “Tara” is inspired and named after “Green Tara” the Buddhist mother goddess, who represents action, great strength, and the virtues of success in work and achievements.  We felt like this represented the women we were designing for.

Who is the bag named after?  We name products after women who inspire us.  Our first bag is named, “The Tracy,” after Tracy Chou – former Pinterest and Quora engineer and entrepreneur – for her work in diversity and women-in-tech.  Her blog post spurred 250 tech companies to release their otherwise well guarded diversity numbers so we could have a real conversation about diversity.

What problems were you trying to solve?  There were two main problems we were trying to address with this bag: 1) The ability for distributed weight when you need it (a backpack), but to look professional when you want to (a shoulder bag).  2)  Stopping ""bags within bags.""  Too often we see women carry a smaller bag within a larger work bag because one bag doesn't suit their needs.  With the Tracy, you have a 2-in-1 bag, so you never need to again.

I'm not ready to buy a Tracy, but I love your mission and would love to support!  How can I help?  We'd love your help!  If you'd like to make a smaller donation, feel free to grab a Tara Supporter Headphone Case for $25.  If you're not ready to buy, please help share our story with your family and friends.

<p>For years, we have been wearing swimsuits and board shorts that have been restricting and not flexible. As adventurers, we are always on the move and participating in activities that get us going! With that, we need apparel that can move with us, and not hold us back and make us uncomfortable during our journey. </p>

<p>If we don't reach our $1,500 goal, you will still get your suit. If we do, we will have sufficient funds to place our bulk order, and you will get your suit. So, basically in short terms if you place an order you will get your suit.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Hi, my name is Carolyn, and my boyfriend Dave is kind of a crazy inventor type. One day he walked into the kitchen holding a homemade purse. I knew it did something, so I asked him ""Okay, so what does it do?""</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>He said ""It protects women and unborn babies from cell phone radiation!""</p>
<p>I have to admit that I didn't know much about cell phone radiation, so I did some research, and here's some of what I found:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">*Studies at Yale and UCLA showed that fetal exposure to radiation could cause lifetime hyperactivity and other neurological and emotional effects.</i><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<ul><li><i><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">*According to a Danish study, children exposed to mobile phones while in the womb are 30 percent more likely to have ADHD by age 7 than children who were not exposed to mobile phones while in the womb.</i><br/></i></li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">*Women who used handsets two or three times per day while pregnant were 54 percent more likely to give birth to children who developed behavioral problems by the time they reached school age than women who did not use them. The risk of behavioral problems increased along with the mother's mobile phone use during pregnancy.</i></li></ul>
<i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><ul><li>
<i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">*Cell phone manufacturers, including Blackberry and Apple, say <b>consumers should keep devices away from the body</b> due to potential safety risks but these warnings often go unnoticed because they are featured in device manuals.</i><br/>
</li></ul></i><p></p>
<p>And it not just unborn babies who are at risk:</p>
<p><b>There are no published studies examining the effect of cell phone radiation on reproductive health in women</b>. </p>
<p>But, read what happens to <b>men</b>:<br/></p>
<p><i>""Men who carried a phone in a hip pocket or on the belt had 11 percent fewer mobile sperm than men who kept a phone elsewhere on the body (Kilgallon 2005).<br/>Men who carried a cell phone on the belt and used it intensively during a five-day test period had a 19 percent drop in highly motile sperm from their previous levels (Davoudi 2002).""</i><br/></p>
<p>Should women expose themselves to this radiation? If men's sperm are affected, what happens to our eggs?</p>
<p>After doing the research, I decided that it was important to give women a way to protect themselves, and their unborn babies. So, I'm starting a company called the Silver Lining Purse Company. We're going to make the purses that Dave designed, so women can have a practical and stylish way to block the radiation. These are the world's only purses designed to protect women and their unborn babies from cell phone radiation.</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>THE PURSE</b></p>
<p>The Silver Lining Purse is a radiation blocking purse. We use a special cloth liner made with real silver, that blocks over 99% of the cell phone radiation. </p>
<p>The purses are offered (as perks) in Basic Black (which would retail for $100.00) and Fancy Black, Mod Blue and Red Leatherette (all of which will retail for $120.00). (Getting a purse as a perk is much cheaper!)</p>
<p>(When we start the company, we'll eventually introduce even more colors and patterns, so, if you'd prefer some other color, consider our gift certificate perks)</p>
<p>How it works: The purse is the shield. It's designed to be worn right next to the belly, where it does the most good. When you look at the pictures, you'll notice a distinctive ""funnel shaped"" pocket. This pocket is specially designed so you can easily slide the phone in and out, and the phone will stay in the middle of the shielded area. The pocket comes with a magnetic snap to keep your phone secure inside.</p>
<p>Note: You have to keep your phone in the outside pocket for the shielding to work.</p>
<p>The purses are made of 1000 denier nylon (similar to cordura) with nylon straps. The pockets and side panels will be made of nylon or vinyl. The purses are fairly large, about 12"" tall and wide. There are two special round bottomed pockets inside, designed to make it easy to grab your keys, or small items like change.</p>

One day he walked into the kitchen holding a homemade purse. I knew it did something, so I asked him ""Okay, so what does it do?""

He said ""It protects women and unborn babies from cell phone radiation!""
I have to admit that I didn't know much about cell phone radiation, so I did some research, and here's some of what I found:


*Studies at Yale and UCLA showed that fetal exposure to radiation could cause lifetime hyperactivity and other neurological and emotional effects.



*According to a Danish study, children exposed to mobile phones while in the womb are 30 percent more likely to have ADHD by age 7 than children who were not exposed to mobile phones while in the womb.


*Women who used handsets two or three times per day while pregnant were 54 percent more likely to give birth to children who developed behavioral problems by the time they reached school age than women who did not use them. The risk of behavioral problems increased along with the mother's mobile phone use during pregnancy.

*Cell phone manufacturers, including Blackberry and Apple, say consumers should keep devices away from the body due to potential safety risks but these warnings often go unnoticed because they are featured in device manuals.

And it not just unborn babies who are at risk:
There are no published studies examining the effect of cell phone radiation on reproductive health in women. 
But, read what happens to men:
""Men who carried a phone in a hip pocket or on the belt had 11 percent fewer mobile sperm than men who kept a phone elsewhere on the body (Kilgallon 2005).Men who carried a cell phone on the belt and used it intensively during a five-day test period had a 19 percent drop in highly motile sperm from their previous levels (Davoudi 2002).""
Should women expose themselves to this radiation? If men's sperm are affected, what happens to our eggs?
After doing the research, I decided that it was important to give women a way to protect themselves, and their unborn babies. So, I'm starting a company called the Silver Lining Purse Company.

<p><b>What is this about?</b></p>
<p>It is amazing what 15 years of losing
can do to a fan base. I grew up in Baltimore rooting for the Birds and
when it came to baseball knew nothing but winning. I loved the Birds
and man did I love that Orange!!! They were our boys and represented
all I knew at the time. We were winners with a strong tradition. I want
to make apparel that represents our tradition and culture as fans of Baltimore
Baseball.<br/></p>

<span class=""notranslate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">The last time I lived in  Baltimore before
the turn around last year was the  1997 Wire to Wire Season
and after that..... the wheels feel off. Far less fans went to the
games and people started call our home names like Fenway South. We had
a generation of Baltimore fans that didn't know what it was to have a
winning season. 15 years of losing and
team in DC that weaken the fan base even more.<br/><br/><p> I lived in New York and Los Angeles during the 15
years of losing. During my time in LA I started making hand customized
baseball caps of vintage/defunct sport teams. New York and are baseball
cities with a huge baseball fan base. You
would always see Fan T-Shirts. Pretty much made by fans for fans kind
of thing ( the punk-rock-shirts of baseball ). Those shirts spoke to
me. I  noticed such shirts were part of the baseball culture,
unique to that city, and those fans. Inspired by this I started hand
screening t-shirts as well.Since moving back to Baltimore I have
immersed myself back into the Baltimore baseball culture. Going to the
yard and local bars I noticed the lack of passion / energy in most
Baltimore Baseball gear. Everything seemed to be licensed apparel from
bigger companies or freebie giveaways. That's fine, but I wanted
something more.</p>

It is amazing what 15 years of losing
can do to a fan base. I grew up in Baltimore rooting for the Birds and
when it came to baseball knew nothing but winning. I loved the Birds
and man did I love that Orange!!! They were our boys and represented
all I knew at the time. We were winners with a strong tradition. I want
to make apparel that represents our tradition and culture as fans of Baltimore
Baseball.








The last time I lived in  Baltimore before
the turn around last year was the  1997 Wire to Wire Season
and after that..... the wheels feel off. Far less fans went to the
games and people started call our home names like Fenway South. We had
a generation of Baltimore fans that didn't know what it was to have a
winning season. 15 years of losing and
team in DC that weaken the fan base even more. I lived in New York and Los Angeles during the 15
years of losing. During my time in LA I started making hand customized
baseball caps of vintage/defunct sport teams. New York and are baseball
cities with a huge baseball fan base. You
would always see Fan T-Shirts. Pretty much made by fans for fans kind
of thing ( the punk-rock-shirts of baseball ). Those shirts spoke to
me. I  noticed such shirts were part of the baseball culture,
unique to that city, and those fans. Inspired by this I started hand
screening t-shirts as well.Since moving back to Baltimore I have
immersed myself back into the Baltimore baseball culture. Going to the
yard and local bars I noticed the lack of passion / energy in most
Baltimore Baseball gear. Everything seemed to be licensed apparel from
bigger companies or freebie giveaways. That's fine, but I wanted
something more.









I will like to build a Black and Orange Army of like minded fans.
Baltimore fans that think of creative ways to support the boys. Fans
that wear black and orange at least 162 times out the year. Now that we
are playing winning baseball
again it is time to rebuild this fan base, keep Baltimore excited
about the team that represents us.





 


So if you feel that way I do, support
this project. You will receive gear that will present you as Baltimore
fan and part of an army that spreads the culture of Baltimore Baseball.
We will be devoted to support the boys WIN or LOSE!








If this project is successful I would like backers to send me pics wear there Perks as they watch us versus Boston on the 29th of September. Pics will be
posted on Blackandorange.org
for your comrades to see.


What will you do with the money?
With your help I can continue to make
Baltimore Baseball gear that will add to the excitement of the City.
Help us stand out even when we are not cheering at the top of our lungs
and
get us noticed as what we are.....Prideful Fans of Baltimore
Baseball. I want to expand the culture. I want us to be the team people
think of when they hear Black and Orange!  Black and
Orange.org  will be come the home of the Baltimore Baseball
Fanatic and the Black and Orange Army. Help me make this happen.
This campaign ends on September 9th which will give me enough time to get perks to my backers. I will have all perks to backers before the last game against Boston on the 29th of September.  Lets wear the perks on that day as proud fans of Baltimore Baseball. We are in exciting times! Let show this city and team all the support we can.

<p><strong>2.

<p>The chap on the left is me, Marc C. Close. I was a structural engineer but realised that 'race-to-the-bottom' fast fashion needed fixing. So I assembled a team of tailors, engineers and craftspeople and we created A Product Company.

<h2>What's the big deal about bespoke?</h2>
<p>Bespoke is the highest level of shirt making. It is derived from the saying ""to be spoken for,"" meaning the customer has complete control over the shirt.

This means you get a fit like none other, and you have complete control over how you want your shirt to be.</p>
<p>In a bespoke shirt you will never have sleeves too short, top buttons that can't be done up, baggy arms or excess fabric around the waist. The shirt length will be long enough to never untuck from your pants, or short enough to wear untucked - it's up to you. Anyone wearing a bespoke shirt looks freaking brilliant, because it fits and has a level of quality unlike anything you can find in store or off a naff tailoring website.</p>

We also need to invest in marketing materials such as a photo shoot, and produce samples of each custom option so you know what it looks like on a real person.</p>
<p>We also need you to tell us your thoughts about the shirts. Do you want us to add a penny collar as an option? Do you want the power to define exactly how big your collar is? How about colours? Whatever it is, we can probably do it, and if it's popular enough we can add it to the plans.</p>

The majority of them were extremely positive, saying how T-Holders improved their lives and that they basically cannot live without it anymore. However, we were even happier to receive some suggestions for improvements. Based on these, we have developed the S-Holder with these main improvements:Adjustable side straps: which will work perfectly with any length of shirtAdjustable side straps for different lengths of shirt

It will be totally free, thanks to our business partners. The package will be delivered to your home safely in just a few days. When the campaign is over, you will receive a survey in which you will provide us your delivery address, thigh measurement and the colour of your brand new S-Holder.Shipping planHOW TO MAKE THE THIGH MEASUREMENT CORRECTLY Our mission is to make high quality, custom made products. In case the S-Holder Kickstarter campaign is funded, we will ask you for your thigh measurement on the thickest part, that we can create an unique product for you! How to do it:1. Take flexible measuring tape and wrap it around your thigh on the thickest part, as it is shown in the video below.2. Remember that measurement, because you will have to provide it to use in the Survey, if we are funded.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p style="""">We are Abby Gleason and Cassie Kay Rusnak, founders of an online magazine project for the Pittsburgh, PA area that supports and features only local and independent businesses and designers. We are putting on a fashion show to celebrate our 1-year anniversary on March 31, 2012 and to raise funds for the next year. We are including boutiques in the city that we worked with this past year as a celebration of how far the magazine has come and of the continued support of local business.</p>
<p style="""">The event will include: donated food and drink by local restaurants; a fashion show featuring local models, Pittsburgh-based independent boutiques and designers; and will close with a crazy fun dance party provided by DJ Dario.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style="""">The show is going on whether or not we reach the whole goal, but the funding we receive here will take the show from homemade and small-scale, to something more professional, beautiful and it will make a bigger impression on the Pittsburgh fashion scene.  East End Fashion Magazine's mission is to become a non-profit organization that focuses solely on the local and independent cultural scene in Pittsburgh, PA. Our featured photo spreads, interviews, and reviews bring people and businesses into the limelight.  This fashion show celebrates the past year of businesses we supported and the fundraising and tickets sales from this event will enable the next year of EEFM to bring great ideas to fruition.</span></p>
<p><span style=""""><br/></span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span style="""">We will be selling tickets to the public as a source of income, but this will not be enough to cover our preparation expenses to make this first-of-its-kind event in Pittsburgh as awesome as it deserves to be!</span></p>
<p><span style="""">We are using a huge loft gallery space, The Space Upstairs, located in Construction Junction's 100-year old warehouse in the East End of Pittsburgh for the venue. This gives us a unique urban location with lots of industrial charm, but much work needs to be done to the Space to prepare it for its first fashion show. LOOM Exquisite Textiles in the Strip District is providing inspiring bursts of color and personality but we need funds to cover the cost of (potentially) building a runway, incorporating spring-inspired dÃ©cor with live plants, advertising, and fair compensation to our extremely hard-working team that includes a set designer, hair and makeup artists, models, DJ and other fantastic individuals who are donating their time and energy.</span></p>

<p>It was designed to be activated with just one hand. During mock attacks with our prototypes, we discovered the least effective place to wear a safety device is on your wrist as it restricts access when you need it most.

When working with law enforcement officials, we discovered that an unanticipated loud noise can serve as an effective deterrent in certain circumstances. Although the volume is louder than a garbage disposal, we’re confident that it can be engineered even louder.</span></p>
<p>We know there are occasions when the wearer doesn't want the attacker to know that the device has been triggered. So, we've also engineered SilentROAR<small>™</small>, a feature in which alert messages can be sent without the alarm being activated.</p>

<p>Research has found that empathy levels have declined by 40% in college students since the year 2000 (Konrath, O’Brian &amp; Hsing, 2011). Based on the sexual assault numbers from the top 29 Northeast college campuses from 2008-2013 (Rocheleau, 2014), sexual assaults have increased as shown - suggesting a correlation between lack of empathy and aggression.</p>

In addition to the jewelry, we are committed to getting to the root causes of these attacks. That’s why for every Athena device purchased, we are investing a percentage of proceeds into non-profits that are teaching young boys and young girls about empathy and healthy relationships. Programs like these have been shown to reduce violence in adulthood.</p>

<p>To make that a reality, we've partnered with <i>The One Love Foundation</i>. Ten percent of proceeds from this campaign will go towards raising awareness about the warning signs of abuse and helping end relationship violence.</p>
<p>In addition, we've teamed up with <i>Women Against Abuse</i> (WAA) to provide in-kind devices to women in need with our ""Give the Gift of Safety"" and ""One for One"" perks. WAA is one of the foremost domestic violence advocate and service providers in the country. This non-profit agency provides safe havens, transitional housing, aftercare services, and education to women experiencing intimate partner violence.

<p>Our company started when Yasmine spent six months solo-trekking across South America where she met many women (both locals and travelers) who had been victims of assault. Just one week after she returned to Philadelphia, a woman was out feeding her parking meter when she was grabbed from behind, dragged into an alley, severely beaten, and brutally raped. It was at that moment that Yasmine and co-founder Anthony made a commitment to leverage their skills, resources, and energy to make a difference. And it was at that moment <i>ROAR for Good</i> was born.</p>
<p>The stats are horrifying. One in four women on a college campus will be sexually assaulted. One in five women has been a victim of rape or attempted rape. This is unacceptable, and ROAR is focused on developing solutions to help make a difference. We want to redefine the status quo - and believe that it’s possible.</p>

<p>The unfortunate truth is that everyone knows someone who has been a victim of assault. Athena has been designed as a smart, stylish accessory that instantly calls for help and can't be used to harm the person wearing it. And we're not simply focused on selling products, we're dedicated to digging into the root causes of violence. Your support will enable us to complete our production activities - as well as to help diminish attacks against women. </p>
<p><u><b>Our goal is to raise $40,000 in 33 days. With these funds, we will:</b></u></p>

<p><b>User Research:</b> We began with numerous focus groups, market surveys, and interviews with self-defense experts to get a sense for what works, what doesn’t work, and what has the potential to truly move the needle with regard to safe methods for reducing assaults.</p>
<p><b>Jewelry Design:</b> We designed several iterations of jewelry styles that were small in size and lightweight. In addition, we're configuring the device to be modular so you can swap out the face with additional colors and styles in the future. We tested those designs with many women, iterated on feedback, and developed our Athena line of jewelry.</p>
<p><b>Hardware Prototyping:</b> In parallel with our jewelry design, we developed a printed circuit board containing the logic needed to emit a loud alarm and connect with a mobile phone for alerting loved ones with the wearer’s location. We’re using a Bluetooth low-energy chipset for our communication stack to maximize battery life, as well as pairing &amp; beaconing to achieve our desired functionality.</p>

<p><b>Software Development:</b> We wrote all the firmware for the circuit board and developed a version of the mobile application that allows users to enter their emergency contacts and configure their alert messages (for both alarm mode and silent mode). And we currently have functional prototypes that, when activated, sound an alarm and send text messages to emergency contacts.</p>
<p><b>Feature Additions:</b> We designed the jewelry to be modular so that as we come out with new designs and colors, the face of Athena can be snapped out and replaced with the new designs - allowing for maximum customization to meet the most particular fashionista.

<p>We have been working for more than a year developing ROAR and getting it ready for production. We know what the next steps are for manufacturing and fulfillment and have great partners ready to start. However, we know that before mass production begins, we may encounter some problems. We have plans to mitigate the risks and have enlisted great advisors that will also help.</p>
<p>We need to create the tooling to manufacture different parts of the product. This process is complex and requires time and money. Complications could potentially emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule. To tackle this risk, we've selected partners that can work closely with us through the whole process.</p>
<p>When we have the first few production samples produced we will need to ensure they meet our quality standards. We have factored in several months for this process, which may involve iterative edits and improvements until we’re happy with what we’re sending you. However, if these take longer than anticipated, we’ll let you know why - along with a revised timeline.</p>
<p>We will undoubtedly have surprises on our journey, but we trust that we have the team to overcome all challenges, as we’ve done so far. Our goal is to make the best possible product for you and deliver it on time.</p>

</div></div>","Buy Athena Today on Indiegogo MarketplaceWe've shipped all pre-orders! If you have not received your order, please email us at help@roarforgood.com.We built Athena to help save lives. Athena is a simple device with a big mission - protect women from physical assaults at the touch of a button. By working with superstar technologists, self-defense gurus, and police / public-safety officers - we’ve engineered Athena so it acts as a deterrent by helping ward off an attack and instantly calling for help. When activated, it emits a loud alarm and sends text messages to loved ones with the wearer’s location.Women should not need to alter their lifestyle, modify their behavior, or carry self-defense devices to protect themselves. Our goal is to help create a society where that is a reality. In the meantime, we are committed to helping make a difference. Athena is not just a product, it's part of a movement to ROAR for Good. For each device sold, a portion of proceeds is invested in educational programs that have been shown to increase empathy and decrease violence.   
We’ve partnered with expert designers to create jewelry that is sleek, stylish, and can be as discreet as you want it to be. 




 




Athena will be available in 3 colors to choose from - Antique Silver, Timeless Black, and Rose Gold. 


We made Athena to be small and light - it's about the size of a half-dollar and an ounce in weight. 

Over the last 16 months, we've performed exhaustive research and conducted numerous focus groups and user testing to ensure Athena will be easy to use in panic situations without being accidentally triggered.

It was designed to be activated with just one hand. During mock attacks with our prototypes, we discovered the least effective place to wear a safety device is on your wrist as it restricts access when you need it most. As such, Athena was designed to be worn on on various locations on your body to provide you easy access.
 

 

Athena was built with the goal of getting you help when you need it most. When working with law enforcement officials, we discovered that an unanticipated loud noise can serve as an effective deterrent in certain circumstances. Although the volume is louder than a garbage disposal, we’re confident that it can be engineered even louder.
We know there are occasions when the wearer doesn't want the attacker to know that the device has been triggered. So, we've also engineered SilentROAR™, a feature in which alert messages can be sent without the alarm being activated.
 
We talked to thousands of women and these modes were determined based on their personal experiences. Here are the scenarios they shared for which mode they would use when: 

*Source: Noise Sources and Their Effects - Purdue University. Link: https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training...



Upon downloading the ROAR mobile app, users will be prompted to create an account and add their emergency contacts.
The application will be turned on automatically as soon as the wearer presses the activation button on Athena. Your contacts do not need the application installed - they will receive text messages with your location. 






 

Research has found that empathy levels have declined by 40% in college students since the year 2000 (Konrath, O’Brian & Hsing, 2011). Based on the sexual assault numbers from the top 29 Northeast college campuses from 2008-2013 (Rocheleau, 2014), sexual assaults have increased as shown - suggesting a correlation between lack of empathy and aggression.
As a social-mission certified B-corp, we don’t want to just put a bandaid on the problem. In addition to the jewelry, we are committed to getting to the root causes of these attacks. That’s why for every Athena device purchased, we are investing a percentage of proceeds into non-profits that are teaching young boys and young girls about empathy and healthy relationships. Programs like these have been shown to reduce violence in adulthood.

To make that a reality, we've partnered with The One Love Foundation. Ten percent of proceeds from this campaign will go towards raising awareness about the warning signs of abuse and helping end relationship violence.
In addition, we've teamed up with Women Against Abuse (WAA) to provide in-kind devices to women in need with our ""Give the Gift of Safety"" and ""One for One"" perks. WAA is one of the foremost domestic violence advocate and service providers in the country. This non-profit agency provides safe havens, transitional housing, aftercare services, and education to women experiencing intimate partner violence. Their mission, which aligns harmoniously with ROAR's, is to end violence through advocacy and community education.

Our company started when Yasmine spent six months solo-trekking across South America where she met many women (both locals and travelers) who had been victims of assault. Just one week after she returned to Philadelphia, a woman was out feeding her parking meter when she was grabbed from behind, dragged into an alley, severely beaten, and brutally raped. It was at that moment that Yasmine and co-founder Anthony made a commitment to leverage their skills, resources, and energy to make a difference. And it was at that moment ROAR for Good was born.
The stats are horrifying. One in four women on a college campus will be sexually assaulted. One in five women has been a victim of rape or attempted rape. This is unacceptable, and ROAR is focused on developing solutions to help make a difference. We want to redefine the status quo - and believe that it’s possible.


ROAR is founded by serial entrepreneurs who have successfully built and sold companies in the past. ROAR for Good is not just the company name, it embodies our team’s passion.

Complications could potentially emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule. To tackle this risk, we've selected partners that can work closely with us through the whole process.
When we have the first few production samples produced we will need to ensure they meet our quality standards. We have factored in several months for this process, which may involve iterative edits and improvements until we’re happy with what we’re sending you. However, if these take longer than anticipated, we’ll let you know why - along with a revised timeline.
We will undoubtedly have surprises on our journey, but we trust that we have the team to overcome all challenges, as we’ve done so far. Our goal is to make the best possible product for you and deliver it on time.
Thank you for your support - this couldn't happen without you! We hope you join us as we revolutionize safety and empower women everywhere.",44.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Hi I am Kristina Benshoff and I am the designer of Provocation. It is a contemporary clothing brand founded, funded, and single-handedly owned and operated by me. Any funds obtained through Indiegogo will be used to create sustainable digitally printed fabrics for the official launch of my 2014 Spring Collection in September at New York Fashion Week.</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I plan to showcase my new 2014 Collection, "" Blow-up"". Using recent technology, I have designed garments inspired by Modernism in 60's fashion and art. The architecture of the clothing has a graphic and futuristic attitude. I will create my own prints inspired by the MOD movement. My digital textiles will be blown up and abstracted into pixels and polka dots, translating it into a new direction.</p>
</div>
<p>Provocation by Kristina Benshoff is an edgy high end fashion brand with sustainable ideals and a minimalist attitude. My designs are deeply rooted in digital print. Unlike conventional textile manufacturing, digital printing entails very little waste of fabric, ink, water or electricity. My clothing uses eco-friendly, water-based pigment inks on natural organic fiber textiles. No additional chemicals are used in the printing or preparation process. The future of fashion focuses on the process of learning more about where our clothing comes from, what it takes to make and how far it travels to market. It is important to see the larger picture of our garments true life cycle and it's environmental impact.</p>
<p>I will be working with local fabric manufactures, photographers, models and local printing companies which in turn, help support the local economy. When you buy from an independent, locally owned business  it significantly strengthens the economic base of the community.</p>
<p>This collection is designed and ready to put into production. I need your help to get my garments on the NYC Runway.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Sabina Stanne. I'm originally from Romania, and now live in Vancouver, Canada. My interest in fashion goes back as far as I can remember, but my real journey started in 2008 when I left my home in Europe, travelling on my own to North America to pursue my fashion design education. After several years of school and attempting to define myself as a designer, the company has recently started to take shape with my first collection. When creating, I think of a woman’s defining attributes: her softness, her strength, her compassion, her body language. My aim is to offer high-quality, detail-oriented garments, using fabrics such as silk satins, chiffons, and laces sourced from Italy and Turkey.</p>
<p>Based on the feedback and encouragement I've received so far, I'd like to be able to continue with a second collection, Spring/Summer 2014. As a young entrepreneur, I face lots of challenges in finding the financial resources for creating a new collection and making my work known. This is just one of them and I would be extremely happy to be able to share my work with the world. Each piece of each collection tells a story and I put lots of love into everything I create.</p>
<p>Also, I believe that luxury can be animal cruelty-free and you'll never find leather or fur used in my work. My infinite love and true compassion for animals is well known by everyone around me. I would love to be able to help abandoned and abused animals from everywhere, but as a start I would like to donate 10% of all the funds received to animal organizations such as “Help Labus” (<a href=""http://www.help-labus.ro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.help-labus.ro</a>), “Robi” (<a href=""http://www.4animals.ro/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.4animals.ro/en/</a>) and Rolda (<a href=""http://www.rolda.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rolda.org</a>) from my home country. The street animals (dogs in particular) are still a big problem in some European countries and need our voices heard to make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The costs involved in creating a high-end collection are substantial, but as a new designer I had to work with very little to bring my first collection to life. Though I am happy with what I accomplished, the garments weren't a true representation of what I had envisioned. With this second collection I would like to get closer to that goal of having my ideas become a reality. This starts with the fabrics, which are the largest part of the overall cost. Beyond this, your contributions will go towards creating the patterns and sewing the first prototypes, creating the tags and packaging, lookbooks (catalogues), plus a launch/media event with a fashion show of the new collection.</p>
<p>While I wish I could thank every contributor in person, I'm offering perks from high-resolution photos and signed illustrations, to an invite to my Spring/Summer 2014 launch event in Vancouver with a spa package and lunch together. In addition to these, the animal organizations I mentioned will receive 10% of everything you contribute. All the details about your donation will be provided at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I would like to serve as an example of a high-end fashion designer that doesn't use animal-derived components in their work. We can all look glamourous and beautiful without having to make others suffer. Additionally, I only work with manufacturers that believe in fair employment practices and working environments. Moreover, this particular project means a lot to me because we can all contribute to helping abandoned, sick and abused animals. I would like to make the situation of street dogs known to the world and continue to offer part of my sales to other animal-related charities around the globe in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I understand that not all of you are able to help financially, but that's ok. I thank you for taking your time to view my campaign and I'd be extremely grateful if you can pass the message on to others. There are tools that you can use to help me get the word out, like copying and pasting the URL onto your Facebook page, email or any other social media.</p>
<p>For more information about my first collection, please visit my website <a href=""http://www.sabinastanne.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sabinastanne.com</a>. You can also ""like"" my professional Facebook page at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/SabinaStanne"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/SabinaStanne</a>.</p>
<p>A big impact starts with small changes, so I hope to have as many of you involved in this as possible! I thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart, as well as on behalf of the charities I'm working with and the animals that you'll be able to help!</p>

We can all look glamourous and beautiful without having to make others suffer. Additionally, I only work with manufacturers that believe in fair employment practices and working environments. Moreover, this particular project means a lot to me because we can all contribute to helping abandoned, sick and abused animals. I would like to make the situation of street dogs known to the world and continue to offer part of my sales to other animal-related charities around the globe in the future.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that not all of you are able to help financially, but that's ok. I thank you for taking your time to view my campaign and I'd be extremely grateful if you can pass the message on to others. There are tools that you can use to help me get the word out, like copying and pasting the URL onto your Facebook page, email or any other social media.
For more information about my first collection, please visit my website www.sabinastanne.com. You can also ""like"" my professional Facebook page at www.facebook.com/SabinaStanne.
A big impact starts with small changes, so I hope to have as many of you involved in this as possible! I thank each and every one of you from the bottom of my heart, as well as on behalf of the charities I'm working with and the animals that you'll be able to help!

<p>Your support
goes directly into launching Wind Over Water and creating the initial
collection of necklaces. Why is this so important in South Africa? When
statisticians rate countries according to their level of inequality, the US
rates as #39. South Africa rates #2. While all countries have their obstacles
to overcome, doing so on the individual level often becomes even more
difficult--especially for women. Nelson Mandela once said of South Africa: <i><span>""I pay tribute to the mothers and wives and sisters of our
nation. You are the rock-hard foundation of our struggle. Apartheid has
inflicted more pain on you than on anyone else.”</span></i> Almost 20

women are provided access to safe income generation, and encouraged to pursue
continuing education, we believe individuals, like you, can play a part in a
different history being written. </p>

That is where Off The Grid Collection was born, <i>out of a need to bring more amazing travel clothes to the </i></span><i>adventurous<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> souls that roam our beautiful earth. </span></i></p><p></p><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Campaign</h3><p></p><p>We have finished our designs for our complete 2015 ""launch"" collection. We are ready to share our designs with the world, but we need your support to move our designs from drawings on paper to wearable items. As you can imagine, designing a complete clothing line not only takes a lot of time, creativity, long nights and inspiration - but there are also many costs involved. In order to bring Off The Grid Collection to you and fellow travelers, we need your support to invest in our collection today! Don't worry, you'll get amazing rewards for doing so! Here are the awesome rewards that we are giving away.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/504714/files/20140413060329-photo.JPG?1397394209"" src="""" style=""""/></p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">All rewards will be brilliantly packaged in ""usable"" and recycled materials- you'll see what we mean when you get your package!</span><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><b></b></h3><p></p><h3><b>Rewards!</b></h3><p>Feel free to give us a shout if you have any questions about the rewards!

Of course we need much more than this to keep the project running and growing, but this is enough to cover our costs to get our first pieces created, and to get some of our fellow travelers wearing our collection! By creating a community of folks like YOU who are willing to support our project, it helps create momentum to get our collection in stores around the world. This campaign will give us the opportunity to have a full collection ""in-hand"" that we can promote at trade-shows, and bring to different boutiques and stores that may be interested in carrying our line. After we complete this </span>campaign<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, our goal will be to bring our full </span>collection<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> to potential stores and boutiques in order to get our collection out into the world on a larger scale. The more funds we raise, the more products we can bring to you! </span><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p>The funds will specifically go towards:</p><p></p><ol>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Fabrics </b>- We searched high and low for the best fabrics that would suit our vision for our collection, as well as the overall goal of making our products ""travel-friendly"". We will be using <b>handloom</b> fabrics from Sri Lanka (made with fine Indian cotton with <b>no electricity</b> used in the handloom process. Each piece of fabric is one of a kind with a lot of character). Our high quality <b>canvas</b> is 100% <b>waterproof</b>, a must for travelers! Our women's scarves are made from a <b>fine silk</b> and cotton handloom fabric that retains the </span>luxury<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> of silk while still being soft and easy to wear and wash. We are using only the <b>best linen</b>, that has been <b>pre-washed</b> for an extra soft finish and ready to wear. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Materials </b>- More than fabrics, we are also embellishing our products with lovely details that truly make our designs stand out. We found a wonderful leather-substitute for our bags, so that you can sport our bags around the world and be </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">eco/animal-friendly</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. The ""faux leather"" is made of acrylic, and no animals were harmed in the making! Our women's poncho, aka </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Campout, </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">features a beautifully cut </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">gem finishing</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> that is cut in such a way that it still retains it's natural beauty. The funds of the campaign will also go towards </span>additional<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> costs such as yarn for stitching, buttons, lining, zippers, clasps, elastics, embroidery, dying, packaging and labels. </span>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Labor</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> - Most importantly, we have created a team of brilliant merchandizers, pattern makers and seamstresses in Sri Lanka that we believe can truly take our </span>designs<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and bring them to life. Our goal is to make sure that they are </span>fully<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> compensated for their invaluable contribution to this collection. To read more about the garments industry in Sri Lanka please visit <a href=""http://www.garmentswithoutguilt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.garmentswithoutguilt.com/</a></span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Other costs</b> - There are so many other things that go into making a collection, such as maintaining our website, getting high quality photos for our pieces and our web presence, creating promotional materials such as ""lookbooks"" for potential buyers- this is where the rest of the funds will go towards in order to promote Off The Grid Collection, so we can supply you with awesome travel essentials year after year!</li>

Throughout our journey we will involve you in the design and production process, from initial ideas to choosing final prints- we want to create something that you feel was designed exactly for YOU. Join our mailing list and facebook page for all the fun!<br/><br/><b>Inspired</b> | Each season of our collection is inspired from our travels. We talk to locals, we drink tea in road side stalls, we take local buses and eat with our hands. It is the people we meet and the sights that we see during these experiences that we remember most fondly. Each collection will be inspired from a different country around the world, and each piece tells a story. That story is printed on the inside of the garment - because we want these stories to live on, to be told and shared. <br/><br/><b>Friendly</b> | We like friendly. Off The Grid is not just a clothing line, but our aim is to create a community of fellow curious travelers, creatives, and friendly people alike. We will create a community where people can share their travel stories, share their favorite spots and connect with other travelers in their area. We want everyone to be friends. <br/><br/><b>Sustainable</b> | In this day and age, we believe that we have the technology to make clothing that lasts. Whether you are hand washing our t-shirt in a bucket in Belize, or machine washing after a night out at the corner pub, our aim is to create clothing that makes it through your adventures. We also love animals, and use eco/animal-friendly leather. <br/><br/>We hope that you will take Off The Grid Collection on your next adventure. </p><p></p><h3>More About the Team!</h3>Alex Zanin is a clothing designer from Italy.

<p></p><p></p></div>","Off The Grid Collection is a clothing collection for the wanderlust. We make travel-friendly, fashionable pieces that you must take on your next adventure.escape | wander | ask questions | be curious | do something that scares you | get lost | collect stories | laugh often | lounge | be a yogi | be helpful | get away | listen | love | If any of these words are your motto or tune, our collection is for you. We are traveling the world, talking to beautiful souls and researching how we can bring you sustainable, fashionable travel clothing. We are
launching this Indiegogo campaign to raise the funds to create our first full
collection. We need your help to make our collection a reality. In exchange, we are offering YOU the opportunity to
get pieces from our 2015 before the rest of the world, including limited edition items. You can choose from any
of the pieces in our collection, and we will make them specifically for you and
deliver them to your doorstep before these pieces hit stores. Your contributions
will help make this collection come ALIVE! Thank you in advance for your amazing support! For more good stuff, visit our website: www.theoffthegridcollection.com.*Our Signature T-shirts above, released via web in January, are now 85% sold out! (please visit our website to order this t-shirt directly!)BackgroundThe idea for Off The Grid Collection came to us when we were in Bali at a surf camp. It was a reunion between friends from all over the world. We shared stories, adventures and a lot of laughs. As we were talking about our travels, our ""secret"" spots and favorite travel places, we all realized that we have a few ""key"" items in our suitcase that we never travel without; but these items were worn out or could be designed much better. That is where Off The Grid Collection was born, out of a need to bring more amazing travel clothes to the adventurous souls that roam our beautiful earth. The CampaignWe have finished our designs for our complete 2015 ""launch"" collection. We are ready to share our designs with the world, but we need your support to move our designs from drawings on paper to wearable items. As you can imagine, designing a complete clothing line not only takes a lot of time, creativity, long nights and inspiration - but there are also many costs involved. In order to bring Off The Grid Collection to you and fellow travelers, we need your support to invest in our collection today! Don't worry, you'll get amazing rewards for doing so! Here are the awesome rewards that we are giving away.All rewards will be brilliantly packaged in ""usable"" and recycled materials- you'll see what we mean when you get your package!Rewards!Feel free to give us a shout if you have any questions about the rewards! Note that some of our rewards are very limited in number because we are in the sample production-phase, which means each item is handmade, they are not mass produced, so each item gets the love and attention it deserves:) All rewards are made to order in sizes small, medium, large and extra large. We've also included the shipping costs for our rewards claimed in the US. Not from the USA? No problem! Just throw in a couple extra bucks to help us cover the cost of getting these items to you. We would love to have you wearing Off The Grid wherever you are!* We hope to have your products shipped out to you in Fall 2014, before the 2015 season begins!*Eco/animal-friendly leather is a leather substitute (made of acrylic) that we have decided to use instead of ""real leather"".

Of course we need much more than this to keep the project running and growing, but this is enough to cover our costs to get our first pieces created, and to get some of our fellow travelers wearing our collection! By creating a community of folks like YOU who are willing to support our project, it helps create momentum to get our collection in stores around the world. This campaign will give us the opportunity to have a full collection ""in-hand"" that we can promote at trade-shows, and bring to different boutiques and stores that may be interested in carrying our line. After we complete this campaign, our goal will be to bring our full collection to potential stores and boutiques in order to get our collection out into the world on a larger scale. The more funds we raise, the more products we can bring to you! The funds will specifically go towards:

Fabrics - We searched high and low for the best fabrics that would suit our vision for our collection, as well as the overall goal of making our products ""travel-friendly"". We will be using handloom fabrics from Sri Lanka (made with fine Indian cotton with no electricity used in the handloom process. Each piece of fabric is one of a kind with a lot of character). Our high quality canvas is 100% waterproof, a must for travelers! Our women's scarves are made from a fine silk and cotton handloom fabric that retains the luxury of silk while still being soft and easy to wear and wash. We are using only the best linen, that has been pre-washed for an extra soft finish and ready to wear. 


Materials - More than fabrics, we are also embellishing our products with lovely details that truly make our designs stand out. We found a wonderful leather-substitute for our bags, so that you can sport our bags around the world and be eco/animal-friendly. The ""faux leather"" is made of acrylic, and no animals were harmed in the making! Our women's poncho, aka The Campout, features a beautifully cut gem finishing that is cut in such a way that it still retains it's natural beauty. The funds of the campaign will also go towards additional costs such as yarn for stitching, buttons, lining, zippers, clasps, elastics, embroidery, dying, packaging and labels. 


Labor - Most importantly, we have created a team of brilliant merchandizers, pattern makers and seamstresses in Sri Lanka that we believe can truly take our designs and bring them to life. Our goal is to make sure that they are fully compensated for their invaluable contribution to this collection. To read more about the garments industry in Sri Lanka please visit http://www.garmentswithoutguilt.com/


Other costs - There are so many other things that go into making a collection, such as maintaining our website, getting high quality photos for our pieces and our web presence, creating promotional materials such as ""lookbooks"" for potential buyers- this is where the rest of the funds will go towards in order to promote Off The Grid Collection, so we can supply you with awesome travel essentials year after year!
Why Off The Grid?Off The Grid Collection is interactive, inspired, friendly and sustainable.Interactive | Our clothing collection is for YOU, and we mean it! Throughout our journey we will involve you in the design and production process, from initial ideas to choosing final prints- we want to create something that you feel was designed exactly for YOU. Join our mailing list and facebook page for all the fun!Inspired | Each season of our collection is inspired from our travels. We talk to locals, we drink tea in road side stalls, we take local buses and eat with our hands. It is the people we meet and the sights that we see during these experiences that we remember most fondly. Each collection will be inspired from a different country around the world, and each piece tells a story. That story is printed on the inside of the garment - because we want these stories to live on, to be told and shared. Friendly | We like friendly. Off The Grid is not just a clothing line, but our aim is to create a community of fellow curious travelers, creatives, and friendly people alike. We will create a community where people can share their travel stories, share their favorite spots and connect with other travelers in their area. We want everyone to be friends. Sustainable | In this day and age, we believe that we have the technology to make clothing that lasts. Whether you are hand washing our t-shirt in a bucket in Belize, or machine washing after a night out at the corner pub, our aim is to create clothing that makes it through your adventures. We also love animals, and use eco/animal-friendly leather. We hope that you will take Off The Grid Collection on your next adventure. More About the Team!Alex Zanin is a clothing designer from Italy.

</h3> <p>My name is Amae Love, I'm designer, singer and entreprenuer. I have been designing and sewing clothing since I was a teenager, and producing it for a decade with the same team. I LOVE being creative and having my creativity fuel my income! My clothing business fuels my career as a musical artist.<br/><br/>I have a wonderful production team, and I'm so excited to be creating new designs, this time with my Beloved partner, Tulku, who is a very successful community leader. Tulku produces 2 amazing music festivals, Enchanted Forest and ForeverEverLand. Look out for both of them in 2015!<br/>His participation is making my businesses all the more yummy, effective, and organized. Together, we are poised for our greatest success yet!<br/> As we speak, we are here in Bali creating Menswear, Women's clothing, leather belts and harnesses, silver and gold peacock feather jewelry, Epic silver and gold rings, septum rings and more. </p>
<p>Our new clothing designs for 2015 include: Men's lightweight hoodies, yoga/lounge pants, shorts, fitted stretch jeans, a double breasted stretch vest, and a convertible collar canvas vest. For women, there is a cropped hoody, reversible miniskirt, 2 new short dresses and a long dress, a full length vest with snaps, bubble pants, a tunic T-shirt, leggings, and more. <br/>Note: WE ARE ONLY HERE until April 10... so If what you want is a customized item, let us know ASAP so we can order it now. The sooner you order, the sooner we can get it to you.<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>One of the biggest challenges in doing a production with no outside funding is coming up with a large chunk of cash all at once.  With this campaign, we've figured out a way to help you help us...and we have SO much to offer in return!  <br/><p>Through this campaign we can offer you the best possible deals on our clothing, and customized options because we will be running this campaign during our design &amp; production process.  We wont be offering these benefits to anyone but our campaign supporters...that's YOU!</p>
<p>I have a few successful crowdfunding campaigns under my belt: One for a
 music video, one for my upcoming album ""REAL"", and another Pre-order campaign for my 
last clothing production. Crowdfunding is still the best way I know to bring visibility
 to your projects, invite participation and get the support you need.  There is no better way for us to get the word out about what we are 
doing, raise the funds we need for production AND give you the best deal possible. <br/>Crowdfunding is where it's 
AT, baby!!  :)</p>
<h3>No matter which perk you select, you may choose  any of the designs. No need to decide no<b>w! <br/></b>

<p>With 125+ products already up in the store, we can't list every product as a perk.<br/>To simplify things for us and offer the most flexibility to YOU in our perks, We've set up the campaign for you to buy credits with us. (Although I have provided *suggestions* for what you can get in each category, you don't have to follow them!) The more you spend, the bigger your discount, and you don't 
have to decide what you want until it's time to fulfill your order (in 
about 2 months- just in time for summer!) If you end up wanting something that costs MORE than the credit selected, no worries! You can simply send us the rest of the money by the time your items are ready to ship. You will STILL be getting first dibs through your contribution! Your credit will cover the shipping cost unless otherwise noted. <br/>If you know what you want already, and we have it in stock, we can fulfill your pre-orders RIGHT AWAY when you use PayPal.<br/>Instant Gratification, baby!<br/></p>
<p> Our high level of customer service will cater to you and insure your satisfaction with your final products! Having made our production possible, You will be our first priority. We allow you *infinite* flexibility with your credit. You may exchange sizes or items if needed. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. <br/>Our business needs these pre-orders to thrive! <br/>Quite simply, it is how we are going to pay for our production.</p>

goal. By no means is our goal an accurate representation of what it will
 cost to produce this line. We have already paid all our own travel,

<h3><span>WHY WE CREATED CLASSI</span></h3>Not so long ago, smartwatches were supposed to be the next big thing. However, we thought these devices were impersonal. They were pieces of technology, not pieces of art like traditional classic watches. Don’t get us wrong, we love technology, but we didn’t think that smartwatches should replace all classic watches. We asked ourselves a question: what if you could have both, a classic watch and a smartwatch? Since then, we’ve been on a journey to combine the best of technology with the best of the watch industry. We’re excited to finally introduce you to Classi, the product of years of hard work.

<p></p>
<h1><b>FAQ</b></h1>
<div>
<b></b><p><span><b></b></span></p>
</div>
<p><span><b>What makes Classi different?</b></span></p>
<p>Classi is a leather smart strap for classic watches. We’ve embedded the best of wearable electronics into a regular leather watchstrap that you can fit to your favourite traditional timepiece. Unlike other companies, which make smartwatches that look like classic watches, Classi gives you the power to make your own watch smart.</p>
<p>Classi can be fitted to any traditional timepiece and gives it the same features as most wearables, including activity tracking, notifications via vibrations, calorie counting and more.. We want to give people the best of both worlds by allowing them to keep the watch they love but also allow them to enjoy the best of technology.</p>
<p>The way we have embedded technology into a classic watchband is unique and patented (<a href=""http://bit.ly/maintoolpatent"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">US 9,292,008</a>). In addition to no compromise on design, our customers preserve their brand's culture, heritage and sentimental values since our electronics blend into the leather material until they quasi-disappear.</p>
<p><b>What does it do?</b></p>
<p>Classi not also combines the best of technology and design but also:</p>
<p>1) Measures footsteps + calories burned (pedometer)</p>
<p>2) Alerts smartly through discrete vibrations that can be customized</p>
<p>3) Communicates with iOS and Android apps</p>
<p>4) Uses a hidden button to reject phone calls and trigger emergency alerts</p>
<p>5) Can be customized with different modes based on your needs and situation</p>
<p>6) Has a 7+ day battery life </p>
<p><b>How does Classi work?</b></p>
<p>Classi can interact with Android and iOS smartphones via Bluetooth. With Classi, you can store your health data in real time to check your progress and personalize your watch strap vibration for each kind of notification that matters in your life.</p>
<p>Classi uses cutting-edge technology to provide users with the best experience: flex-rigid Printed Board Circuits (PCB), batteries with flexible connections, tiny vibration motors and magnetic charging technology.</p>
<p><b>How does Classi interact with my smartphone?</b></p>
<p>Classi is a completely discreet solution so you keep your style while being connected. It connects to your mobile phone via Bluetooth and works together with our iOS and Android mobile app.</p>
<p>Classi requires you to download the free MainTool app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (to be released early 2017).</p>
<p>Classi is compatible with iOS and Android. It requires:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>iPhone 4S or newer</p></li>
<li><p>iPod Touch 5th generation or newer</p></li>
<li><p>iPad 3 or newer</p></li>
<li><p>iPad Mini 1st generation or newer</p></li>
<li><p>iPad Air 1st generation or newer</p></li>
<li><p>Android devices equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 and running Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) or later.</p></li>
</ul>
<b><br/></b><p><b>How does the emergency button work?</b></p>
<p>When you are in a dangerous situation, you can press the emergency button on your Classi strap. This will send an SMS to the emergency contact that you have pre-set on the MainTool app.</p>
<p><b>Can I customize the notifications for calls, WhatsApp, Facebook, SMS, emails, etc.?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Classi allows you to customize your strap vibrations for each kind of notification that matters to you. This includesphone calls,  WhatsApp messages,  Facebook messages, emails and SMS messages. You decide the notifications you want to receive and the type of vibration for each of them.</p>
<p><b>Why should I be an early adopter? What advantages do I get?</b></p>
<p>Early adopters are the key initial supporters that will help us bring this project to life and spread the word. To thank you for being our special early adopters and supporters, you get:</p>
<p>1) The Classi strap for just $99</p>
<p>2) A 2-year full warranty and after sales service</p>
<p>3) You will receive your strap before we sell it anywhere else!</p>
<p><b>How much will Classi cost after the campaign?</b></p>
<p>The retail price for Classi will be $149. We want to show gratitude to our supporters during the campaign and that is why they get such a big discount compared to the post-campaign price.</p>
<p><b>At what stage is MainTool with Classi?</b></p>
<p>Classi’s hardware, design and fully functional prototypes are done. They have been ready and exhaustively tested since June 2016. We are currently raising funds to start the industrial process and begin mass production. We also want to get our product validated by you.</p>
<p>After our first batch of market-ready products are shipped, we will sell our products via our website and through selected partners.</p>
<p><b>What OS does Classi support?</b></p>
<p>Classi is compatible with iOS and Android.</p>
<p><b>Which apps and devices are compatible with Classi?</b></p>
<p>Classi can beintegrated with all of your favorite healthcare apps.  Current integrations are based on smartphone notifications, but deeper integrations with productivity and risk prevention are planned.</p>
<p><b>Where can the Classi strap be shipped? How much does it cost?</b></p>
<p>Classi can be shipped worldwide. We collect a small fee in order to support our shipping costs.</p>
<p>We charge $10 per shipment for Europe and $20 per shipment for the rest of the world.</p>
<p><b>When will Classi be delivered?</b></p>
<p>We expect to ship out all the Classi straps by April 2017.</p>
<p><b>How will my order be shipped?</b></p>
<p>We will be shipping all the orders with the most suitable premium courier which will vary between countries. All shipments will have tracking numbers which will be emailed to you once the delivery has been shipped.</p>
<p><b>How long does the battery last?</b></p>
<p>Classi lasts 7+ days with a frequent use.</p>
<p><b>Is Classi waterproof?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Classi has an IP64 rating and  is “splashproof”, which means that it can resist the usual scenarios like temporarily being under the rain or washing your hands.</p>
<p>However, bear in mind that Classi is made of leather which may be damaged if it comes in  contact with water, so we do not recommend swimming or diving with it.</p>
<p><b>Do you offer warranty and after sales service?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Our final product will have a full 2-year full warranty to all our Indiegogo backers and we will have an after sales service available.</p>
<p>The warranty does not cover damage caused by accident or misuse of the strap while in the possession of a consumer not caused by a defect in material or workmanship.</p>
<p><b>How do I charge my Classi?</b></p>

<p><b>Classi est il imperméable à l'eau ?</b></p>
<p>Oui. Classi est IP64 et est ""splashproof"", ce qui signifie qu'il peut résister aux scénarios habituels comme étant temporairement sous la pluie ou le lavage des mains.</p>
<p>Cependant, gardez à l'esprit que Classi est fait de cuir qui peut être endommagée si elle entre en contact avec l'eau, donc nous ne recommandons pas de nager ou plonger avec elle.</p>

<p><b>Comment puis-je charger mon Classi?</b></p>
<p>Classi est livré avec un petit chargeur magnétique que vous pouvez brancher sur le port USB pour charger votre bracelet.</p>
<p><b>Dans quelles couleurs Classi est disponible?</b></p>
<p>Classi est disponible en trois versions différentes: cuir de veau brun et noir, et un modèle haut de gamme avec un vrai alligator noir.</p>
<p><b>Avez-vous un brevet pour cette technologie?</b></p>
<p>Oui. La façon dont nous avons intégré la technologie dans un bracelet classique est unique et breveté depuis Février 2016 (<a href=""http://bit.ly/maintoolpatent"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">US 9,292,008</a>).</p>
<p><b>Puis-je remplacer la batterie?</b></p>
<p>Non, mais les batteries peuvent durer pendant environ 5 ans avec une utilisation intensive de sorte que vous ne devez pas vous inquiéter à ce sujet.</p>

<h3>¿POR QUÉ CREAMOS CLASSI?</h3>
<p></p>
<span>Hace poco tiempo, se creía que los smartwatches serían la próxima gran tendencia. Sin embargo, pensamos que son objetos muy impersonales y que serían piezas de tecnología en lugar de ser verdaderas obras de arte como los relojes clásicos. No nos malinterpreten, amamos la tecnología pero no creíamos que los smartwatches deberían reemplazar a los relojes tradicionales y por eso nos preguntamos: “y qué tal si pudiésemos combinar ambos, un reloj clásico y uno inteligente?”. Por esa razón, decidimos iniciar un viaje para combinar la mejor tecnología disponible con lo mejor de la industria relojera sin comprometer su hermoso diseño. Finalmente, estamos orgullosos de presentar Classi, el producto de un arduo trabajo que nos ha llevado años.</span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470657743/indiegogo_hekzhs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

THE STORY BEHIND

THE LUNATICS BEHIND MAINTOOL


Our vision at MainTool is to seamlessly embed technology into people's everyday lives. It isn’t a mystery though. What makes us special is our team.






Through our first product, Classi, we wish to give everyone the opportunity to make their regular watch smart.


Based in Paris, France and Madrid, Spain, our team probably consists of one of the oddest sets of people you would ever expect to find furiously and yet coherently working together towards the same quest. But we all share delusional passion and endless energy in striving to connect a daily accessory that is already on over a billion peoples' wrists.
MANAGEMENT TEAM

                                                   
                
                     

BEST ENGINEERING TEAM



We have the best IoT engineering team in the field. Together, our team has created more than 20 connected devices. They are led by:              

                 

WHY WE CREATED CLASSINot so long ago, smartwatches were supposed to be the next big thing. However, we thought these devices were impersonal. They were pieces of technology, not pieces of art like traditional classic watches. Don’t get us wrong, we love technology, but we didn’t think that smartwatches should replace all classic watches. We asked ourselves a question: what if you could have both, a classic watch and a smartwatch? Since then, we’ve been on a journey to combine the best of technology with the best of the watch industry. We’re excited to finally introduce you to Classi, the product of years of hard work.





MAINTOOL IN THE PRESS

RISK & CHALLENGES

Now, it is our mission to fulfill our promises and give our backers an awesome product and an even better after sales service!

Unlike other companies, which make smartwatches that look like classic watches, Classi gives you the power to make your own watch smart.
Classi can be fitted to any traditional timepiece and gives it the same features as most wearables, including activity tracking, notifications via vibrations, calorie counting and more.. We want to give people the best of both worlds by allowing them to keep the watch they love but also allow them to enjoy the best of technology.
The way we have embedded technology into a classic watchband is unique and patented (US 9,292,008). In addition to no compromise on design, our customers preserve their brand's culture, heritage and sentimental values since our electronics blend into the leather material until they quasi-disappear.
What does it do?
Classi not also combines the best of technology and design but also:
1) Measures footsteps + calories burned (pedometer)
2) Alerts smartly through discrete vibrations that can be customized
3) Communicates with iOS and Android apps
4) Uses a hidden button to reject phone calls and trigger emergency alerts
5) Can be customized with different modes based on your needs and situation
6) Has a 7+ day battery life 
How does Classi work?
Classi can interact with Android and iOS smartphones via Bluetooth. With Classi, you can store your health data in real time to check your progress and personalize your watch strap vibration for each kind of notification that matters in your life.
Classi uses cutting-edge technology to provide users with the best experience: flex-rigid Printed Board Circuits (PCB), batteries with flexible connections, tiny vibration motors and magnetic charging technology.
How does Classi interact with my smartphone?
Classi is a completely discreet solution so you keep your style while being connected. It connects to your mobile phone via Bluetooth and works together with our iOS and Android mobile app.
Classi requires you to download the free MainTool app from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store (to be released early 2017).
Classi is compatible with iOS and Android. It requires:

iPhone 4S or newer
iPod Touch 5th generation or newer
iPad 3 or newer
iPad Mini 1st generation or newer
iPad Air 1st generation or newer
Android devices equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 and running Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) or later.

How does the emergency button work?
When you are in a dangerous situation, you can press the emergency button on your Classi strap. This will send an SMS to the emergency contact that you have pre-set on the MainTool app.
Can I customize the notifications for calls, WhatsApp, Facebook, SMS, emails, etc.?
Yes. Classi allows you to customize your strap vibrations for each kind of notification that matters to you. This includesphone calls,  WhatsApp messages,  Facebook messages, emails and SMS messages. You decide the notifications you want to receive and the type of vibration for each of them.
Why should I be an early adopter? What advantages do I get?
Early adopters are the key initial supporters that will help us bring this project to life and spread the word. To thank you for being our special early adopters and supporters, you get:
1) The Classi strap for just $99
2) A 2-year full warranty and after sales service
3) You will receive your strap before we sell it anywhere else!
How much will Classi cost after the campaign?
The retail price for Classi will be $149. We want to show gratitude to our supporters during the campaign and that is why they get such a big discount compared to the post-campaign price.
At what stage is MainTool with Classi?
Classi’s hardware, design and fully functional prototypes are done. They have been ready and exhaustively tested since June 2016. We are currently raising funds to start the industrial process and begin mass production. We also want to get our product validated by you.
After our first batch of market-ready products are shipped, we will sell our products via our website and through selected partners.
What OS does Classi support?
Classi is compatible with iOS and Android.
Which apps and devices are compatible with Classi?
Classi can beintegrated with all of your favorite healthcare apps.  Current integrations are based on smartphone notifications, but deeper integrations with productivity and risk prevention are planned.
Where can the Classi strap be shipped? How much does it cost?
Classi can be shipped worldwide. We collect a small fee in order to support our shipping costs.
We charge $10 per shipment for Europe and $20 per shipment for the rest of the world.
When will Classi be delivered?
We expect to ship out all the Classi straps by April 2017.
How will my order be shipped?
We will be shipping all the orders with the most suitable premium courier which will vary between countries. All shipments will have tracking numbers which will be emailed to you once the delivery has been shipped.
How long does the battery last?
Classi lasts 7+ days with a frequent use.
Is Classi waterproof?
Yes. Classi has an IP64 rating and  is “splashproof”, which means that it can resist the usual scenarios like temporarily being under the rain or washing your hands.
However, bear in mind that Classi is made of leather which may be damaged if it comes in  contact with water, so we do not recommend swimming or diving with it.
Do you offer warranty and after sales service?
Yes. Our final product will have a full 2-year full warranty to all our Indiegogo backers and we will have an after sales service available.
The warranty does not cover damage caused by accident or misuse of the strap while in the possession of a consumer not caused by a defect in material or workmanship.
How do I charge my Classi?
Classi comes with a small magnetic charger that you can plug into the port to charge your strap.
In which colors is Classi available?
Classi comes in three different versions: brown and black calf leather, and a premium model with real black alligator.
Do you have a patent for this technology?
Yes. The way we have embedded technology into a classic strap is unique and patented as of February 2016 (US 9,292,008).
Can I replace the battery?
No, but the batteries can work for more than 5 years with heavy use so you do not have to worry about it.

<p>HUDs (Heads up Displays) have potential. We know this. But for now they are awkward looking, a barrier to social interactions, and a huge drain on battery and processing power. Pivothead devices are designed for content creation - not content consumption.  Our focus has to be on the one thing that makes Pivothead SMART<b>™ </b>so practical and useful for everyday life - superior imaging quality.</p><p>
While we prefer pairing our glasses with a smartwatch or
smartphone for instant preview or playback functionality - we also understand the power of notifications.<br/></p><p>And so we created our <b>LED Lightguide </b>as an alternative to a full-on HUD.</p>
<p>Here's what the Light Guide will support at launch:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""color: rgb(203, 38, 46);""><span style=""color: #222;""><b>Eyewear Status</b> | check power, memory, and operation status</span></li>
<li style=""color: rgb(203, 38, 46);""><span style=""color: #222;""><b>Capture Status</b> | know when your device is recording or streaming</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few things we hope the community creates with access to the LED Lightguide and the Pivothead SDK.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""color: rgb(203, 38, 46);""><span style=""color: #222;""><b>Notifications</b> | get sms, facebook, twitter, or other app notifications</span></li>
<li style=""color: rgb(203, 38, 46);""><span style=""color: #222;""><b>Assisted Sight</b> | applications for the visually impaired</span></li>
<li style=""color: rgb(203, 38, 46);""><span style=""color: #222;""><b>Location Based Alerts</b> | turn-by-turn directions with Google Maps (example)</span></li>
<li style=""color: rgb(203, 38, 46);""><span style=""color: #222;""><b>LARP Games</b> | find out when someone nearby is trying to assassinate you</span></li>
<li style=""color: rgb(203, 38, 46);""><span style=""color: #222;""><b>Surprise Us</b>  | please - developers - show us what you can do</span></li>

HUDs (Heads up Displays) have potential. We know this. But for now they are awkward looking, a barrier to social interactions, and a huge drain on battery and processing power. Pivothead devices are designed for content creation - not content consumption.  Our focus has to be on the one thing that makes Pivothead SMART™ so practical and useful for everyday life - superior imaging quality.
While we prefer pairing our glasses with a smartwatch or
smartphone for instant preview or playback functionality - we also understand the power of notifications.And so we created our LED Lightguide as an alternative to a full-on HUD.
Here's what the Light Guide will support at launch:

Eyewear Status | check power, memory, and operation status
Capture Status | know when your device is recording or streaming

Here are a few things we hope the community creates with access to the LED Lightguide and the Pivothead SDK.

Notifications | get sms, facebook, twitter, or other app notifications
Assisted Sight | applications for the visually impaired
Location Based Alerts | turn-by-turn directions with Google Maps (example)
LARP Games | find out when someone nearby is trying to assassinate you
Surprise Us  | please - developers - show us what you can do

Pivothead SmartMods™ (patent-pending) are modular accessories that add advanced features and functionality to any pair of Pivothead SMART™ Eyewear. SmartMods™ were designed to address a few key challenges of any smart glass technology - the continual need for more memory, power, and connectivity. There are currently three SmartMods™ in development for the first generation of Pivothead SMART™ - the Fuel Mod, the Live Mod, and the Air Mod - each with unique features and functionality.


Fuel Mod | continuously recharge their eyewear 

Live Mod | stream Full HD (1080p) video

With Pivothead's Live Streaming, adjustable image and capture settings, LED notifications, and wireless connectivity the potential applications for integration with 3rd party software and hardware are endless. 
Are you a developer? Have an idea of how you could use Pivotheads to make something amazing? Create your own SMART™ App with the Pivothead SDK. 

To help get the ideas flowing we have put together a few examples of how developers might use the Pivothead SDK to develop apps to enhance daily living for Pivothead Smart users.Have a question about developing for Pivothead SMART™? Send us an email at indiedeveloper@pivothead.com or visit our indiegogo.support.com.

 Let's face it - Smartwatches are hot.  And there are few (if none) hotter than the Omate® TrueSmart™ Android-OS smartwatch.  Our dev team has been working closely with Omate® to develop a smartwatch app to tightly integrate Pivothead SMART™- and it's sweet.  Whether you use an Omate, Kreyos, or any other open smartwatch, the Pivothead SDK is going to give you the ability to integrate your Pivothead SMART™ Eyewear to your smartwatch.  What for?  How about remote control?  How about live preview of the image or video you want to take?  How about mind-control?  Ok - that last one was a bit over the top. But you get the point.  It's awesome.




Pivothead's patent-pending dual-gesture control can use a combination of optical or motion-triggered events - from a combination of devices - to do something awesome. Pivothead SMART™ is the first product designed to include this technology - and we can't wait to see what developers can do with it in its final form.In the meantime, access to the Pivothead LIVE RTSP, NTSC or PAL stream or the Pivothead AIR Mod's Android OS will allow developers to use a combination of video analytics and gyro/accelerometer access to create never-before-seen gesture-driven applications.




Pivothead LIVE - a standard unfiltered 1080p RTSP, NTSC or PAL stream - will enable a wide variety of Assisted Site & Object recognition applications an ecosystem in which they can flourish.




Lost in a new city and can't orient yourself? Use Pivothead LIVE to recognize street or mass transit signs, integrate with Google or Apple Maps, and use Pivothead SMART™'s LED Lightguide to get back on the right track.




QR & Bar Codes are everywhere - from airports to grocery stores to airplane factory floors. The potential for on-the-go recognition of quick-reference standardized marks extends from personal to professional - and we can't wait to see how Pivothead SMART™ developers will be used with this technology.

<li>Nous sommes trois résidents d'un foyer à Neuchâtel (Suisse) pour adultes en difficultés financières. Début janvier 2013, nous, à savoir Stéphanie Gétaz - David Rodriguez et Lucas Stoller avons réunis nos compétences dans le but de sortir de l'aide sociale et de créer notre entreprise, une nouvelle marque horlogère RESILIENCE-WATCH. Depuis une année, nous avons vécu une histoire incroyable, hors norme qui casse toutes les idées préconçues que les pauvres sont justes bons à rien foutre de leurs journées. Nous, NOUS EN VOULONS et NOUS AVONS LE CRAN d'aller au bout de ce projet: avoir notre propre entreprise, notre propre emploi et sortir de ce système social défaillant.  <a href=""http://www.resilience-watch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.resilience-watch.com</a>  // <a href=""http://resiliencewatch.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://resiliencewatch.wordpress.com</a>
</li>
<li>Pour aider d'autres personnes ayant le même but, nous avons créé l'association ANB: A NEW BEGINNING <a href=""http://associationanewbeginning.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://associationanewbeginning.wordpress.com/</a>
</li>
<li>La première montre que nous voulons produire est la montre 'Destiny' . C'est une montre qui a déjà son destin tracé et fera l'objet d'un projet d'une encore plus grande envergure.</li>
<li>Chaque personne qui nous aide, de quelque manière qui soit, par un don ou en parlant de ce projet, nous aide de manière significative ! Et chaque personne compte à nos yeux. Voilà pourquoi on a besoin de vous !</li>
</ul><p>Et vous, voulez-vous justement contribuer à ce projet ?</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>////////////////////////////////////////</p><h3>THE RESILIENCE-WATCH PROJECT </h3><p>Who are we and why have we chosen Indiegogo?</p><ul>
<li>We
 are three residents of a hostel for adults in financial difficulties in
 Neuchâtel (Switzerland). In the beginning of the month of January 2013,
 we, meaning Stéphanie 
Gétaz - David Rodriguez and Lucas Stoller have united our competences to
 get out of the social aid services and to create our own enterprise, a 
new watch brand RESILIENCE-WATCH. Ever since this last past year, we 
have lived an incredible story, extraordinary that goes beyond the idea 
that poor people are just good at not doing a damn thing of their days. 
Us, WE WANT and WE HAVE THE GUTS to go through with our project: have 
our own entreprise, our own work place and get out of this failiant 
social system.  <a href=""http://www.resilience-watch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.resilience-watch.com</a>
  // <a href=""http://resiliencewatch.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://resiliencewatch.wordpress.com</a>
</li>
<li>To help other people that have the same goal, we have created the association ANB: A NEW 
BEGINNING <a href=""http://associationanewbeginning.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://associationanewbeginning.wordpress.com/</a>
</li>
<li>The first 
watch that we want to produce is the watch 'Destiny'. It's a watch that 
already has its destiny traced and will serve to an even greater 
project.</li>
<li>Each person that helps us, in any manner, with a donation or by talking about this project can help us significiently! And each person counts in our eyes. That is why we need you!<br/>
</li>
</ul><h3></h3><p>And you, would you precisely like to contribute to this project?<br/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/524454/files/20140421232529-montre_transparent_et_carr__plus_petit.jpeg?1398147929"" src="""" style=""width: 410.858px; height: 600px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>CONTRIBUEZ AU DÉVELOPPEMENT DE LA MONTRE  !</h3><p>Plus en détails :</p><ul>
<li>180'000 Euros. </li>
<li>La somme est importante, mais les enjeux le sont aussi. Dans le milieu horloger, les frais de conception et de production grimpent à une vitesse vertigineuse ! </li>
<li>D'une part, nous sommes une start-up d'une petite entreprise. Donc les fournisseurs ne nous font pas de cadeaux à notre stade. </li>
<li>D'autre part, il y a énormément d'étapes dans la conception et la réalisation d'une montre que David Rodriguez, après ses longues années d'expérience dans l'horlogerie, connait chaque étape: les premières esquisses, le concept, les dessins, les dessins informatiques, les rendus, la reprise des dessins par un designer horloger, les protections des images et du produit, la conception et la réalisation de la montre en 3 dimensions, les plans destinés à l'usinage, le premier prototype en cire, les retouches, les dessins techniques, le mouvement Valjoux 7750, les devis de constructions après avoir obtenu les côtes, l'usinage, le boîtier, les revenus galvano-plastie (bains chimiques de revêtement pour les couleurs et les traitements de surface), le fond gravé, la lunette, le cadran, les aiguilles, le traitement de superluminova, les visses, le verre en saphir, le bracelet, le fermoir en boucle déployante, l'assemblage et les réglages, les tests d'étanchéité, les contrôles de marches, les certificats et les garanties, les manuels d'utilisation, l'écrin. Voilà les principales étapes pour la montre 'Destiny'.</li>
<li>Et vous dans l'histoire? </li>
<li>Vous pouvez nous aider ! Au travers de vos dons, vous faites avancer ce projet ! En contre-partie, nous vous témoignons notre gratitude et vous remercie en vous faisant parvenir un cadeau correspondant à la tranche de dons qui nous sera parvenu dès la réception du versement !</li>
<li>Dans tous les cas, nous avancerons. Mais votre aide est précieuse à nos yeux et vous auriez le mérite de contribuer à un projet qui a de l'avenir !</li>
</ul><p>////////////////////////////////////////</p><p></p><h3>TAKE PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WATCH!</h3><p>In details:</p><ul>
<li>180'000 Euros. </li>
<li>The
 amount is important, but the stakes are too. In the watch industry, the
 costs of design and production are rising at breakneck speed!</li>
<li>On the one hand, we are a start-up a small business. So providers do not make prices for us at our stage.</li>
<li>On
 the other hand, there are a lot of steps in the design and 
implementation of a watch and David Rodriguez, after his long years of 
experience in watchmaking, knows every step : the first sketches, 
concept, drawings, computer drawings, renderings, drawings improved by a
 watchdesigner, copyrights of the images and the product, designing and 
construction of the watch in 3 dimensions, plans for machining the first
 wax prototype, retouching, technical drawings, the Valjoux 7750 
movement, estimations for the construction after obtaining the right 
dimentions, machining, the case, galvano - plasty income (chemical 
plating baths for colors and surface treatments) the engraved base, 
bezel, dial, hands, superluminova treatment, the screws, the sapphire 
glass, bracelet, deployant buccle clasp , assemblement and adjustments, 
leak testing, the control steps, certificates and guarantees, user 
manuals, and settings. These are the main steps for the 'Destiny' watch.</li>
<li>How about you in this story? </li>
<li>You
 can help us! Through your donations, you enable this project to 
advance! In counter part, we express our gratitude and thank you by 
sending you a gift corresponding to the portion of donations that we 
will recieve upon receipt of payment!</li>
<li>In any cases, we are going
 foward. But your help is valuable to us and you could have the merit of
 contributing to a project that has a future!</li>

<li>Pendant longtemps, on nous a dit: ""Quand tu es à l'aide sociale, tu ne peux rien faire."" En attendant, on a créé une start-up au nom de RESILIENCE-WATCH et une association au nom de A NEW BEGINNING (ANB). DONC pour nous on se dit: ""Pourquoi pas aller au bout de ce projet et fonder notre entreprise, tout en aidant les autres qui veulent s'en sortir eux aussi ! ?"" On vous le demande... Souhaitez vous nous aider et contribuer pour que RESILIENCE-WATCH se pérennise en concrétisant la montre 'Destiny' ?</li>
<li>David Rodriguez, de part son aventure avec l'entreprise BNB avait été sélectionné pour participer à la Confrérie Horlogère en 2009 et avait été le premier à fabriquer la montre de la collection Résilience. D'où le nom qui nous a inspiré pour fonder RESILIENCE-WATCH.</li>
<li>Cette montre, 'Destiny', est destinée à un projet de plus grande envergure et vous pourrez figurer parmi les personnes ayant permis à ce projet de se concrétiser ! Nous vous en serons infiniment reconnaissant !</li>
</ul><p>////////////////////////////////////////<br/></p><p></p><h3>EVERY ACTION COUNTS!</h3><p>Your contribution will make the difference:</p><ul>
<li>For
 a long time, we were told: ""When you're on welfare, you can't do 
anything."" In the meantime, we have created a start-up in the name of 
RESILIENCE-WATCH and an association on behalf of A NEW BEGINNING (ANB). 
SO we tell ourselves: ""Why not go forward with this project and build 
our business while helping others who want to get out social aid too?"" 
We ask you ... Would you help us and contribute so that RESILIENCE-WATCH
 can be sustained by concretizing the watch 'Destiny'?</li>
<li>David 
Rodriguez, through his adventure with the company BNB was selected to 
participate in the Confrérie Horlogère (watchmaking brotherhood) in 2009
 and was the first to manufacture a watch, the Resilience collection. 
Hence the name, which inspired us to found RESILIENCE-WATCH.</li>
<li>This
 watch, 'Destiny', is intended for a larger project and you can be among
 those who allowed this project to happen! We will be infinitely 
grateful!</li>

Nous sommes trois résidents d'un foyer à Neuchâtel (Suisse) pour adultes en difficultés financières. Début janvier 2013, nous, à savoir Stéphanie Gétaz - David Rodriguez et Lucas Stoller avons réunis nos compétences dans le but de sortir de l'aide sociale et de créer notre entreprise, une nouvelle marque horlogère RESILIENCE-WATCH. Depuis une année, nous avons vécu une histoire incroyable, hors norme qui casse toutes les idées préconçues que les pauvres sont justes bons à rien foutre de leurs journées. Nous, NOUS EN VOULONS et NOUS AVONS LE CRAN d'aller au bout de ce projet: avoir notre propre entreprise, notre propre emploi et sortir de ce système social défaillant.  http://www.resilience-watch.com  // http://resiliencewatch.wordpress.com

Pour aider d'autres personnes ayant le même but, nous avons créé l'association ANB: A NEW BEGINNING http://associationanewbeginning.wordpress.com/

La première montre que nous voulons produire est la montre 'Destiny' . C'est une montre qui a déjà son destin tracé et fera l'objet d'un projet d'une encore plus grande envergure.
Chaque personne qui nous aide, de quelque manière qui soit, par un don ou en parlant de ce projet, nous aide de manière significative ! Et chaque personne compte à nos yeux. Voilà pourquoi on a besoin de vous !
Et vous, voulez-vous justement contribuer à ce projet ?////////////////////////////////////////THE RESILIENCE-WATCH PROJECT Who are we and why have we chosen Indiegogo?
We
 are three residents of a hostel for adults in financial difficulties in
 Neuchâtel (Switzerland). In the beginning of the month of January 2013,
 we, meaning Stéphanie 
Gétaz - David Rodriguez and Lucas Stoller have united our competences to
 get out of the social aid services and to create our own enterprise, a 
new watch brand RESILIENCE-WATCH. Ever since this last past year, we 
have lived an incredible story, extraordinary that goes beyond the idea 
that poor people are just good at not doing a damn thing of their days. 
Us, WE WANT and WE HAVE THE GUTS to go through with our project: have 
our own entreprise, our own work place and get out of this failiant 
social system.  http://www.resilience-watch.com
  // http://resiliencewatch.wordpress.com

To help other people that have the same goal, we have created the association ANB: A NEW 
BEGINNING http://associationanewbeginning.wordpress.com/

The first 
watch that we want to produce is the watch 'Destiny'. It's a watch that 
already has its destiny traced and will serve to an even greater 
project.
Each person that helps us, in any manner, with a donation or by talking about this project can help us significiently! And each person counts in our eyes. That is why we need you!

And you, would you precisely like to contribute to this project?CONTRIBUEZ AU DÉVELOPPEMENT DE LA MONTRE  !Plus en détails :
180'000 Euros. 
La somme est importante, mais les enjeux le sont aussi. Dans le milieu horloger, les frais de conception et de production grimpent à une vitesse vertigineuse ! 
D'une part, nous sommes une start-up d'une petite entreprise. Donc les fournisseurs ne nous font pas de cadeaux à notre stade. 
D'autre part, il y a énormément d'étapes dans la conception et la réalisation d'une montre que David Rodriguez, après ses longues années d'expérience dans l'horlogerie, connait chaque étape: les premières esquisses, le concept, les dessins, les dessins informatiques, les rendus, la reprise des dessins par un designer horloger, les protections des images et du produit, la conception et la réalisation de la montre en 3 dimensions, les plans destinés à l'usinage, le premier prototype en cire, les retouches, les dessins techniques, le mouvement Valjoux 7750, les devis de constructions après avoir obtenu les côtes, l'usinage, le boîtier, les revenus galvano-plastie (bains chimiques de revêtement pour les couleurs et les traitements de surface), le fond gravé, la lunette, le cadran, les aiguilles, le traitement de superluminova, les visses, le verre en saphir, le bracelet, le fermoir en boucle déployante, l'assemblage et les réglages, les tests d'étanchéité, les contrôles de marches, les certificats et les garanties, les manuels d'utilisation, l'écrin. Voilà les principales étapes pour la montre 'Destiny'.
Et vous dans l'histoire? 
Vous pouvez nous aider ! Au travers de vos dons, vous faites avancer ce projet ! En contre-partie, nous vous témoignons notre gratitude et vous remercie en vous faisant parvenir un cadeau correspondant à la tranche de dons qui nous sera parvenu dès la réception du versement !
Dans tous les cas, nous avancerons. Mais votre aide est précieuse à nos yeux et vous auriez le mérite de contribuer à un projet qui a de l'avenir !
////////////////////////////////////////TAKE PART IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WATCH!In details:
180'000 Euros. 
The
 amount is important, but the stakes are too. In the watch industry, the
 costs of design and production are rising at breakneck speed!
On the one hand, we are a start-up a small business. So providers do not make prices for us at our stage.
On
 the other hand, there are a lot of steps in the design and 
implementation of a watch and David Rodriguez, after his long years of 
experience in watchmaking, knows every step : the first sketches, 
concept, drawings, computer drawings, renderings, drawings improved by a
 watchdesigner, copyrights of the images and the product, designing and 
construction of the watch in 3 dimensions, plans for machining the first
 wax prototype, retouching, technical drawings, the Valjoux 7750 
movement, estimations for the construction after obtaining the right 
dimentions, machining, the case, galvano - plasty income (chemical 
plating baths for colors and surface treatments) the engraved base, 
bezel, dial, hands, superluminova treatment, the screws, the sapphire 
glass, bracelet, deployant buccle clasp , assemblement and adjustments, 
leak testing, the control steps, certificates and guarantees, user 
manuals, and settings. These are the main steps for the 'Destiny' watch.
How about you in this story? 
You
 can help us! Through your donations, you enable this project to 
advance! In counter part, we express our gratitude and thank you by 
sending you a gift corresponding to the portion of donations that we 
will recieve upon receipt of payment!
In any cases, we are going
 foward. But your help is valuable to us and you could have the merit of
 contributing to a project that has a future!
CHAQUE GESTE COMPTE !Votre contribution va faire la différence :
Pendant longtemps, on nous a dit: ""Quand tu es à l'aide sociale, tu ne peux rien faire."" En attendant, on a créé une start-up au nom de RESILIENCE-WATCH et une association au nom de A NEW BEGINNING (ANB). DONC pour nous on se dit: ""Pourquoi pas aller au bout de ce projet et fonder notre entreprise, tout en aidant les autres qui veulent s'en sortir eux aussi ! ?"" On vous le demande... Souhaitez vous nous aider et contribuer pour que RESILIENCE-WATCH se pérennise en concrétisant la montre 'Destiny' ?
David Rodriguez, de part son aventure avec l'entreprise BNB avait été sélectionné pour participer à la Confrérie Horlogère en 2009 et avait été le premier à fabriquer la montre de la collection Résilience. D'où le nom qui nous a inspiré pour fonder RESILIENCE-WATCH.
Cette montre, 'Destiny', est destinée à un projet de plus grande envergure et vous pourrez figurer parmi les personnes ayant permis à ce projet de se concrétiser ! Nous vous en serons infiniment reconnaissant !
////////////////////////////////////////EVERY ACTION COUNTS!Your contribution will make the difference:
For
 a long time, we were told: ""When you're on welfare, you can't do 
anything."" In the meantime, we have created a start-up in the name of 
RESILIENCE-WATCH and an association on behalf of A NEW BEGINNING (ANB). 
SO we tell ourselves: ""Why not go forward with this project and build 
our business while helping others who want to get out social aid too?"" 
We ask you ... Would you help us and contribute so that RESILIENCE-WATCH
 can be sustained by concretizing the watch 'Destiny'?
David 
Rodriguez, through his adventure with the company BNB was selected to 
participate in the Confrérie Horlogère (watchmaking brotherhood) in 2009
 and was the first to manufacture a watch, the Resilience collection. 
Hence the name, which inspired us to found RESILIENCE-WATCH.
This
 watch, 'Destiny', is intended for a larger project and you can be among
 those who allowed this project to happen! We will be infinitely 
grateful!

<h1>Allocation of Funding</h1>
<p>When we reach the funding goal, we will
 be able to place a large manufacturing order for the Q-Tee Clutch.  We will immediately set aside the funds for manufacturing and 
shipping, with an added 20% margin for any unexpected costs.  The 
remaining funds will be used for future product development, building 
additional inventory, and launching our website. </p>
<p>If we reach 
our stretch goal of $40k, not only will we manufacture the Q-Tee Clutch, but we will also begin working to finalize the design, 
prototypes, and molds of a fold-flat bottle, which will allow parents to
 leave the diaper bag behind on even longer trips.  Follow us on 
Indiegogo for announcements and status of this future project.</p>

BRAND NEW INVENTION: Q-Tee ClutchNever before seen!  Exclusively here on Indiegogo! Makes a great gift!The Q-Tee Clutch was designed for quick trips, it has everything a parent needs to change a baby.  It also makes a great emergency diaper-change kit.  It is our dream and our mission to make every parent's life just a little bit easier.  Currently, we have the only ""all-in-one diaper clutch"" that can hold a spare change of clothes.  

Invented by parents of 3 small children,this design fits easily into:

Imagine the relief that parents feel when they are finally able to 
leave home without a giant cumbersome diaper bag.   By reducing the bulk, parents are freer and able to react to young children in parking lots. 


Traditional diaper bag....

Even on short trips to the store, parents of infants must bring a diaper, wipes, change of clothes, a big diaper-bag to carry it all, and more!  A traditional diaper bag can contain up to 4 pounds of material, even when it is empty! For generations, this 
feeling of ""freedom from the bag"" only came when the baby was old enough
 to stay clean, dry, and eat at predictable times.
Not any more. Today, exclusively on our Indiegogo campaign, we are introducing the first ""all-in-one"" diaper clutch.




The clutch also makes a great emergency kit for the car!

Currently, we have the only ""all-in-one diaper clutch"" that can hold a spare change of clothes.  Just fold and snap the clutch, add a diaper, wipes, and large Ziploc (for soiled clothes), and you are ready to go!


For longer trips, the Q-Tee Clutch is the perfect addition to existing diaper-bags.  This enables parents to quickly grab the clutch from the diaper bag when leaving the car, table, stroller, or shopping cart to change a diaper. Since the clutch has everything needed to change a diaper, the rest of the bulky diaper bag can be left behind.



How to Back Our Project


Are you ready to help make this dream a reality?
The clutch comes in multiple sizes and colors.  Contribute today!  After the project ends, we will send an e-mail requesting your 
specific color/design and size preferences.
Step 1: Choose Your Reward
Make your pledge! 
We appreciate every dollar contributed.  After the campaign ends, we will contact all of our supporters to present options for fabric and size. Please note: Shipping costs  to the USA are ALREADY included in the Perk costs!
                                               Early Bird Rewards:




Note: Due to minimum order quantities with manufacturers, the available colors/patterns will depend on the level of success of the Indiegogo campaign.  We do guarantee at least two color choices, with more being offered as the number of orders increases.  If we reach the stretch goal of $40,000, we will offer at least 5 color/pattern choices.  



                                               Elite Rewards:

Step 2: Share with Your Friends - PLEASE!
Even if you are not able to pledge, please share this project with your friends and family.  Spreading the word is essential to a successful campaign. Every person that views our project will bring us one step closer to making this dream a reality!


Allocation of Funding
When we reach the funding goal, we will
 be able to place a large manufacturing order for the Q-Tee Clutch.  We will immediately set aside the funds for manufacturing and 
shipping, with an added 20% margin for any unexpected costs.  The 
remaining funds will be used for future product development, building 
additional inventory, and launching our website. 
If we reach 
our stretch goal of $40k, not only will we manufacture the Q-Tee Clutch, but we will also begin working to finalize the design, 
prototypes, and molds of a fold-flat bottle, which will allow parents to
 leave the diaper bag behind on even longer trips.  Follow us on 
Indiegogo for announcements and status of this future project.

Q-Tee Clutch Project Schedule



In summary, we have a fully unique, developed, proven, and 
patented diaper-clutch that is ready for production.  We've aligned with
 a highly qualified manufacturer that has the ideal facilities and 
capabilities for production of the clutch. We are now ready to hit the 
'start' button on production and fulfillment.  With your help, we can 
get this product started and reduce the diaper-bag burden on every 
parent in America!

OUR COMMITMENT
We will fill every promise/reward, even if we have to make them with our own hands! 
We want to show our appreciation for those who support this project.  We have qualified proven manufacturing sources to reduce risks. We have already worked to tweak the design and ensure the products are of good quality and easily produced. We have done our homework and product testing to eliminate risk and ensure that your pledges are met with satisfaction!

It's based on open source projects (like BeagleBoard, Arduino, Reprap) and will be also </span>released<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> as open source once finished.</span></p><p>
</p><p>The T-Bone will come pre-programmed for <a href=""http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Mendel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reprap Mendel 3D Printer</a>. Best known in the <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_Mendel_(iteration_2)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Prusa Mendel</a> or <a href=""http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Prusa i3</a> variant. The Software will include low level
drivers, the printer application and a high level Web Interface for control.
Just connect your steppers, heaters and sensors, configure the software and you
are ready to print.</p>
<p></p><p>To join highest performance with flexibility and easy programming, we use a very powerful concept: Hard- and software abstraction layers! User interface, configuration, G-Code interpreter, and path planner are running on the BeagleBone. This makes it easy to use existing open source software components, using the existing toolchain on the Linux operating systems of the BeagleBone. Real-time communication with the BeagleBone is handled by a small microcontroller, placed on the T-Bone. The microcontroller is fully compatible with the Arduino toolchain, so everybody can easily modify it. Complex acceleration and velocity calculations for the stepper motors are done by dedicated motion controllers. These are dedicated hardware components, developed to get the maximum performance out of a given stepper motor without putting any workload to the host system.</p><p>
</p><p>The low level drivers for the motion controllers and realtime
applications are written with the Arduino IDE in C. The higher level
applications for G-Code analysis, motion control and web interface are written
in Python. There are no special hardware drivers involved. Most of the hardware
can be used on the built in Arduino or BeagleBone Black. All software will be
released as open source software on github.</p>
<p></p><p>Here are the main features of the basic board:</p><ul>
<li>5 stepper motor driver (run syncronized, 3 x up to 4 A, 2 x up to 1.5 A)<br/>
</li>
<li>10 inputs for end switches (two for each axis)<br/>
</li>
<li><b>Support for switch-less step detection (<a href=""http://youtu.be/kB22GvtcAO8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/kB22GvtcAO8</a>).</b></li>
<li>3 inputs for incremental encoders (3 axis supporting closed loop control)</li>
<li>3 inputs for thermistors <br/>
</li>
<li>1-wire interface for digital temp and other sensors<br/>
</li>
<li>2 high power outputs (for extruder and heatbed, up to 12 A)</li>
<li>1 mid power output (for fans, LEDs, ..., also expandable)</li>
<li>Power supply for BeagleBone (5 V, 1.2A)</li>
<li>Input voltage 12 - 24 V</li>
<li><b>Board is stackable to control several T-Bones with one BegaleBone</b></li>
</ul><p>For more detailed description of the hardware features see <a href=""http://www.tbone.cc/board/hardware-details/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> (to be continued...).<br/></p><p>But that's not all. We are planning to create some additional expansion boards with special features. Here are some of the feature we are planning:</p><ul>
<li>Support for rotary axis like driller, miller, ...</li>
<li>Support for laser cutters</li>
<li>External touch panel display</li>
<li>Support for other hardware plattforms</li>
</ul><p>
</p><p>And you can do even more! The
software is easily adaptable to most CNC applications. If you want to connect
your CNC mill you do not have to develop it from ground up, just adapt the
printing logic a bit.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/439029/files/20140317044307-Pinout-820x715.jpg?1395056587"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h3>What we need</h3><p>Our funding goal has a simple reason: Produce a first batch boards for reasonable cost.

<h1>The Story-</h1>
<p>Articulate began just over a year ago, when we set out to create a wallet that would simplify our lives.  We launched our first design on Kickstarter and thanks to the overwhelming support, we were successfully funded.  We fulfilled over 3,000 orders and since then have received feedback and suggestions for a better wallet.  Taking them into consideration we have come up with something truly unique and one of a kind.  </p>
<p>We wanted a wallet that was convenient to use, looked great, and was thin at the same time.  Money clips are a one solution to keeping it thin, but we found it very inconvenient folding your bills to put them away.  The standard bill-folds we found on the market were either too bulky, too cheap looking, or way over priced.  The Articulate Wallet 2.0 gives you everything you look for in the perfect wallet.  An ultra-thin minimalist design, convenient to use, and all at a very affordable price.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>What is RFID?</strong></p>
<p>Not familiar with RFID? RFID is the technology that allows an individual to simply wave their credit card to complete a purchase. Instead of the traditional swipe action that we are so accustomed to, people now have the ability to simply wave there card in front of a scanner which completes a transaction. </p>
<p><strong>Why is Articulate telling me about RFID?</strong></p>
<p>With every great technology advance there is always going to be someone who wants to break the system. Criminals with very minimal technical skills have created devices similar to the to the scanner which vendors such as grocery stores or use to complete purchases. With these makeshift scanners that the criminals make, they can easily steal your personal financial information. With this information they can make new credit cards based on your financial information. All the perpetrator needs to do is walk past an innocent civilian which then picks up the credit card signal embedded in the credit card.</p>
<p>With the Articulate Wallet 2.0, your information is better protected, including the card in the back pocket.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Though we can't guarantee 100% protection  due to different frequency signals in each card, our goal is to limit perpetrators  from gaining information access.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">  Feel more secure that all your personal information is protected in an ultra thin and stylish design.  </span></p>

We took all the feedback and suggestions we received from our backers and created an even better wallet. 
The Articulate Wallet 2.0 now uses an upgraded premium full grain imported Italian leather that looks and feels amazing.   We wanted a wallet that would compare to the inflated designer brand wallets.  Not only does it look and feel the same, it incorporates features that no other wallet has. 


The new design has six card slots with slanted corners to make for quick access.  It is truly one of a kind.  






The 2.0 is now 1/2in THINNER then the 1.0.  ONLY .35in!! This makes it as thin as an iPhone!  By using an upgraded leather, we were able to make one of the thinnest leather bill-folds on the market today.





Seamless, refined build quality. The edges of the wallet now wrap inside of the wallet. This makes for a professional, higher quality wallet.  



The lining on the back pocket wraps over itself. 


We added a special RFID blocking lining. You can now feel more secure that your personal information is better protected.Our goal is to help prevent against Identify theft. We embedded a material that is known to block the transmission of this type of signal. Though we can't guarantee 100% protection due to the variability of transmissions with RFID cards our goal is to limit perpetrators  from gaining information access.Other RFID blocking wallets on the market are boring/bulky and have nothing unique about them.   


We widened the wallet by 1/4in to hold your bills more easily.

<p>Art is a crucial part of companies like Knockaround and plays a significant role in our daily surroundings.  But unfortunately, we’re seeing funds, resources, and classes for art education in public schools rapidly disappear from the national landscape. That is why it is so important for us to do what we can and show young students the artistic career opportunities available to them in the future.</p>

<b>The winning design</b>.<br/>
</h2>
<p>With the help of ArtReach, our partnering non-profit organization, we visited three local San Diego elementary schools, and collected designs from over 250 fourth and fifth graders.  After much deliberation (there were lots of really great designs), we decided we couldn't pass up 5th grader Vanessa's Nacho design.  Great job, Vanessa!<br/></p>

<b>Trust Us.  We've done this before. </b><br/>
</h2>
<p>Working with young designers is not a new idea to Knockaround. In 2012, Knockaround held a design contest at a local elementary school. The 5th and 6th grade students designed their own pair of sunglasses and the Knockaround team selected a single pair to put into production.</p>
<p>Amongst the designs was a standout pair of ""Shark Attack"" glasses created by 6th grader Sebastian. The Shark Attack sunglasses were produced in a limited edition of 200 pairs, and all 200 pairs sold out in under an hour. $5 from every pair sold contributed to a $1,000 donation of new art supplies for Sebastian’s school.</p>
<p>Based on the success of the Shark Attacks, we knew we had to expand this program.  <br/></p>

<p>Once the campaign is complete, Knockaround will produce the winning Nacho sunglasses and ship them directly to everyone that supported the cause on <a href=""http://indiegogo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo.com</a>. <br/></p>
<p>We expect the Nacho sunglasses, and all of the other rewards, to ship by late Spring 2014... so everyone that contributes will have their sunglasses in time for summer!  </p>
<p>As an extra special reward, if you donate at the $100 level or above, we'll include a re-issued pair of the famous Shark Attack sunglasses from 2012.</p>

Knockaround is a sunglasses company based in San Diego, California.  We've been around since 2005.  Through the years we've worked with some amazing people and some amazing brands.  We've been featured on notable websites like InStyle.com and Hypebeast.com.  We've been mentioned in periodicals like Complex and GQ.  Celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Natalie Portman, and Ashton Kutcher wear our sunglasses.


This year, we decided to launch a new charitable program called Knockaround Class Acts.

Knockaround Class Acts aims to donate money, resources, and art supplies to local, underfunded elementary schools. 
Art is a crucial part of companies like Knockaround and plays a significant role in our daily surroundings.  But unfortunately, we’re seeing funds, resources, and classes for art education in public schools rapidly disappear from the national landscape. That is why it is so important for us to do what we can and show young students the artistic career opportunities available to them in the future.


The winning design.

With the help of ArtReach, our partnering non-profit organization, we visited three local San Diego elementary schools, and collected designs from over 250 fourth and fifth graders.  After much deliberation (there were lots of really great designs), we decided we couldn't pass up 5th grader Vanessa's Nacho design.  Great job, Vanessa!





Buy a Pair!  Here is who you'll be helping.
100% of the proceeds from this campaign will be donated.
Each of the three elementary schools that submitted designs will be awarded 15% of the funds to pay for new art supplies and art lessons.  A $1000 educational scholarship will be awarded to Vanessa for her outstanding design.  And the remaining money we raise will be donated to ArtReach, our partnering non-profit organization, which facilitates visual art education in underfunded elementary schools around San Diego.  Read more about ArtReach here.  




Trust Us.  We've done this before. 

Working with young designers is not a new idea to Knockaround. In 2012, Knockaround held a design contest at a local elementary school. The 5th and 6th grade students designed their own pair of sunglasses and the Knockaround team selected a single pair to put into production.
Amongst the designs was a standout pair of ""Shark Attack"" glasses created by 6th grader Sebastian. The Shark Attack sunglasses were produced in a limited edition of 200 pairs, and all 200 pairs sold out in under an hour. $5 from every pair sold contributed to a $1,000 donation of new art supplies for Sebastian’s school.
Based on the success of the Shark Attacks, we knew we had to expand this program.  



The details.
Once the campaign is complete, Knockaround will produce the winning Nacho sunglasses and ship them directly to everyone that supported the cause on Indiegogo.com. 
We expect the Nacho sunglasses, and all of the other rewards, to ship by late Spring 2014... so everyone that contributes will have their sunglasses in time for summer!  
As an extra special reward, if you donate at the $100 level or above, we'll include a re-issued pair of the famous Shark Attack sunglasses from 2012.




International Donations
Unfortunately, we are unable to ship perks internationally, however, international contributors can still donate to our campaign.

Help us spread the word!
Even if you're not in a position to contribute, you can still help us spread the word about Knockaround Class Acts by telling your friends about our campaign. Share this page using the share buttons above and help us maximize our donation!

Limited Perks
Throughout the campaign we will be adding limited offer perks. Like Knockaround, many of our collaborating partners have an affinity for art. A few of them have helped us create special donation perks which include past Limited Edition sunglasses:

<p><b><i>HOW DID THE IDEA START AND HOW WE CHOOSE INDIEGOGO?</i></b></p>
<p><i>Xfect/Perfect is an Italian project born between Milan and Rome in the last 4 years. Roberta was looking for a shapewear to fit in a new dress. The market only offered old fashion products (Bridget Jones like), very uncomfortable to wear (too tight) of with a very poor quality (the fabric would lose immediately any effectiveness). So, together with the Team, she created a new product to fill the quality gap in the market putting quality, effectiveness and comfort into one single apparel offering something new and affordable to every woman: a real breakthrough.</i></p>
<p><b><i>OBJECTIVES</i></b></p>
<p><i>Today xfect/Perfect offers a complete shapewear line that is sold in the best boutiques across Italy and in several European markets.</i></p>
<p><i>But we wanted to take it a step further: we want to create a complete shapewear clothing line xfect/Perfect Fashion for which we have already created some prototypes presented in our video.</i></p>
<p><i>We want to launch this new line on Idiegogo for all of you and to receive from you ideas, feedbacks, comments and, why not, also “digital high fives”.</i></p>
<p><i>For this new clothing line we choose to use a super high tech new material with unique characteristics: it does not crumple with the use, it can be easily cleaned with a damp cloth and, if used or placed in a suitcase it is perfect again in a second. It’s the ideal product for the active and working women who wants to be perfect from morning to evening.</i></p>

<p><i>From the development of new prototypes, with your help, we want to go on and produce the new line to offer women some more and jump start this new project. These are our objectives:</i></p>

<p>We wanted to create a time piece truly inspired by Simplicity x Carbon fiber - so we have spent the last 12 months creating a unique watch that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple &amp; Versatile</li>
<li>Minimalist Inspired</li>
<li>High Quality</li>
<li>Sleek &amp; Stylish</li>
<li>Affordable</li>

<p><b>Carbon </b>is designed to pay homage to the minimalist era of modern design. Free of distractions, the focus is truly in the form and simplicity of the crossover between a classic/modern sports dial - inspired by Carbon Fiber.</p>
<p><b>Carbon </b>offers both modern and classic styles combined with a hint of sophistication - with a clean 316L stainless steel bezel 45mm in diameter free of any embellishments to keep the focus on the dial. The dial uses minimal incremental markers for the index of time to help keep the face clean. With a unique Carbon fiber grained face, unified with the minimalist index approach - we believe that time can be measured simply.</p>
<p>We have incorporated an engraved rounded crown (3 o'clock position) with knobs (2 and 4 o'clock positions) to <b>drive </b>the chronograph features without taking the focus away from the face.</p>
<p>Powered by a Japanese Seiko 6-Hand chronograph engine, the beholder has access to the following, in the Sleekest form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Luminous hour/minute hands</li>
<li>Extended length Second hand</li>
<li>Stopwatch function Lap/reset functions</li>
<li>Milliseconds/Elapsed Seconds/Minutes dials</li>
<li>Contrasting Date window</li>
</ul>
<p>A Flat Sapphire crystal lens is then flush-mounted to the bezel to embrace the sized case and create a perfect look and feel on the wrist - not being too chunky, nor too flat - providing an increased sense of luxury and quality. The finished case is rated up to 5ATM water resistant for maximum durability.</p>
<p>We have added quick-release spring bars to our hand crafted Genuine Leather and Nato* styled straps for added Versatility. It means that you can change the strap in seconds, without the use of tools. Our Stainless Steel straps are designed to fit perfectly – so the use of the strap tool (included in the set) is required.</p>
<p>Each strap is coupled to the case with stainless steel 22mm-width lugs, combined with the case – it makes the perfect watch for any occasion - every time. With your help, we believe we can bring <b>Carbon </b>to life.</p>

We wanted to create a time piece truly inspired by Simplicity x Carbon fiber - so we have spent the last 12 months creating a unique watch that is:

Simple & Versatile
Minimalist Inspired
High Quality
Sleek & Stylish
Affordable





Carbon is designed to pay homage to the minimalist era of modern design. Free of distractions, the focus is truly in the form and simplicity of the crossover between a classic/modern sports dial - inspired by Carbon Fiber.
Carbon offers both modern and classic styles combined with a hint of sophistication - with a clean 316L stainless steel bezel 45mm in diameter free of any embellishments to keep the focus on the dial. The dial uses minimal incremental markers for the index of time to help keep the face clean. With a unique Carbon fiber grained face, unified with the minimalist index approach - we believe that time can be measured simply.
We have incorporated an engraved rounded crown (3 o'clock position) with knobs (2 and 4 o'clock positions) to drive the chronograph features without taking the focus away from the face.
Powered by a Japanese Seiko 6-Hand chronograph engine, the beholder has access to the following, in the Sleekest form:

Luminous hour/minute hands
Extended length Second hand
Stopwatch function Lap/reset functions
Milliseconds/Elapsed Seconds/Minutes dials
Contrasting Date window

A Flat Sapphire crystal lens is then flush-mounted to the bezel to embrace the sized case and create a perfect look and feel on the wrist - not being too chunky, nor too flat - providing an increased sense of luxury and quality. The finished case is rated up to 5ATM water resistant for maximum durability.
We have added quick-release spring bars to our hand crafted Genuine Leather and Nato* styled straps for added Versatility. It means that you can change the strap in seconds, without the use of tools. Our Stainless Steel straps are designed to fit perfectly – so the use of the strap tool (included in the set) is required.
Each strap is coupled to the case with stainless steel 22mm-width lugs, combined with the case – it makes the perfect watch for any occasion - every time. With your help, we believe we can bring Carbon to life.




After months of design adjustments and revisions - we had our design finalized and created prototypes with our manufacturers. The results were amazing - we were beyond belief, something so beautiful, so sleek - sophisticated had been born.



With Carbon, we not only wanted to design a watch that captured the essence of simplicity and carbon fiber – we wanted it to be versatile. With that in mind, we created a time piece that came with interchangeable straps as a set – along with a matching travel case. We have infused a combination of styles and fine-tuned a look to complete any style, every day, whatever you do - wherever you go.What’s included in every set*:






Being inspired by Versatility - we believe that you should be able to take your watches with you wherever you go. As a result, we have designed a matching Travel Wallet to help you carry not only your watches, but all your travel necessities too: A picture is worth a thousand words.


The travel case was designed to not only house the time pieces, but to enable the user to stay organized with travel documents whilst on the go! 
We have finalized the internals of the Rival Travel Case, here is how it looks on the inside! The internals boast the following features:


Left side: Travel Essentials
Inner is of Suede construction
Coin Zipper Pocket
Passport Large slot
Boarding Pass half slot
Mini-Zero Card slots

Right side: Watch Travel Kit Watch straps/pockets


A picture is worth a thousand words!


We didn't take any shortcuts when it came to selecting the highest quality materials for the build & assembly - we believe that with this combination, not only does the time piece look sleek but has an increased sense of luxury and quality.

We are so confident in the quality of our watches, that if something were to go wrong within 12 months, we will swap it over for you absolutely free. All our watches are backed with a 12 month factory warranty – which covers the watch from defects and manufacturing faults – please keep in mind that usual wear and tear is not covered.




*We have factored in the Chinese New Year holiday (As the most of February, our manufacturers will be on holiday) so production won't be completed until they return. Although we are planning to prepare production for some components earlier as our campaign progresses - to ensure that the production process is as smooth as possible.


Exposure is still one of the most important factors for any successful campaign, please share it to help us make this project come to life! You can share it from the links on top of the page or you can use the links below! Thank you for checking out our page!

<p>We have worked for months on developing the idea and prototypes of the new handmade jewelry collection ""Giving the sign"". </p>
<p>The main idea and inspiration behind the “Giving the sign” collection is letting the world know about the state of your soul and relationship status. Whether you are happy on your own, looking for someone or already have found the love of your life, this jewelry will help to thank the world for the chances already received and kindly ask for new adventures and opportunities. </p>
<p>The collection features necklaces, bracelets, rings and earrings, made of sterling silver and leather for both women and men. </p>
<p>The uniqueness of these products lie in the jewelry design in the form of fruit and vegetables, each of which carries a certain meaning to tell the universe and the people around you about your status, feelings and wishes. You can choose from jewelry which features lime, tomato or cabbage. </p>

In a playful,l yet subtle way this jewelry will help people to express their relationship status by giving the sign to the universe or other people, who might also be looking for someone. For instance, a tomato bracelet could help the right person to receive the right sign. Even if you are not looking for a relationship, or already have found the love of your life, there is nothing more endearing than a beautiful daily reminder about how lucky you truly are. </p>

</div></div>","3 wind knots - unique handmade jewelry, offered only in limited editions of high quality products. Each piece of jewelry has a particular story and meaning, which inspire, motivate and create positive feelings and emotions. Thus, they serve as talismans. The jewelry is designed by Sigita Trukšāne.
The inspiration and ideas for the jewelry design stem from the nature of Latvia, its forests, meadows, the Baltic Sea, as well as its history and culture. Mostly the jewelry is made out materials that can be found in Latvia.
The modern design of jewelry collections includes historic Baltic signs, goddesses, flowers, and animals. The products can be personalized to match the uniqueness of each person. 3 wind knots offers jewelry for all-women, men and children. 
The brand has been internationally recognized, and the jewelry is sold successfully in countries such as the UK, Germany, the USA, Canada, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan, Australia and others. The jewelry by 3 wind knots has repeatedly caught the British Vogue attention. 
Learn more about us at our WEBSITE. 






We have worked for months on developing the idea and prototypes of the new handmade jewelry collection ""Giving the sign"". 
The main idea and inspiration behind the “Giving the sign” collection is letting the world know about the state of your soul and relationship status. Whether you are happy on your own, looking for someone or already have found the love of your life, this jewelry will help to thank the world for the chances already received and kindly ask for new adventures and opportunities. 
The collection features necklaces, bracelets, rings and earrings, made of sterling silver and leather for both women and men. 
The uniqueness of these products lie in the jewelry design in the form of fruit and vegetables, each of which carries a certain meaning to tell the universe and the people around you about your status, feelings and wishes. You can choose from jewelry which features lime, tomato or cabbage. 





Lime hides its taste and color deep within, and is completely satisfied with this situation. You do not mind solitude, you enjoy your own company and are completely self-sufficient. If the right person comes along, there is a chance you will open up, but for now a single life is equally enjoyable and fun.

Tomato. The love fruit tomato will be a sign for others and the higher forces that you are open and ready for a new relationship. You are ready to share unforgettable adventures, joys and sorrows; all you have to do is tell the universe that you cannot wait to meet your other half and become whole.

Cabbage. You are happily together, and your relationship is a source of joy and stability. The cabbage symbolizes strength and security, its roots are just like your unshakeable love towards each other, while its leaves hide the countless wonderful moments you have spent together and will be spending together in the future!

So far we have created prototypes of the products and packaging, as well as several samples. Within this campaign with your support we wish to raise funds that would let us produce in larger quantities. The funds would go towards:

purchase of the materials for jewelry
purchase of the materials for packaging 
funding of the marketing materials for the campaign

Why should you participate? The answer is quite simple: to make the world a happier place for everyone. In a playful,l yet subtle way this jewelry will help people to express their relationship status by giving the sign to the universe or other people, who might also be looking for someone. For instance, a tomato bracelet could help the right person to receive the right sign. Even if you are not looking for a relationship, or already have found the love of your life, there is nothing more endearing than a beautiful daily reminder about how lucky you truly are. 


Please support us and help the people become happier and connect more easily! Feel free to share our campaign and let your friends know about this inspirational jewelry collection. 



















Last, but not least, we hope you enjoy the perks we have prepared for you. We truly appreciate any donation, big or small, and hope these pieces of jewelry will bring you back double the inspiration, support and motivation you have given us! Thank you!",21.0,1,"1 Campaign

</h1>
<div class=""1face_content"">
<p>Only One supports charities with contributions collected from the sale of apparel, primarily mens and ladies T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts, through our seasonal collection.</p>
<p>These tee's will feature special one off designs specifically for one of the six charity groups that it supports! They are:</p>
<p><strong>Food &amp; Hunger</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clean Water</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aids</strong></p>
<p><strong>Breast Cancer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cancer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Children</strong></p>
<p>Each collection will be strictly ""Limited Edition"". There will ONLY be 100 made per style, per design.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, there's a male and female version of all of tee's. So 6 Charities X 2 Versions X 100 MADE = 1200 Limited Edition designed tee's available. (100 per style)</p>
<p>To follow this up there will also be a range of Hooded sweatshirts for men and sweatshirts for women which will also feature the designs. Again, this is a completely limited edition run. ONLY 50 per style, per design will ever get made!</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, 6 Charities X 2 Versions X 50 MADE = 600 Limited Edition designed Hoodys/sweats available. (50 per style)</p>
<p><strong>Remember this: We are aiming to give around 60%+ of every one sold to our charity partner! </strong><strong>100% of funds raised by Only One go directly to the charities cause and NOT operating costs</strong></p>

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WHAT</span>
</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    Mink is in a battle to get vegan shoes on as many people as possible. Rebecca Mink will never give up. However, with long lead times for payment, stocking everyone's sizes, and the large shoe companies that Mink competes with it is a steep uphill battle. The truth is Mink needs your support.
    Over 14 years Mink has sold custom, grown to amazing boutiques, and even sold to the big boys at Zappos. All this done with a lot of passion, dedication, and confidence. Even with all this energy it has only allowed Mink to sustain at a certain level. The market
    is here!!! Mink gets requests from men and women all over the world daily looking for vegan shoes! Mink does not have the cash flow to keep up with the demand. Mink is poised ready and the market has arrived.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    With your help we can make our next collection, expand to lower price points, and create more availability for vegan shoes worldwide. This will bring investor attention and we will take off. The time for vegan shoes is NOW!
</p>
<p>
    Our new Indiegogo philosophy is the gather the people ..then build.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    This is sustainable and your support will grow Mink into the next phase where it will surely become one of the top vegan lifestyle brands of our time. The Mink shoe is made in the same prized Italian factories as Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Dolce and
    Gabbana, Jimmy Choo and more. All without harming animals!
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
<i>
    Mink is the next big thing in fashion. Join the movement! We need you to get there.
  </i>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    We are launching an Indiegogo campaign to push forward what we cannot do with a small team, limited cash flow, and infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    Mink can push forward what has never been done.
</p>
<p>
<b>1)</b><i> Gather </i> - With pre-sales Mink can allow women to choose high quality vegan shoes delivered to their doorstep. Your size, your color, your favorite.
</p>
<p>
<b>2)</b><i> Support</i> - We can make couture custom vegan shoes for men or women! What is your dream shoe? It does not have to be leather.
</p>
<p>
<b>3)</b><i> Give</i> - Mercy For Animals ..Support their lifesaving work for the animals!
</p>
<p>
<b>4)</b><i> Receive</i> - All animals will receive our respect and support. Show the world you care about animals by not wearing them. Be fashionably aware!
</p>
<p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WHERE</span>
</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    It really is true.... </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mink is made in the same factories as all of the most respected brands in the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    With no add campaigns, excess salaries, and overhead Mink can offer you an unbeatable price for an Italian made good. Rebecca Mink went to Italy in the year 2000 scouring the Tuscany region for the best shoe factories on the planet. Rebecca found them,
    built a longstanding relationship with them, and worked closely with them to create the best vegan shoe in the world.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    It is not alway easy working in Italy. Sure there is great Pasta and wine, but Italians are stubborn in a good way! They are connected to tradition and the craft of making shoes with your hands. Rebecca Mink adores the love and pride they have for making
    shoes and wants to support them. Mink has stayed with Italian production because those working on the shoes care about the product, are treated properly, and they deliver impeccable perfection every delivery.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    Mink has developed such a rapport with the great 4th and 5th generation Italian shoemaking artisans that we can offer custom couture shoes as well as production. Here is how the custom shoe works.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    We measure your foot, create a mold or ""last"" (sanded to perfection), put it into a machine (like an MRI) to make a duplicate 100% recycled plastic mold with a hinge to perfect the fit. This is your own personal mold with your name on it. Then we can make you any
    shoe you want with your ""last"". Mink is the only brand in the world offering this white glove service to the vegan community.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">WHY</span>
</h1>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
    Mink wants to get everyone an Italian shoe they can afford. At this time we are giving you $100 off all retail price of this collection in order to help! We are taking any profit and giving it directly to the amazing Mercy For Animals organization. We plan on lowering prices even more with expansion in the near future and your help. Simply put..Italian shoes cost more
    because they are better. Each shoe goes through a rigorous testing, development, and fit phase. You are getting the best!

Rebecca went on a life mission to never eat an animal because she knew it was wrong! Rebecca has worked as a wardrobe stylist to celebrities for the past 20 years. Mink shoes is self funded by Rebecca's ""day job"". Rebecca has not taken a salary ever nor will she see any funds from this campaign. Rebecca wants to make vegan shoes and Indiegogo gives her a platform to make it possible. Mink shoes is a true pioneer in vegan shoemaking.

WHO


    Mink is an ultra-luxe collection of Italian-made vegan shoes. Mink believes that you do not need give up quality, fit, creativity or style to be vegan. Minks mission is dedicated to leading the fashion industry into an era of responsibility towards
    animals, people and the planet!           Rebecca Mink founded Mink in the year 2000 with a simple vision.

    To change the way people see leather shoes. Leather shoes are not better then non leather. It is a misconception... an old school thought process embedded in our minds!


    Mink is made from the highest quality 100% Italian non animal components and fabrics. All materials are carefully chosen by Rebecca for their unique look, durability, eco properties, and factory conditions. Mink is dedicated to producing the highest quality
    vegan shoe without having to compromise. Why choose between being vegan and looking great? Mink makes it possible to be both.







WHAT


    Mink is in a battle to get vegan shoes on as many people as possible. Rebecca Mink will never give up. However, with long lead times for payment, stocking everyone's sizes, and the large shoe companies that Mink competes with it is a steep uphill battle. The truth is Mink needs your support.
    Over 14 years Mink has sold custom, grown to amazing boutiques, and even sold to the big boys at Zappos. All this done with a lot of passion, dedication, and confidence. Even with all this energy it has only allowed Mink to sustain at a certain level. The market
    is here!!! Mink gets requests from men and women all over the world daily looking for vegan shoes! Mink does not have the cash flow to keep up with the demand. Mink is poised ready and the market has arrived.


    With your help we can make our next collection, expand to lower price points, and create more availability for vegan shoes worldwide. This will bring investor attention and we will take off. The time for vegan shoes is NOW!


    Our new Indiegogo philosophy is the gather the people ..then build.


    This is sustainable and your support will grow Mink into the next phase where it will surely become one of the top vegan lifestyle brands of our time. The Mink shoe is made in the same prized Italian factories as Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Dolce and
    Gabbana, Jimmy Choo and more. All without harming animals!



    Mink is the next big thing in fashion. Join the movement! We need you to get there.
  


    We are launching an Indiegogo campaign to push forward what we cannot do with a small team, limited cash flow, and infrastructure.


    Mink can push forward what has never been done.


1) Gather  - With pre-sales Mink can allow women to choose high quality vegan shoes delivered to their doorstep. Your size, your color, your favorite.


2) Support - We can make couture custom vegan shoes for men or women! What is your dream shoe? It does not have to be leather.


3) Give - Mercy For Animals ..Support their lifesaving work for the animals!


4) Receive - All animals will receive our respect and support. Show the world you care about animals by not wearing them. Be fashionably aware!




WHERE


    It really is true.... Mink is made in the same factories as all of the most respected brands in the world.

    With no add campaigns, excess salaries, and overhead Mink can offer you an unbeatable price for an Italian made good. Rebecca Mink went to Italy in the year 2000 scouring the Tuscany region for the best shoe factories on the planet. Rebecca found them,
    built a longstanding relationship with them, and worked closely with them to create the best vegan shoe in the world.


    It is not alway easy working in Italy. Sure there is great Pasta and wine, but Italians are stubborn in a good way! They are connected to tradition and the craft of making shoes with your hands. Rebecca Mink adores the love and pride they have for making
    shoes and wants to support them. Mink has stayed with Italian production because those working on the shoes care about the product, are treated properly, and they deliver impeccable perfection every delivery.


    Mink has developed such a rapport with the great 4th and 5th generation Italian shoemaking artisans that we can offer custom couture shoes as well as production. Here is how the custom shoe works.


    We measure your foot, create a mold or ""last"" (sanded to perfection), put it into a machine (like an MRI) to make a duplicate 100% recycled plastic mold with a hinge to perfect the fit. This is your own personal mold with your name on it. Then we can make you any
    shoe you want with your ""last"". Mink is the only brand in the world offering this white glove service to the vegan community.










WHY


    Mink wants to get everyone an Italian shoe they can afford. At this time we are giving you $100 off all retail price of this collection in order to help! We are taking any profit and giving it directly to the amazing Mercy For Animals organization. We plan on lowering prices even more with expansion in the near future and your help. Simply put..Italian shoes cost more
    because they are better. Each shoe goes through a rigorous testing, development, and fit phase. You are getting the best!

FYI


A)
Rebecca Mink has never eaten an animal since age 4. Teh story is she was at a bday BBQ and a kid told her hot dogs were made from dogs. WHAT? Rebecca went on a life mission to never eat an animal because she knew it was wrong! Rebecca has worked as a wardrobe stylist to celebrities for the past 20 years. Mink shoes is self funded by Rebecca's ""day job"". Rebecca has not taken a salary ever nor will she see any funds from this campaign. Rebecca wants to make vegan shoes and Indiegogo gives her a platform to make it possible. Mink shoes is a true pioneer in vegan shoemaking.
    All funds will go toward this cause. We need your help to get to the next level.

<p>Spread the word and reap the rewards! If you refer friends to buy a tank, you both get one jellyfish upgraded from small to medium size (a $17 value for each of you)! To receive your upgrade after you buy your tank, forward your pledge confirmation email from Indiegogo to <a href=""http://mailto:info@jellyfishart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">info@jellyfishart.com</a> with the message ""I got a bigger jellyfish for [your friend's first and last names]!"" Then tell your friend to forward their confirmation email from Indiegogo to <a href=""http://mailto:info@jellyfishart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">info@jellyfishart.com</a> with the message ""[your first and last names] got me a bigger jellyfish!"" We'll message you back when we've received both emails to confirm you'll both get one jellyfish size upgrade. You can get up to three size upgrades (because the tank comes with three jellies), but feel free to tell <i>all</i> your friends!</p>
<p><b>Strettttttch Goal</b> -- If we reach $1M during this project, we'll automatically add a free small jellyfish to every one of our $250 reward packages (a $22 value)! That's not just three jellyfish, but four in total. Start the countdown!</p>

<p>One of the biggest improvements we have made to our company since our 2011 Kickstarter campaign is drastically improving our customer support system. We have attacked that from every angle by designing our product (and re-designing our existing products) to make jellyfish lifespan the top priority.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tutorials at <a href=""http://JellyfishArt.com/kb/start"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JellyfishArt.com/kb/start</a> guide you through every step from setup to maintenance with instructional diagrams, videos and articles (see the Setup and Acclimation videos below)</li>
<li>All our jellyfish come with a 30-Day Guarantee, so we replace them for free if needed. In reality, the jellyfish live a lot longer than that in this tank. We actually don't know how long yet because the jellies in our first running prototypes from seven months ago are still kicking!</li>
<li>We give live, personalized, one-on-one support via phone at (844) 535-5900, email at <a href=""http://mailto:info@jellyfishart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">info@jellyfishart.com</a> and live chat at <a href=""http://JellyfishArt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JellyfishArt.com</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your tank arrives in the first shipment and is easy to set up in ten minutes:</p>

<p>Then whenever you're ready for your non-stinging jellyfish, schedule your second shipment at <a href=""http://JellyfishArt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JellyfishArt.com</a> to be delivered to your doorstep. The $250 rewards include jellyfish, food and express shipping to anywhere in the contiguous U.S.. With the $150 reward, you can purchase jellyfish from us separately. Customers outside the U.S. can get the tank from us and get jellies from <a href=""http://jellyfishart.com/kb/shipping/international-shipping"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">partner suppliers</a>.</p>

<p>In 2011, Alex Andon and Mark Regal crowdfunded the Desktop Jellyfish Tank in one of the <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1497255984/desktop-jellyfish-tank"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first successful Kickstarter product launches</a>, transforming his hobby into a real business, Jellyfish Art. In 2013 they teamed up with us, Reef Aquaria Design. We are one of the nation’s premier custom aquarium design companies, a family-run business with three generations of experience. By combining Reef Aquaria Design’s expertise with Alex's original vision, we were able to make the original Desktop Jellyfish Tank much easier for customers to operate and maintain. Over the past several years, Jellyfish Art has made significant upgrades to its jellyfish aquaculture operation to improve the quality and consistency of our moon jellyfish and significantly increase their lifespan.</p>

</div></div>","** This Indiegogo campaign will be over this Sunday, May 1, so get in your discounted orders now while you can! **
We've already started shipping our Indiegogo Early Bird tanks!
 
 

 
Everyone can benefit from a moment of peace. Uncover your moment with a Jellyfish Cylinder Nano aquarium, the easiest and most affordable aquarium that makes keeping jellyfish simple for anyone.

Live jellyfish shipped year-round from our certified breeding facility right to your doorstep
Special laminar water flow pattern not possible in regular fish tanks mimics the natural open water habitat of jellyfish
Integrated mechanical, chemical and biological filtration in an accessible, hidden compartment makes it simple to operate and keep clean
Driven by a whisper quiet air pump that oxygenates the water and introduces no heat, keeping the jellyfish comfortable at room temperature
LED changes the colors of the jellyfish with the click of a remote control button
Made from durable, crystal clear acrylic hand-molded by the same factory we've been working with for five years
Comes with all the accessories you need so you just add water: LED, remote control, sponge filter, salt, air pump, pipette, activated charcoal, nitrifying bacteria starter, and hydrometer


 


 


 


 


 


 


 


   


 

 
  
  
  
  
 

 
Spread the word and reap the rewards! If you refer friends to buy a tank, you both get one jellyfish upgraded from small to medium size (a $17 value for each of you)! To receive your upgrade after you buy your tank, forward your pledge confirmation email from Indiegogo to info@jellyfishart.com with the message ""I got a bigger jellyfish for [your friend's first and last names]!"" Then tell your friend to forward their confirmation email from Indiegogo to info@jellyfishart.com with the message ""[your first and last names] got me a bigger jellyfish!"" We'll message you back when we've received both emails to confirm you'll both get one jellyfish size upgrade. You can get up to three size upgrades (because the tank comes with three jellies), but feel free to tell all your friends!
Strettttttch Goal -- If we reach $1M during this project, we'll automatically add a free small jellyfish to every one of our $250 reward packages (a $22 value)! That's not just three jellyfish, but four in total. Start the countdown!
 
 

 
One of the biggest improvements we have made to our company since our 2011 Kickstarter campaign is drastically improving our customer support system. We have attacked that from every angle by designing our product (and re-designing our existing products) to make jellyfish lifespan the top priority.

Tutorials at JellyfishArt.com/kb/start guide you through every step from setup to maintenance with instructional diagrams, videos and articles (see the Setup and Acclimation videos below)
All our jellyfish come with a 30-Day Guarantee, so we replace them for free if needed. In reality, the jellyfish live a lot longer than that in this tank. We actually don't know how long yet because the jellies in our first running prototypes from seven months ago are still kicking!
We give live, personalized, one-on-one support via phone at (844) 535-5900, email at info@jellyfishart.com and live chat at JellyfishArt.com


Your tank arrives in the first shipment and is easy to set up in ten minutes:

Then whenever you're ready for your non-stinging jellyfish, schedule your second shipment at JellyfishArt.com to be delivered to your doorstep. The $250 rewards include jellyfish, food and express shipping to anywhere in the contiguous U.S.. With the $150 reward, you can purchase jellyfish from us separately. Customers outside the U.S. can get the tank from us and get jellies from partner suppliers.

We prefer neat minimal design, monochrome palette and the highest quality with an affordable price. And we're totally crazy about accuracy and precision! That's why we used the miraculous power of science - all of our concepts are based on the researches, strict recommendations and direct involvement of actual mathematicians, architects and engineers, who helped us to create ultimate design with perfection in every detail.BETA SERIES: PASCAL / NEWTON / TURING / VOLTAWe decided that our next project must explore the evolution of the design concept further. It blends accuracy of calculations with the beauty of natural science. The βeta series is inspired with the greatest minds of mankind and their inventions and the greatest minds of our team put a lot of effort to achieve absolution in every line, curve and index mark on the watch dial. Divided By Zero is the golden section of watch design!BETA SERIES: GALILEO / ARCHIMEDESThis time we wanted to make every watch in the new series more individual and distinctive. Each watch has a strong connection between its design and concept, and for more character we added some prominent unique details to it. Meet the βeta series!NEWTONNEWTONNewton explores the idea of the trinity concept which is the basis for an every object we create. And it's a very attractive shape, too ;) The main feature of Newton is the dial's reflective surface with a slightly changing tone of its color. It's named after Isaac Newton, referring to his teachings and laws of motion.GALILEOGALILEOGalileo relies on pure minimalism in design. The concentric dial refers to orbits and the sub-dials are planet and its satellite. The most interesting feature is the partly sandwich dial which creates a multi-layer effect. This watch was named after the one of the greatest astronomers in history — Galileo Galilei.ARCHIMEDESARCHIMEDESArchimedes is the second one in our sub-dial department. It also has a sandwich volume dial and an ideally symmetrical face, supporting the whole idea of our mathematical design. Archimedes watch is the homage to the famous ancient Greek mathematician.PASCALPASCALPascal watch is the most complicated in the series! Yet simple to read the time, as always. It has a classic Nodus structure image on its dial. But the most notable thing is the handcrafted outer layer which is cut by the shape of the dial image! The watch's inspiration source is Blaise Pascal's researches. VOLTAVOLTAVolta is and ode to the geometrical beauty of the basic shape — circle, which is also a foundation in design for almost every watch. The model shares its name with the prominent Italian scientist Alessandro Volta.TURINGTURINGTuring follows up the minimalist path in the βeta series. Its dial is decorated with an infinite loop to depict the idea of the abstraction of time itself. It bears the name of a swift minded genius of Alan Turing.COPERNICUSCOPERNICUS BLACKCopernicus watch is inspired by famous Medieval astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus. Design of the model refers both to his personal astrolabe and to the theory of Copernican heliocentrism. Copernicus is available in two different color options: black or white. We are very proud with our concept we've brought to the first launch. That's why we decided to revise the αlpha series and present you the new enhanced versions of Gauss, Kepler, Plato and Euclid models. All αlpha watches come with the new thick strap with a spectacular red or blue edging and artificially weathered leather, domed crystal and reworked design, which slightly improves the initial developments preserving the main features. Suitable for those, who prefers more traditional outlook!ALPHA SERIES: GAUSS & KEPLERALPHA SERIES: EUCLID & PLATO Divided By Zero is a watch for everyone.We may be over our heads with the obsession with maths and science, but our goal is to create watches you'd like to wear! That's why we try to make it perfect in every aspect.We want Divided By Zero to become a part of everyone's wardrobe in the world! It's universality affords an easy strap change and suits every wrist with its massive yet sophisticated construction.We give our watches the character to fit the individuality of its owner.

The diamond beneath the Griffin’s foot in the logo is just the symbol of each well-designed accessory on the wrist. The word ""emblem"" is a reference to the treasure.</span></p>

<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Mechanical Automatic Movement</span></h4>
<p>All GRIFFIN EMBLEM watches use the Japanese MIYOTA 82S series mechanical automatic movement— with exquisite workmanship, this movement series is held to very high quality standards. Both the material selection and assembling technicians have a good reputation. The 82S series, which was selected by GRIFFIN EMBLEM, was one of its masterpieces. The fantastic hollowed out and naked pendulum design utilizes intricate carvings and shows off the manufacturing process—this makes the series’ movements perfect in functionality and beautiful in appearance.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">All GRIFFIN EMBLEM watches are made of 316L stainless steel, which comes from the United States. It is the standard steel number of the ""ASTM: American Society for Testing and Material."" Its corrosion resistance is remarkably strong and the texture is of high quality as well. L means low carbon. It has little impact on human skin and it is the only option for an advanced watch. The designers of GRIFFIN EMBLEM treat watches as artwork, and because of this choose only sophisticated Japanese mechanical movements to put within these pieces. We also focus on the process of polishing; the advanced technology of frosting and polishing makes the polish and texture of the watch fine and clear, and from there a strong three-dimensional appearance is formed.</span></p>

<h4>The Sapphire Crystal</h4>
<p>The glass of Griffin Emblem Watches are made of Sapphire crystal, which is the most expensive type of crystal for watches and is three times harder than mineral crystal. It is made of an extremely durable synthetic material that makes it shatterproof and scratch resistant (not scratch proof). It also has a non-reflective film to prevent glare.</p>

Check the pictures to see the reference of the particular watch you are looking at.<br/>2/ By clicking directly on the picture of the watch , it will redirect you to fill your information and then proceed to the payment. You can pay with Paypal (safest way to pay online)</p></div>
<div><b> 1a - How do I choose my watch / strap after I buy a contribution?</b></div>
<div>Please write a comment to tell us the model (s) you want.</div>
<div><b><b>2 - When will I receive my watch?</b></b></div>
<div> </div>
<p>We will do our best to start shipments in September/October 2016.This may vary depending on your localization.</p>
<p>(Delivery time of rewards / perks are subject to best efforts and are not guaranteed.)</p>

<div>Our products are manufactured and assembled in<b> </b>Hong Kong, in the best factories we could find. We have to ship from there, and because of this, the customs in your country may stop your package and tax it around 15%.

We are already offering free shipping and the customs are different in each country so we  <b>can not </b> refund you the customs fees.</div>
<div><b>5 - <b>I just bought a watch, and I regret doing so. Can you refund me</b>  ? </b></div>
<div>Regarding to the terms of Indiegogo, we cannot refund you. When you make a contribution to our project, we use the money to pay commissions to both Indiegogo and Paypal, and of course for the manufacture of the watch you preorder. We launch the production of the watch  <b>because </b> you bought it. If you help us with a contribution, be sure you want it, because we will not refund you (unless the project fails).

<p>L'histoire de la marque Griffin Emblem se compose de deux éléments . Le Griffon (lion-griffon) et son trésor . Le Griffon n'était pas seulement perçu comme l'un des rois des créatures mythologiques mais également comme le gardien et protecteur de trésors. Le diamant sous la patte du Griffon est le symbole de nos excellents accessoires liés au poignet. Le mot ""Emblem"" fait ici référence au trésor.</p>

<div>Nous souhaitions apporter au monde des montres élégantes, automatiques et de très bonne qualité, à un prix accessible a tous; c'est pourquoi nous avons lancé notre premier projet en Novembre 2014 via Indiegogo. Cette premiere campagne a été une veritable experience, notre rêve a vu le jour grace a tous nos contributeurs, et tout le soutien a permis d'amener notre tout premier projet à 576% de notre objectif avec 364 contributeurs. Notre projet a été inséré dans la newsletter d'Indiegogo et nous avons également fait la page d'accueil du site durant plusieurs jours.  Nous espérons recevoir autant de soutien de votre part.</div>

After a year of hard work, design & development, we are back ! This is our third fund-raising campaign, each new campaign gave us a chance to improve and upgrade the design and the technology. The success came from our backers from over 50 countries and the media who talked about us: 

 

  
Brand story of Griffin Emblem includes two parts: The Lion-Griffin and the Treasure. Griffin was not only perceived as the King of mythical creatures, but also as a symbol of the protector of a treasure. The diamond beneath the Griffin’s foot in the logo is just the symbol of each well-designed accessory on the wrist. The word ""emblem"" is a reference to the treasure.
 

 
 

 

We wanted to bring to the world high quality, automatic watches at an affordable price. After 3 successful campaigns on Indiegogo and thousand of happy backers, we decided to launch a third collection of higher specifications and quality automatic watches. We improved the design, technology, some features, and also proposed our best design selection in more colors.

We have the prototypes and everything else. The only thing missing is your support to launch the production !
 

  



For the backers who were involved in our previous collections, they know already that GRIFFIN EMBLEM is a synonym of quality, but for the new visitors, you can find our specifications below. Our last two collections helped us to understand more of your needs, so we decided to upgrade the design and technology. (For example: multilayer dials design, natural Ruby gemstones, detailing index, stainless steel reflector ring, better 3D effect of the logo, etc.). We are also bringing back the nice 42mm case as well and a genuine leather strap. Having a watch made by GRIFFIN EMBLEM means:  

 
• Best material selection & Top quality automatic watches
• Really affordable with a great quality-price ratio compared to the same specifications and quality products worldwide
• No battery needed
• A design that can go with professional and casual style
• Unisex
Each models will be limited in 100 pieces,  it will come with a unique serial number engraved on the back. 
We also bring back the customization of the metal plate, which allows you to customize your watch with a little message (see the pictures after the watches!)
 
To order your watch, just click on the picture of the watch you want , you can then fill your information and pay your perk :)

The Exhibition Back
The exhibition back lets you discover the beautiful movement of your automatic watch. You can also find a lot of information on the case back, such as your model, the brand, the name of the movement and also your serial number (000/100).

 
The Mechanical Automatic Movement
All GRIFFIN EMBLEM watches use the Japanese MIYOTA 82S series mechanical automatic movement— with exquisite workmanship, this movement series is held to very high quality standards. Both the material selection and assembling technicians have a good reputation. The 82S series, which was selected by GRIFFIN EMBLEM, was one of its masterpieces. The fantastic hollowed out and naked pendulum design utilizes intricate carvings and shows off the manufacturing process—this makes the series’ movements perfect in functionality and beautiful in appearance.

 
 The 316L Stainless Steel
All GRIFFIN EMBLEM watches are made of 316L stainless steel, which comes from the United States. It is the standard steel number of the ""ASTM: American Society for Testing and Material."" Its corrosion resistance is remarkably strong and the texture is of high quality as well. L means low carbon. It has little impact on human skin and it is the only option for an advanced watch. The designers of GRIFFIN EMBLEM treat watches as artwork, and because of this choose only sophisticated Japanese mechanical movements to put within these pieces. We also focus on the process of polishing; the advanced technology of frosting and polishing makes the polish and texture of the watch fine and clear, and from there a strong three-dimensional appearance is formed.


 

 
The Leather Packaging

All watches come with an elegant leather packaging. The package contains all the tools you’ll need to get your watch ready to wear in just a few seconds. This nice box has perfect dimensions and will fit perfectly into your drawer, your briefcase, or your purse. 

 

 
The Sapphire Crystal
The glass of Griffin Emblem Watches are made of Sapphire crystal, which is the most expensive type of crystal for watches and is three times harder than mineral crystal. It is made of an extremely durable synthetic material that makes it shatterproof and scratch resistant (not scratch proof). It also has a non-reflective film to prevent glare.

 
The Setting Of Zirconia Stone
RGS105 (2 Year Anniversary Limited Edition) have ""200"" pcs of zirconia stones. These stones are mounted using both claw setting and channel setting very carefully, which are professional setting techniques for making engagement rings or other luxury jewelry. 

  

 
 
 
 
 
 



The High Quality Leather Strap (with Quick-Release Pins)


Each GRIFFIN EMBLEM watch is equipped with an advanced leather strap, allowing you to not only appreciate its intricate craft, but also enjoy the comfortable feeling. This leather will last for ages and is very comfortable to wear. Each strap also has what we call ""quick release pins,"" so you can now change your strap in just a few seconds without any tools!



The DIY Metal Plate
 
With your watch, you will receive a blank metal plate. If you’d like to customize it, you can add the “Customization” perk to your order. If you choose to customize your metal plate with text, you will receive TWO metal plates: a blank one and an engraved one.
 
 
 
 
 
 



 
 

 
 
The stretch goals are a way to upgrade our product thanks to your contributions. If we reach a definite amount of money, we can make our watches better. This is our first stretch goal. We also want you to tell us what stretch goals you are looking for as well!
 

 
 




 
 

 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

Please take one second and  click on the logos below to share the project

 
Win Free Engraving for Your Metal Plate with a Single Click

 
 
We are ready to offer you customization for your watch in exchange for you helping us spread the word. When you share our project using the share button, it creates a special link only for you. With this link, we will be able to track the number of visits and sales you are bringing to our project.
STEP 1: You need to be logged in your account on Indiegogo. If you do not have an account, you can create one for free via Facebook Connect in around 20 seconds.
STEP 2: Go on our project and click on the buttons to share it. You can use Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and send the project by email to friends.
STEP 3: If someone buys a watch thanks to you, you will get a metal plate customized for FREE .
 
If we do not succeed in reaching the minimum amount of $ 15,000 for launching the products, you will be refunded. The only big risk is a delay in production. We are working with the best factories, but even if we are a brand, we are also customers, so we are dependent on the factories. We know there are a lot of attractive projects out there- this is not our first ride and we hope that you will help us for a third time.
 

1 - How do I buy?
2 ways:1/ On the right side of the campaign, you can see the price of each model. You need to click on the model you want to order. Each watch: has a reference (RG1008-1 for example). Check the pictures to see the reference of the particular watch you are looking at.2/ By clicking directly on the picture of the watch , it will redirect you to fill your information and then proceed to the payment. You can pay with Paypal (safest way to pay online)
 1a - How do I choose my watch / strap after I buy a contribution?
Please write a comment to tell us the model (s) you want.
2 - When will I receive my watch?
 
We will do our best to start shipments in September/October 2016.This may vary depending on your localization.
(Delivery time of rewards / perks are subject to best efforts and are not guaranteed.)
 3 - Do you ship worldwide and how much does it cost?
We ship worldwide and the shipping is free.
4 - Are there any extra fees?
Our products are manufactured and assembled in Hong Kong, in the best factories we could find. We have to ship from there, and because of this, the customs in your country may stop your package and tax it around 15%. In our experience, around 5 to 10% of our contributors had to pay customs fees. We are already offering free shipping and the customs are different in each country so we  can not  refund you the customs fees.
5 - I just bought a watch, and I regret doing so. Can you refund me  ? 
Regarding to the terms of Indiegogo, we cannot refund you. When you make a contribution to our project, we use the money to pay commissions to both Indiegogo and Paypal, and of course for the manufacture of the watch you preorder. We launch the production of the watch  because  you bought it. If you help us with a contribution, be sure you want it, because we will not refund you (unless the project fails). ( Terms of Indiegogo )
6 - I have another question. How can I reach you?
The easiest way to contact us is by commenting on the project, or sending us an email at alain.recuze@gmail.com. We will answer you within 48 hours. If you do not receive an answer, feel free to write to us again reminding us to answer you. We may be busy, or we simply may have forgotten about it, after all- we are only humans. You can also find us on our social networks.

Après un an de travail, de design et d'amélioration nous sommes de retour ! C'est notre troisième campagne de financement participatif, chaque projet nous a permis  d'apprendre et d'optimiser notre technologie. Le succès de nos projets viennent de nos contributeurs de plus de 50 pays , et des médias qui ont parlés de nous :
 

 




 



L'histoire de la marque Griffin Emblem se compose de deux éléments . Le Griffon (lion-griffon) et son trésor . Le Griffon n'était pas seulement perçu comme l'un des rois des créatures mythologiques mais également comme le gardien et protecteur de trésors. Le diamant sous la patte du Griffon est le symbole de nos excellents accessoires liés au poignet. Le mot ""Emblem"" fait ici référence au trésor.





 

 

Nous souhaitions apporter au monde des montres élégantes, automatiques et de très bonne qualité, à un prix accessible a tous; c'est pourquoi nous avons lancé notre premier projet en Novembre 2014 via Indiegogo. Cette premiere campagne a été une veritable experience, notre rêve a vu le jour grace a tous nos contributeurs, et tout le soutien a permis d'amener notre tout premier projet à 576% de notre objectif avec 364 contributeurs. Notre projet a été inséré dans la newsletter d'Indiegogo et nous avons également fait la page d'accueil du site durant plusieurs jours.  Nous espérons recevoir autant de soutien de votre part.

L’arrière du boitier

L’arrière du boitier dispose également d'un design dit Squlette pour vous laisser admirer la beauté du mouvement de votre montre automatique. On peut également y voir de nombreuses informations comme la marque, le numéro de série gravé (pour les 100 premieres pièces de chaque modèle), le mouvement et la référence du modèle.



 
Le mouvement

Toutes les montres GRIFFIN EMBLEM utilisent la série japonaise Miyota 82S de mouvements mécaniques automatiques, une execution exquise et supervisée par des normes de haute qualité. Ce mouvement dispose d'une très bonne reputation, a la fois sur le choix des matériaux mais aussi sur son assemblage. La serie 82S est l'une des plus belles oeuvres de Miyota (Citizen). Sa conception est faite de sculptures complexes. La presence de rubis expose de façon élégante son processus de fabrication et renforce également son degré de qualité. Les rubis réduisent les frottements au sein du mécanisme et améliore donc sa longévité. Cet ensemble donne de très beaux mouvements.

 
L'acier
Toutes les montres GRIFFIN EMBLEM sont faites d'acier inoxydable 316L. 316L est une reference destinée a l'acier, aux Etat-Unis. La reference 316 provient de la societe ""ASTM, American Society for Testing and Material"". Sa capacité de resistance a la corrosion est très forte et la texture de celui-ci est aussi tres bonne. L signifie Low carbon. Il aura donc peu d'impact sur la peau humaine et il est l'une des meilleures options disponible pour les montres complexes. Les designers de GRIFFIN EMBLEM  considèrent les montres comme des oeuvres d'art, en plus de choisir un mouvement mécanique japonais sophistique, ils mettent également l'accent sur le processus du vernissage, sur sa technologie de pointe de givre et de polissage, ce qui rend la texture de la montre claire, qui lui permet un fort aspect tridimensionnel.

 

 
Le packaging de la montre

Chaque montre sera livrée avec un packaging elegant et unique. Sa petite taille vous permet de le ranger facilement dans votre tiroir, votre valise ou pourquoi pas votre sac a main. Chaque coffret est compose du cadran de la montre, son bracelet, la plaque de metal et ses accessoires, ainsi qu'un manuel d'instructions a lire avant utilisation de la montre.


 
 
Le verre saphir 
Chaque montre GRIFFIN EMBLEM est équipée d'un verre en saphir, très résistant.

 
 
Les Pierres Zircone
RGS105 (Edition Limitée pour les 2 ans) contient ""200"" pieces de pierre Zircone. Ces dernières sont en serti griffes, ces pierres ne vous feront pas défauts. 


 

 
Le bracelet (avec ouverture facile)
Chacune des montres GRIFFIN EMBLEM est équipée d'un bracelet en cuir de qualité, ce qui vous permet non seulement d’apprécier son artisanat complexe, mais aussi de profiter de la sensation de confort de celui-ci. Chaque bracelet est très confortable et durera dans le temps. De plus, chaque bracelet est équipé d'une ""ouverture facile"", qui vous permet de changer de bracelet en quelques secondes seulement ! (voir video plus bas)
 
 


  
La plaque de metal personnalisable
Chaque montre Griffin Emblem est composée d'une petite plaque métallique sur le côté de la montre. Cette plaque est avant tout un choix esthétique mais peut également être personnalisée. Si vous faites le choix d'acheter la contrepartie ""Customization"" votre montre sera livrée avec deux plaques, l'originale ""vierge"" et la seconde gravée avec votre message (limite a 10 caractères). Les vis et le tournevis sont bien entendu fournis avec votre montre. La plaque est de couleur argent sur chaque modèle.
 

   
 
 
Notre objectif est de récolter 15 000$ , cependant si nous dépassons ce montant nous mettrons en place des paliers de financement. Ces paliers nous permettent d’améliorer les montres de façon significative. Le premier objectif est situé a 30 000$ et permettra d'obtenir des aiguilles luminescente de meilleur qualité, ainsi que des vis de rechange pour la plaque de métal. Dites nous par commentaire toutes vos idées sur les améliorations possibles pour le palier suivant.",111.0,4,"4 Campaigns

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Made in Europe</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Our Boxers are made in Portugal and assembled in Austria under fair labour standards. We believe that fair wages result in high quality products. Change is underway, but we think it needs to progress at a faster pace. That’s why we’ve created True Boxers. It’s our business model for a global change in purchasing and supplier practices, workers’ rights and social responsibility.

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Durable</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Our fabrics and stitching are of exceptional durable quality, in order to ensure our products to be long lasting.

</div><div>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">100% Cotton</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. We use high-quality cotton that has an extra-long staple – what this means is that it has longer fibers, resulting in a silkier, more durable fabric.

</div><div>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Poplin Quality</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Poplin is a plain weave, which means the threads alternately cross over and then under each other. This results in a very smooth and durable fabric, particularly with higher thread counts. Also, garments made out of poplin look very crisp when ironed. Our boxers are made in poplin quality with 120 grams which gives you the feeling that you’re wearing a very lightweight fabric.</span>

</div></div>","We’re Alex and Marcus, the creators of „True Boxers“. Our journey started almost more than a year ago when we decided to take a different approach towards how boxer shorts are made.Our mission is to create durable boxer shorts with fun prints without compromising on fit, quality and ethical production.Most brands these days purposely make goods which are meant to fall apart after a few years. We want to create boxer shorts that are fashionable, but made from materials that are durable. We call our mission 'Sustainable Fashion'. In other words, True Boxers aims to be an apparel label that enables you to have sustainable but still fashionable boxer shorts. We’ve spent the past year vigorously researching properly certified cotton suppliers with the same mindset as us, and manufacturers with fair working conditions.After a long journey we found our perfect match, our supplier in Spain and our manufacturer in Portugal - both are committed to the integrity of their staff. It’s been our goal to only use certified poplin cotton as well as environmentally friendly dye. This ensures that your pair of boxers is made of the softest, most comfortable and sustainable fabric possible.Help us eliminate fast fashion & move towards sustainable fair fashion. We believe that creativity and confidence leads individuals to generate true sustainable changes in this world. With our product we want to set a new benchmark for men’s underwear.
Design. Our design is unique, fun and timeless. 

Perfect Fit. We’ve been working closely with our manufacturer over the past 4 months in order to develop the perfect fit. So far we have created almost 20 different prototypes in order to find the optimal cut.

Sustainability. There is constant pressure to keep pushing for a higher level of sustainability, both environmentally as well as socioeconomically. Our certified fabric from Spain contains environmentally friendly dye.

Made in Europe. Our Boxers are made in Portugal and assembled in Austria under fair labour standards. We believe that fair wages result in high quality products. Change is underway, but we think it needs to progress at a faster pace. That’s why we’ve created True Boxers. It’s our business model for a global change in purchasing and supplier practices, workers’ rights and social responsibility. We’re going further than any fashion company has ever gone, and we’re encouraging you to follow our lead.

Soft Waistband. Our Boxers feature an elasticized waistband and a softer fabric than most other waistbands for superior comfort.

Durable. Our fabrics and stitching are of exceptional durable quality, in order to ensure our products to be long lasting. We use the lockstitch method which results in a much stronger seam that is difficult to rip and is less prone to puckering.

100% Cotton. We use high-quality cotton that has an extra-long staple – what this means is that it has longer fibers, resulting in a silkier, more durable fabric. Our fabric costs may be higher, but we think that the difference will be noticeable.

Poplin Quality. Poplin is a plain weave, which means the threads alternately cross over and then under each other. This results in a very smooth and durable fabric, particularly with higher thread counts. Also, garments made out of poplin look very crisp when ironed. Our boxers are made in poplin quality with 120 grams which gives you the feeling that you’re wearing a very lightweight fabric.

Quality Control. And of course all of our True Boxers must pass our “hand-check"".


For our Kickstarter Campaign, we’ve designed 6 unique and timeless boxer shorts for men.


















Because we are a young startup company, we aren’t able to afford the minimum order quantities (just over € 20,000) required to complete a full production run of our TRUE BOXERS. We`ve spent the last 12 months developing our prototypes and our mission.
Now we need your help and backing to reach these minimum order quantities to get TRUE BOXERS up and running. We think everyone deserves a pack of unique boxers for the world to see. If we reach our goal, we’ll be able to purchase the minimum order quantities and deliver TRUE BOXERS straight to your doorstep.

You Just Found - THE MISSING LINK,


IN HOME CARPET MAINTENANCE!


For Reappearing Spots, Soaked-In Spills and Pet Urine Clean-Up! 

 
Hi, We’re Paul and Dennis, professional carpet cleaners and the original inventer and producers of Sub-Surface extraction. Our patented tools revolutionized professional carpet cleaning, and starting here at Indiegogo, we intend to do the same for home carpet maintenance. 

The SpotVac, delivers the same Sub-Surface Extraction power as used by the pros for pulling pet urine and other kinds of spots and spills from carpeted flooring...

Did you know, those little pet accedents on carpet don’t just evaporate; they accumulate in the “sub-surfaces” beneath the carpet, embedded in the backing and pad, growing more toxic as bateria mulitply.

Spills from soda-pop, milk, coffee and more also become trapped under carpets and are the source of those maddening, re-appearing spots.

No other carpet cleaning systems available for home use is designed to remove contaminants from under the carpet where the real problem exists. And that means spots and odors just keep coming back.

Professional carpet cleaners handle these kinds of messy disasters with a process called “Sub-Surface Extraction.” The good news for carpet owners is that the ultimate professonal solution is now available for the rest of us!

And not a piddle too soon, as pet urine left in carpeted flooring forms what may be the most severe contamination problem in your home.The hidden urine will dry to a gummy residue and produce bacteria that off-gas their putrid odor. Aside from the obvious health concerns, the unwittingly pet owner can become blissfully desensitized to these odors, while their visiting guests are gagging and turning green from the smell of old pet urine!

After 12 years of perfecting sub-surface extraction in the profesional carpet cleaning industry, the experts at SpotClean, have created the “SpotVac” a simple, easy-to-use, ultra-tough tool that can be attached to any common wet-vac as small as 2.5 horse power.

<p>We have a vision and plan to create an easy, interactive photo design tool that can be adapted to be both an app and an online platform—<strong>Fotogenic</strong>. </p>
<p>The beauty of our product is that it’s not just another ""photo upload tool,"" it's a multi-destinational widget that will be populated with art and photo flair relevant to the particular site it’s living on. As such, it plays on the obsessive persistence of those eager to express their personal style at an online destination they would organically navigate towards anyway. </p>
<p>This tool will have its own destination website and iOS applications AND will live on top of various blogs and sites as a pop-up overlay that expands for easy interaction. The key is to allow customers to do extraordinary things with their photos. From couture collectors to retro enthusiasts, alternative families to goth debutantes, Fotogenic will allow anyone and everyone to get creative by adding digital “flair” to their photos and producing amazing cards, gifts, and high-end prints. Plus, they can share their creations via social media outlets. </p>

<p><strong>Why would someone put <em>our</em> tool on <em>their</em> website?</strong></p>
</div>
<div>Because they will generate revenue from any photo product someone orders from their site (not to mention the tool will relate to their content and help reflect their site's passion and style). We have buy-ins from a handful of very enthusiastic blog owners and retail outlets.
<p>We already have a back-end media provider ready to print and distribute these orders. We have done extensive research and vetting of companies to find a print house that is open to new creative offerings and isn't driven or reliant on their own back-end technology. </p>
<p>In addition, we have future product offerings ready once the tool is launched, and we’re able to invest in alternative materials and creative concepts such as 3D papercrafts and more complicated form factors.</p>

<p>The total cost of production Winter 2015-16 is 40,000 € including port.<br/></p>
<p>Little Moon produces very small quantities per model color combination,
in order to offer a wider range of model: is only 20 to 30 pairs / style /
color.</p>
<br/>
<div align=""center"">
<h2><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h2>
</div>
<br/>
<p>The shoe is one of the most complex clothing products because to achieve
a single shoe, nearly 10 suppliers or more, intervene at each stage of its
manufacture, and each must therefore ensure his part, with all its
professionalism.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It's always a big challenge because deadlines needed to respected, the
quality of comfort insured, also for materials, manufacturing, and delivery.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
other challenge is to pay the factory who manufactures the new collection : Little
Moon must, from the start of production , settles a deposit of 50 % of the
total , to launch the purchases of raw materials.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Then in late August , after quality control, and reception pairs ,
Little Moon must honor the 2nd part of the amount to the plant.<br/>
</p>
<br/><div align=""center"">
<h2><b>Good Reasons to support Little Moon:</b></h2>
</div>
<br/><p>
1. You support young French fashion shoedesigners: Carole has established
Little Moon with her savings , and with the support of a bank that has agreed
to follow her in this great adventure . She also received support from the CTC
( Technical Center of Leather ) for her first 2 collections as part of the
"" Support to Creation."" It is the know-how and French creation that
you support also in this way.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>2.  Wear models LITTLE MOON is favoring chic and comfort, a new version of
the modern woman who assumes her femininity while highlighting as well.</p>
<p>

3.
Little Moon develops a wide range of shoe models,
marrying all facets of a dressing : brut jeans to flower skirt or the famous
little black dress, each Little Moon model will add the little extra that your
outfit would enjoy.</p>
<p>

4. 

Carole studied with thoroughness and rigor each last camber and heel,
ensuring exceptional comfort to enhance the women flourishing. She chooses her
leathers for their softness, flexibility and originality, tests them so each
shoe respects the foot, and perfectly hugs its morphology.

<p>Le coût total de la production Hiver 2015-16 est de 40.000€ incluant les frais de port.</p><p>Little Moon produit de très petites quantités par modèle
au colori, afin de pouvoir proposer un plus large éventail de modèles :
soit seulement de 20 à 30 paires /modèle/couleur.
</p>
<br/><h2 align=""center""><b>Risques et Challenges</b></h2><p></p>
<br/>
<p>La chaussure est l’un des produits les plus complexes de l’habillement, car pour réaliser une seule chaussure, près de 10 fournisseurs, voire davantage interviennent à chaque étape de sa fabrication, et chacun doit donc assurer sa partie, avec tout son professionnalisme.</p>
<p>C’est toujours un énorme challenge car il faut tenir, en plus des délais, la
qualité du confort, des matières, de la fabrication, et des livraisons.</p>
<p>L’autre challenge est de régler l’usine qui assure la fabrication la nouvelle
collection : </p>
<p>Little Moon doit, dès le lancement de la production, régler un déposit de 50% du montant total, afin de lancer les achats des matières premières.</p>
<p>Puis fin août , après le contrôle qualité, et à réception des paires, Little Moon doit honorer la 2<sup>nde</sup> partie du montant à l’usine.<br/></p>
<h2 align=""center""><b>Les bonnes raisons <br/></b></h2>
<h2 align=""center""><b>de soutenir Little Moon :</b></h2>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Vous soutenez la jeune création française : Carole a
mis sur pied Little Moon avec ses économies, et grâce à l’appui d’une banque
qui a accepté de la suivre dans cette grande aventure. Elle a aussi bénéficié
du soutien du CTC  (Centre Technique du
Cuir) pour ses 2 premières collections dans le cadre de « l’ Aide à
la Création ». C’est le savoir faire et
la création française que vous soutenez en contribuant.</li>
<li>Porter les modèles LITTLE MOON, c’est privilégier le chic
et le confort, une nouvelle version de la femme moderne qui s’assume tout en
valorisant sa féminité. (La femme est ici sujet et non pas objet).</li>
<li>Little Moon développe un large éventail de modèles, se mariant avec
toutes les facettes d’un
dressing : du jean brut à la jupe florale en passant par la fameuse
petite robe noire, chaque modèle Little Moon saura ajouter le petit plus qu’il
faut à votre tenue.</li>
<li>Carole étudie avec minutie et rigueur chaque cambrure et chaque
talon, afin de garantir un confort exceptionnel et favoriser l’épanouissement
de la femme. Elle choisit ses cuirs pour leur douceur, souplesse et originalité, les teste
pour que chaque chaussure respecte le pied et épouse parfaitement chaque
morphologie.</li>

Planning





Budget Attribution



The total cost of production Winter 2015-16 is 40,000 € including port.
Little Moon produces very small quantities per model color combination,
in order to offer a wider range of model: is only 20 to 30 pairs / style /
color.


Risks & Challenges


The shoe is one of the most complex clothing products because to achieve
a single shoe, nearly 10 suppliers or more, intervene at each stage of its
manufacture, and each must therefore ensure his part, with all its
professionalism.


It's always a big challenge because deadlines needed to respected, the
quality of comfort insured, also for materials, manufacturing, and delivery.


The
other challenge is to pay the factory who manufactures the new collection : Little
Moon must, from the start of production , settles a deposit of 50 % of the
total , to launch the purchases of raw materials.


Then in late August , after quality control, and reception pairs ,
Little Moon must honor the 2nd part of the amount to the plant.


Good Reasons to support Little Moon:


1. You support young French fashion shoedesigners: Carole has established
Little Moon with her savings , and with the support of a bank that has agreed
to follow her in this great adventure . She also received support from the CTC
( Technical Center of Leather ) for her first 2 collections as part of the
"" Support to Creation."" It is the know-how and French creation that
you support also in this way.


2.  Wear models LITTLE MOON is favoring chic and comfort, a new version of
the modern woman who assumes her femininity while highlighting as well.


3.
Little Moon develops a wide range of shoe models,
marrying all facets of a dressing : brut jeans to flower skirt or the famous
little black dress, each Little Moon model will add the little extra that your
outfit would enjoy.


4. 

Carole studied with thoroughness and rigor each last camber and heel,
ensuring exceptional comfort to enhance the women flourishing. She chooses her
leathers for their softness, flexibility and originality, tests them so each
shoe respects the foot, and perfectly hugs its morphology.

Emblème de la
séduction par excellence, la chaussure parle de votre côté le plus intime, elle
se doit d’être en priorité
confortable, puis esthétique, pour  valoriser la silhouette. 
Ceci dans le but de permettre
à la femme de s’épanouir dans sa vie, tout en respectant son style, son univers
et aussi favoriser sa confiance en elle.












Créer des chaussures féminines,
élégantes, et confortables pour 
toutes les femmes actives qui souhaitent être
au top de leur beauté au quotidien : 

Voici
le défi que relève Little Moon dans toutes ses collections.

Qui est Little Moon ?



Little Moon s’adresse aux femmes actives, ces héroïnes de la vie, guerrières lumineuses, princesses combattantes, fragiles et si fortes amazones qui oeuvrent  pour s’épanouir dans leur vie de femme, tant personnellement que professionnellement.



Basée à Paris, Little Moon a été créée en 2008 par Carole Berger, styliste de formation. Elle réinterprète en style son idée de la féminité, mixe rigueur et fantaisie à la recherche de cette subtile audace qu’est l’élégance.


Ses collections chaussures sont ainsi développées dans un style dit « Cool Chic Classic Chic », décalant des grands basiques, lignes rétro, autour de détails traditionnels avec une touche de luminescence dans ses jeux de talons phosphorescents et réfléchissants.





Little Moon vient de terminer le développement de sa 9ème et nouvelle collection Hiver 2015-16. 
Elle s’appelle : « Moonlight Bite » (Morsure au Clair de Lune), 
en référence aux jeux de clair/obscur qui accentuent les effets de perspectives 
et le dynamisme des lignes





Pour cette nouvelle collection H15-16, Little Moon a développé 12 modèles déclinés entre 2 ou 4 coloris, soit 334options au total. 
Tous les modèles sont réalisés en cuir pour le dessus et l'intérieur. La semelle est argent, et en élastomère, car imperméable, plus pratique pour une chaussure hiver.
Les tailles vont du 36 au 41. Pointure française.

C'est pour produire 
cette nouvelle collection Hiver que Little Moon vous sollicite !


Pour vous remercier de votre soutien et participation, vous bénéficiez :


de tarifs exceptionnels sur les modèles de la nouvelle collection !
de la garantie d'avoir votre paire préférée, en avant première !

de nombreux goodies exclusifs, spécialement conçus
pour vous ! 



L'heure est donc à relever ce challenge, et c'est le moment pour vous d'en profiter :

Planning

Répartition du budget





Le coût total de la production Hiver 2015-16 est de 40.000€ incluant les frais de port.Little Moon produit de très petites quantités par modèle
au colori, afin de pouvoir proposer un plus large éventail de modèles :
soit seulement de 20 à 30 paires /modèle/couleur.

Risques et Challenges

La chaussure est l’un des produits les plus complexes de l’habillement, car pour réaliser une seule chaussure, près de 10 fournisseurs, voire davantage interviennent à chaque étape de sa fabrication, et chacun doit donc assurer sa partie, avec tout son professionnalisme.
C’est toujours un énorme challenge car il faut tenir, en plus des délais, la
qualité du confort, des matières, de la fabrication, et des livraisons.
L’autre challenge est de régler l’usine qui assure la fabrication la nouvelle
collection : 
Little Moon doit, dès le lancement de la production, régler un déposit de 50% du montant total, afin de lancer les achats des matières premières.
Puis fin août , après le contrôle qualité, et à réception des paires, Little Moon doit honorer la 2nde partie du montant à l’usine.
Les bonnes raisons 
de soutenir Little Moon :


Vous soutenez la jeune création française : Carole a
mis sur pied Little Moon avec ses économies, et grâce à l’appui d’une banque
qui a accepté de la suivre dans cette grande aventure. Elle a aussi bénéficié
du soutien du CTC  (Centre Technique du
Cuir) pour ses 2 premières collections dans le cadre de « l’ Aide à
la Création ». C’est le savoir faire et
la création française que vous soutenez en contribuant.
Porter les modèles LITTLE MOON, c’est privilégier le chic
et le confort, une nouvelle version de la femme moderne qui s’assume tout en
valorisant sa féminité. (La femme est ici sujet et non pas objet).
Little Moon développe un large éventail de modèles, se mariant avec
toutes les facettes d’un
dressing : du jean brut à la jupe florale en passant par la fameuse
petite robe noire, chaque modèle Little Moon saura ajouter le petit plus qu’il
faut à votre tenue.
Carole étudie avec minutie et rigueur chaque cambrure et chaque
talon, afin de garantir un confort exceptionnel et favoriser l’épanouissement
de la femme. Elle choisit ses cuirs pour leur douceur, souplesse et originalité, les teste
pour que chaque chaussure respecte le pied et épouse parfaitement chaque
morphologie.

Que fera Little Moon avec l’argent

La première étape est de régler le

coupe. Puis sont lancées les commandes avec les fournisseurs de matières
premières. A réception et contrôle de tous les matériaux, la fabrication des
chaussures peut être lancée. Afin d'assurer la meilleure qualité du processus
de production, le délai est de deux mois.

20 jours sont
nécessaires pour recevoir les fonds
recueillis, aussi les chaussures Little
Moon pourront vous être livrées moins
de 3 mois après la fin de la
campagne.
Quand vais-je recevoir ma paire de
Little Moon ?

En espérant recueillir tous vos choix

Voici la grille des correspondances par pointure

<li><p>High recurring costs</p></li>
<li><p>Health problems due to prolonged smoke inhalation</p></li>
<li><p>Fire hazards</p></li>
<li><p>Poor light quality, which leads to eye strain</p></li>
</ul><p>Luckily, there is a proven solution to the problems associated with kerosene: solar power.  When solar lamps are used instead of kerosene, it has been shown to dramatically improve lives.  Solar power not only solves many of the problems of kerosene, it also creates added value.  Solar lamps have many benefits:</p><ul>
<li><p>Sunlight is free</p></li>
<li><p>There is no smoke to irritate the eyes or damage the lungs</p></li>
<li><p>Fire hazards are essentially eliminated</p></li>
<li><p>Solar lamps are much brighter than kerosene lanterns</p></li>
<li><p>Many solar lamps include USB ports to charge mobile devices, which are an important  and growing part of African life, even in rural areas</p></li>
</ul><p>At AGOGO Solar, we believe that these benefits can have far-reaching effects.  Families who have solar power can work and study into the evening, providing additional income and improving opportunities for children.  Users of the Sun King Pro 2 (the lamp we’re selling) have reported a 25% increase in household income and a 75% increase in study time.  They are also able to charge their phone when they need to, rather than having to pay to use a public charging station.  Access to energy truly changes lives.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432341157/zh41ynhxjk9w3oaxo8tj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Why Uganda?</b></p><p>Uganda is one of the most disadvantaged nations in the world, ranking in the lowest 10% of countries in terms of average income per capita and the lowest third of countries in Africa.  Half a gallon of kerosene costs about as much as the average day’s wages in Uganda (just $1.64).  Yet up to three quarters of the country still relies on kerosene for household lighting.</p><p>Despite the clear advantages solar energy offers, it has failed to gain traction and widespread adoption in Uganda.  One of the greatest factors contributing to this is the high upfront cost of switching to solar.  Solar lamps cost between $40 and $50, which is out of reach for many, especially in rural areas.  Our model provides microfinancing with individualized payment plans, giving people a way to pay for lamps over time.  This makes it possible for millions to afford to switch to solar who couldn’t before.</p><p>Jenny (one of our team members) was in Uganda for a study abroad in 2013 to interview former child soldiers from the country’s civil war.  She made many friends and witnessed firsthand how solar power could benefit the people.  We have been working with some of Jenny’s friends in Uganda to do market research and validation of our model, and we have already sold several lamps.  The work we have done so far has shown that this model will be successful in Uganda, and we are confident that it will continue to grow rapidly and sustainably.</p><p><b>The Plan</b></p><p>AGOGO Solar is using two key tools to make solar lamps more available than ever before: microfinancing and a direct sales model.</p><p>Our flexible microfinancing approach allows people to start using their lamp after paying only a small deposit.  They then pay the rest of the lamp off after time through small weekly payments.  Once the lamp is fully paid off, the customer owns it outright and never has to pay for light again for the lifetime of the lamp.  If the customer is unable to continue making payments,

 Thanks!</p><br/></div>","Live brighter with AGOGOWhen was the last time you reached for the light switch and hoped it would turn on?  Or the last time you had to put your book away because the sun was setting?  If you’re reading this right now, the odds are that you will never have to worry about having light when you need it.  But for more than a billion people on this planet, daily access to electricity is simply not a reality.  Not only is this inconvenient, it also seriously hinders the ‘developing’ in developing countries.  With your support, AGOGO Solar can help change that.Starting in Uganda, we have a plan to make consistent, affordable access to light a possibility.  Not only do we want to get solar power to those who need it, we want to create jobs and train future leaders in Uganda.  That’s why we are building a solution that empowers Africans to be able to afford high-quality, proven solar lamps that are already on the market.AGOGO has sold several lamps in Gulu, Uganda and is recruiting a team of Ugandans to form a team of direct sales distributors.  In addition to selling lamps, these distributors demonstrate the lamps to their friends and neighbors and educate them on the benefits of switching to solar.  This model leverages existing social groups and the strong sense of community in Ugandan culture to help solar power catch on.  We also offer flexible microfinancing to help families afford to make the switch.  We hope to build a strong base in northern Uganda and then expand from there.Why Solar?Most people in Sub-Saharan Africa light their homes with kerosene.  While kerosene is simple and readily available, it is also outdated and dangerous.  Kerosene presents families with several problems:
High recurring costs
Health problems due to prolonged smoke inhalation
Fire hazards
Poor light quality, which leads to eye strain
Luckily, there is a proven solution to the problems associated with kerosene: solar power.  When solar lamps are used instead of kerosene, it has been shown to dramatically improve lives.  Solar power not only solves many of the problems of kerosene, it also creates added value.  Solar lamps have many benefits:
Sunlight is free
There is no smoke to irritate the eyes or damage the lungs
Fire hazards are essentially eliminated
Solar lamps are much brighter than kerosene lanterns
Many solar lamps include USB ports to charge mobile devices, which are an important  and growing part of African life, even in rural areas
At AGOGO Solar, we believe that these benefits can have far-reaching effects.  Families who have solar power can work and study into the evening, providing additional income and improving opportunities for children.  Users of the Sun King Pro 2 (the lamp we’re selling) have reported a 25% increase in household income and a 75% increase in study time.  They are also able to charge their phone when they need to, rather than having to pay to use a public charging station.  Access to energy truly changes lives.Why Uganda?Uganda is one of the most disadvantaged nations in the world, ranking in the lowest 10% of countries in terms of average income per capita and the lowest third of countries in Africa.  Half a gallon of kerosene costs about as much as the average day’s wages in Uganda (just $1.64).  Yet up to three quarters of the country still relies on kerosene for household lighting.Despite the clear advantages solar energy offers, it has failed to gain traction and widespread adoption in Uganda.  One of the greatest factors contributing to this is the high upfront cost of switching to solar.  Solar lamps cost between $40 and $50, which is out of reach for many, especially in rural areas.  Our model provides microfinancing with individualized payment plans, giving people a way to pay for lamps over time.  This makes it possible for millions to afford to switch to solar who couldn’t before.Jenny (one of our team members) was in Uganda for a study abroad in 2013 to interview former child soldiers from the country’s civil war.  She made many friends and witnessed firsthand how solar power could benefit the people.  We have been working with some of Jenny’s friends in Uganda to do market research and validation of our model, and we have already sold several lamps.  The work we have done so far has shown that this model will be successful in Uganda, and we are confident that it will continue to grow rapidly and sustainably.The PlanAGOGO Solar is using two key tools to make solar lamps more available than ever before: microfinancing and a direct sales model.Our flexible microfinancing approach allows people to start using their lamp after paying only a small deposit.  They then pay the rest of the lamp off after time through small weekly payments.  Once the lamp is fully paid off, the customer owns it outright and never has to pay for light again for the lifetime of the lamp.  If the customer is unable to continue making payments, they can return the lamp and have their initial deposit refunded.  A flexible payment schedule is negotiated when the lamp is purchased, allowing customers to pay off the lamp quickly or distribute the cost over more time.  Microfinance is a system that has been used and proven throughout the developing world with great success and default rates that are significantly lower than loans in the US.We are also building a network of direct sales representatives who will sell solar lamps to the people who live around them.  Ugandan communities are very close-knit, and trust is an important part of their culture.  As customers see the benefits of solar power, they get excited about the technology and want to share it with their friends and neighbors.  We hope to tap into existing social groups such as women’s organizations, workers’ guilds, and village savings and loan collectives.

I am also an intern at Amphibian Productions, I assist with costume designing and I work full time at a very busy well known hotel. Although its tough I am learning to balance my dreams and reality.

<p>My dream, and to help my dream there is a BIG opportunity in Germany in November. I believe in taking full advantage of every opportunity presented to me. My uncle presented some of my work to an up and coming fashion designer, and she would love to meet me so we can talk about fashion and a possible business proposal. Here’s the kicker, my budget. My budget doesn't agree with my dreams right now, it barely agrees with my reality. I am asking for YOUR help. I would appreciate anything; just a dollar would be a huge blessing. And I am asking for you to share my video and tell a friend or family member; I will forever be grateful. </p>

<h3>Meet Breezing.</h3>
<p>For the first time ever, a metabolism tracker that syncs with your smartphone. Brought to you by a team of dedicated researchers and engineers, Breezing combines innovative design with proven science. </p>
<p><img alt=""Pick a color"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/774152_135821543248595_1842337641_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Vital.</h3>
<p>Metabolism matters.</p>
<p>Your metabolism determines what your body needs just to sustain life. For most people, 70-80% of the calories you burn comes from metabolism - not exercise.</p>
<p>Everyone’s metabolism is different. And your metabolism can change over time. Age, weight, body composition, and hormones are intricately connected to metabolism. That's why tracking your metabolism is so important. </p>
<p><img alt=""Just breathe."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-cache-ec6.pinterest.com/upload/465137467734309987_OqsCvcGu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Knowledge.</h3>
<p>Breezing tells you: </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Your Metabolism REEding</strong></span> (<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>R</strong></span>esting <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>E</strong></span>nergy <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>E</strong></span>xpenditure): The number of calories your metabolism burns everyday</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Your Body's Energy Source</strong></span>: Whether you're burning carbohydrates, fats, or a mix of both</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Your Total Energy Expenditure</span>: </strong>The total number of calories you burn (metabolism + activity level) depending on how active you are.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Your Metabolic History</span>: </strong>Your metabolism over time, so you can see changes easily.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Your Weight History</span>: </strong>Your weight progress, showing you how it corresponds with your metabolism. </p>
<p>                   <img alt=""Know your REEding"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-cache-ec1.pinterest.com/originals/5f/d4/52/5fd452d51d23f6fd817eab85c72ca81a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>(Why does the app look different in the video? Since the filming of the video, we've improved our app's user interface to make it even easier to use.)</em></p>
<h3>Personalized Feedback.</h3>
<p>Based on your unique metabolic profile and individual goals, Breezing gives you diet and exercise advice customized to your needs.</p>
<p>                          <img alt=""advice"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-cache-ec3.pinterest.com/upload/465137467734313803_5bRgL3Vj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3>Connecting + Sharing.</h3>
<p>The Breezing app lets you share results through e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter. You can tell your friends and family how you're doing, or keep your doctor, coach, or trainer updated on your progress.</p>
<h3>Real, Accurate Science.</h3>
<div>
<p>Breezing measures your metabolism using indirect calorimetry, the Gold Standard method preferred by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>While traditional indirect calorimeters are large, bulky, and difficult-to-use, Breezing streamlines indirect calorimetry – so it’s simple, mobile, and effective. </p>
</div>
<p><img alt=""Sensor Magic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-cache-ec6.pinterest.com/originals/96/df/ae/96dfaeb1ea7f6e06ba3c62c0fa8f1953.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><em>All in the sensor</em>.</p>
<div>
<p>Our sensor cartridges are pre-calibrated, ensuring optimal performance. For the utmost accuracy, each cartridge is designed for one REEding and can be disposed after use.</p>
<h3>Portable.</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Anywhere you go, anywhere you want. Breezing syncs to your smartphone or tablet wirelessly, via Bluetooth. </p>
<p><img alt=""anywhere"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-cache-ec5.pinterest.com/upload/465137467734313886_5vlHg9bC.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<h3>Easy-to-use.</h3>
<p>1) Insert sensor cartridge. 2) Breathe. 3) That's it.</p>
<div class=""im"">
<h2><strong>Where We Are </strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt=""close-up"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/775176_135822036581879_1490775778_o.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
</div>
<div>Breezing is a fully functional, working device. Through extensive testing, we've developed and optimized Breezing's state-of-the-art sensor technology, validating the results against gold standard reference methods.  We've also refined Breezing's Android app to achieve the best possible user experience, so that anyone, anywhere, can use Breezing and get accurate results. </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>
<strong>What's Next</strong> </h2>
<p>Our goal is to make Breezing available for everyone. And to do that, we need your help. We’re looking for funds to bring Breezing into mass production and to further develop the app for all mobile platforms. </p>
<div>1. At this time, we've established manufacturing and quality control procedures for the Breezing hardware and sensor cartridges with our manufacturer. We need to prove to the manufacturer there is demand, so we can start large-scale production.</div>
<p> </p>

Meet Breezing.
For the first time ever, a metabolism tracker that syncs with your smartphone. Brought to you by a team of dedicated researchers and engineers, Breezing combines innovative design with proven science. 

 
 
Vital.
Metabolism matters.
Your metabolism determines what your body needs just to sustain life. For most people, 70-80% of the calories you burn comes from metabolism - not exercise.
Everyone’s metabolism is different. And your metabolism can change over time. Age, weight, body composition, and hormones are intricately connected to metabolism. That's why tracking your metabolism is so important. 

Knowledge.
Breezing tells you: 
Your Metabolism REEding (Resting Energy Expenditure): The number of calories your metabolism burns everyday
Your Body's Energy Source: Whether you're burning carbohydrates, fats, or a mix of both
Your Total Energy Expenditure: The total number of calories you burn (metabolism + activity level) depending on how active you are.
Your Metabolic History: Your metabolism over time, so you can see changes easily.
Your Weight History: Your weight progress, showing you how it corresponds with your metabolism. 
                   
(Why does the app look different in the video? Since the filming of the video, we've improved our app's user interface to make it even easier to use.)
Personalized Feedback.
Based on your unique metabolic profile and individual goals, Breezing gives you diet and exercise advice customized to your needs.
                          
Connecting + Sharing.
The Breezing app lets you share results through e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter. You can tell your friends and family how you're doing, or keep your doctor, coach, or trainer updated on your progress.
Real, Accurate Science.

Breezing measures your metabolism using indirect calorimetry, the Gold Standard method preferred by the World Health Organization.
While traditional indirect calorimeters are large, bulky, and difficult-to-use, Breezing streamlines indirect calorimetry – so it’s simple, mobile, and effective. 

All in the sensor.

Our sensor cartridges are pre-calibrated, ensuring optimal performance. For the utmost accuracy, each cartridge is designed for one REEding and can be disposed after use.
Portable.


Anywhere you go, anywhere you want. Breezing syncs to your smartphone or tablet wirelessly, via Bluetooth. 


Easy-to-use.
1) Insert sensor cartridge. 2) Breathe. 3) That's it.

Where We Are 


Breezing is a fully functional, working device. Through extensive testing, we've developed and optimized Breezing's state-of-the-art sensor technology, validating the results against gold standard reference methods.  We've also refined Breezing's Android app to achieve the best possible user experience, so that anyone, anywhere, can use Breezing and get accurate results. 
 

What's Next 
Our goal is to make Breezing available for everyone. And to do that, we need your help. We’re looking for funds to bring Breezing into mass production and to further develop the app for all mobile platforms. 
1. At this time, we've established manufacturing and quality control procedures for the Breezing hardware and sensor cartridges with our manufacturer. We need to prove to the manufacturer there is demand, so we can start large-scale production.
 





2. Breezing is Android-ready, and the next step for us is the iPhone/iPad. Whether it's Android or iOS, we want to make sure that Breezing works seamlessly on all devices.                                            

 
Over the course of the campaign, we’ve received some great feedback. One question that’s been asked a lot: Why isn’t there an iPhone app for Breezing?
 
To our iPhone users, we deeply apologize.
 
We are 100% committed to creating the iOS version for iPhone/iPad – but we need your help to get there.
 
That’s why we’ve added a new perk: B is for Apple. The funds from B is for Apple are specifically earmarked for Breezing’s iPhone/iPad app development. When you contribute $25, you’ll be directly aiding our efforts to develop the Breezing app for iOS. In addition, you’ll receive the Advance Download of the Breezing Demo App for iPhone/iPad as soon as it’s released.  
 
We know how important it is to have the Breezing app available on all platforms. Your support will help us reach that goal. 
What We're Offering
$1.99: Advance Download of the Breezing App for Android (demo mode). Released to you before anyone else.$25:B is for Apple. Advance Download of the Breezing App for iPhone/iPad (demo mode). You want an iPhone/iPad app for Breezing. Well, we do, too. Together, we can make this happen.
$50: BPA-free Stainless Steel Limited Edition Water Bottle. Studies have shown drinking water boosts your metabolism. So, drink up.
$210: Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 with Pre-installed Breezing Demo App. An Android-powered tablet with the Breezing demo app already installed for you.After thoroughly researching the tablets in the market, we've decided to offer our Breezing demo app with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 (8GB). This tablet is the #1 bestseller on Amazon, has consistently received rave reviews, and is powered by the latest Android 4.1, Jelly Bean. (More details here: http://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab/GT-P3113TSYXAR-specs)
$250: Full Breezing Device with 10 Sensor Cartridges, and Breezing App for Android. Be a part of our exclusive first-generation of users.
$450: Full Breezing Device with 10 Sensor Cartridges, plus Android-Powered Tablet with Pre-installed Breezing App. You can have it all.
All of our early adopters will get complete technical support with their Breezing device. We will also continue to supply Breezing cartridges beyond what's included in the perk (see FAQs for pricing information).
Here's a summary:


 NOTE: The Breezing App released this May is for Android. For non-Android users, we offer the Samsung Galaxy tablet (Tab 2.0 7.0, 8GB) with the app pre-installed.
Your Voice Counts: Referral Contest
Our Indiegogo campaign is more than a fundraising effort - it's the chance for us to hear your thoughts, your comments, your suggestions about Breezing. And on Indiegogo, the world's largest open source crowdfunding platform, we hope to hear from as many voices as possible.
You can support us by joining our efforts to spread the message. Simply share Breezing's Indiegogo campaign with anyone you think would be interested. At the end of the campaign, the person who has given us the most referrals will receive the VIP perk: a one-on-one Breezing REEding and consultation with the Breezing founders, including a Breezing device and lifetime support.
It's the least we can do.

FAQs
How much do the sensor cartridges cost?
Each sensor cartridge is $3-5, depending on the quantity ordered. This price reflects the considerable amount of research and labor that goes into every cartridge. To maintain the highest standards of quality, our sensor cartridges undergo rigorous inspection and testing, and are produced here, in the United States.
How does Breezing compare to current indirect calorimetry tests? 
Each additional Breezing measurement is $3-5 (cost of sensor cartridge), while current indirect calorimetry tests are upwards of $40, performed at a facility or clinic.
How frequently should I use Breezing?
Metabolism is closely linked to many factors, such as your intrinsic physiology, your age, and your lifestyle (e.g., diet and exercise). Monitoring metabolism has multiple benefits, but how frequently you should measure metabolism depends on your goal.
If you are a healthy individual that just wants to maintain and monitor your health, once a week may be sufficient.
If you want to adopt a new exercise or metabolism-boosting routine, 4-5 measurements throughout the day may be useful to determine the effects of that routine.
If you were diagnosed with a thyroid disorder and need to start treatment, your metabolism will change with your hormone levels and thyroid gland activity. You may want to consult with your doctors about the frequency of REEding measurements.
If you are a body builder, your metabolism increases with increases in muscle mass, and 1-2 measurements per week may help your training.
Can cartridges be re-used?
Each sensor cartridge is designed for one time use only.
Can my mouthpiece be re-used?
You can re-use your mouthpiece after cleaning.
How long does each REEding measurement take?
Each REEding measurement typically takes between 1 - 1.5 minutes.

<p><strong>A little history…</strong></p>
<p>The Modrobes pant was created in 1996 by Steven Sal Debus as a project for a business course.</p>
<p>Steven wanted a super simple, super comfortable and adjustable lounge pant that you could eat/drink/study and sleep in...</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605228563/ezyjvsm53r9lzteyfwtf.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>So he and and a merry crew traveled around to universities, colleges, events and concerts all over Canada, and even the USA sometimes, selling their unique comfort clothing along the way.</p>
<p>Then the brand exploded in popularity in the late 90’s and every cool kid in Canada seemed to own a pair of the funky pants. The Modrobes “<strong>I want you in my pants</strong>” stickers seemed to be everywhere too. The young company exploded in popularity, opening stores and selling across North America...too big it seemed...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605229309/zm4akxeuusjigolpgc4u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Millions of pairs of pants were sold! </strong></p>
<p>After selling over 2 million pairs of pants and with pressure to make garments in China the company shut down and Steve moved to the mountains of British Columbia.</p>
<p>After 25 years it may be time for the world to experience Modrobes once again.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>We need to make 200 pants to make this project happen. That is 200 * $50 equals $10,000.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get:</strong></h3>
<p>You will get the pants, either the original or fleece, or both pants.</p>
<p>Modrobes was known for having wonderful colors. The more pants we sell in the campaign the more colors will be available.</p>
<p><strong>Why would you want these pants?</strong></p>
<p>Well, if you are 90's kid then you already know why..baggy, adjustable, loungey fun pants with cool colors and 90's nostalgia; every time you put them on you'll travel back in time to when the internet was a baby, Y2K was the scariest issue and cell phones didn't have cameras...plus, the music was awesome!!</p>
<p>If you are not a 90's kid then you are going to get a super simple, adjustable and comfortable pair of ""made in Canada bum around"" lounge pants that will last about 25 years and get softer every time you wash them. Modrobes pants were made with love and we wanted everyone to have a sense of value and belongingness. If you wore our pants we considered you part of our big family. As part of our values we made our garments in Canada so you are also supporting your family, friends and neighbors and not some foreign sweat shop.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If this is your first pair of Modrobes lounge pants they will actually feel a little crispy when you first get them because they are made of a blend of 65/35 poly/cotton. Like a good old school pair of jeans after you wash them a few times they will start to soften nicely into your body...and then 20 years from now you will be hanging out comfortably and someone will say..""Hey, are those modrobes?""..and you'll be like...""damn right they are""...and then you'll feel a warm wave of love wash over your entire body...and only then will we have accomplished our mission.</p>
<p><strong>Perks/Rewards/Styles: (you choose your color, size and style at the end of the campaign)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you buy the 2 Pack or more you can choose either the Lounge or Fleece for any or all of your pants...and the shipping cost will be lower..yes..you guessed it..savings!</p>
<p><strong>The belt buckle adjustment:</strong></p>
<p>Modrobes is known for the easy adjustment belt and buckle. Why? It adjusts every time to your waist..whether that grows or shrinks you will always get the perfect, snug fit.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605638413/ejfkivxublxf2bjvgp2f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>Judging from the feedback and facebook posts the impact of bringing Modrobes back will be an increase of happiness for a lot of people. That's a good reason to do anything. So  If this campaign is successful Steve may actually start up Modrobes again and make more styles. Not sure tho...he's pretty lazy and old these days...but he has a soft spot for Modrobes fans..and he really does still love making people happy by creating comfy clothing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only real challenge is still trying make garments in Canada for an affordable price. But the founder has been making clothing now for over 35 years. He has found a small manufacturer and fabric suppliers to make the pants and he is sampling them now. He has a lengthy career making garments and delivering on crowdfunding campaigns so you can be 1000% sure you will get your pants. Modrobes was like his baby so he does not want to disappoint anyone. Maybe he will even make stickers again..</p>

<p><strong>Returns:</strong> If you don't like the pants after a few test lounges please either return to us(no prob.) or give them to someone who will appreciate them. Every Modrobes pant needs a loving pair of legs and a crotch where they can thrive and spread good will.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping:</strong> Sorry, shipping across Canada is not what we would consider cheap. Canada Post is our only option and we are actually charging a little less than they charge us.</p>
<p>**Oh, If you want to save money on the shipping just double up with a friend, buy more and save on the pant and shipping cost.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share this campaign with anyone who grew up in the 90's and tell those that didn't grow up then what they missed...and how they can get in on it before it's too late.</p>
<p>And thank you...it's been one of the greatest joys of my life to experience the love for Modrobes then and now.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Joey and I'm a business administration student at HEC Montréal. Over the past few years, I've worked as a designer and manufacturing agent. Since I had a good relationship with a textile printer in Mexico, I decided to create a small street wear line by printing my friends' artwork on the fabric I was using to make the samples. I'm hoping to grow a community of artists and offer them the opportunity to create clothing and accessories with their artwork and give them access to an online platform where their products can be purchased. This will allow them to focus on creation without having to worry about production, sales, distribution, etc. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get decent prices with the textile printer, we need to order bigger quantities of fabric. We also need the funds to ship the fabric to Montreal, cover pattern making and production. This is why we need your help to raise $15,000 in order to start the 1st production. In return, you'll get to pick the items of your choice from our lookbook, before they become available for purchase on our website, at 20 to 40% off. You'll also get a discount on your next order on our online store and support talented artists.  </p>
<h3>How to place an order</h3>
<p>Everything we make is unisex, except for leggings (I suppose this is debatable). At this time, we only use 100% polyester fabrics, except for the backpack. Just select the products and print of your choice from the lists below and make sure to indicate them in your order. If you want to add individual items to your order, just add the appropriate amount (as shown in the perks list on the right) and specify it in your order. We couldn't make one sample in each print, so the photos below are just to guide you in the selection of the cut and show what the prints look like.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Here are your options of products:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>T-shirt: standard (small or medium)</li>
<li>T-shirt: low cut (one size fits all)</li>
<li>T-shirt: oversized (one size fits all)</li>
<li>Leggings (small, medium or large)</li>
<li>Hoodies (one size fits all)</li>
<li>Low crotch sweatpants (one size: fits most: xs / s / m)</li>

My name is Joey and I'm a business administration student at HEC Montréal. Over the past few years, I've worked as a designer and manufacturing agent. Since I had a good relationship with a textile printer in Mexico, I decided to create a small street wear line by printing my friends' artwork on the fabric I was using to make the samples. I'm hoping to grow a community of artists and offer them the opportunity to create clothing and accessories with their artwork and give them access to an online platform where their products can be purchased. This will allow them to focus on creation without having to worry about production, sales, distribution, etc. 


What We Need & What You Get
To get decent prices with the textile printer, we need to order bigger quantities of fabric. We also need the funds to ship the fabric to Montreal, cover pattern making and production. This is why we need your help to raise $15,000 in order to start the 1st production. In return, you'll get to pick the items of your choice from our lookbook, before they become available for purchase on our website, at 20 to 40% off. You'll also get a discount on your next order on our online store and support talented artists.  
How to place an order
Everything we make is unisex, except for leggings (I suppose this is debatable). At this time, we only use 100% polyester fabrics, except for the backpack. Just select the products and print of your choice from the lists below and make sure to indicate them in your order. If you want to add individual items to your order, just add the appropriate amount (as shown in the perks list on the right) and specify it in your order. We couldn't make one sample in each print, so the photos below are just to guide you in the selection of the cut and show what the prints look like.
Here are your options of products:

T-shirt: standard (small or medium)
T-shirt: low cut (one size fits all)
T-shirt: oversized (one size fits all)
Leggings (small, medium or large)
Hoodies (one size fits all)
Low crotch sweatpants (one size: fits most: xs / s / m)
Tote bags (small or big)
Clear vinyl & black leather backpack (no prints for this item)

And your options for prints:

mateom-1
mateom-2
Vanya purple
Vanya orange
Vanya pink
Vanya green
Vanya blue

A137-1
A137-2

<h3>Who I Am - A Chinese Calligraphy Lover</h3>
<div>
<p>I am Winfred Hung from Hong Kong. <strong>My hobby is Chinese Calligraphy</strong> which I have learned for more than 10 years. I have participated in several Chinese Calligraphy Exhibitions and have been teaching Calligraphy to secondary school and university students. In recent years, I specialize in Ancient Chinese characters. I am amazed by the beautiful pictogram and the interesting stories behind them.</p>
<p>Everyone has a dream they want to pursue. As a fresh graduate, instead of finding an office job, I am making every effort to achieve my dream: <strong>to promote Ancient <strong>Chinese </strong>characters and Calligraphy to people from all over the world. </strong>And the outcome is<strong> Draword.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>What It Is - A Pioneer to Revitalize Ancient Chinese characters</h3>
<p>Draword's business model is simple: Design pattern, manufacture T-shirt, set up online store and sell. What makes Draword different is the theme. <strong>Draword is probably the first design shop to adopt Ancient <strong>Chinese </strong>characters as its theme. </strong>Ancient Chinese characters are a heritage left by ancestors showing their imagination and wisdom, but sometimes they are difficult to understand. Therefore, the purpose of Draword is to facilitate our understanding of them. Let's look at the examples below.</p>

<h2>What Happened If I Fail to Meet the Goal - Dream still Goes On</h2>
<p>My dream will not stop if the goal cannot be met. I will pay for the manufacturing cost from my wallet(though it is poorly thin). Therefore, as long as there is one person making a contribution for the T-shirt, the T-shirt will be delivered. Of course, your support is definitely not only for me, but also for the spread of Ancient Chinese characters and Calligraphy to everyone who is interested in it.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help - Share!</h2>
<p>Everyone can become critical when someone else asks them to take money out from their own pocket, but you can support me in other ways too. Other than financial support, any support is appreciated! If you like this idea, please share with your friends and family, on Facebook, Twitter and Indiegogo sharing tools!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p>1. What is your academic reference on the explanation of the Ancient Chinese characters?</p>
<p>Draword makes cross-reference from published books and online resources to ensure every designed Cartoon character is based on the most reliable explanation. Other versions of the etymology will be mentioned on the Facebook fan page.</p>
<p>2. Is your business sustainable?</p>
<p>Yes. There are thousands of Chinese characters which can be turned into designs for t-shirts. Currently, I have drafted more than 20 designs. In the long run, Draword will expand its production to a variety of products including greeting cards, cups, phone cases and so on.</p>
<p>3. What are the criteria when you design the Cartoon characters?</p>
<p>The cartoon characters make references to the structure and shape of the ancient characters. Draword does not aim to copy the character, but to highlight the main features of the character in an interesting way.</p>

The front side shows the designed Cartoon character and meaning and the back side displays the original styles of the character. The QR code printed at the corner links to Draword's Facebook fan page where a detailed explanation of the character is provided.
Wearing the T-shirt equals to having a story to tell. Customers are encouraged to share the message of the T-shirt to their friends. The ultimate goal of the design as well as Draword is to let more and more people appreciate the interesting stories behind the Chinese characters.
 
Right now Draword is going to produce its first series of 3 T-shirts.

As for the first T-shirt Boneman, when you look at the explanation of the character below, you might feel like you are having a biology lesson:

Then how about the theme of the last design? Take a guess! The first one who comes up with the correct answer will get that T-shirt for FREE after the campaign!
 
What I need - $ and Support!
I need to raise USD1300 to cover the following costs:

The largest portion of funding will go towards T-shirt manufacturing cost;
Indiegogo process fee and overseas wire cost;
Delivering cost of the perks.

So I am turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, I am offering stylish Ancient Chinese character T-shirt and Calligraphy work. Your contribution will help me produce the first series of products, and further, it will help promote Ancient Chinese characters and Calligraphy to people from all over the world.
 
What You Get - Unique Perks
$5 - Thank you letter
Contribute $5 and you will receive this traditional Chinese style thank you letter that you probably have never received before.
                                  
Left: Envelope  Right: Tang poem  Bottom: Tang Poem (English translation)
The envelope is in traditional Chinese style and all the contents are written in Calligraphy. The name of the addressee will be your Chinese-translated name.
The letter will also be included if you order T-shirt(s) or Calligraphy work.
                         
Want to have a beautiful Chinese Calligraphy? This is your chance!
 
$30(the delivery cost is included) - T-shirt X1
$50(the delivery cost is included) - T-shirt X2
$70(the delivery cost is included) - T-shirt X3
Please refer to the designs above.
 
$100 - Chinese Calligraphy Work (mounted) 74''X19''
                        
The end product will be similar to the one on the left. As for the script, you can choose either Regular Script (left) or Ancient Script (right)
You can provide me the sentence(s) you want me to write. Otherwise, the content will be a Tang Poem. Even if you do not know Chinese, it is ok; you can send me the English one and I will translate it into Chinese.
 
$160 - All in ONE (Thank you letter + 3 T-shirts + Calligraphy work)
 
What Happened If I Fail to Meet the Goal - Dream still Goes On
My dream will not stop if the goal cannot be met. I will pay for the manufacturing cost from my wallet(though it is poorly thin). Therefore, as long as there is one person making a contribution for the T-shirt, the T-shirt will be delivered. Of course, your support is definitely not only for me, but also for the spread of Ancient Chinese characters and Calligraphy to everyone who is interested in it.
 
Other Ways You Can Help - Share!
Everyone can become critical when someone else asks them to take money out from their own pocket, but you can support me in other ways too. Other than financial support, any support is appreciated! If you like this idea, please share with your friends and family, on Facebook, Twitter and Indiegogo sharing tools!
 
FAQ
1. What is your academic reference on the explanation of the Ancient Chinese characters?
Draword makes cross-reference from published books and online resources to ensure every designed Cartoon character is based on the most reliable explanation. Other versions of the etymology will be mentioned on the Facebook fan page.
2. Is your business sustainable?
Yes. There are thousands of Chinese characters which can be turned into designs for t-shirts. Currently, I have drafted more than 20 designs. In the long run, Draword will expand its production to a variety of products including greeting cards, cups, phone cases and so on.
3. What are the criteria when you design the Cartoon characters?
The cartoon characters make references to the structure and shape of the ancient characters. Draword does not aim to copy the character, but to highlight the main features of the character in an interesting way.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Some History</span></h3>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is Miss Tan, owner/creator of Miss Tan Designs and with my Mom, Miss Betty, we are the creators of Puppy Britches. Creativity has always been a part of my family. My Mom has been a seamstress all of her life. When she was younger, she often made clothes without even using a sewing pattern. For years, I hid my creativity skills because I was told it would never get me anywhere. So in my late 20s, I started drawing and creating and haven't been able to stop. We are inspired by the things around us. Of course, Max, our dog, is one of our greatest. We didn't have money to buy a cone, when he was cut by the groomer, so my Mom made him some pants. Puppy Britches was born. With both of our talents, we want to be able give pet owners fashionable alternatives to the cone.</p>
<p><img alt=""Just a Puppy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1344.photobucket.com/albums/p646/zzwesleyt/MaxtheMan0006_zps07223c50.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Our Max as a Puppy""/></p>
<h3>What is Puppy Britches?</h3>
<p>Puppy Britches was created to give pet owners an alternative to the cone. Our dog, like many others, loves to sniff the ground. If he needs to wear a cone for any reason, it inhibits his ability to do everything. When wearing pants, he does not mess with his injury and plus, it allows him to be him. For us, we are adding a little bit of fashion to it with creative patterns and designs.</p>
<p>We are handmade business. Puppy Britches is in its beginning startup phase. We have ideas and passion just not enough funds to do it. </p>
<p>Your contributions towards Puppy Britches will help us down the right path from handmade hobby to a small business in the making.</p>

<p>All funding towards Puppy Britches is going toward us buying the supplies we need to get this line off the ground. My Mom being a professional sewer has worked with some great machines. Her mother's old antique machine is just not up-to-date. I have tons of patterns that I want to bring to life. We need money to get custom fabric. We need a printer that will help us in our designs, shipping, and label process. All other funds is for marketing and any other supplies we may need to help our process go faster. </p>

<b>ABOUT THE PROJECT:</b><br/><div> <div>
<p><b>Hello!</b></p>
<p><b>My name is Ben McPhee and I work for YoYoFactory®.</b></p>
<p><b>We started making yoyos in 2003 and now make a wide range of fine yoyos (even if I do say so myself).</b></p>
<p><b>We started making yoyos because we love yoyos. We still do. We make crazy projects every now and then. YoYoFactory® made the first yoyo to spin for over 20 minutes. We helped make the biggest functioning yoyo in the world and then made the smallest functioning modern performance yoyo. (Shhh… we even have a design with an electro-pulse driven motor for even longer spins.)</b></p>
<p><b>Our objective today isn't so ambitious and its purely selfish. We want fresh new titanium yo-yos to play with.</b></p>
<p><b>That's it. It's simple. Titanium yoyos are pretty cool. Titanium is very strong, allowing us to cut it thinner and achieve extreme weight distribution not possible in more common materials. Its also cool to touch and sounds AMAZING. We have made titanium yoyos before but now we want to make a full-sized competition-ready titanium yoyo. This has never been done on any significant scale.</b></p>
<p><b>We are seeking to raise $20,000. Because this will allow us to order enough to make it affordable to share it with you guys, our friends, and anyone else who like us, wants a new full sized titanium yoyo.</b></p>
<p><b>You want one too? GREAT!</b></p>
<p><b>Let's do this! </b></p>
<p><b>Here is the design.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1305809/files/20150318120207-Dream_Titanium7_03-18-15_-5.JPG?1426705327"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>As drawn, its 65.75gm 56mm in diameter, 43mm wide. In production there might be some minor changes but we will report everything here and to our supporters. The theory with the design is to take advantage of the properties of titanium as a material to deliver maximum performance. Titanium can be machined THIN because it is STRONG so we did that, allowing us to load up the rims. INERTIA in the rims delivers long stable spins. This will have MORE.</b></p>
<p><b>The hardware (other bits in the yoyo) is all standard issue. We will ship with probably a nice CTX bearing, standard CBC large bearing pads, stainless steel axle. While a titanium axle would be nice and are readily available it may bond to the body, so dis-similar metals are needed.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>

<br/><p><b>The timeline starts from when we reach the goal.</b></p>
<p><b>Day 14 later we approve/Revise design based off PROTOTYPES. If you order a prototype, you will be playing with one now also. We can make revisions and this is the only real way delivery time can be delayed, with multiple prototypes, but I don't want a yoyo that isn't amazing.</b></p>
<p><b>When the product is approved production begins and in 6 weeks, YoYos are born. </b></p>
<p><b>Production will be done in CHINA. All supporters yoyo will be air freighted to the USA, where we will conduct a final inspection before shipping to YOU. We will offer a 14 day warranty on any defects too so if you aren't happy with our work, you won't be out of pocket.</b></p>

ABOUT THE PROJECT: 
Hello!
My name is Ben McPhee and I work for YoYoFactory®.
We started making yoyos in 2003 and now make a wide range of fine yoyos (even if I do say so myself).
We started making yoyos because we love yoyos. We still do. We make crazy projects every now and then. YoYoFactory® made the first yoyo to spin for over 20 minutes. We helped make the biggest functioning yoyo in the world and then made the smallest functioning modern performance yoyo. (Shhh… we even have a design with an electro-pulse driven motor for even longer spins.)
Our objective today isn't so ambitious and its purely selfish. We want fresh new titanium yo-yos to play with.
That's it. It's simple. Titanium yoyos are pretty cool. Titanium is very strong, allowing us to cut it thinner and achieve extreme weight distribution not possible in more common materials. Its also cool to touch and sounds AMAZING. We have made titanium yoyos before but now we want to make a full-sized competition-ready titanium yoyo. This has never been done on any significant scale.
We are seeking to raise $20,000. Because this will allow us to order enough to make it affordable to share it with you guys, our friends, and anyone else who like us, wants a new full sized titanium yoyo.
You want one too? GREAT!
Let's do this! 
Here is the design.



As drawn, its 65.75gm 56mm in diameter, 43mm wide. In production there might be some minor changes but we will report everything here and to our supporters. The theory with the design is to take advantage of the properties of titanium as a material to deliver maximum performance. Titanium can be machined THIN because it is STRONG so we did that, allowing us to load up the rims. INERTIA in the rims delivers long stable spins. This will have MORE.
The hardware (other bits in the yoyo) is all standard issue. We will ship with probably a nice CTX bearing, standard CBC large bearing pads, stainless steel axle. While a titanium axle would be nice and are readily available it may bond to the body, so dis-similar metals are needed.





The timeline starts from when we reach the goal.
Day 14 later we approve/Revise design based off PROTOTYPES. If you order a prototype, you will be playing with one now also. We can make revisions and this is the only real way delivery time can be delayed, with multiple prototypes, but I don't want a yoyo that isn't amazing.
When the product is approved production begins and in 6 weeks, YoYos are born. 
Production will be done in CHINA. All supporters yoyo will be air freighted to the USA, where we will conduct a final inspection before shipping to YOU. We will offer a 14 day warranty on any defects too so if you aren't happy with our work, you won't be out of pocket.


You are still in? AWESOME!
You can have one for a super deal if you will support the project. The first 100 people willing to get on board can have one for $200. The retail for this yoyo will be $300 so you will be doing very well for yourself. We also will give you the chance to vote on the name and choose your color (silver or blue).

If 100 people are on board we hit the goal and production will begin!
Just in case 100 people aren't willing to jump, there are some other 'offers' to help get us over the line.

<p>AKT est plus qu’une marque de bijoux : c’est un état
d’esprit, une philosophie. Notre volonté est de transformer des outils de destruction en
armes de séduction, des symboles de violence en symboles de beauté. Nous récupérons les armes auprès d’ONG chargées de désarmer
des zones de conflit. Ces armes sont découpées, transportées, détruites et fondues
jusqu’à disparaître complètement. Nous les faisons ensuite renaître sous forme de bijoux. Une partie de la vente des bijoux est reversée à des ONG de
terrain luttant contre la violence:</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=""notranlsate""></span><blockquote><blockquote><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>« Je suis très attaché à la symbolique de l’arme transformée

violence. »</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></blockquote></blockquote>

« J’ai toujours rêvé de fabriquer de beaux objets. Des objets au design affirmé, que l’on aime et que l’on garde. Des objets qui ont une histoire et qui expriment des valeurs.Il y a 2 ans, j’ai décidé de transformer ce rêve en réalité : c’est ainsi que l’aventure AKT a commencé »
François Ghys, fondateur de AKT Jewels.








DES BIJOUX ENGAGÉS
AKT est plus qu’une marque de bijoux : c’est un état
d’esprit, une philosophie. Notre volonté est de transformer des outils de destruction en
armes de séduction, des symboles de violence en symboles de beauté. Nous récupérons les armes auprès d’ONG chargées de désarmer
des zones de conflit. Ces armes sont découpées, transportées, détruites et fondues
jusqu’à disparaître complètement. Nous les faisons ensuite renaître sous forme de bijoux. Une partie de la vente des bijoux est reversée à des ONG de
terrain luttant contre la violence:« Je suis très attaché à la symbolique de l’arme transformée
en bijoux. Mais je tiens à ce que nous allions au-delà du symbole. Une partie de notre chiffre d’affaires servira donc à
soutenir des ONG de terrain, qui à travers le monde agissent contre la
violence. »



François Ghys, fondateur de AKT Jewels. 





LE DESIGN DES BIJOUX


La première collection a été imaginée par la créatrice de
bijoux Delphine Nardin. Comme elle, les bijoux AKT ont une personnalité forte.
Mélanges de métal et de cordelières, ils associent puissance et souplesse,
caractère et sensualité, élégance et audace. Leur design enveloppant évoque la protection, la carapace. «Ce qui m’a séduite dans le projet c’était le défi de
métamorphoser un métal d’origine un peu «obscure» et qui était assez peu
valorisé dans le monde du bijou, et de lui donner sa noblesse et son
caractère.

Je voulais que cette collection autour de l’acier s’incarne
dans une expression un peu animale, un esprit très matiéré... un peu comme une
carapace, avec des éléments montés sur cordelière. Par ailleurs c’est une
collection qui s’adresse à la fois aux hommes et aux femmes.»


Delphine Nardin, créatrice de la collection.






LA FABRICATION
Les bijoux AKT sont fabriqués de manière artisanale, en France (Ardèche), afin d’obtenir des formes très créatives et une excellente qualité de
produit. 
Le métal d'armes est fondu en laboratoire. Le traitement qu'il
    subit le rend inoxydable et supprime les risques d'allergie. Cette
    préparation permet d'obtenir un métal respectant rigoureusement les normes
    européennes de l'industrie du bijou.





OU LES TROUVER ?


Les bijoux AKT seront commercialisés dès 2014 dans des
concepts stores, des bijouteries et des grands magasins ayant une offre
créateurs. Ils seront proposés également sur internet.
Géographiquement, nous souhaitons commercialiser en Europe,
en Amérique du Nord et au Japon.

A QUOI SERVIRA LA COLLECTE ?




La collecte servira à financer le développement et la fabrication de la première collection de bijoux AKT :
Conception des 20 premières pièces de la collection,
réalisation des maquettes,
transport du métal,
transformation du métal en laboratoire,
fabrication d'exemplaires de pré-séries pour l'action
        commerciale auprès des distributeurs.

Pour financer l'ensemble de ces étapes, nous avons besoin de 20 000 euros minimum. C'est une somme ! Grâce à la plateforme Indiegogo nous avons espoir de donner une réelle impulsion à notre projet.Et si par chance nous
parvenons à recueillir davantage, nous pourrons aussi :
créer du site marchand de la marque,
concevoir et fabriquer le packaging,
élaborer une campagne et des outils de communication,
participer aux salons

LES PIECES A COMMANDER MAINTENANT POUR NOUS SOUTENIR


Nous souhaitons vous faire partager cette aventure riche de sens, pour ce faire nous vous proposons d’acquérir en avant-première une série d’objets vous permettant de découvrir l’univers AKT.
Les pièces commandées lors de la collecte seront envoyées à
leurs heureux propriétaires en Février.
D’avance merci pour votre soutien, nous avons hâte de
pouvoir honorer nos premières commandes !

A CHILD'S DREAM

“I have always dreamed of making beautiful things. Objects of striking design, that we love and keep. Objects which have a story and which express certain values. Two years ago, I decided to make this dream a reality: and so the AKT adventure began.”
François Ghys, founder of AKT jewels




COMMITED JEWELRY

AKT is more than just a jewellery brand: it is a state of mind, a philosophy. Our desire is to transform tools of destruction into weapons of seduction, symbols of violence into symbols of beauty. We collect the weapons through the NGO’s in charge of disarming war zones. These weapons are dismantled, transported, destroyed and then melted down until they disappear completely. We then recreate them as jewellery. Part of the  sales is donated to the field NGO’s fighting against violence.
“I am very attached to the symbolism of a weapon transformed into jewellery. But I want it to be more than just a symbol. Part of our turnover will be used to support field NGO’s who are acting against violence all over the world.”
François Ghys, founder of AKT jewels


JEWELRY DESIGN

This first collection has been conceived by jewellery designer Delphine Nardin. Much like her, AKT jewellery has a strong personality. A mix of metal and drawstrings, the pieces combine power with versatility, character with sensuality, elegance with daring. Their wrap around design evokes ideas of protection, of armour.
“What drew me into the project was the challenge of transforming metal with a dark history, which holds very little value within the jewellery world, and giving it its own dignity and character.I wanted this collection based around steel to manifest itself into a raw work and expression, a very material based state…almost like armour, with the elements assembled on a drawstring. In addition, it is a collection aimed at both men and women.”
Delphine Nardin, designer for the collection






MANUFACTURE

AKT jewellery is created using artisanal methods, in France (Ardèche), in order to produce highly creative items of excellent quality.The metal from the weapons is melted down in a lab. It undergoes a treatment which renders it stainless and eliminates any risk of allergy. This preparation allows us to obtain a metal which strictly adheres to the European standards of the jewellery industry.





WHERE CAN I FIND THEM ?

AKT jewellery will be on sale as of 2014 in concept stores, jewellery stores and certain department stores who promote designers. They will also be available online.In terms of placement, we hope to be active in Europe, North America and Japan.



WHAT IS THE FUND-RAISING FOR ?

The aim of the fund-raising is to finance the development and manufacture of the first AKT collection:
Designing the first 20 pieces of the collection
Creation of the prototypes
Transporting the metal

</div></div>","Our Back Story 


In 2005, Canadian blogger Kyle MacDonald set out on a mission to get himself a new house starting with just a red paper clip. He began by trading that paper clip for a pen, and then the pen for a door knob, and the door knob for a camping stove, until eventually he traded a role in a movie for a house. Taking him nearly a year to complete, it’s a story that would make the entrepreneur in all of us a little jealous.Now imagine if we could put that idea to work for social change in Tampa Bay. A group of graduate students in the entrepreneurship program at USF have ventured out to do just that. What started out as a class project to start a business with merely a paper clip as our only startup capital has snowballed into a movement to change the way we think about charity and raise money for local organizations in the process. The One Paper Clip Fund aims to raise one cent for every resident in Tampa Bay.


   
Helping Those Who Need It Most



1 in 4 children in the state of Florida are living in poverty. In the Tampa Bay area alone there is somewhere around 200,000 children who don’t know where their next meal will come from, and about 5,000 are living in foster care as victims of neglect or abuse. These kids find themselves in these situations and they have no control over it. What happens when they get sick? How can we help them see a better future?
Thankfully there are amazing local charities doing important work to alleviate problems associated with child hunger, homelessness, abuse, and illness. We have teamed up with a group of local children's charities who have a history of providing unique and powerful programs and services to our area's at risk youth. Our partner organizations are:



A Kid's Place of Tampa Bay


Feeding America Tampa Bay


Big Brothers Big Sisters Tampa Bay


Ronald McDonald House Charities of Tampa Bay


Champions for Children



Your Change Can Make Change

Tired of aching feet and spending countless hours trying on shoes, we set off on a journey to find a solution.</p><ul><li>The <b>PROBLEM</b> is <b>STANDARD SIZING</b>. Shoes today use a ""one size fits all"" approach by using a single 2-dimensional measurement, the foot length, to approximate the fit of a shoe. The problem with this method is that it <b>IGNORES</b> the varying shapes, girths, and other 3-dimensional attributes of a person's foot. </li></ul><ul><li>
<b>BESPOKE</b> is the answer but is expensive, hard to find, require multiple appointments, and can take up to 6-8 months. </li></ul><ul><li>The <b>SOLUTION</b> is MADE. We're bringing bespoke to the digital age by offering a smartphone 3D foot scanner app, taking orders online, and delivering our shoes to your doorstep. </li></ul><p>Gone are the days of <b>COMPROMISING</b> between quality, style, and fit.  </p><ul>
<li>QUALITY CONSTRUCTION - Each pair is HANDMADE and takes over 200 steps &amp; 20+ man hours. </li>
<li>BUILT TO LAST - most shoes are glued together. Ours are hand stitched allowing them to be resoled</li>
<li>PREMIUM CALFSKIN - We only source leathers derived from top quality European rawhides</li>
<li>CUSTOM FIT - Standard sizing ignores individual anatomy. We take a combination of 14 measurements to develop a fit that follows the natural shape of your feet.</li>
<li>VERTICALLY INTEGRATED - We own our factory.  This allows us to offer high quality shoes at a fraction of the cost of traditional bespoke. </li>

Tired of aching feet and spending countless hours trying on shoes, we set off on a journey to find a solution.The PROBLEM is STANDARD SIZING. Shoes today use a ""one size fits all"" approach by using a single 2-dimensional measurement, the foot length, to approximate the fit of a shoe. The problem with this method is that it IGNORES the varying shapes, girths, and other 3-dimensional attributes of a person's foot. 
BESPOKE is the answer but is expensive, hard to find, require multiple appointments, and can take up to 6-8 months. The SOLUTION is MADE. We're bringing bespoke to the digital age by offering a smartphone 3D foot scanner app, taking orders online, and delivering our shoes to your doorstep. Gone are the days of COMPROMISING between quality, style, and fit.  
QUALITY CONSTRUCTION - Each pair is HANDMADE and takes over 200 steps & 20+ man hours. 
BUILT TO LAST - most shoes are glued together. Ours are hand stitched allowing them to be resoled
PREMIUM CALFSKIN - We only source leathers derived from top quality European rawhides
CUSTOM FIT - Standard sizing ignores individual anatomy. We take a combination of 14 measurements to develop a fit that follows the natural shape of your feet.
VERTICALLY INTEGRATED - We own our factory.  This allows us to offer high quality shoes at a fraction of the cost of traditional bespoke. 


​SCAN IN UNDER 5 MINUTES.SCAN REQUIREMENTS
MADE Scan Kit
MADE Scan App (iOS)
A helping hand
Backers will receive a Scan Kit containing a pair of specially designed socks which must be worn during the scanning process.  The MADE Scan App will guide you through your first scan with step-by-step instructions and an easy to follow video.  Scan your feet in the comfort of your own home in under 5 minutes.  No shoemaker necessary.  The MADE experience takes personalization to a new level. We offer a variety of customization options allowing you to create a one of a kind pair that's unique to you.
4 upper colors (black, [patina:] oxblood, dark brown, brown)
3 lining colors (black, brown, tan)
2 outsole colors (black, red)
2 outsole options (half-rubber/half leather, full leather)
2 Toe shapes (smart round, soft square)
Monogram option on outsole: up to 3 letters



TOE SHAPES
OUTSOLE COLORS & MONOGRAMS
Half Rubber OutsoleTwo weeks after submitting your scan, you’ll receive a pair of prototype shoes to check the fit. In the situation where a major revision is required, another pair of prototype shoes will be made.  From our experience, one fitting is usually enough.  After a good fit is confirmed, you'll receive your final shoes in 4-6 weeks. Because we have your fit on file, subsequent orders will skip the fitting stage and go straight to production.
HAND WELTED CONSTRUCTIONSynonymous with quality and tradition, this technique has remained the same for over 100 years and is used by only a handful of high-end brands.DIRECT TO CONSUMERBy bringing production in house and taking orders online, we cut out the middle men and relay the savings to you. OUR STORYAfter working with over 20 manufacturers in 4 countries, we realized that nobody was willing to adopt the level of customization and quality that we wanted.  In order to get it right, we needed to do ourselves. We invested in our own facility and assembled a team of master craftsmen in Guangzhou, China, the largest footwear producing city in the world.4"" BEECH WOOD SHOE HORNWe're a small team with big goals.  Although we've made tons of progress, setting up our manufacturing facility was only the first piece of the puzzle.  We've bootstrapped our vision of revolutionizing the bespoke shoe industry to this point, but now we need your help to piece the rest together.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>THE VISION</strong></h3>
<p>It's often said, ""Necessity is the Mother of invention."" You see I wear a perfect size 12 shoe.  I would find myself running from where the sun rises to where it sets to find a shoe and still arrive home empty handed. This was very frustrating to me - the difficulty of trying to find fashionable and affordable shoes in my size.  During a telephone conversation with a good friend, I shared my frustration and she in turn saw my vision and commented,  ""If you opened your own store, your search would be over.""</p>
<p>Armed with my experience, which encompasses more than 10 years in retail, sales, and marketing, I began to do my homework.  My expertise in fashion and merchandising assisted me in my journey to find as many plus size shoe suppliers as humanly possible.  In this time, I've consulted with many industry advisors, crunched numbers, met with a retail attorney, and attended countless conferences and seminars.  These steps were essential to establishing a business plan that is solid, and today I feel more than ready to make this company a reality - a raging success</p>

<h3><strong>THE GOAL</strong></h3>
<p>Calee's goal is to be the shoe shopping destination of choice for style-conscious women who appreciate value and wear a larger size shoe.</p>
<p>Imagine a store where everyone knows your name. A store where you could have the services of your very own personal shopper.</p>
<p>A store where you could have as little or as much attention as you'd like.  Imagine a store that you could feel was exclusively yours!</p>
<p>100% of funds raised will be allocated towards the Opening of Calee's Shoes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Store construction and design - Interior Design and decorating cost, fixtures, displays, showcases, shelves/racks etc.</li>
<li>Fees and Permits - Licenses, permits and merchant account fees (for accepting and processing credit cards)</li>
<li>Promotion Expenses - Store signage, advertising and promotion for launch, visuals.</li>
<li>Operating Expenses - Opening inventory and bags with company logo.</li>
<li>Administrative Cost - Office supplies, cleaning supplies, miscellanous</li>
<li>Equipment - Point of Sale systems (Credit Card and check processing machines. Bar code reader, cash drawer, POS software ect.) Security Cameras.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>MAKING A DIFFERENCE</strong></p>
<p>The majority of shoe stores today are overwhelmingly focused on women who wear sizes 6 through 10. While this focus is relevant for the needs of most buyers, it tends to overlook and downplay the important needs of buyers whose sizes extend beyond the so-called norm. So, what about us? </p>
<p>Today, the ability for the woman who wears a size 11, 12 or 13 shoe to walk into a shoe store and request her size is nearly impossible. Although the shoe industry has expanded rapidly in the past several years, it has failed to realize and catch up with the fact that people are getting taller and heavier, <span style="""">and their feet are keeping pace - </span>as they have for generations. </p>
<p>According to the Professional Shoe Fitting Manual, in the 1960s, the average American adult female shoe was a 5.5 or 6; in the '80s it had reached 8 or 8.5.  <strong>Today 37% of women in our society wear a size 9 shoe or above.</strong></p>
<p><strong>United We Can Make A Difference</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>No more shopping on-line and hoping the shoe will fit</strong></em>.  Calee's will deliver an incredible buying experience with an unmatched extensive selection of shoes for women who wear sizes 9 through 13.  My mission is to redefine the shoe shopping experience for we women who leave a larger footprint - to provide an unmatched selection of shoes that will create more opportunities to look and feel absolutely gorgeous!</p>
<p>Together we can make change!  IT'S ABOUT TIME.</p>

Imagine a store where everyone knows your name. A store where you could have the services of your very own personal shopper.
A store where you could have as little or as much attention as you'd like.  Imagine a store that you could feel was exclusively yours!
100% of funds raised will be allocated towards the Opening of Calee's Shoes.

Store construction and design - Interior Design and decorating cost, fixtures, displays, showcases, shelves/racks etc.
Fees and Permits - Licenses, permits and merchant account fees (for accepting and processing credit cards)
Promotion Expenses - Store signage, advertising and promotion for launch, visuals.
Operating Expenses - Opening inventory and bags with company logo.
Administrative Cost - Office supplies, cleaning supplies, miscellanous
Equipment - Point of Sale systems (Credit Card and check processing machines. Bar code reader, cash drawer, POS software ect.) Security Cameras.

 
MAKING A DIFFERENCE
The majority of shoe stores today are overwhelmingly focused on women who wear sizes 6 through 10. While this focus is relevant for the needs of most buyers, it tends to overlook and downplay the important needs of buyers whose sizes extend beyond the so-called norm. So, what about us? 
Today, the ability for the woman who wears a size 11, 12 or 13 shoe to walk into a shoe store and request her size is nearly impossible. Although the shoe industry has expanded rapidly in the past several years, it has failed to realize and catch up with the fact that people are getting taller and heavier, and their feet are keeping pace - as they have for generations. 
According to the Professional Shoe Fitting Manual, in the 1960s, the average American adult female shoe was a 5.5 or 6; in the '80s it had reached 8 or 8.5.  Today 37% of women in our society wear a size 9 shoe or above.
United We Can Make A Difference
No more shopping on-line and hoping the shoe will fit.  Calee's will deliver an incredible buying experience with an unmatched extensive selection of shoes for women who wear sizes 9 through 13.  My mission is to redefine the shoe shopping experience for we women who leave a larger footprint - to provide an unmatched selection of shoes that will create more opportunities to look and feel absolutely gorgeous!
Together we can make change!  IT'S ABOUT TIME.

<div>My name Is Spencer, i'm a Highschool student looking to make a dream come true. Legacy Supply Co, that's my clothing lines name. I wanted to make a clothing brand for several years when I first went into Highschool, I now finally made a move on it after time to think and come up with ideas. I came up with Legacy to use because it sounded like a good Sportswear/Streetwear clothing name. I did it because I was sick of seeing clothing lines from places like PacSun and Tillys always having the same look and designs. Another reason I did it was because I hated paying 35 40 dollars just for a hat and 65$ for a sweatshirt. Now I've came here to ask for your help to help me achieve my dream in making a clothing line.</div> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What we need is $1,000 USD. The money is going to the funding of supplies as in the sweatshirts, hats and other things needed to start an inventory for people to start buying things and for the website to make it a user friendly and a good website for people to browse. The perks for you guys are amazing! The 5$ one is just a thank you written on our page with your name on it. The 10$ one is a VIP thank you which you are above all the 5$ donors on that page. Getting to the good stuff with a 25$ Donation you get a Legacy embroidered snapback, For 40$ you get a Legacy logoed Sweatshirt and for 60$ Get the both of them !.</p>
<p>If the funding is not completed it will still go to the things I have said it will go to, and the people that did help fund will still receive their things that they donated to get.  </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This means a lot to me to be able to start my own clothing line. I want to later down the road either open my own store with my clothing or get it to be sold in stores.</p>
<p>It will impact the clothing industry because teens/young adults who want to have that streetwear/sportswear look in their life can with the not as expensive clothing!</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Some risks and obstacles we might run into are getting the clothing in on time from being shipped from the warehouses or getting them shipped to you on time.

</div><p>Two remarkable discoveries of quantum physics involve the phenomena of entanglement and non-local communication.  Entanglement is the observation that a quantum particle, such as a photon, can be split into two particles that share the same quantum state.  Thus quantities such as momentum are conserved between them, even if the particles are far apart.  Although Albert Einstein was one of the founders of quantum theory, he was one of its harshest critics and considered it to be, if not wrong, then incomplete.  To that end he, with two colleges, published a thought experiment in which he illustrated what is known as the EPR Paradox, which anticipated the complexities of quantum entanglement by postulating that under that circumstance, the entangled particles would have to communicate with each other instantaneously (in other words, much faster than light, or superluminally), which was forbidden by the theory of relativity.  Einstein called this “spooky action at a distance.”</p><p>The concept of non-local communication, or communication between particles not in physical contact or proximity, has been demonstrated by the violation of Bell’s inequality, which showed that particles do not have defined properties, such as momentum, until they are measured.  Thus the measurement of a property of one entangled particle in one side of the universe somehow affects the same property in the other entangled particle on the other side of the universe.  Most scientists dismiss this as mere correlation, since observers on the two sides cannot compare each other’s results other than by classical means at a finite speed.  Thus it is not believed that any actual communication is transmitted instantly by entanglement, since any transfer of information involves the transfer of energy, which must obey relativistic physics and travel subliminally. </p><p>In 1998, however, an unpublished doctoral thesis by the Austrian Birgit Dopfer indicated that instant communication over a distance may be possible.  In an experiment, Dopfer generated entangled photons.  One set passed through a double slit to create the familiar interference pattern.  The other set was measured to determine which slit the first set passed through.  Whether one set was measured or not appeared to affect whether the other set exhibited an interference pattern or not, mimicking, over distance, the well-known phenomenon of photon wave/particle duality first observed by Thomas Young in the 19th century.  If Dopfer’s experiment can be confirmed, it demonstrates a new form of entanglement that goes beyond mere correlation and implies that instant, non-local energy-less communication is possible.</p><p>So if superluminal communication is possible, can that be the basis for retrocausal signaling, or actually transmitting information back in time?      Again, most scientists state that this is not possible.  Experiments, however, have demonstrated that at the quantum level, the arrow of time appears to travel in both directions.  This has been shown by so-called “quantum eraser” experiments, in which one entangled object appears to communicate with its twin backward in time so that the experimenter has the luxury of actually erasing a past event (see Kim, Yoon-Ho; R.
