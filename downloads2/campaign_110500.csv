<h2>HI, My name is Chris Torres and I am creating a marketing book and online course specifically for tours and activity businesses.</h2>
<p>Lookers to Bookers will not be just another general marketing book. It will be a crystallisation of 26 years of marketing knowledge, and 13 years in the tourism marketing sector, into one practical resource, giving you the specialist tools you need to market your tours and activity business.</p>
<p>Many marketing books are great at saying what you should do but they often don’t provide you with the tools to actually make practical changes. This often leaves business owners disheartened and frustrated, and they tend to give up after a few weeks of trying to reinvigorate their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Lookers to Bookers will, of course, advise you on what you should be doing, but it will also include practical worksheets and guides to help you take your newly acquired insight and turn it into an increased customer base and, ultimately, increased revenue. Each section will also be accompanied by online videos revisiting and reinforcing how the advice I provide can be used to improve your tours and activity business.</p>
<p>To help you, the book will follow the progress of a fictional tour company, showing you the company’s performance at each stage. This, I hope, will make it easier for the reader to envisage their own business in the same position, going on a similar journey.</p>
<h3>The Book - Lookers to Bookers</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547123976/yl2rppqnobo2wlfpfans.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The book will consist of 10 sections…</p>
<p><strong>Section One</strong> will contain the introductions and an overview of the book, as well as a forward from a well respected influencer from our industry. I can’t wait to announce who this is.</p>
<p><strong>Section Two</strong> is entitled “Who Do you Think You Are?”. This section will contain a brand workshop that will help you and your team find out where your business currently sits and the path you should take to grow your business. If you are just starting up a tour business, then this section is one of the first steps you should take.</p>
<p>I will help you find your brand voice and personality, helping you to create a consistent message across all your media outlets.</p>
<p>I will even advise on how you should create, or change, your brand logo.</p>
<p><strong>Section Three</strong> is called  “Laying The Foundations”. These are the things you need in place before you think about marketing your business.</p>
<p>This section will cover many elements, looking at how to build a lead generating website, selecting the right booking system for your needs, the best practices for setting up your social media and TripAdvisor, and whether you should use an Online Travel Agent.</p>
<p><strong>Section Four</strong>, as yet untitled, will cover how you can research your destination, sector, your competitors and customers, all of which helps you know who you should target and how you should market yourself to this target audience.</p>
<p><strong>Section Five</strong>, the biggest section in the book, is titled “Building A Content Strategy”. With this section, I will provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to create streams of content to use across all marketing channels. I will even help you create 90 days of content ideas in 1 day!</p>
<p>I will cover topics such as Video Strategies, How to build your email lists legally (and responsibly), and even how you should implement a phone strategy.</p>
<p>This section will also show you how you can create a super successful Facebook campaign for only $5 per day.</p>
<p><strong>Section Six</strong> is called “Setting The Budget and it covers a question I get asked a lot… “what should my marketing budget be”. I will give you a formula I use when advising the many businesses I work with each year.</p>
<p><strong>Section Seven</strong>, titled “Implementation”, provides you with the tools and knowhow to implement your strategies, including when and how to post new content.</p>
<p><strong>Section Eight</strong>, is called “Report. Review. Repeat.” I will explain how you can look over the data you collect and how to use it to further refine your marketing strategies and grow your business.</p>
<p><strong>Section Nine</strong>, is called “Now… Go, Do.” I provide some final advice and some further steps that you should consider.</p>
<p><strong>Section Ten</strong> is our handy resource section where you can view, download and visit all the information and companies I mention in the book.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, each section will also be accompanied by online videos, so you can take in the information at a rate that suits you, helping you fully understand how the advice I provide can be used within your tour and activity business.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547138076/h8kulw0plkcjwl9ktsod.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Webinar Course</h3>
<p>Not only will I be producing a book with accompanying videos, I will be diving deeper into each subject by creating an online course that you can follow at your leisure. The course will guide you further on the path to growing your business and generating more revenue.</p>
<p>The course covers many aspects of digital marketing — from branding to SEO, and everything in between. It is ideal for start-ups and small to medium-sized businesses who have their own marketing teams, or business owners who want to tackle these aspects themselves. You will also receive all new course updates and access to future additions.</p>
<p>Includes a 1-hour consultation with the TMA team.</p>
<p>More details on this will be available soon.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be self published. I believe it will become an important resource that will help tour and activity businesses improve their marketing practices. I set up these pledges to help with the costs associated with self-publishing this book. Money raised will go towards the print and publication costs, purchasing ISBN numbers for the hardback, paperback and digital copies. It will also help cover the initial test print copies before fully going into production.</p>
<p>By funding in advance, you will also receive the book for less that its retail price.</p>
<p><strong>I am also offering some exclusive incentives for pledges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Your tour and activity business name, web address and short description could be added to the resources section of the book for every edition published now or in the future.</li>
<li>You could receive a 2-hour conference workshop with me where we discuss any marketing topic you wish.</li>
<li>You could be entitled to a full 2-day workshop with myself and one of my team.</li>
<li>You could be part of a VIP boardroom level group of only 12 people, with access to me, my team and some of my strategic partners, all with the aim of helping you grow your business.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you can help me raise the funds required to publish this book. With a little marketing guidance, you could reach your own business goals… turning those lookers in revenue-generating bookers!</p>

<h3>About Chris</h3>
<p>I have 26 years’ experience working in brand development and marketing, and I’ve spent the last 13 years running my own marketing company, the Tourism Marketing Agency.</p>
<p>My client base is truly international, with around 80% of clients based outside of the UK, where I am based. I have worked with some of the biggest players in the industry, including Gray Line – the oldest and largest sightseeing company in the world.</p>
<p>I have helped clients all over Europe, The Americas, Asia, and even Antarctica! This broad range of clients has been challenging and exciting; it has helped me and my team develop considerable knowledge and expertise in a huge variety of different destinations and tourism markets.</p>
<p>I have won numerous awards over the years, such as Best Marketing Agency, Best Tourism Website and Businessman of the Year in 2018. I have also had the pleasure of speaking at numerous tourism events, such as Arival, the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Travel Massive, several Gray Line conferences, and Landing Madrid.</p>
<p>I have lived and breathed marketing for the tours and activities sector for years and this book is my attempt to compile what I’ve learned into a practical resource for anyone who needs some help turning their own lookers into bookers.</p>
<h3>Publish Date</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I am looking to finish and publish the book in April 2019 with the course following shortly after. Two of the 10 sections have been written and I am already sitting at 10,000 words (not including worksheets). This will be a large book full of practical advice that I know will help grow your business.</p>
<p>The only risk I see is the publish date may slip a little but I am confident this will not happen as I am accumulating, refining and re-writing many years of knowledge.</p>

<h3>Excerpt from Intro:</h3>
<p>The story I am about to tell is a personal one. A true story, so bare with me. It helps set the tone as to why I feel this book is a must for all tours and activity businesses.</p>
<p>Ever since primary school I have always had a love of Japan. Its history, its culture and its people. In-fact, I have my father to thank for that one.</p>
<p>Our class was assigned to create a mood board to present to the class of any point in history we decided to talk about. I could see my fellow classmates were already deciding on your typical topics such as the world wars or ancient Egypt (this was standard back in the 1980’s), but I wanted to do something different.</p>
<p>After getting home I walked into our lounge and started to flick through my father’s books. This was pre-internet! He was an avid book reader and subscribed to the Reader’s Digest (Is this still a thing?*) which delivered a set of books each month to our door. Once of the books instantly caught my eye.</p>
<p>My Father just received a book on the ancient history of Japan. It had an image of a Samurai warrior on the cover, something I had never seen before but immediately sparked my imagination, and my love for all things Japanese.</p>
<p>Fast forward 25 year and my wife and I decided we wanted to start a family but before we did, wanted to take a ‘once in a lifetime’ trip to somewhere special. It was a choice between Canada and Japan. Suffice to say, Japan won and we set out looking to see what we could do over our planned 2 week trip.</p>
<p>We knew we wanted to to travel across Japan and see as much as we could so, after a quick Google search, we found one company who felt could deliver what we wanted. Why did we decide this? Simple… content.</p>
<p>You see, this company went to great lengths to create good content through video, with most being presented by their own tour guides. I cannot stress enough how important this is. You could see the passion and enthusiasm the guides had for a land they obviously loved.</p>
<p>One such guide, Tyler Palmer, helped the most in selling the various sights we could see in destination. One of these sights would be witnessing the sunrise at the top of Mt Fuji. “Not a chance” was my first thought. Although we are fairly fit and healthy individuals, there is no way we could climb Mt Fuji. We are not ‘athletes’.</p>
<p>After a quick phone call with the company (yes, we spoke to someone… more on this later in the book), we were assured that, although there was no guarantees, we should be able to reach the top of Mt Fuji barring any server altitude sickness.</p>
<p>With this, and with the other sights we did not wish to pass up on, we extended our stay from 2 weeks to nearly a month.</p>
<p>When we finally arrived at Narita Airport we were met by none other than Tyler Palmer, the guide from the videos. Because we saw his videos, meeting him at the airport was like meeting an old friend. It broke the ice and made us feel instantly welcome.</p>
<p>Our time in Japan was a first class experience. We travelled around Japan, visiting many cities and towns, meeting locals and eating some of the best food I have ever had. The sense of accomplishment we also felt when we finally reached the top of Mt Fuji will be with us forever. And the view at the top… stunning.</p>
<p>At time of writing this book, nearly 12 years on, we have recommended that business, and Tyler, on many occasions. We are also still friends with Tyler and keep in communication through Facebook. He now has a young family himself.</p>
<p>The reason I am telling you all this, and incase you have missed the point, the real value to that business was not just our time spent in Japan, but the relationships and recommendations we have made many years later. Hey, I am still sharing my experience with you now.</p>
<p>All off the back on one peice of video marketing, we:</p>
<ul>

</div></div>","HI, My name is Chris Torres and I am creating a marketing book and online course specifically for tours and activity businesses.
Lookers to Bookers will not be just another general marketing book. It will be a crystallisation of 26 years of marketing knowledge, and 13 years in the tourism marketing sector, into one practical resource, giving you the specialist tools you need to market your tours and activity business.
Many marketing books are great at saying what you should do but they often don’t provide you with the tools to actually make practical changes. This often leaves business owners disheartened and frustrated, and they tend to give up after a few weeks of trying to reinvigorate their marketing efforts.
Lookers to Bookers will, of course, advise you on what you should be doing, but it will also include practical worksheets and guides to help you take your newly acquired insight and turn it into an increased customer base and, ultimately, increased revenue. Each section will also be accompanied by online videos revisiting and reinforcing how the advice I provide can be used to improve your tours and activity business.
To help you, the book will follow the progress of a fictional tour company, showing you the company’s performance at each stage. This, I hope, will make it easier for the reader to envisage their own business in the same position, going on a similar journey.
The Book - Lookers to Bookers

The book will consist of 10 sections…
Section One will contain the introductions and an overview of the book, as well as a forward from a well respected influencer from our industry. I can’t wait to announce who this is.
Section Two is entitled “Who Do you Think You Are?”. This section will contain a brand workshop that will help you and your team find out where your business currently sits and the path you should take to grow your business. If you are just starting up a tour business, then this section is one of the first steps you should take.
I will help you find your brand voice and personality, helping you to create a consistent message across all your media outlets.
I will even advise on how you should create, or change, your brand logo.
Section Three is called  “Laying The Foundations”. These are the things you need in place before you think about marketing your business.
This section will cover many elements, looking at how to build a lead generating website, selecting the right booking system for your needs, the best practices for setting up your social media and TripAdvisor, and whether you should use an Online Travel Agent.
Section Four, as yet untitled, will cover how you can research your destination, sector, your competitors and customers, all of which helps you know who you should target and how you should market yourself to this target audience.
Section Five, the biggest section in the book, is titled “Building A Content Strategy”. With this section, I will provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to create streams of content to use across all marketing channels. I will even help you create 90 days of content ideas in 1 day!
I will cover topics such as Video Strategies, How to build your email lists legally (and responsibly), and even how you should implement a phone strategy.
This section will also show you how you can create a super successful Facebook campaign for only $5 per day.
Section Six is called “Setting The Budget and it covers a question I get asked a lot… “what should my marketing budget be”. I will give you a formula I use when advising the many businesses I work with each year.
Section Seven, titled “Implementation”, provides you with the tools and knowhow to implement your strategies, including when and how to post new content.
Section Eight, is called “Report. Review. Repeat.” I will explain how you can look over the data you collect and how to use it to further refine your marketing strategies and grow your business.
Section Nine, is called “Now… Go, Do.” I provide some final advice and some further steps that you should consider.
Section Ten is our handy resource section where you can view, download and visit all the information and companies I mention in the book.
As mentioned previously, each section will also be accompanied by online videos, so you can take in the information at a rate that suits you, helping you fully understand how the advice I provide can be used within your tour and activity business.

The Webinar Course
Not only will I be producing a book with accompanying videos, I will be diving deeper into each subject by creating an online course that you can follow at your leisure. The course will guide you further on the path to growing your business and generating more revenue.
The course covers many aspects of digital marketing — from branding to SEO, and everything in between. It is ideal for start-ups and small to medium-sized businesses who have their own marketing teams, or business owners who want to tackle these aspects themselves. You will also receive all new course updates and access to future additions.
Includes a 1-hour consultation with the TMA team.
More details on this will be available soon.

What We Need & What You Get
This book will be self published. I believe it will become an important resource that will help tour and activity businesses improve their marketing practices. I set up these pledges to help with the costs associated with self-publishing this book. Money raised will go towards the print and publication costs, purchasing ISBN numbers for the hardback, paperback and digital copies. It will also help cover the initial test print copies before fully going into production.
By funding in advance, you will also receive the book for less that its retail price.
I am also offering some exclusive incentives for pledges:

Your tour and activity business name, web address and short description could be added to the resources section of the book for every edition published now or in the future.
You could receive a 2-hour conference workshop with me where we discuss any marketing topic you wish.
You could be entitled to a full 2-day workshop with myself and one of my team.
You could be part of a VIP boardroom level group of only 12 people, with access to me, my team and some of my strategic partners, all with the aim of helping you grow your business.

I hope you can help me raise the funds required to publish this book. With a little marketing guidance, you could reach your own business goals… turning those lookers in revenue-generating bookers!

About Chris
I have 26 years’ experience working in brand development and marketing, and I’ve spent the last 13 years running my own marketing company, the Tourism Marketing Agency.
My client base is truly international, with around 80% of clients based outside of the UK, where I am based. I have worked with some of the biggest players in the industry, including Gray Line – the oldest and largest sightseeing company in the world.
I have helped clients all over Europe, The Americas, Asia, and even Antarctica! This broad range of clients has been challenging and exciting; it has helped me and my team develop considerable knowledge and expertise in a huge variety of different destinations and tourism markets.
I have won numerous awards over the years, such as Best Marketing Agency, Best Tourism Website and Businessman of the Year in 2018. I have also had the pleasure of speaking at numerous tourism events, such as Arival, the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Travel Massive, several Gray Line conferences, and Landing Madrid.
I have lived and breathed marketing for the tours and activities sector for years and this book is my attempt to compile what I’ve learned into a practical resource for anyone who needs some help turning their own lookers into bookers.
Publish Date

I am looking to finish and publish the book in April 2019 with the course following shortly after. Two of the 10 sections have been written and I am already sitting at 10,000 words (not including worksheets). This will be a large book full of practical advice that I know will help grow your business.
The only risk I see is the publish date may slip a little but I am confident this will not happen as I am accumulating, refining and re-writing many years of knowledge.

Excerpt from Intro:
The story I am about to tell is a personal one. A true story, so bare with me. It helps set the tone as to why I feel this book is a must for all tours and activity businesses.
Ever since primary school I have always had a love of Japan. Its history, its culture and its people. In-fact, I have my father to thank for that one.
Our class was assigned to create a mood board to present to the class of any point in history we decided to talk about. I could see my fellow classmates were already deciding on your typical topics such as the world wars or ancient Egypt (this was standard back in the 1980’s), but I wanted to do something different.
After getting home I walked into our lounge and started to flick through my father’s books. This was pre-internet! He was an avid book reader and subscribed to the Reader’s Digest (Is this still a thing?*) which delivered a set of books each month to our door. Once of the books instantly caught my eye.
My Father just received a book on the ancient history of Japan. It had an image of a Samurai warrior on the cover, something I had never seen before but immediately sparked my imagination, and my love for all things Japanese.
Fast forward 25 year and my wife and I decided we wanted to start a family but before we did, wanted to take a ‘once in a lifetime’ trip to somewhere special. It was a choice between Canada and Japan. Suffice to say, Japan won and we set out looking to see what we could do over our planned 2 week trip.
We knew we wanted to to travel across Japan and see as much as we could so, after a quick Google search, we found one company who felt could deliver what we wanted. Why did we decide this? Simple… content.
You see, this company went to great lengths to create good content through video, with most being presented by their own tour guides. I cannot stress enough how important this is. You could see the passion and enthusiasm the guides had for a land they obviously loved.
One such guide, Tyler Palmer, helped the most in selling the various sights we could see in destination. One of these sights would be witnessing the sunrise at the top of Mt Fuji. “Not a chance” was my first thought. Although we are fairly fit and healthy individuals, there is no way we could climb Mt Fuji. We are not ‘athletes’.
After a quick phone call with the company (yes, we spoke to someone… more on this later in the book), we were assured that, although there was no guarantees, we should be able to reach the top of Mt Fuji barring any server altitude sickness.
With this, and with the other sights we did not wish to pass up on, we extended our stay from 2 weeks to nearly a month.
When we finally arrived at Narita Airport we were met by none other than Tyler Palmer, the guide from the videos. Because we saw his videos, meeting him at the airport was like meeting an old friend. It broke the ice and made us feel instantly welcome.
Our time in Japan was a first class experience. We travelled around Japan, visiting many cities and towns, meeting locals and eating some of the best food I have ever had. The sense of accomplishment we also felt when we finally reached the top of Mt Fuji will be with us forever. And the view at the top… stunning.
At time of writing this book, nearly 12 years on, we have recommended that business, and Tyler, on many occasions. We are also still friends with Tyler and keep in communication through Facebook. He now has a young family himself.
The reason I am telling you all this, and incase you have missed the point, the real value to that business was not just our time spent in Japan, but the relationships and recommendations we have made many years later. Hey, I am still sharing my experience with you now.
All off the back on one peice of video marketing, we:

Extended our stay by a further 2 weeks - generating the company more in revenue.
Referred that business on to countless others, and who booked with that company - providing more referral business
Built a friendship with the tour guide and will go back to Japan once our kids are a little older - providing repeat business (We have told Tyler he must be our guide!)

This is how powerful it can be if you tell your story in a genuine, honest way with a cohesive strategy in place.
With this book, my aim is to provide you with the tools and knowhow so you can build your own ‘tribe’ of customers and brand advocates, promoting your business in the right way. I will not only provide practical advice, but worksheets and help guides to assist you along the way.

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have big dreams for this book, and with big dreams comes some expenses, but we really believe that we can reach our goal with the help of our community and beyond. Our $15,000 start-up goal will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initial 500 copies of the book (we want to sell 10,000 eventually!)</li>
<li>Recording costs &amp; payment for musicians</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Publication Costs</li>
<li>And finally, if we reach our goal, we will be producing (drum roll please)........an ANIMATED music video made by the amazing Noah Reiner</li>

</div><div>
<h3>Why So Amazing?</h3>
<p>We (Maya &amp; Meg), met in 2012 at Camp Tawonga where we learned to slow down, and be amazed by the natural world. We lived literally underneath the redwoods, saw millions of stars at night, swam in the Tuolumne river, and learned that in order to care for this world, we must form a relationship with it first. </p>
<p>This book speaks to our values of slowing down, letting yourself be amazed by the natural world, and that we, as humans, have the capacity to cultivate love and admiration for this planet. </p>
<p>This was a natural collaboration with meg as an illustrator deeply inspired by plants, trees, and imagination, and Maya as a musician who prefers to write about mountain-tops and oceans. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Self-publishing is a big endeavor, but we are up to the task. In order to share some of the risk with you, we have already fronted 15% of the start-up costs, because we really believe in this project. </p>

</div></div>","Executive SummaryThe Betrayal of Ka is written, reviewed, and almost ready to go to market. I need your help to successfully launch my Indie publishing career, and to take a huge step toward some audacious goals.After challenging myself to climb the three tallest peaks in Rocky Mountain National Park alone, I redefined the course of my life and am pursuing some previously secret dreams. I always wanted to write a novel, but found years and years of excuses for not doing it.  Standing alone on an isolated mountain peak, I realized that the only person standing in my way was me.As an experienced entrepreneur, I am approaching the publication of my first book as any professional publishing company would. I need your assistance in financing a number of tasks, including:

Hiring a professional, independent editor


Designing a compelling, unique book cover


Creating a publishing infrastructure (ISBNs, POD accounts, etc.)


Launching the first marketing campaigns

Writing the book and surprising friends and family with the quality of the story was validation that I am on the right path. However, becoming a successful Indie author and publisher is only one element of a larger vision for my life. This isn't a one-and-done project. Book two is already partially written. Ultimately, after establishing myself as serious author and getting my wonderful sons through school, I plan to sail around the world.Execution Plan and BudgetSeptember 15, 2015 is the target date for The Betrayal of Ka to be available. Initially, it will be available as an eBook from Amazon. Paperback versions will be available at Amazon, BarnsAndNoble.com, and other online retailers. My launch distribution partners will be KDP Select for eBooks, and CreateSpace and Ingram Spark for print.Pre-Launch MarketingPre-launch marketing efforts will be focused around three primary goals.

Generate pre-launch sales


Grow my social media presence as an author


Create some prelaunch buzz about the book

I will be leveraging this Indiegogo campaign heavily to move towards those goals with my social media network, personal contacts, and professional contacts in multiple industries. Financial BudgetThe follow items represent the primary budget items for preparing the book for launch, creating the publishing infrastructure, and launching sales of the novel.

$1,000 - Professional Editor


$500 - Book cover design

$400 - Promotional print copies for giveaways and reviews

$300 - International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs)


$150 - File Conversion, standardization, and management


$100 - Print On Demand (POD) & Distribution Setup

Total Budget = $2,950. Any amount raised above that amount will be used for additional marketing and for book two expenses.The Betrayal of Ka (The Transprophetics #1)The novel is approximately 96,500 words, which is likely to change some during final professional editing.Blurb - (Publisher speak for that teaser on the back of the book)As the spaceship lands on Earth, Ka's mission is clear - find and kill Transprophetics. His shipmates think of him as a killer. On his home planet of Koranth, he is considered a murderer.

Why
 I believe anybody should learn how to preserve and take care of their sight in a natural and spontaneous way, like we do for other skills of our body. I have been working for years with people that simply used their eyes with a lot of effort and strain without even realize that, suffering from various and sometimes peculiar annoyances.The book is simply explained and I tried to keep it interesting and funny: learning how to get back the abilities that we are supposed to own since we were born, must be joyful and intriguing, not a drag!I already translated in English a small work of mine's as an e-book, that introduces the principles of Visual Training: ""Pinhole glasses & the Bates Method: detective Mouser answers"" and the readers have been very generous with me, giving wonderful reviews on Amazon.

How
 All the funds will be used to pay the translator: it is a long job that need experience and very good language skills, as simplicity about medical issues is difficult to perform.

<span>The first book is called ""Breaking Free from the Dark Depression"" and I wrote this book after I had suffered from my back injury, which caused me to have deep depression.

The story is about a young family who finds out about their true, but frightening past. And that past, has now come back to haunt them in more ways than one.

Writing this book was a lot of fun, bringing the future, past, and present together. If you love reading, then you will love this book. The story is about a young family who finds out about their true, but frightening past. And that past, has now come back to haunt them in more ways than one. Strange and mysterious things start to happen to make them turn against each other. Tearing the family apart. The battle begins, and only the strongest one will survive. There you go! The first few sentences.So please contribute and share my fundraising site with anyone you think would support me. The 2,500 euros will be used to get both books printed, published and designed. Even if I don't reach my fundraising goal, everyone will get exactly what they paid for, no matter what. I am hopeful and positive that we can do this together, so we can all read and enjoy new and exciting stories. I would be very grateful if somebody could help me to bring this project... To a happy end. Sincerely,Shirley Sarp",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Here at The Peace Party our actions are fuelled by love.
However, love cannot pay for an electoral deposit or printing costs for campaign flyers and posters.
Who are we?
PPCs - John Morris (National Organiser, party co-founder), Jim Duggan ('People's Peace Party' founder) Tommy Holgate (Media Spokesperson), Julie Roxborough (Animal Rights Expert).
This campaign is important to us because it is about time the political arena saw more conscious discussion present in its day-to-day activity.
The Peace Party is a pacifist party that would rather see military deployed in a humanitarian manner.
By contributing to this campaign, you will be adding to the growing number of individuals who are taking an active role in the global discussion on how to achieve world peace.
Many people tell us 'it isn't possible'. However, on a literal level, it is.
Hence, we are committed to doing all we can to bring measures of peace into the world and are keen to be to peace what The Greens have been to environmental causes.
Mahatma Gandhi: ""The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.""
Martin Luther King: ""Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal.""

We have set the fundraising target at a modest £500, which would be 100 memberships at £5 each, or just 25 members signing up for the £20 rate.
There are also perks related to dance classes, tai chi sessions and holistic health wellness days (including massage, colour therapy, nutrition workshops and more) that are tailored to teambuilding events for your school, workplace, sports team and so on.
RISKS:
There really is no risk to signing up to assist us in this campaign. 
The 'worst case scenario' is that we don't get elected, but will have spent several months spreading a message of peace in our communities. 
Our inner world creates our outer world, so by getting on board you are taking a step towards enjoying a fine sense of harmony in your inner world, knowing that your core intentions are aligned with those loving energies that so pervade the entire universe.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is something I've dreamed of doing for a long time, but it was only last year that I decided to start sharing my fiction writing with others. I've been doing some form of writing for most of my life, and spent over twelve years in music journalism. Just last April, I wrote ""The Wanderer,"" my first short story in ages, and it blossomed from there. I was initially nervous to share my work, but as time went on and the number of readers I had grew, I felt that it was time to make the jump into getting a book published. I absolutely could not be here without the wonderful people that have taken their time to read my writing and leave positive words of encouragement, and I will be forever thankful to them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The actual writing on all of these stories (aside from any custom ones) is done. The only real challenge is raising enough money for printing. Even if the campaign doesn't reach the $1,000 goal, I will still get the printing done. Due to the increased cost of printing hardcover books, those will only be available if the campaign reaches at least $800. The first priorities are getting the cover art done and the stories professionally edited, which won't be terribly expensive. Printing is the priciest step in the process, but I will make sure it happens no matter what. In the chance that it does not, I will ensure that each and every backer receives a full refund, but the likelihood of that becoming necessary is slim to none.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> If you can't contribute, I absolutely understand. You can help by telling your friends, sharing my stories, and just helping to get the word out about ""Bridges."" My readers have grown entirely due to word of mouth from you guys, and that will help once again here. The simple fact that you take the time to read my writing already means so much to me, and I can never thank you all enough. So please feel free to share, or ask me if you wish to help in some other ways.<br/>

<p>Hi. I'm Greta Christina -- author and editor of several
books, mostly about either sex or atheism. I<span>'m writing an erotic fiction novel, and I'd love your help!<br/></span></p>
<p>My novel is currently titled ""Coming."" It tells
the story of one woman's sex life, starting in 1970 when she's 18, and ending
in roughly the present day. Each chapter describes a different sexual
encounter, at a different point in her life. The book is a series of intense
sex scenes, with several years between them. I'm looking at this woman's life -- her name is Sheila -- through the lens of sex. I'm exploring Sheila's sex
life, the rest of her life, and how they intertwine. In particular, I'm
looking at how she makes choices about sex. Sheila is often adventurous, even
reckless, she makes decisions impulsively -- but she's also cautious, a careful
planner, likes to be in control. I'm interested in how being both impulsive and
a control freak plays out out in her sex life.
</p><p>I'm writing the novel with lots of fun, hot, sexy sex.
Women with women, women with men, probably some men with men, probably some
gender fluidity, some of it kinky and SM-y, some of it not. It is an erotic
novel, and I'm making it erotic. It's also a <b>novel</b> -- a story about people's lives. As you know if you've read
my erotic fiction, I hate erotica that's, ""plot, sex scene, plot, sex
scene."" I don't see these as separate. Erotica is much hotter when you get
a sense of what the sex <b>feels</b> like
-- not just what's happening physically, but the emotions, the sensations, how
this sex is going to change the characters' lives.<br/><br/>I'm not going to be falsely
modest -- as an erotic fiction writer, I am very good at this, it's one of the
things I do best. People who have read my short erotic fiction collection, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bending-Stories-Religion-Unicorns-ebook/dp/B00CBWYT5C/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bending</a>, can attest to this. (Don't take my word for it -- the reviews, both professional and from Amazon customers, are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bending-Stories-Religion-Unicorns-ebook/dp/B00CBWYT5C/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">glowing</a>.)</p>
<p>So. Hopefully you're intrigued, and want to read this
novel. Why am I doing an Indiegogo campaign?</p>
<p>There are expenses with writing and publishing a book. I
generally self-publish my ebooks, which means paying a formatter. I'm a control
freak about cover design, which means I get wonderful covers -- but also means
I have to pay a designer.</p>
<p>But the Number One expense of writing a book is time. Books
do not spring fully formed from an author. It takes time -- and I'll need to
pay the bills and the mortgage while I'm writing it. I'll keep doing my other
paid writing -- blogging, magazine articles, etc. -- but I won't able to do as
much of it. Writing a book is immensely fun, deeply rewarding -- erotic fiction
especially -- and it produces something of substance that people want to read.
But it takes time. Whenever you buy a book, or support an author's crowdfunding
campaign, that's most of what you're paying for. The more money I raise, the
more time I'll be able to put into this book, and the better it will be.</p>
<p>I'm offering a number of perks for donators. They're
listed here, on this Indiegogo page. Perks include signed copies of the book,
regular updates about the book's progress, invitations to a private book launch
party, one-on-one Skype conversations about the book, and thank yous, of
course. But mostly, I hope you want to read this novel. Please kick in what you
can, and please help spread the word. Thanks!</p>

<p><em><strong>How Gemini Season came about…</strong></em></p>
<p>The first poem in Gemini Season …musing, titled “See You Tomorrow?” speaks of Kenny, the person who unknowingly started it all. He was the one who introduced me to Michael, referred throughout the book as Mr. Gemini, Mic Truth, Boogie (Down Bronx) and Alexander the Great. After sharing the story of my life with him in poetic for he made the suggestion of putting a book together and I thought about it, prayed about it, discussed it with a fellow author and longtime friend of mine, Angelot Ndongmo, weighed the pros and cons of the different publishing options and decided that I was going to do it.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Can I share my story with you?



My name is Kebrina (K'brina) Morgan and I am the author of Gemini Season ...musing. It is a book of poetry that tells of my journey from the lowest point in my life to where I currently am, ""My journey from Pain to Prosperity"" as I like to refer to it. The book begins with the death of a very influential friend and the introduction of Mr. Gemini. It continues to me having my daughter taken away, losing my husband, my home and basically everything that I valued or held dare to my heart. It speaks of my mindset and where I was and how I coped.

The $3,000 that I'm requesting will be used to pay for the printing, marketing and distribution of the books. I managed to cut some cost by doing the artwork and layout myself.

How Gemini Season came about…
The first poem in Gemini Season …musing, titled “See You Tomorrow?” speaks of Kenny, the person who unknowingly started it all. He was the one who introduced me to Michael, referred throughout the book as Mr. Gemini, Mic Truth, Boogie (Down Bronx) and Alexander the Great. After sharing the story of my life with him in poetic for he made the suggestion of putting a book together and I thought about it, prayed about it, discussed it with a fellow author and longtime friend of mine, Angelot Ndongmo, weighed the pros and cons of the different publishing options and decided that I was going to do it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am an academic and media artist who studied at Eötvös Loránd University’s Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences Departments and holds two master degrees in aesthetics and cultural anthropology.

<h3>More details about the research</h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Goals of research -</strong> My overall objective is to finalize my Ph.D. thesis that is focusing on the comparison of the European and American Jewish Museums, how the first salon like in Vienna or the basic collections in Budapest or Berlin become a center of Jewish culture and how it differs from the first Jewish Museum in the USA. Thanks to the Fulbright Scholarship I had a visiting scholar position at the New York University Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies for the 2015/2016 academic year under the guidance of Professor Hasia R. Diner. Through this opportunity I was able to visit most of the American Jewish Museums that I planned to use for my dissertation and thanks to my supervisor I had the possibility to gain more knowledge about American Jewish history. I had the chance to visit the Skirball Museum and the Tolerance Center in Los Angeles (including an interview with the director), the Jewish Museums in Miami, Atlanta, Philadelphia and San Francisco, including all the museums that deals with Jewish topics in New York. </p>
<p>As an aesthete and cultural anthropologist my thesis invokes various fields of discipline such as historiography, cultural and visual studies, cultural philosophy, sociology or anthropology. I argue for the power of art that is not only a product of history but also its agent to transform as well as shape the ways cultural, historical issues are being conceived. In my research I discover the educational methods behind the objects and memorials, and understand the international message of the museum itself. Besides the Fulbright scholarship until now I had the possibility through other scholarships to research in Hungary, Austria and Germany, but my interest brought me to visit several Jewish Museums in Europe to include them. I have visited the most of the Jewish Museums in Europe, like Belgium (Brussels), Czech Republic (Prague), France (Paris), The Netherlands (Amsterdam), Poland (Krakow, Warsaw), Spain (Barcelona, Cordoba), Turkey (Istanbul), U.K. (London), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo), Lithuania (Vilnius), Italy (Rome) and Denmark (Copenhagen) which I like to use as examples when I create my categories and compare them by function. </p>
<p>The dissertation starts with the most important question in this topic, what a Jewish Museum in general means, how we can define it as an institution and also what is the reason for their existence. The European and American way is different in how the ideology of the institution developed. As Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett says “virtually all “Jewish museums” in Europe are Holocaust museums by another name, with some possible exceptions. Outside Europe, Jewish museums are often immigration museums by another name.” These characteristics give a value to the museum itself and also for the space that changed a lot in the last twenty years. As we look ahead to the future of the museums in the twenty-first century, we are not only talking about the changes of the space but also about the understandings of communication and online visibility. I am exploring the types of museological and educational tools being used to communicate offline and online about Jewish art and the interpretation of these pieces. </p>
<p><strong>Importance of the research - </strong>Jewish Museums are popular destinations for both Jewish and non-Jewish visitors. Most of these institutions were created to house the local community’s relics and ritual objects (Judaicas). Later on they became places for exhibiting Jewish history and culture. The museums are used for informal education purposes not only for students and adults in the local community but also for tourists. The permanent collection and the temporary exhibition together express the museum's image. This image has strongly expanded in the last few years thanks to the growing online presence of these institutions (website and other media platforms), so this conceptual development is becoming faster and more visible internationally. Still there are a lot of questions about the topic, - especially because of the development what I mentioned above, - not so many resources are focusing on this issue. The Jewish Museum’s concepts developed in the 1980s in Europe and there are only a few that are exceptions. Jewish Museums are in a transition phase in two ways. The first one is the technical development, - what I call Revolution in my title -, which changes not only the presentation but also the understanding of these institutions. The second one is the content, because the current exhibitions need to be rethought. Most of these places want to adopt this new, changing methodology and they want to catch the attention of a broader audience.</p>
<p>I believe this research is unique because a comparison still does not exist which discusses about the technical development as a new revolution and the representation of the Jewish Museums. There are some platforms to rethink the European Jewish museums future, which started their work not long time ago in public. These are the Association of European Jewish Museums, The Rothschild Foundation Europe and a new program called RFE-Paideia Museum Program, which organized their first conference in early 2014. These experiments are very promising, although the academic research is not part of the innovations yet. My research can join to this new way of thinking and rethinking of the Jewish Museums and I hope it can be useful not only as an academic dissertation but also as part of the renewal. With my previous research projects in Budapest, Vienna or Berlin I would say there is a constant need to redefine what a museum is or can be, but first we have to define the story behind the place.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hello there! My name is Jennifer Sights, and I'm really glad you've found your way to my campaign. I've published 3 books, 2 of which are part of my Elena Ronen, PI urban fantasy series. People have been asking me for over a year when the final book in the trilogy will be published, and until now, I haven't been able to give them an answer.</p>
<p>You see, I was taken down with a serious case of LIFE this past year and change, and haven't been able to write much. But I'm back now, and the words are flowing, and I plan to have Deceived in your hands by the end of October, 2016. (That's this year!)</p>
<p>Because you've waited so long for this book, and because it's the last in the trilogy, I want to make sure I can make it the absolute best book I possibly can. To do that, I need your help raising money for every step of the publishing process. Publishing isn't cheap, and I haven't managed to find that money tree yet.</p>
<p>By helping me, I'll be able to give you an amazing end to Elena and Vittorio's story. I'll have given you the ending I promised over 3 years ago, and will be able to move on to new project with a clean conscience. I can't express how much your help would mean to me, and I promise you'll be happy with the finished product.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I need a total of $2350 to cover all my production costs. Here's how that breaks down:</p> <ul> <li>Story Consulting - $100</li>
<li>Professional Editing - $1200</li>
<li>Book Formatting - TBD</li>
<li>Promotional Materials - $200</li>
<li>Initial Inventory - $750</li>
<li>IndieGoGo fees - $100</li>
</ul>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Chase Night is my story tamer. He's read the first two books, and will read this one as well, and give me feedback on things like does the plot make sense, does it flow well, is the dialogue smooth, etc.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Jason Whited is my editor, and will read the book for grammar, sentence structure, all that stuff most people hate during English classes. He edited Burning Darkness, and is absolutely amazing to work with!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Formatting books isn't as easy as you might think, and the last one I tried to edit myself...let's just say I almost threw my laptop out the window, and ended up contacting Garret Robinson begging him for some last minute help. This time, I'm going to skip the laptop-chucking and start with him right away, so the book can be beautiful as well as entertaining.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And since books don't sell themselves, I need to create some promo materials, such as bookmarks and postcards. This will help me reach even more people when I sell at conventions and other physical locations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A box of books is heavy, and paper isn't free. I need inventory so I can get the signed paperback that is part of some of the perks in your hands. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Finally, IndieGoGo is a business, and they charge a 5% fee for using their platform.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>UNIQUE PERKS!</b></div>
<div>In addition to the usual perks of various eBook or paperback bundles, there are unique perks like the opportunity to name a character or make a cameo yourself, have a private Skype session with Jennifer, and even get private coaching from Jennifer to write your own book!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Wanna get really crazy? Bring Jennifer to YOUR city to do an event for your group. Perfect for librarians, book clubs, writing groups, and more!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All backers at the $10 level and above will also receive an exclusive short story (to be delivered 2-3 months after Deceived is published) and their name on the acknowledgements page.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">What happens if I don't reach my funding goal?</b>
</div>
<div>All money raised will still go to the production of this book. I'll just have to put a bit more on my credit cards to get the project going. But no matter what, Deceived WILL be published at the end of October.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">What happens if I blow my goal out of the water?</b>
</div>
<div>If I raise more than my goal, all extra money will go to production of audiobooks for Ravaged and Deceived.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As I've already said, people have been asking me when this book will be published for a long time. It's time I make good on that long overdue promise. </p>
<p>But beyond that, stories are important. They help people escape for a period of time. They help people connect. And if you're really lucky, your story will help people discover themselves.</p>
<p>Sharing this story with the world is the true reason I am running this campaign. It touches my heart every time I hear from a reader about how my books impacted them, and I want to touch more people's lives.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>No major project is without its risks. There's a chance I could suddenly be called up on to work insane amounts of hours at my day job. I could get gravely ill and be unable to meet the October deadline. All sorts of catastrophes can happen.</p>
<p>Short of life altering events, I have a solid plan for getting Deceived published. I have written my schedule on a whiteboard hanging by my writing desk where I will see it every day. I have accountability buddies with whom I check in every day to make sure I'm reaching my wordcount or whatever that day's goal is.</p>
<p>If something extreme should happen that absolutely prevents me from publishing by October, that won't mean Deceived won't ever get published. It may just be slightly delayed.</p>
<p>However, I foresee very little risk to this project.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you want to help, but don't have any money to spare, that's ok! You can still help by spreading the word about this campaign and getting your friends - online and off - excited about the project. Maybe they'll be able to help too.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and hopefully donate. I know your life is busy and your time is valuable, so thank you from the depths of my heart.</p>

You see, I was taken down with a serious case of LIFE this past year and change, and haven't been able to write much. But I'm back now, and the words are flowing, and I plan to have Deceived in your hands by the end of October, 2016. (That's this year!)
Because you've waited so long for this book, and because it's the last in the trilogy, I want to make sure I can make it the absolute best book I possibly can. To do that, I need your help raising money for every step of the publishing process. Publishing isn't cheap, and I haven't managed to find that money tree yet.
By helping me, I'll be able to give you an amazing end to Elena and Vittorio's story. I'll have given you the ending I promised over 3 years ago, and will be able to move on to new project with a clean conscience. I can't express how much your help would mean to me, and I promise you'll be happy with the finished product.   What I Need & What You Get I need a total of $2350 to cover all my production costs. Here's how that breaks down:  Story Consulting - $100
Professional Editing - $1200
Book Formatting - TBD
Promotional Materials - $200
Initial Inventory - $750
IndieGoGo fees - $100


Chase Night is my story tamer. He's read the first two books, and will read this one as well, and give me feedback on things like does the plot make sense, does it flow well, is the dialogue smooth, etc.


Jason Whited is my editor, and will read the book for grammar, sentence structure, all that stuff most people hate during English classes. He edited Burning Darkness, and is absolutely amazing to work with!

Formatting books isn't as easy as you might think, and the last one I tried to edit myself...let's just say I almost threw my laptop out the window, and ended up contacting Garret Robinson begging him for some last minute help. This time, I'm going to skip the laptop-chucking and start with him right away, so the book can be beautiful as well as entertaining.

And since books don't sell themselves, I need to create some promo materials, such as bookmarks and postcards. This will help me reach even more people when I sell at conventions and other physical locations.

A box of books is heavy, and paper isn't free. I need inventory so I can get the signed paperback that is part of some of the perks in your hands. 

Finally, IndieGoGo is a business, and they charge a 5% fee for using their platform.

UNIQUE PERKS!
In addition to the usual perks of various eBook or paperback bundles, there are unique perks like the opportunity to name a character or make a cameo yourself, have a private Skype session with Jennifer, and even get private coaching from Jennifer to write your own book!

Wanna get really crazy? Bring Jennifer to YOUR city to do an event for your group. Perfect for librarians, book clubs, writing groups, and more!

All backers at the $10 level and above will also receive an exclusive short story (to be delivered 2-3 months after Deceived is published) and their name on the acknowledgements page.


What happens if I don't reach my funding goal?

All money raised will still go to the production of this book. I'll just have to put a bit more on my credit cards to get the project going. But no matter what, Deceived WILL be published at the end of October.


What happens if I blow my goal out of the water?

If I raise more than my goal, all extra money will go to production of audiobooks for Ravaged and Deceived.
   The Impact As I've already said, people have been asking me when this book will be published for a long time. It's time I make good on that long overdue promise. 
But beyond that, stories are important. They help people escape for a period of time. They help people connect. And if you're really lucky, your story will help people discover themselves.
Sharing this story with the world is the true reason I am running this campaign. It touches my heart every time I hear from a reader about how my books impacted them, and I want to touch more people's lives.
Risks & Challenges
 No major project is without its risks. There's a chance I could suddenly be called up on to work insane amounts of hours at my day job. I could get gravely ill and be unable to meet the October deadline. All sorts of catastrophes can happen.
Short of life altering events, I have a solid plan for getting Deceived published. I have written my schedule on a whiteboard hanging by my writing desk where I will see it every day. I have accountability buddies with whom I check in every day to make sure I'm reaching my wordcount or whatever that day's goal is.
If something extreme should happen that absolutely prevents me from publishing by October, that won't mean Deceived won't ever get published. It may just be slightly delayed.
However, I foresee very little risk to this project.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you want to help, but don't have any money to spare, that's ok! You can still help by spreading the word about this campaign and getting your friends - online and off - excited about the project. Maybe they'll be able to help too.
Thanks so much for taking the time to read this and hopefully donate. I know your life is busy and your time is valuable, so thank you from the depths of my heart.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>В чём смысл ""путеводителя по смыслам""?</h3>
<p>Идея «Иллюстрированного путеводителя по смыслам Алматы» возникла в ответ на запрос гостей города, которые ходили по нему, и никак не могли его понять. Но и нам, алматинцам, бывает сложно принять и понять нынешний Алматы. То, что вчера делало его ""городом-садом"", завтра может быть попросту снесено, или уже снесено, многие артефакты остаются лишь на фотографиях и в памяти горожан.</p>
<p>Что же в такой ситуации может рассказать нам о городе?</p>
<p>Что может проявить его смыслы, рассказать о том, чем город важен и дорог его обитателям?</p>
<p>Мы задались этими вопросами и решили создать путеводитель, который позволит увидеть Алматы глазами живущих здесь художников, писателей, поэтов, то есть людей, хранящих в памяти историю города и тонко чувствующих его современное состояние. ​У нас, кажется, получилось.</p>
<p>При поддержке фонда Сорос-Казахстан мы издали первую версию ""путеводителя"" в декабре 2017 года. </p>
<p>Книги разлетелись с невероятной для нашего города скоростью. Через 3 недели у нас остались только экземпляры, припасённые в качестве вознаграждений для этого краудфандинга. И про них продолжают спрашивать.</p>
<p><strong>Давайте напечтаем ещё?</strong></p>

<p>Это книга, где все тексты связаны с городом, и у каждого, как у настощего городского жителя,  есть адрес. Тексты привязаны к карте, и вы можете ходить по городу и смотреть на него глазами авторов этих текстов, узнавать о городе что-то новое. Эта книга объединяет литературные и урбанистические практики, а ещё делает читателей - художниками, потому что в ней можно рисовать. Мы постарались сделать иллюстрации такими, чтобы их хотелось раскрашивать и дорисовывать. ​<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544449509/ktk7uqwexgiitbtn47tf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Что даст проекту этот краудфандинг?</h3>
<ul>
<li>мы сможем напечтать <strong>ещё один тираж</strong>. В каждое вознаграждение заложена небольшая сумма, которая поможет нам напечтать немного больше книг, которые мы сможем распространять через книжные магазины, и которые, как мы надеемся, позволят нам допечатывать <strong>новые тиражи</strong>.</li>
<li>а это уже позволит нам собирать новый путеводитель, с новыми текстами и новыми иллюстрациями. Мы очень хотим продолжать собирать алматинские тексты и сделать путеводитель<strong> полноценным периодическим изданием</strong>. </li>
<li>так путеводитель станет постоянно доступен для жителей и гостей города.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Что этот краудфандинг даст миру?</h3>
<ul><li>такие проекты, как путеводитель, помогают расти нашей, собственной, <strong>алматинской литературе</strong>. Мы считаем, что это немало!</li></ul>
<h3>Что этот краудфандинг даст вам?</h3>
<ul>
<li>в первую очередь, конечно, <strong>книги</strong>
</li>
<li>которые - очень хороший <strong>сувенир из Алматы</strong>
</li>
<li>Особенно <strong>на английском</strong>. Второй тираж выйдет полностью обновлённым - он отредактирован профессиональным англоязычным редактором благодаря поддержке от US Consulate Almaty. А первый тираж останется библиографической редкостью!</li>
<li>ещё в вознаграждениях есть <strong>оригиналы иллюстраций</strong>. Их можно купить только здесь!</li>
<li>и литературный <strong>мастер-класс Лили Калаус</strong>! </li>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","В чём смысл ""путеводителя по смыслам""?
Идея «Иллюстрированного путеводителя по смыслам Алматы» возникла в ответ на запрос гостей города, которые ходили по нему, и никак не могли его понять. Но и нам, алматинцам, бывает сложно принять и понять нынешний Алматы. То, что вчера делало его ""городом-садом"", завтра может быть попросту снесено, или уже снесено, многие артефакты остаются лишь на фотографиях и в памяти горожан.
Что же в такой ситуации может рассказать нам о городе?
Что может проявить его смыслы, рассказать о том, чем город важен и дорог его обитателям?
Мы задались этими вопросами и решили создать путеводитель, который позволит увидеть Алматы глазами живущих здесь художников, писателей, поэтов, то есть людей, хранящих в памяти историю города и тонко чувствующих его современное состояние. ​У нас, кажется, получилось.
При поддержке фонда Сорос-Казахстан мы издали первую версию ""путеводителя"" в декабре 2017 года. 
Книги разлетелись с невероятной для нашего города скоростью. Через 3 недели у нас остались только экземпляры, припасённые в качестве вознаграждений для этого краудфандинга. И про них продолжают спрашивать.
Давайте напечтаем ещё?



Что это?
Книга ""Путеводитель по смыслам Алматы"" - это:


1,5 года работы над книгой

3 языка

3 открытых конкурса текстов
команда: 4 редактора, 2 переводчика, 1 художница-верстальщица-дизайнер

23 современных автора 

31 напечатанный текст

38 иллюстраций

132 страницы в твёрдой обложке
а теперь ещё и мобильное приложение с озвученными текстами (+16 текстов!)

Это книга, где все тексты связаны с городом, и у каждого, как у настощего городского жителя,  есть адрес. Тексты привязаны к карте, и вы можете ходить по городу и смотреть на него глазами авторов этих текстов, узнавать о городе что-то новое. Эта книга объединяет литературные и урбанистические практики, а ещё делает читателей - художниками, потому что в ней можно рисовать. Мы постарались сделать иллюстрации такими, чтобы их хотелось раскрашивать и дорисовывать. ​
 
Кто мы?
 

Меня зовут Зоя Фалькова, это я придумала ""путеводитель по смыслам"" во время прогулки по Алматы с друзьями из другого города, и это я сейчас сижу и пишу этот текст. Именно я буду ответственной за этот краудфандинг. 
Обычно я занимаюсь современным искусством, и вы можете знать меня по моим инсталляциям и выставкам, но у меня есть ещё и такие проекты, как путеводитель. Я нежно люблю этот проект, и хочу, чтобы он развивался дальше. Он объединяет целых три моих любимых занятия - искусство, городские исследования и практики, литературу.  Один из наших авторов, Талгат Даиров, пророчил этому изданию долгую исчастливую жизнь и много новых точек на карте, и вообще, стать новым Нью-Йоркером. Ох, Талгат, надеюсь, вы правы. Очень хочется, чтоб. 
 

Это Лиля Калаус (Алексеева) - наша главная редактор. Филолог, писатель, блогер, литературный редактор, сценарист, радиоведущая, преподавательница литературного мастерства. С 2001 по 2014 гг. была главным редактором литературного журнала «Книголюб». Лауреат I и III премий литературного конкурса «Сорос-Казахстан-Дебют» (1996), лауреат Третьего Открытого книжного форума и литературного фестиваля стран Центральной Азии (2014). Член Союза писателей Казахстана. Автор множества книг, рассказов, статей.
Словом, очень крутая редактор у проекта.
Её тексты также вошли в путеводитель, а ещё она озвучила большую часть путеводителя для мобильного приложения Alaguide.
 

А это Антон Платонов - профессиональный перводчик с английского и на английский, арт-менеджер, координатор проекта, и помощник во всём.
Антон - главный по мобильному приложению и английской версии всего, что входит в проект. Он очень умный.
 
А вот как всё начиналось:

 
Нас уже поддерживают:

 
Что говорят о путеводителе?

 
Что даст проекту этот краудфандинг?

мы сможем напечтать ещё один тираж. В каждое вознаграждение заложена небольшая сумма, которая поможет нам напечтать немного больше книг, которые мы сможем распространять через книжные магазины, и которые, как мы надеемся, позволят нам допечатывать новые тиражи.
а это уже позволит нам собирать новый путеводитель, с новыми текстами и новыми иллюстрациями. Мы очень хотим продолжать собирать алматинские тексты и сделать путеводитель полноценным периодическим изданием. 
так путеводитель станет постоянно доступен для жителей и гостей города.

Что этот краудфандинг даст миру?
такие проекты, как путеводитель, помогают расти нашей, собственной, алматинской литературе. Мы считаем, что это немало!
Что этот краудфандинг даст вам?

в первую очередь, конечно, книги

которые - очень хороший сувенир из Алматы

Особенно на английском. Второй тираж выйдет полностью обновлённым - он отредактирован профессиональным англоязычным редактором благодаря поддержке от US Consulate Almaty. А первый тираж останется библиографической редкостью!
ещё в вознаграждениях есть оригиналы иллюстраций. Их можно купить только здесь!
и литературный мастер-класс Лили Калаус! 
ну и ещё небольшой ворох приятных мелочей вроде закладок и открыток. 

Тут куча вознаграждений! Почему так много вариантов?
Потому что мы припасли для вас часть тиража. И вы можете получить экземпляры путеводителя в подарок сразу, и потом ещё столько же экземпляров из второго тиража, когда мы его напечатаем! Но количество книг, которые можно получить сразу, ограничено!  Торопитесь успеть! 

 
Куда пойдут деньги?


Сколько нам нужно?
Чтобы напечатать новый тираж путеводителя на русском и английском, произвести и доставить все вознаграждения, нам нужно 1 600 000 тенге. 
В стоимость каждой книги заложены:

себестоимость печати
стоимость доставки
комиссия платформы, комиссия бакнковских систем и налоги
транспортные расходы

Остальные вознаграждения, которые не книги, состоят из:

себестоимости и стоимости доставки
себестоимости печати книг
комиссии платформы, комиссии бакнковских систем и налогов
транспортных расходов

Что насчет рисков?
Если сумма будет больше намеченной, то мы просто напечатаем больше книг.
Если сумма будет меньше намеченной, но достаточной для минимального тиража (100 экз.) то мы напечатаем минимальный тираж. Сумма, заложенная на дополнительные книги, страхует нас в этом случае.
Если мы не соберём даже на минимальный тираж, а такой риск всегда существует, то первым взносчикам в любом случае достанутся остатки первого тиража, а мы начнём искать средства где-то ещё, и в итоге всё равно его напечатаем, и вы получите вознаграждения.

<p>Some Australians idolise the memory of the British maritime explorer Captain James Cook. Some don't give a hoot. And there are others that know he wasn't all that. Overall, the hoo-ha over Cook in the lead up to 2020 - a jam-packed year of Cook commemorations - is cooked.</p>
<p>So how to push-back on hyperbole around false idols of the whiteband approach to history? </p>
<div><p>Roast them - cook up some trouble - spill the tea - serve up the truth. </p></div>
<h3>The elevator pitch:</h3>
<p>In the lead up to the 250th anniversary of HMB Endeavour's journey along the eastern coast of Australia, <i>Cook Gets Cooked Commemorative Cookbook </i>is a timely anthology of non-fiction essays, short stories, poetry, satirical cartoons, and actual recipes</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's the plan?</h3>
<p>Through an open submission process, creative works will be selected and compiled into an anthology titled <i>Cook Gets Cooked Commemorative Cookbook</i>.</p>
<p><strong>The book is expected to include non-fictional essays, satirical pieces, short stories, cartoons/graphics, poetry, political commentary, and cooking recipes. Overall, the book will be educational, political, creative, informative and fun.</strong></p>
<p>The call for submissions will be open to all writers, academics, illustrators, poets and other creatives, but priority will be given to First Peoples of Australia and the Pacific. A team of at least three will select the pieces.</p>
<p>Works selected for inclusion will be paid a fair, industry-standard rate (using Australian rates). Creatives will be asked to sign an agreement, which will outline their rights (including copyrights) and obligations, the publisher's obligations, and long-term plan for the publication. </p>
<p>These rates and conditions will be promoted when the call for submissions opens. In the meantime, there is some relevant information in the questions section.</p>
<p>A <strong>range of products</strong> with suitably-themed graphics will be produced, in addition to the book, and made available to backers in the campaign packages. Including bookmarks, coffee mugs and limited edition t-shirts.</p>
<h3>How much is needed to launch?</h3>
<p>This project is underpinned by good ethical principles, one being fair payment for creatives. So the budget factors in <strong>payment for the writers/illustrators </strong>of the pieces selected to be published in the anthology. [estimated 30% of budget]<br/><br/>There will specific parts of the project <strong>outsourced to suitably skilled people</strong>, with a preference given to First People creatives and small businesses. This includes: copy editing, typesetting, cover design, and graphics for the campaign add-ons (e.g t-shirts). Other expenses that need to be factored in are: marketing and promotion (inc public appearances), financial fees, office expenses, book launch, production of the books and other goods to be offered in the campaign packages, postage and handling. [estimated 50% of budget]<br/><br/>I'm capable of completing a lot of the tasks involved (i.e. PR, website, editorial, finances &amp; administration) and this project will involve a lot of my time, so there's an <strong>allocation for project management</strong>. [estimated 20% of budget]</p>
<p><strong>If the campaign exceeds targets</strong>: more pieces will be selected, meaning more creatives will be paid. And the rate they receive will rise. Plus, creatives will be funded to appear at literature events to talk about the anthology and their work.</p>
<p><strong>If the campaign is wildly successful</strong>: I (and others?) will hit the road, meeting the replica of The Endeavour at some of the stop-off points the Australian government is funding in 2020. (39 stops have been promoted, as the vessel circumnavigates Australia. It would be good to share funds with other First Peoples, to give the settler-colonialists a fitting 'welcome' at some of these locations.)</p>
<p><strong>If the campaign doesn't reach target</strong>: the book will be smaller and less copies produced.</p>
<p><strong>If there's not enough to even produce a smaller book</strong>: the funds (minus expenses) will be donated to Australian-based repatriation projects, to help bring First Peoples' artefacts and ancestors home from European museums, universities and other institutes.</p>
<h3>What's the timeline?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The campaign will close at the end of March 2019. In the meantime, project planning will continue.</li>
<li>The project, updates and tasters of content will shift to a different platform - mostly likely Wordpress and twitter.</li>
<li>A call out for submissions will open by May 2019, with selection by the end of June. </li>
<li>Production of the book and products will commence in July.</li>
<li>It is envisioned that backers will receive their packages (books and/or add-on goods) by October 2019.</li>
<li>The book will be made available for general sale after backers receive their copies.</li>
<li>It is envisioned that the book will continue to be marketed and sold for at least four years.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>I'm currently a <a href=""https://karenwyld.com/consultancy-services/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">freelance writer and consultant</a>, but I've worked in a lot of different roles within diverse sectors.<br/><br/>I've always been fascinated with history, including settler-colonisation history. As an Australian of Aboriginal (Martu), English and Irish heritage, I'm aware of the conflicting roles my ancestors chose/were allocated in the invasion and settlement. I choose to walk in the footsteps of my First Peoples ancestors and, when times are tough, remember the long-walks to freedom that my Martu grandmother undertook.</p>
<p>I'm a strong advocate for equity, truth-telling, cultural safety and First Peoples rights. Having worked in education, community development, health and other people-orientated sectors, I now apply ethical principles to creative industries. I welcome the growing movement towards access, equity and own-voice within the arts, especially literature. </p>
<p>I believe I've got the skills, knowledge and networks to successfully undertake this creative project. I've given a brief outline of these in the question section.</p>

Who are you?
I'm currently a freelance writer and consultant, but I've worked in a lot of different roles within diverse sectors.I've always been fascinated with history, including settler-colonisation history. As an Australian of Aboriginal (Martu), English and Irish heritage, I'm aware of the conflicting roles my ancestors chose/were allocated in the invasion and settlement. I choose to walk in the footsteps of my First Peoples ancestors and, when times are tough, remember the long-walks to freedom that my Martu grandmother undertook.
I'm a strong advocate for equity, truth-telling, cultural safety and First Peoples rights. Having worked in education, community development, health and other people-orientated sectors, I now apply ethical principles to creative industries. I welcome the growing movement towards access, equity and own-voice within the arts, especially literature. 
I believe I've got the skills, knowledge and networks to successfully undertake this creative project. I've given a brief outline of these in the question section.

<p>We all have something in common. We are all going to die. Death affects every man woman and child. There is so much fear and grief connected to passing over and the losing of loved ones especially children and others in tragic circumstances. The peace and joy felt on survival and consequent reunions cannot be expressed. </p>
<p>To be given THE TRUTH with such a strong indicator of Forensic evidence is life and world-changing. I have an exclusive contract to produce this work and the series of books to follow. This book will help to do this. </p>
<p>First, short reviews (See complete reviews on my site). Well esteemed colleagues and peers in this field, and who have been involved with the afterlife for so many years, have shown great interest and given reviews.</p>

<p>“Having read this amazing book of transcriptions, listened to the recordings, a real must-have, they are incredible, I am blown away! In one recording there is a “fairy tale ending” in which a gentleman after losing a loved one early, turning to a life of crime, is reunited to live the life the lovers could have had. A real Romeo and Juliet moment”</p>

<p>""The best way for anybody to learn the truth about Life After Death, is for them to converse at length with those spirit people who have themselves enjoyed an 'Earth Life' before passing into the spirit world after their 'Death'. In this superb and unforgettable book by Leo Bonomo, he has gone a long way towards realising the case for 'Post Mortem Survival' by presenting a carefully chosen cross-selection of conversations with various spirit people - some well known in their lifetimes, and some not - speaking in their original (earth time) living voices, but recorded well after their 'death' through the remarkable physical mediumship of Leslie Flint.”</p>
<p>Stewart Alexander</p>
<p>For over half a century I have studiously researched all aspects of the Spiritualist movement particularly that of Physical Mediumship past and present. During the early years and several years before my own mediumship was to commence the very long process of development, I was privileged to sit on a few most memorable occasions with ‘Leslie Flint’ who was possibly the finest Direct Voice medium in history. </p>
<p>Readers will learn from communicators from the world beyond what the process of dying was actually like for them.                                                                                                                      The surroundings they found themselves in and what they personally experienced after death and more. As Leo Bonomo states in the books dedication: ‘This knowledge will enhance your entrance into Spirit when the time comes, it will change forever your views on what happens and the comfort that it gives is inestimable’,</p>
<p>Lyn Gibb De Swarte</p>
<p>I have had a happy time reading and listening to the recordings from the Leslie Flint seances. The book deserves all the publicity it can get. A worthy and important publication that provides excellent and simple proof of individual human survival in another dimension for all who are born on earth after physical death. Leo Bonomo is to be congratulated on his hard work that presents a positive picture of mediumship and the Spiritualist religion, its philosophy and scientific principles that it underpins.

<p>Jock Brocas – Evidential Medium, Author, Founder Of ASSMPI/ISSMPI, and Paranormal Researcher</p>
<p>This is a book that should be on every mediums shelf and in the hearts of humanity. It is not a story, these are lessons direct from the minds and voices of those on the other side of life. Listen, be touched and open your heart to the truth of the world unseen. I applaud my dear friend for this work and know the passion that he has for the teachings are reflected in that same passion Flint had to serve humanity.</p>
<p>Kia Muegge Physical Medium</p>
<p>For his new book or better Multimedia-Release, well-known Author and Radio Host Leo Bonomo could not have chosen a more interesting subject - amongst the vast subjects in the field of Spiritualism or Mediumship. </p>
<p>It is about an outstanding medium, one of a kind we have read in the parapsychological history books about, but no truly convincing evidence was available for this rare kind of Physical Mediumship until we get to Leos subject 'Leslie Flint’.</p>
<p>Sophia Psarakis - Biographer to Susan Nicholson - International Medium</p>
<p>As a gifted psychic with a warm and gentle disposition, Leo Bonomo has spent several decades honing his phenomenal mediumship abilities here in the United Kingdom. With the capacity to channel information from higher realms, Bonomo always knew that there was an unprecedented tale to be told from the perspective of the spirit world about the mysteries of the great beyond. In his latest works, Bonomo transcribes some of the many recordings of Leslie Flint which tells of the exceptional story for the ages held together with a depth of spiritual effervescence. A collection of transcripts derived from conservations with spirit, which are recorded for posterity, it essentially details the plight of the human condition, the journey of the soul through its earthly incarnation, and offers answers to the age-old questions we all delve into when we eventually awaken to our truth. His transcription honour the individuality of each spirit giving a unique voice and energy to those whose messages are channeled. It is a rare insight into the world beyond the veil and should be considered as essential reading for anyone wishing to learn more about one’s spiritual path here on Earth and in the ether.</p>
<p>I have verified, audio testing from a top Forensic company, Primeau Forensics. primeauforensics.com </p>
<p>On forensic investigation, I am pleased to report that the voice you can hear in the audio coming through the mediumship of Leslie Flint, and claiming to be Sir Winston Churchill himself, was found to have voice traits match with a confidence level over 99%. This, to me, suggests Primeau Forensics have indicated a strong case of the existence of life after death. What is so special about this is that ‘the recording’ was made 22 years after Sir Winston’s death!  </p>

<p>There are several major figures in the world of mediumship that have fully endorsed and been kind enough to review the book. These reviews are on my Blog page under the title ""IndieGoGo Campaign"". When you see people like Leslie Kean, Investigative and respected journalist and an author herself, pre-ordering you know this book will be sensational. I am already on the merest whisper taking many pre-orders. </p>
<p>Take some time to think about the world-changing and life-changing aspects of this work because after all,  History is being made. Be part of it. </p>
<p>Further, no Scientist will ever say something is 100%. However,  the statement from Primeau Forensics is good enough for me as it is indeed promising “found it more than a thousand times more likely that the voices are from the same person”. Take a read below… </p>
<p>“The voice identification investigations we perform are based on the accepted best practices and procedures set forth by the scientific community. The methodology is based on science and therefore is repeatable to ensure that the results are accurate and reproducible. We understand the weight that our conclusions may have in litigation and therefore give the utmost attention to detail for every investigation”. </p>
<p>“Overall, our test results state that the likelihood of the two voices belonging to the same person is slightly higher than the likelihood that they come from different people”. </p>
<p>“Looking at the individual testing methods, two of the tests concluded that it is slightly more likely that the voices are different. The other test found it more than a thousand times more likely that the voices are from the same person”. </p>
<p>The test that concluded the voices were the same used the Spectral-Formant (SF) method. This method is based on the theory that the structure of each person’s vocal cords are unique and produce unique qualities in the voice that can be measured. It is possible that the qualities measured by this method do not change as a person ages while the qualities measured by the other methods do. This is just a theory with no scientific backing, but if true, it could explain why the SF method seems to be an outlier in these results. </p>

<p>This is not a gift I can claim for myself, nothing can be done without Spirit’s help whatever “gifts” a person claims. So much is unclear to so many about the process of survival. Not many have heard of Direct Voice Mediumship without too much detail (it is in the book) but what you read and hear,  are those we call “The dead”. In other words, they speak to us from that realm,  in their own voices, a they would on Earth when they were here.  </p>
<p>There are 24 voice recordings with this book. Some famous, and others just like us!, all connecting to us lucidly and in their informative, and often humorous and witty ways as they would in their own voices during their ‘Earthly daily lives’ when they were once walking beside us, The recordings are often them answering questions that we find important, giving of their own experiences not just of passing which is important to us here, but of their experiences of where they found themselves and what they do now perhaps more importantly. The length of recordings are more than 20 minutes each. </p>
<p>We can change history. We can make such a difference to peoples lives who have felt tragedy truly believing their loved ones have gone for good. We have a chance to heal and understand. Think about how many will change their lives when we can be good to one another if we truly understand. Who knows perhaps we can stop wars and exploitation? Is there anything more important? </p>
<p>Now on a final note  I give appreciation to the following quotes: </p>
<p>""Every test capable of establishing Survival has been successfully demonstrated. There are tens of thousands of books written by people of unimpeachable integrity recording this evidence.""       Maurice Barbanell, Power of the Spirit, 1949 </p>
<p>Death has no power to separate those whom love has joined together and made them one in spirit.      Silver Birch, guide to Hanna Swaffer. </p>

<p>Aims   </p>
<p>My aim is to deliver 7,000 books for the first print run then reprint a second and third edition which I fully expect to achieve…  I am already taking pre-orders and this only on merest whispers and no real advertising done yet, with nearly a hundred some have ordered multi copies.  </p>
<p>Most books of this genre are around 60,000 words. This one is over 102,000 part of the reason the book is slightly more expensive it runs to 723 pages with pictures.</p>
<p> I have already put over £7,000 thousand of my own money into this project and worked hard in arranging proofreading, and translation work from those who understand the importance of this work. Outgoings so far involve costs for Forensics £3500. </p>
<p>Cleaning up recordings and transcribing ( approx a couple of hours per 20 mins of transcription work) and it takes time for research, calls, advices for translations, etc, have not been added. It has taken just over 10 years work so far. These costs I have so far absorbed.</p>
<p>Further costs required include:  1)     Printing, £14,700   </p>
<p>2)     Marketing, £4800  There will be other incidental costs such as radio advertising, membership, of sites connected to Nielsen’s to help distribute/advertise and also cost to amazon for promotion and to move up to business level, currently £39 per month. This is if I am blessed with going over the target.</p>
<p>3, Forensics £3500</p>
<p>This book will be printed. No matter what happens. </p>
<p>On a final note I have decided, with good advice, to print my own book and keep control of the costs myself which also includes outgoings such as shipping and storage. For example, Palamedes, a well-known worldwide Marketing company, <a href=""https://www.palamedes.co.uk%C2%A0has"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.palamedes.co.uk&amp;nbsp;has</a> agreed to a strategy costing £4800 with guaranteed 3 radio interviews and the potential for TV interviews. And that is just for the marketing side of things. This decision is to ensure I can keep costs down to deliver a world changing book in the quest to heighten awareness to the concept that, ‘we don’t die’.  </p>
<p>How you can help if you can’t donate. Please spread the word through your own media, FB, Twitter, instagram, etc. You can still be a big part of this huge event that can change so many lives. This is not about me or “my book” this is about giving to others to help relieve pain and anxiety that those who have lost loved ones have not lost in vain. </p>
<p>Perks... I have an exclusive contract to produce this work and the series of books to follow from over 6,000 recordings. You will have priority buying rights and up to 75% discount on future books. Everyone will be named on a list of honour on the web site.</p>

<h3>The Future is Accessible</h3>
<p>Imagine: you enter a bookstore through an accessible main entrance (this is a vision, after all). You ask for the hiking guides, and the bookseller directs you to a wall of titles. You are expecting to sort through dozens of books to gather minimal information for an upcoming trip. But amidst all of the usual imprints, one title catches your eye… <i>The Disabled Hiker’s Guide</i>… you take it off the shelf and see a cover photo of people using various mobility aids on a trail – people that look like you. You flip through the book, scanning the trail listings, and realize this book has all of the information you were hoping for and more.</p>
<h3>The Disabled Hiker's Guide</h3>
<p><i>The Disabled Hiker’s Guide to Western Washington and Oregon: 60 outdoor adventures accessible by car, wheelchair, and foot</i> <strong>elevates the needs of disabled folks and brings diverse disability representation to the outdoor publishing industry. </strong>It will be the first book of its kind to consider the diverse needs of disabled people in the outdoors. The book will remove one of the barriers to access -- a lack of information – by utilizing a difficulty rating system and detailed trail information designed for the disability community. </p>
<p>This groundbreaking guidebook will feature 60 outdoor adventures, including approximately:</p>
<ul>
<li> 20% drive-up experiences</li>
<li> 20% wheelchair accessible trails</li>
<li> 50% trails in the 1-3 difficulty rating</li>
<li> 10% in the 4-5 difficulty rating. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><i>The Disabled Hiker’s Guide</i> will also contain additional hiking tips, resources, and Indigenous land acknowledgments and information. This flagship book sets a precedent for more guides written by disabled hikers for disabled hikers.</p>
<p>Even though the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), which governs accessibility of federally-funded built environments, is over 50 years old, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is celebrating its 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary, people with disabilities continue to experience barriers to access in the outdoors. Many parks are just now conducting accessibility evaluations as required by law. Even the outdoors diversity, equity, and inclusion movement often fails to include disabled people in its activism. It is time for a change.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Meet Syren Nagakyrie</h3>
<p>As the founder of the Disabled Hikers organization, I have dedicated the past two years to building disability community and justice in the outdoors by writing trail guides, leading events, and advocating for accessibility and inclusion. I am a professional writer and community organizer with nearly 20 years experience. I also have multiple invisible disabilities, including Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, chronic fatigue, and PTSD and depression. I have worked with people who have a variety of physical and mental disabilities, chronic illnesses, and mental illnesses.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>Writing a guidebook of this nature for our community is quite an intensive project, and it will require the majority of my time, money, and spoons over the next nine months. </p>
<p>I will be traveling a minimum of 60 days this year, covering all of Washington and Oregon west of the Pacific Crest. But because of my chronic illness/disabilities, I can’t travel all at once. I am planning to alternate up to two weeks away and a week home. My time at home will be spent writing and recuperating in preparation for the next trip. <strong>I won’t be able to work or do much of anything else this year – just travel, hike, write, rest, repeat.</strong> I have until December 1 to complete the book.</p>
<p>As you may know, authors don’t make much money from their books, and hardly anything prior to the book’s publication. My advance won’t even cover assessment tools and hiking supplies. That’s where you come in. If you value the creation of resources for people with disabilities, if you want to support marginalized communities in the outdoors while showing the outdoor industry that all disabled folks deserve to be acknowledged, I hope you will consider supporting this fundraiser. </p>
<p><strong>Here is the budget breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul><li>$6,000 = Travel Expenses</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">In order to assess the trails for this book, I will need to drive up to 10,000 miles. I will primarily be traveling in an RV and camping/boondocking.

<ul><li>$1,000 = Assessment Tools &amp; Hiking Supplies</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">Providing accurate trail statistics requires specialized assessment tools, which I need to purchase.

<h3>Lets Build the Future Together</h3>
<p>With your fundraising help to make this book all that it can be, Falcon Guides will publish <i>The Disabled Hiker’s Guide to Western Washington and Oregon: 60 outdoor adventures accessible by car, wheelchair, and foot</i> in 2021.  <strong>Your early and ongoing support ensures this book will be the first in a series of Disabled Hiker's Guides.</strong> Lets show up together for more representation and resources for disabled people in the outdoors. I can’t wait to see this groundbreaking book sitting on a shelf next to all of the other guidebooks! Thank you for your support in bringing it to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Your financial support helps me complete <i>The Disabled Hiker’s Guide</i> regardless of how much money we raise together. I am contractually obligated to complete the book, so it is being written one way or another. As a poor, queer disabled person I have very limited resources, and <strong>I am risking going into debt to provide this resource to our community</strong>. Your generous support will allow me to avoid that. </p>
<p>The intensity of this project is going to be challenging, but my travel plans reduce the strain on my body. Traveling for a week then going home for a week costs more, but adapting plans to meet the needs of disabled bodies is a part of building an accessible future.  Your support helps normalize this crip approach to travel.</p>
<p>Of course, as Corvid-19 spreads I may need to adjust my plans. The book will still be completed this year, and I am taking all precautions to protect myself and others while traveling.</p>

Imagine: you enter a bookstore through an accessible main entrance (this is a vision, after all). You ask for the hiking guides, and the bookseller directs you to a wall of titles. You are expecting to sort through dozens of books to gather minimal information for an upcoming trip. But amidst all of the usual imprints, one title catches your eye… The Disabled Hiker’s Guide… you take it off the shelf and see a cover photo of people using various mobility aids on a trail – people that look like you. You flip through the book, scanning the trail listings, and realize this book has all of the information you were hoping for and more.
The Disabled Hiker's Guide
The Disabled Hiker’s Guide to Western Washington and Oregon: 60 outdoor adventures accessible by car, wheelchair, and foot elevates the needs of disabled folks and brings diverse disability representation to the outdoor publishing industry. It will be the first book of its kind to consider the diverse needs of disabled people in the outdoors. The book will remove one of the barriers to access -- a lack of information – by utilizing a difficulty rating system and detailed trail information designed for the disability community. 
This groundbreaking guidebook will feature 60 outdoor adventures, including approximately:

 20% drive-up experiences
 20% wheelchair accessible trails
 50% trails in the 1-3 difficulty rating
 10% in the 4-5 difficulty rating. 

 
The Disabled Hiker’s Guide will also contain additional hiking tips, resources, and Indigenous land acknowledgments and information. This flagship book sets a precedent for more guides written by disabled hikers for disabled hikers.
Even though the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA), which governs accessibility of federally-funded built environments, is over 50 years old, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is celebrating its 30th anniversary, people with disabilities continue to experience barriers to access in the outdoors. Many parks are just now conducting accessibility evaluations as required by law. Even the outdoors diversity, equity, and inclusion movement often fails to include disabled people in its activism. It is time for a change. 
Meet Syren Nagakyrie
As the founder of the Disabled Hikers organization, I have dedicated the past two years to building disability community and justice in the outdoors by writing trail guides, leading events, and advocating for accessibility and inclusion. I am a professional writer and community organizer with nearly 20 years experience. I also have multiple invisible disabilities, including Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, chronic fatigue, and PTSD and depression. I have worked with people who have a variety of physical and mental disabilities, chronic illnesses, and mental illnesses.

<p><i>That Girl on TV Could be Me</i><i>! The Journey of a Latina News Anchor</i> will be a storybook that inspires everyone!</p>
<p>It will be the first English children’s picture book on making a career in broadcast TV news... all from a Latinx perspective! Plus it will be bilingual in Spanish.</p>
<p>In 2020, Latinos comprise almost 20% of the US population.<br/> - but only 5% of American children’s books feature Latino characters.</p>
<p>In 1990, Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop coined the phrase “Windows, Mirrors and Sliding Glass Doors” as she stated that reading books enables children to learn about other’s lives, see themselves, and imagine their potential.<br/><br/>However, Dr. Bishop cautioned, ""When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative, or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part.""</p>
<p>Today’s multicultural public deserves more of a voice and a presence. Americans are demanding better representation in politics, social institutions, and media.<br/><br/>Our newest children’s book comes at the right time.</p>

<p>This is the true life story of Leticia Ordaz.</p>
<p>Growing up near Sacramento, CA, little Leticia dreams of being a TV newscaster.<br/><br/>But no one on TV looks like her. This shy, small-town girl overcomes barriers, like her fear of public speaking, to become the first in her hardworking Mexican family to attend college.</p>

<p>Then, starting as an intern, she climbs the TV ladder, travels to different cities, and reports on a rainbow of stories.  Can she lands her dream job: working at her hometown Channel 3?<br/><br/>Join Leticia on her exciting journey to become a news anchor who inspires the next generation to aim high and represent their community.</p>
<p>Now an Emmy-nominated anchor on Channel 3 in Sacramento, California, Leticia is a local leader who personally encourages students. With your help, Leticia’s story will be a welcoming window, mirror, and door that inspires young readers of all backgrounds around the world.</p>

<p>Leaving Mexico, Leticia’s family immigrated to the US. Today, as America becomes a more diverse country every day, the current government tries to stop immigration, jeopardizing the lives of exiles, refugees, and dreamers, and inflames racial divisions.</p>
<p>Immigration is not just the foundation of America but also the lifeblood of the American Dream.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599438682/koa8eicmqse3e7govnjk.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>That Girl on TV</i> will be bilingual in Spanish.

<p>“It’s fitting that when Leticia Ordaz was accepted into California State University, Sacramento, she announced: ‘There’s no holding me back.’ A high school counselor had tried to persuade her to attend community college, and her parents were also hesitant about their daughter taking that leap.

An avid reader hoping to impart a love of books to her sons, as well as pass on a firm knowledge of the Spanish language, Ordaz had a hard time finding bilingual children’s books that featured positive Latinx characters. ‘Every book that I was reading to my child didn’t represent them,’ Ordaz said. ‘I was also translating on my own, because for the first two years of my babies’ lives I wanted to just speak to them in Spanish, because I wanted them to learn it.’ When her sons started reading, they began to question why no one looked like them in books. Ordaz remembered growing up and wanting to be a television journalist and encountering the same disconnect trying to find people that looked like her.”<br/>-<i> Sacramento Bee</i></p>

</div></div>","That Girl on TV Could be Me! The Journey of a Latina News Anchor will be a storybook that inspires everyone!
It will be the first English children’s picture book on making a career in broadcast TV news... all from a Latinx perspective! Plus it will be bilingual in Spanish.
In 2020, Latinos comprise almost 20% of the US population. - but only 5% of American children’s books feature Latino characters.
In 1990, Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop coined the phrase “Windows, Mirrors and Sliding Glass Doors” as she stated that reading books enables children to learn about other’s lives, see themselves, and imagine their potential.However, Dr. Bishop cautioned, ""When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative, or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part.""
Today’s multicultural public deserves more of a voice and a presence. Americans are demanding better representation in politics, social institutions, and media.Our newest children’s book comes at the right time.

This is the true life story of Leticia Ordaz.
Growing up near Sacramento, CA, little Leticia dreams of being a TV newscaster.But no one on TV looks like her. This shy, small-town girl overcomes barriers, like her fear of public speaking, to become the first in her hardworking Mexican family to attend college.

Then, starting as an intern, she climbs the TV ladder, travels to different cities, and reports on a rainbow of stories.  Can she lands her dream job: working at her hometown Channel 3?Join Leticia on her exciting journey to become a news anchor who inspires the next generation to aim high and represent their community.
Now an Emmy-nominated anchor on Channel 3 in Sacramento, California, Leticia is a local leader who personally encourages students. With your help, Leticia’s story will be a welcoming window, mirror, and door that inspires young readers of all backgrounds around the world.

Leaving Mexico, Leticia’s family immigrated to the US. Today, as America becomes a more diverse country every day, the current government tries to stop immigration, jeopardizing the lives of exiles, refugees, and dreamers, and inflames racial divisions.
Immigration is not just the foundation of America but also the lifeblood of the American Dream.That Girl on TV will be bilingual in Spanish. The Sacramento Bee wrote that Leticia “believes exposure to different languages is beneficial for all children, and Spanish speakers like her sons should be proud of their heritage and encouraged to speak and share their language freely.”

Leticia’s story reaffirms readers’ love of their own families.

It appreciates parents who work hard and sacrifice to help their children get ahead.
It values parents’ support of their children to overcome hurdles and set goals.
It cherishes education: studying can lead not only to good grades but also to good work habits, confidence, and independent achievement.
It demonstrates how a family’s love is essential, eternal, and worth coming back home for.


As a girl, Leticia saw no Latinx role models on TV. But as an adult she had mentors and colleagues who gave her career advice. Now Leticia provides all this for young readers.
This breakthrough storybook spotlights a career that has never been the subject of American children’s literature. But it also explores an industry that we see every day but take for granted.
The average American watches nearly 4 hours of TV a day.- but do they know how a program is made?

That Girl on TV Could be Me shows how content is created by reporters, producers, camera operators, and more.  It includes a glossary of dozens of TV terms.
People of color are almost 40% of the US population, but only 26% of the TV workforce.- If you can’t make TV programs, how can you be in TV programs?
Representation matters. Books matter. And both especially matter for kids.
We're eager to send you a beautiful and enlightening book. The dynamic art is by the talented Juan Calle. Drawn in an appealing comic book style, Juan's illustrations bring Leticia’s exciting adventure to life. Kids will love the characters’ expressions and emotions. Adults will appreciate how doing a job you love takes passion, dedication, and a healthy dose of good humor.

The finished children’s book will be:- hardcover with dust jacket- 8.5 inches wide x 10.5 inches tall- 40 pages full color
That Girl on TV Could be Me brings you behind-the-scenes and then puts you in the front row as the action leaps off the page. This is a substantive storytime for homeschooling educators, teachers, and librarians. Ideal for ESL, bilingual, and Spanish immersion programs, it is also provides timeless lessons for all child and parents. Though the obstacles may be many, we can help each other make our dearest dreams come true.

Leticia Ordaz is an Emmy-nominated TV anchor at Channel 3 in Sacramento, CA.  A journalist for more than 20 years for television stations in Nevada and California, she is married with two young sons. Her family lives in Sacramento, CA. Leticia is a member of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, and California Chicano News Media Association.
Juan Calle created the critically-acclaimed Spanish bilingual storybook Good Dream, Bad Dream: The World's Heroes Save the Night! He illustrated The Asian Hall of Fame series (The Discovery of Ramen, Fireworks & Gunpowder, Anime & Manga), and The Year of the Rooster. He leads the art studio Liberum Donum in Bogota, Colombia.
That Girl on TV Could be Me will be published by Immedium, a leading independent press in San Francisco, CA. Immedium published the original stories of The Octonauts which inspired the hit animated TV series worldwide. 40% of their titles feature multicultural themes and characters. 25% of their titles are bilingual.

“It’s fitting that when Leticia Ordaz was accepted into California State University, Sacramento, she announced: ‘There’s no holding me back.’ A high school counselor had tried to persuade her to attend community college, and her parents were also hesitant about their daughter taking that leap. But she was resolved to attend a university and become a journalist.”- Stockton Record

</div></div>","Why I Write 

 During an annual Lets-Figure-Out-Your-Life session, a dear friend asked me what I am most passionate about. 



""A lot of things,"" I said. I am passionate about kids within the welfare/state custody system. I am passionate about disaster relief, about humanitarian work, about the worldwide water crisis. I guess more than anything I am passionate about writing--because it can encompass all of those things. 


It is how I tell the world what I have seen.

What started out as a sort of ""Christian Inspiration"" piece that I began writing during my 6-month stint in Uganda, East Africa, eventually became a travel memoir/spiritual journey. It evolved from a strictly biblical approach, to a sort of ""what do I believe in, and how does that affect how I love God and others?""


wOnderlust is about what we don't know. It's about accepting that we know much less than we think we do--specifically, about God. It's about lessons learned and Truths discovered and questions unanswered. It's about the orphan children of Uganda, the welfare children of Missouri, the abortion rights activists of Fayetteville, Arkansas. It's about life in Korea, surviving St. Louis, and questioning what I grew up believing all along the way. 

It's a story I would love to share with you. 


What I Need To Make This Happen

 I am self-publising this book and it will be available on eBook as well as in hard copy format. 
The total cost? 
$4,000
I would greatly appreciate your support either monetarily, through sharing via social media, word of mouth, or all of the above!
Risks & Challenges
 This is scary. 
I have been writing this piece for five years, and avoiding an attempt at publishing for quite some time. Why? 
Because What if I fail?
Isn't that the question that crushes us all? How many times have you not pursued a dream because the fear of failure paralyzed you to the point of complete inaction?

Nothing is safe. 
But everything worth anything is worth pursuing anyway.

<p>The interesting side effect is that even with these errors, first printings of many books become highly collectible because only a limited number exist. For our first issue, we printed 250 copies before making corrections. For our second, just 500 were printed on the first run. We anticipate each of our next first-run printings to be between 500 and 1,000 copies <u>at most</u>. Of course we’ll print more as justified by demand, but there will never be a second “first run”!</p>

Her new book for younger readers—the first in a series—was enthusiastically picked up by Disney-Hyperion and will be released in early 2016.</p>
<p>In <i>Momotaro: Xander and the Lost Island of Monsters</i>, young Xander Miyamoto would rather do anything other than listen to his sixth-grade teacher drone on about weather. But when Xander’s father disappears in an unexpected storm, the boy embarks on an epic journey to find him, and in the process—guided only by a comic book as a guide against acid waterfalls, angry giants, volcanoes, and more—discovers that he’s the latest in a line of Momotaro heroes.</p>

<p><strong>How the book is connected to this campaign</strong>: I first met Margaret in 1992 at the California State Summer School for the Arts when we were both students there, and reached out after purchasing her first novel a few years ago. When she announced <i>Momotaro</i> last year, she also mentioned that Choong Yoon was doing the book’s cover art. That led to me contact the same artist to inquire about a commission for Ember—resulting in the perfect cover for our Fall 2015 issue.</p>
<p>Disney-Hyperion has donated 10 copies of <i>Momotaro: Xander and the Lost Island of Monsters</i> to this fundraiser, and Margaret Dilloway has graciously agreed to sign them for you! The book itself will retail for $17 in April 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong> When you select this perk, you may also choose a copy of any issue of <i>Ember: A Journal of Luminous Things.</i></p>

<p><i>Ember</i> contributors receive an offer of 2¢ per word (or $20 per work, whichever is more). That’s what is known in the industry as “semi-pro” pay rate, and while it’s important that authors are paid for their work, it’s really not much. If we meet our fundraising goal, however, we’ll be able start offering professional rates to all contributors.</p>
<p>If you’re not a writer, you may wonder why you should know or care what we pay our authors and poets. While there are many good reasons, it comes down to these two: <i>quality content</i> and <i>fulfilling our mission</i>.</p>
<p><strong>Quality Content</strong>: When we pay professional rates, we attract even better stories and poems for you to read.</p>
<p><strong>Fulfilling our Mission</strong>: What better way to foster and encourage talented writers than by paying them a rate that demonstrates the value of their work? When we pay new writers the same rate as established pros, we send a clear message that we recognize the quality of their work and value of their talent.</p>

    Each volume of
    Ember contains two issues: Fall and Spring. Volume 2 has firm shipping dates of late October 2015 and late April 2016. The content and artwork of the Fall 2015 issue are complete, and we’re working on final editing and layout.





    One of the most exciting things about each issue is the opportunity to feature work from young writers in addition to great stories for young readers. Our Issue 1 lineup includes six contributors aged 18 or under, designated below by the
    Ember quill:

        We want each issue of Ember to 
        be exquisite—a true work of literary and visual art. The cover art for this issue is a custom commission from artist and illustrator Choong Yoon, created just for us!
    










        Reprising her role as Ember illustrator, Casey Robin (www.caseyrobin.com) has created beautiful and unique illustrations for our Fall 2015 issue. Here are just a few of them—can you guess which stories and poems they belong to?
    








    Right now we are polishing the Fall issue for publication, but we’re already hard at work picking the selections for Spring, too! We will update this list as it grows, but here are the first pieces already accepted:





“Black Tears in Heaven” by
        Dany G. Zuwen

“Stockholm Syndrome” by Anne Lawrence Bradshaw

“A Tibetan Epistle” by
        Sreyash Sarkar

“Close to Tomorrow” by
        Emily McCosh


“The Spider Shows You How” by
        Nels Hanson

“Bury the Pages” by
        S. Thomas Summers

“Grandma’s Leather Sofa” by
        Shannon Lawrence

“Vacated Plots” by
        Liesl Nunns

“The Panoptimom” by
        Erica L. Satifka








        Sean Greenberg’s “The Carrot is Mightier than the Sword” is one of my favorite paintings, and Sean agreed to expand the original into a full landscape illustration that will wrap around the book.
    










        Why mess with perfection? I love working with Casey Robin, and I look forward to featuring her amazing illustrations in Spring 2016, too.
    
 




All sponsors of this campaign (at every level) get digital full-color copies of our first four issues in PDF format.








Value: $25 / Your Donation: $10 — Despite best efforts to ensure quality, the first print run of any book often contains errors that are corrected in subsequent printings.
The interesting side effect is that even with these errors, first printings of many books become highly collectible because only a limited number exist. For our first issue, we printed 250 copies before making corrections. For our second, just 500 were printed on the first run. We anticipate each of our next first-run printings to be between 500 and 1,000 copies at most. Of course we’ll print more as justified by demand, but there will never be a second “first run”!









The next 100 funders can choose a signed First Printing copy of one issue of Ember for just $10—that’s a $25 value.
A note on availability: Volume 1 Issue 1 (Fall 2014) first printings are sold out. Volume 1 Issue 2 (Spring 2015) has about 100 copies left from the initial run of 500. We will create between 250 and 1,000 copies for each of the Volume 2 issues, depending on the demand from this campaign.






Margaret Dilloway is the award-winning author of Sisters of Heart and Snow, The Care and Handling of Roses With Thorns, and How to Be an American Housewife. Her new book for younger readers—the first in a series—was enthusiastically picked up by Disney-Hyperion and will be released in early 2016.
In Momotaro: Xander and the Lost Island of Monsters, young Xander Miyamoto would rather do anything other than listen to his sixth-grade teacher drone on about weather. But when Xander’s father disappears in an unexpected storm, the boy embarks on an epic journey to find him, and in the process—guided only by a comic book as a guide against acid waterfalls, angry giants, volcanoes, and more—discovers that he’s the latest in a line of Momotaro heroes.











How the book is connected to this campaign: I first met Margaret in 1992 at the California State Summer School for the Arts when we were both students there, and reached out after purchasing her first novel a few years ago. When she announced Momotaro last year, she also mentioned that Choong Yoon was doing the book’s cover art. That led to me contact the same artist to inquire about a commission for Ember—resulting in the perfect cover for our Fall 2015 issue.
Disney-Hyperion has donated 10 copies of Momotaro: Xander and the Lost Island of Monsters to this fundraiser, and Margaret Dilloway has graciously agreed to sign them for you! The book itself will retail for $17 in April 2016.
Bonus: When you select this perk, you may also choose a copy of any issue of Ember: A Journal of Luminous Things.






Authors and poets with work in our first four issues, together with selected staff at Ember, have created an eBook of writing prompts to inspire you on your own creative journey! Sentences, scenes, paragraphs, and instructions, this collection is sure to unleash your imagination. Which is why, not coincidentally, we’ve asked Enkel Dika to use his artwork “Unleashed Imagination” as the digital cover for this book of writing prompts!
The list of contributing authors and poets who are providing these prompts will grow, but the participants so far include:

Here are some details on where the money goes.



Ember contributors receive an offer of 2¢ per word (or $20 per work, whichever is more). That’s what is known in the industry as “semi-pro” pay rate, and while it’s important that authors are paid for their work, it’s really not much. If we meet our fundraising goal, however, we’ll be able start offering professional rates to all contributors.
If you’re not a writer, you may wonder why you should know or care what we pay our authors and poets. While there are many good reasons, it comes down to these two: quality content and fulfilling our mission.
Quality Content: When we pay professional rates, we attract even better stories and poems for you to read.
Fulfilling our Mission: What better way to foster and encourage talented writers than by paying them a rate that demonstrates the value of their work? When we pay new writers the same rate as established pros, we send a clear message that we recognize the quality of their work and value of their talent.



There’s a reason each issue looks so good! From cover art to interior illustrations, every collection’s artwork is vibrant and engaging. So far, we’ve worked with James R. Eads, Keliana Tayler, Choong Yoon, Sean Greenberg, and Casey Robin—always contracting with the best artists to get the best work at the best price.



To ensure the highest quality presentation possible, we work with Alexander’s Print Advantage to create a perfect full-color trade paperback on sturdy, coated paper. The illustrations are crisp and the book feels great, too! 
At E&GJ Press, we’ve been working with Alexander’s Print Advantage for about three years and have consitently enjoyed personal customer service, great prices, and top-tier printing expertise.



Don’t worry, I’ll cover these expenses—they are not coming out of this fundraiser—but I want to at least disclose what some of them are.

Actually ... no. 
No one on the Ember staff is paid, including me. Everything you see is the work of a team of amazing volunteers who handle everything from reading manuscripts to sending responses to typesetting to marketing.
I’d actually like to change my volunteers to paid employees, and I certainly welcome your contributions toward making it happen, but paying the Ember staff is not part of this fundraiser. If you’d like to help me thank these volunteers, or if you’d like to join them, please contact me at editor@egjpress.org.



This campaign comes on the heels of our first-year collection, which contained forty works in two issues ranging from delightful (like “Cat Tail” and “The Frog Who Swallowed the Moon”) to poignant (“The Precipice” and “The Anniversary”). 
We’ve shown that a collection with content appropriate for younger readers can be accessible but still provide challenge and stimulation for advanced students. 
That the stories in Ember can be enjoyed by adults. 
That our products are beautiful and high-quality publications.




To underscore that, and in the hope that you’ll be as excited as I am (and convinced to support this fundraiser), I’m offering you both of our Volume 1 issues free in PDF format just for taking the time to listen. Simply click on the covers above to download your digital copy!",92.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Do you love to read but hate the cost that comes with
purchasing books? Do you avoid the library or just don’t have the time? Do you
have a stack of books collecting dust because you didn’t enjoy them, have only
read them once (not even all the way through), and don’t have the heart to
throw them out? Are you running out of room in your apartment for all the books
you’ve bought, or is the lack of space forcing you into e-books? Do you love
the convenience of e-books but miss the feeling of paper between your fingers?</p>
<p><b><font color=""006EB8"">Curious Codex</font></b> is hoping to save you from all of the hassle
by creating a rental service that will make getting a print book convenient and
inexpensive. We are looking to revolutionize the book subscription
market by creating a cost-efficient, customer-focused book rental service that
will allow subscribers to choose from a variety of plans at various
price-points. All of these plans will allow you to rent an unlimited number of books
per month without consequence - if you only have the time to read one
book over the course of a month, or even two, it’ll still be affordable.</p>
<p>Don’t know what to read? Let us pick a book for you! With
our “Curated Plan,” we’ll pick a book based on your preferences that we think
you’ll enjoy reading. We won’t be charging you a premium for this plan; it’ll
actually be our most cost-efficient option. All we ask is that you be a little
bit curious!</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434028380/fr9jbguaqud6nfyffc1b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p><p>As New Yorkers, founders Andy Cox and Kat Wood know how hard
it is to live in a small New York City apartment while maintaining an enormous
book collection. However, this problem is not limited to New York City or tiny apartments - homes can only accommodate so many bookshelves at once, if any! Visiting the library isn’t always a
convenience, considering there are often crowds, long lines, and visits can be quite time
consuming, and they usually don’t have the book you want and it can take several weeks to get it! While we are not
looking to compete with libraries in general – after all, they offer more
services than renting books - we are merely trying to
provide a service for people who don’t want to take time out of their day to
head to a library.</p>
<p>E-books are a fantastic alternative for city-dwellers and
suburbanites alike, but after staring at a computer screen at work all
day, who wants to stare at a tablet? And we can’t be the only ones who, when
readjusting ourselves while reading on a tablet, accidentally move several
pages from where we were – talk about losing the moment. There’s just something
about a book in your hands that brings reading to life in a way that tablets do
not. We get it, e-books are great (we own them!) but we are well aware that
some people prefer physical books to e-books. With the creation of Curious
Codex, we hope to bring the same convenience of e-books to print-lovers in a
different capacity.</p>
<p>Lastly, we understand the struggle that comes with finding a
quality book. We love recommending books to our friends and family, and we are
often praised for our suggestions. We understand what goes into connecting a
reader to a quality book – and we hope to pass this on to you!</p><p><br/></p><p></p>

two readers, as they can rotate the three books, and they can either choose to
share the books or send them back once one person has finished reading, and
this plan will almost always allow both readers to have another book at hand!</p><p>For

book or New York City-related. Love a book by an author and want to know more
about them and their other works? We can get you more information. Want to buy a book for a friend who likes
Science-Fiction, but not sure what they’d like? We can give you list of great
books with detailed recommendations for you to choose from. Want to find a cute

back. We thank you!</p>
<p>A $2,000
or more donation easily warrants a lifetime subscription to Curious Codex. It
is a lot of money, but it easily makes it possible for us to launch, no matter
what! As long as Andy and Kat remain the owners of Curious Codex, you will

<h3><b><font color=""006EB8"">How your money will be used:</font></b></h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b><font color=""CF0000"">BOOKS:</font></b> In order for
us to provide this service, we need to purchase quite a few books. Books don’t
come cheap. After all, that is one of the many reasons we’re looking to provide
this service. In order for us to receive bulk pricing, we must buy books in
bulk; therefore, we need a significant amount of money. To purchase the initial
amount of books we expect to need at launch, we will need to spend roughly
$5,000 - $7,500. This amount will go up significantly if there is more demand
than we are expecting. If, for example, 5,000 people donate to this campaign
with the intention of using our service once we have launch, we will need over
5,000 books, which would cost us roughly $50,000 - $75,000, at the very bare
minimum! Since we are renting and reusing books, our long-term cost for books
will go down significantly, but the initial cost, as you can
see, is very high.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><font color=""CF0000"">PACKAGING:</font></b> In
order to provide an efficient service, we need to create packaging that will
prevent the books from being damaged, possesses the ability to fit in mailboxes
of various sizes, and it must serve as a means of returning the book when done
reading. As this is a task we cannot personally accomplish, we not only need to
have someone else design the packaging with our creative input, but we must
also make it possible for the packaging to be created and printed in bulk. We
already have several potential designs in mind, and have a good idea of how we
want the packaging to work with the primary goal being user-friendly packaging
and assuring the book is protected during shipping. All we need now is to work
with a professional to execute our plan, develop a means of creating the
packaging in a cost-efficient manner, and buying enough to have ready for our
launch date. Between the design, creation, and procurement of packaging, we
expect this to be roughly $10,000 - $15,000, if not more, if more people use
our service than expected at launch.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><font color=""CF0000"">WEBSITE:</font></b> While our
website will be simple for the initial launch, it will eventually need to be
able to support a vast database of books. The website needs to be
user-friendly, visually pleasing, but most of all, we want it to be an
enjoyable experience. While we have envisioned our dream website, we do not
have the technical knowledge or expertise to accomplish this (if you’ve headed
over to our current temporary website put together by Andy, our website
capabilities are extremely limited). We will have to find a web professional to
not only assist us in building the ultimate website, but to also help us
maintain the website as we grow. Website creation and maintenance can vary in
price, and we want to provide a unique, memorable, and painless experience. We
do not have a solid price point for our website, as it will be an ongoing cost
that will continue to increase in price. For our initial launch, which will
revolve around our Curated Plan, a simple website with a subscription-based
payment option would be easy to set up, would cost very little, and we would
only need to create an area within each user's profile for you to notify us of
your preferences. However, this isn’t the goal. We want a website where you
will lose yourself in a world of books and be able to explore books just like
getting lost in a library. Any “extra” money after books and packaging will
essentially be allocated into our website with the intention of achieving our
dream website sooner than later.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><font color=""CF0000"">STORAGE:</font></b> We live in
New York City, so we do not possess the space necessary to store a handful of
books in our apartments, let alone thousands of books. Initially, we will be
renting a storage unit to act as our warehouse, where all of our books and
packaging will be neatly organized. While we are first starting out, this will
cost us up to $50/month. We will also need a PO Box to initially gather all
return shipments. As we expand our collection, we will require more space,
which means we will need a larger, more expensive storage unit. Depending on how many
people use this service initially, we might just need a large office space that
doubles as a library right from the start. This will cost anywhere from $50 to
$3,000 per month.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><font color=""CF0000"">MORE BOOKS:</font></b> If we
are somehow able to exceed our $50,000 goal, are able to allocate extra funds
to areas that may require more (such as packaging and storage) accordingly, and
still manage to have an excess, all of that money will be invested into more
books! This will allow us to have a wider selection and we would then be able
expedite the release our “Chosen Plan” sooner than planned (pending the
completion of our website).</p><p><br/></p><p></p>
<h3><b><font color=""006EB8"">How we will use the funds if we don't reach our goal:</font></b></h3>
<p></p><p>We are adamant about launching Curious Codex and we will do
everything we can to make it happen, even if we don’t reach our goal. Our goal
is to use Indiegogo as a means of skipping a few steps, and as a result,
allowing up to create our dream website, permitting us to obtain thousands of
books from the get-go, and to launch a detailed library database; however, if
we do not manage to raise our goal amount of $50,000, we have other
alternatives in mind that will allow us to still launch this service, but will
require more time to forge ahead and provide every possible service we hope to
make available to our customers.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434029275/nkolnlfm56m1wfgcqfvo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><b><font color=""006EB8"">Services we will be providing at launch:</font></b></h3>
<p></p><p>Our rental service will be divided into two plans: “Curated”
and “Chosen.” The “Curated Plan” will be the only plan available at launch. For
the “Curated Plan,” a book will be selected by Curious Codex in regards to the
preferences set by the customer. This plan allows Curious Codex to cut the
costs of the subscription, as the books chosen will essentially be free of any
“demand.” If, for example, 20 people were to want the same book but only 5
copies are available, in most instances this would drive up the price of the item. However, this is a scenario that will never occur under the “Curated Plan,”
as there are several good books to choose from, therefore the books are
unaffected by inflation caused by demand and scarcity. This also gives Curious
Codex the opportunity to introduce a customer to a book or author that they
would not have otherwise come across. We just ask you be a little bit curious!</p>
<p>Since this plan allows us to provide books free of demand,
we are subsequently able to offer it at a lower cost, and unlike other curated
services, we are choosing to <b><font color=""54AE90"">not</font></b> charge a premium. We have not
yet finalized our pricing, but we expect the “1 book at a time” and “2 books at
a time” plans to BOTH be under $10 per month. We are also positive our “3 books
at a time” plan will be under $15, and our “5 books at a time” plan will fall
between just under $15 to under $20 per month.</p>
<p>Our prices for these subscription plans will be finalized
once we have finished calculating the price of packaging and shipping per book,
but we only expect there to be a dollar or two in fluctuation, if at all. <b><font color=""CF0000"">ALL
SHIPPING WILL BE FREE!</font></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><font color=""006EB8"">Services we want to provide in the near future:</font></b></h3>
<p></p><p><b><font color=""CF0000"">The
Chosen Plan: </font></b>This is our long-term goal for Curious
Codex. We will not be able to make this service available at launch due to the
cost necessary in creating a wide-enough and appealing collection of books. We
will be working diligently from the beginning to create an extensive online
library to allow this service to become available as quickly as possible.
We will also be taking suggestions from customers as to what books to include
in Curious Codex’s library, in addition to our list of favorites. Once we have
attained enough books and created a user-friendly website to release the
“Chosen Plan,” the service will function in a manner of a queue: customers will
be able to put together a list of books that they want, ranked in an order of priority,
and they will receive the books from Curious Codex in that order. The price for
this service will be more than that of the “Curated Plan” due to demand and
availability, as we will do everything possible to meet the demands of
subscribers regardless of availability, even if it means purchasing several
extra copies of a book. However, this service will only be $3-$5 more than the
“Curated Plan” – it will still be a smart and cost-efficient choice!</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><font color=""CF0000"">Monthly
Book Club: </font></b>Curious Codex is also interested in
creating and launching a “Monthly Book Club.” Several Monthly Book Clubs
already exist, but we hope to create a book club more focused on cost and
excellent reading material than monthly experiences. Current book clubs focus
on specific genres and provide additional bookish items that go along with
their monthly theme; however, as great as an experience they are, there is a
premium involved. Don’t get us wrong, we love monthly themed book clubs, but
not everyone can afford it or are interested in the themed goodies. Our Book
Club will be less about the packaging and items, and more about getting a
fantastic read without having to pay for the extras. This book club will be
curated, meaning we will pick your monthly book based on your preferences, and
there will be an option for used, paperback, or hardcover books. Prices have
not yet been finalized, but we expect them to be just around market value for
paperback and hardcover, and far less for used books. We expect this service to
become available shortly after launch.</p><p></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434029072/pdemd58nsxdtozqibknh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><b><font color=""006EB8"">Our Mission:</font></b></h3>
<p></p><p>Curious Codex’s mission is to provide an inclusive,
reasonably priced online book rental service that will allow subscribers to
access and explore books that we believe are exceptional, and that we truly believe
subscribers will enjoy. We hope to exceed expectations, to provide an
outstanding relationship between the company and its customers, to build a safe
and environmentally responsible culture, to be respectful at all times, and
most importantly, to display honesty and integrity in everything we do.
Ultimately, we hope to create a convenient and inexpensive service that will
motivate past readers to pick up and explore a book again.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b><font color=""006EB8"">Risks:</font></b></h3>
<p></p><p>We are aware and fully understand the likelihood that we
will send you a book you don’t like or have already read. If you aren’t a fan
of the book we’ve sent you, we will be providing an outlet for you to let us
know! While we will be unable to accommodate you for not liking the book, that
information will allow us to better understand your preferences and increase the probability of finding a book you’ll truly love. If we’ve sent you a book
you’ve already read and have no interest in rereading it, send it back and shoot
us an email, and we’ll prorate your account the amount of days it took the
book to leave our facility and get back (meaning, if for example, there were 7
days of travel time between the book getting to your home and back, we will
give you 7 additional days of the service for free).</p><p><br/></p>
<p>The “Curated Plan” is not a service made exclusively for the
adventurous reader – it is about opening yourself up to reading new and
different books. It doesn’t even have to be a completely different genre! Every
writer is different, and every dystopian or mystery novel has a different kind of
story that all fall under a different category. We will be picking books
based on your preferences, so if you only want to read steampunk, you will
definitely only be reading steampunk – though some might be based in London,
others in South Africa, or in a very distant post-apocalyptic future, unless
you’re specifically looking for it to just be based in Paris, then we will do
our best to find as many books that fit this criteria. Don’t have any
preferences whatsoever? Then expect to be dazzled by some of the greatest, most
obscure works out there! Just want to read some literary classics? We’ve got
you covered. Our “Curated Plan” is <b><font color=""54AE90"">NOT</font></b> a random book sent to
you – a lot of thought will be put into it!</p><p><br/></p>
<p>We will not only encourage you to provide feedback, but we
will also do our best to make various outlets available to do so. We want
Curious Codex to be about the customers and meeting their needs in order to
offer a great experience. We not only understand how important a good book is,
but also how important a good service is – and we are hoping to meld these two
things. Curious Codex is a new kind of service, and we are hoping you will help
us nurture it to help it grow into an exceptional service.</p><p><br/></p><p> </p>
<h3><strong><font color=""006EB8"">The Impact: </font></strong></h3><p>Our goal with Curious Codex is to build a new type of
service that will make books more easily accessible without paying a premium.
However, we don’t believe we are taking business away from libraries or book
stores. Libraries offer several other services and will provide other books
that we will not, such as cookbooks and technical books, and libraries act as
local archives and safe spaces. We also do not believe we are taking business
away from book stores. We’re letting you rent a book, but you will have to
return it at some point. If you enjoyed reading the book we’ve sent you, our
service will not stop you from going out and buying that book from your local
bookstore. This service is merely an alternative for those who cannot afford to be
constantly buying books, some of which they may end up not liking, or don’t have
the time or easy access to a library. We’re merely providing a convenient
service for everyone who wishes to read but does not have the necessary time or
effort that goes into finding a new book.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>We believe reading is integral to society. It is a means of
passing along knowledge and conveying a story that differs from our own. We
read to remember the past and to think up the future. Without books, cultures
and societies would not exist or be remembered. Books help shape who we are as
individuals, and introduce us to experiences we would have otherwise never
experienced. Books are important but are often priced as a luxury, and Curious
Codex is hoping to change this by providing an alternative to the traditional
model.</p><p><br/></p><p></p>

<p></p><p><b><font color=""CF0000"">Help
us spread the word! </font></b>We know that not everyone can

<p><font color=""CF0000""><b>Question:</b></font> Why are the perks for your subscription listed at $30/$60 for 3/6 months? Does that mean it will be $10 per month?</p>
<p><font color=""CF0000""><b>Answer:</b></font> We are asking for $10 per month for the perk for various reasons. The obvious reason is because we need as much money as possible to launch, and since our service is not yet in business, it will be a while before we are running efficiently. We also haven’t solidified our pricing, so we don’t want to charge too little and not have enough money to provide the service. The few extra dollars will essentially allow us to guarantee that this service will be launched. Once your 3 or 6 months of free service is over, you will be charged the cost of the subscription we have settled on, which will most likely be less than $10 per month. As a reward for donating the few extra dollars, people who purchase the $30 or $60 subscription perks are guaranteed access to Curious Codex at launch – so if an innumerable amount of people want to use our service, you will be assured first access.</p></div>","Do you love to read but hate the cost that comes with

market by creating a cost-efficient, customer-focused book rental service that
will allow subscribers to choose from a variety of plans at various
price-points. All of these plans will allow you to rent an unlimited number of books
per month without consequence - if you only have the time to read one
book over the course of a month, or even two, it’ll still be affordable.
Don’t know what to read? Let us pick a book for you! With
our “Curated Plan,” we’ll pick a book based on your preferences that we think
you’ll enjoy reading. We won’t be charging you a premium for this plan; it’ll
actually be our most cost-efficient option. All we ask is that you be a little
bit curious!
As New Yorkers, founders Andy Cox and Kat Wood know how hard
it is to live in a small New York City apartment while maintaining an enormous
book collection. However, this problem is not limited to New York City or tiny apartments - homes can only accommodate so many bookshelves at once, if any! Visiting the library isn’t always a
convenience, considering there are often crowds, long lines, and visits can be quite time
consuming, and they usually don’t have the book you want and it can take several weeks to get it! While we are not
looking to compete with libraries in general – after all, they offer more
services than renting books - we are merely trying to
provide a service for people who don’t want to take time out of their day to
head to a library.
E-books are a fantastic alternative for city-dwellers and
suburbanites alike, but after staring at a computer screen at work all
day, who wants to stare at a tablet? And we can’t be the only ones who, when
readjusting ourselves while reading on a tablet, accidentally move several
pages from where we were – talk about losing the moment. There’s just something
about a book in your hands that brings reading to life in a way that tablets do
not. We get it, e-books are great (we own them!) but we are well aware that
some people prefer physical books to e-books. With the creation of Curious
Codex, we hope to bring the same convenience of e-books to print-lovers in a
different capacity.
Lastly, we understand the struggle that comes with finding a
quality book. We love recommending books to our friends and family, and we are
often praised for our suggestions. We understand what goes into connecting a
reader to a quality book – and we hope to pass this on to you!

how the “two books” service will work: We will send you two books in their own
individual packaging, which will allow you to return them individually. This

your next book, as you will not have
to return them together!

books from our Founder's Bundle*, a handwritten thank you card, including a

first YEAR of our Curated Plan with
THREE books checked out at a time for free, and you will be featured on the ""About"" page of our website
once we have officially launched, and THE
FOUNDER'S WILL ALSO BE YOUR PERSONAL BOOK CONSULTANTS! Please see the $75 perk for a picture of the book strap.
Here’s
how the “three books” service will work: We will send you three books in their
own individual packaging, which will allow you to return them individually.
This service will essentially allow you to always
have at least one of our books, therefore letting you continue reading
without having to wait for your next book, and allowing you to even have a
backup, as you will not have to
return them together! This plan is also an optimal choice for a household of
two readers, as they can rotate the three books, and they can either choose to
share the books or send them back once one person has finished reading, and
this plan will almost always allow both readers to have another book at hand!For
donating $1,000 or more, your name or appropriate alias will be featured on our
“About” page, next to our own biographies! This is our way of making sure you’re
remembered for making Curious Codex happen!
What is
a Personal Book Consultant, you ask? For donating at least $1,000, you will gain
access to our personal emails, where you will be able to ask about anything
book or New York City-related. Love a book by an author and want to know more
about them and their other works? We can get you more information. Want to buy a book for a friend who likes
Science-Fiction, but not sure what they’d like? We can give you list of great
books with detailed recommendations for you to choose from. Want to find a cute
bookstore in NYC? We know plenty! Please
understand that this relationship can and will be terminated for any and all
inappropriate communication.
$2,000: You will receive everything listed in the $1,000 perk, but you will also receive a LIFETIME membership to our service. At
launch, this will be our Curated Plan
with FIVE books checked out at a time, with the option to switch over to the Chosen Plan once that service has
launched (we have no ETA at this time). By donating $2,000 or more, you have
guaranteed that this service will go live, so we will always be grateful, and
hope a lifetime membership to our service will suffice as a means of paying you
back. We thank you!
A $2,000
or more donation easily warrants a lifetime subscription to Curious Codex. It
is a lot of money, but it easily makes it possible for us to launch, no matter
what! As long as Andy and Kat remain the owners of Curious Codex, you will
receive our five books at a time, Curated or Chosen Plan, forever, and that’s
our promise to you!
*The Founder’s Bundle is a compilation of six books, three
from each founder, which they believe everyone should read at one point or
another. They’re not only some of our favorite books, but they are wonderful
reads!
**We will be sure to contact you regarding your preferences
if you are unable to let us know. If you are not receiving all six books from
the Founder’s Bundle, we want to make sure you are more likely to enjoy the two,
three, or four books you do receive!
How your money will be used:

BOOKS: In order for
us to provide this service, we need to purchase quite a few books. Books don’t
come cheap. After all, that is one of the many reasons we’re looking to provide
this service. In order for us to receive bulk pricing, we must buy books in
bulk; therefore, we need a significant amount of money. To purchase the initial
amount of books we expect to need at launch, we will need to spend roughly
$5,000 - $7,500. This amount will go up significantly if there is more demand
than we are expecting. If, for example, 5,000 people donate to this campaign
with the intention of using our service once we have launch, we will need over
5,000 books, which would cost us roughly $50,000 - $75,000, at the very bare
minimum! Since we are renting and reusing books, our long-term cost for books
will go down significantly, but the initial cost, as you can
see, is very high.
PACKAGING: In
order to provide an efficient service, we need to create packaging that will
prevent the books from being damaged, possesses the ability to fit in mailboxes
of various sizes, and it must serve as a means of returning the book when done
reading. As this is a task we cannot personally accomplish, we not only need to
have someone else design the packaging with our creative input, but we must
also make it possible for the packaging to be created and printed in bulk. We
already have several potential designs in mind, and have a good idea of how we
want the packaging to work with the primary goal being user-friendly packaging
and assuring the book is protected during shipping. All we need now is to work
with a professional to execute our plan, develop a means of creating the
packaging in a cost-efficient manner, and buying enough to have ready for our
launch date. Between the design, creation, and procurement of packaging, we
expect this to be roughly $10,000 - $15,000, if not more, if more people use
our service than expected at launch.
WEBSITE: While our
website will be simple for the initial launch, it will eventually need to be
able to support a vast database of books. The website needs to be
user-friendly, visually pleasing, but most of all, we want it to be an
enjoyable experience. While we have envisioned our dream website, we do not
have the technical knowledge or expertise to accomplish this (if you’ve headed
over to our current temporary website put together by Andy, our website
capabilities are extremely limited). We will have to find a web professional to
not only assist us in building the ultimate website, but to also help us
maintain the website as we grow. Website creation and maintenance can vary in
price, and we want to provide a unique, memorable, and painless experience. We
do not have a solid price point for our website, as it will be an ongoing cost
that will continue to increase in price. For our initial launch, which will
revolve around our Curated Plan, a simple website with a subscription-based
payment option would be easy to set up, would cost very little, and we would
only need to create an area within each user's profile for you to notify us of
your preferences. However, this isn’t the goal. We want a website where you
will lose yourself in a world of books and be able to explore books just like
getting lost in a library. Any “extra” money after books and packaging will
essentially be allocated into our website with the intention of achieving our
dream website sooner than later.
STORAGE: We live in
New York City, so we do not possess the space necessary to store a handful of
books in our apartments, let alone thousands of books. Initially, we will be
renting a storage unit to act as our warehouse, where all of our books and
packaging will be neatly organized. While we are first starting out, this will
cost us up to $50/month. We will also need a PO Box to initially gather all
return shipments. As we expand our collection, we will require more space,
which means we will need a larger, more expensive storage unit. Depending on how many
people use this service initially, we might just need a large office space that
doubles as a library right from the start. This will cost anywhere from $50 to
$3,000 per month.
MORE BOOKS: If we
are somehow able to exceed our $50,000 goal, are able to allocate extra funds
to areas that may require more (such as packaging and storage) accordingly, and
still manage to have an excess, all of that money will be invested into more
books! This will allow us to have a wider selection and we would then be able
expedite the release our “Chosen Plan” sooner than planned (pending the
completion of our website).
How we will use the funds if we don't reach our goal:
We are adamant about launching Curious Codex and we will do
everything we can to make it happen, even if we don’t reach our goal. Our goal
is to use Indiegogo as a means of skipping a few steps, and as a result,
allowing up to create our dream website, permitting us to obtain thousands of
books from the get-go, and to launch a detailed library database; however, if
we do not manage to raise our goal amount of $50,000, we have other
alternatives in mind that will allow us to still launch this service, but will
require more time to forge ahead and provide every possible service we hope to
make available to our customers.Services we will be providing at launch:
Our rental service will be divided into two plans: “Curated”
and “Chosen.” The “Curated Plan” will be the only plan available at launch. For
the “Curated Plan,” a book will be selected by Curious Codex in regards to the
preferences set by the customer. This plan allows Curious Codex to cut the
costs of the subscription, as the books chosen will essentially be free of any
“demand.” If, for example, 20 people were to want the same book but only 5
copies are available, in most instances this would drive up the price of the item. However, this is a scenario that will never occur under the “Curated Plan,”
as there are several good books to choose from, therefore the books are
unaffected by inflation caused by demand and scarcity. This also gives Curious
Codex the opportunity to introduce a customer to a book or author that they
would not have otherwise come across. We just ask you be a little bit curious!
Since this plan allows us to provide books free of demand,
we are subsequently able to offer it at a lower cost, and unlike other curated
services, we are choosing to not charge a premium. We have not
yet finalized our pricing, but we expect the “1 book at a time” and “2 books at
a time” plans to BOTH be under $10 per month. We are also positive our “3 books
at a time” plan will be under $15, and our “5 books at a time” plan will fall
between just under $15 to under $20 per month.
Our prices for these subscription plans will be finalized
once we have finished calculating the price of packaging and shipping per book,
but we only expect there to be a dollar or two in fluctuation, if at all. ALL
SHIPPING WILL BE FREE!
Services we want to provide in the near future:
The
Chosen Plan: This is our long-term goal for Curious
Codex. We will not be able to make this service available at launch due to the
cost necessary in creating a wide-enough and appealing collection of books. We
will be working diligently from the beginning to create an extensive online
library to allow this service to become available as quickly as possible.
We will also be taking suggestions from customers as to what books to include
in Curious Codex’s library, in addition to our list of favorites. Once we have
attained enough books and created a user-friendly website to release the
“Chosen Plan,” the service will function in a manner of a queue: customers will
be able to put together a list of books that they want, ranked in an order of priority,
and they will receive the books from Curious Codex in that order. The price for
this service will be more than that of the “Curated Plan” due to demand and
availability, as we will do everything possible to meet the demands of
subscribers regardless of availability, even if it means purchasing several
extra copies of a book. However, this service will only be $3-$5 more than the
“Curated Plan” – it will still be a smart and cost-efficient choice!
Monthly
Book Club: Curious Codex is also interested in
creating and launching a “Monthly Book Club.” Several Monthly Book Clubs
already exist, but we hope to create a book club more focused on cost and
excellent reading material than monthly experiences. Current book clubs focus
on specific genres and provide additional bookish items that go along with
their monthly theme; however, as great as an experience they are, there is a
premium involved. Don’t get us wrong, we love monthly themed book clubs, but
not everyone can afford it or are interested in the themed goodies. Our Book
Club will be less about the packaging and items, and more about getting a
fantastic read without having to pay for the extras. This book club will be
curated, meaning we will pick your monthly book based on your preferences, and
there will be an option for used, paperback, or hardcover books. Prices have
not yet been finalized, but we expect them to be just around market value for
paperback and hardcover, and far less for used books. We expect this service to
become available shortly after launch.

Our Mission:
Curious Codex’s mission is to provide an inclusive,
reasonably priced online book rental service that will allow subscribers to
access and explore books that we believe are exceptional, and that we truly believe
subscribers will enjoy. We hope to exceed expectations, to provide an
outstanding relationship between the company and its customers, to build a safe
and environmentally responsible culture, to be respectful at all times, and
most importantly, to display honesty and integrity in everything we do.
Ultimately, we hope to create a convenient and inexpensive service that will
motivate past readers to pick up and explore a book again.
Risks:
We are aware and fully understand the likelihood that we
will send you a book you don’t like or have already read. If you aren’t a fan
of the book we’ve sent you, we will be providing an outlet for you to let us
know! While we will be unable to accommodate you for not liking the book, that
information will allow us to better understand your preferences and increase the probability of finding a book you’ll truly love. If we’ve sent you a book
you’ve already read and have no interest in rereading it, send it back and shoot
us an email, and we’ll prorate your account the amount of days it took the
book to leave our facility and get back (meaning, if for example, there were 7
days of travel time between the book getting to your home and back, we will
give you 7 additional days of the service for free).
The “Curated Plan” is not a service made exclusively for the
adventurous reader – it is about opening yourself up to reading new and
different books. It doesn’t even have to be a completely different genre! Every
writer is different, and every dystopian or mystery novel has a different kind of
story that all fall under a different category. We will be picking books
based on your preferences, so if you only want to read steampunk, you will
definitely only be reading steampunk – though some might be based in London,
others in South Africa, or in a very distant post-apocalyptic future, unless
you’re specifically looking for it to just be based in Paris, then we will do
our best to find as many books that fit this criteria. Don’t have any
preferences whatsoever? Then expect to be dazzled by some of the greatest, most
obscure works out there! Just want to read some literary classics? We’ve got
you covered. Our “Curated Plan” is NOT a random book sent to
you – a lot of thought will be put into it!
We will not only encourage you to provide feedback, but we
will also do our best to make various outlets available to do so. We want
Curious Codex to be about the customers and meeting their needs in order to
offer a great experience. We not only understand how important a good book is,
but also how important a good service is – and we are hoping to meld these two
things. Curious Codex is a new kind of service, and we are hoping you will help
us nurture it to help it grow into an exceptional service. 
The Impact: Our goal with Curious Codex is to build a new type of
service that will make books more easily accessible without paying a premium.
However, we don’t believe we are taking business away from libraries or book
stores. Libraries offer several other services and will provide other books
that we will not, such as cookbooks and technical books, and libraries act as
local archives and safe spaces. We also do not believe we are taking business
away from book stores. We’re letting you rent a book, but you will have to
return it at some point. If you enjoyed reading the book we’ve sent you, our
service will not stop you from going out and buying that book from your local
bookstore. This service is merely an alternative for those who cannot afford to be
constantly buying books, some of which they may end up not liking, or don’t have
the time or easy access to a library. We’re merely providing a convenient
service for everyone who wishes to read but does not have the necessary time or
effort that goes into finding a new book.
We believe reading is integral to society. It is a means of
passing along knowledge and conveying a story that differs from our own. We
read to remember the past and to think up the future. Without books, cultures
and societies would not exist or be remembered. Books help shape who we are as
individuals, and introduce us to experiences we would have otherwise never
experienced. Books are important but are often priced as a luxury, and Curious
Codex is hoping to change this by providing an alternative to the traditional
model.
Other ways you can help:
Help
us spread the word! We know that not everyone can
donate money, but if you are interested in this service and would like to see
our work come into fruition, you can help us spread the word about our service
and our Indiegogo. We are planning on having a raffle where the winners will receive the entire Founder’s Bundle.
All you have to do is share our campaign on any social media platform with the
hashtag #curiouscodex and we will randomly
select and announce a few people (based on how much money we raise) as winners
at the end of the campaign. By helping us spread the word, you will be
assisting us in reaching our goal, and we want to show our appreciation in some
way.
Donate
your used books! Since we need so many books for
our rental service, we are contemplating accepting legible, used books. While
we currently cannot afford to pay for every used book, we would be more than
willing to pay for shipping. If you would like to discuss sending your used
books to us, please email us at inquiries@curiouscodex.com.
Contact
us! If you have any questions or concerns,
are interested in helping us with our website or packaging design, or would
like to discuss being an ongoing investor, please feel free to email us at inquiries@curiouscodex.com.
Who we are:
Kat Wood recently
graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in English and World Literatures. Recently
released from the confinement of college and brought into the world of debt,
she spends most of her free time buying books online. She currently lives in
upper Manhattan with her roommate and Astrid the cat. Kat is the proud owner of
300 books (and counting!), but she struggles to find places for them in her
tiny apartment.
She loves everything about books, from the smell of the
paper to the way the spine cracks when you open a fresh book. She loves getting
lost in a new world, and she loves being able to escape from reality for a
short period of time. Kat sees reading a book as a sort of vacation. She is
also a huge proponent of encouraging everyone to read. Everyone should be able to experience getting lost in a different reality. She believes that
reading can be entertaining and educational.Andy Cox is
a sometimes-reader, sometimes-writer with a fixation on narratives starring
complex and oppressed characters. A recent college graduate, he splits his time
between being a researcher for a marketing agency, working on a dozen
“projects” (many of which will never be realized), and cuddling with his cat,
le dauphin Prince Henri. He sometimes forgets his love of reading due to
bothersome e-books (they hurt his eyes after a half hour!), the lack of time or
energy to peruse a local or online bookstore, and the cost of said books. He
feels strongly about Curious Codex, not because it was his idea or because he
would totally use it if it existed in the way he is envisioning it, but because
he believes it will reignite the 21st century’s 20th century
love affair with the ancient use of the tome. He’s also known for really bad
metaphors.
Questions & Answers – send them to us!
Question: Why are the perks for your subscription listed at $30/$60 for 3/6 months? Does that mean it will be $10 per month?
Answer: We are asking for $10 per month for the perk for various reasons. The obvious reason is because we need as much money as possible to launch, and since our service is not yet in business, it will be a while before we are running efficiently. We also haven’t solidified our pricing, so we don’t want to charge too little and not have enough money to provide the service. The few extra dollars will essentially allow us to guarantee that this service will be launched. Once your 3 or 6 months of free service is over, you will be charged the cost of the subscription we have settled on, which will most likely be less than $10 per month. As a reward for donating the few extra dollars, people who purchase the $30 or $60 subscription perks are guaranteed access to Curious Codex at launch – so if an innumerable amount of people want to use our service, you will be assured first access.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>So, how much do we need and what for? Well, we're looking at raising up to £2,500 to support the release of the novel, by providing cash for marketing and advertising. After the cost of perks, we figure we'll have about £2,000 to spend on our goals for the book.</div>
<div>We are looking to do the following: </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">2</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">-3 adverts in popular online and print sci-fi and fantasy magazines around launch day and spread over the first 3 months of release.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Provide expenses for comicons and book launches. These expenses include booking tables, providing hard copies of books and POS advertising.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fund online ""booster"" advertising campaigns on Twitter, Goodreads and on Google Adwords.</span></li>
<li>Use the services of online book-centred PR companies who can get our press releases out to the national and international press.</li>
<li>Book marketing newsletters - Bookbub, Bookgorilla, The Fussy Librarian, amongst others.</li>
</ul>
<div>This will be our marketing campaign, and hopefully with a bit of work we will turn this into a bestseller. Now, even if we do not raise the full amount, we can certainly use a few of these options to great effect. Though, obviously we'd like to smash this target and do even more. </div>
</div>
<div>So, what do you get in return for pledging money to this campaign? Shinies. Shinies are what you get. These shinies (Indiegogo call them ""perks"" but we think ""shinies"" is a better name) include signed and inscribed copies of Conquest, ebooks, personal thanks from the author via email and postcard, posters, and a one-of-a-kind-everything-we-have-and-more shiny. Check the perks out and grab one for yourself. Virtual high-fives included in every perk, and your name will be listed as a sponsor on the Dagda Publishing website.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>What's the impact? Simple. We are a small publishing company with limited resources, we certainly don't have the massive marketing budgets of the huge publishing companies. This is why crowdfunding makes such a huge difference to us at this stage in our business model. The publishing world is a fast-evolving industry, and there are exciting times ahead. We are part of those times.</div>
<div>We also know that this works, as we previously ran a campaign last year for one of our previous novels, which ended up being over our target amount of £1,500. With your help we can do the same and better this time around.</div> <p>We believe in our authors, and that they are bringing something new and exciting to the world of fiction and literature. We hope you feel the same way and will consider investing in the future of these authors and their creations.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Of course, there are always risks involved. We feel that they are calculated risks, however. We have been doing this for 2 years now, constantly learning our trade as we go. We have published over a dozen books in that time, each of which has garnered a small amount of attention, but we feel it is time to step things up a bit. This is where you come in.

</div></div>","Short Summary Good day everyone, and thank you for stopping by and checking out our campaign. At Dagda Publishing we strive to bring you the best new writing talent, and it is to this end that we have started this campaign on Indiegogo. We are hoping to raise up to £2,500 for our upcoming novel ""Conquest: Book 1 of the Angels of Chicago series"" by UK author C.J. Somersby. Have a read of the synopsis below, and if this seems like the kind of book that would interest you as a reader, consider chucking a few quid towards the campaign!
Synopsis:
Samuel Black: Private Investigator. Misanthrope. Psychic. Blessed (or cursed, depending on your viewpoint) with the ""gift"" of second sight, Sam has found his talent to be a boon to his professional life, and a hindrance to his personal one. However, when a rogue angel named Alleam approaches him with a plan to stop the Apocalypse, all will be revealed about his past and his gift. Tasked with finding and stopping the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from riding out and enacting Armageddon, Sam will have to face off against demons, angels, bikers and all manner of Biblical terrors. In a literally apocalyptic showdown, what will become of our protagonist and the whole of Humanity?

<p><b>Q: </b>When’s it “drop,” etc.?<b><br/>A: </b>Issue No. 1, Spring 2015. Four-color, perfect-bound, 8 x 10 7/8
in., matte cover, ~100 pgs., printed in the U.S.A.<br/></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>Why should I care?<b><br/>A: </b>Because it’s the right people at the right time with the
right idea. The established, the fringe, the undersung and undiscovered—that's a heady cocktail, and they’ll
all be represented. And it's print, glorious print! Touch it, smell it, consume it, love it, stockpile it in the bathroom. This is what we live to do, and we've been doing it a long time. Learn more at <a href=""http://www.heckmagazine.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">heckmagazine.com</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Q: </b>Anything else?<b><br/>A: </b>Too many voices—wild, risky,
fearless, funny, weird—are not being heard. We want to be their megaphone.
And the audience is there. The evidence is everywhere. We all want powerful
storytelling, whether it be the truth in essays, nonfiction, and the like or
the kind of resonant, strange, surprising truth found in good fiction and
poetry. As more and more magazines abandon or cut back on fiction, we consider
it all the more crucial, an indispensable part of the story. Much fiction has been made milquetoast, much poetry
robbed of its power, much nonfiction bent to formulae. Too much of it hobbled in
some way. We’ll seek new voices and angles of pursuit to celebrate and
reveal the inexhaustible strength of our infinitely malleable and ever-changing
forms. There will always be some risk in the mix. <br/>¶ In general, we’ve got no
interest in the flavor of the nanosecond: we want to forgo timeliness,
celebrity, and politics as bloodsport. Instead, we want to go for timelessness and
art and the struggle—against ourselves, against the world, against injustice. But mostly we want to make a badass magazine you'll happily pay to appear in your mailbox every season, like frickin' magic, throbbing with delicious brain ooze. <br/>¶ 
Brilliant
takes on science and psychology and ethics rub shoulders with daring fiction
and confessionals and a dash of poetry! Documentary and conceptual photography and dynamic art and illustration dovetail
with wild humor and thrilling travel! Plus surprises.<br/>¶ Please donate and tweet and share and e-blast and skywrite and donate and purchase subscriptions for the needy if you want this creature to live. #heckisgo<br/>¶ Also: submissions are <a href=""http://www.heckmagazine.com/submit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">now open</a> for all kinds of stuff. There's a contest, too.<br/></p>

<b>&gt;&gt;</b> Support writers and artists you love—and those you've yet to discover—and keep print alive and thriving. Help us bring Heck to life. Join us in rejecting the myopia of the status quo and opening the door wider for the riskier work of the established and celebrated as well as the unknown awaiting discovery. <br/><br/><b>&gt;&gt; </b>Let's take the risks others retreat from, to
get bold voices old and new out there, to
slow things down more than a little bit, to
print no news, just truth.

<br/><br/><b>&gt;&gt;</b> We have the opportunity, the talent, the team to bring 
a new kind of mashup magazine into the world. We're doing it, but—cliché alert—we can’t do it
without you. Literally (not figuratively).<br/><br/><b>&gt;&gt;</b> Give what you can,
if you want. We've been working hard for more than a year
to create something worth your
time and, we
hope, a place on your shelf for centuries to come, since, apparently, we might all live to be like 350 years old.<br/><br/><b>&gt;&gt;</b> It's not advertisers but subscribers who give life and longevity to a print periodical. You, on that end, are both breath and bone, mind and voice. Subscribing and sharing are the most important things you can do—after throwing that all-important seed money at us, of course. If you don't want to throw it, you can also make it into paper airplanes. Hundreds work well.<br/><br/><b>$$$???:</b> Just so you know: it takes a helluva lot of time and hard work and people and money to get one of these babies airborne and self-sustaining. It has been one of those Herculean Efforts. That's why we're asking for your help to the tune of 25 grand, though 50 grand is more like it. We hope to exceed 50 so we can really focus on bringing you great work. Sick of the status quo and the Reign of Digital ""Content""? Join us. We are clearly crazy. Let's all be crazy together. Right here. Closer. We have stories to whisper into your ear...<br/>

Q: Who’s involved?A: See here. Our video was out of date looong ago. Heck is people, a work in progress growing in diversity and dimension, busy being born.¶ Contributing editors: Erika Wurth  | Wells Tower  | Jen Percy  |  Bob Shacochis  |  Dini Parayitam  |  Tom Bissell  |  Darcey Steinke  |  David Vann  |  Jamie Quatro  |  Evan Lavender-Smith  |  Rion Amilcar Scott  |  Jill Magid  |  Matthew Derby  |  Jack Handey  |  Janet Steen |  James Jung  |  Ngwah-Mbo Nana Nkweti  |  Patrick DeWitt  |  Robert Lopez  |  Laura van den Berg  |  Angus MacLachlan  |  Sonya Huber  |  William Wheeler  |  J.R.

Q: When’s it “drop,” etc.?A: Issue No. 1, Spring 2015. Four-color, perfect-bound, 8 x 10 7/8
in., matte cover, ~100 pgs., printed in the U.S.A.
Q: Why should I care?A: Because it’s the right people at the right time with the
right idea. The established, the fringe, the undersung and undiscovered—that's a heady cocktail, and they’ll
all be represented. And it's print, glorious print! Touch it, smell it, consume it, love it, stockpile it in the bathroom. This is what we live to do, and we've been doing it a long time. Learn more at heckmagazine.com.

Q: Anything else?A: Too many voices—wild, risky,
fearless, funny, weird—are not being heard. We want to be their megaphone.
And the audience is there. The evidence is everywhere. We all want powerful
storytelling, whether it be the truth in essays, nonfiction, and the like or
the kind of resonant, strange, surprising truth found in good fiction and
poetry. As more and more magazines abandon or cut back on fiction, we consider
it all the more crucial, an indispensable part of the story. Much fiction has been made milquetoast, much poetry
robbed of its power, much nonfiction bent to formulae. Too much of it hobbled in
some way. We’ll seek new voices and angles of pursuit to celebrate and
reveal the inexhaustible strength of our infinitely malleable and ever-changing
forms. There will always be some risk in the mix. ¶ In general, we’ve got no
interest in the flavor of the nanosecond: we want to forgo timeliness,
celebrity, and politics as bloodsport. Instead, we want to go for timelessness and
art and the struggle—against ourselves, against the world, against injustice. But mostly we want to make a badass magazine you'll happily pay to appear in your mailbox every season, like frickin' magic, throbbing with delicious brain ooze. ¶ 
Brilliant
takes on science and psychology and ethics rub shoulders with daring fiction
and confessionals and a dash of poetry! Documentary and conceptual photography and dynamic art and illustration dovetail
with wild humor and thrilling travel! Plus surprises.¶ Please donate and tweet and share and e-blast and skywrite and donate and purchase subscriptions for the needy if you want this creature to live. #heckisgo¶ Also: submissions are now open for all kinds of stuff. There's a contest, too.

Throw (or gently toss) money at us!

ISSUE NO. 1*¶ Fiction by Kali Fajardo-Anstine, Will Boast, Matthew Derby, Ernst Haffner [R.I.P.], Evan Lavender-Smith, D.T. Max, Bob Shacochis, George Singleton, David Vann...¶ Photographs from the Forbidden Zone by Joshua Paul¶ Poesy by Ansel Elkins & Clovis Hawkins¶ Essays, confessionals, humor, meta-investigations, reporting, creative nonfiction, reality experiments, etc. by Nancy Lemann, Jill Magid, Frank Bill, Chris Dixon, John Domini, Martha Anne Toll, Amelie Welden, J.R. Helton, Rowan Jacobsen, Adam Phillips, Rob Rhee, Mike Sager...
*NOTE: Some of this might change, but you get the idea. We're currently closing the issue and making final decisions. It's all very emotional.
ISSUES NOs. 2, 3 & 4: In the works as you read this. So much good stuff. But we're looking for more. LETTERPRESS LIMITED EDITIONS: Certain Heckwork will be published as gorgeous, author-signed letterpress limited editions.
BOOKS: We'd love to dip into indie publishing, too, a toe at a time. It's the [possibly nonexistent] future.
PROPAGANDA [PERKS]: Check it out here.

You! Yes, you!

>> Support writers and artists you love—and those you've yet to discover—and keep print alive and thriving. Help us bring Heck to life. Join us in rejecting the myopia of the status quo and opening the door wider for the riskier work of the established and celebrated as well as the unknown awaiting discovery. >> Let's take the risks others retreat from, to
get bold voices old and new out there, to
slow things down more than a little bit, to
print no news, just truth.

>> We have the opportunity, the talent, the team to bring 
a new kind of mashup magazine into the world. We're doing it, but—cliché alert—we can’t do it
without you. Literally (not figuratively).>> Give what you can,
if you want. We've been working hard for more than a year
to create something worth your
time and, we
hope, a place on your shelf for centuries to come, since, apparently, we might all live to be like 350 years old.>> It's not advertisers but subscribers who give life and longevity to a print periodical. You, on that end, are both breath and bone, mind and voice. Subscribing and sharing are the most important things you can do—after throwing that all-important seed money at us, of course. If you don't want to throw it, you can also make it into paper airplanes. Hundreds work well.$$$???: Just so you know: it takes a helluva lot of time and hard work and people and money to get one of these babies airborne and self-sustaining. It has been one of those Herculean Efforts. That's why we're asking for your help to the tune of 25 grand, though 50 grand is more like it. We hope to exceed 50 so we can really focus on bringing you great work. Sick of the status quo and the Reign of Digital ""Content""? Join us. We are clearly crazy. Let's all be crazy together. Right here. Closer. We have stories to whisper into your ear...

<h3>What I Need: <br/>

<h3>Why I Need Your Help:<br/>
</h3>Editing and book covers are expensive! Luckily, I got the editing 
down but can't afford to pay the graphic designer. As you know, a book cover is worth a 
thousand words. It's the first image a reader looks at when deciding if 
they should read the book or not. I'm aware of services like Fiverr 
where I can pay $5 for a cheap cover design, but I want to be taken 
seriously. Therefore, I will feel more confident working with a 
professional graphic designer. The one I picked understands my passion, 
my vision, and can bring my story to life through a cover.<br/><br/><h3>What You Get &amp; Your Impact:</h3> What you get:<br/><ul>
<li>You can choose from a virtual thank you, your name on my book's dedication page and/or a copy of my book in e-book format. <br/>
</li>
<li>Since it is erotica, please be 18+ years or older if you choose the e-book perk. Thanks for understanding.</li>
<li>If you're not into interracial erotica, no worries! I have many other books to publish! I can send you something different once those get publish. :)<br/>
</li>
</ul>With your help, I'll be able to get a professionally designed book cover and finish the process of self-publishing my novel. Only with your generosity, I can <i>finally  </i>launch my author career. You don't realize how much gratitude I have for caring people who are willing to give a chance for a struggling author. I hope to be able to pay it forward and help other new authors with their expenses one day. <br/><br/><b>I truly appreciate your support to anyone that's reading this, and I hope you have a wonderful day!</b><br/>

Since it is erotica, please be 18+ years or older if you choose the e-book perk. Thanks for understanding.
If you're not into interracial erotica, no worries! I have many other books to publish! I can send you something different once those get publish. :)

With your help, I'll be able to get a professionally designed book cover and finish the process of self-publishing my novel. Only with your generosity, I can finally  launch my author career. You don't realize how much gratitude I have for caring people who are willing to give a chance for a struggling author. I hope to be able to pay it forward and help other new authors with their expenses one day. I truly appreciate your support to anyone that's reading this, and I hope you have a wonderful day!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>Discover a ‘new’
classic from the legendary master of adventure!</b></p>Hi, we're the team at Eagle Books, the new imprint of Christmas Press, and we're thrilled to be bringing back to English-speaking readers one of the best adventure novels of all time, written by one of the most popular writers of all time: Jules Verne's <i>Mikhail Strogoff</i>.<p>First published in French
in 1876 as <i>Michel Strogoff,</i> it is a
rip-roaring tale of adventure and suspense, painted with romance and
humour and set in pre-revolutionary Russia. Suitable for both adult and young readers from 11 and up, it is a book that's inspired countless film and TV adaptations all over the world.</p><p>In France, it's never been out of print, with most people considering it to be Verne’s best novel, but it has dropped out of sight in English-speaking countries as the original English translation--published well over a century ago!--is rather stodgy and dated for modern tastes.</p>
<p>
But in Stephanie Smee's perfectly-pitched, lively translation of the original 1876 French text, the first such translation in over a hundred years, English-speaking readers can discover for themselves just why this novel has such an enormous following not only in France but all over the world. <br/></p>
<p>
Stephanie is a Sydney-based translator who turned in a legal career
to combine her true loves of literature and French. She is
responsible for introducing the enormously successful works of
much-loved French author, the Countess de Ségur, to a whole new
generation of English-speaking children, and her translations of these have been bestsellers.</p> We are thrilled that Stephanie's translation of Jules Verne's <i>Mikhail Strogoff</i> will be the launch title for Eagle Books in 2016 and to mark and celebrate this major publishing event, we are looking for your support to help fund the production of a beautiful limited edition of the novel, released in early 2016, well before general commercial publication. <br/><br/>This exclusive collectible edition will be limited to 750 hand-numbered copies, with internal pages of soft cream paper, and each chapter featuring a delicate black and white illustration by artist David Allan. The cover will feature a full colour illustration by David Allan, set into high-quality textured red hardback binding, and the book will feature other special elements, such as coloured end-papers, a satin bookmark, and gold foil detail on front, spine and on book block edges. <br/>This beautiful book will be available to Australian and New Zealand contributors for a pledge of AUD $55, postage included, and to all other international supporters for AUD $75, postage included. There are also many other levels of support, from $10 to $1000, and some truly fantastic perks for contributors, from commemorative bookmarks to playing cards, limited edition prints of the illustrations, authentic 19th century prints featuring Russian scenes, and more.

we’ve supported local authors by organizing outside-the-box events throughout

create a new fan base for writers.</p>
<p>We eschew the
notion of typical, “stuffy” readings and seek to engage individuals who wouldn’t

and academics. Basically, we make literature fun and accessible. In fact, our
proudest moments are when someone attends an event because it’s interesting,
and has no idea they’re at an event considered to be “literary.” Also, we always
make sure alcohol is available. That probably helps.</p>
<p>Over the
past several years, our calendar has included: storytelling and prose open
mics; literary pub crawls; our Critical
Drinking book group; Florida Bookstore Day; the Tampa Bay Book Fair; a Banned
Books Burlesque Show; Broad Comedy, a celebration of funny women writers;
Teenage Wasteland, established authors reading from their teen diaries, letters

<p>
</p>
<p>When no one else cared…They had each other.

</p>
<p><i>The past is a strange and beautiful thing. Some people run from it,
some try to relive it, some try to recreate it and some try to pretend that it
didn’t exist… yet the path builds and defines us all. For Alan, the past is a
living, breathing thing that has chased him from the streets of Summerfield to
present day, where it drags him back to his roots for a funeral that never
should have had to happen.</i></p>
<p><i>Fifteen years ago, Alan was just a kid taking care of himself – and all
those around him. The neighborhood kids looked up to him and relied on him,
partly because they had no one else, and partly because he seemed to have a
knack for the downtrodden. Fast forward and Alan feels the warm summer breeze
against his skin and hears voices he hasn’t heard in a long, long time.
Summerfield welcomes him like an old friend – a friend with history, knowledge
and secrets that could change everything for Alan. </i></p>
<h3>After The Long Wait...</h3> <p>Hello. Most of you who already know me, need no introduction. I am Albert J. Allie, a writer/director and all around filmmaker. So what am I campaigning?</p>
<p>     Finally after much pressure from friends, I have decided to write a book. But not just any book. I decided that I would write a book to talk about things that I have never told most people.

</div></div>","Summary


When no one else cared…They had each other.


The past is a strange and beautiful thing. Some people run from it,
some try to relive it, some try to recreate it and some try to pretend that it
didn’t exist… yet the path builds and defines us all. For Alan, the past is a
living, breathing thing that has chased him from the streets of Summerfield to
present day, where it drags him back to his roots for a funeral that never
should have had to happen.
Fifteen years ago, Alan was just a kid taking care of himself – and all
those around him. The neighborhood kids looked up to him and relied on him,
partly because they had no one else, and partly because he seemed to have a
knack for the downtrodden. Fast forward and Alan feels the warm summer breeze
against his skin and hears voices he hasn’t heard in a long, long time.
Summerfield welcomes him like an old friend – a friend with history, knowledge
and secrets that could change everything for Alan. 
After The Long Wait... Hello. Most of you who already know me, need no introduction. I am Albert J. Allie, a writer/director and all around filmmaker. So what am I campaigning?
     Finally after much pressure from friends, I have decided to write a book. But not just any book. I decided that I would write a book to talk about things that I have never told most people. Although I have fictionalized a portion of the story 97% of this book is based on actual events that have taken place in my life. I have changed names and certain facts to protect other people's privacy. 
     I have always been someone who has believed that our past molds and shapes us into who we become. It's just a matter of how resilient we are. How much we can take without breaking. My story, though a lot of it sad, has molded me into the boyfriend, husband, parent, grandparent and all around person I have become. What got me through my tough times are my friends. And this story is about just that. Friendships. four friends who need each other, when their own families do not even care. I have always thought this story should be told, but needed a way to tell it without compromising other people. And here it is. Inspired by my life, as well as those whom I credit as being the best group of friends I have ever had.      Set in the early 1980's, these four 13 to 14 yr old friends see each other through rape, drug abuse, bullying (and that's just from their own families).

</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">This campaign is important to me because it will allow for all curly girls and children in general to love themselves, and appreciate the uniqueness and differences of each person in this world. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">Someone said to me the other day, ""I can't wait to read your book to my daughter.

Tatiana goes around town saving lives and aiding others using her hair. From saving the life of the neighborhood kitty; to saving the lives of carnival goers at a local amusement park, Tatiana learns the importance of helping others.  The inspiration for my book, <i>The Girl With The Magic Curls </i>came from my daughter Tatiana. As a multiracial family and coming from a diverse background, I thought it would be a good idea to have a child super hero with a unique special power. In love with my daughter’s curly hair and my curly hair, I thought why not create a character with curly hair that has amazing super power abilities using her hair? The messages in this story are relatable, loving your hair, girl empowerment, and being of service to all humankind. </span>

</div>
</div><div>
<p>Since deciding to self-publish their are some rather pricey fees involved. Below is the breakdown and description of why $5,000 is my target fundraising goal. </p> <ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Copyeditor/Developmental Edits-$200, making sure my book is grammar free, sentence structure is on point as well as reading appropriate for my target age group. I want my book to be a professional piece of art before it goes to print. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Illustrator - $3,000, There are so many great illustrators out there who do awesome work! Their efforts should most definitely be rewarded from character development to creating the book cover page to the rest of the illustrations it's only fair to reward them for their hard work. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Book layout and formatting and printing -$1,000, I'm using a platform called CreateSpace through Amazon to layout, format and print my book. Amazon is a great platform that can provide many copies of your book for a great price, especially printing on demand. This is a great and easy platform, I've seen many books printed using their services. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">ISBN – 5 for $100</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span>Website Design - $700, I would love to hire a website designer using my paid domain name MyMagicalCurls.com. This website would include information about myself and my book. My book would be available for purchase on this site as well as any memorabilia that comes along with it such as: t-shirts, socks, bookmarks and stickers. </span></li>

This campaign is important to me because it will allow for all curly girls and children in general to love themselves, and appreciate the uniqueness and differences of each person in this world. Someone said to me the other day, ""I can't wait to read your book to my daughter. We need more curly girls as super heroes, to look up to."" I was humbled by the statement as it made me feel that I am making a difference in the lives of curly girls and girls around the world.

The Girl With The Magical Curls is about a little girl named Tatiana who develops magical hair powers while it gets caught in her neighbor’s ivies. Tatiana goes around town saving lives and aiding others using her hair. From saving the life of the neighborhood kitty; to saving the lives of carnival goers at a local amusement park, Tatiana learns the importance of helping others.  The inspiration for my book, The Girl With The Magic Curls came from my daughter Tatiana. As a multiracial family and coming from a diverse background, I thought it would be a good idea to have a child super hero with a unique special power. In love with my daughter’s curly hair and my curly hair, I thought why not create a character with curly hair that has amazing super power abilities using her hair? The messages in this story are relatable, loving your hair, girl empowerment, and being of service to all humankind. 




What We Need 


Since deciding to self-publish their are some rather pricey fees involved. Below is the breakdown and description of why $5,000 is my target fundraising goal.  
Copyeditor/Developmental Edits-$200, making sure my book is grammar free, sentence structure is on point as well as reading appropriate for my target age group. I want my book to be a professional piece of art before it goes to print. 

Illustrator - $3,000, There are so many great illustrators out there who do awesome work! Their efforts should most definitely be rewarded from character development to creating the book cover page to the rest of the illustrations it's only fair to reward them for their hard work. 


Book layout and formatting and printing -$1,000, I'm using a platform called CreateSpace through Amazon to layout, format and print my book. Amazon is a great platform that can provide many copies of your book for a great price, especially printing on demand. This is a great and easy platform, I've seen many books printed using their services. 


ISBN – 5 for $100

Website Design - $700, I would love to hire a website designer using my paid domain name MyMagicalCurls.com. This website would include information about myself and my book. My book would be available for purchase on this site as well as any memorabilia that comes along with it such as: t-shirts, socks, bookmarks and stickers.

<h2>VISTA HERMOSA<br/>DESDE SUS OJOS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Al menos 362 personas han sido afectadas desde 1990 por minas antipersona en el municipio de Vista Hermosa, Meta, convirtiéndolo en el lugar con el mayor número de víctimas por este artefacto en Colombia.</p>
</div><p>Pese al temor que acompañó a Vista Hermosa durante décadas, ahora sus habitantes quieren contar la historia desde sus ojos y compartir su memoria como un método de superación para las futuras generaciones. ¿Y a usted también le gustaría escucharlas?</p><p>Con el proyecto Vista Hermosa desde sus ojos, Rutas del Conflicto quiere crear un puente entre las historias de los pobladores de Vista Hermosa y el resto del mundo. Como parte del proyecto, buscamos empoderar a los jóvenes del municipio para que narren los hechos, vivencias y anécdotas sin intermediarios y puedan difundir la información en una plataforma periodística.</p><p>La imagen de Vista Hermosa se construyó como la de un lugar violento y peligroso. Este ha sido un municipio donde el tira y afloje de diferentes actores armados ha puesto en peligro la vida de sus habitantes. La disputa entre paramilitares de las Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC), las Autodefensas Campesinas de Casanare, guerrilleros de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), y miembros de la fuerza pública provocó desapariciones, muertes y el desplazamiento de cientos de vistahermoseños.</p><p>Las minas antipersona han dejado huellas físicas visibles, pero también otras que invisibles han quedado en la memoria de sus pobladores. Estas historias, al igual que muchas minas, permanecen enterradas en el olvido.</p><p>Queremos que hagas parte de este intento por acercar las historias de los sobrevivientes a aquellos con distintas miradas del conflicto para promover un diálogo de paz.</p><p><i>""El rol de las historias que queremos contar, no es para quejarnos o recordar dolorosamente. Más bien, vamos a demostrar la superación que hemos tenido a través del tiempo, sin pensar en las barreras que nos han impuesto la guerra o la violencia, sufrida por algunos jóvenes aquí en el municipio""</i>: David Ballén, líder Grupo Unión de Pensamiento Joven. </p><p> </p><h3> ¿Por qué donar? El proyecto en 5 razones</h3><ol>
<li>Vista Hermosa es el municipio con más víctimas de minas antipersona en Colombia. Este proyecto brindará información sobre las afectaciones causadas por los artefactos y la manera cómo la población ha logrado sobreponerse a las secuelas.</li>
<li>Para algunos vistahermoseños, hablar sobre el tema de minas es una manera de “quitar la amargura”, construir memoria, y sobretodo, evitar que muchas situaciones queden impunes.</li>
<li>Queremos darle otra mirada al conflicto que ha sufrido en Vista Hermosa, desde el punto de vista de quienes han sufrido la guerra durante 30 años, sin revictimizar.</li>
<li>Buscamos unir las historias con un espacio para contarlas. Son pocos los jóvenes que tienen acceso a recursos de narración audiovisual, y sin embargo, buscan por iniciativa propia herramientas para comunicar los sucesos de Vista Hermosa de la mejor forma posible. Rutas del Conflicto busca compartir las técnicas periodísticas con municipios afectados. ¡Hagamos ese puente!</li>
<li>Por último, la reconstrucción de la memoria de los vistahermoseños será un insumo valioso tanto para investigadores del tema y cualquiera que quiera entender la realidad colombiana. Además, este será un nuevo paso en el proceso de construcción de paz en la región.</li>
</ol><p> </p><h2>¿Cómo será la plataforma?</h2><p>El portal periodístico que queremos construir con su apoyo será un lugar de retroalimentación contínua, donde se muestre información sobre el conflicto de Vista Hermosa, el impacto de las minas antipersona y cómo sus habitantes se han empoderado para sobreponerse a las consecuencias de la guerra. A través de las vivencias de sus habitantes, crearemos un espacio para visibilizar la manera cómo han reconstruido sus vidas.</p><p>Hechos que permitan hacer una reconstrucción del conflicto en el lugar, incluyendo testimonios de sobrevivientes de manera escrita o audiovisual y cifras relacionadas con el desplazamiento, el proceso de desminado, asesinatos y finalmente sobre el posible panorama de posconflicto en el municipio.</p><p>La participación de la comunidad es la parte fundamental del proyecto. Queremos capacitar a jóvenes y adultos para que adquieran herramientas periodísticas básicas que les permitan escribir crónicas, perfiles y reportajes que sean publicados en el portal.​</p><p><i>""Yo digo sí, nosotros somos normales. Quien nos pone límites a una discapacidad es la persona que nos observa""</i>: Luz Dary Pineda, líder y sobreviviente de minas antipersona.<br/> </p><h3>Más sobre Rutas del Conflicto</h3><p>¿Quién sabe de la guerra en Colombia? ¿Los ciudadanos, la justicia, los medios de comunicación o los grupos armados? La realidad es que la información está dispersa y es inexacta. Por eso creamos Rutas del Conflicto, un medio de comunicación que reúne información del conflicto armado en Colombia, a partir de una extensa base de datos periodística y contenido narrativo y de investigación.</p><p>Nuestra plataforma permite visualizar los datos a través de mapas y líneas de tiempo que explican el contexto histórico y geográfico de la guerra; especiales periodísticos con la reconstrucción histórica del conflicto armado en distintas regiones de Colombia  y testimonios de sobrevivientes a la guerra.</p><p>Rutas del Conflicto surgió de la necesidad de visibilizar los hechos del conflicto armado colombiano que no habían sido narrados ni resaltados por los medios de comunicación y el mismo Estado, convirtiéndose en la primera base de datos periodística que ha documentando 728 masacres perpetradas entre 1982 hasta la fecha.  </p><p>En 2015, creamos el proyecto <i>Yo Sobreviví</i>, un ejercicio de periodismo transmedia donde involucramos a las comunidades no solo como fuentes de información sino también en la producción y verificación de contenidos.</p><p>Somos un proyecto que busca ser una fuente de consulta para centros de enseñanza, investigadores, medios de comunicación, organizaciones de víctimas y ciudadanos del común.</p><p>¿Tienes preguntas? Contáctanos al correo <strong>rutasdelconflicto@gmail.com</strong> y estaremos pendientes de contestarte.</p><p> </p><h3>¿Cómo más puedes ayudar?</h3><p>Si no puedes donar, ayúdanos con tu red de contactos para contarle al mundo de nuestra campaña y de lo que queremos hacer por nuestro país.

It makes it the place with the highest number of victims caused by landmines in Colombia.   </p><p>Despite the fear that has lived in Vista Hermosa for decades, nowadays its inhabitants want to tell and reveal the story from their own eyes and share their memories. As described by David Ballén, a regional youth leader, it would be “an overcoming method for future generations”. And how about you? Would you like to listen to those stories?</p><p>With the project <strong>Vista Hermosa from its eyes</strong>, the Colombian journalistic media Rutas del Conflicto wants to create a bridge between the stories from the people of Vista Hermosa and those who want to know it. As an important part of this project, we work for the empowerment of the municipality’s youth, in order to help them narrate facts, experiences and anecdotes without intermediaries and distribute all this information through a journalistic online platform.</p><p>People perceive Vista Hermosa as a dangerous and violent place. The action by several armed actors has affected the municipality and endangered its inhabitants. The conflict, which included the presence of paramilitaries, as Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia and Autodefensas Campesinas de Casanare, the FARC insurgent group (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia), and Colombian legal armed forces caused disappearances, deaths and displacement of hundreds of Vista Hermosa’s inhabitants.</p><p>The explosions have left not only physical and visible traces, but also other marks, psychological ones, which have remained invisible in the memory of survivors. These stories, like many landmines, are still buried in people’s lack of awareness.       </p><p>We want you to be part of this project, in an attempt to bring the survivors’ stories closer to those with different views of Colombian conflict and to promote a peace dialogue.</p><p><i>“The role of stories that we want to tell, it’s” not to complain or remember it painfully. Moreover, we will show the overcoming we have had through time, without thinking in the obstacles imposed by war or violence, suffered by some young people from the municipality”</i>: David Ballén, a youth organization’s leader.</p><p> </p><h3>Why donate? 5 reasons why you should donate</h3><ol>

It makes it the place with the highest number of victims caused by landmines in Colombia.   Despite the fear that has lived in Vista Hermosa for decades, nowadays its inhabitants want to tell and reveal the story from their own eyes and share their memories. As described by David Ballén, a regional youth leader, it would be “an overcoming method for future generations”. And how about you? Would you like to listen to those stories?With the project Vista Hermosa from its eyes, the Colombian journalistic media Rutas del Conflicto wants to create a bridge between the stories from the people of Vista Hermosa and those who want to know it. As an important part of this project, we work for the empowerment of the municipality’s youth, in order to help them narrate facts, experiences and anecdotes without intermediaries and distribute all this information through a journalistic online platform.People perceive Vista Hermosa as a dangerous and violent place. The action by several armed actors has affected the municipality and endangered its inhabitants. The conflict, which included the presence of paramilitaries, as Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia and Autodefensas Campesinas de Casanare, the FARC insurgent group (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia), and Colombian legal armed forces caused disappearances, deaths and displacement of hundreds of Vista Hermosa’s inhabitants.The explosions have left not only physical and visible traces, but also other marks, psychological ones, which have remained invisible in the memory of survivors. These stories, like many landmines, are still buried in people’s lack of awareness.       We want you to be part of this project, in an attempt to bring the survivors’ stories closer to those with different views of Colombian conflict and to promote a peace dialogue.“The role of stories that we want to tell, it’s” not to complain or remember it painfully. Moreover, we will show the overcoming we have had through time, without thinking in the obstacles imposed by war or violence, suffered by some young people from the municipality”: David Ballén, a youth organization’s leader. Why donate? 5 reasons why you should donate

<h3>It has taken me ten years to write down my story. Now I am raising funds for financial support in translating it into English. ""An Unlikely Rebellion"" is my true story.</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Franciska von Koch and I was born and raised in Sweden. When I was seventeen I hitchhiked all the way through Europe to Pakistan, where I fell madly in love with a young handsome man from the Pashtun people. </p>
<p>""<i>Shahid was the son of a wealthy landowner – and was already engaged when he fell head over heels for Magdalena. In his honor-bound culture, their whirlwind romance and impromptu marriage were an affront to his fiancée’s family, a crime worthy of death."" </i></p>
<p>""Franciska von Koch paints a moving portrait of her alter ego Magdalena’s trials in the Swat Valley of northern Pakistan, the beauty of the countryside, the love of her husband and his welcoming family and the eventual collapse of their dream. Brought up in the heady laissez-faire world of the 1960s free-love era, 17-year-old Magdalena was a spiritual seeker, easily influenced by those who inspired her. Following on the coattails of the Beatles, she and a friend hitchhiked from Stockholm in 1971 in search of a guru to teach them. The goal was India, but Magdalena never got that far. In the borderlands of Northern Pakistan, she fell madly in love with a young Pashtun man, a turn of events that took both of their lives onto a whole new path...""</p>

<p><strong>In the book </strong>you will find authentic letters and photographs and get insight into what a life could look like behind the walls of a conservative Muslim family, a life where women live secluded from the world. Its not a black and white story, but rather a heartfelt description of a family in an old fashioned Patriarchal system and how difficult it is to fall in love outside your own culture.</p>

<p><strong>I feel an urgency </strong>in that as many people as possible can get to read my story. Our world today needs more understanding and perspective to know how cultural differences hinders the flow of the open heart. If I can have it translated into English, many more people can get to read it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need 4500 USD in order for having it translated into English by a professional. In addition 500 USD will cover the expenses for the crowdfunding and the publishing of the book digitally. I will be able to present it to several international Publishers and hopefully get it published. If less funds come in I intend to find other means, maybe a loan to cover whats missing. I do intend to make this happen. </p>
<p><strong>You will get </strong>a digital copy of the book sent to you as soon as it is translated. In addition I have some gifts in mind that I like to post to you if you give me your adress.</p>
<p><strong>This story</strong> has not ben told before, its unique, its true and its important, because the world we live in today is meeting many challenges concerning the confrontations of Western and Eastern cultures.</p>
</div><div><p><strong>You will contribute </strong>to a greater understanding of whats happening in the world today. We live in a time when many people from honour-bound cultures and Patriarchal societies move to the Western world. Clashes are inevitable and we need greater understanding from both sides.</p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

Now I am raising funds for financial support in translating it into English. ""An Unlikely Rebellion"" is my true story.
Hi, my name is Franciska von Koch and I was born and raised in Sweden. When I was seventeen I hitchhiked all the way through Europe to Pakistan, where I fell madly in love with a young handsome man from the Pashtun people. 
""Shahid was the son of a wealthy landowner – and was already engaged when he fell head over heels for Magdalena. In his honor-bound culture, their whirlwind romance and impromptu marriage were an affront to his fiancée’s family, a crime worthy of death."" 
""Franciska von Koch paints a moving portrait of her alter ego Magdalena’s trials in the Swat Valley of northern Pakistan, the beauty of the countryside, the love of her husband and his welcoming family and the eventual collapse of their dream. Brought up in the heady laissez-faire world of the 1960s free-love era, 17-year-old Magdalena was a spiritual seeker, easily influenced by those who inspired her. Following on the coattails of the Beatles, she and a friend hitchhiked from Stockholm in 1971 in search of a guru to teach them. The goal was India, but Magdalena never got that far. In the borderlands of Northern Pakistan, she fell madly in love with a young Pashtun man, a turn of events that took both of their lives onto a whole new path...""

In the book you will find authentic letters and photographs and get insight into what a life could look like behind the walls of a conservative Muslim family, a life where women live secluded from the world. Its not a black and white story, but rather a heartfelt description of a family in an old fashioned Patriarchal system and how difficult it is to fall in love outside your own culture.
http://Read excerpts from the book: https://franciskavonkoch.com/an-unlikely-rebellion/
I feel an urgency in that as many people as possible can get to read my story. Our world today needs more understanding and perspective to know how cultural differences hinders the flow of the open heart. If I can have it translated into English, many more people can get to read it. 

What We Need & What You Get
I need 4500 USD in order for having it translated into English by a professional. In addition 500 USD will cover the expenses for the crowdfunding and the publishing of the book digitally. I will be able to present it to several international Publishers and hopefully get it published. If less funds come in I intend to find other means, maybe a loan to cover whats missing. I do intend to make this happen. 
You will get a digital copy of the book sent to you as soon as it is translated. In addition I have some gifts in mind that I like to post to you if you give me your adress.
This story has not ben told before, its unique, its true and its important, because the world we live in today is meeting many challenges concerning the confrontations of Western and Eastern cultures.
You will contribute to a greater understanding of whats happening in the world today. We live in a time when many people from honour-bound cultures and Patriarchal societies move to the Western world. Clashes are inevitable and we need greater understanding from both sides.

<i>Burning Alexandria</i> <i>by A.P. Runke<br/><br/></i><b>Tagline:</b><i> Alexandria burned. Salem burned. Dahlia will burn.<br/><br/></i><p><b>Excerpt:</b><i> A deep black smoke starts to fill the
 crystal ball and Dahlia wonders where Madame Gordenia hid the switch 
and how the smoke doesn’t stain the orb. Soon the crystal is filled, an 
opaque black and the surface is a weird matte, Dahlia cannot even see 
her reflection. Confused she looks away from it, blinks a few times in 
relief, before looking up to ask Madam Gordenia if that was supposed to 
happen. The words, however, die in her throat.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>  Upon
 making eye contact with Madame Gordenia Dahlia’s breath freezes in her 
chest. Madame Gordenia’s eyes are glazed over white. Dahlia cannot make 
out even her irises let alone her pupils. Still the eyes seem to be 
rolling in their sockets as if watching a tennis match in zero gravity. 
Dahlia gulps, finding her voice.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>  “Madame
 Gordenia?” It’s barely a squeak in the room. Madame Gordenia’s eyes stop
 roving and seem fixated on Dahlia’s face. Dahlia bangs her head on the 
back of her chair as she jumps in surprise. Madame Gordenia speaks. Her 
voice is low and grinds like tires on gravel.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>  “Alexandria burned.” She moans. She takes a deep breath.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>  “Salem burned!” It’s a shout and Dahlia is frozen in her seat. Madame Gordenia lifts her hand pointing at the crystal ball.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>  “Dahlia
 will burn.” It’s a whisper. Before Dahlia can say a thing her eyes are 
drawn to the ball. In the smoke a face appears, the smoke coloring their
 eyes and pouring from their mouth. Suddenly the small flickering 
candles burst forth in flames, reaching the cloth draped ceiling. Dahlia
 screams throwing her arms above her head. The face in the ball yells, 
the sentence echoing in the now burning room.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>  “Where
 is the book Hypatia!?” and with that the orb shatters, a piece 
scratching Madame Gordenia’s cheek and Dahlia ducks. Suddenly she can 
hear Abbi outside banging on the door. Screaming for her and Madame 
Gordenia. Madame Gordenia blinks, notices her room is on fire and leaps 
for a bucket of water hidden beneath a curtain immediately splashing it 
up onto the fire lit ceiling. Madame Gordenia grabs Dahlia’s arm, both 
her hands are ashen and trembling. Madame Gordenia heaves open the oak door 
throwing Dahlia out. Dahlia is unable to catch her feet, stumbles into 
Abbi’s body.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>  “G...get out.” Madame Gordenia’s voice is practically gone. It sounds as if she’s swallowed wasabi, speaking in wheezes and gasps. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>“Get out! You Demons! Get Out!!!” She

</div></div>","Burning Alexandria by A.P. RunkeTagline: Alexandria burned. Salem burned. Dahlia will burn.Excerpt: A deep black smoke starts to fill the
 crystal ball and Dahlia wonders where Madame Gordenia hid the switch 
and how the smoke doesn’t stain the orb. Soon the crystal is filled, an 
opaque black and the surface is a weird matte, Dahlia cannot even see 
her reflection. Confused she looks away from it, blinks a few times in 
relief, before looking up to ask Madam Gordenia if that was supposed to 
happen. The words, however, die in her throat.

  Upon
 making eye contact with Madame Gordenia Dahlia’s breath freezes in her 
chest. Madame Gordenia’s eyes are glazed over white. Dahlia cannot make 
out even her irises let alone her pupils. Still the eyes seem to be 
rolling in their sockets as if watching a tennis match in zero gravity. 
Dahlia gulps, finding her voice.

  “Madame
 Gordenia?” It’s barely a squeak in the room. Madame Gordenia’s eyes stop
 roving and seem fixated on Dahlia’s face. Dahlia bangs her head on the 
back of her chair as she jumps in surprise. Madame Gordenia speaks. Her 
voice is low and grinds like tires on gravel.

  “Alexandria burned.” She moans. She takes a deep breath.

  “Salem burned!” It’s a shout and Dahlia is frozen in her seat. Madame Gordenia lifts her hand pointing at the crystal ball.

  “Dahlia
 will burn.” It’s a whisper. Before Dahlia can say a thing her eyes are 
drawn to the ball. In the smoke a face appears, the smoke coloring their
 eyes and pouring from their mouth. Suddenly the small flickering 
candles burst forth in flames, reaching the cloth draped ceiling. Dahlia
 screams throwing her arms above her head. The face in the ball yells, 
the sentence echoing in the now burning room.

  “Where
 is the book Hypatia!?” and with that the orb shatters, a piece 
scratching Madame Gordenia’s cheek and Dahlia ducks. Suddenly she can 
hear Abbi outside banging on the door. Screaming for her and Madame 
Gordenia. Madame Gordenia blinks, notices her room is on fire and leaps 
for a bucket of water hidden beneath a curtain immediately splashing it 
up onto the fire lit ceiling. Madame Gordenia grabs Dahlia’s arm, both 
her hands are ashen and trembling. Madame Gordenia heaves open the oak door 
throwing Dahlia out. Dahlia is unable to catch her feet, stumbles into 
Abbi’s body.

  “G...get out.” Madame Gordenia’s voice is practically gone. It sounds as if she’s swallowed wasabi, speaking in wheezes and gasps. 

“Get out! You Demons! Get Out!!!” She 
screeches arms flailing and Abbi hauls Dahlia to her feet grabbing their
 bags and hauling the two of them out the door. They hear a resounding 
lock behind them then muffled sobs. Dahlia makes it off the porch before 
succumbing and falling to her knees.

  “Dahlia! Dahlia look at me! What happened? Are you okay? Was something on fire? Dahlia say something!”

  “Who is Hypatia?”

<p>In 2016, I lost the great love of my life. That was the genesis for this <strong>Back From the Dead</strong> book project. In the deep pain of this loss, as I tried to deal and heal, I started writing my story. Along the way, I met others who had also lost great loves and had suffered mightily, were still hurting. I told each of them about my project. I invited them to add their voices and make it <i>our</i> project by sharing their stories in the book as well. Most of them said ""Yes."" We all saw that sharing our own stories might bring us some healing <i>and </i>help others in the same boat. It was cathartic for all of us, but in the end, it was illuminating and healing.</p>
<p>It's our sincere hope that our stories will inspire, comfort, reassure, encourage and guide others going through similar troubles. We hope they'll even bring a few laughs, along with the tears. </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Okay, who am I, what's this project all about, why do we need help, and why should you care?</p>
<ul>
<li>David Nyro is the name, as in ""pen name."" (Todd, to my family and friends.) I am a father, brother, writer, musician, artist, and an incurable romantic who has made a career out of choosing the wrong partners. I'm also no box of chocolates myself. HA! My background is in broadcasting, marketing, music, nonprofit fundraising, and love.</li>
<li>What is <strong>Back From the Dead</strong>? It's a book, with stories from real folks, observations on life, ideas and solutions for relationships, being single, how no dog should ever be smaller than a squirrel, and re-imagining society. Oh, yeah. That. It's also a graphic novel in parts, with art by well-known British artist, Dylan Riley. This is a classic D.I.Y. (Do It Yourself) project.</li>
<li>The IndieGoGo <strong>Back From the Dead</strong> campaign seeks to raise $10,000 from lovely patron saints, like you, to pay our artist, Dylan, pay for a professional editor - absolutely essential for any author -  and help underwrite the book's production and marketing, and my efforts to bring this unique book to the marketplace.</li>
<li>Why feel, why care, why invest?<strong> If you've ever loved and lost, </strong>you have something very much in common with this book, the people in this book, and the very reason it was created. And the reason we're putting it out in the world: to help people, and to help society. Our dream and goal is to have a very real impact on people's lives, both in the moment and long-term. We passionately believe that our stories of love, loss, grief, anger, fear, recovery, redemption, grace, and more, will resonate with pretty much everyone, and, we hope, help them in a myriad of ways, from comforting them to inspiring them. Here are some of the topics, followed in parentheses by some of the chapter/section titles:</li>
<li>There's tested, real-world guidance on how to be a little wiser when it comes to choosing a partner (Red Flags, Red Herrings, and Red Questions, Our Roman Ways, Entrance Strategies, Fool Me Once, On the Spectrum, Golden Dancers) </li>
<li>
<i>Ground Truths</i> (True love has no past tense, What Love is Not, Ego=Perception=Reality, Gateway Love, The Bald Truth, Partner with a Parakeet, Rwanda and Forgiveness, Not So Great, Expectations, Timing, Luck, Genes, and Control, Just dropped in to see what condition my Unconditional was in, The Currency of Conditional Love)</li>
<li>Getting through a break-up (Zombie or Not Zombie, The Year of Crying Dangerously, When your ex-lover literally gives you curtains as a parting gift, The ""Throw People Away"" Years, Schwinn vs Millennium Falcon, The Stranger Beside You)</li>
<li>Being Single in a Couple Society (Atom Bomb vs Equal Rights, Married to Myself, 47, and counting, Benefits of Being Single, Alone doesn't mean Lonely, Liberated, Single Mindfulness)</li>
<li>A Love Supreme (We teach Fear, why not Love? Einstein Knew a Few Things, Change the World)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise $10,000 to bring this book to the world. Here's the breakdown:</li>
<li>$4,000 - $5,000 for the art</li>
<li>$2,000 - $3,000 for a professional editor</li>
<li>$4,000 - $5,000+ for website, book production, marketing, pr, book tour, etc.</li>
<li>We project this project, when all is said and done, will cost more than $10,000, but $10,000 gets us out the door, and down the road quite a ways. It might even be enough, but we also know that things invariably almost always cost more, and take longer, than one thinks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What You Get, if you invest:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$1,000, and up, you get a limited edition, numbered and hand-signed, original artwork of the cover by UK artist, Dylan Riley. (See Dylan's art, above.) You'll also get two special BFTD T-shirts, featuring Dylan's haunting zombiedacious art and a special quote from our book, like ""Love has no past tense."" You'll wear it proudly, true believer! A copy of our book, autographed by the author and the artist, and, unless you want to be anonymous, you'll be thanked, by name, in the book. Other special perks to be announced. Our eternal gratitude, of course!</li>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<ul><li>You absolutely WILL have an impact on this project. Your dollars (and word-of-mouth) WILL help get it to the marketplace. I can't promise a specific impact, or the breadth of the impact, on that marketplace. It will all depend on who reads it, and how many. (Oh, Oprah?) This book has the potential to make people feel better, lift their spirits, help them heal, ask better questions, make better choices and decisions about love, partners, work, career, life. It might literally change some lives, for the better. If the <strong>Love SupreME</strong> part takes root and grows wings, legs and fins, and becomes the reality I envision, we could literally change an entire generation, and future generations, when it comes to identity, consciousness, love, relationships, and our very society. Paradigm shift. Yes, this is tremendously bold and ambitious, but it's something that's actually possible. That's the Big Picture possibility. It's not world peace and curing cancer, but it might be as significant. And, who knows, maybe there'll be a movie! :-) </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the risks? The biggest risk is the book will never be finished. I might be hit by a beer truck. The love of my life might return and necessitate the shelving of this book. However, I have a greater chance of winning the lottery. As we all know, and as is touched on in my book, lovers rarely, if ever, return. But I mention in the interest of transparency. I might also be taken out by a meteorite. Another risk for me is that the book will do a big belly flop. It'll still be created, and your investment will have done its job, but we won't have the outcome we all hope for. My personal sales goal for the book is 5 million copies sold. I have that in writing on my giant post-it pad. Gotta dream BIG, right? </li>
<li>Challenges for me will be staying focused, disciplined, and in pursuit. Writing a book is a marathon. And finishing it is only half of that marathon, albeit the most important part. I work on the book every single day, seven days a week. I write at least an hour a day, and some days, up to five hours. A word of advice: never write a book! HA! But it's going to be great when it's all done! Other challenges: finding, and funding, a professional editor to edit the book. (Your support will make this possible.) Finding a literary agent (luckily, good, reputable literary agents do not charge writers; they are paid when they secure a publishing deal) to pitch the book to a publisher; finding a publisher, marketing the book, which will include finding, and funding, a good pr firm to help promote the book.  The good news is that I actually enjoy, even get a kick from, marketing, promotion, etc. I know, I'm weird that way. Most people like creating, but not marketing, or vice versa. So, this is an advantage for me, and for all of us. </li>
<li>FYI: I do have a business plan, which includes a marketing plan, for our book. I have created several business plans and marketing plans over the years, including my ten plus years as the prime fundraiser at the hunger relief nonprofit I worked at, Northwest Harvest. I also do all the marketing and promotion for my music career. Did the same for my band in the 90's. I have extensive experience in marketing, communications/media, public relations, promotions, events, writing, journalism, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>As I mention in our video, helping us spread the word is invaluable. Maybe you know Jeff Bezos? Hee hee. Sharing this opportunity with your friends, family, co-workers, in person or via social media, is incredibly valuable, desired, needed, appreciated, effective, etc. One never knows where it might lead, what it might trigger. </li>
<li>IndieGoGo has algorithms! That means, their little bots are watching all these IndieGoGo campaigns. Depending on how many folks come to my little zombie soiree, and/or donate, our campaign might end up being one of their featured campaigns. If that happens, then thousands of eyeballs will see it, and that could mean more dollars for our book!!! Many hands make light work, right?</li>

<p>'Watercolours in a Second' by Ian Macdonald-Smith</p>
<p>Ian has been a professional photographer since 1987 and this is his 10th book. He has also been an active environmentalist on his home island of Bermuda, co-founding three NGOs: protecting Bermuda's reef fish; saving its open spaces; and creating an umbrella environmental organization. Surrounded by ocean, the only fresh water available for centuries was by collected rainfall so his awareness of the vital importance of this precious resource, and the delicate balance required to maintain it, is acute and also reflected in this book.</p>
<p>‘Watercolours in a Second’ is a book of 250 abstract photographs of water reflections all taken at 1/250 of a second to create one second of exposure time. Taken over 25 years from 1987-2012, this book is a chronological journey through 22 countries starting and ending with Bermuda.</p>
<p>‘Watercolours in a Second’ also introduces a new genre of art called Self-Expressionism; inviting viewers to share their genuine subconscious and conscious interpretation of the shapes, faces, forms and patterns in each photograph. The photographs are not manipulated and are reality so each interpretation has validity, revealing multiple levels in each image. Self-Expressionism becomes a fun way to explore abstract imagery.</p>
<p>Quotes about art and creativity accompany each photograph, from the ancient Greeks through to present day; providing perspectives about art from different ages and temperaments.</p>

I could open any door. I had my own room. I knew I lived there. I saw members of my family. I had an unhappy childhood and I was raised by a mother with a difficult character. Despite my hard life, every evening I would go to bed hoping to dream of that beautiful place. Over the years, the castle stopped coming into my dreams. But the memory of it remained with me. I lived through a lot and I learnt a lot. I was not allowed to dream, my life was supposed to follow other people’s unrealised dreams. Years later, I managed to catch up with my own hopes. Journalism and teaching gave me a sense of self-importance. I interwove my life with my characters’ lives and I think I managed to write a good story for my readers; a story that tells a lot. According to history, everyone is given a chance if they want it. History gives everyone the opportunity to think whether they feel happy where they are and whether it is time for them to fly away. History searches through the soul and takes out embarrassing moments when we have made mistakes or we have been embarrassed. I collected souls and personages from my life-time adventure. As weird as this book is, it is real too, because all of us allow a bit of unreality into our lives, one way or the other. As long as it comes with a dose of happiness. Who would not open their door to happiness? Right?</p><p>I know that almost all of us promise a lot of things at the end of each year. Some say that next year they will be a new person. Others make big promises to shed bad habits. But when the time comes to actually do it, we stay the same. It is true that we spend the first few days of the New Year saying good-bye to our old selves but, the following week, we are back to our old routines and comforts.  So we go round in circles making the same or bigger promises. But how could we actually fulfil them? Is change possible or are we going to remain the ‘I will’ person for the rest of our lives? This book is the beginning. It is the first of a series which will give us the opportunity to think about how to make a successful change.

I am both a traditional and self-published author. I’ve sold over 150 short stories, 40 novels, and I <i>love</i> stories. A few of my favorite things include: gluten-free brownies (not necessarily glutton-free), Star Trek, steampunk aesthetics, fairies, Severus Snape, Captain Jack Sparrow, and Mr. Darcy.</p><p>By day, I’m a public school art teacher, artist, belly dance performer and instructor, copy editor, fashion designer, event organizer and probably a few other things. By night, I write. As you might imagine, this leaves little time for sleep.</p><p>The last fundraiser I remember taking part of was the school jog-a-thon in sixth grade.

<li>Witch-loving readers who enjoy a magical experience will have an opportunity to listen to a series about a magical boarding school through a teacher’s perspective in audio format.</li>
<li>The vision impaired can listen to these fun witchy mysteries.</li>
<li>Like many of my readers, I love listening to audiobooks. People have busy lives and often we wouldn’t be able to squeeze in our passion for reading if we couldn’t listen to books in the car, while exercising, washing the dishes, waiting in a long line at the DMV, and while doing a quiet activity like using a jackhammer on concrete. (Just kidding! I was just checking to see if you were still reading.) This is a medium for storytelling that I passionately believe in and want to make available to others.</li>
<li>You will be helping me plant seeds in the minds of the masses what it is like to be an art teacher in a public-school setting. (Did you really think those scenes of Clarissa teaching in overcrowded classrooms, budget cuts, or teachers who used her to babysit her students were really fictional?)</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569621786/ofl3woenk27cldsskdqx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>What You Get Out of This</strong></p><p>Let’s talk about some things you get out of funding this project a.k.a. the fun part of this fundraiser.</p><ul>
<li>I have some unique perks (which I think of as thank-you presents) that will be appreciated by fans of the series! I have an e-book available only through this fundraiser called: <i>Ghoulish Charms</i>, the first book in the Vega Bloodmire Cozy Witch Mystery Series (which I managed to make PG-rated and completely free of sex and swear words while keeping Vega’s snark intact), original artwork from the book covers that I designed myself, and some fun witchy gifts.</li>
<li>Also, I would like to offer the first book or books produced as a free gift to contributors prior to being published on Audible.</li>
<li>I have perks I only offer to fans who are already on my newsletter as additional incentives that are not open to the public, so stay tuned on those details. If you aren't signed up, see the link below.</li>
<li>Rest assured, if I do not meet the benchmark of being able to produce one book in the series, I will hold onto the proceeds until I gather enough proceeds for the first book.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p><strong>Details and Reasons Funding is Needed</strong></p><p>Here are some details about the project so you understand the need for fundraising.</p><ul>
<li>If I can raise $2000, I can produce the first book in the series. This will take 2-4 months for the narrator to record, edit, for me to listen to and make changes, then for those changes to be implemented, and for the digital packaging and distribution onto Audible or another retailer.</li>
<li> If I raise $5000, that will help me produce the first and second book in the series. Those are the shortest books in the series.</li>
<li>The third book requires a narrator who can handle all the accents—and there are a lot. Also, it has to be someone willing to read my weird Red affinity magic scenes. I’ve already been told that tattoo scene is waaaaay too risqué for some. I have an actress in mind and have been in discussion with her, but I’m a lot like Vega Bloodmire; I have champagne tastes on a school-teacher salary. The narrator will cost $5000 for that book alone. She is very much worth it.</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">That means I need to raise $10,000 for the first three books.</p><ul>
<li> My tax accountant told me to reality check myself before I wreck myself.  I'm not a non-profit. I have to pay taxes on this income earned. So she reminded me to keep that in mind when making plans, and when collecting and spending funds.</li>
<li>Producing an audiobook is costly and all that money is needed upfront. Royalties accumulate slowly. I have a day job as a school teacher. There is no way I can afford to produce an eighteen-book series of audiobooks. That means I need assistance making this dream a reality, one book at a time. In order to do so, I need help getting started with the first books.</li>
<li>People have been asking me for over a year, “Do you have an audiobook of this series?” or “When are you going to make an audiobook?” or the worst question, “If it is too expensive, why don’t you just purchase the sound equipment, learn to edit audio files, practice all the accents in your spare time, and narrate it yourself?”</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Ugh! Just because I can imagine Felix Thatch’s voice in my head, doesn’t mean I can speak with a received pronunciation British accent. And I’ve been told that my French accent sounds Russian. Let’s not get started on my luddite skills and unwillingness to part with my precious writing time to learn a new skill. And have I ever mentioned I am very much like Clarissa? Sometimes my computer stops working when I am near, but it works perfectly fine for my husband who doesn’t believe in magic (because he is a Morty). I don’t want to accidentally blow up all that expensive sound equipment.</p><div> </div><div>

<li>I will produce audiobooks and enrich the lives of others through literacy. Or at the very least, entertain them with fun witchy reads.</li>
<li>Many people depend on audiobooks for their source of literature due to preference, literacy level, or vision impairment. Your contribution will help support that.</li>
<li>
<i>Tardy Bells and Witches' Spells</i>, the first book in the series has sold over 10,000 copies and has been an Amazon bestseller. Though success in Kindle format doesn’t guarantee audiobook success, it does mean there is a good chance that it will be listened to.</li>
<li>I have a track record for working hard and being professional in my goals. On average, I have put out one book a month for over a year. Some of them were 30,000 words and some were 120,000 words but a book a month.</li>
<li>Help me make a living doing what I love—art and writing. The picture below sums up my life effectively on average.</li>

One of my friends who is an author produced an audiobook a year ago and has remarked that making an audiobook killed his soul. That’s <i>my</i> biggest risk.

</div></div>","Womby’s School for Wayward Witches—In Audiobook format!Hi, I’m Sarina Dorie, fantasy and science fiction author—but I can also add mystery, romance and humor to that list. I am both a traditional and self-published author. I’ve sold over 150 short stories, 40 novels, and I love stories. A few of my favorite things include: gluten-free brownies (not necessarily glutton-free), Star Trek, steampunk aesthetics, fairies, Severus Snape, Captain Jack Sparrow, and Mr. Darcy.By day, I’m a public school art teacher, artist, belly dance performer and instructor, copy editor, fashion designer, event organizer and probably a few other things. By night, I write. As you might imagine, this leaves little time for sleep.The last fundraiser I remember taking part of was the school jog-a-thon in sixth grade. I now am about to ask for assistance with another, though one of my own making.Here are a few reasons I am enthusiastic about producing an audiobook of my not-so-cozy witch mystery series and why I think it is important.
Witch-loving readers who enjoy a magical experience will have an opportunity to listen to a series about a magical boarding school through a teacher’s perspective in audio format.
The vision impaired can listen to these fun witchy mysteries.
Like many of my readers, I love listening to audiobooks. People have busy lives and often we wouldn’t be able to squeeze in our passion for reading if we couldn’t listen to books in the car, while exercising, washing the dishes, waiting in a long line at the DMV, and while doing a quiet activity like using a jackhammer on concrete. (Just kidding! I was just checking to see if you were still reading.) This is a medium for storytelling that I passionately believe in and want to make available to others.
You will be helping me plant seeds in the minds of the masses what it is like to be an art teacher in a public-school setting. (Did you really think those scenes of Clarissa teaching in overcrowded classrooms, budget cuts, or teachers who used her to babysit her students were really fictional?)
What You Get Out of ThisLet’s talk about some things you get out of funding this project a.k.a. the fun part of this fundraiser.
I have some unique perks (which I think of as thank-you presents) that will be appreciated by fans of the series! I have an e-book available only through this fundraiser called: Ghoulish Charms, the first book in the Vega Bloodmire Cozy Witch Mystery Series (which I managed to make PG-rated and completely free of sex and swear words while keeping Vega’s snark intact), original artwork from the book covers that I designed myself, and some fun witchy gifts.
Also, I would like to offer the first book or books produced as a free gift to contributors prior to being published on Audible.
I have perks I only offer to fans who are already on my newsletter as additional incentives that are not open to the public, so stay tuned on those details. If you aren't signed up, see the link below.
Rest assured, if I do not meet the benchmark of being able to produce one book in the series, I will hold onto the proceeds until I gather enough proceeds for the first book.
 Details and Reasons Funding is NeededHere are some details about the project so you understand the need for fundraising.
If I can raise $2000, I can produce the first book in the series. This will take 2-4 months for the narrator to record, edit, for me to listen to and make changes, then for those changes to be implemented, and for the digital packaging and distribution onto Audible or another retailer.
 If I raise $5000, that will help me produce the first and second book in the series. Those are the shortest books in the series.
The third book requires a narrator who can handle all the accents—and there are a lot. Also, it has to be someone willing to read my weird Red affinity magic scenes. I’ve already been told that tattoo scene is waaaaay too risqué for some. I have an actress in mind and have been in discussion with her, but I’m a lot like Vega Bloodmire; I have champagne tastes on a school-teacher salary. The narrator will cost $5000 for that book alone. She is very much worth it.
That means I need to raise $10,000 for the first three books.
 My tax accountant told me to reality check myself before I wreck myself.  I'm not a non-profit. I have to pay taxes on this income earned. So she reminded me to keep that in mind when making plans, and when collecting and spending funds.
Producing an audiobook is costly and all that money is needed upfront. Royalties accumulate slowly. I have a day job as a school teacher. There is no way I can afford to produce an eighteen-book series of audiobooks. That means I need assistance making this dream a reality, one book at a time. In order to do so, I need help getting started with the first books.
People have been asking me for over a year, “Do you have an audiobook of this series?” or “When are you going to make an audiobook?” or the worst question, “If it is too expensive, why don’t you just purchase the sound equipment, learn to edit audio files, practice all the accents in your spare time, and narrate it yourself?”
Ugh! Just because I can imagine Felix Thatch’s voice in my head, doesn’t mean I can speak with a received pronunciation British accent. And I’ve been told that my French accent sounds Russian. Let’s not get started on my luddite skills and unwillingness to part with my precious writing time to learn a new skill. And have I ever mentioned I am very much like Clarissa? Sometimes my computer stops working when I am near, but it works perfectly fine for my husband who doesn’t believe in magic (because he is a Morty). I don’t want to accidentally blow up all that expensive sound equipment. 

 
The ImpactWith your contribution, I am going to be able to do the following:
I will produce audiobooks and enrich the lives of others through literacy. Or at the very least, entertain them with fun witchy reads.
Many people depend on audiobooks for their source of literature due to preference, literacy level, or vision impairment. Your contribution will help support that.

Tardy Bells and Witches' Spells, the first book in the series has sold over 10,000 copies and has been an Amazon bestseller. Though success in Kindle format doesn’t guarantee audiobook success, it does mean there is a good chance that it will be listened to.
I have a track record for working hard and being professional in my goals. On average, I have put out one book a month for over a year. Some of them were 30,000 words and some were 120,000 words but a book a month.
Help me make a living doing what I love—art and writing. The picture below sums up my life effectively on average.
Risks & ChallengesThough listening to audiobooks is my preferred method of reading, this is the first time I have created an audiobook. One of my friends who is an author produced an audiobook a year ago and has remarked that making an audiobook killed his soul. That’s my biggest risk. I would like to avoid that.For you as a reader, your biggest risk is investing in a project and then hating a narrator’s voice and not wanting to listen to the book. As an audiobook listener myself, I know how that is. There are times I have listened to a book and the female voices are too high and shrill or the male voices sound forced and dopey. The accents might be horrible or there might be other problems that make a listener cringe. Here are somethings I have in place to help me finish this project and alleviate those worries.

So much that I have decided to finally give an answer to this question.</p><p>Well, to all of my horology comrades, <u>this time is now</u>.</p><h3>I am writing a book about watches</h3><p>During these <strong>years of writing, and over 14 million views by all of my readers</strong>, I have seen a great participation and interest about watches, and more specifically, about how I explain watches and watchmaking. A lot of you, in your comments, have asked me to collect all of the material I publish and create a handy, compact guide out of it.</p><p>Well, here it is.</p><p>This is the book I would have loved to read when I started out in watches!</p><p>Its name is “<strong>The Watch Manual</strong>”, and I have already registered the domain name, so when everything will be ready, you will find a brand new website built around it, where you could buy and download your soft copy.</p><h3>This is a book for everyone interested in watches</h3><p>Looking around the watch publishing landscape, <i>I have not found a simple, straightforward manual about watches dedicated to everyone who is not an expert</i>, and would like to become, if not a true expert, at least a more informed reader.</p><p>So, the manual I am writing is organized around short, focused chapters made to be quickly readable and easy to understand, using the same no-nonsense language I am using to explain the craft of horology to my readers.</p><p><strong>Quick, easy, simple to understand, yet precise</strong>. Perfect to get to know about watches and all the world that surrounds them: how to find them, to buy them, to check them, to wear them, to sell them (and get a profit).</p><p>The goal is to make it available in soft and hard copy.

So much that I have decided to finally give an answer to this question.Well, to all of my horology comrades, this time is now.I am writing a book about watchesDuring these years of writing, and over 14 million views by all of my readers, I have seen a great participation and interest about watches, and more specifically, about how I explain watches and watchmaking. A lot of you, in your comments, have asked me to collect all of the material I publish and create a handy, compact guide out of it.Well, here it is.This is the book I would have loved to read when I started out in watches!Its name is “The Watch Manual”, and I have already registered the domain name, so when everything will be ready, you will find a brand new website built around it, where you could buy and download your soft copy.This is a book for everyone interested in watchesLooking around the watch publishing landscape, I have not found a simple, straightforward manual about watches dedicated to everyone who is not an expert, and would like to become, if not a true expert, at least a more informed reader.So, the manual I am writing is organized around short, focused chapters made to be quickly readable and easy to understand, using the same no-nonsense language I am using to explain the craft of horology to my readers.Quick, easy, simple to understand, yet precise. Perfect to get to know about watches and all the world that surrounds them: how to find them, to buy them, to check them, to wear them, to sell them (and get a profit).The goal is to make it available in soft and hard copy. First in English, and then, translated in other languages.It will be a thorough primer of horology!This will be the index, so you could check just how detailed it is going to be.It is full of practical advice - over 600 pages of content that you could use immediately.SECTION 1 - HISTORY OF WATCHMAKING1.0    -    Introduction and history    pag.    121.1    -    Measuring time: the beginning    pag.    151.2     -    The evolution of time-keeping:        days, hours and the first clocks    pag.    191.3     -    Peter Henlein and the invention        of the first portable clocks    pag.    241.4     -    The rise and fall of British watchmaking    pag.    281.5     -    Lépine and the revolution of calibers    pag.    331.6     -    The genius of Bréguet    pag.    361.7     -    Watches and serial production:        the rebels of watchmaking    pag.    391.8     -    Pocket watches go to the wrist    pag.    431.9     -    Louis Cartier and the Santos    pag.    461.10     -    The Bauhaus and Max Bill    pag.    491.11     -    The Golden Age of horology    pag.    521.12     -    Gerald Genta     pag.    541.13     -    The Quartz Crisis    pag.    581.14     -    The recovery of the watch market    pag.    611.15     -    Horology today: the trends    pag.    64SECTION 2 -

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This campaign is intended to</strong> fund the writing and production of a book: <i>The Cognitive Continuum</i> (The CC). This book is based on intellectual work by Dr. John Vervaeke and Daniel Greig. We will draw on content from John’s webseries, <i>Awakening the Meaning Crisis</i>, as the foundation for the CC. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is this book about?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the CC, we propose a theoretical framework for enlightenment based on the idea of optimal grip, which has its roots in the philosophical tradition of phenomenology. Enlightenment is all about optimal and ethical relationships between self, world, and other. The ""cognitive continuum"" refers to a set of neurocognitive functions, starting in insight, and culminating in the experience of mystical union. We argue that the optimal grip on reality that is characteristic of enlightenment is cultivated by using a set of practices that train this continuum of functions. The result of this training is a flexible and dynamic state of being infused with a sense of meaningfulness and connection. We will weave together the teachings of the world’s traditions of religion and philosophy with research based cognitive science to create this framework. This book will feature three parts:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Part I: Heaven - Illuminates the philosophy behind enlightenment</p>
<p>Part 2: Earth - Illuminates the science behind enlightenment</p>
<p>Part 3: The Way - Provides personal and social guidelines for the cultivation of enlightenment</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prints of <i>Cosmic Dance, </i>which will be featured in Part 1: Heaven, is available as a perk! If you would like to know more about these ideas before contributing, <a href=""https://psychedelicstoday.com/2020/01/14/daniel-greig-the-cognitive-continuum-from-insight-to-enlightenment/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a> to listen to Daniel discuss the book on <i>Psychedelics Today.</i></p>

<p>In a year, we have managed to consolidate a team of journalists who work with sensibility and passion in the search for truth, with courage to communicate events both to Venezuelans and to those who live outside the country.</p>
<p>EC’s strategy is based on a community-driven newsroom. It seamlessly integrates social networks into the reporting process by using Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp communities to generate story ideas and keep the audience up to date on breaking news. This structure is the inspiration for the name Efecto Cocuyo, which in English means “Firefly Effect.” We are  the product of thousands  of tiny sparks, which together can illuminate an entire nation.</p>
<p>/</p>
<ul><li><strong>Nuestra historia</strong></li></ul>
<p>Efecto Cocuyo es un medio y es una causa. Somos un grupo de periodistas venezolanas que asumimos en enero de 2015 el riesgo de emprender una plataforma de información e investigación independiente en un entorno caracterizado por el hostigamiento, el amedrentamiento y los obstáculos al libre ejercicio del periodismo. </p>
<p>En un año hemos logrado consolidar un equipo de periodistas que trabaja con sensibilidad y pasión por la búsqueda de la verdad, para comunicar los hechos que desde el poder pretenden ocultar. Nuestra cobertura de la escasez de medicamentos en Venezuela y su impacto en los más vulnerables, los niños venezolanos, nos hizo finalistas del Premio Gabriel García Márquez 2016.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Our 2016 crowdfunding: Fearless coverage</strong></li></ul>
<p>This campaign is supported on your sensibility and in the belief that we can shine brighter together.  In order to achieve our goals, and in the knowledge of how essential free, responsible and quality press is for democracy, we need resources to sustain and continue Efecto Cocuyo.</p>
<p>The most inspiring thing is that everybody who support free press and democratic values, can be a Cocuyo. You are invited to join us.<br/>A large scale citizen micro-financing plan was our first source of support in 2015 with more that $26,000 collected. These funds allowed us, among other things, to innovate in Venezuela’s media system, with initiatives that integrate users and journalists through the use of social networks and tools such as WhatsApp, which we use as a channel for crowdsourcing and distribution of information. For 2016-2017, we want to get to more people and support our country’s transformation through journalism, fighting for spaces to provide visibility to citizens and their needs.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Nuestra campaña 2016: ¿Quién dijo miedo?</strong> </li></ul>
<p>Somos un medio de comunicación libre e independiente, que usa todas sus plataformas para el libre ejercicio del periodismo y el acceso a la información.  Dejamos el miedo a un lado cuando investigamos, abordamos y desarrollamos los temas que interesan y preocupan a las personas. Le damos la voz a los protagonistas, a la gente.</p>
<p>Esta campaña se apoya en tu sensibilidad y en la creencia de que juntos podemos alumbrar más. Por ello tu donación es importante para garantizar la independencia de un medio emergente en una sociedad en la cual el Estado ejerce una hegemonía comunicacional.</p>
<p>Conscientes de lo fundamental que es para una democracia el periodismo libre, responsable y de calidad, requerimos recursos para darle sostenibilidad y continuidad a Efecto Cocuyo. </p>
<ul><li><b>How will you impact journalism in Venezuela </b></li></ul>
<p>Each and every one of your contributions will allow Efecto Cocuyo to shine brighter, solidifying the use of audiovisual platforms with which we’ll be able to explore the new transmedia storytelling, an approach to investigation that will focus on matters of sensibility and social impact; a fact-checking unit; the second edition of the school for young journalists, and also a Journalism and Participation program which seeks to increase interaction with our audiences and practice journalism with a social impact.</p> <p>We need to collect at least $40,000 to be able to finance for a year, the operation of our site, composed by 14 young journalists, as well as starting projects to allow us to consolidate our own sources of income. Venezuela faces an economic crisis marked by inflation estimated to peak over 700% by the end of the year. These figures threaten small companies like ours, which was created only a year ago, and that’s why your support is vital to guarantee our operation in the short and medium term.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</strong></li></ul>
<p>La contribución de cada uno de ustedes permitirá que Efecto Cocuyo ilumine más, fortaleciendo: una plataforma audiovisual para explorar nuevas narrativas transmedias, un eje de investigación que pondrá el acento en temas de sensibilidad e impacto social, la segunda edición de la escuela para jóvenes periodistas, un programa de periodismo y participación para aumentar la interacción con nuestras audiencias y hacer periodismo de la mano de la gente, así como el mantenimiento y funcionamiento de nuestra plataforma tecnológica.</p>
<p>Necesitamos recaudar al menos 40 mil dólares para poder financiar durante un año la operatividad de nuestra redacción, integrada por 15 jóvenes periodistas, así como definir un modelo financiero que nos permitan consolidar la generación de ingresos propios. Venezuela enfrenta una crisis económica marcada por una inflación cuyas estimaciones superan el 700% para el cierre de año, cifra que aún siendo conversadora constituye una amenaza para pequeñas empresas como la nuestra que apenas tiene un año de constituida, de allí que tu apoyo sea vital para garantizar nuestro funcionamiento a corto y mediano plazo.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Cómo invertiremos el dinero</strong></li></ul>
<p>Necesitamos dinero y muchos recursos más para garantizar nuestra sostenibilidad y cumplir con los proyectos que nos hemos planteado. Los fondos que obtengamos gracias a tu contribución se utilizarán de la siguiente manera:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Plataforma audiovisual.</i> Exploración de nuevas narrativas transmedias. 15% de lo recaudado</li>
<li>
<i>Coberturas especial electoral 2016-2017</i>. 20% de lo recaudado</li>

</li></ul>
<p>Publicamos informaciones meticulosamente verificadas y reportajes que permiten comprender lo que ocurre en Venezuela.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.1pt;"">Participamos en proyectos de investigación de largo alcance como <strong>PanamaPapers</strong>, día a día contamos las historias que reflejan la crisis venezolana y que han llamado a la acción ciudadana, especialmente frente a la carencia de medicamentos.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.1pt;"">Fuimos el sitio más confiable e imparcial en la cobertura del proceso electoral del 6 de diciembre de 2015, de acuerdo con un monitoreo realizado por una organización independiente.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.1pt;"">Realizamos una serie de reportajes sobre la escasez de medicamentos en Venezuela con los cuales ayudamos a salvar vidas. Este esfuerzo editorial fue reconocido por la Fundación para un Nuevo Periodismo Iberoamericano al escogernos entre los finalistas del Premio Gabriel García Márquez.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.1pt;"">Realizamos la primera edición de la Escuela Cocuyo que permitió el adiestramiento de 25 jóvenes periodistas de Caracas y del interior de Venezuela en el manejo de dispositivos móviles para coberturas en tiempo real.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.1pt;"">Emprendimos un programa de periodismo y participación que nos ha permitido conectarnos con audiencias de diferentes regiones de Venezuela y fuera del país, recogiendo propuestas para mejorar nuestros enfoques,</p>
<h3> <strong>Riesgos y desafíos</strong>
</h3>
<ul><li> <strong>Un problema</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>En Venezuela han ido desapareciendo  los espacios profesionales para el libre ejercicio del periodismo.  Los periodistas  han sido blanco de acciones directas de intimidación y agresión. También han sido afectados de manera colectiva mediante de la compra agresiva y sistemática de medios de comunicación. Los nuevos propietarios de la mayoría de la estructura de medios que eran independientes han impuesto un clima de censura y autocensura. Es uno de los momentos más oscuros del periodismo, y sin embargo en medio de la crisis hay una oportunidad.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Una solución</strong></li></ul>
<p>También es un momento de luz en Venezuela. Asumimos el periodismo libre e independiente como una causa, por la cual vale la pena luchar. Creamos Efecto Cocuyo, un sitio que en menos de 12 meses  se posicionó como un medio confiable, responsable y con una alta conexión con sus usuarios.</p>
<p>Tenemos un equipo para enfrentar, sin miedo, los obstáculos al acceso a la información y luchar por una sociedad transformadora. Trabajamos en la exploración de nuevos productos editoriales y propuestas que nos pongan en sintonía con las audiencias. Queremos innovar, crear, iluminar, y para ello necesitamos de tu apoyo al donar a nuestra causa o compartir esta información para que se multiplique y logremos alcanzar nuestra meta. Tu pones tu ayuda y nosotros tenemos:</p>
<ul>
<li>Somos un equipo multidisciplinario liderado por mujeres con experiencia en el periodismo y reporterismo, preparadas para gerenciar un medio y transmitir este conocimiento a las nuevas generaciones.</li>
<li>Un equipo de jóvenes comprometidos, con gran sensibilidad social, que conoce los obstáculos y con valentía los supera.</li>
<li>Creemos en la planificación como piedra angular para emprender.</li>
<li>Enfrentamos los cambios y surfeamos las olas, sin dejar a un lado nuestros principios.</li>
<li>Creemos en el trabajo colectivo, en la pluralidad y en el periodismo que se hace con la gente.</li>

This campaign is supported on your sensibility and in the belief that we can shine brighter together.  In order to achieve our goals, and in the knowledge of how essential free, responsible and quality press is for democracy, we need resources to sustain and continue Efecto Cocuyo.
The most inspiring thing is that everybody who support free press and democratic values, can be a Cocuyo. You are invited to join us.A large scale citizen micro-financing plan was our first source of support in 2015 with more that $26,000 collected. These funds allowed us, among other things, to innovate in Venezuela’s media system, with initiatives that integrate users and journalists through the use of social networks and tools such as WhatsApp, which we use as a channel for crowdsourcing and distribution of information. For 2016-2017, we want to get to more people and support our country’s transformation through journalism, fighting for spaces to provide visibility to citizens and their needs.

Nuestra campaña 2016: ¿Quién dijo miedo? 
Somos un medio de comunicación libre e independiente, que usa todas sus plataformas para el libre ejercicio del periodismo y el acceso a la información.  Dejamos el miedo a un lado cuando investigamos, abordamos y desarrollamos los temas que interesan y preocupan a las personas. Le damos la voz a los protagonistas, a la gente.
Esta campaña se apoya en tu sensibilidad y en la creencia de que juntos podemos alumbrar más. Por ello tu donación es importante para garantizar la independencia de un medio emergente en una sociedad en la cual el Estado ejerce una hegemonía comunicacional.
Conscientes de lo fundamental que es para una democracia el periodismo libre, responsable y de calidad, requerimos recursos para darle sostenibilidad y continuidad a Efecto Cocuyo. 
How will you impact journalism in Venezuela 
Each and every one of your contributions will allow Efecto Cocuyo to shine brighter, solidifying the use of audiovisual platforms with which we’ll be able to explore the new transmedia storytelling, an approach to investigation that will focus on matters of sensibility and social impact; a fact-checking unit; the second edition of the school for young journalists, and also a Journalism and Participation program which seeks to increase interaction with our audiences and practice journalism with a social impact. We need to collect at least $40,000 to be able to finance for a year, the operation of our site, composed by 14 young journalists, as well as starting projects to allow us to consolidate our own sources of income. Venezuela faces an economic crisis marked by inflation estimated to peak over 700% by the end of the year. These figures threaten small companies like ours, which was created only a year ago, and that’s why your support is vital to guarantee our operation in the short and medium term.
Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes
La contribución de cada uno de ustedes permitirá que Efecto Cocuyo ilumine más, fortaleciendo: una plataforma audiovisual para explorar nuevas narrativas transmedias, un eje de investigación que pondrá el acento en temas de sensibilidad e impacto social, la segunda edición de la escuela para jóvenes periodistas, un programa de periodismo y participación para aumentar la interacción con nuestras audiencias y hacer periodismo de la mano de la gente, así como el mantenimiento y funcionamiento de nuestra plataforma tecnológica.
Necesitamos recaudar al menos 40 mil dólares para poder financiar durante un año la operatividad de nuestra redacción, integrada por 15 jóvenes periodistas, así como definir un modelo financiero que nos permitan consolidar la generación de ingresos propios. Venezuela enfrenta una crisis económica marcada por una inflación cuyas estimaciones superan el 700% para el cierre de año, cifra que aún siendo conversadora constituye una amenaza para pequeñas empresas como la nuestra que apenas tiene un año de constituida, de allí que tu apoyo sea vital para garantizar nuestro funcionamiento a corto y mediano plazo.
Cómo invertiremos el dinero
Necesitamos dinero y muchos recursos más para garantizar nuestra sostenibilidad y cumplir con los proyectos que nos hemos planteado. Los fondos que obtengamos gracias a tu contribución se utilizarán de la siguiente manera:


Plataforma audiovisual. Exploración de nuevas narrativas transmedias. 15% de lo recaudado

Coberturas especial electoral 2016-2017. 20% de lo recaudado

2da Escuela Cocuyo. Formación de jóvenes periodistas. 10% de lo recaudado

Programa de mejoramiento profesional para Cocuyos.  30% de lo recaudado
Programa de Periodismo y Participación. Comunidad, redes. 15% de lo recaudado

Funcionamiento y soporte tecnológico. 10% de los recaudado.

El impacto
 Lo que hicimos en 2015-2016 en Efecto Cocuyo

Publicamos informaciones meticulosamente verificadas y reportajes que permiten comprender lo que ocurre en Venezuela.
Participamos en proyectos de investigación de largo alcance como PanamaPapers, día a día contamos las historias que reflejan la crisis venezolana y que han llamado a la acción ciudadana, especialmente frente a la carencia de medicamentos.
Fuimos el sitio más confiable e imparcial en la cobertura del proceso electoral del 6 de diciembre de 2015, de acuerdo con un monitoreo realizado por una organización independiente.
Realizamos una serie de reportajes sobre la escasez de medicamentos en Venezuela con los cuales ayudamos a salvar vidas. Este esfuerzo editorial fue reconocido por la Fundación para un Nuevo Periodismo Iberoamericano al escogernos entre los finalistas del Premio Gabriel García Márquez.
Realizamos la primera edición de la Escuela Cocuyo que permitió el adiestramiento de 25 jóvenes periodistas de Caracas y del interior de Venezuela en el manejo de dispositivos móviles para coberturas en tiempo real.
Emprendimos un programa de periodismo y participación que nos ha permitido conectarnos con audiencias de diferentes regiones de Venezuela y fuera del país, recogiendo propuestas para mejorar nuestros enfoques,
 Riesgos y desafíos

 Un problema

En Venezuela han ido desapareciendo  los espacios profesionales para el libre ejercicio del periodismo.  Los periodistas  han sido blanco de acciones directas de intimidación y agresión. También han sido afectados de manera colectiva mediante de la compra agresiva y sistemática de medios de comunicación. Los nuevos propietarios de la mayoría de la estructura de medios que eran independientes han impuesto un clima de censura y autocensura. Es uno de los momentos más oscuros del periodismo, y sin embargo en medio de la crisis hay una oportunidad.
Una solución
También es un momento de luz en Venezuela. Asumimos el periodismo libre e independiente como una causa, por la cual vale la pena luchar. Creamos Efecto Cocuyo, un sitio que en menos de 12 meses  se posicionó como un medio confiable, responsable y con una alta conexión con sus usuarios.
Tenemos un equipo para enfrentar, sin miedo, los obstáculos al acceso a la información y luchar por una sociedad transformadora. Trabajamos en la exploración de nuevos productos editoriales y propuestas que nos pongan en sintonía con las audiencias. Queremos innovar, crear, iluminar, y para ello necesitamos de tu apoyo al donar a nuestra causa o compartir esta información para que se multiplique y logremos alcanzar nuestra meta. Tu pones tu ayuda y nosotros tenemos:

Somos un equipo multidisciplinario liderado por mujeres con experiencia en el periodismo y reporterismo, preparadas para gerenciar un medio y transmitir este conocimiento a las nuevas generaciones.
Un equipo de jóvenes comprometidos, con gran sensibilidad social, que conoce los obstáculos y con valentía los supera.
Creemos en la planificación como piedra angular para emprender.
Enfrentamos los cambios y surfeamos las olas, sin dejar a un lado nuestros principios.
Creemos en el trabajo colectivo, en la pluralidad y en el periodismo que se hace con la gente.
Creemos en Venezuela y en sus potencialidades.
Nuestra pasión es el periodismo.

What is The Colour of Madness?2. Who are you?3. What are the perks?4. How will the money be used?5. I have no money, how can I help?6. Can submit work to the anthology? 1. WHAT IS THE COLOUR OF MADNESS?  The Colour of Madness is a seminal anthology, comprised of poetry, fiction, essays, memoirs and art submitted by BAME writers, academics, mental health workers, artists and those who are still navigating life with mental health problems.  BAME mental health is seriously underfunded and largely ignored by the community.  Our mission is to raise awareness about the serious issues surrounding BAME mental health all the way to Number 10 and start some robust dialogue that will change the way marginalised sectors of society with mental health issues are treated.   2. WHO ARE YOU? The Editor: Samara LintonSamara Linton is a final-year medical student at University College London and a University of Cambridge graduate. She has published research on mental health stigma and frequently writes about gender, race and health for various online publications. In 2016, she was awarded Best New Journalist at the Ending Violence Against Women Media Awards for her work on the mental health of black women and the experiences of migrant women in UK detention centres. Samara is particularly interested in the role of communities in tackling oppression, and March 2016 saw the Parliamentary launch of the report she co-edited for the Africa All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Ebola crisis and the role of communities in strengthening health systems. Samara welcomes the opportunity to create a platform for people from BAME communities to shape conversations about mental health in the UK.  Samara will be reviewing and editing the submissions to be included in the anthology.The Associate Editor: Rianna WalcottRianna Walcott is a PhD candidate at Kings College London, where she is researching how women of colour form communities in digital spaces, following an English literature undergraduate and masters degree at Edinburgh University. She is passionate about decolonising curricula and promoting diversity in academia, and co-founded projectmyopia.com in pursuit of that goal: a website that crowdsources recommendations and reviews of diverse materials for inclusion in curricula.As a black woman who suffers from poor mental health, and who was turned away by a white mental healthcare professional in a time of need, Rianna is adamant about the need for more BAME healthcare professionals who are sensitive to contemporary BAME needs and issues, and who are able to recognise that trauma may look different on a non-white face.The Publisher: Stirling PublishingWhen Tabatha Stirling (Stirling Publishing) approached Rianna Walcott about an idea for an anthology about BAME mental health issues at a Creative Edinburgh conference day, The Colour Of Madness was born.Tabatha Stirling is a writer and poet living in Edinburgh and founder of Stirling Publishing.  Her publishing credits include Spelk fiction, Camroc Fiction Press, Literary Orphans, Mslexia, Feminine Collective, Sick Lit Mag, Twisted Sister, Bright Sleep Magazine, The Magnolia Review and her novel, Blood On The Banana Leaf, exploring maid abuses in Singapore was signed by Unbound in 2016.  Tabatha is Bipolar Type II and has experienced mental health suffering from both patient and therapist viewpoints, and from the multiple stays in psychiatric facilities during her 20's and 30's.Laura Maria Grierson is the editorial assistant at Stirling Publishing. After finishing her BA in English Studies with Creative Writing with a First, Laura completed her MA in Creative Writing with a distinction. During her time at Teesside University, she had three poems published in The Teesside Literary Society Inaugural Anthology (2016).  3.

<h3><i>Guinea Hogs Lost and Found: A Recent History</i></h3>
<p><u>Synopsis</u></p>
<p>This is the very first book ever written on the subject of a rare, heritage livestock hog - the Guinea Hog. It is a documentation of the breed's recent history, how it almost died out within the last 15 years, and how dedicated breeders have saved it, promoted it, and worked to keep it viable for future generations. This is a research project based on first person interviews and recovery and review of archival data, along with personal experiences and observations. Please support this work!</p>
<p><u>Who I am</u></p>
<p>My name is Cathy Payne. After spending over 33 years in the field of special education, I ""retired"" to a rural part of Northeast Georgia with my husband. Here we began learning how to produce our own food. My husband started a new service business. In 2010, at age 57, I became a farmer, with little advance preparation.</p>
<p><u>How it all Started</u></p>
<p>Everything about farming was new to me, and I depended on my planning and research skills to make it through each week - no, each day! When I discovered the Guinea Hog, I also discovered that little information was available to me. Nobody had written a book about the Guinea Hogs. I realized that if I wanted to read a book, I would have to write it first. Hence the beginning of my project. The completed book's working title is, <i>Guinea Hogs Lost and Found: The Amazing Grace of Breed Recovery</i>. In it, I explain why the Guinea Hogs became almost extinct by 2004. There were only 22 identified breeding hogs left at that time.</p>
<p><u>Book Content and Research Methods</u></p>
<p>In my first book about Guinea Hogs, I explore the cultural and agricultural influences that nearly led to their demise. I also share inspiring stories of those committed breeders and conservators who sought out and bred those remaining viable hogs and began a registry to record offspring and ancestors. I enlighten readers about the hog genetics that fell through the cracks and were almost lost forever. And I tell the story of more conservators and breeders who saved those precious genetics. Anyone who knows me at all knows that I am passionate about livestock breed conservation.  I'm dedicated to learning about and sharing my knowledge of the American Guinea Hog, a breed traditionally raised here in the Southeast. In talking to people about the hog, I discovered much more than I bargained for! I'm now involved in a project that involves people throughout the United States and so excited to get this information out for conservationists everywhere.</p>
<p>I've been interviewing people since 2013 to learn about the hogs and learned much more than I'd bargained for! I found stories of near extinction, heroic preservation efforts, anger and betrayal, natural disasters, terminal illness, farmers helping farmers, farmers helping pigs, and more.</p>
<p><u>Purpose of this Campaign</u></p>
<p>The time I'm spending to get the book completed and self published is taking me away from marketing my farm products and tending to other farm business. It is also generating additional expenses that won't produce income until the project is complete. So here is my Catch-22: I need to hire editors, proof readers, book designers, format experts and more. I want to get this book into the hands of conservationists and Guinea Hog breeders as soon as possible. I also need to pay the bills.  I have nearly 4 years of research notes and interview transcripts waiting to be transformed into an eye-opening book.  I don't need or want charity, although donations will be gratefully received and appreciated for those who are moved to give. Instead I am offering high quality farm perks to those who want to support my work. By supporting my campaign, you will be forever linked to this amazing breed and its story and you will get high value perks to remind you of this connection. Any amount from $5 to $500 or more will help! If you can't do this, please share the campaign with your friends on social media. You never know who might be interested.</p>
<p><u>Great Perks</u></p>
<p>I plan to offer 25 different perks over the next 4 weeks. I'll start the campaign with 11 perks. I'll add 5 additional perks each week, so stay in touch with the campaign and let your friends know. In the first week of the campaign there will be a secret perk just for friends in my social media groups who find my link for a limited edition perk. Why not make things interesting?</p>
<p><u>Why this Campaign Matters</u></p>
<p>Why should you care about the history of the Guinea Hogs? Our historical livestock in America are part of our culture, just like our architecture or our cuisine. History will repeat itself if we are not careful, and the Guinea Hog could revert to critically rare status. Information is needed to guide supporters of and breeders of these wonderful animals. They are well worth it. Let me tell you the story!</p>
<p><u>Monetary Goals</u></p>
<p>Three years of research does not come cheaply. Neither does breeding for particular historical lines of a breed. It means time for interviews, recording services, transcription services, editors, proof readers, jacket designers, formatting, publishing fees, and more. In the meantime I am breeding and retaining stock from each generation and providing pork to the community. I love every step of the process.</p>
<p>I've set a goal of $4,500 to finish the project. I have unique artisanal perks to share with those who are inspired to support me. These range from dried herb blends, herbs, cat treats, dog treats, wool batting, wool yarn, organic ginger and turmeric, breeding stock, chef services, and more! Just check them out. I plan to add new perks every week, so be sure to check back frequently for updates. Most items can be shipped to the continental United States, while others can be picked up on the farm if you are local to Elberton, Georgia.</p>
<p><u>My Record - I Deliver!</u></p>
<p>This is my third indiegogo campaign. I have a history of delivering 100% of perks. You can check out my website and Facebook pages to see pictures of my hogs and get a feel for me as a person. You can also read reviews at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/broadriverpastures"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/broadriverpastures</a>. You will note that people most often describe me as knowledgeable, helpful, and passionate about what I am doing.</p>
<p><u>My Vision</u></p>
<p>I have a dream to write this story down, share it with the world, and to make a difference in the future of this rare hog. Please help me make a difference!

Synopsis
This is the very first book ever written on the subject of a rare, heritage livestock hog - the Guinea Hog. It is a documentation of the breed's recent history, how it almost died out within the last 15 years, and how dedicated breeders have saved it, promoted it, and worked to keep it viable for future generations. This is a research project based on first person interviews and recovery and review of archival data, along with personal experiences and observations. Please support this work!
Who I am
My name is Cathy Payne. After spending over 33 years in the field of special education, I ""retired"" to a rural part of Northeast Georgia with my husband. Here we began learning how to produce our own food. My husband started a new service business. In 2010, at age 57, I became a farmer, with little advance preparation.
How it all Started
Everything about farming was new to me, and I depended on my planning and research skills to make it through each week - no, each day! When I discovered the Guinea Hog, I also discovered that little information was available to me. Nobody had written a book about the Guinea Hogs. I realized that if I wanted to read a book, I would have to write it first. Hence the beginning of my project. The completed book's working title is, Guinea Hogs Lost and Found: The Amazing Grace of Breed Recovery. In it, I explain why the Guinea Hogs became almost extinct by 2004. There were only 22 identified breeding hogs left at that time.
Book Content and Research Methods
In my first book about Guinea Hogs, I explore the cultural and agricultural influences that nearly led to their demise. I also share inspiring stories of those committed breeders and conservators who sought out and bred those remaining viable hogs and began a registry to record offspring and ancestors. I enlighten readers about the hog genetics that fell through the cracks and were almost lost forever. And I tell the story of more conservators and breeders who saved those precious genetics. Anyone who knows me at all knows that I am passionate about livestock breed conservation.  I'm dedicated to learning about and sharing my knowledge of the American Guinea Hog, a breed traditionally raised here in the Southeast. In talking to people about the hog, I discovered much more than I bargained for! I'm now involved in a project that involves people throughout the United States and so excited to get this information out for conservationists everywhere.
I've been interviewing people since 2013 to learn about the hogs and learned much more than I'd bargained for! I found stories of near extinction, heroic preservation efforts, anger and betrayal, natural disasters, terminal illness, farmers helping farmers, farmers helping pigs, and more.
Purpose of this Campaign

<p>Because everyone is born a dancer.</p>
<p>Because dance is not just a series of steps.</p>
<p>Because our moving bodies have great powers to transform pain into ecstasy.</p>
<p>And because our body deserves a voice.</p>
<p><strong>a Dance Mag was born.</strong></p>
<p>Launched in July 2018, issue 01 of<strong> </strong><strong>a Dance Mag</strong> explored the theme of <u>Transcendence</u>. It included stories from 14 countries and was sold in 17 cities around the world.</p>
<p>Issue 02 explores the theme of <u>Furor</u> and takes us on a new marvelous trip.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Sneak peek into</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Issue 02: Furor</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Join the community. </strong><strong>Pre-order your copy.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Issue 02 tells stories of people who embrace their rage, indignation, defiance, and a love of life that refuses to be subdued. They engage with their full ferocity to face the challenges that surround them. And they end up experiencing the little death that bring us renewed back to life.</p>
<p>In the <u>Furor</u> issue you will read about free-spirited artists who refused being crushed by established systems. You will read about creative forces transforming destruction into beauty and grace. And you will read about flames of hope shining bright in the darkest of nights.</p>

</div></div>","Because everyone is born a dancer.
Because dance is not just a series of steps.
Because our moving bodies have great powers to transform pain into ecstasy.
And because our body deserves a voice.
a Dance Mag was born.
Launched in July 2018, issue 01 of a Dance Mag explored the theme of Transcendence. It included stories from 14 countries and was sold in 17 cities around the world.
Issue 02 explores the theme of Furor and takes us on a new marvelous trip.
Sneak peek into
Issue 02: Furor
Join the community. Pre-order your copy.

 
Issue 02 tells stories of people who embrace their rage, indignation, defiance, and a love of life that refuses to be subdued. They engage with their full ferocity to face the challenges that surround them. And they end up experiencing the little death that bring us renewed back to life.
In the Furor issue you will read about free-spirited artists who refused being crushed by established systems. You will read about creative forces transforming destruction into beauty and grace. And you will read about flames of hope shining bright in the darkest of nights.


 
Why your support is needed?
a Dance Mag is an independent project that exists because of individuals who believe in it: the makers, the contributing-writers, and you: the readers. Printing and distributing are the biggest challenges facing independent publishing in general and this holds true for a Dance Mag. This is why your support is invaluable. It is a statement that you'd like this magazine to LIVE and that is enough to keep us going...

What magazine professionals say about a Dance Mag?
    Our latest Magazine of the Week is spectacular in concept, format, text and design.           –Jeremy Leslie, magCulture
a Dance Mag was so gratifying — spanning philosophy, identity and history, the Beirut-based magazine is giving our moving bodies a voice. –Grace Wang, Stack magazines
 The effect [of design] is surprising, because the magazine seems to move and dance, even without showing any dancer on its pages. –Giovanna Sala, mgzn
 
What our readers say?
You guys are a blessing. You are the first magazine that understands dance as a state of mind, not only technique. – Tanya from Beirut
A beautiful collection of essays on transcend(dance), starting with Sufi swirling and ending with Derrida in a techno club. Not only are the articles well researched but the printing and design of the issue are super-impressive. It’s a gorgeous thing to hold. –Rebecca from Berlin
Honestly, the best magazine I have ever bought. –Dunn from New York

<p>I'm a writer. My poems, short stories and essays have appeared in more than 250 publications, been anthologized, nominated and shortlisted for numerous prizes, and praised by luminaries including Norman Mailer and David Berman. I live in Brooklyn, New York, with my wife and daughter.</p>

<p>WATERSHED is the story of a troubled, pregnant woman, and the two men—a snake dealer with a sideline in secret messages and a billionaire living under a false name—who vie for her. As their struggle takes them  through a near-future America of anti-technology enclaves and illegal hospitals, where stockbrokers moonlight as assassins, nurses procure obscure pleasures, a deeper, deadlier mystery emerges.</p>

<p>“(T)he world of WATERSHED is a vibrant one, packed to the gills with absurd and yet oddly-believable detail – everything from a September 11th memorial service that involves a full-scale recreation of the original terrorist attack, to a man who gets off on being locked in a coffin with a bag full of cats... Dodds manages to make all this and more seem not just possible, but vivid and tangible too.... It’s the real deal…a strong contender to be one of the most interesting books you’ll read this year.” - IndieReader Reviews (4.7/5 Stars)</p>
<p>""The masterfully dystopian WATERSHED unpacks the future of a modern America that, while spectacular, nobody was expecting… It’s a future that, as Leonard Cohen sang, is murder. The revelations of prose in WATERSHED makes that murder enjoyable… one of the few things worth believing in.” - Two Thirds North</p>
<p>These days, t seems the only way to write fiction that's not out of date by the time it's finished is to have it take place in the future. That's what makes WATERSHED a topical and incisive adventure through a surprising but believable tomorrow. It's a uniquely optimistic look ahead.  </p>
<p>WATERSHED is something I've been working on for years now. I'm proud of it. And while self-publishing is a demanding, labor-intensive venture, this book is worth it.</p>

Through the stories of these families, the reader sees how Chávez came to power, positioned himself and managed to control the masses. The story involves the reader in the idiosyncrasies of the Venezuelan population while showing the strengths and weaknesses of the Chavista leader and his environment of ambition, control and power. In this way, the reader realizes how the country with the largest oil reserves in the world, who was once the place with the happiest people on earth, is submerged today in a terrible crisis.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>""A novel created from real stories of real people who lived and made the history of Venezuela in the last two decades""</strong></p><p>This story is told from the point of view of families that genuinely experienced the struggles that the book describes. Speaking from the point of view of these families allowed the writers to create a story that is historically very accurate, but also very humane, raw and powerful. It allows the reader to capture the delicacy of the subtle moments in the life of the characters and also to feel the pain and understand the magnitude of the events that occurred. It's a very real and very intimate reading experience.</p><p><strong>CONCEPT:</strong></p><p>The book is divided into 3 chapters: <i>I)</i><strong><i> Hope and Glory. </i></strong><i>II)</i><strong><i> Confrontation, Alliances and External Powers. </i></strong><i>III)</i><strong><i> Paranoia and Decadence. </i></strong>Three key stages of Chavism, between power, ambition, ingenuity, illusion, fantasy, black magic, witchcraft, appropriation, autocracy, destructuring, betrayal, frustration, gratitude, subsidies, obsession, and fortuitous disappearances.</p><p><strong>The name of the book</strong> is based on the popular expression: <strong><i>""Better to be a Tail of a Lion than a Head of a Mouse""</i> </strong>or vice versa,  or vice versa, meaning that it is better to be at the tail of the larger ones, than at the head of the smallest. Here we have adopted both ends ""Head of a Lion and Tail of a mouse"", representing, on one hand, the great “head” that was Chávez, who managed to occupy the highest position in his country. Although he was not an intellectual, he had great mental capacity, was intelligent, diligent for his purposes and aware of his ability to manipulate. Through his leadership, Chávez promoted to stay in the memory of the people as a historical character in the scale of Simon Bolivar and Jesus Christ. The tail, on the other hand, represents all the dirty and hidden moves which he took in order to achieve Chavism’s goals.</p><div>
<strong>The concept </strong>The concept is reflected in the illustration on the cover of the book: a large dark lion head, representing the leader and his circle, located on the left side, with his back to the right, or in accordance with Chávez, with his back to capitalism. On the right side, seen from the Chavist ideology as the negative side, is the tail, illustrating the connection from the highest position down to the last one of the line, and from capitalism to socialism, all connected and involved in the misfortune of the country. </div><div> </div><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>¿And you? <br/><i>¿Do you want to be a Tail of a Lion or a Head of a Mouse?</i></strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong>WHY?: </strong> </p><p>Our generation has the responsibility to deeply understand and leave a printed record for future generations about what's going on now in Venezuela and what has happened in the past two decades.</p><p>It is very important that we create enough literature so that future generations, as well as our own, are able to sufficiently understand what is going on.</p><p>There is no better way to communicate social and historical events than literature. Because literature and art, in general, have the ability to connect with people on a very deep, personal level. </p><p>Please join this project today and help us reach our goal and make this book a reality, so that we can share this story with as many people as possible around the world.</p><div>
<p><strong>WHERE?</strong>: The essential core of the story takes place in Venezuela, some scenes happen or make reference to Norway, the United States (mainly Miami), Spain, Cuba and Colombia, and other South American countries.

The book will be distributed for FREE to libraries and cultural centers.</p>
<p><strong>WHEN?:</strong> The idea of the project was born in Venezuela, in 2014 Carolina started compiling information, at the end of 2016 Kévin became interested in the idea and proposed to be part of the project, convert the book in a novel and write it in French, at beginning of 2017 they started to work together, and today, finally the book is already written.

</div></div>","The book is a novel that tells the story of four families of different political ideologies and social classes in Venezuela during the Chávez government. Through the stories of these families, the reader sees how Chávez came to power, positioned himself and managed to control the masses. The story involves the reader in the idiosyncrasies of the Venezuelan population while showing the strengths and weaknesses of the Chavista leader and his environment of ambition, control and power. In this way, the reader realizes how the country with the largest oil reserves in the world, who was once the place with the happiest people on earth, is submerged today in a terrible crisis.""A novel created from real stories of real people who lived and made the history of Venezuela in the last two decades""This story is told from the point of view of families that genuinely experienced the struggles that the book describes. Speaking from the point of view of these families allowed the writers to create a story that is historically very accurate, but also very humane, raw and powerful. It allows the reader to capture the delicacy of the subtle moments in the life of the characters and also to feel the pain and understand the magnitude of the events that occurred. It's a very real and very intimate reading experience.CONCEPT:The book is divided into 3 chapters: I) Hope and Glory. II) Confrontation, Alliances and External Powers. III) Paranoia and Decadence. Three key stages of Chavism, between power, ambition, ingenuity, illusion, fantasy, black magic, witchcraft, appropriation, autocracy, destructuring, betrayal, frustration, gratitude, subsidies, obsession, and fortuitous disappearances.The name of the book is based on the popular expression: ""Better to be a Tail of a Lion than a Head of a Mouse"" or vice versa,  or vice versa, meaning that it is better to be at the tail of the larger ones, than at the head of the smallest. Here we have adopted both ends ""Head of a Lion and Tail of a mouse"", representing, on one hand, the great “head” that was Chávez, who managed to occupy the highest position in his country. Although he was not an intellectual, he had great mental capacity, was intelligent, diligent for his purposes and aware of his ability to manipulate. Through his leadership, Chávez promoted to stay in the memory of the people as a historical character in the scale of Simon Bolivar and Jesus Christ. The tail, on the other hand, represents all the dirty and hidden moves which he took in order to achieve Chavism’s goals.
The concept The concept is reflected in the illustration on the cover of the book: a large dark lion head, representing the leader and his circle, located on the left side, with his back to the right, or in accordance with Chávez, with his back to capitalism. On the right side, seen from the Chavist ideology as the negative side, is the tail, illustrating the connection from the highest position down to the last one of the line, and from capitalism to socialism, all connected and involved in the misfortune of the country.  ¿And you? ¿Do you want to be a Tail of a Lion or a Head of a Mouse? WHY?:  Our generation has the responsibility to deeply understand and leave a printed record for future generations about what's going on now in Venezuela and what has happened in the past two decades.It is very important that we create enough literature so that future generations, as well as our own, are able to sufficiently understand what is going on.There is no better way to communicate social and historical events than literature. Because literature and art, in general, have the ability to connect with people on a very deep, personal level. Please join this project today and help us reach our goal and make this book a reality, so that we can share this story with as many people as possible around the world.
WHERE?: The essential core of the story takes place in Venezuela, some scenes happen or make reference to Norway, the United States (mainly Miami), Spain, Cuba and Colombia, and other South American countries. The book has been written between Venezuela and France, it will be translated between Argentina and France, and it will be distributed in all the parts of the world that we can reach. The book will be distributed for FREE to libraries and cultural centers.
WHEN?: The idea of the project was born in Venezuela, in 2014 Carolina started compiling information, at the end of 2016 Kévin became interested in the idea and proposed to be part of the project, convert the book in a novel and write it in French, at beginning of 2017 they started to work together, and today, finally the book is already written. We just need to complete the fundraising phase in order to cover the costs of translation, reproduction, and distribution.

</div><div>
<p>Reading as a tool for education, is often guided by a core message or lesson. Every Girl provides an inclusive variety of messages and lessons delivered through anecdotal experiences. These stories gently deconstruct the more significant events of a child’s life and through this two main things will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of feeling as though they are experiencing the world in an individual and potentially isolating way, the reader will feel a part of a global community of children who encounter similar life experiences</li>
<li>Children will be encouraged to think about the world beyond their immediate surroundings. This in turn encourages compassion and empathy; key tools for inclusive and enriching social interactions, and ultimately a more peaceful world.</li>

<h3>Most Frequently Asked Question</h3>
<p><strong><i>Question : How do you find the women who tell their stories?</i></strong></p>
<p><i>Our website is the short answer. </i></p>
<p>The long answer is, women go online and fill in <a href=""https://www.iameverygirl.org/get-involved"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this form</a>. We then follow up with an interview. If the interview goes well, we write it into a children's story and include it into our archives. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge we faced in the very beginning, was getting great stories from so many countries.</p>
<p>We worried that once we found the relevant women, would they be able to recall great stories from their childhood? How would we get them to tell their story honestly and authentically? How would we make the stories honest and interesting?</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, we had to use the internet; social media to be specific; <strong>Hashtags</strong> have been key. For example #<strong>cameroonianwoman </strong>and<strong> #cameroonianqueen </strong>were both successful in helping us find two stories from Cameroon.</p>
<p>On our team is also  BBC correspondent Claire Read, who designed the framework we use to interview the women. Her work has been instrumental in helping us get the absolute best stories out of anyone and its not too often we walk away without a great story to tell! She's an absolute pro - <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/claire-read-4a136a55"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check her out! </a></p>
<p>We were also super lucky to get surges in interest after our media spotlights and write ups with NEXT and Bustle. Currently, we receive about 20 submissions of interest each week and only  require a handful of countries to make submissions (Tuvalu, North Korea and Papua New Guinea are of special interest at the moment). For women interested in being considered for the book, we encourage you to submit on our site! </p>

<h3>What are Probiotics?</h3>
<p>Probiotics are live bacterial cultures that we consume in fermented foods. They're called ""pro"" because they're believed to be beneficial to our health.</p>
<p>""Years of antibiotic use (either by prescription drugs or by eating conventionally-raised meats), eating sugar-laden food, and eschewing microbe-feeding fibers are all making you fat—but not for the reason you think. This pattern of drug use and poor eating has also armed the bad bacteria who live in your gut with the weapons they need to overtake the good guys. And when your good gut bugs are depleted, they not only won't be able to fend off weight-inducing inflammation, they also can't help you keep your metabolism humming, your immune system healthy, and your mind keen."" - Eat This, Not That!</p>
<p>By adding more probiotic foods into your diet, you could see all of the following health benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stronger immune system</li>
<li>Improved digestion</li>
<li>Increased energy from production of vitamin B12</li>
<li>Reduced cold and flu</li>
<li>Healing from leaky gut and inflammatory bowel disease</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
<li><p>Better breath because probiotics destroy candida</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Probiotic Health Related Children's Books</h3>
<p>We are creating Children's Books that discuss fermented probiotic foods such as Kefir, Kvass, and Sauerkraut. We believe that these are foods that should be a part of a regular healthy diet and that introducing healthy eating habits at an early age can establish a lifetime of wellness. </p>
<p>Our first Children's Board Book that we created is filled with probiotic terms to start familiarizing your toddler with. It covers Kefir, Kombucha, Kvass, Pickles, Sourdough, and Sauerkraut which has never been done before... till now.</p>
<p>Written by Carmela Cirilli founder and main Fermentista at The Cultured Club. She creates traditional fermented foods and offers private events and workshops.</p>
<p>The artwork and layout of the book was created by Tim Mattson. The illustrations were created using a minimal pop art styling along with colors that are sure to capture your child's attention. More importantly it will introduce fermented probiotic foods to your child.</p>

<h3>What is this doggo guide?</h3>
<p>In the US and UK combined, there are almost <strong>80,000,000 pet dogs. </strong>That's 320 million paws bounding around our homes and hearts.</p>
<p>It's a wonder then, that getting a new dog is still fraught with <i>so much confusion.</i> </p>
<p>How can it be that with this many dog owners,<strong> there's no single source of truth about how to raise your first doggo right?</strong></p>
<p>From the many myths and legends about what you should and shouldn’t do, to the insane amount of information online - it's impossible to know where to begin. Seriously. You need anti-acids to get through it. It's nerve-wracking.</p>
<p>When I finally got through that quagmire after getting my own first doggo, I decided enough was enough. So over several months, I wrote the guide that I wish I'd had.</p>
<p>The result is<strong> 100+ pages of simple, accessible, up-to-date information</strong> to get you off to <i>the best </i>start with your new pupper.</p>
<p>From deciding which breed to get, right through to the one year boosters, you'll have all the information you need to get through every major milestone, stress-free.</p>
<p>The chapters in the book follow your pup from before they are born, right through to their 2nd birthday. The aim is to walk you through all the stages of your dogs development as they happen, in real-time (something I <i>wish </i>I'd been able to access.)</p>
<h3><u><strong>I've written the guide. Now I need your help to bring it to life!</strong></u></h3>
<p><br/>I'm raising $3000 to design, brand and print an initial batch of my guide. By backing this campaign, you'll not only be making my dog Phoebe very happy (10 minutes of uninterrupted belly rubs for every $10 raised...), but you'll also be supporting first time dog owners everywhere. And that just makes you awesome.</p>
<p><strong>So 3...2....1....Go back the campaign now! </strong></p>

<h3>Why am I doing this?</h3>
<p>My name’s Dani, and in late 2017 I got my very first dog - Phoebe. She is a dachshund-shih tzu-lhasa apso cross, and the absolute centre of my universe.</p>
<p>When I got her, I thought it would be a walk in the park. I love dogs and have lots of experience with them, so surely having my own would be easy... right? </p>
<p>Wrong. </p>
<p>It was so much harder than I expected. For the first 4 months, I was sleep deprived and anxious all the time. And I realised that the root of that anxiety was that I really just couldn’t find a conclusive source of information to know what what was normal, and what wasn’t. The more I read, the more confused I got.</p>
<p>So one day, as I cycled to work, thinking about some element of Phoebe’s general health and wellbeing as per usual, I decided to create the guide I wish I’d had.</p>
<p>And so I did.</p>
<p>The result is 100+ pages of absolutely everything that I could think of that any first time dog owner would need to know. </p>
<p>My hope is that by reading this, you have the support you need to make the many decisions that face you over the first 12-24 months of your doggo's life.<br/><br/>I’ve purposefully left out medical related information from the guide - after all I’m not a vet and this guide should never substitute advice from a professional. But everything else in here should be a great point to help you navigate your way through this grand adventure.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523985859/vxtlnlblshtjxix9ukl4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Challenge #1: Getting the brand right</strong><br/>I've written this as a guide for millenials. I use words like doge, and pupper, and floof, because I was so sick and tired of reading material from the early 90s when I needed accessible information. But getting the visual brand right is a fine balance, so I will work with a branding specialist to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge #2: Publishing </strong><br/>Need I say more? Printing and distributing anything on a small-scale for a reasonable price is tough. Price breaks start to get real once your order numbers are up over 1000 copies; which is a frightening place to begin.</p>
<p>I plan to do an initial print run of 50 copies, which will help me to guage the appetite for physical books and to test out more scaleable models of printing. I can get each book printed for around $10-15, and with shipping on top, I will be able to comfortable get the first 50 printed within the $3000 target (after the design spend).</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We are an independent publishing house, based in Vienna, Austria specialising in high quality collector's issues on rock's biggest acts: Since 2009, we have published German language ""Rock Classics"" issues (journalistic projects of unofficial nature) about the likes of AC/DC, LED ZEPPELIN, PINK FLOYD, METALLICA, GUNS N' ROSES, KISS and QUEEN (and many more...). This QUEEN issue will be our first to be translated into English and fully updated to include additional original features, adding extra value and making this collector's issue available to fans worldwide for the first time. With the world in lockdown, the time is right to offer a bit of distraction and joy to music fans worldwide, and what better subject to lighten the mood, ease the mind, and enjoy the moment than QUEEN? Aside from this, you would be supporting independent music journalism and magazine publishing.</p>
<h3>A Brief Overview Of Content </h3>
<p>The magazine features the history, discography and biographies of the band, as well as film, book, memorabilia sections and special features. Several interviews and many rare photos are also included.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have decades of publishing experience in publishing magazines, so we expect the delivery in time, but unforeseen challenges or delays due to the ongoing Corona-crisis can not be totally ruled out, e.g., if postal service restrictions continue unexpectedly for a longer time period. Even then, delivery later than September 2020 is unlikely and your order is likely to arrive much earlier. Another minor issue is the fact that depending on the value of the goodie package you choose, you may be asked to pay import duty if you live outside the European Union. Import duty is highly unlikely to be imposed on a single magazine itself, however.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We would simply appreciate it if you spread the word, especially if you know some QUEEN fans or people who want to support independent music journalism. Any additional social media presence is extremely helpful, thank you!</p>

All parents want to share our sense of the world with our children, and instill in them a love for those things that we love, ourselves. And what do I love? To read and to travel! To learn about other cultures, about the history of far-off lands, and to make new friends.</p><p>My life is closely tied to Central Asia. I was born and spent my childhood in a small Uighur town on the border between Kazakhstan and China. My early years were much like Barzu’s - many women there baked bread in special clay ovens, called tanoors; my sister and I played with real clay from the ground and not plasticine; donkeys grazed through the streets; and fruits and berries ripened on the trees in our and our neighbors’ yards. Much later, after I had received my graduate degree, I spent a year in Tajikistan and that country, with its magnificent mountains and welcoming culture, has stayed in my heart ever since. I gained many good friends there, who remain so to this day.</p><p>I was surprised to find that there are very few books for children on Central Asia, in particular for pre-school children. After all, Central Asia is a region with over 100 ethnic groups, the land of the Great Silk Road, where Alexander the Great left his footprints, the old empires of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500491604/dbn4fqnyw9epg8wr6b0g.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>One day some time ago, my husband brought several souvenir mugs back from a business trip to Tajikistan, which were decorated with illustrations by our friend, the artist Farrukh Negmatzade. The images on the mugs were so compelling that I immediately began to imagine stories for each of them, which I told to my children. Thus, was born the idea to create a series of books about the Tajik boy, Barzu. My hope is that, through these books, young readers will become familiar not just with the culture of the Tajik people, but gradually learn about many other nationalities from Central Asia.</p><p>I have been working for the past year on this rather unique book. During this time, I barraged my friends in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan with hundreds of questions, corresponded with experts and historians, flew to the region in person and personally visited tanoor workshops, and read through a lot of historical and ethnographic literature.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500491669/ki5jvghsnaqezt1qut1d.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>And, of course, I consider it a privilege that, despite all the demands on his time, the great Farrukh-Aka (Uncle Farrukh) agreed to illustrate this book!  Who else could portray all the charm of Tajik life with such poignancy and detail, except an artist living and breathing his native, Tajik land? </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500491542/qcnbisdgql7gc6kttxma.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Irina from Boston, mother of two boys Petya (age 6) and Misha (age 4)</strong></p><p><i>My kids love to look in detail at the pictures and match them with the story and ask questions. We all liked the book. We had to find Tajikistan on the globe. The kids were fascinated with the new words like ""tanoor"" and ""kishlak,"" and names of people that do not sound like what they are used to. They were curious about tanoor, the peculiar way it looks and the way the dough is placed inside of it to make bread. The big hit was the chapter “Orange Roofs.” My boys were surprised to learn that people dry apricots on the roof under the sun and that they turn into ""kuraga"" which I often pack for them as a snack. They also liked the way Barzu solved the problem for the girls who did not know how to share the strings.</i></p><p><i>As a parent I appreciated many opportunities to expand beyond the story. Like trying to find the country on the map. Telling about the different lifestyle people have. When they have to be more self reliant and closer to nature, like making ovens and baking bread from scratch. It is a big difference with our hectic lives and frozen food from supermarket. We spread dried apricots on the table and imagined the orange roofs of the houses in kishlak.</i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500491840/mx8gkpim4lnwy3j0ogxd.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p><p><strong>Natalia Mironova, currently lives in California</strong></p><p><i>The story flows like an oriental pattern.

We enter the wonderful world of a clever Tajik boy, hardworking and curious, who travels by bicycle to his grandmother. Together with him we discover his grandmother's secrets and the eternal wisdom of Central Asian life and folklore. This is a very good book.

""A long, long time ago, in a place where great roads crossed, stood the City of Blue Domes. The city was full of narrow, winding streets and intricate mosaics on the walls of its high towers. Many different kinds of people lived there - traders and craftsmen, musicians and dancers, the rich and the poor - and everyone spoke two or three languages so they could understand one another and live together in peace and harmony.The city was famous for its bazaars – marketplaces, where everybody sold and bought goods. Oh, and what you could not find there, among the stalls! Sweet and juicy fruits, crisp vegetables, clay pots, expensive jewelry, boots, the finest, dyed silks, handmade carpets, rare books – everything your heart could desire!""""And so, one day a merchant named Fayeez departed with his caravan to far-off Hindustan, the land of rich maharajas, from where he always brought spices and medicines, pearls, precious stones and fabulous fabrics. For several months he would travel overland, trudging through the deserts and hills with his caravan of camels, his faithful helpers, and brave horsemen. Arriving in the City of the Sun, in the land of Marwar, Fayeez immediately went to the fortress, which towered over a high cliff of red rock, and where the local ruler, maharaja Sardar, was always ready to welcome merchants.""Children 3 - 12 years old. My goal has been to make this book interesting and understandable not only for children of all ages, but also for their parents. Thus, the book is divided into several parts: the story itself, which includes history and fable; folkloric narrative on how people really live; and an educational section at the end of the story for parents to discuss with their children.""The servants opened the chest and withdrew from it round loaves of bread that Fayeez brought from the City of Blue Domes. Over the six months that they sat in the chest, their crusts had become stale and hard.Taking them into his hands, the maharaja roared with displeasure: “What is this? What are these rocks you have brought me, Merchant Fayeez?”“This is bread from my city,” said Fayeez with pride. “There is no such bread anywhere in the world!”“Are you playing a trick on me?!” the Maharaja growled, his brow knit in anger. “On such bread as this you would have me break my teeth!”“Do not be angry, your Highness. For these are loaves of the most unusual bread.”The main incentive for creating this book was the birth of my children. All parents want to share our sense of the world with our children, and instill in them a love for those things that we love, ourselves. And what do I love? To read and to travel! To learn about other cultures, about the history of far-off lands, and to make new friends.My life is closely tied to Central Asia. I was born and spent my childhood in a small Uighur town on the border between Kazakhstan and China. My early years were much like Barzu’s - many women there baked bread in special clay ovens, called tanoors; my sister and I played with real clay from the ground and not plasticine; donkeys grazed through the streets; and fruits and berries ripened on the trees in our and our neighbors’ yards. Much later, after I had received my graduate degree, I spent a year in Tajikistan and that country, with its magnificent mountains and welcoming culture, has stayed in my heart ever since. I gained many good friends there, who remain so to this day.I was surprised to find that there are very few books for children on Central Asia, in particular for pre-school children. After all, Central Asia is a region with over 100 ethnic groups, the land of the Great Silk Road, where Alexander the Great left his footprints, the old empires of Genghis Khan and Tamerlane!One day some time ago, my husband brought several souvenir mugs back from a business trip to Tajikistan, which were decorated with illustrations by our friend, the artist Farrukh Negmatzade. The images on the mugs were so compelling that I immediately began to imagine stories for each of them, which I told to my children. Thus, was born the idea to create a series of books about the Tajik boy, Barzu. My hope is that, through these books, young readers will become familiar not just with the culture of the Tajik people, but gradually learn about many other nationalities from Central Asia.I have been working for the past year on this rather unique book. During this time, I barraged my friends in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan with hundreds of questions, corresponded with experts and historians, flew to the region in person and personally visited tanoor workshops, and read through a lot of historical and ethnographic literature.And, of course, I consider it a privilege that, despite all the demands on his time, the great Farrukh-Aka (Uncle Farrukh) agreed to illustrate this book!  Who else could portray all the charm of Tajik life with such poignancy and detail, except an artist living and breathing his native, Tajik land? Irina from Boston, mother of two boys Petya (age 6) and Misha (age 4)My kids love to look in detail at the pictures and match them with the story and ask questions. We all liked the book. We had to find Tajikistan on the globe. The kids were fascinated with the new words like ""tanoor"" and ""kishlak,"" and names of people that do not sound like what they are used to. They were curious about tanoor, the peculiar way it looks and the way the dough is placed inside of it to make bread. The big hit was the chapter “Orange Roofs.” My boys were surprised to learn that people dry apricots on the roof under the sun and that they turn into ""kuraga"" which I often pack for them as a snack. They also liked the way Barzu solved the problem for the girls who did not know how to share the strings.As a parent I appreciated many opportunities to expand beyond the story. Like trying to find the country on the map. Telling about the different lifestyle people have. When they have to be more self reliant and closer to nature, like making ovens and baking bread from scratch. It is a big difference with our hectic lives and frozen food from supermarket. We spread dried apricots on the table and imagined the orange roofs of the houses in kishlak.Natalia Mironova, currently lives in CaliforniaThe story flows like an oriental pattern. Very simple language creates vivid and memorable images of mountains, the blue sky, ancient traditions, an old sun-lit city with roofs covered by orange apricots. We enter the wonderful world of a clever Tajik boy, hardworking and curious, who travels by bicycle to his grandmother. Together with him we discover his grandmother's secrets and the eternal wisdom of Central Asian life and folklore. This is a very good book. As the grandmother of three grandchildren, I am glad of this book’s appearance and, undoubtedly, the emergence of a new author.Marina Abrams – Author of “Orange and Blue: The World of Barzu” and the pending book series,The World of Barzu; project director and founder of “Barzu World.” I was born and raised in Kazakhstan.

A partir del 15 de Enero del año 2015, y gracias al apoyo de la Super Intendencia de Industria y Comercio, empece a cristalizar mi ambición, al recibir mi primera patente de invención, bajo la <a href=""http://serviciospub.sic.gov.co/~oparra/serv_57/externas/DetallePatente.php?consultando=patentescolombianas&amp;parametros=opparametros&amp;vano=13&amp;vtra=2&amp;vnum=56386&amp;vcon=%20%20&amp;vcons=0&amp;vcre=50690&amp;vtem=IQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">resolucion 610 de la SIC</a>.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Con esta idea patentada, me dedique a proyectar su aplicacion real en el mundo, y el proyecto que resulto gracias a la colaboracion de innumerables personas y organizaciones comprometidas unas con el medioambiente y otras con el desarrollo social, responde a un problema urgente que tenemos en nuestra ciudad, y que se presenta en casi cualquier ciudad o región moderna que este densamente poblada, que es la disposición final de las llantas usadas, ya sea de vehiculos domesticos, de vehiculos comerciales o las especiales usadas en agricultura, aviacion o mineria.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lamentablemente, en Bogotá el problema es tan grave, que ya se han producido incendios de grandes magnitudes debido al <a href=""http://www.eltiempo.com/bogota/incendio-en-fontibon/14789439"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">manejo inadecuado de los residuos</a> por parte de una empresa que se comprometio y no cumplio, causando ademas de la emergencia ambiental un rechazo por parte de cualquier organizacion a tomar cartas en el asunto, para evitar responsabilidades dificiles de asumir. El resultado es que ahora <a href=""http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/CMS-14594218"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">las llantas se acumulan</a> en esquinas, andenes, canales y demas zonas comunes de la ciudad, porque es prohibida su disposicion final en rellenos sanitarios.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1366597/files/20150408142256-DSCN8487.JPG?1428528176"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">La solución hasta ahora la han aportado empresas privadas, ofreciendo soluciones de triturado de caucho, el cual es normalmente utilizado en proyectos arquitectónicos. Por ley, cada obra de pavimentación nueva debe incluir un 20% de triturado recuperado de llantas por volumen mezclado con el asfalto. El problema, es que el mercado local se acerca a la saturacion, y las exportaciones no son suficientes para que la demanda por estos productos triturados se equilibre con el exceso de oferta de las llantas en desuso.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Aquí entro yo, ofreciendo una nueva solución que complementara el mercado, y ampliara la mezcla de ofertas tanto de fuentes de energia, como de opciones de reciclado o reutilizacion y disposicion final de residuos solidos especiales y/o pleigrosos.

A partir del 15 de Enero del año 2015, y gracias al apoyo de la Super Intendencia de Industria y Comercio, empece a cristalizar mi ambición, al recibir mi primera patente de invención, bajo la resolucion 610 de la SIC.Con esta idea patentada, me dedique a proyectar su aplicacion real en el mundo, y el proyecto que resulto gracias a la colaboracion de innumerables personas y organizaciones comprometidas unas con el medioambiente y otras con el desarrollo social, responde a un problema urgente que tenemos en nuestra ciudad, y que se presenta en casi cualquier ciudad o región moderna que este densamente poblada, que es la disposición final de las llantas usadas, ya sea de vehiculos domesticos, de vehiculos comerciales o las especiales usadas en agricultura, aviacion o mineria.Lamentablemente, en Bogotá el problema es tan grave, que ya se han producido incendios de grandes magnitudes debido al manejo inadecuado de los residuos por parte de una empresa que se comprometio y no cumplio, causando ademas de la emergencia ambiental un rechazo por parte de cualquier organizacion a tomar cartas en el asunto, para evitar responsabilidades dificiles de asumir. El resultado es que ahora las llantas se acumulan en esquinas, andenes, canales y demas zonas comunes de la ciudad, porque es prohibida su disposicion final en rellenos sanitarios.La solución hasta ahora la han aportado empresas privadas, ofreciendo soluciones de triturado de caucho, el cual es normalmente utilizado en proyectos arquitectónicos. Por ley, cada obra de pavimentación nueva debe incluir un 20% de triturado recuperado de llantas por volumen mezclado con el asfalto. El problema, es que el mercado local se acerca a la saturacion, y las exportaciones no son suficientes para que la demanda por estos productos triturados se equilibre con el exceso de oferta de las llantas en desuso.Aquí entro yo, ofreciendo una nueva solución que complementara el mercado, y ampliara la mezcla de ofertas tanto de fuentes de energia, como de opciones de reciclado o reutilizacion y disposicion final de residuos solidos especiales y/o pleigrosos. Al ofrecer una opción valida a los generadores, usuarios y monta-llantas, es posible comprometer a los demás protagonistas en esta problemática, para que integren las cadenas de gestión del distrito. Esta solución no se enfrenta a saturacion del mercado, ya que el principal producto en oferta es energia electrica, que en una economia en desarrollo, siempre esta en alta demanda.Por medio del proceso realizado en los reactores patentados, se descompone la estructura quimica de las llantas usadas y es transformada en un combustible gaseoso que es de inmediato transformado en energia electrica, por medio de avanzados equipos comerciales de generacion de potencia, desarrollados por un reconocido fabricante a nivel mundial; De este proceso se generan subproductos de carbono en estado solido, que son procesados para ser puestos en el mercado como materia prima para la industria.Ahora es el momento de hacer grandes cosas con la ayuda de todos! Esta campaña me va a permitir construir los prototipos, la planta piloto y realizar la primera implementacion de un proyecto Waste-To-Power; Por eso, esta campaña se debe desarrollar en tres etapas, y contando con el apoyo tecnico y el financiamiento ofrecido por el proveedor, al final de la tercera etapa debemos haber logrado encontrar tantos colaboradores y tan comprometidos, que podamos hacer realidad esta empresa.Etapa I - Reactor PANCHA V3Hace décadas existe el concepto de pirolisis y es ampliamente utilizado sobretodo en la industria alimenticia; Varias empresas intentaron proponer modelos productivos empleando la pirolisis para obtener energéticos y materias primas a partir de materiales vulcanizados, específicamente llantas usadas, durante la década de los 70’s sin mayor éxito.  Actualmente, el grave problema social y ambiental que supone la disposición final de llantas ha renovado el interés de un pequeño sector de la industria en este nicho de mercado, y fabricantes Chinos se pusieron a la labor de resucitar antiguos diseños Japoneses caídos en abandono o cuyas patentes expiraron, para ofrecer plantas integrales para la pirolisis que aunque relativamente funcionales, son absolutamente obsoletas.Este diseño se aprovecha de las particularidades físicas de la materia prima, específicamente su capacidad de absorber energía radiante o índice de emisividad; Utilizamos energía radiante infrarroja para inteligentemente bombardear las moléculas de hidro-carbones presentes en las llantas desechadas y precipitar el proceso de pirolisis en mucho menor tiempo, con un manejo inteligente y eficiente de la energía, completamente eléctrico, sin combustión de energéticos fósiles o del gas sintético obtenido. Los reactores diseñados por nosotros no requieren de cámara de pre-combustión, blowers, etc. Su aislamiento refractario es liviano, pues aprovechando la diferencia en emisividad entre la materia prima y el contenedor de la cámara de reacción se minimizan las fugas de energía térmica por conducción y/o convección.De construcción liviana, y sin partes internas móviles, también ofrece flexibilidad superior frente a los diseños tradicionales, pues puede operar en atmósfera negativa o positiva, con diferentes medios oxidantes o inertes, permite la inyección de vapor para inducir perfiles de extrusión en moléculas de carbón activado, etc.He construido un prototipo a escala de la última revisión de diseño (PANCHA3) y realizado pruebas de operación simples que demuestran la aplicación práctica del concepto.Cada reactor o gasificador PANCHA3 tiene un consumo eléctrico de 18KWh, el planteamiento es modular, cada unidad procesa independientemente una tonelada de materia prima y pueden combinarse cuantas unidades se requieran. Actualmente el diseño de los reactores PANCHA3 y de la planta PIARS, así como los procedimientos de operación asociados a esta tecnología de pirolisis por medio de energía radiante IR cuentan con protección de la propiedad intelectual bajo la modalidad de patente de invención, bajo la jurisdicción de la SIC en Colombia y modelo PCT Internacional, con referencia Resolución 610 del 15 de Enero de 2015. Etapa II - Planta piloto, BalsillasAdelantándome al éxito por alcanzar en la primera etapa, quiero mencionar las principales características en cada una de las siguientes etapas; La construcción de la planta piloto para la recepción y disposición final de residuos sólidos especiales y/o peligrosos esta enmarcada dentro de las siguientes características:Ubicación geográfica: Balsillas - Zabrizky, Cundinamarca, Colombia.

Localizada en una zona de alto impacto, con uso industrial permitido, y otras empresas dedicadas a la disposición final en el sector, así como los rellenos sanitarios de Mondoñedo, esta ubicación es ideal para la construcción de nuestra planta piloto de tratamiento de residuos y generación/distribución eléctrica.
La construcción de líneas adicionales de 500KV como Bacata – Ancon sur y la reconfiguración de líneas como  Bacata – Mosquera o Mosquera – Nueva Esperanza asegura una infraestructura solida que facilite la comercialización y distribución de la energía producida.
La importancia de los planes de ampliación del Sistema de Transmisión Nacional está relacionada fuertemente con compromisos a largo plazo que el país ha adquirido por medio de acuerdos internacionales, y responde también a la agenda de impulso y desarrollo del gobierno nacional, por lo que se espera estabilidad y apoyo intersectorial que favorezca la implementación a larga escala y a largo plazo de estas soluciones, además de un gran potencial de replicar en diferentes mercados el impacto obtenido.

<p>My name is Jerryl (<b>Owner</b>), I live in the Philippines with my American husband and our 2 year old daughter. Life here is very hard and many like myself have found that earning online is often better than earning outside of your home. This is something my husband and I are very passionate about. We have a Facebook following of over 80,000 Filipinos over our 4yr period online. The reason we have that following is due to years of helping people earn online via online sales, coaching of good customer relations as well as marketing approaches.</p>
<p>This is our opportunity to take it to a higher level to not only give to the people of our country, but also to the world, while of course creating some stability for our family.<br/></p>
<p>I myself have been a blogger on numerous sites that were ""revenue share"". Some sites are like carbon copies of each other which is one thing that will be drastically different about mine. The other issue is that some sites rushed in and had not figured out their payment algorithms nor how to best send funds to members globally. This in turn creates a lot of problems for them. We have all these issues sorted out. All we need now is to be able to fund it.<br/></p>

<b>Blog Money Mafia’s</b> intent is to 
have a fun theme, to make this entertaining with fun related avatars as 
well as Mafia profile names (<i>Ex - Tommy No Thumbs</i>) and to basically think outside the box.  We do not
 have any affiliation with anything mafia related nor do we condone 
violence or illegal activity.  Participating in this themed site is in 
our opinion similar to watching a mafia movie or playing a bank robbers 
video game, it is merely entertainment.  If you do not feel comfortable 
with the name of the site or the use of the word “<i>Mafia</i>” we certainly

<b>What makes this Social Blogging Network different?</b><br/>
A Treasure Chest of features!<br/>
We
 tend to be way out there when we do things, we look at what has worked 
well for some and what is lacking in other areas. A Social Blogging Site
 is like a combo (<i>or should be</i>) of articles, interaction between members
 and staff as well as <b>FUN</b>! (<i>Unlike many generic looking sites we see 
that don’t stand out at all</i>). We have many ideas for the site such as 
games, chatroom, groups, contests, emoticons, online or offline status, 
favorite’s lists, readers rating articles to encourage improvement or to
 validate their worth. Along with the Mafia theme itself which makes you feel like you are a character in a movie.<br/><br/>
<div>
<b>WHAT WE NEED:</b><br/>
We are asking for a contribution of <b>$3,000.00</b> US. We are fortunate 
enough to have a developer who is also a friend who worked with HP for 
15yrs who has all the skills to do this. He also lives in the 
Philippines and between the friendship and the cost of living here he 
has given us this bargain price.<br/>
What the money will be used for is very easily broken down into 2 parts.<br/>
1. Approximately <b>$2000.00</b> for the site development and programming.<br/>
2. Approximately<b> $1,000.00</b> for Business license, tax ID registration 
as well as the opening of a business bank account which requires at 
least $1000.00 to open.<br/>
Any additional costs if $3,000.00 is not enough should be small enough for us to cover.<br/>
<br/>
<b>WHATS IN IT FOR YOU? </b><br/>
Double Return Payback or<br/>
1 Year FREE Advertising Banner Ad (Approx. $1,200 value) with $100+ donation.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Blog Money Mafia</b> site has no products to offer anyone so options 
to give back are limited to offering one year free advertising space 
(Approx. $1,200 value) with $100+ donation.<br/>
<br/>
OR. A double your money return on your donation. I would happily draw up
 a receipt detailing what has been donated as well as what will be 
returned to you. The return payment would happen on a monthly basis as 
that is how advertisers pay the site and how the site pays the members. 
If you donate $5, you will be paid back $10 If you donate $1000, you 
will be paid back $2000.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank your for reading this and your time. This is truly one of 
the most humbling things to ask for help, a position I hate being in but
 we really want to see this happen not only for us but for the 1,000+ 
members waiting for this to begin.<br/>

My name is Jerryl (Owner), I live in the Philippines with my American husband and our 2 year old daughter. Life here is very hard and many like myself have found that earning online is often better than earning outside of your home. This is something my husband and I are very passionate about. We have a Facebook following of over 80,000 Filipinos over our 4yr period online. The reason we have that following is due to years of helping people earn online via online sales, coaching of good customer relations as well as marketing approaches.
This is our opportunity to take it to a higher level to not only give to the people of our country, but also to the world, while of course creating some stability for our family.
I myself have been a blogger on numerous sites that were ""revenue share"". Some sites are like carbon copies of each other which is one thing that will be drastically different about mine. The other issue is that some sites rushed in and had not figured out their payment algorithms nor how to best send funds to members globally. This in turn creates a lot of problems for them. We have all these issues sorted out. All we need now is to be able to fund it.
MY HUSBAND IS RUNNING THE PROJECT: SOME WORDS FROM HIM:

Blog Money Mafia is a project we have basically been sitting on 
for over a year now due to financial difficulties. It is not that the 
site being created is so overly expensive. More a matter of me being an 
American in the Philippines who is not a retiree and doesn't have SSS 
with a wife a baby is a very hard position to be in when it comes to 
making a living here that can support all of us.



The site has already been started but we have a long way to go. Right 
now we have a mock up of the landing page, there are still many 
additions to do here alone.











What is Blog Money Mafia? This is a social blog network where 
members of the site write articles that interest them, whether it is 
about their life, their beliefs, the news, entertainment... nearly 
anything you can think of. The traffic that activity creates earns 
revenue for the site via ads on the site. 50% of that revenue will be shared with  members.

<p>There’s
never been a media disaster bigger than this; there’s also never been a more perfect
one.</p>
<p>When
you’re Oscar royalty, you never dream of fame and fortune being a fabrication.
Nineteen year-old Olivia Ashbury would bet hard cash on that, until the night
she realized she was starring in the biggest government block buster to hit the
New York Times: her life. Or at least her illusion of it.  </p>
<p><b>You
may not remember her, but you know her all too well. </b>Before, Olivia Ashbury’s
name resonated globally through your YouTube pages, demolished primetime
television and polished itself beside high-priced brands: until the unthinkable
happened. Now it’s <b><i>your turn</i> </b>to access
the gated communities, live like an Idol and hold the behind the scenes
information on the scandals Perez Hilton can’t attain and the Illuminati covered up. It’s with this series of memoirs that Olivia will begin to tell her journey
from stardom to the downfall that leads her to question the throne on which she
rules. Everyone’s favorite Barbie Bitch may be a piece of art, but the ugliness
coiling inside of her will burn her Angel wings and <i>Ignite</i> the true nightmare within. Who ever said heroines were pure? </p>

Born and raised in Canada’s North Hollywood, at only nineteen years-old the actress and YouTuber is adding author to her belt as she singlehandedly builds an empire around the biggest celebrity in history, one who’s reportedly hired her to write, produce and deliver her memoirs to the masses. And despite her age, Kaitlyn’s a dark horse in an ancient market. With youth, insight and indestructible fearlessness on her side, she’s established to bring a new revolution to the book industry that the monopolized publishing houses have snubbed. Taking her acting, directing and storytelling chops to the board, she’s designed a marketing genius that only a girl partnered with a Hollywood Idol could pull off. But according to her, life’s not all glamour and pretty lies. She’s not quick to sensor raw truth and even slower to dismiss the ones who’ve done her wrong when commercializing Olivia’s story. The tables are being turned. And as scripture says, Karma’s a bitch. Thankfully, she’s an even bigger one. Because if you learn anything from her, you’ll know this isn’t a sob story.</span></p>

you’re Oscar royalty, you never dream of fame and fortune being a fabrication.
Nineteen year-old Olivia Ashbury would bet hard cash on that, until the night
she realized she was starring in the biggest government block buster to hit the
New York Times: her life. Or at least her illusion of it.  
You
may not remember her, but you know her all too well. Before, Olivia Ashbury’s
name resonated globally through your YouTube pages, demolished primetime
television and polished itself beside high-priced brands: until the unthinkable
happened. Now it’s your turn to access
the gated communities, live like an Idol and hold the behind the scenes
information on the scandals Perez Hilton can’t attain and the Illuminati covered up. It’s with this series of memoirs that Olivia will begin to tell her journey
from stardom to the downfall that leads her to question the throne on which she
rules. Everyone’s favorite Barbie Bitch may be a piece of art, but the ugliness
coiling inside of her will burn her Angel wings and Ignite the true nightmare within. Who ever said heroines were pure?

*PLEASE NOTE: By contributing to this campaign you'll be unveiling the truth behind the lies that the Illuminati's covered up for centuries. Olivia Ashbury is ready to tell her story, and she won't take ""no"" for an answer. 
 


MEET THE GIRL BEHIND THE STORY:





Kaitlyn Malone is the girl behind the story. Born and raised in Canada’s North Hollywood, at only nineteen years-old the actress and YouTuber is adding author to her belt as she singlehandedly builds an empire around the biggest celebrity in history, one who’s reportedly hired her to write, produce and deliver her memoirs to the masses. And despite her age, Kaitlyn’s a dark horse in an ancient market. With youth, insight and indestructible fearlessness on her side, she’s established to bring a new revolution to the book industry that the monopolized publishing houses have snubbed. Taking her acting, directing and storytelling chops to the board, she’s designed a marketing genius that only a girl partnered with a Hollywood Idol could pull off. But according to her, life’s not all glamour and pretty lies. She’s not quick to sensor raw truth and even slower to dismiss the ones who’ve done her wrong when commercializing Olivia’s story. The tables are being turned. And as scripture says, Karma’s a bitch. Thankfully, she’s an even bigger one. Because if you learn anything from her, you’ll know this isn’t a sob story.


BREAKING ALL THE RULES:
My goal with this series is to revolutionize the book industry like never before. Gone are the days of lining up to watch an author sign your book before being dismissed. I'm ready to merge the worlds of YouTube and acting into the page turners that transform our wildest dreams. In doing so I plan on not only plastering the world with Olivia's image and story but collaborating with your favorite YouTubers and creating a theatrical book signing that will leave you on the edge of your seats. What else would you expect when teaming up with the one and only Olivia Ashbury? We're ready to Ignite your imaginations and light up your world like never before. I'm prepared to create the ultimate fan experience through videos, giveaways, personal appearances and more.  BLOOD, SWEAT & GLITTER:{Or} MAIN GOALS:We want everyone to get their hands on a copy. The goal for IGNITED is to not only deliver a unique paperback and special edition hardcover, but for IGNITED to be available in multiple locations and formats such as eBooks on Amazon and audio editions on Audible. As of now our primary focus is on Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom (Australia is also in the running). We're also aiming to have IGNITED sold in-store at retail locations such as Chapters Indigo and Barns & Noble. 
Lights. Cameras. ACTION! the Olivia Ashbury memoirs campaign is a visual experience. This means we plan of creating dramatic mini commercial ads featuring known songs and starring Kaitlyn Malone, as well as your  favorite YouTubers (NAMES SOON TO BE ANNOUNCED!!!). The content will be posted on Kaitlyn Malone's YouTube channel with high potential to be featured on various collaborated channels. *FUTURE GOALS: Book signings may be at the end of the red campaign carpet but this revolution didn't stop at the silver screen. Kaitlyn Malone has developed the ultimate signing experience that merges a classic book signing with a theatrical event. An elaborate stage, fancy dresses, and bringing Olivia's story beyond the pages into the real world by acting as her PR and co-author to reveal the truth behind the tabloids. There will be glitz, glamour, Q&A's, readings, and all of the inside scoop on Olivia Ashbury that you could dream of! 
the Olivia Ashbury memoirs is also a social experience to merge YouTubers, Instagramers, Tumblrs, Viners, & more to develop the ultimate fan experience through video content, collaborations... And it gets better:
My first act in #IGNITED2015 was to allow Instagrammers I've followed for years (and new discoveries) to produce pictures for the series. Meet @jillianlee_x, who won my Instagram #IGNITEDCOVERCONTEST to produce promotional content for the Olivia Ashbury memoirs. Her photography and style is impeccable, and the fact that she's so excited to collaborate on IGNITED earns her status next to Olivia herself. Make sure to check out her photography on Instagram & start following her ASAP!   GIRLS JUST WANT TO HAVE FUNDS: The 25K breakdown:

Advertising - $5,000
Initial Special Events/Signing Expenses - $4,000
Perk Rewards - $5,000

THE DEVIL'S IN THE PERKS:

You'll get your hands on brand new merchandise inspired by Olivia Ashbury herself that may include: DATE HIM & DIE, Thank the Prada Gods, NOT A SOB STORY, Not all heroines are pure, and MEDIA DISASTER. · A select few can score an exclusive interview with Kaitlyn Malone herself on Skype! Ask her anything and everything. 
· Collaborations with your favorite stars will mean even better perks for Olivians. VIPs will score social media follows from Kaitlyn Malone and at least one collaborator!

IN THE CASE WE DON'T HIT $25, 000... 
There's always a likelihood of an unsuccessful campaign, and in that case certain aspects will have to be sacrificed to contribute to publication. Sacrifices will include travelling for appearances and extensive advertising, meaning the perks that accompany such expenses will be delayed. How are we going to solve that problem? By having everyone posting #IGNITED2015 to spreading the word; spamming your favorite YouTubers, celebrities and talk show hosts.   JOIN THE ULTIMATE FANDOM: By contributing to the Olivia Ashbury memoirs you'll be not only be helping to distribute the story of a lifetime for the #Queen herself but standing up for #TEAMINTERNET and for the people who want to push boundaries or be ultraviolet in a cookie cutter industry. You'll also be gaining exclusive insight and access to the biggest media disaster to hit the New York Times before anyone else! So let's be like the cool kids and dress up like hipsters while making fun of our exes.
    HATERS & DARK HORSES:
Haters gonna hate. And I'm ready to face the facts when it comes to the tyrants ready to knock down the empire Olivia's trying to rebuild with scandal and doubt. Over the years I've built a thick skin thanks to personal experience, acting and YouTube, meaning harsh reviews or the rough cuts in editing don't faze me anymore. Not everyone will be your friend, either, so I've learned to stick with what I know best and use it to my best advantage, whether that be with contacts or $$$. Every penny will count and every person involved in the process will be specially chosen for their unique contributions to the Olivia Ashbury memoirs. My goal is to involve as many people as I can on social media to not only spread the word for IGNITED but #TEAMINTERNET. It's time to break the rules. 
    Other Ways You Can Help? Not everyone can afford a $3, 000 pair of Christian Louboutins but hashtagging #IGNITED2015 and #NOTASOBSTORY on every social media platform to hold your name is FREE. Make sure to spread Olivia's story and get it trending world wide! Let all of your celebrity Idols know about their BFF's new memoir. It's a luxury to tag her name, so take advantage of it.

Do you want to help Greece share its wonderful literature? Curious about new Russian writing?Fantastic! Just message our Campaign Team Leader, identifying a particular culture from anywhere in the Council of Europe countries when you make your donation, and we'll make sure it gets earmarked with the relevant series -- and that you are thanked on our radio as a supporter of that show!Trafika Europe Radio is a new piece of cultural infrastructure we can all enjoyThis is a great chance for a fresh-page approach to European cultures, to celebrate the diversity and get to know so many cultures a little better, with the best they have to offer, in English translation.


Trafika Europe seeks . . .








. . . to find and attract to what is new and
excellent in European literature;


. . . to create greater community for Europe
through our online radio;


. . . to support literary translation and increase mutual regard among cultures;


. . . to promote new voices and help writers get publishing
contracts in English;


. . . to partner with existing literary projects, media, and
programs, to honor, connect, and promote their efforts;


. . . to explore issues of belonging in Europe, such as migration
and race, toward building more united and caring communities, overcoming
divides of class, religion, nationality and ethnicity, and


. . . to be a bridge between traditional and online
publishing, explore innovative approaches, and build enthusiasm for European
literature among a new generation online.


Now
more than ever, such efforts are sorely needed, if we want to maintain a spirit
of belonging together and keep cultures open and growing together across the continent of Europe. Doing this by attracting hearts and minds together through culture is the easiest way. It's a
shared effort we can all support – but not a difficult one! It’s a joy to support literature in
this way, and we hope to attract widest participation with this radio project.




Trafika Europe was pleased to have served as a media partner with the New Literature from Europe festival in New York City in December. You can find some great audio interviews we made there, with participating European authors and with the publisher of New Directions.



We want to connect people through culture. Can you help us?

The same night, two young men from our neighborhood were taken into custody for questioning and, as we understand, were held for approximately 30 hours, until they gave the name of the alleged murderer. My son, Andre, was named by these young men mentioned, even though he absolutely did not commit this crime. I took Andre in for questioning, per the advisement of Chicago police officers. I never thought that he would be charged with first degree murder in June, 2006.</p><p>Andre’s trial started on November 13, 2007. My 19-year old son at that time was found guilty of murder with no physical evidence being presented by the state’s attorney. Again, there was no physical evidence to support this conviction.   I had never seen such an injustice. The system failed my son tremendously. The state presented two witnesses, one who recanted his earlier statement implicating my son and another who made numerous conflicting and contradictory statements. The first witness, Mr. Anderson, told the jury that he had to tell the truth because he did not want an innocent person to go to jail for something he did not do. The second witness changed her initial statements and testimony that she gave to the police and the grand jury. Later on into the investigation it was discovered that two known drug dealers in the neighborhood paid her off to lie and say my son murdered this young man. This young lady was involved with my son’s father years ago and she still had a grudge against me. During the trail there was no evidence presented. There was no murder weapon, no finger prints, no blood or DNA, and nothing else which connected my son to the crime.</p><p>On the other hand, there were four witnesses that the defense (my son’s attorneys) presented to testify about my son's whereabouts at the time of the murder. The judge also did not allow us to present a 911 Emergency call in which someone else identified another man as the shooter. There was no evidence against my son.</p><p>I've always believed that a person was innocent until proven guilty and that a person cannot be convicted on non-concrete, invalid, and untrustworthy information. My son has not been proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but he has instead been the victim of a wrongful conviction within the legal system. The judge would not allow all of the defense’s evidence to be presented during the trial, and, as a result my son was unable to have the jury hear the provable, substantiated, undeniable facts that they needed to hear to render their decision.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are many innocent people in prison, and I do not want my son to be one of the casualties. He is innocent, and given the opportunity, it can be proven in a court of law with a fair and impartial judge and a jury that renders a decision based upon the evidence. My faith and belief is that justice will prevail. I refuse to let my son be one of the numerous victim of injustice. At the time my son was convicted of murder, not only did the state not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, there was no physical evidence to tie my son to the murder. They acknowledged that their own witnesses were liars, yet this is what sent my son to prison for 57 years. The trial was not conducted in a fair manner and the jury did not have the opportunity to make a decision based on all the evidence being presented to them.

<h3>What is  <a href=""http://bacalaoconspiracy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Bacalao Conspiracy</a>  Project?</h3>
<p>The Bacalao Conspiracy looks at the events preceding the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in an attempt to inform the discussion surrounding the voyage and its effect on world affairs. The last half of the fifteenth century is seen through the eyes of three remarkable women whose lives are intimately connected to Columbus, and whose influence on him and his decision to sail west has been ignored in the current debate. Susanna Fontanarossa, Phillippa Perestrella Moniz, and Beatriz Enrique De Arana (his mother, his wife, and his mistress) were from very different cultures, and very different places but they shared one singular condition. They loved, and were loved by one of the world’s most famous men.</p>
<p>The Bacalao Conspiracy also looks at a unique group of people from northern Spain and southern France, known as the Basque. This close-knit cabal of warrior-sailors and fishermen had been exploiting the world’s richest fishery off the coast of Newfoundland for more than a generation, and the increased focus of the day on reaching Asia by sailing west jeopardized the vast fortune being made from that endeavor.</p>
<p>As these women live their lives, we explore the turbulent transition from the Late Middle Ages to the Renaissance in such places as Genoa, Madeira, Lisbon, Bilbao, Bayonne, Cordoba, Seville, and Huelva. We see these places from street level. We smell their food cooking, the aromas of commerce and daily life. We taste the food, experience the conflict, and feel the excitement of a world on the edge of expansion: a world whose boundaries were exploding.</p>
<p>This is the story of how these women turned a travelling salesman, the son of a middle class weaver, into the Admiral of the Ocean Sea. It’s the story of how the Basques used these women, and a fish, to change everything.</p>
<h4>
<b>You already know how Christopher’s story ends. We have all known since grade school. <br/></b><b>Help me show the world how it began.</b>

</div></div>","What is  The Bacalao Conspiracy  Project?
The Bacalao Conspiracy looks at the events preceding the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in an attempt to inform the discussion surrounding the voyage and its effect on world affairs. The last half of the fifteenth century is seen through the eyes of three remarkable women whose lives are intimately connected to Columbus, and whose influence on him and his decision to sail west has been ignored in the current debate. Susanna Fontanarossa, Phillippa Perestrella Moniz, and Beatriz Enrique De Arana (his mother, his wife, and his mistress) were from very different cultures, and very different places but they shared one singular condition. They loved, and were loved by one of the world’s most famous men.
The Bacalao Conspiracy also looks at a unique group of people from northern Spain and southern France, known as the Basque. This close-knit cabal of warrior-sailors and fishermen had been exploiting the world’s richest fishery off the coast of Newfoundland for more than a generation, and the increased focus of the day on reaching Asia by sailing west jeopardized the vast fortune being made from that endeavor.
As these women live their lives, we explore the turbulent transition from the Late Middle Ages to the Renaissance in such places as Genoa, Madeira, Lisbon, Bilbao, Bayonne, Cordoba, Seville, and Huelva. We see these places from street level. We smell their food cooking, the aromas of commerce and daily life. We taste the food, experience the conflict, and feel the excitement of a world on the edge of expansion: a world whose boundaries were exploding.
This is the story of how these women turned a travelling salesman, the son of a middle class weaver, into the Admiral of the Ocean Sea. It’s the story of how the Basques used these women, and a fish, to change everything.

You already know how Christopher’s story ends. We have all known since grade school. Help me show the world how it began.

</b><p><i>“No one is
commonplace, and I doubt if you can ever read a biography from which you cannot
learn something from the difficulties overcome and the struggles made to
succeed. These are the measuring rods for the progress of humanity.”  </i></p><p><i>-
Pres. Spencer W. Kimball.</i></p>
<p>These words run
deep through everything we are doing here at OurLifeStory.  We have an
insatiable passion for helping others tell their story so they can share it
with their family, friends and people who can benefit. Did you know writing
about your life helps with your memory?  It also helps train you to
express yourself? Writing also helps you review lessons you have learned in the
past.  This is where we started to envision “Our Life Story” and all the
possible benefits we could bring to people:</p>
<p><span>-  </span>Inspiration
through story telling,</p>
<p>-  Learn
about family members who are no longer here,</p><p>-  Pass down family heritage, by recording families memories before we loose them,</p><p></p><p>-  Gain clearer
perspective on personal experiences and feelings, which in turn brings greater
meaning to life,</p>
<p>-  Gain greater
self-knowledge, stronger self-image and enhanced self-esteem,</p>
<p>-  Have the pleasure of sharing
cherished experiences and insight with others,</p>
<p>-  A way of releasing
certain burdens and validating personal experiences, this is in fact central to
the recovery process,</p>
<p>-  Helps us and others to better understand ourselves, in ways we haven’t
before,</p>
<p>-  By understanding past and
present, we derive a clearer perspective of our goals for the future, </p><p>-  Help to create community and show we have more in common with one another than we thought.<br/></p><p>When
reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us
that this is a business that needs to be created. We feel executed properly, we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to tell their
story and give their life a medium.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the online journaling industry.  This paired with
attention to detail and quality service will make us a key player if not leader
in the industry. Our mission is to take care of every funder, supporter and

feel this will be the key to our growth.</p><p><b>So

<p><b><b>Why do I care so much about other people's stories?</b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hi I'm Cynthia, founder of Our Life Story. This
campaign wouldn’t be complete without telling my story and how Our Life Story came to fruition.  When I was 13 years and found out my father wasn’t my
real father, I began to learn the importance of writing and documenting life
experiences.  I was constantly wondering ‘What was my father’s
story?’  From this, I developed a genuine, intuitive nature for listening
to people’s stories and appreciating every aspect they shared.  Being a
mother of two young children, wife, daughter, sister, friend and recovering
from a serious illness, capturing our stories and memories has never become
more important. This is a way of sharing with my children when they ask ""Tell me about Granny"".  </p>
<p>Having trained and worked as a life
coach and counsellor, I have seen firsthand the power of writing our stories
and reflecting on just how extraordinary our lives really are, giving clarity on our
strengths and how we worked through challenges we have experienced throughout life.</p>
<p>With
a team of committed and creative web developers, designers, writers and
business mentors, I have been researching, creating and developing Our Life
Story for over a year now without an income, this is how much it means to
me.  I’ve put my heart into it and now I ask you to join this significant movement with                ""One Story at a Time"".</p>

<p><b>How We'll Use the Funds?</b></p>
<p>We need $20,000 in order to break “Our Life Story” onto the market. That will include web design/development, automation, expert writers, marketing and related expenses for start-up.</p>
<p>Your generous

will assist us with the cost of further development, labour and
production of the platform. More importantly you get the chance to be one of

test our concept to make it better.  We are committed to continuous
improvement so we are always giving people the best possible solutions.</p>
<p>We will also be
using the funding to: </p>
<p>-  Continue
investing and developing in new technology to bring you the latest and most relevant
features to capture and share your stories,</p>
<p>-  Give
you the best experience possible,</p>
<p>-  Provide
the most up-to-date private and secure hosting environment,</p>
<p>-  Launch the digital and print to hardcover book feature for you to share your story with family and friends<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">,</span></p>

our stories with family and friends. We are all missing out on valuable
life lessons and empathy for the experiences of generations before us.
Sharing our stories is fulfilling.  It is something we can all do,
it brings people closer and is a great way to pass down history.  It is
about understanding ourselves, others and our world . These powerful stories
illustrate our shared humanity and show how much more we share in common than
divides us and that is why we created Our Life Story.Help
us establish this significant initiative to serve everyone for as little as $50.00, giving you membership to “WriteMyStory” where you or your loved ones can capture your stories online, add photos and create a beautiful digital book to share with family and friends. You will be surprised what you discover.  Empower us to make this vision
a reality with a donation to this project today!

“No one is
commonplace, and I doubt if you can ever read a biography from which you cannot
learn something from the difficulties overcome and the struggles made to
succeed. These are the measuring rods for the progress of humanity.”  -
Pres. Spencer W. Kimball.
These words run
deep through everything we are doing here at OurLifeStory.  We have an
insatiable passion for helping others tell their story so they can share it
with their family, friends and people who can benefit. Did you know writing
about your life helps with your memory?  It also helps train you to
express yourself? Writing also helps you review lessons you have learned in the
past.  This is where we started to envision “Our Life Story” and all the
possible benefits we could bring to people:
-  Inspiration
through story telling,
-  Learn
about family members who are no longer here,-  Pass down family heritage, by recording families memories before we loose them,-  Gain clearer
perspective on personal experiences and feelings, which in turn brings greater
meaning to life,
-  Gain greater
self-knowledge, stronger self-image and enhanced self-esteem,
-  Have the pleasure of sharing
cherished experiences and insight with others,
-  A way of releasing
certain burdens and validating personal experiences, this is in fact central to
the recovery process,
-  Helps us and others to better understand ourselves, in ways we haven’t
before,
-  By understanding past and
present, we derive a clearer perspective of our goals for the future, -  Help to create community and show we have more in common with one another than we thought.When
reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us
that this is a business that needs to be created. We feel executed properly, we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to tell their
story and give their life a medium.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the online journaling industry.  This paired with

Why do I care so much about other people's stories?



Hi I'm Cynthia, founder of Our Life Story. This
campaign wouldn’t be complete without telling my story and how Our Life Story came to fruition.  When I was 13 years and found out my father wasn’t my
real father, I began to learn the importance of writing and documenting life
experiences.  I was constantly wondering ‘What was my father’s
story?’  From this, I developed a genuine, intuitive nature for listening
to people’s stories and appreciating every aspect they shared.  Being a
mother of two young children, wife, daughter, sister, friend and recovering
from a serious illness, capturing our stories and memories has never become
more important. This is a way of sharing with my children when they ask ""Tell me about Granny"".  
Having trained and worked as a life
coach and counsellor, I have seen firsthand the power of writing our stories
and reflecting on just how extraordinary our lives really are, giving clarity on our
strengths and how we worked through challenges we have experienced throughout life.
With
a team of committed and creative web developers, designers, writers and
business mentors, I have been researching, creating and developing Our Life
Story for over a year now without an income, this is how much it means to
me.  I’ve put my heart into it and now I ask you to join this significant movement with                ""One Story at a Time"".



How We'll Use the Funds?
We need $20,000 in order to break “Our Life Story” onto the market. That will include web design/development, automation, expert writers, marketing and related expenses for start-up.
Your generous
funding will help us get things started in order to realise our concept. It
will assist us with the cost of further development, labour and
production of the platform. More importantly you get the chance to be one of
the first users of the “Our Life Story”.  We will also use our funding to
test our concept to make it better.  We are committed to continuous
improvement so we are always giving people the best possible solutions.
We will also be
using the funding to: 
-  Continue
investing and developing in new technology to bring you the latest and most relevant
features to capture and share your stories,
-  Give
you the best experience possible,
-  Provide
the most up-to-date private and secure hosting environment,
-  Launch the digital and print to hardcover book feature for you to share your story with family and friends,


-  Develop and launch the photo scanning tools for you to easily capture your historical family photos from your album or shoe box to digital.

<p><span><b>ABOUT OUR BOOK: </b></span></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has the legal right to do something that no other organization or person in the United States has; it can create money out of thin air. At the same time, they lack competitive pressure, and have little outside oversight. This creates extremely unnatural conditions for the Fed, which also causes a lot of problems. </p>
<br/><p>In writing this book, I am seeking to educate everyday people about these problems, to create awareness, and to offer a solution to these problems that will make everyone better off in the long run. In addition, I hope to educate people about finance and economics in general. This book is written so that anyone can read it, understand it, and hopefully learn from it. </p>
<br/><p>The book will give readers an overview of the Federal Reserve’s origins and how it came to be what it is today. I will also explain the Fed’s objectives, and how it is not only failing to meet them, but also reaching outside of their stated purpose, spending more money then they should be. The Fed is fat and it needs to trim down. </p>

<h3>What is This About?</h3>
<p>Hello and thank you for
joining me for a few minutes to learn about this very special crowdfunding that
I am working on.  To help publish my book ""Don't Make Me Come Down There""</p>
<p>I probably look and sound like a very well put
together person and today I am but, the fact of the matter is I was diagnosed
nine years ago with major depression along with ADD. That was after suffering
with it for thirty-six years and failing at two attempts of suicide.    While
living with it I can tell you first hand that the pain is very real. Every part
of my body ached and some days I was so low that I had to look up just to see
the ground.   </p>
<p>Since getting healthy in 2006 I have written a
book about the fact that there is help out there for whoever wants it that is
in the process of getting edited and ready for publication.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I came to the realization that no one should
ever have to live the way I did thinking that it was normal to have all the
feelings that I had. So besides writing I had also decided to help my fellow
human being by speaking out about my journey from the dark side by going back
to college and getting my BA in Social Sciences while at the same time holding
down a job. I am also in the process of getting certified as a Life Coach to
help people get their lives back on the track to a very fulfilling life. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is not something you
need to deal with on your own. There are avenues of help, you, just have to be
willing to seek them. While living with the depression I had bouts of low
self-esteem, did not want to be around anyone, and had days where I did not
care whether I lived or died.  Depression
and suicide are not choosy. Great athletes have completed suicide as well as well-known
authors and people in high government jobs. Isn’t it about time we come into
the 21<sup>st</sup> century and deal with mental illness.    </p>
<p>I thought last August
after Robin Williams took his own life there would be much more of an outcry
for education to help people who recognized they had some of the same symptoms.
That did not happened at least I did not think so. I believe there can never be
too much help. I am not one those people who feels frightened to speak out
about my illness I feel that if I help one person then I have done my job. That
is why I am creating the foundation and why I am asking for your support in
donating to it as well as my book.  I am
not a wealthy well known celebrity, I am person like all of you who gets up
every morning and goes to work and deals with whatever life throws at us. So
please will you think about giving. Who knows what lies around that next curve in
the road of life; you may be the one who needs my resource for help. </p>
<p>In closing let me leave
you with these words you are only one person in this world but, you may be the
world to that one person. Remember you never know who you are talking to you
could be saving someone’s life just by talking to them. </p>
<p>Thank you and GOD Bless
you.  </p>

His family moved to Fair Lawn, NJ where Lloyd attended school all the way through high school. After high school Lloyd attended a local community college but stopped after one semester and enlisted in the Air Force. After being diagnosed as being unfit for military duty he was discharged with an honorable discharge and returned to New Jersey and found a job in the hospitality field.
 In 1978 Lloyd met his first wife and relocated across the country to Seattle. </p>
<p>Lloyd was married for 12 years and has two children from that marriage. In 1998 Lloyd met his second wife and together they set off to see the United States. They moved first to Nashville, TN then to Jacksonville Fl. where in 2001 Lloyd, had his first real experience with major depression. It was there that Lloyd first thought about and planned to commit suicide.
 Fortunately he did not fulfill his desire. He got some help but did not get the real help that changed his whole life until 2006 when he and his wife had moved to Texas. It was then while seeing a therapist that Lloyd started writing. </p>
<p>He ended up publishing his first book titled Search for Happiness My Journey from Darkness into the Light. Which he hopes to use to help other people realize they are not alone in their fight with depression. Most recently Lloyd was divorced from his second wife.  Lloyd loves bowling competitively as well as continuing to write he is finishing up his second book. He also enjoys traveling and sightseeing; he has been to 46 of the 50 states. </p>

This campaighn is to publish the book ""Don't Make Me Come Down There"" and the expenses associated with publishing and marketing.
Short Summary Lloyd Rosen was born in New York City. His family moved to Fair Lawn, NJ where Lloyd attended school all the way through high school. After high school Lloyd attended a local community college but stopped after one semester and enlisted in the Air Force. After being diagnosed as being unfit for military duty he was discharged with an honorable discharge and returned to New Jersey and found a job in the hospitality field.
 In 1978 Lloyd met his first wife and relocated across the country to Seattle. 
Lloyd was married for 12 years and has two children from that marriage. In 1998 Lloyd met his second wife and together they set off to see the United States. They moved first to Nashville, TN then to Jacksonville Fl. where in 2001 Lloyd, had his first real experience with major depression. It was there that Lloyd first thought about and planned to commit suicide.
 Fortunately he did not fulfill his desire. He got some help but did not get the real help that changed his whole life until 2006 when he and his wife had moved to Texas. It was then while seeing a therapist that Lloyd started writing. 
He ended up publishing his first book titled Search for Happiness My Journey from Darkness into the Light. Which he hopes to use to help other people realize they are not alone in their fight with depression. Most recently Lloyd was divorced from his second wife.  Lloyd loves bowling competitively as well as continuing to write he is finishing up his second book. He also enjoys traveling and sightseeing; he has been to 46 of the 50 states.
