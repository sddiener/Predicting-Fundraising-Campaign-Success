<i><b>Was ist das Land der Hoffnung</b></i><i><b>?</b></i>
</h1><p><b>希望の国とは？</b></p>
<br/><p>Some years ago, I performed 
as a soloist with the San Francisco Ballet, and during my time backstage
 I took on a huge creative project that lasted nine years - to turn a 
blank square meter piece of fabric into a beautiful landscape using the 
art of needlepainting, or embroidery. The finished piece, pictured 
below, shows a spectacular world where humans and nature lived in 
perfect harmony with one another. I called it Land of Hope, as it 
depicts what I believe the world could be like if we empower ourselves 
and our children to do good. </p><p><i>Während der Zeit, die ich als Solist des San Francisco Ballet hinter der Bühne bei Proben und Warten verbrachte, begann 
 ich ein Projekt, das letztlich neun Jahre dauerte: ich begann ein 
Einquadratmeter großes Stück Stoff lückenlos und mit Reliefs mit sehr 
dünnen Fäden zu besticken. Langsam entstand eine Märchenlandschaft, in 
der Menschen, Tiere und Fabelwesen in Harmonie miteinander und mit der 
Natur leben. So entstand das ""Land der Hoffnung"", von dem ich glaube, 
das es möglich ist, wenn wir und unsere Kindern sich dafür entscheiden.</i></p><p>何年も前の事ですが、サンフランシスコバレエ団でソリストとして踊っていた頃、私は舞台裏で待っている間９年の歳月をかけ、大掛かりなプロ
ジェクトを手掛けました。それは、一枚の無地の生地に「ニードルペインティング」（刺繍）で、美しい風景を描くものでした。出来上がった作品は、下の写真
でご覧いただける通り、自然と人間が完全に調和して暮らす素晴らしい世界を描いています。それは、大人も子どもも皆が良い行いをしたら世界はきっとこんな
風になるだろうと私が信じる「希望の国」を表現しています。</p><p>After leaving the ballet, my wife 
and I opened our own dance studio in Berlin. Over the years, we have 
watched many of our students grow from small children into beautiful, 
flourishing women and men with strong values of friendship, courage, and
 helpfulness. Inspired by their positive influences in the world, we 
wish to create a multilingual children's story book intended to empower 
even more children to grow as our students did and make the world a 
better place. Our book, based on the Land of Hope tapestry, would use 
close-up images taken from the needlepainting artwork to tell a story of
 how to grow up to be a strong person by encouraging children to respect
 others, have courage, and be helpful, along with many other important 
lessons.</p><p><i>Nachdem
 ich das Ballett verliess, zog ich nach Berlin und schloss mich meiner 
Frau an, die dort ein Tanzstudio betrieb. Im Laufe der Jahre wurden wir 
Zeugen, wie aus kleinen Ballettschülern Erwachsene wurden, die als junge
 Männer und Frauen mit Werten wie Freundschaft, Mut und 
Hilfsbereitschaft lebten. Dies inspirierte mich zu der Idee eines 
Kinderbuches, das eine mehrsprachiges Geschichte erzählt. Und vielleicht
 andere Kinder beeinflusst ebenfalls andere zu respektieren, mutig und 
liebevoll zu sein, und die welt zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Als

<p>Land der Hoffnung, Landschaftsbild mit filigranen Details
</p>
<p>The completed Land of Hope, a full landscape in astonishing detail.

</p>
<p>「希望の国」の全貌</p>
</blockquote><h1><b>The Story</b></h1><h1><b><i>Die Geschichte</i></b></h1><p><b>あらすじ</b></p>
<br/><p>The
 story focuses on Pepito, a man smaller than a blade of grass. He is 
envious of those around him who are big and strong, and his greatest 
wish is to be like them. He falls asleep one day and wakes up in the 
Land of Hope, where he meets many fascinating creatures. He asks each of
 them how he can become big and strong like them. </p>
<p>One after 
another, each character gives suggestions to help him become a better 
person, such as having respect for others, giving a helping hand where 
needed, having courage in tough situations, and so on. In the end, 
Pepito realizes that having a big heart is more important than having a 
big body, and that even if he is small he can still make great changes 
in the world. </p>
<p><i>Die Geschichte erzählt von Pepito, einem Männlein klein wie ein Grashalm .
 Er ist neidisch auf alle um ihn herum, die groß und kräftig sind, er 
wünscht sich ebenso zu sein. Eines tages erwachte er im Land der 
Hoffnung und trifft dort viele
 faszinierende Wesen. Er fragt jeden, wie er denn groß und stark werden 
könne. Einer nach dem anderen gibt einen Rat und macht Vorschläge, um 
ihm zu helfen. Z.B. Respekt für andere zu haben, anderen in der Not zu 
helfen oder Mut in schwierigen Situationen zu beweisen und so weiter. Am
 Ende versteht Pepito, dass es wichtiger ist ein großes Herz als einen 
großen Körper zu haben, und dass auch ein kleines Männlein große Dinge 
in der Welt bewirken kann!</i></p>
<p>主人公は、芝生の草よりも背の低いペピートです。彼は、周りにいる大きくて強い男の人たちに憧れています。ペピートの一番の願いは彼等のよ
うに強くてたくましくなる事です。ある日、ペピートが目覚めると、彼は希望の国にいました。そこで彼は、風変わりで素敵な住人たちに出会う度に、どうした
ら強く、大きくなれるか尋ねました。</p>
<p>希望の国の住人達は、ペピートの問いかけに、他者に敬意を持って接する事、困った人を助ける事、困難な状況でも勇気を持って立ち向かう事など様々な
助言をくれました。最後にペピートは、身体が大きいことより、大きな心を持つ方が大事だということ、自分がどんなに小柄でも世の中を大きく変えられるんだ
という事に気がつきました。</p>

<i>One of Horacio's sketches of Pepito. Various images like this one

Seiten auftaucht, wo ihn die Kinder suchen müssen. Mehr Information zum 
Lay-Out  weiter  unten auf deiser seite.
</i>
<p>
オーラシオが描いたペピートのスケッチ。このようなイメージを絵本の所々に描いて、子ども達に楽しんでもらおうと思っています。絵本のレイアウトに関しては、下記をご覧下さい。</p>
<h1><b>Why is this so important? </b></h1>
<h1><b><i>Warum ist dieses Buch wichtig?</i></b></h1>
<p><b>このプロジェクトの重要性</b></p>
<br/><p>It is
 our belief that children cannot get enough positive influences in their
 growing years, so that they can become adults with good values to live 
by. When we raise a child to be good and compassionate, we bring more 
positive energy into the world. It's no secret that there are issues 
that exist around the globe that keep some people from living the best 
life they could have, and by teaching our next generations to be 
compassionate and helpful, we create a force for good that could, with 
time, bring peace to this world. The more we encourage children to have 
strong positive values, the closer we come to bringing the Land of Hope 
off the canvas and into reality.</p>
<p><i>Wir
 glauben fest daran, dass Kinder garnicht genug positive Einflüsse bei 
ihrer Erziehung erfahren können, um später als Erwachsene ein festes 
Fundament an positiven Glaubenssätzen zu haben. Jedes Kind, das zu 
Mitgefühl erzogen wird, wird selber immer einen positiven Beitrag in 
seinem Leben leisten. Die Welt ist vielerorts in Aufruhr, es gibt 
weltweit ernste Probleme. Da ist es wichtig, den Kindern liebevolle 
Energie und Erziehung zu geben, damit die Welt zu mehr Frieden und 
liebevollem Miteinander findet. Umso mehr Kinder starke positive 
Wertvorstellungen haben, umso eher kann aus dem Land of Hope Realität 
werden!</i></p>
<p>今
の子ども達は、正しい価値観を持つ大人へと成長する課程において、良い影響を与えられる機会が減っているのではないかと感じています。私たち大人が、思い
やりと正しい心をもつ子どもを育てることができれば、世界にもっと有益な変化をもたらし、社会に貢献できると考えています。今、世界ではさまざまな問題が
起きていて、本来なら手にできるはずの幸せな生活を送れない人々がいます。将来をになう子ども達に、人に対する思いやりを育くみ、大切さを教え伝えること
ができたら、きっといつか、それが世界の平和につながっていくに違いないと考えます。子ども達に強い正義感や前向きに生きていくすばらしさを伝えることが
できたら、この「希望の国」を布の上の刺繍の世界から現実のものに近づけることができるはずです。</p>
<p>We
 are also aiming to make this book multilingual, for two main reasons: 
1) We want Pepito's journey to be accessible to children all over the 
world, not just in English-speaking countries, and 2) exposing children 
to foreign languages at an early age helps them gain an interest in 
other cultures, which helps them develop the ideas of empathy and 
cooperation.  These go well with the other values presented in this 
book, and are especially helpful in our modern global world. Our base 
goal is for English and German, and we are working with a Japanese 
translator. Perhaps another language could be added if there is
 enough space and interest. We will keep you up-to-date on any 
developments.</p>
<p><i>Unser
 Ziel ist es, das Buch mehrsprachig heraus zu geben. Das hat mehrere 
Gründe, zum einem kann so Pepitos Geschichte in vielen Ländern gelesen 
und verstanden werden, zum anderen lernen Kinder 
von klein auf, dass es verschiedene Sprachen und Kulturen gibt, deren 
Unterschiedlichkeit wertfrei und selbstverständlich ist. Das ist in der 
globalen Welt von heute sicher von Vorteil. Im 
Moment gibt es die geschichte auf deutsch und englisch, eine japanische 
Übersetzung ist in Planung, auch andere Sprachen können hinzu gefügt 
werden, je nach Platz und Interesse. Wir halten Sie über die Entwicklung auf dem Laufenden,</i></p>
<p>私は、次に挙げます二つの理由でこの絵本を多国語で出版したいと考えています。まず一つ目は、英語圏だけでなく、世界中の子ども達にペピー
トの冒険を楽しんでもらいたいと思っています。そして二つ目は、子ども達には早くから外国語に触れる機会を与え、自国とは異なる文化に興味を持ち、他者に
対する共感や、協調性を養う事に役立ててほしいと思うからです。</p>

以上二点は、この絵本から学んでもらいたい他の大切な価値観とともに、子ども達がグローバル化が進む現代社会を生きていくために、非常に役立つものだと考
えます。　先ずは、英語、ドイツ語で出版する事が目標ですが、現在、日本語への翻訳も検討中です。賛同・支援して下さる方がいれば、その他の言語への翻訳
も検討したいと思っております。当プロジェクトの進展については、随時ご報告申し上げます。<br/>
<h1><b>What We Need</b></h1>
<h1><b><i>Was wir brauchen</i></b></h1>
<p><b>皆様のご支援のお願い</b></p>
<br/><p>Land
 of Hope has already been fully written, and we are already working with
 a German publishing company, S. Fischer Verlage, to get it out into the
 world. They have given us a price estimate of 7,000 Euro as an absolute
 minimum for production. It's a greater amount than we can afford to pay
 out-of-pocket, which is 
why we are turning to you for help! Every dollar or euro counts. </p>
<p><i>Das

 Land der Hoffnung ist bereits fertig geschrieben, und wir sind in 
Kontakt mit einem deutschen Verlagshaus (S. Fischer Verlage). Dort hat 
man uns einen Mindestpreis von 7 500 € für Druck und Vertrieb genannt. 
Leider fehlt uns das nötige geld, so wenden wir uns an Sie - jeder noch 
so kleine Betrag hilft. </i></p>
<p>「希望の国」の原稿は、既に出来上がっており、ドイツの出版社、S. Fischer 
Verlageから、絵本を世に送りだす準備を進めています。しかし、出版には、最低でも7,000ユーロの出資を要します。これは、私が個人的に用意で
きる金額を上回るものです。そのため、ぜひ皆様のご支援を頂ければと、今回お願いしております次第です。ご賛同いただきご支援を賜ることができましたら幸
いです。</p>
<p>However,
 our ultimate goal is €13,000 - that would cover editing, printing, 
production, grade-A advertisement, shipping and distribution to 
bookstores around the country, and would also upgrade the book into a 
larger, more child-friendly format. We've read the statistics on 
successful crowdfunding projects and know that a lower number is easier 
to reach, so we're hoping your generosity will go above and beyond our 
minimum goal to help us reach €13,000.</p>
<p><i>Das
 ultimative Ziel sind 13 000 €, was ausser Druck und allen damit 
verbundenen Kosten wie Versand und Vertrieb eine Top-Grade-A- 
Werbeaktion mit einschliesst. Das Buch könnte so 
auch ein etwas größeres, kinderfreundlicheres Format bekommen. Wir haben
 uns über erfolgreiche Crowdfunding-Projekte informiert und hoffen sehr,
 dass wir es schaffen, die optimale Summe zu erzielen. </i></p>
<p>上記の金額は、出版に最低限必要な額であり、編集、印刷、製本、広告、発送、国内外への書籍流通・販売、そして、子ども達にとって親しみや
すい大きめのサイズ、読みやすいフォーマットにするなど、多少の工夫を加えますと、必要経費は13,000ユーロ程度になると概算しております。目標金額
を低めに設定したほうがプロジェクトの成功率が高いという統計を目にしたこともありますが、わたし達としましても、皆様の温かいご支援をいただき、子ども
達のためにより質の高い絵本を届けることができるよう、努力を惜しまない所存です。</p>
<p>Even if you can't 
contribute monetarily to Land of Hope, you can still help us out by 
spreading the word to anyone who may be interested! Sharing, emailing, 
tweeting, and word-of-mouth are absolutely invaluable to getting this 
project off the ground.</p>
<p><i>Wenn
 Sie im Moment finanziell nicht helfen können, freuen wir uns, wenn Sie 
helfen, indem Sie andere auf das Projekt aufmerksam machen, die 
vielleicht helfen können. Soziale Netzwerke, Emails, Kaffeklasch, 
Mundpropaganda, all dies trägt dazu bei, das Projekt zu verwirklichen. </i></p>
<p>「希
望の国」に金銭的なご支援を頂けない場合でも、是非、このプロジェクトの事をお知り合いの方々へ伝えていただけたら幸いです。　情報のシェアリング、E
メールやツイッターを介して、又は、直接お話して頂くだけでも、このプロジェクトの実現に向けて非常にありがたい支援となります。</p>
<p> This book is perfect for parents of young
 children, expecting parents, or even aunts, uncles, grandparents, and 
other relatives searching for a gift for the young ones in their lives. </p>
<p><i>Dieses
 Buch ist ein schönes Geschenk für Eltern kleiner Kinder, also Eltern, 
Tanten, Onkel, Omas und Opas, Familie und Freunde- hier ist ein Geschenk
 für Eure  kleinen Lieblinge!</i></p>
<p>この絵本は、幼いお子様のご両親、もうすぐ生まれてくるお子様を心待ちになさっているご夫婦はもちろん、おじ様おば様、おじい様おばあ様、親戚の方々にとって、身近にいる大切なお子様達への特別なプレゼントににぴったりだと思います。</p>

<br/><br/><h1>Predicted Timeline</h1>
<h1><i>Zeitplan</i></h1>
<p><b>想定タイムライン</b></p>
<br/><p>So, how long is this all going to take? </p>
<p><i>So, wann wird was passieren?</i></p>
<p>このプロジェクトのタイムスケジュールは、どの様なものでしょうか。</p>
<br/><p>In a perfect world, the timeline would look something like this:</p>
<p><i>Wenn alles klappt, sieht der Plan aus wie folgt:</i></p>
<p>想定しているタイムスケジュールは、以下の通りです。</p>
<br/><p>October 31st, 2014: Crowdfunding begins!</p>
<p>Mid-December
 2014: Crowdfunding ends, all funds calculated, collected, and sent to 
publishers. Digital perks sent to supporters - just in time for the 
holidays!</p>
<p>January 2015: Publishing company begins production process for Land of Hope</p>
<p>Summer 2015: Printing is completed, books sent to Horacio and later distributed to bookstores</p>
<p>Summer/Fall 2015: Physical rewards shipped out to supporters, arriving once again just in time for the holidays!</p>
<p><i>31. Oktober 2014: das Crowdfunding beginnt!<br/>
Mitte Dezenber 2014: das Crowdfunding endet, alle Spenden gehen an den 
Verlag, die digitalen Perks (Belohnungen)  gehen an die Spender, 
pünktlich zum Weihnachtsfest!<br/>
Januar 2015: der Verlag beginnt die Produktion.<br/>
Sommer 2015: der Druck ist fertig, die Bücher werden versendet und an Buchläden verschickt.<br/>
Sommer/Herbst 2015: alle nicht-digitalen Perks , d.h. alle Geschenke werden verschickt, pünktlich zum nächsten Fest!</i></p>
<p>2014年10月31日：クラウドファンディング開始！</p>
<p>2014年12月中旬：クラウドファンディング終了。支援額の計算、出版社に送金。支援者への特典中、ネット上送信できるものは、クリスマス前にお届けします！</p>
<p>2015年1月：出版社「希望の国」絵本制作開始</p>
<p>2015年夏期：印刷・製本終了。オーラシオの手元に本が届けられ、いよいよ書店流通へ。</p>
<p>2015年夏・秋期：デジタル以外の特典を支援者様へ郵送。</p>
<p>Realistically, we know lots of things could happen to 
delay this process. If the crowdfuding isn't as successful as we hope, 
it may take some extra time to scrape up the last bit of money needed to
 pay the publishers. Printing may take longer than expected at the 
publishers, and mailing speeds can sometimes be unpredictable, 
especially internationally and around holidays. We can't know ahead of 
time what might happen, but we promise to keep you informed of all 
updates, good and bad, as soon as we find out about them. </p>
<p><i>Es können immer Dinge passieren, die den Ablauf verzögern. Wenn z.B. das
 Crowdfunding nicht den gewünschten Erfolg hat. kann es noch
 dauern, bis wir den Rest zusammen gekratzt haben. Der Druck kann läner 
dauern, Versandzeiten können abweichen (vor allem international). Falls 
eine Verzögerung eintritt, werden alle benachrichtigt sobald wir davon 
Kenntnis haben.</i></p>
<p>以上は、あくまでも想定しているタイムラインであり、現実的には、様々な原因でプロセスに遅れが出る可能性が考えられます。例えば、当キャ
ンペーン中に集められた支援金が目標額を下回った場合、残りの必要な額を集めて出版社に送金するのに時間がかかったり、印刷が予想以上に長引いたり、郵
送、特にホリデー・シーズン中の海外郵送に時間がかかる事など考えられます。このの様な状況に変更があり次第、責任を持って皆様に随時ご報告致します。</p>
<br/><h1>How it Will Look</h1>
<h1><i>Wie wird das Buch aussehen?</i></h1>
<p><b>完成した絵本</b></p>
<br/><p>We are envisioning our book to be approximately 22 x 1 x 30
 centimeters. Each turn of the page will reveal a beautiful photograph 
from the Land of Hope tapestry, with a corresponding text (in at least 
two languages) on the other side that tells Pepito's story. Small 
sketches of the little man in various poses will appear alongside the 
text.</p>
<p><i>Wir planen das Buch in der Größe 22
 x 1 x 30 cm. Bei jedem Umblättern sieht man eine neue Seite mit einem 
Bildausschenitt des Werkes ""Land der Hoffnung"" zeigen mit den dazu 
gehörigen Texten in mindestens zwei Sprachen auf der gegenüberliegenden 
Seite. Kleine Zeichnungen des kleinen Pepito ergänzen das Bild.</i></p>
<p>完成した絵本は、22cm x 1cm x 30cm 
程のサイズを考えています。各ページを開くと、そこには、「希望の国」刺繍のタペストリーの美しい写真が広がり、それにあわせて少なくとも2つ以上の言語
でペピートのお話しを描きます。文章の隣には、かわいらしいペピートが様々なポーズで現れます。</p>

<i>One of our draft pages. So far, this only has the German text, and 
the height isn't exactly right. As soon as we have an updated version of
 this, we will let you know! See below for the English and Japanese translations that 
will be on this page: </i><br/><i><br/>Hier ein Beispiel, erstmal nur mit dem deutschen Text und vorläufigem Format. Der englische Text folgt:

<p>絵本の中のあるページのドラフトです。ここでは、皆さまに絵本のイメージをお伝えするために見本としてドイツ語の本文を入れてあります。本のサイズ少々完成版と異なります。校正したものができましたら改めて掲載します。下記に日本語の仮訳を掲載しましたのでご覧ください。</p>
<br/><br/><p>'To his great surprise Pepito met a man who was even smaller then he was.</p>
<p>Pepito said to him: “How can you be happy being so very small?”</p>
<p>And the small man answered: “Because I see that life is full of treasures like this pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.”</p>
<p>“Yes”, said Pepito, “I see. But I want to be big.”</p>
<p>“Good,"" said the small man, “then you must respect all persons 
whether they are smaller or bigger than you; then you will be big. Come 
with me to the pond for a drink.”'</p>

ペピートはびっくりして目を丸くしました。

<p>ここには、僕より小さい住人がいたなんて！</p>
<p>「どうしてそんなに小さくても幸せでいられるの？」ペピートは、尋ねました。</p>
<p>「それは、この虹の果てにある黄金の壷の様な宝ものが、人生には、たくさんあるからだよ。」と応えました。</p>
<p>「へぇ。そうなんだ。」「でもね、ぼくは、大きくなりたいんだ。」</p>
「そうか。」その小さな住人は言いました。「それなら、自分より大きい人でも、小さい人でも、誰に対しても敬意をもって接することだな。そうしたら君は大きくなれるさ。ほら、一緒に池のほうにいって何か飲もうじゃないか。」<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FF0EtvaPUnBA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DF0EtvaPUnBA&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FF0EtvaPUnBA%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fytu_ja55DXU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dytu_ja55DXU&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fytu_ja55DXU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><h4><br/></h4><h2><b>Perks</b></h2><p>

Was ist das Land der Hoffnung?
希望の国とは？
Some years ago, I performed 
as a soloist with the San Francisco Ballet, and during my time backstage
 I took on a huge creative project that lasted nine years - to turn a 
blank square meter piece of fabric into a beautiful landscape using the 
art of needlepainting, or embroidery. The finished piece, pictured 
below, shows a spectacular world where humans and nature lived in 
perfect harmony with one another. I called it Land of Hope, as it 
depicts what I believe the world could be like if we empower ourselves 
and our children to do good. Während der Zeit, die ich als Solist des San Francisco Ballet hinter der Bühne bei Proben und Warten verbrachte, begann 
 ich ein Projekt, das letztlich neun Jahre dauerte: ich begann ein 
Einquadratmeter großes Stück Stoff lückenlos und mit Reliefs mit sehr 
dünnen Fäden zu besticken. Langsam entstand eine Märchenlandschaft, in 
der Menschen, Tiere und Fabelwesen in Harmonie miteinander und mit der 
Natur leben. So entstand das ""Land der Hoffnung"", von dem ich glaube, 
das es möglich ist, wenn wir und unsere Kindern sich dafür entscheiden.何年も前の事ですが、サンフランシスコバレエ団でソリストとして踊っていた頃、私は舞台裏で待っている間９年の歳月をかけ、大掛かりなプロ
ジェクトを手掛けました。それは、一枚の無地の生地に「ニードルペインティング」（刺繍）で、美しい風景を描くものでした。出来上がった作品は、下の写真
でご覧いただける通り、自然と人間が完全に調和して暮らす素晴らしい世界を描いています。それは、大人も子どもも皆が良い行いをしたら世界はきっとこんな
風になるだろうと私が信じる「希望の国」を表現しています。After leaving the ballet, my wife 
and I opened our own dance studio in Berlin. Over the years, we have 
watched many of our students grow from small children into beautiful, 
flourishing women and men with strong values of friendship, courage, and
 helpfulness. Inspired by their positive influences in the world, we 
wish to create a multilingual children's story book intended to empower 
even more children to grow as our students did and make the world a 
better place. Our book, based on the Land of Hope tapestry, would use 
close-up images taken from the needlepainting artwork to tell a story of
 how to grow up to be a strong person by encouraging children to respect
 others, have courage, and be helpful, along with many other important 
lessons.Nachdem
 ich das Ballett verliess, zog ich nach Berlin und schloss mich meiner 
Frau an, die dort ein Tanzstudio betrieb. Im Laufe der Jahre wurden wir 
Zeugen, wie aus kleinen Ballettschülern Erwachsene wurden, die als junge
 Männer und Frauen mit Werten wie Freundschaft, Mut und 
Hilfsbereitschaft lebten. Dies inspirierte mich zu der Idee eines 
Kinderbuches, das eine mehrsprachiges Geschichte erzählt. Und vielleicht
 andere Kinder beeinflusst ebenfalls andere zu respektieren, mutig und 
liebevoll zu sein, und die welt zu einem besseren Platz zu machen. Als 
Hintergrund benutze ich Nahaufnahmen des Needlepainting Werkes Land of 
Hope.
バレエの世界を離れた後、私は妻と共にベルリンにスタジオを開きました。そこで私達は、子どもだった生徒達が友情、勇敢、誠実さを大切にする、輝きにあふ
れた大人へと成長し羽ばたいて行く姿を目の当たりにしました。社会で活躍する彼等の姿に私は強く心を動かされ、更に多くの子ども達に、私の生徒達の様に成
長して、より良い世界を作ってほしいと願うようになり、多言語の絵本を作ろうと決心しました。この絵本は、「希望の国」の刺繍のイメージを用いて、人を敬
う事、勇気を持つ事、人に親切に接する事といった大切な人生のレッスンが、子ども達の素晴らしい成長に結びついていくということを物語っています。
Land der Hoffnung, Landschaftsbild mit filigranen Details

The completed Land of Hope, a full landscape in astonishing detail.


「希望の国」の全貌
The StoryDie Geschichteあらすじ
The
 story focuses on Pepito, a man smaller than a blade of grass. He is 
envious of those around him who are big and strong, and his greatest 
wish is to be like them. He falls asleep one day and wakes up in the 
Land of Hope, where he meets many fascinating creatures. He asks each of
 them how he can become big and strong like them. 
One after 
another, each character gives suggestions to help him become a better 
person, such as having respect for others, giving a helping hand where 
needed, having courage in tough situations, and so on. In the end, 
Pepito realizes that having a big heart is more important than having a 
big body, and that even if he is small he can still make great changes 
in the world. 
Die Geschichte erzählt von Pepito, einem Männlein klein wie ein Grashalm .
 Er ist neidisch auf alle um ihn herum, die groß und kräftig sind, er 
wünscht sich ebenso zu sein. Eines tages erwachte er im Land der 
Hoffnung und trifft dort viele
 faszinierende Wesen. Er fragt jeden, wie er denn groß und stark werden 
könne. Einer nach dem anderen gibt einen Rat und macht Vorschläge, um 
ihm zu helfen. Z.B. Respekt für andere zu haben, anderen in der Not zu 
helfen oder Mut in schwierigen Situationen zu beweisen und so weiter. Am
 Ende versteht Pepito, dass es wichtiger ist ein großes Herz als einen 
großen Körper zu haben, und dass auch ein kleines Männlein große Dinge 
in der Welt bewirken kann!
主人公は、芝生の草よりも背の低いペピートです。彼は、周りにいる大きくて強い男の人たちに憧れています。ペピートの一番の願いは彼等のよ
うに強くてたくましくなる事です。ある日、ペピートが目覚めると、彼は希望の国にいました。そこで彼は、風変わりで素敵な住人たちに出会う度に、どうした
ら強く、大きくなれるか尋ねました。
希望の国の住人達は、ペピートの問いかけに、他者に敬意を持って接する事、困った人を助ける事、困難な状況でも勇気を持って立ち向かう事など様々な
助言をくれました。最後にペピートは、身体が大きいことより、大きな心を持つ方が大事だということ、自分がどんなに小柄でも世の中を大きく変えられるんだ
という事に気がつきました。

One of Horacio's sketches of Pepito. Various images like this one 
will be scattered throughout the pages for children to find - more 
information on the imagined layout can be found further down on this 
page.Dies
 ist eine von Horacio´s Zeichnungen. Dies ist Pepito, der auf vielen 
Seiten auftaucht, wo ihn die Kinder suchen müssen. Mehr Information zum 
Lay-Out  weiter  unten auf deiser seite.


オーラシオが描いたペピートのスケッチ。このようなイメージを絵本の所々に描いて、子ども達に楽しんでもらおうと思っています。絵本のレイアウトに関しては、下記をご覧下さい。
Why is this so important? 
Warum ist dieses Buch wichtig?
このプロジェクトの重要性
It is
 our belief that children cannot get enough positive influences in their
 growing years, so that they can become adults with good values to live 
by. When we raise a child to be good and compassionate, we bring more 
positive energy into the world. It's no secret that there are issues 
that exist around the globe that keep some people from living the best 
life they could have, and by teaching our next generations to be 
compassionate and helpful, we create a force for good that could, with 
time, bring peace to this world. The more we encourage children to have 
strong positive values, the closer we come to bringing the Land of Hope 
off the canvas and into reality.
Wir
 glauben fest daran, dass Kinder garnicht genug positive Einflüsse bei 
ihrer Erziehung erfahren können, um später als Erwachsene ein festes 
Fundament an positiven Glaubenssätzen zu haben. Jedes Kind, das zu 
Mitgefühl erzogen wird, wird selber immer einen positiven Beitrag in 
seinem Leben leisten. Die Welt ist vielerorts in Aufruhr, es gibt 
weltweit ernste Probleme. Da ist es wichtig, den Kindern liebevolle 
Energie und Erziehung zu geben, damit die Welt zu mehr Frieden und 
liebevollem Miteinander findet. Umso mehr Kinder starke positive 
Wertvorstellungen haben, umso eher kann aus dem Land of Hope Realität 
werden!
今
の子ども達は、正しい価値観を持つ大人へと成長する課程において、良い影響を与えられる機会が減っているのではないかと感じています。私たち大人が、思い
やりと正しい心をもつ子どもを育てることができれば、世界にもっと有益な変化をもたらし、社会に貢献できると考えています。今、世界ではさまざまな問題が
起きていて、本来なら手にできるはずの幸せな生活を送れない人々がいます。将来をになう子ども達に、人に対する思いやりを育くみ、大切さを教え伝えること
ができたら、きっといつか、それが世界の平和につながっていくに違いないと考えます。子ども達に強い正義感や前向きに生きていくすばらしさを伝えることが
できたら、この「希望の国」を布の上の刺繍の世界から現実のものに近づけることができるはずです。
We
 are also aiming to make this book multilingual, for two main reasons: 
1) We want Pepito's journey to be accessible to children all over the 
world, not just in English-speaking countries, and 2) exposing children 
to foreign languages at an early age helps them gain an interest in 
other cultures, which helps them develop the ideas of empathy and 
cooperation.  These go well with the other values presented in this 
book, and are especially helpful in our modern global world. Our base 
goal is for English and German, and we are working with a Japanese 
translator. Perhaps another language could be added if there is
 enough space and interest. We will keep you up-to-date on any 
developments.
Unser
 Ziel ist es, das Buch mehrsprachig heraus zu geben. Das hat mehrere 
Gründe, zum einem kann so Pepitos Geschichte in vielen Ländern gelesen 
und verstanden werden, zum anderen lernen Kinder 
von klein auf, dass es verschiedene Sprachen und Kulturen gibt, deren 
Unterschiedlichkeit wertfrei und selbstverständlich ist. Das ist in der 
globalen Welt von heute sicher von Vorteil. Im 
Moment gibt es die geschichte auf deutsch und englisch, eine japanische 
Übersetzung ist in Planung, auch andere Sprachen können hinzu gefügt 
werden, je nach Platz und Interesse. Wir halten Sie über die Entwicklung auf dem Laufenden,
私は、次に挙げます二つの理由でこの絵本を多国語で出版したいと考えています。まず一つ目は、英語圏だけでなく、世界中の子ども達にペピー
トの冒険を楽しんでもらいたいと思っています。そして二つ目は、子ども達には早くから外国語に触れる機会を与え、自国とは異なる文化に興味を持ち、他者に
対する共感や、協調性を養う事に役立ててほしいと思うからです。

以上二点は、この絵本から学んでもらいたい他の大切な価値観とともに、子ども達がグローバル化が進む現代社会を生きていくために、非常に役立つものだと考
えます。　先ずは、英語、ドイツ語で出版する事が目標ですが、現在、日本語への翻訳も検討中です。賛同・支援して下さる方がいれば、その他の言語への翻訳
も検討したいと思っております。当プロジェクトの進展については、随時ご報告申し上げます。
What We Need
Was wir brauchen
皆様のご支援のお願い
Land
 of Hope has already been fully written, and we are already working with
 a German publishing company, S. Fischer Verlage, to get it out into the
 world. They have given us a price estimate of 7,000 Euro as an absolute
 minimum for production. It's a greater amount than we can afford to pay
 out-of-pocket, which is 
why we are turning to you for help! Every dollar or euro counts. 
Das

 Land der Hoffnung ist bereits fertig geschrieben, und wir sind in 
Kontakt mit einem deutschen Verlagshaus (S. Fischer Verlage). Dort hat 
man uns einen Mindestpreis von 7 500 € für Druck und Vertrieb genannt. 
Leider fehlt uns das nötige geld, so wenden wir uns an Sie - jeder noch 
so kleine Betrag hilft. 
「希望の国」の原稿は、既に出来上がっており、ドイツの出版社、S. Fischer 
Verlageから、絵本を世に送りだす準備を進めています。しかし、出版には、最低でも7,000ユーロの出資を要します。これは、私が個人的に用意で
きる金額を上回るものです。そのため、ぜひ皆様のご支援を頂ければと、今回お願いしております次第です。ご賛同いただきご支援を賜ることができましたら幸
いです。
However,
 our ultimate goal is €13,000 - that would cover editing, printing, 
production, grade-A advertisement, shipping and distribution to 
bookstores around the country, and would also upgrade the book into a 
larger, more child-friendly format. We've read the statistics on 
successful crowdfunding projects and know that a lower number is easier 
to reach, so we're hoping your generosity will go above and beyond our 
minimum goal to help us reach €13,000.
Das
 ultimative Ziel sind 13 000 €, was ausser Druck und allen damit 
verbundenen Kosten wie Versand und Vertrieb eine Top-Grade-A- 
Werbeaktion mit einschliesst. Das Buch könnte so 
auch ein etwas größeres, kinderfreundlicheres Format bekommen. Wir haben
 uns über erfolgreiche Crowdfunding-Projekte informiert und hoffen sehr,
 dass wir es schaffen, die optimale Summe zu erzielen. 
上記の金額は、出版に最低限必要な額であり、編集、印刷、製本、広告、発送、国内外への書籍流通・販売、そして、子ども達にとって親しみや
すい大きめのサイズ、読みやすいフォーマットにするなど、多少の工夫を加えますと、必要経費は13,000ユーロ程度になると概算しております。目標金額
を低めに設定したほうがプロジェクトの成功率が高いという統計を目にしたこともありますが、わたし達としましても、皆様の温かいご支援をいただき、子ども
達のためにより質の高い絵本を届けることができるよう、努力を惜しまない所存です。
Even if you can't 
contribute monetarily to Land of Hope, you can still help us out by 
spreading the word to anyone who may be interested! Sharing, emailing, 
tweeting, and word-of-mouth are absolutely invaluable to getting this 
project off the ground.
Wenn
 Sie im Moment finanziell nicht helfen können, freuen wir uns, wenn Sie 
helfen, indem Sie andere auf das Projekt aufmerksam machen, die 
vielleicht helfen können. Soziale Netzwerke, Emails, Kaffeklasch, 
Mundpropaganda, all dies trägt dazu bei, das Projekt zu verwirklichen. 
「希
望の国」に金銭的なご支援を頂けない場合でも、是非、このプロジェクトの事をお知り合いの方々へ伝えていただけたら幸いです。　情報のシェアリング、E
メールやツイッターを介して、又は、直接お話して頂くだけでも、このプロジェクトの実現に向けて非常にありがたい支援となります。
 This book is perfect for parents of young
 children, expecting parents, or even aunts, uncles, grandparents, and 
other relatives searching for a gift for the young ones in their lives. 
Dieses
 Buch ist ein schönes Geschenk für Eltern kleiner Kinder, also Eltern, 
Tanten, Onkel, Omas und Opas, Familie und Freunde- hier ist ein Geschenk

Predicted Timeline
Zeitplan
想定タイムライン
So, how long is this all going to take? 
So, wann wird was passieren?
このプロジェクトのタイムスケジュールは、どの様なものでしょうか。
In a perfect world, the timeline would look something like this:
Wenn alles klappt, sieht der Plan aus wie folgt:
想定しているタイムスケジュールは、以下の通りです。
October 31st, 2014: Crowdfunding begins!
Mid-December
 2014: Crowdfunding ends, all funds calculated, collected, and sent to 
publishers. Digital perks sent to supporters - just in time for the 
holidays!
January 2015: Publishing company begins production process for Land of Hope
Summer 2015: Printing is completed, books sent to Horacio and later distributed to bookstores
Summer/Fall 2015: Physical rewards shipped out to supporters, arriving once again just in time for the holidays!
31. Oktober 2014: das Crowdfunding beginnt!
Mitte Dezenber 2014: das Crowdfunding endet, alle Spenden gehen an den 
Verlag, die digitalen Perks (Belohnungen)  gehen an die Spender, 
pünktlich zum Weihnachtsfest!
Januar 2015: der Verlag beginnt die Produktion.
Sommer 2015: der Druck ist fertig, die Bücher werden versendet und an Buchläden verschickt.
Sommer/Herbst 2015: alle nicht-digitalen Perks , d.h. alle Geschenke werden verschickt, pünktlich zum nächsten Fest!
2014年10月31日：クラウドファンディング開始！
2014年12月中旬：クラウドファンディング終了。支援額の計算、出版社に送金。支援者への特典中、ネット上送信できるものは、クリスマス前にお届けします！
2015年1月：出版社「希望の国」絵本制作開始
2015年夏期：印刷・製本終了。オーラシオの手元に本が届けられ、いよいよ書店流通へ。
2015年夏・秋期：デジタル以外の特典を支援者様へ郵送。
Realistically, we know lots of things could happen to 
delay this process. If the crowdfuding isn't as successful as we hope, 
it may take some extra time to scrape up the last bit of money needed to
 pay the publishers. Printing may take longer than expected at the 
publishers, and mailing speeds can sometimes be unpredictable, 
especially internationally and around holidays. We can't know ahead of 
time what might happen, but we promise to keep you informed of all 
updates, good and bad, as soon as we find out about them. 
Es können immer Dinge passieren, die den Ablauf verzögern. Wenn z.B. das
 Crowdfunding nicht den gewünschten Erfolg hat. kann es noch
 dauern, bis wir den Rest zusammen gekratzt haben. Der Druck kann läner 
dauern, Versandzeiten können abweichen (vor allem international). Falls 
eine Verzögerung eintritt, werden alle benachrichtigt sobald wir davon 
Kenntnis haben.
以上は、あくまでも想定しているタイムラインであり、現実的には、様々な原因でプロセスに遅れが出る可能性が考えられます。例えば、当キャ
ンペーン中に集められた支援金が目標額を下回った場合、残りの必要な額を集めて出版社に送金するのに時間がかかったり、印刷が予想以上に長引いたり、郵
送、特にホリデー・シーズン中の海外郵送に時間がかかる事など考えられます。このの様な状況に変更があり次第、責任を持って皆様に随時ご報告致します。
How it Will Look
Wie wird das Buch aussehen?
完成した絵本
We are envisioning our book to be approximately 22 x 1 x 30
 centimeters. Each turn of the page will reveal a beautiful photograph 
from the Land of Hope tapestry, with a corresponding text (in at least 
two languages) on the other side that tells Pepito's story. Small 
sketches of the little man in various poses will appear alongside the 
text.
Wir planen das Buch in der Größe 22
 x 1 x 30 cm. Bei jedem Umblättern sieht man eine neue Seite mit einem 
Bildausschenitt des Werkes ""Land der Hoffnung"" zeigen mit den dazu 
gehörigen Texten in mindestens zwei Sprachen auf der gegenüberliegenden 
Seite. Kleine Zeichnungen des kleinen Pepito ergänzen das Bild.
完成した絵本は、22cm x 1cm x 30cm 
程のサイズを考えています。各ページを開くと、そこには、「希望の国」刺繍のタペストリーの美しい写真が広がり、それにあわせて少なくとも2つ以上の言語
でペピートのお話しを描きます。文章の隣には、かわいらしいペピートが様々なポーズで現れます。

One of our draft pages. So far, this only has the German text, and 
the height isn't exactly right. As soon as we have an updated version of
 this, we will let you know! See below for the English and Japanese translations that 
will be on this page: Hier ein Beispiel, erstmal nur mit dem deutschen Text und vorläufigem Format. Der englische Text folgt:

絵本の中のあるページのドラフトです。ここでは、皆さまに絵本のイメージをお伝えするために見本としてドイツ語の本文を入れてあります。本のサイズ少々完成版と異なります。校正したものができましたら改めて掲載します。下記に日本語の仮訳を掲載しましたのでご覧ください。
'To his great surprise Pepito met a man who was even smaller then he was.
Pepito said to him: “How can you be happy being so very small?”
And the small man answered: “Because I see that life is full of treasures like this pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.”
“Yes”, said Pepito, “I see. But I want to be big.”
“Good,"" said the small man, “then you must respect all persons 
whether they are smaller or bigger than you; then you will be big. Come 
with me to the pond for a drink.”'

ペピートはびっくりして目を丸くしました。

ここには、僕より小さい住人がいたなんて！
「どうしてそんなに小さくても幸せでいられるの？」ペピートは、尋ねました。
「それは、この虹の果てにある黄金の壷の様な宝ものが、人生には、たくさんあるからだよ。」と応えました。
「へぇ。そうなんだ。」「でもね、ぼくは、大きくなりたいんだ。」
「そうか。」その小さな住人は言いました。「それなら、自分より大きい人でも、小さい人でも、誰に対しても敬意をもって接することだな。そうしたら君は大きくなれるさ。ほら、一緒に池のほうにいって何か飲もうじゃないか。」Perks

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Rise From the Ashes: Stories of Trauma, Resilience, and Growth From the Children of 9/11</i> is a book about how 9/11 surviving children found triumph from tragedy, and how you can, too. <br/><br/>My name is Payton Lynch, and I am the author of Rise From the Ashes: Stories of trauma, resilience, and growth from the children of 9/11. I was inspired to write this book by my husband’s story as a 9/11 surviving child. When my husband was 13 years old, his father, Robert Henry Lynch Jr, ran back into the World Trade Center to save others’ lives. This loss at such a young age has had a profound impact on my husband’s life. As 2020 brought unique challenges and, for me, the biggest challenges of my life thus far, I wanted to understand why my husband seemed better equipped to cope than I was. I began speaking with other 9/11 surviving children like him and found that many of them share a common resilience. Their stories taught me how to better cope with my current challenges, something all who experience grief and trauma could benefit from. <br/><br/>Many of us remember where we were when 9/11 happened. Few people can say that they know someone personally impacted. As a wife of someone who felt that personal impact, the loss has shaped my world in significant ways. In this way, I can provide an insider view not only of what many 9/11 Surviving Children experienced and continue to experience but how this has led to endless ripple effects amongst all those that they interact with. In doing so, I hope to show others that even in the midst of great tragedy, there is hope, and where there is hope, there is life and promise for the future.<br/><br/>This book explores the intersections of 9/11, the trauma and triumph that resulted from this event, and how others can move past their own grief as well.<br/><br/>This book includes stories and insights from 9/11 Surviving Children such as my husband, Jonathan Lynch, comedian Pete Davidson, WWE Wrestler Zelina Vega, and activists Halley, Madison, and Anna Clare Burnett. It also features conversations with licensed counselors such as Stacie Boyar, who work with victims of other tragedies such as the mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School. <br/><br/>My hope for this book is that it’s not just a look back at 9/11, but a glimpse into how the people affected by an enormous tragedy pick up the pieces and move forward. The 9/11 Surviving Children are living proof that all of us can tap into our best selves even after, and sometimes because of grief and trauma. While you may not have been personally affected by 9/11, the lessons they have to share, apply to all of us encountering challenges. In hearing their stories, my hope is that we discover what it means to bounce forward after tragedy and recognize that our past doesn’t define us, but it definitely shapes us.<br/><br/>One of the most touching stories I share in this book is about Nicole Foster. Today, Nicole is a certified health and wellness coach and gets to use all she’s learned about wellness from her own trials, tragedy, grief, and trauma to help others. Nicole was 5 when her dad passed away during 9/11. To make matters more difficult, just before her 15th birthday, Nicole was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Today, Nicole is cancer-free. In the book, she shares how she employed many practices and techniques that she attributes to her ability to beat the disease. <br/><br/><i>Rise From the Ashes: Stories of Trauma, Resilience, and Growth from the Children of 9/11</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to anyone who has experienced or is experiencing hard times. You will love this book if you are someone looking to learn about 9/11 from a new perspective. This book is also for anyone who is encountering their own grief or trauma and would benefit from the hope that these 9/11 surviving children bring us. <br/> <h2>The Book - Rise From the Ashes: Stories of Trauma, Resilience, and Growth from the Children of 9/11</h2>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters [1-13]. In this section, you will hear from 9/11 Surviving Children about their experiences on the day of 9/11 and their cherished memories with their lost parent. This section will also include background and insights from myself, Payton Lynch, on how 9/11 and other tragedy has impacted my life.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters [14-26]. In this section, 9/11 Surviving Children will recall what the most traumatic moments following 9/11 were for them, including insights from my husband who struggled to get the support he needed. This section also includes analysis from myself, counselors, and scientists on how trauma impacts us. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters [27-38]. In this section, we learn how 9/11 Surviving Children were able to turn their trauma into triumph, uncovering the lessons and practical skills they have to share. This section also includes stories from my own personal journey and how I’ve applied what I’ve learned from 9/11 Surviving Children to my own life.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.</li>
<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Summer.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.</p>
<p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.</li>
<li>Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</li>

<li>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.</li>
<li>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</li>
</ul>
<p>And much more!</p>
<h2>About the Author</h2>Payton Lynch is a Product Manager at The Walt Disney Company. As a child and young adult, Disney’s storytelling became an important part of her life, teaching to engage audiences. In her career, she tells stories through the magic of Guest engagement. <br/><br/>Payton has been crafting stories for as long as she can remember, but in 2020 she decided to take the plunge and dedicate herself to writing her first book. <br/><br/>Payton’s first book is inspired by her husband and his story as a 9/11 Surviving Child. His story is one of 3,000 stories (not including the 2,000 adult-age people who lost a parent that day and the countless others who have gone on to lose a parent due to 9/11 illnesses) that need to be told. Payton is grateful to Jon and the many others she’s interviewed who have been so willing to share their stories in hopes of helping others. <br/><br/>When Payton isn’t writing, you can find her playing in the Disney parks or traveling in her Airstream with her husband, Jon. The couple has two sweet dogs, Snowgie and Rex, who come with them on all of their adventures. Their travels have inspired their Couple Meets World vlog on Instagram and Youtube. Despite all they share together, Payton and Jon still feel that their family isn’t complete and hopes that you’ll keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they navigate infertility together. <br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Payton Lynch at paytonmeetsworld@gmail.com and on Instagram @paytonmeetsworld. <br/> <h2>International Preorders</h2>For international preorders, please send me a private message.<br/> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>

<h3>Moria - Europas største og værste flygtningelejr</h3>
<p>Igennem fem år har jeg besøgt Europas største flygtningelejr, Moria på den græske ø Lesbos. Den 8. September 2020 brændte lejren ned og efterlod 13.000 mennesker - heraf 4.000 børn - hjemløse. </p>
<p>Jeg vil gennem billeder og vidnesbyrd fortælle historien om lejren der siden flygtningekrisens start i 2015 har stået som symbol på EU's forfejlede samarbejde og mistede kerneværdier som medmenneskelighed og fællesskab.  </p>
<p>Da jeg besøgte i lejren i 2019 boede der 20.000 mennesker under horrible forhold. Mangel på rent vand, ordentlige sanitære forhold, ingen skole og hyppige overfald gjorde Moria til én af de værste lejre i verden. </p>
<p>Igennem unikke fotos, mine øjenviden beretninger og især vidnesbyrd fra beboerne og de mennesker der har arbejdet som læger og sygeplejersker i lejren vil jeg gerne skabe et dokument for eftertiden, så vi ikke glemmer hvad der skete i årene 2015-2020, hvor Moria eksisterede. <br/><br/>Bogen vil blive udgivet på årsdagen for branden i Morialejren - den 8. september 2021.<br/> </p>

<h3><strong>Min baggrund</strong></h3>
<p>Jeg er dokumentarist og har instrueret en række film om flygtningeproblematikker - bl.a. ""Drømmen om Danmark"" der fik premiere på CPH:DOX og DR1 og vandt Best Feature Documentary på Chicago International Film Festival og Amnesty Award på Giffoni i Italien. </p>
<p>Jeg skrev i 2019 ""De uledsagedes bog"" med Mads Nygaard - 10 beretninger om uledsagede flygtningebørn. Bogen vandt Benny Andersen Prisen i 2020 og mine billeder er bl.a. blevet udgivet i Al Jazeera, Zetland og Politiken. <br/><br/>Jeg har desuden deltaget i den offentlige debat i DR2 Debatten, P1 Debat, Information, Berlingske, Politiken, JyllandsPosten m.fl. og senest har Baglandet på P1 fulgt mit arbejde på Lesbos i serien ""Det gode menneske"". <br/><br/>- Michael Graversen, forfatter og dokumentarist<br/> </p>

<h3>
<br/><strong>Hvad har vi brug for?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Vi har brug for at rejse minimum 20.000 kroner til at trykke bogen.<br/><br/>Da ét af de bærende elementer er fotos betyder det at trykkeomkostningerne er høje. Vi har fået støtte fra forskellige steder - bl.a. Mellemfolkelig Samvirke - men uden bidrag via denne crowdfunding bliver projektet ikke realiseret.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Hvad får du ud af at støtte?</strong></h3>
<p>Jeg tilbyder en signeret bog, filmvisning og foredrag alt afhængig af hvor meget man donerer.<br/><br/>Men det største bidrag er man bidrager til oplysning om mennesker i nød og et værk der forhåbentlig bliver relevant for eftertiden.<br/><br/>Bogen vil blive fulgt op af en PR og oplysningskampagne med den erfarne PR konsulent Line Bilenberg og skabe fundament for en offentlig debat.<br/> </p>

Igennem fem år har jeg besøgt Europas største flygtningelejr, Moria på den græske ø Lesbos. Den 8. September 2020 brændte lejren ned og efterlod 13.000 mennesker - heraf 4.000 børn - hjemløse. 
Jeg vil gennem billeder og vidnesbyrd fortælle historien om lejren der siden flygtningekrisens start i 2015 har stået som symbol på EU's forfejlede samarbejde og mistede kerneværdier som medmenneskelighed og fællesskab.  
Da jeg besøgte i lejren i 2019 boede der 20.000 mennesker under horrible forhold. Mangel på rent vand, ordentlige sanitære forhold, ingen skole og hyppige overfald gjorde Moria til én af de værste lejre i verden. 
Igennem unikke fotos, mine øjenviden beretninger og især vidnesbyrd fra beboerne og de mennesker der har arbejdet som læger og sygeplejersker i lejren vil jeg gerne skabe et dokument for eftertiden, så vi ikke glemmer hvad der skete i årene 2015-2020, hvor Moria eksisterede. Bogen vil blive udgivet på årsdagen for branden i Morialejren - den 8. september 2021. 
 
Min baggrund
Jeg er dokumentarist og har instrueret en række film om flygtningeproblematikker - bl.a. ""Drømmen om Danmark"" der fik premiere på CPH:DOX og DR1 og vandt Best Feature Documentary på Chicago International Film Festival og Amnesty Award på Giffoni i Italien. 
Jeg skrev i 2019 ""De uledsagedes bog"" med Mads Nygaard - 10 beretninger om uledsagede flygtningebørn. Bogen vandt Benny Andersen Prisen i 2020 og mine billeder er bl.a. blevet udgivet i Al Jazeera, Zetland og Politiken. Jeg har desuden deltaget i den offentlige debat i DR2 Debatten, P1 Debat, Information, Berlingske, Politiken, JyllandsPosten m.fl. og senest har Baglandet på P1 fulgt mit arbejde på Lesbos i serien ""Det gode menneske"". - Michael Graversen, forfatter og dokumentarist 


 

Forlaget
Forlaget Jensen & Dalgaard udgiver bogen. Det er et forlag, som udgiver kvalitetslitteratur indenfor alle genrer og på alle platforme. 
""Jensen & Dalgaard udgiver Skønlitteratur / Faglitteratur om samfund og eksistens / Billedbøger / Børne- og ungdomsbøger ... og diverse afstikkere, når vi simpelthen ikke kan lade være.
Vi udgiver de bøger, vi selv holder af - og håber, at andre synes det samme. Og så holder vi meget af at producere bøger, man skal stå lidt på tæer for - vi tror nemlig, det er sundt at få strakt og rørt både tæer og hjerneceller."" - Jensen&Dalgaardwww.jensenogdalgaard.dk 


Hvad har vi brug for?

Vi har brug for at rejse minimum 20.000 kroner til at trykke bogen.Da ét af de bærende elementer er fotos betyder det at trykkeomkostningerne er høje. Vi har fået støtte fra forskellige steder - bl.a. Mellemfolkelig Samvirke - men uden bidrag via denne crowdfunding bliver projektet ikke realiseret. 
Hvad får du ud af at støtte?
Jeg tilbyder en signeret bog, filmvisning og foredrag alt afhængig af hvor meget man donerer.Men det største bidrag er man bidrager til oplysning om mennesker i nød og et værk der forhåbentlig bliver relevant for eftertiden.Bogen vil blive fulgt op af en PR og oplysningskampagne med den erfarne PR konsulent Line Bilenberg og skabe fundament for en offentlig debat.",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h1>STEP RIGHT UP</h1><p>Greetings! I am J. Tithonus Pednaud and for nearly a decade
I’ve dedicated much of my time to preserving and presenting the remarkable
tribulations and triumphs of those born exceedingly different. </p>
<p>Call them Freaks, Geeks, Human Oddities or even Monsters,
but to me they will always be Human Marvels. Believe it or not their lives are
even more extraordinary than you can imagine, and even more astonishing than their
outward appearances.</p>
<p>You see, many of these <i>freaks</i>
found fortune, love, family and fame during their lives due to people like you
– the inquisitive and curious. My website chronicles these stories and pulls
back the curtain on the private lives of human curiosities.</p>
<p>It’s time for me to write a <b>book</b> featuring these incredible
human beings.</p>

character really faces. If the novel is well written and you are really
absorbed in it, your intellectual guard is relaxed and you are more receptive
to the views of the fictional characters.  I hope The Christmas Special will help readers
see the world through the eyes’ of others and ultimately help make our divisive

I think fiction has the power to bring about
social change because it helps people see various sides of issues. The voices
of fictional characters often help people develop empathy for other people who
are locked in what is first viewed as strange beliefs. Fiction gives you a
chance to walk in someone else’s’ shoes without the danger and hardship the
character really faces. If the novel is well written and you are really
absorbed in it, your intellectual guard is relaxed and you are more receptive
to the views of the fictional characters.  I hope The Christmas Special will help readers

world a little bit better.

THIS STORY IS JEWISH TOO ...</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Surviving the Soviet ‘Paradise’… an astonishing story of the incredible journey made by thousands of homeless wanderers, Polish citizens of different nationalities, thrust cruelly from their Polish homes during the period of 1939 - 1942. This journey led them through the hell of Siberia, GULag, the empty steppes of Kazakhstan, through the so-called “amnesty” for innocent exiles in 1941. This project will attempt to capture the despair of endless hope, hunger, death and pain. It will trace their journey through Middle Asia, via Buzuluk, Tockoje, Karaganda, Jangi-Jul, Tashkent, Krasnowodsk, Pahlavi, Iran…</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Polish Jews constituted the largest percentage of the six million exterminated by Nazis during World War II. This fact is widely known. But huge number of Polish Jews, <b>approximately 300,000 of them</b>, experienced both Nazi and Soviet atrocities, between 1939 and 1942. This story begins with the The Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, signed in August 1939, two weeks before WWII started. In a secret protocol of that pact, Poland was divided into two parts; western, to be occupied by Nazis, and eastern, to be occupied by Soviets. Germany invaded Poland on September 1st and occupied its western part. Soviets invaded two weeks later and grabbed the rest of the territories.The process of partition was mostly accomplished before the end of September. Some areas of Poland were initially occupied by Nazis but then returned to Soviets, after border adjustment negotiations. Many Polish Jews escaped to the Soviet zone, after experiencing German atrocities. But in the eyes of Soviet authorities most of them were class enemies ... and treated accordingly. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">About 300,000 Polish Jews were deported to Siberia, together with even larger number of ethnic Polish citizens, mostly in 1940. Conditions in Siberian settlements were so horrible that between 30% and 50% of the deportees died there in the first year. What saved the rest of them was the amnesty to all Polish citizens, declared by the Soviets in September 1941. They were allowed to form an army and finally managed to escape USSR. This resulted from intense negotiations between the Soviet Union and the Polish Government in Exile (in London). Stalin could not yet be certain of the Soviet victory and desperately needed Western allies. The released people were allowed to join ranks of a Polish Army formed in the USSR and subsequently to fight Germans “from the back,” under British command. <b>Menachem Begin</b>, who later became the Prime Minister of Israel, was among the Jewish survivors of Soviet death camps. <b>The total Jewish population of Poland was 3.3 million, before the Second World War started. Only 350,000 survived. About 250,000 of survivors were those who were deported to Siberia</b> ...</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">More than 70 years after these events I am planning to walk in their footsteps and shadows in the autumn of 2013. Equipped only with my press pass, video camera, a handful of contacts and my knowledge, experience and enthusiasm I am planning to travel from Buzuluk, through Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan to Iran, where the story begins again. I want to visit places already forgotten. Talk to those who remember. Visit the graves that haven’t been visited for decades. The documentary, reported and published live via the internet using video footage and commentary will result in a moving homage to those who made it though this largely forgotten odyssey.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Already, media patronage has been declared by Polskapresse Editions, Polish Editor, publisher of influential “Polska – The Times” newspaper (in cooperation with British “The Times” daily) and a number of local Polish dailies and newspapers. This project also received support from ""The Culture"" Literary Institute from Paris. Live coverage from this journey will be also available online at Wiadomosci24.pl newsportal.

In March 2013 I was awarded with “Journalist of the Year 2012” Award by Polskapresse Editions. This comes as a big honor and distinction for me.

I have been also working as a researcher for many years.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am a freelancer journalist, reporter and writer, co-operating in the past and now with a number of Polish and foreign newspapers and multimedia editors – i.e. “Kurier Wilenski”, Polskapresse Editions, Wiadomosci24.pl newsportal, Polish TV, Institute for National Remembrance, Interia.pl news portal, Radio “Wnet” among others.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am also the author of documentary novels and movies.

Jewish part of this history is one of the principals. Those “tokens of remembrance” consist in part of visits to the cemeteries throughout Russia, Asia and Iran, recording conversations with locals, visiting places of army gatherings and so on. An important part of this documentary will be the archival research that I want to conduct in every visited place.

<p style=""font-size: 22px;"">“Family Wakes Us Up” started out as letters between expectant fathers. Now it’s becoming a book. And – we hope – the beginning of a broader conversation about the spirituality of family life.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">My name is Matthew.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">About a year and a half ago, Michael Stone and I found out that we were sharing a story of second chances. We learned that our partners were pregnant. We knew we needed support. Not logistical advice or slaps on the back. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/167087/files/20131031143224-baby.png?1383255144"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>We were looking for something our culture rarely encourages, especially amongst expectant fathers: emotional transparency. We thought that if we could be as open with each other as possible – about our expectations, past challenges, regrets, anxieties, and joys – we’d really be able to see what we’re made of, and what all of our years of spiritual practice had actually given us.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">We wanted to see how yoga, meditation, and Ayurveda really fit into the most important journeys of our personal lives. What have we really learned on the mat, on the cushion, in the kitchen, through divorce, through previous and ongoing family commitments? Where do we hurt? What are we blind to? What hidden strengths can we show each other?</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">We began writing to each other to explore our lives and to offer support to each other. We couldn't stop. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">Our letters reflect how deeply interwoven our life-stories are, but as we’ve shared them with others, we’ve been shown that they’re resonant with a broader cultural need. We’d write to each other at dawn -- from home, on the road for work --  pouring out all the juice: memory, fear, sex, wonderment, and the beauty, bravery, and fatigue of our partners. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">I think we’ve shone a light on a tender process, too often hidden. There are over sixty letters now, which we're editing. <a href=""http://matthewremski.com/wordpress/family-wakes-us-up-by-michael-stone-and-matthew-remski-first-published-excerpt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">You can read the first four here, posted on my blog</a>.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">This campaign has two objectives. As a simple pre-ordering system (see the rewards!), we’ll raise the money we need to present our work through an independent publishing platform. Secondly, the campaign will allow us to pay some bills during brief sabbaticals of intensive revising, paying our network of readers and editors, and paying our design team. </p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">The farther reach of our campaign will help us build and maintain <a href=""http://www.familywakesusup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.familywakesusup.com</a> -- where we will collect and curate the best writing on the spirituality of family life that we can find. Our goal is to publish that collection eighteen months after our own book comes to print.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">After that? Who knows! We feel it’s time for a new conversation about family life. We’re happy with this effort to start it, and we’re excited to see where it goes.</p></span><p><font color=""#444444""><span style=""line-height: 28px;""></span></font></p>

<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">The rewards are ideal for individuals, family members, independent booksellers, yoga studios, and meditation centres.

</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","“Family Wakes Us Up” started out as letters between expectant fathers. Now it’s becoming a book. And – we hope – the beginning of a broader conversation about the spirituality of family life.
""...this book is not only about these two men becoming fathers, but rather discussing the spirituality and mindfulness, and the deep layers that go along with it.  Something EVERYONE could benefit from."" - First Time Mom & Dad


My name is Matthew.
About a year and a half ago, Michael Stone and I found out that we were sharing a story of second chances. We learned that our partners were pregnant. We knew we needed support. Not logistical advice or slaps on the back. 
We were looking for something our culture rarely encourages, especially amongst expectant fathers: emotional transparency. We thought that if we could be as open with each other as possible – about our expectations, past challenges, regrets, anxieties, and joys – we’d really be able to see what we’re made of, and what all of our years of spiritual practice had actually given us.
We wanted to see how yoga, meditation, and Ayurveda really fit into the most important journeys of our personal lives. What have we really learned on the mat, on the cushion, in the kitchen, through divorce, through previous and ongoing family commitments? Where do we hurt? What are we blind to? What hidden strengths can we show each other?
We began writing to each other to explore our lives and to offer support to each other. We couldn't stop. 
Our letters reflect how deeply interwoven our life-stories are, but as we’ve shared them with others, we’ve been shown that they’re resonant with a broader cultural need. We’d write to each other at dawn -- from home, on the road for work --  pouring out all the juice: memory, fear, sex, wonderment, and the beauty, bravery, and fatigue of our partners. 
I think we’ve shone a light on a tender process, too often hidden. There are over sixty letters now, which we're editing. You can read the first four here, posted on my blog.

Blog889 - Letters from Family Wakes Us Up






This campaign has two objectives. As a simple pre-ordering system (see the rewards!), we’ll raise the money we need to present our work through an independent publishing platform. Secondly, the campaign will allow us to pay some bills during brief sabbaticals of intensive revising, paying our network of readers and editors, and paying our design team. 
The farther reach of our campaign will help us build and maintain www.familywakesusup.com -- where we will collect and curate the best writing on the spirituality of family life that we can find. Our goal is to publish that collection eighteen months after our own book comes to print.
After that? Who knows! We feel it’s time for a new conversation about family life. We’re happy with this effort to start it, and we’re excited to see where it goes.


If we raise $25,000 ($5000 more than our initial goal), we will record an audio book of the letters in a professional studio, and every contributor to the campaign will receive a download.

Rewards for contributors are listed down the side panel. They consist of copies of the book itself in various formats and quantities -- including wholesale quantities -- and private consultation sessions with either myself or Michael, or both of us. 
The rewards are ideal for individuals, family members, independent booksellers, yoga studios, and meditation centres. The wholesale quantity rewards can also be useful for reading groups, or for those who would like to sponsor bulk orders for birth preparation classes, midwifery clinics, and doula trainings. 
As fundraisers, we have a strong track record of coming through on both goals and commitments. We have both headed successful non-profit organizations, and my last book was also fully funded by an Indiegogo campaign in the summer of 2012.

<p><b>What Makes Veteran Different
From Other Magazines?</b></p>
<p>From past experiences, getting information from multiple sources
is easier said than done, especially if you are a particular reader, such as a veteran.
It's difficult because you want it to relate to something that you care about,
i.e. education for veterans, job assistance for veterans, seeking help for
veterans, and fun things like sports and outdoors for veterans. Veterans want articles
that pertain to duty, honor, respect, integrity, leadership, and most of all camaraderie.
Articles such as veterans that have succeeded outside the military, interesting
stories on veterans that have served, and articles on colleges that best serve
veterans are but a few of the many things that veterans want to read in
magazines, and they want it ALL IN ONE. This is something that is simply not in other magazines. If anything
like this is offered with other magazines, it's a special issue commemorating
Veterans Day and other military holidays. Veteran will be a special issue every
issue, providing meaningful information that can be used as a tool for the future
success of a veteran.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What Is Our Mission?</b></p>
<p>Veteran will be a hard cover and digital magazine that encompasses the need to know from businesses, organizations, and media sources, into an ALL IN ONE military style read that veterans want. Our mission is to share and create valid, meaningful, fun, and interesting articles on various topics with veterans in mind, such as veteran health &amp; wellness, veteran employment tips, financial advice for veterans, technology that helps veterans, counsel for veterans (mental, physical, &amp; spiritual, to include legal counseling tips), universities that best serve veterans across the nation, veteran spotlights, and travel destinations for veterans are but a few of the many articles we will provide.</p>

<p>Hi, I am Karen, Camila’s mom. We live in La Paz, Bolivia.</p>
<p>Camila is twelve years old and at the age of two, she was
diagnosed with a ‘porencephalic cyst on the left temporo parietal side’
following a stroke at birth. As a consequence Camila has epilepsy and
hemiplegia, which affected the right side of her body. She has been having
continual seizures since then. </p>
<p>Yet despite the challenges she has endured, multiple tests
at hospitals, debilitating effects after each seizure and the countless
sessions of physiotherapy to gain strength and mobility in her right side,
Camila always has a smile on her face.</p>
<p>By the age of four, Camila was having twenty seizures a
day, which prevented her from attending a formal school. This situation prompted
me to create an educational community for her and for children like her.  </p>
<p></p>
<a href=""http://vocesvitalesbolivia.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vocesvitalesbolivia.blogspot.com</a><br/><a href=""http://google.com/+KarenFloresPalacios"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">google.com/+KarenFloresPalacios</a><p></p>
<p>Since her diagnosis, Camila has been on multiple medications
which unfortunately have failed to control the seizures. After having done
everything possible in Bolivia, in 2007 we decided to take her to the Miami Children's
Hospital for a comprehensive evaluation. 
The studies determined that her epilepsy was resistance to medications,
but she was candidate for a resective brain surgery. Thank God there was hope, at
least a path of light.</p>
<p>Epilepsy brain surgery is not offered in Bolivia.  So, during these years, we have been saving
money for the surgery and Camila has been taking three epilepsy drugs. Miraculously,
her seizures have decreased and we hoped that the surgery would not be
necessary.</p>
<p>In September 2014, we took her back to the Miami Children's Hospital. But our hopes were shattered when they informed us that her
condition was a little more complicated. According to the medical exams her
seizures are now affecting the right side of the brain and there is a risk that
the seizures can turn into generalized seizures and affect the whole
brain. </p>
<p>The brain surgery is needed now more than
ever. Her last evaluation at Miami Children’s Hospital says that she is a
candidate for hemispherectomy surgery and disconnection of the damaged
left hemisphere. This new situation means that we need to act quickly and we
need more resources. We are aware of the risks associated with this kind of
surgery, but we know that God is on our side.</p>
<p>The team at Miami Children’s Hospital believe that the
surgery has a 90% chance of curing her seizures. You can imagine how magical
this would be for Camila. She is a beautiful girl and a loving daughter. She
loves dancing, jumping, singing and her dream is to become a fashion and jewellery
designer. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Please support Camila in having this
operation in USA. The goal is
ambitious, so any donations big or small are so much appreciated. Please share
this page, far and wide, to all your friends, colleagues, and family. Updates
on our fundraising efforts will be shared on this page.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for
giving Camila a chance to start a new life.</p>

Hola, soy Karen mamá de Camila. Ella tiene 12 años. A los dos años le diagnosticaron un quiste porencefálico ubicado en el lado temporo parietal izquierdo, como consecuencia de un infarto cerebral.

El 2007 fuimos al Miami Children´s Hospital y nos informaron que por la condición de farmacoresistente, Camila era candidata a una cirugía resectiva en el cebrebro. Gracias a Dios había un camino de luz y esperanza.
Durante estos años, y para tener tiempo de conseguir los fondos económicos, ella estuvo controlada con tres medicamentos. Milagrosamente las convulsiones disminuyeron. 
En septiembre de 2014, la llevamos nuevamente al Hospital de Miami, con la esperanza de que nos dijeran que no era necesaria la cirugía o que podíamos esperar. Pero lamentablemente no fue así. La situación de Camila se complicó un poco más, porque de acuerdo a un electroencefalograma, la parte enferma del cerebro, está contaminando al lado derecho; es decir, al lado sano.
Esto implica que la cirugía de Camila ya no sería resectiva; sino una hemisferoctomía, que supone más tiempo, más recursos y algo más de riesgo. Pero, sabemos que Dios está de nuestro lado.
 Por eso recurrimos a su ayuda solidaria, cada centavo es importante para Camila y nos acerca un poquito más a la esperanzadora cirugía en Miami,  a la convicción de que aún estamos a tiempo para que los sueños de mi Cami... bailar, saltar, cantar y ser diseñadora de joyas y moda, se realicen y pueda mejorar su calidad de vida.
La meta es ambiciosa, pero confío en Dios y en la solidaridad de todo el que lee esto, nos conozca o no, y eso me da fuerzas para seguir enfrentando el reto.

Para que lleves siempre a mi Cami cerca del corazón, he diseñado como recompensa a la generosa colaboración, una polera serigrafiada con el logo de campaña, donde puedes elegir el talle, buscando en el lateral de la página, la recompensa que te hará acreedor de ella.
¡Gracias por colaborar para que Camila pueda tener una mejor calidad de vida y pueda cumplir sus sueños!







ENGLISH


Hi, I am Karen, Camila’s mom. We live in La Paz, Bolivia.
Camila is twelve years old and at the age of two, she was
diagnosed with a ‘porencephalic cyst on the left temporo parietal side’
following a stroke at birth. As a consequence Camila has epilepsy and
hemiplegia, which affected the right side of her body. She has been having
continual seizures since then. 
Yet despite the challenges she has endured, multiple tests
at hospitals, debilitating effects after each seizure and the countless
sessions of physiotherapy to gain strength and mobility in her right side,
Camila always has a smile on her face.
By the age of four, Camila was having twenty seizures a
day, which prevented her from attending a formal school. This situation prompted
me to create an educational community for her and for children like her.  

vocesvitalesbolivia.blogspot.comgoogle.com/+KarenFloresPalacios
Since her diagnosis, Camila has been on multiple medications
which unfortunately have failed to control the seizures. After having done
everything possible in Bolivia, in 2007 we decided to take her to the Miami Children's
Hospital for a comprehensive evaluation. 
The studies determined that her epilepsy was resistance to medications,
but she was candidate for a resective brain surgery. Thank God there was hope, at
least a path of light.
Epilepsy brain surgery is not offered in Bolivia.  So, during these years, we have been saving
money for the surgery and Camila has been taking three epilepsy drugs. Miraculously,
her seizures have decreased and we hoped that the surgery would not be
necessary.
In September 2014, we took her back to the Miami Children's Hospital. But our hopes were shattered when they informed us that her
condition was a little more complicated. According to the medical exams her
seizures are now affecting the right side of the brain and there is a risk that
the seizures can turn into generalized seizures and affect the whole
brain. 
The brain surgery is needed now more than
ever. Her last evaluation at Miami Children’s Hospital says that she is a
candidate for hemispherectomy surgery and disconnection of the damaged
left hemisphere. This new situation means that we need to act quickly and we
need more resources. We are aware of the risks associated with this kind of
surgery, but we know that God is on our side.
The team at Miami Children’s Hospital believe that the
surgery has a 90% chance of curing her seizures. You can imagine how magical
this would be for Camila. She is a beautiful girl and a loving daughter. She
loves dancing, jumping, singing and her dream is to become a fashion and jewellery
designer. 

Please support Camila in having this
operation in USA. The goal is
ambitious, so any donations big or small are so much appreciated. Please share
this page, far and wide, to all your friends, colleagues, and family. Updates
on our fundraising efforts will be shared on this page.
Thank you so much for
giving Camila a chance to start a new life.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>From the time I was very young, I believed in magic. A
faerie door appeared in my room one day, and I always dreamed of what lay
beyond. Fast forward to my adulthood. I still believe in magic, and my niece
does too. She came home one day crushed because her teacher told her faeries
were not real. That night, a faerie door appeared in her room. She asked me
what was beyond it. I told her that I would show her, but she would have to
come with me. And right there <i>The Door</i>
was born.</p>
<p><i>The Door</i> is a
visual story exploring the idea of what lies beyond a faerie door and how the
different inhabitants of the Magic World can all have different agendas and
intents for The Girl wandering in their midst. Through the eyes of The Girl,
the viewer confronts the mundane made mystical—a fisherman finding his catch in
a fountain, for example—and embarks on a journey of discovering the magic that
is inside all of us as well. By the time the journey ends, The Girl will
understand where those who live in the Magic World came from, and so will the
viewer.</p>
<p>A common theme through the entire series is a subtle
warning: <i>""Not all magic is good
magic.""</i> The Magic World is a place of wonder, but it is not always
safe. The Girl echoes a bit of our subconscious, of knowing what is good and
right just by the way we are made to feel by those around us.</p>
<p>The characters you meet in <i>The Door</i> are seen through the eyes of a child. Take yourself back
to the time when you believed in magic, and soon you will understand the lure
of <i>The Door</i>.</p>

<p></p></div>","Not at this moment, of course, but in the grand scheme of things we are all mortal and our time is fleeting. Death is the ultimate price of life and that is why we feel the urge to make every moment count.
But, some individuals have actually accomplished their greatest deeds and participated in their most epic adventures long after their demise.
After Life: True Tales of the Wandering Dead is a thoughtful and well-researched compilation of these very real post -mortem adventures.



WHAT IS THE BOOK ABOUT?Learn the complete history of mummy commerce - the trade of human remains for the production of medicine, pigments and more! Unearth the very real role Body Snatchers and ‘Resurrectionists’ performed in the name of science. Read about the Portuguese concubine who was exhumed and made Queen and about the deceased Wild West outlaw who traveled America as a fun-house prop.These are just a small sampling of the very true tales of the wandering dead that can be found in the pages of After Life.Other post-mortem exploits chronicled include:
the deceased sideshow freak who continued her travels as a taxidermied attration
the corpse who was hung for treason

the successful mummification of Lenin and the upkeep involved

the famous dead
the immortal beloved
the bone collectors
...and more!Also included, are the bizarre-but-true tales of the various bits and pieces – severed heads, hearts and parts - that traveled light and had extraordinary adventures.CHAPTER TITLES HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED!I'm very happy to announce the chapter titles for After Life: True Tales of the Wandering Dead.1.  Our Dearly Departed2.  The Merchants of Mummy3.  The Body Snatchers4.  Dead Reckonings5.  The Mummified Monkey Girl6.  The Embalmed Outlaw7.  The Dead and Famous8.  The Incredible Incorruptibles9.  Behold, A Grave Surprise10. Bits and Pieces11. Modern MummiesBonus Chapter: Doctor DollmakerI'm looking forward to supplying more details and sharing these chapters with you.A CONDENSED EXCERPT:Did you know that Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein, kept the heart of her husband in her desk and wrapped in silk for decades? Would you believe that isn't the strangest part of the story? Neatorama has posted a condensed excerpt from my book. http://bit.ly/GzNa5S
REWARDS
Everyone at and above the $10 mark receives an exclusive postcard inscribed with a personal handwritten note of thanks. I will personally put pen to paper and thank your for your support. BOOKS:The are several options for backers who desire a copy of the book. The finished book will be available as a digital download and in both softcover and limited edition hardcover! It's really up to you and your level of support.APPAREL:For just $35 you will receive a digital copy of the book as well as an exclusive After Life t-shirt.Mary Shelley, the author of Frankenstein, kept the heart of her deceased husband stored in her desk for decades. This exclusive shirt design commemorates that true tale and features a passage from Shelley's Frankenstein. Initially, I thought artwork and illustrations would be a challenge. Acquiring printing and reproduction rights is expensive and prohibitive. To counter this I have commissioned my dear friend Rob Sacchetto to create all original artwork to accompany each chapter of After Life: True Tales of the Wandering Dead.image set to accompany the 'mummy commerce' chapter
image set to accompany the bonus chapter

image set to accompany the 'grave robbing' chapter 
Rob Sacchetto is perhaps the most prolific artist on the planet. Best known for his zombie-themed artwork Rob’s work has appeared in Stuff Magazine, Rue Morgue, Fangoria, Maxim, HorrorHound, National Geographic and on G4 TV, Discovery Channel, Space, IFC, Starz, and Reviews on the Run and numerous other video media outlets. Rob’s the real deal and I’m absolutely thrilled to have him onboard.Chapter images will be posted in updates as they are received.The vast majority of self published or vanity press books are of poor quality and are not commercially available at reasonable prices. I am intent on putting out a quality product that will be available in brick and mortar bookstores. To accomplish this, I must incur the costs usually absorbed by commercial publishers. Editing, proofreading, design, layout, marketing, distribution and registration - these are all costly. The funds raised here will not cover the total costs involved. I am kicking in a personal amount as well. This book will not be built completely on your contributions. We are in this together.100% of the funds raised via this campaign will be used to create, edit and print a legitimate commercial product available in brick and mortar stores. ISBN numbers will be obtained as a Library of Congress Control Number and proper Copyright Registration.I’ve written a great deal of material over the years but it has always been in short article form. I am aware that my grammar is far from flawless and my thorough research methods are somewhat chaotic in nature.The main challenge of this project is in turning my mad ramblings into a legible and coherent full-length piece of non-fiction. For that, I will be relying on the talents of an excellent editor as well as a professional proofreader. Their diligent contributions will likely result in rewrites as well as prolong the overall process.This will, however, ensure a very well polished final product.I am a graduate of Laurentian University, where I majored in classical studies and theology. I have worked as a funeral director, sideshow performer and voice actor.Since March of 2006, I have been the sole author of TheHumanMarvels.com; a site dedicated to highlighting the remarkable lives of those born exceedingly different.My work has been featured in various media outlets including CBC Radio, Rue Morgue Magazine, Bizarre Magazine, Oxford Press, G4TV, TLC and more.I also occasionally consults on projects, lecture on human genetic variety and monstrous origins and continue to perform sideshow stunts as the co-founder of the Something Strange showcase.WE MADE IT!  We’ve managed to reach our base goal in a very short amount of time! This book is now a sure thing - if you have been hesitating, hesitate no more!To everyone who has supported the project thus far, thank you!ONWARD! TO THE STRETCH GOALS!

At $3500, the book will feature a special bonus chapter. A tale so strange and unsettling that its inclusion will leave your spine tingling for days! REACHED!


At $4500 every supporter who purchased a softcover or hardcover edition will also receive a limited edition art print featuring the custom chapter break illustrations created by world-renowned illustrator Rob Sacchetto! REACHED!

At $5500 every supporter who purchased a softcover or hardcover edition will also receive a super secret gift. This gift is very strange indeed and will only be revealed once the $5000 milestone is reached.

Les résultats seront ensuite rendus pubblic à l'occasion d'une exposition intitulée Future Landscape, en juin 2014. Par l'intermédiaire de l'exposition, j'espère que je vous permettrai de toucher de près le problème et que nous comprendrons ensemble les divers aspects de ce conflit qui va bien au-delà de la consctruction d'une nouvelle ligne de chemin de fer. Le parcours à pied sera décrit en temps réel sur la page facebook.L'aideAvec une contribution, même petite, vous financez le voyage et la réalisation de l'exposition. Chaque donation aidera à développer un modèle d'investigation qui part de la base. Modèle où personellement, comme auteur du projet, je rendrai compte de mon travail à vous qui financerez l'opération. Future Landscape est un processus en cours, auquel vous pouvez participer, par exemple à travers la page facebook: vous avez la possibilité d'influencer le déroulement du travail, à travers des propositions ou des critiques, dans l'esprit d'une recherche collective et de participation. Le financementAvec une donation vous financerez les instruments de documentation du voyage: audio recoder, cartes de mémoire SD, localizzateur GPS, impression et tirage pour la production du matériel de l'exposition (photographies, infographique, modèles réduits). Si vous ne pouvez pas donner, aidez-moi en partageant ce video sur les sociaux network, en envoyant une mail avec des suggestions et des critiques, ou en me prétant un localisateur GPS. MERCI!Risques du projetLe projet est compliqué et ambitieux, il pourrait ne pas atteindre les résultats espérés. En particulier: 1. reccueillir du matériel Pro et No TAV en quantité équivalente. 2. les parts qui composent l'exposition ne sont pas encore bien définies (photographies, videos, modèles réduits, infographique). Le caractère des l'informations que je trouverai le long de mon exploration déterminera quel est le meilleur médium pour les comuniquer.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

In other words, we take the piss! We've been doing it since we were born, but they finally let us do it on the internet on April 30th of 2013, and we've been doing it daily ever since.</p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Why We Do It</span></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The whole Wunderground project stems from our love of music (and our love of electronic music in particular) as well as our love of having a laugh and poking fun at… well, everything really. We poke fun at the things we love, we poke fun at the things we hate, and most importantly, we poke fun at ourselves... which comes surprisingly easy. When we started Wunderground, the aim was to create a website that mirrored the atmosphere you would find at a really good house party. Great music and lots of surreal messing!</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Dance music today has so many facets, so many different scenes within a scene. Some are humble, some are outrageous. Some are credible, loads are ridiculous. It's these subtle and not so subtle differences that give us our daily ammunition for stories. In the end, as much as we love the music and the characters involved in making it and appreciating it, Wunderground was created as something that was meant to be enjoyed, meant to be fun, something not to be taken too seriously. We try daily to make the scene as a whole laugh at itself, at each other, and at us.</span></p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Journey So Far</span></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In just seven short months online we have grown from a small Irish website getting a tiny 6 visitors a day into a worldwide entity sharing its stories with 1.5 million visitors a month as well as being talked about and shared by some of the biggest names in the business. Everybody from Frankie Knuckles to Nile Rodgers, from David Guetta to Disclosure. We've done some great things already, but we have so many more ideas we want to share. The first of these is our new bimonthly digital magazine, packed with new stories and features and sent directly to our readers who know us and love what we do.</span></p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Help Us Make It Happen</span></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">By investing in this project you can help us make Wunderground Magazine a reality. You can help bring it into existence and forever be a part of its history, either by simply buying a copy, or by starring in the actual issue as a cameo role character, or by bagging yourself some of the limited edition goodies we are releasing just for this inaugural issue and never to be released again.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In order to create the issue and distribute it across the various platforms we estimate that we need to hit a minimum of €5000. That figure is taking into account the cost of the rewards goodies that we need to manufacture to make the project happen (Limited edition T-Shirts, Sweatshirts, Postcards, Mugs, Posters etc) and it also takes into account all of the associated shipping costs needed to get those out, so we aren't charging any extra shipping on the projects. Shipping is free to anywhere in the world!</span></p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Cameos </span></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In order to make the project happen, we wanted to do something really special! We wanted to offer rewards that you, our readers, would really enjoy and would never forget. And what could be more special that giving you the opportunity to actually star in Wunderground as a character? Or a recurring character? You simply need to provide us with a name and a location and we'll do the rest! We made this the main focus of our rewards system, as we simply love the idea of having our readers appear as cameos in our stories!</span></p><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Goodies</span></h4><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are also offering goodies! But rather than offer bog standard plain t-shirts or run-of-the-mill stuff, we are having everything handmade in limited edition quantities to mark the occasion. These limited edition items available here to mark the first issue of our magazine will NEVER be released again. It's fair to say, if anything doesn't sell, there will be fights in our office over who gets them!</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If we don't reach our full goal, the funds we receive will still go towards issue one.

For two years in Tallahassee I worked alongside numerous successful writers, gained exposure to the field, and further developed my own craft and voice.

<h3>Hey! Thanks for stopping by. If you want to know the who, what, when, where, and why about Unconventional Methods of Book Promotion and Networking and the campaign, the details are both in the video and in the explanation below. The video is a simplified version of the explanation.</h3>
<h3>Who are you?</h3>
<p>I'm Tiffany Cole. Hi! Professionally, I'm an editor, coach, reviewer, and author. I used to own Honest Crits, an online sole proprietorship dedicated to editing and coaching. Now I offer my services sporadically at my author website (<a href=""http://www.tiffanytcole.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tiffanytcole.com</a>). I'm also the founder and editor-in-chief of Reader's Den, a book blog dedicated to book reviews.</p>
<p>When I'm not working, I'm just a 19-year-old college student with cloudcuckoolander tendencies and a lot to learn about this whole becoming an adult thing.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's the purpose of this campaign? What's the money going to be used for?</h3>
<p>Before the first semester of college is over - preferably by September or October - I want to publish a guide called 'Unconventional Methods of Book Promotion and Networking.' It's basically a combination of everything I've learned about promotion and networking before I knew conventional methods existed and the overlooked methods I learned to utilize after trying conventional methods.</p>
<p>The money I make from book sales will help me pay for college. That, and the fact that I love helping authors, is a big reason why I decided to start this campaign.</p>
<p>I finished the first draft, but there is so much more to self-publishing a book than writing it. I need $1000 for production and development costs and $1000 for marketing. Here's how the money will be used:</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Production and Development </span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cover Design</li>
<li>Formatting</li>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>ISBN</li>
<li>Distribution</li>
<li>Paperback Copies</li>
<li>Proofreading</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Marketing</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Giveaways</li>
<li>Shelf Displays</li>
<li>Tours</li>
<li>Transportation Costs</li>
<li>Experimental Promotion</li>
</ul>
<p>$2000 is actually not a whole lot to work with, but I'm very meticulous when it comes to money - meticulous enough to make reasonable budgets work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Will I benefit from helping you out?</h3>
<p>Of course! I would never ask for this much help without carefully thinking about ways this could benefit you as well. That's why I've created a variety of perks, and why I plan on making sure you know exactly what's happening every step of the way. For instance, the $25 pledge is loaded. You get a signed print copy, a digital copy, a signed tl;dr card (a simplified version of the book that you can take with you or put on your desk), and your name will be listed on my website. Any pledge above $25 includes coaching, and you can donate as low as $1 and $5 and still get something.</p>
<p>However, my perks are meant to benefit writers or people who know writers, though you'll be featured as a supporter/backer on either my website or in my book with a link to a site of your choosing. Name dropping never hurts, right?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How can I help, even if I don't have much money?</h3>
I love donating to campaigns. However, I have little to no money to spare. That's why campaigns with perks for as little as $1-15 make me so happy. That's often all I can give. I created perk rewards for donations as low as $1, $5, and $10 to let people know that any amount counts, no matter how small, and I appreciate your support. Plus, you can always share the campaign via Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Google Plus, Youtube, etc.</div>
<h3>What if you raise less than your $2000 goal?</h3>
<p>I'll make it work. If anything, I'm a trooper. Like I said above, I'm very meticulous when it comes to money. Your money won't go to waste no matter how much I make. I'll find a way.</p>
<h3>What if you raise more than your $2000 goal?</h3>
<p>The more money, the more I can do to improve production, development, and marketing. If I make more than $5000 (which would rock my world because I'm not expecting that at all), the money will go to the next two nonfiction books I'm working on - The DIY Guide to Book Promotion and Networking: Before Publication and After Publication.</p>
<h3>When will the books be available and when will I get my perks?</h3>
<p>Depending on how timely the production and development process is, the book should be available by mid-October, if not earlier. I'll start giving out perks a week after the release. For all of you who purchased the $50 plan and up, I'll specifically talk to you about what week is best for coaching/consultation/editing.</p>

In order to collect the necessary research for completion, <b>we need to return to Iceland for two weeks in June 2014. </b>June is an essential month as a wider range of public services are available, more museums are open, and roads to isolated areas such as the West Fjords are easily accessible.  <br/></p><p></p><p>All content for this book has either been collected or is in the process of collection. During our 2013 trip, we collected material at Jökulsárlón, Þingvellir, and Reynisfjara, and this year we intend to expand our research to Western and Northwestern Iceland.

Hello! We are Wailana and Anna, a writer from Portland and photographer from Boise. In October 2013, we traveled to Iceland for ten days. The trip inspired us to collaborate on a book that combines our respective passions for photography and personal essay. These essays will be short, artistic and intimate works of creative nonfiction with a personal narrative, focusing on the relationship between landscape and mythology. Each essay will focus on a different geographical feature, for example ice, and will be accompanied by corresponding photographs of the striking Icelandic landscape.But we need your help! Your support will help us to research the final section of our project and to self-publish the book. In order to collect the necessary research for completion, we need to return to Iceland for two weeks in June 2014. June is an essential month as a wider range of public services are available, more museums are open, and roads to isolated areas such as the West Fjords are easily accessible.  All content for this book has either been collected or is in the process of collection. During our 2013 trip, we collected material at Jökulsárlón, Þingvellir, and Reynisfjara, and this year we intend to expand our research to Western and Northwestern Iceland. We are in contact with experts, writers and guides within Iceland, who will be contributing their insights and local wisdom. Our aim is to publish and distribute the book to our Indiegogo contributors in mid-2015.
We imagine the book to be about 70 pages, 10x8"" in dimension, with 40 color photographs (though this number may evolve as we collect material). We envision full-page text on one page and a full-page photo(s) on the other. The final publication could differ in format, length and title from our present layout. The book may also include behind-the-scenes photos, anecdotal snapshots of exploration, and interviews, interspersed throughout. Reimagining Myth in Landscape: Photo Essays on Iceland explores the link between mythology and landscape. As a nation with a deep connection to its legends and geography, Iceland is the ideal setting in which to examine this relationship. Old tales tell of gods born of fire and ice, and humans shaped from driftwood. Heroes have given their lives and names to locations throughout the country. Stories of trolls, elves, and hidden folk still persists as part of the cultural identity of Icelanders. Mythology is a medium through
which we explore human nature; myths perpetuate custom, explain the
inexplicable, justify our values and decisions, and provide role models. We create
our myths, yet they are informed by the natural world around us. How
deep is the connection between ourselves, our myths and the landscape? As landscape evolves, these changes affect
our values and our identity. How does Iceland serve as a model of the benefits of preserving wilderness as a source of identity, of wonder, awe, and inspiration?  Our project endeavors to address these questions and to explore the
interdependent relationship of myth, landscape and identity through personal essay
and photography. 1. Conducting interviews and fieldwork as part of the research.

atheists, who have been shedding religion and no longer support the view of
Jesus promoted by the institutional church - one that leads to condemning people
of other faiths, forces Christians to adopt beliefs and practices they often cannot
live up to or support in good conscience, and requires people to promote a
message that divides human beings in the name of Jesus, in the name of God.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We believe that Jesus stood for the inherent, equal, and divine
worth of every human being, including standing for your own greatness no matter
what. It involves courageously working towards a world that works for each and every
divine nobody on the planet. Like these two ordinary folks:</p>

message by self-publishing this book. Kind of scary; never done this before!
THE DIVINE NOBODIES TRIBE
My loyal tribe has shared this journey with me the last
several years. They are ordinary people, mostly from a Christian background, including
atheists, who have been shedding religion and no longer support the view of
Jesus promoted by the institutional church - one that leads to condemning people
of other faiths, forces Christians to adopt beliefs and practices they often cannot
live up to or support in good conscience, and requires people to promote a
message that divides human beings in the name of Jesus, in the name of God.
We believe that Jesus stood for the inherent, equal, and divine
worth of every human being, including standing for your own greatness no matter
what. It involves courageously working towards a world that works for each and every
divine nobody on the planet. Like these two ordinary folks:
Joe, a fireman who survived 9/11, remembers
Catholic school, namely Sister Agnistine's class, involved getting the crap
kicked out of him leaving him with a distorted view of God as harsh and angry
instead of loving and kind. ""My journey has taken me to the place where I
want to know God more intimately and I believe the way to do so is to remove
all the 'religious stuff'.""
Lynn is a counselor whose been working at a county
correctional facility for the last 20 years. ""I read Divine Nobodies recently
after having it on my client bookshelf for the last 3 yrs. I needed the
confirmation [your book] gave. I am a lesbian who will be marrying (in NY
State) the gal I have been with for the last 15 yrs.  I am thrilled but a
couple of friends who are very religious have tried to piss on my parade
with their fears for my spiritual health. I just wanted to thank you for being
a fellow spiritual buddy and I will checkout your blog, the other book you have
written and the one that you recently have written.  Thank you, thank you,
thank you, Jim !!!!!  Hugs, Lynn""
THE CHALLENGE
My mission to empower the oneness of all humanity is to
self-publish and freely market Being
Jesus in Nashville to news outlets, social media and more. My first two books, Divine Nobodies and Wide Open Spaces, published through Thomas Nelson Publishers, reached over 40,000 readers. But now I don't have the machinery or the usual teamwork of a
publishing house to market and promote this book. That's why I'm asking you to
pledge your support and the simple power of sharing my story with your network.


If Divine Nobodies
or Wide Open Spaces were meaningful
to you and your journey, if my presence online through my blog, Facebook and
Twitter has added something to your life, if you believe in what this book and
campaign is about, I want to personally ask that you contribute to the cause.The monies contributed to the campaign will be used for: a) the administrative cost of self-publishing the book, b) marketing and promotion efforts, and c) a Being Jesus Book Tour. PICK A PERK!!
I've provided several perks for your pledges. Every amount
matters no matter how small!! But we suggest a donation of at least
$25-50.  PICK ONE NOW!
Three Huge & Simple Ways You Can Promote the Cause
1)     
Buy 10 copies of the book to share with friends
and family on the release date (soon to be announced). Thanks Andrea C. for suggesting this idea!!
2)

<p>Ossington is a charming, walkable, character-rich destination that draws visitors locally and from around the GTA, and has been written up in the Guardian and the New York Times.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the condo industry will put their oversized, dominating, boring buildings and chain stores wherever they can make the most money. </p>
<p>We care about preserving the cool unique places in Toronto that make it a fun and interesting city. We think it would be too bad if it all became homogenized. We think Ossington in particular is worth saving.</p>
<p>That's what we're fundraising for.</p>
<h3>Where we are and where we're going</h3>
<p>The Ossington Community Association has been busting our butts for the last year trying to roll back a really out-of-character condo. We've done a lot: City Hall, the condo industry, and the powers that be in the media have really noticed. In particular, the Planning Department has been doing an ""Area Study"" (in the scheme of things, that's a big deal).</p>
<p>But now we have to go the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) -- that provincial judiciary that developers go running to whenever they think City Hall might say no.</p>
<p>The OMB is super-expensive: you pay a lawyer and a planner for a *week*. That makes it the developer's trump card. So now we need to complement our ""sweat equity"" with cold hard cash.</p>
<h3>Why we are fundraising</h3>
<p>We have a great lawyer and planner. We think we can win. But costs could go as high as $45,000 in the worst case.</p>
<p>We aren't a community of doctors, lawyers, and business people. We are ""creatives"". That means we have to get ""creative"" in fundraising.</p>
<p>That is why we are reaching out to you. If you love Ossington -- if you want Toronto to keep its character -- if you don't think the money power should get its way all the time -- consider kicking in.</p>
<h3>10% of your bar tab?</h3>
<p>How much have you used Ossington in the last six months? How much do you anticipate using Ossington in the next six months? </p>
<p>Think about how much you spend each time you go out. Over the course of a year, for a lot of people, the sum will add up to thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>That's a lot of value, right?</p>
<p>Now think about how much it's worth to you to keep the Ossington vibe intact. Now consider the prospect of kicking in 10% of your annual Ossington bar/restaurant tab. </p>
<p>We like to think of what we're doing as ""crowd-sourced urban planning"": City Hall, for whatever reason, isn't up to the task by itself, so it's up to the people to do right by the city. If so, you could look at our ask as ""crowd-sourced entertainment taxation"".</p>

<p>Back in 1999 I wrote a comedic horror entitled <i>1-800-VAMPIRE</i>. As the urban fantasy
genre didn’t yet exist literary agents and boutique publishers scratched their
heads and said “What the hell is this?” The most helpful replies explained that since the 1993 Safeway publishing re-shuffle, genre mattered
and mine didn’t fit into any. One later-revealed practical joker said “Women should try to
get published in romance first.”</p>
<p>So in 2000 I wrote a romance novel and sent it to the world’s
largest boutique publisher, famous for low standards and lower royalties.
I signed a contract, but they broke it when they kept asking me to make my
heroine dumber. I tried to explain that you can’t be a top level government
counter-terrorism expert and a brainless bimbo at the same time. We parted ways and settled out of court.</p>
<p>I proceeded to get my degrees and went into the soulless world of
corporate finance. I wrote short stories at my desk and reformatted <i>1-800-VAMPIRE</i> into a new style I’d
discovered at Powell’s in Portland when a clerk recommended Kim Harrison to me: urban fantasy. This time the rejection letters basically said “Get published
elsewhere first, kid. Also… why is there humor?”</p>
<p>So I kept the rejection letters in a box, joined
Literotica.com as <a href=""http://www.literotica.com/stories/memberpage.php?uid=879271&amp;page=bio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">madam_noe</a> and started getting good, honest feedback on my
writing. Time went on. I won some awards, the financial crash of 2008 kicked me
out finance for seemingly good, and then the self-publishing revolution came.</p>
<p>I published <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Nora-Quick/e/B005LTAFW8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two books </a>myself which sell as slowly as most
new authors can expect. Then I submitted an erotic fantasy
sword-and-sorcery novel, <i><a href=""http://www.eredsage.com/store/HiddenMagic.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hidden Magic</a></i>,
to Red Sage.</p>
<p>They’re great, but do not give out advances. At this point I
know to get to where I want to go: I need an agent who can sell my work to a
large legacy publisher. And so I’ve turned back to the project, renaming it <i>The Longest Midnight</i>.</p>
<p>I have it plotted out, character bios done. And I have ideas
jotted down for eleven sequels. But this one I want to do the right way, the
traditional way, but not with a traditional product.</p>
<p>With your help I can get a printer and cover the expenses I
need to finish writing <i>TLM</i> and send
it out January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2015. This will happen, but only with your help.
I am between jobs and rather than pound the pavement forty to eighty hours a
week I want to buckle down and finish <i>TLM</i>.</p>
<p>Your donations will keep me free to write an urban fantasy
novel with heroic arcs, supernatural creatures, steamy sex, compelling
characters, and dark comedy. And fear not! If this project does not appeal to publishers just yet  will self-publish and use Create Space for paperback copies. Your perks and return on investment are 100% guaranteed.</p>
<p>You can meet the main characters in some old short stories
on Literotica where they appear in the stories <i></i><a href=""http://www.literotica.com/s/the-forever-ghosts-ch-01"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Forever Ghosts,</a> <i></i><a href=""http://www.literotica.com/s/swimming-the-dusty-river-ch-01"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Swimming the Dusty River</a><i></i>, and <i></i><a href=""http://www.literotica.com/s/durands-story-pt-01"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Durand’s Story.</a> Those are absent humor as
they are a dark re-imagining of <i>1-800-VAMPIRE.</i> However, these are the men and women to expect in <i>TLM</i>.</p>
<p>They are: Alex, a private eye who can control souls, the only living Binder. Donna, her half psychotic best friend and roommate. Mark, Donna' survivalist nut boyfriend, another roommate. Irene, Alex's dead great-aunt who haunts their home, yet another roommate. There's also Santiago, a four hundred year old vampire addicted to video games renting the apartment above their garage, and their newest couch surfer, Donna's crazy ambulance chaser father. Rounding out the motley crew is Durand, the oldest vampire alive, king of the outcasts by night pretending to be a human cop on the graveyard list. As Something Wicked they are paranormal investigators to humans, and P.I.s to the supernatural world.</p>
<p>You can follow my progress on <a href=""http://noraquick.yolasite.com/the-quick-blog.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my website’s blog</a>, and please,
friends, help if you can. You don’t need to donate money if you can’t, you can
spread the news on social networking sites. Every little bit counts and is
deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>I am sick of immature characters who lament their gifts, bad sex that reads like the worst porno ever made, and forced
romance plots that get in the way of grand arcs. It’s time to create a new subgenre of urban fantasy where
characters enjoy being what they are, sex is natural, and even dark lives are
touched by humor.</p>
<p>Help me change urban fantasy and bring it up to a fully
respected genre with more to it than just the Jim Butchers, Mary Janice Davidsons, or Charlaine Harrises of the world. And
when this works, perhaps you can help me name this new subgenre. Comedy with bite? Bloody funny? Urban Tragi-comedy?</p>
<p>Whatever we decide together, let’s take the emo out of urban fantasy!</p>

<p><i>                          <b>&lt;For excerpts from The Unbound Soul scroll down&gt;</b><br/></i></p>
<br/>
<p>My name is Richard Haight and I teach spiritual unfoldment, meditation, energetic
healing, and martial arts. After spending 15 years living and
training these ancient arts in Japan, I was awarded masters licenses
and encouraged to open my own school. I now live in the
countryside of southern Oregon, where I've founded the art of
Shinkaido, a practical path to spiritual unfoldment.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been guided throughout my life by a series of profound 
visions. As a result of following these visions, I have found what I 
believe every person, deep down, is really looking for: a profound 
oneness and connectedness with all that is. I have written a book, The 
Unbound Soul, that will help the reader unveil that same oneness within.
 Reading The Unbound Soul sparks profound insights into its readers' own
 minds and their sense of self - those things that are blocking us from 
our deepest being within.</li>
<li>The manuscript is written and the material has been tested on 
my students, and they have made incredibly quick progress with regard to
 spiritual unfoldment. Now we need to make this work accessible to the 
world so as to assist in humanity's shift to higher consciousness. The 
writing was the easy part; now it's time to publish. Publishing is an 
expensive endeavor. We need copy editing, proof reading, layout, 
formatting, and cover design. This is an opportunity to include your 
energy in a project that will not only help to unbind your own soul but 
the soul of humanity. Truly, we are in the right place at the right 
time.</li>
</ul>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What we need and what you get</h3>
<br/><ul>
<li>We need a minimum of $8,000 from this campaign in order to publish a fully professional book. When I calculate the expenses of printing, packaging, and sending books out, as well as the expenses of the Indiegogo campaign, we'll end up with roughly $4500. First and foremost we need to pay for professional cover editing, which amounts to roughly $2,000 for this manuscript, Then we will need formatting and layout work done, which will be another $1,500. Then we'll need to have a proofreader go over the manuscript, which will be another $600. Of course, we need to purchase ISBN's, copyrights and other such misc, which will put us up another several hundred. If we get more than we need then the remaining funds will go to cover design, which typically is the most expensive part ($2,000). <br/>
</li>
<li>For every donation, we have something to give in thanks for your support. I have produced several instructional videos (one details a powerful meditation method, and the other is about communication with nature) which you will have access to. I'll be sending out ebooks as well as a limited contributor's edition of the printed and signed books. I will also be offering private Skype mentoring, private in-person, and couples mentoring. We'll have contributor seminars as well. And finally, I will also travel to offer seminars to contributors.<br/>
</li> <li>If I don't reach the entire goal, the funds will be prioritized to copy editing and proofreading first so that the content of the book is at the highest level possible. Next in priority, I will hire formating and layout professionals. I'm working hard to figure out that stuff myself, so if need be I will do it. A professional would be able to do a better job in all likelihood, though. Finally, if we bring in more than our goal, I can hire a book cover designer. Covers still sell books, but I feel the cover I have come up with  myself would work if need be. I would love your thoughts on the cover if you care to comment.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Most of us who have already begun to spiritually awaken are well aware of the shift in consciousness that is rapidly coming through humanity. Such a shift carries with it the potential for resistance from the mind. The Unbound Soul is written to focus the reader's attention upon the resistive nature of the mind and, through this awareness, those resistances begin to resolve. The Unbound Soul is a unique and completely fresh perspective on spiritual unfoldment meant to help lift humanity out of the disharmony of the egoic self and into the harmony of being.</li>
<li>Below, I have a link to an excerpt from The Unbound Soul, which gives a good feel for the nature of the book:<br/>

</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <br/> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><br/></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>I am one of a small handful of foreigners to ever be awarded master level certifications in authentic samurai arts in Japan. The level of dedication, persistence, and inspiration that it takes to achieve that level of training is also the same level of dedication, persistence, and inspiration needed to accomplish any challenge.<br/>
</li> <li>The manuscript is already finished. With your help it will be published in both softback and eBook editions!<br/>
</li>
<br/> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<br/><ul>
<li>I would encourage anyone who feels pulled to be a part of this project to help in any way that they can. If you don't have funds to contribute, then perhaps you could help to spread the word about this campaign through email, Facebook, or Twitter, for example. Also, remember that Indiegogo has share tools, so you might check them out if that feels right to you. You could also send the link to my website and the book excerpt via email, Facebook, and/or Twitter or even add it to your links on your own website in order to get out the word. <br/>

                          <For excerpts from The Unbound Soul scroll down>

My name is Richard Haight and I teach spiritual unfoldment, meditation, energetic
healing, and martial arts. After spending 15 years living and
training these ancient arts in Japan, I was awarded masters licenses
and encouraged to open my own school. I now live in the
countryside of southern Oregon, where I've founded the art of
Shinkaido, a practical path to spiritual unfoldment.

I have been guided throughout my life by a series of profound 
visions. As a result of following these visions, I have found what I 
believe every person, deep down, is really looking for: a profound 
oneness and connectedness with all that is. I have written a book, The 
Unbound Soul, that will help the reader unveil that same oneness within.
 Reading The Unbound Soul sparks profound insights into its readers' own
 minds and their sense of self - those things that are blocking us from 
our deepest being within.
The manuscript is written and the material has been tested on 
my students, and they have made incredibly quick progress with regard to
 spiritual unfoldment. Now we need to make this work accessible to the 
world so as to assist in humanity's shift to higher consciousness. The 
writing was the easy part; now it's time to publish. Publishing is an 
expensive endeavor. We need copy editing, proof reading, layout, 
formatting, and cover design. This is an opportunity to include your 
energy in a project that will not only help to unbind your own soul but 
the soul of humanity. Truly, we are in the right place at the right 
time.


What we need and what you get

We need a minimum of $8,000 from this campaign in order to publish a fully professional book. When I calculate the expenses of printing, packaging, and sending books out, as well as the expenses of the Indiegogo campaign, we'll end up with roughly $4500. First and foremost we need to pay for professional cover editing, which amounts to roughly $2,000 for this manuscript, Then we will need formatting and layout work done, which will be another $1,500. Then we'll need to have a proofreader go over the manuscript, which will be another $600. Of course, we need to purchase ISBN's, copyrights and other such misc, which will put us up another several hundred. If we get more than we need then the remaining funds will go to cover design, which typically is the most expensive part ($2,000). 

For every donation, we have something to give in thanks for your support. I have produced several instructional videos (one details a powerful meditation method, and the other is about communication with nature) which you will have access to. I'll be sending out ebooks as well as a limited contributor's edition of the printed and signed books. I will also be offering private Skype mentoring, private in-person, and couples mentoring. We'll have contributor seminars as well. And finally, I will also travel to offer seminars to contributors.
 If I don't reach the entire goal, the funds will be prioritized to copy editing and proofreading first so that the content of the book is at the highest level possible. Next in priority, I will hire formating and layout professionals. I'm working hard to figure out that stuff myself, so if need be I will do it. A professional would be able to do a better job in all likelihood, though. Finally, if we bring in more than our goal, I can hire a book cover designer. Covers still sell books, but I feel the cover I have come up with  myself would work if need be. I would love your thoughts on the cover if you care to comment.




The Impact


Most of us who have already begun to spiritually awaken are well aware of the shift in consciousness that is rapidly coming through humanity. Such a shift carries with it the potential for resistance from the mind. The Unbound Soul is written to focus the reader's attention upon the resistive nature of the mind and, through this awareness, those resistances begin to resolve. The Unbound Soul is a unique and completely fresh perspective on spiritual unfoldment meant to help lift humanity out of the disharmony of the egoic self and into the harmony of being.
Below, I have a link to an excerpt from The Unbound Soul, which gives a good feel for the nature of the book:

     Risks & Challenges
    I am one of a small handful of foreigners to ever be awarded master level certifications in authentic samurai arts in Japan. The level of dedication, persistence, and inspiration that it takes to achieve that level of training is also the same level of dedication, persistence, and inspiration needed to accomplish any challenge.
 The manuscript is already finished. With your help it will be published in both softback and eBook editions!

    Other Ways You Can Help

I would encourage anyone who feels pulled to be a part of this project to help in any way that they can. If you don't have funds to contribute, then perhaps you could help to spread the word about this campaign through email, Facebook, or Twitter, for example. Also, remember that Indiegogo has share tools, so you might check them out if that feels right to you. You could also send the link to my website and the book excerpt via email, Facebook, and/or Twitter or even add it to your links on your own website in order to get out the word.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Welcome Back to Abuja Once Again: How I Became a Citizen of the World </i>is about my experiences traveling and helping novice and experienced travelers alike become more comfortable exploring our world. Expanding our outlook to include others different from us not only enhances our ability to deal with global crises, but also reveals our common humanity.<br/><br/>My name is Carol Yee and I am the author of <i>Welcome Back to Abuja Once Again: How I Became a Citizen of the World</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to share many of the global experiences I have had since my first plane ride to Disneyland when I was six, where I was fascinated by the ride, “It’s a Small World”. I have now traveled to over 60 countries, including such places as China, Afghanistan, and Mozambique. Through my travels, I have realized how critical it is to respect and engage people from around the world. It’s through people-to-people encounters that we learn. This leads us to expand our outlook to include others different from us, which not only enhances our ability to solve problems and deal with global crises, but also reveals our common humanity.<br/><br/>I hope that, in reading this book, you will enjoy the adventures my fellow travelers and I have experienced and get the itch to start exploring, whether from your own living room or to fly off to France or Borneo. You will also discover that people around the world seek the same things we do…to provide for their families so they are safe, healthy, and have opportunities to learn and earn a living. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to fulfill a dream you may have to explore the world. I also hope that you will see that cultures, people, and foods that may differ from ours are actually not so different and are not scary; rather, we all have more in common with each other.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of traveling overseas, including how you can impact people you meet, and how to overcome fears you may have about traveling through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How I overcame my fears of traveling and now look forward to traveling to anywhere in the world. I find that the opportunity to visit a new place, learn about its history, meet its people, and try its cuisine far outweighs any concerns I may have. I always prepare before I depart so I can understand challenges the country is facing and be mindful of any particular situation so as not to offend. Travel allows me to have a better understanding of people who are different from me so that I can focus on our similarities.</li>
<li>What motivated Susan Puska, U.S. Army Colonel (retired), to leave her small northern Michigan town to travel the world and end up as the U.S. Army Attache to China. Her family’s military service and overseas tours sparked her interest, but it was her desire to see the world and continue learning that led her to remain in the military for 29 years.</li>
<li>How I helped to provide opportunities for two young Afghan women to join a project I managed in southern Afghanistan. They went from being very shy and unsure of themselves to learning how to work in an office setting to winning over the respect of the Afghan men they were working with - no easy feat. When one woman left to fulfill her dream of going to medical school, the entire staff came to send her off, some men had tears in their eyes to see her leave.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">You will love this book if you want to read about stories of the fun of traveling overseas and meeting different people, places, and foods. If you are new to traveling, you will gain tips to make you more comfortable traveling overseas.</span></p>
<p><i>Welcome Back to Abuja Once Again</i> speaks to world travelers who want to read about someone else’s adventures and those hesitant to travel overseas who want to become comfortable about planning a trip and traveling overseas.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Welcome Back to Abuja Once Again</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you view people who are different than we are after you realize they actually face the same challenges as we do of earning a living and providing for their families?</li>
<li>How do you interact with people from other cultures in your own backyard or when you travel overseas?</li>
<li>How do you deal with global issues that actually impact us in our own communities?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing how traveling overseas and interacting with different people will change us all for the better.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Las mensajeras</strong> propone una historia en la que la reina Parsíane pretenderá evitar el despertar de los Brehom, y con él el final de su era. Para ello, se servirá de su magia y del egoísmo de su hijo Gozén, sin importar quién o quienes deban sufrir por ello.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A lo largo del relato, los diversos lugares fantásticos irán creando situaciones a las que las criaturas de Ciléo se irán viendo abocadas. Desde las insondables grutas y pantanos, hasta los temibles desiertos o el inabarcable mar de Ram. No obstante, sobre todo ello acabará resurgiendo la determinación de unos seres en absoluto dotados para la magia, pero con la mayor fuerza de voluntad posible, tanto para los fines más nobles como para los más mundanos; los Brehom. Ellos son los dueños reales del amor y del odio, del rencor y la amistad, del perdón y la condena, y por lo tanto dueños también de su destino y del mundo.

</div></div>","¿Qué?
Las mensajeras propone una historia en la que la reina Parsíane pretenderá evitar el despertar de los Brehom, y con él el final de su era. Para ello, se servirá de su magia y del egoísmo de su hijo Gozén, sin importar quién o quienes deban sufrir por ello.
A lo largo del relato, los diversos lugares fantásticos irán creando situaciones a las que las criaturas de Ciléo se irán viendo abocadas. Desde las insondables grutas y pantanos, hasta los temibles desiertos o el inabarcable mar de Ram. No obstante, sobre todo ello acabará resurgiendo la determinación de unos seres en absoluto dotados para la magia, pero con la mayor fuerza de voluntad posible, tanto para los fines más nobles como para los más mundanos; los Brehom. Ellos son los dueños reales del amor y del odio, del rencor y la amistad, del perdón y la condena, y por lo tanto dueños también de su destino y del mundo. Y sin embargo, entre misterios y conjuros, los Brehom deberán abrirse paso confiando entre ellos y confiándose a otras criaturas. Deberán confiar en Nodrag, «el más viejo de los Nádregos», y deberán aprender que no todos los enemigos lo son realmente. Todo ello para aflorar por fin el nuevo día, y con él su propia era.
La amistad entre Ogami y Tisdeno, el amor entre este y su esposa, o la profunda justicia del capitán Tago, acabaran perfilando una historia que alterará para siempre el destino de aquella inmensa tierra, tierra en la que un día ya lejano aprendieron a usar la palabra.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been exploring Personal Productivity/ GTD (Getting Things Done) in my personal life and Usability tools for my clients since 2004. Making to-do lists that actually get done, finding the technology that can make your small company look big and begin to scale, or having dreams and desires greater than your current circumstances and having a visual roadmap to get them done -- can have landmark effects.  Through my knowledge of key productivity tools, goal setting and spiritual prinicipals, and Evernote, the multi-use - productivity, GTD (Getting Things Done) and organizational tool, that helped me to propel an idea into a self-sustaining enterprise, I am designing my life.</p>
<p>I have <a href=""http://usabletech.co/page/bookstore"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">written four books</a> on Evernote/ Productivity and speak around the world about my personal application and helpful use cases that I have discovered - From Small Business to Blogging to even Healthcare. It has been my hope that readers will find ways to live the productive and fruitful lives they truly want to live, and save money as they go.</p>
<p>My latest book, 'The Notable Mind' (working title) hopes to explore how by organizing thoughts, goals and desires in Evernote, its 3rd Party apps, and other key productivity tools, you can realize whatever you want. This will be my most powerful and impactful book yet!</p>

<p>My name is Jonathan Rotondo.  I'm a journalist, writer, pilot and aerobatic instructor.  In February of 2012, my dad was taken by cancer.  He was 66. You may think that young - but he did an incredible amount of living in that relatively short time.  After he died, I was moved to track down an old, red and white homebuilt airplane that he owned when I was very young.  I spent my days sitting in that airplane, dreaming of the day when I would take to the skies for real...and not by fancy and imagination. </p>
<p>So, I embarked on this journey - one that was both uplifting and crushing.  I met people who knew my dad in his younger days, I heard stories, relived memories and grew to know him on a level I never could achieve when he was with us.  As my project grew, I began documenting my journey on a blog.  The blog grew into a series of articles and now, hopefully, with your help and generosity - a book.</p>
<p>My idea is to purchase a similar Smith Miniplane, retrace my dad's flights and write about my experiences...weaving them into my dad's narrative.</p>
<p>Of course, you will get to ride along.</p>
<p>Please visit the blog at <a href=""http://findingffam.blogspot.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://findingffam.blogspot.ca/</a></p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am hoping for $20,000 to help fund the acquisition of the airplane, the publication of the book and any costs associated with the project.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my complete goal, I will still use the funds towards the project.  This is something that I must do - and quickly.  There are only 5 Smith Miniplanes in Canada - and 2 are being rebuilt.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a story about life, love and loss...a story anyone can relate to.  Following the publication of the articles, I received dozens of emails from perfect strangers telling me how the story touched them.  There is a little bit of all of us in this story.  By helping me realize this, you'd be helping me make a monument to anyone who has suffered loss and potentially inspire others to do the same.</p>
<p>Positive stories always effect change - even a simple smile or a tear.  Help me heal myself...and others.</p>

<p><strong> For those who are looking to join us and contribute towards meeting our second stage goal...please visit the link below!<br/></strong></p>
<h2><a href=""http://igg.me/p/483710/x/2070433"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NEW INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN PAGE <br/></a></h2>
<p>What an amazing 31 days we've had. From July 1st to August 1st, We raised $13,772! Woowhoo! When I was doing the campaign, many people asked me, why only 31 days? I think it's important we START things. Not just talk about them. The 31 days allowed us the ability to garner some of the resources we needed to get going. Now we can get to the actual DOING of the project while simultaneously fundraising. This project will not happen over night, but must be worked on continuously on all fronts from the fundraising, to the research, to the writing to the editing.</p>
<p><strong>With your initial contributions( minus the indiegogo fees and credit card fees)  the plan is to build the website, start initial recipe and regional research, schedule  initial trip to Haiti, secure lodging and accomodations, hire a photographer, hire a guide, and keep pushing for this project to come to light as beautifully as you and I envision. This will be a journey for us all. Myself included. I look to you all for guidance, support and information.</strong></p>
<p>Still want to contribute and found out about this too late? VISIT Our new campaign page and keep up with whats new, and developing.Also encourage you to join our facebook page Haiti Uncovered.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<p>This next is to help us secure the remaining part of the funding we sought out for on indiegogo. Many individuals have called and texted about how they can contribute. This provides a good platform.  You still have a chance to participate and be part of history. How amazing is it to open a book anywhere in the world, to know you ARE the reason that it is here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><span><strong>Part of Proceeds from this book will go to benefit two amazing organizations:  Haiti Cultural Exchange and Community2Community, check out the phenomenal work they do.</strong></span></em></p>

 For those who are looking to join us and contribute towards meeting our second stage goal...please visit the link below!
NEW INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN PAGE 
What an amazing 31 days we've had. From July 1st to August 1st, We raised $13,772! Woowhoo! When I was doing the campaign, many people asked me, why only 31 days? I think it's important we START things. Not just talk about them. The 31 days allowed us the ability to garner some of the resources we needed to get going. Now we can get to the actual DOING of the project while simultaneously fundraising. This project will not happen over night, but must be worked on continuously on all fronts from the fundraising, to the research, to the writing to the editing.
With your initial contributions( minus the indiegogo fees and credit card fees)  the plan is to build the website, start initial recipe and regional research, schedule  initial trip to Haiti, secure lodging and accomodations, hire a photographer, hire a guide, and keep pushing for this project to come to light as beautifully as you and I envision. This will be a journey for us all. Myself included. I look to you all for guidance, support and information.
Still want to contribute and found out about this too late? VISIT Our new campaign page and keep up with whats new, and developing.Also encourage you to join our facebook page Haiti Uncovered.
 
This next is to help us secure the remaining part of the funding we sought out for on indiegogo. Many individuals have called and texted about how they can contribute. This provides a good platform.  You still have a chance to participate and be part of history. How amazing is it to open a book anywhere in the world, to know you ARE the reason that it is here.
 
 
Part of Proceeds from this book will go to benefit two amazing organizations:  Haiti Cultural Exchange and Community2Community, check out the phenomenal work they do.
My goal is not to innovate, it is simply to contribute. It is to bring the missing piece to a puzzle in construction.
Greetings friends, I am Nadege Fleurimond, owner and operator of Fleurimond Catering Inc. an off-premise catering company operating in NY.
THE PROJECT: HAITI UNCOVERED
Today, I consider myself privileged to invite you to be part of a beautiful and worthwhile project that is vital to maintaning our heritage and culture. I have worked on a lot of projects, many of them my own, but I have never felt the need, nor the desire to ask for assistance outside of my small circle of friends and collaborators. This time, this project is too important to undertake alone. I need you to be part of it.
Rarely have I been as excited about a project as I am about this one. In partnership with you, I want to create, a Culinary Coffee Table Book that embraces every region and tradition of Haiti. Haiti Uncovered: A Regional Adventure into the Art of Haitian Cuisine will bring into focus the beauty of Haiti through its diverse culinary traditions. The beautifully bound and illustrated, hard cover book, slated to be released in early 2014, will present and represent the dishes and cooking traditions from the major geographical Departments. 
 
The book will have an English as well as a French Version making it accessible to individuals all over the globe. 
Author Edwidge Danticat is excited about this project and will be writing the forward for the book. 
Why This Book Needs to be Created?
In my opinion, Food is perhaps one of the most important things within a culture. As Regine Roumain, Executive Director of Haiti Cultural Exchange states, ""It is an important and vital aspect of our cultural heritage and one I think should be preserved. Everything having to do with food from the preparation to the cultivation to the way we eat altogether is a cultural act. Food is culture""
Fan Fan TiBot, Founding member and Manager of Tabou Combo, also states, ""Haitians are known for music and mostly painting. But not for our cuisine. Based on our different colinization, I think Haiti has the most culturally diversified cuisine in the Caribbean. I like the project because it promotes our culture""
Showcasing Haiti has been at the forefront of everything that I have done to this point in my life and my career.  I want to use the skills that I have been blessed with to leave behind something that is needed.
Haiti Uncovered will be a book that Haitians born in Haiti can reference to learn about other parts of the country.
Haitians and Haitian-Americans in the Diaspora can learn the real breadth and scope  of Haitian cuisine . Not just Du riz ak pwa. This sense that Haitian food is limited, is a fallacy. 
When Non-Haitians are interested in learning about Haiti, Haitian culture, and what the culinary culture of Haiti is really about, they can google, and find Haiti Uncovered, that gives a true depiction of the reality.
I read on an internet blog once, about someone who had moved to Haiti and they wrote, ""Haitians put ketchup and sugar in their spaghetti. Haitians really like sweet foods. They put sugar in everything."" 
That statement really bothered me because, while I may not know our full culinary tradition, one I am very clear about is, we do not like sweet and savory flavors for the most part, yet, the people reading this woman's blog would use her thoughts as a reference, and there is nothing out there to counter that. 
We need to change that. We need to ensure that we have a complete and well presented piece of writing that will serve as a culinary, cultural and historical reference for Haiti.
 
Haiti Uncovered can serve people all over the world who are interested in a creating a sort of cultural exchange. 
However, I can’t do this alone. Only a true and complete collaborative effort on many fronts can make that possible. Therefore, I need you. I need your backing and encouragement. Together, we will produce something that we can all be proud of. This book, with your participation, will become the culinary reference for Haitians and non-Haitians alike who are interested in Haitian Cuisine.
Why Do I Need You on this Journey?  
I want you to love this project as much as I do. I want you to travel the course with me. Such an undertaking will require extensive travelling and research throughout the country to speak with the people, discover and study the recipes, so that they can be reported as accurately as possible to you and the world. It will feature not only beautiful photographs of dishes and recipes, but will also include photographs of the people and will reveal in detail their food traditions, as well as locally grown ingredients. Haiti Uncovered: A Regional Adventure into the Art of Haitian Cuisine is a book that will present an accurate depiction of Haiti's culinary art. In essence, this is your chance to rediscover Haiti and to present her in a different light.
What Your Financial Support Will Mean:
 
27,500 is the minimum needed to get this project going in the right direction. However the project costs are well over $40,000. Proper research and travelling will be necessary to capture the rich culinary heritage of Haiti. 
What does a day look like in Jacmel when looked through a food inspired lens? 
What do the people of Jeremie eat on Sundays? 
What is the festival or street food culture in Cap-Haitien? 
Wedding foods of Miragoane?
From religion to other societal components, what role does food play in the lives of Haitian. 
By contributing financially to the realization of this Book Project, you will permit the hiring of knowledgable and competent  professionals in all relams. From videographers, copy editors, researches, historians to the photographers that wil capture the people, the dishes and the agricultural back drop of the country. 
 
Even in presenting this video to you and bringing this project to your attention, we wanted to do our best to bring something of quality. We want to continue on this path. Research has to be done and we need to go to Haiti. Numerous times. We need to visit various regions to perform adequate researchproperly document data.  We will need to print this book and more importantly, we will need to ensure that the marketing and publicity campaigns are well developed and carried out. Your contribution will make all that possible. 
We also have some great perks available for your generosity.  Check them out!
What the Book Means  
For many Haitian descents and foreigners, Haitian food means Rice and Beans, Fried chicken, Tasso (seasoned fried goat), Griot (seasoned fried pork), fried fish with the occasional fried plantain. 
 
But Haitian Food, well Haitian Cuisine is much more than those common dishes. It is also Tom tom, bouyon tèt kabrit, tchaka, and ragou pyé bèf. It is pitimi ak pwa, soup joumou, pwason gwo sèl, lalo, blé, labouyi banana, doukounou, mousa, koukoush, and much more. 
 
It is also dessert items like dous kokoyé, chanmchanm, konparèt, dous makòs, tablèt nwa, tablet pistach, pain patate, gato manyok, bon bon sirop, beignet, and a lot more. 
 
Think of learning about Cachiman, Corossol, kenep, mango, sapoti, lam veritab, labapen, acajou, and Djon djon, among others. 
 
We want to represent the daily culinary experience of those in Jeremie, Gonaives, Les Cayes, Cap-Haitien, Jacmel, Port-de-Paix and others. We want to know the people. We want to know their food traditions, so we can perhaps pass down to our children. 
 
With this book, we have a chance to represent our cuisine and traditions the right way and in context of our history and reality.
 
How much will all of this Project Cost us?
The project cost ranges from $40,000.00 to $60,000 depending on how extensive we want to make this. I have thought of adding a DVD Guide along with the book. However, all of that depends on how much we are able to raise.  I have already secured $8,000.00 in commitment towards the printing of the Book. I have committed $11,000 of my own funds towards this endeavor, however, I cannot do it alone. I am coming to you and the Indiegogo community for atleast $27, 500.00 as I continue to search for the money to make this project as amazing as it deserves to be. If we are able to raise more, the better the project will be. 
Author Edwidge Dandicat has landed her support to the project by agreeing to write the forward of the book. Others have already promised support of other kind. We need your support. Contribute to this project and help us create something which  truly represents the country that we know and love.
Part of proceeds from this book will benefit Haiti Cultural Exchange and Community2Community. The work these two organizations do here and in Haiti is beyond phenomenal. 
How Can you Help? 
Donate!!! Donate today, then come back another day and donate again. It is important that this project spreads, and the only way that will happen is if you contribute and ask others to do the same.
It is imperative that we keep the donations constant and consistent. This project has the ability to get great backing and support if the initial support is there. 
So please keep encouraging your friends, family and colleagues to support this and help us bring this project to fruition.

<p><b>HAVE YOU EVER READ <i>THE PILGRIM'S PROGRESS</i>?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>John Bunyan's famous
allegory, <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>, is
one of the most read books in the English language, second only to the King
James Version of the Holy Bible.</p>
<p>Today, however, there is a
generation of Christians who have never read <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>.<span> Some have attempted to read it, but seventeenth century
puritanical English was much too difficult for the reader to grasp. Others may have read a more updated and modern version of John Bunyan's
allegory, yet for them, the book needed more explanation or commentary.</span></p>
<p>I am attempting to solve those problems with a slight twist by creating a book that goes beyond a mere modern
translation: a new work, which will provide particular insights into Bunyan's famous story
without diminishing the allegory with a great deal of doctrinal commentary
thrown in here and there to disrupt the poetic beauty of the work… and I'll do
this by writing a novel entitled, <i>To Be a
Pilgrim: A Novel Based Upon The Pilgrim's Progress and Other Works by John
Bunyan of Bedford</i>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>TO
BE A PILGRIM</i> AND WHY I'M CREATING IT</b></p>
<p>Because
my closest friends and associates in ministry know me as one who has read <i>The Pilgrim's Progress </i>approximately
twice per year since about 1986, and also as one who has been greatly
ministered to by the written works of John Bunyan, the wife of a dear friend asked
me to edit and publish a new modern translation of <i>The
Pilgrim's Progress </i>so that her home-schooled children could enjoy the famous
allegory without having to learn Cromwellian English.</p>
<p>As
one who loves the book, second only to the Bible itself, I was quite flattered
but adamant that the endeavor to embark upon such a project was something to
which I was so ill-qualified. I initially reasoned that <br/></p><ul><li>(1) there were already
so many other modern translations available; and <br/>
</li></ul><ul><li>(2), I didn't believe that I
could ever write a modern edition that could maintain the power and impact of
the original.</li></ul><p>During
this last Christmas and the New Year, I was sick for the week covering December
25, 2013 with a fever of 103-104 degrees F. I was well enough to preach at
Sovereign Grace Baptist Church on December 29th, but had developed pneumonia so
that I required inoculations from the Veteran's Administration Clinic on December
30th.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/425736/files/20140311013846-headline_igg_1.jpg?1394527126"" src="""" style=""""/></p>My
wife said that I was delirious during the days and nights with the high fever
(I was later scolded by the nurse at the VA for not going to the Emergency Room
when my fever was that high). I do remember one of my dreams when I was
feverish, and in it, I was in the Bedford Jail with John Bunyan, the preacher
of Bedford. We conversed in my dream and I seemed to remember I dreamed as if he
were telling me the ""dream"" he dreamed; that is, he told me the story
of <i>The Pilgrim's Progress</i>. Certainly,
it was merely my subconscious mind in the state of delirium, but afterwards, it
prompted me to think about telling that story in order to tell Bunyan's.<p></p>
<p><b>ABOUT THE
BOOK,<i> TO BE A PILGRIM</i></b></p>
<p>In novel form, the presentation of John Bunyan's great allegory can be
told while maintaining the power, impact and poetic beauty of the original classic. Alternate chapters also present fictionalized conversations with Bunyan, which provides some additional commentary and doctrinal insights into the story overall.</p>
<p><b>WHY IS THIS BOOK UNIQUE?</b></p>
<p>This
book is unique because of the story within the story in order to convey in word
pictures and allegorical form the ""Old Story"" of the gospel of Jesus
Christ. In this way, the story itself may be told in a modern way, maintain the
doctrinal truths that Bunyan initially desired to convey (which is the most
important thing), and provide some additional commentary through the natural
flow of the narrative in order to give the clearest presentation to the reader.</p>
<p>Certainly,
a work like this will not be without its critics, cavilers and opposition. Mr.
Bunyan knew that he would have them as well, and wrote is poetic defense prior
to <i>The Pilgrim's Progress'</i> first
publication in 1678. Some of the objections today may be addressed in typical
Bunyan fashion right here:</p>
<ul><li>
<i>Objection:</i> Wouldn't an allegory actually oppose the straight-forward
proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ?</li></ul><ul><li>
<i>Answer:</i><span>  First, as Mr.
Bunyan's chief justification was the scriptures themselves, Hosea 12:10 and its
use of the word 'similitude' being the primary truth, we should recognize that
God's normal and ordinary means for advancing the gospel was through the agency
of redeemed men, preaching itself from the pulpits is rather allegorical, is it
not? The preacher takes God's truths and explains them by use of corresponding
scriptures, as well as word pictures and illustrations in order to convey them
to his hearers. Second, the ""dark sayings"" of Christ in parable,
produce the same effect as an allegory, to get those whom God has called, or is
calling, to get themselves alone with Christ so that He could expound the
meaning to His disciples (Mark 4:33-34). Third, although the allegory may have
an effect upon unbelievers, the novel, like the Bible, is written primarily to
believers, so that those who have been saved by grace through faith may be
provoked to pursue more deeply the things of Christ.</span>

<p>Hello, my name is Ken Foster, and several months ago I started a small company called Fictivity Press.  Despite the name, we don't actually publish books, though. Our mission is to mentor emerging genre fiction authors and guide them through the often bewildering world of self-publishing.  We assemble a team of editors, artists, and other creative types to prepare our authors' books for successful launches, and we also help raise the funds to pay for these necessary services.  Then we turn the finished manuscript back over to the author so he or she can self-publish and keep 100% of their royalties.</p>
<p>I've talked with hundreds of indie authors and I've found that nearly all of them recognize the need for professional editing and other prepublication services, but they're reluctant to invest thousands on a book that might never return such an investment. Instead, they often resort to self-editing and cobbling together an amateurish cover on their own.  After months or even years of pouring their hearts into a labor of love, their publishing dreams come crashing down in a heap of unrealized potential.  <br/></p>
<p>I wanted to change all that, and that is why I started Fictivity Press.  In a nutshell, I want writers to write, editors to edit, and artists to make art, and I want everyone to get paid for their efforts.  Crazy, right?</p>
<p>But I'm not here to ask you to help Fictivity Press, at least not directly. I'm here to introduce you to our inaugural BookLaunch project and to a deserving indie author named Pete Oxley.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/387050/files/20140222091058-story.jpg?1393089058"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>""In the Fifteenth Century, the Aether held the universe together. In the Nineteenth Century, it just might tear it apart.""</i></p>
<p>Submitted for your approval, The Infernal Aether is the debut historical sci-fi/fantasy novel by Pete Oxley. Drawing inspiration from such writers as H.G. Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and K.W. Jeter, Pete Oxley has created a concept blending Victorian Era science fiction, adventure, fantasy, and horror, with a Wellsian Jekyll/Hyde duality theme and a chaotic Lovecraftian evil.</p>
<blockquote>Augustus Merriwether Potts is an itinerant writer who has squandered the bulk of a sizable inheritance and come to rest in the raucous melancholy of Victorian London's dismal East End. Having failed to achieve any prominence as a writer, his prospects fading, Augustus dulls the pain with the earthy pleasures of taverns, fallen women, and laudanum. His older brother Maxwell, though aloof and often disagreeable,
reluctantly renders support—and ultimately draws the puckish Augustus into his unnerving investigations into the supernatural. An inventor of sorts, Maxwell has begun to harness the unfathomable mystic power of aether, the fabled Fifth Element. Soon, a chance encounter with an extraordinary stranger called N'yotsu will touch off a breathtaking series of remarkable events, revealing a bizarre realm of malevolent power and unlocking the secrets of that dark quintessence: The Infernal Aether.</blockquote>
<p>Pete has had this story percolating in his fevered mind for
years and has finally succeeded in the first, most difficult part of 
publishing a book, which is actually getting that first draft finished. 
It's a kind of scifi/fantasy/horror mashup set in Victorian London.  It features a rollicking 
storyline, a menacing antagonist, and a host of other compelling characters—including one with a secret buried so deep it's a mystery even to him. 
Pete has written some nonfiction but (as this is his first attempt at 
fiction) the plot could use tidying up for maximum impact. The book will also need final line editing, formatting, and of course, a great cover. We're also hoping to raise a modest promotional fund Pete can use to market his book. The manuscript has already been meticulously analyzed by 
professional beta readers, and the remainder of the work will begin 
shortly after the IndieGoGo campaign closes.</p>
<p>Your contribution will not only help Pete achieve his dream
of becoming a professional writer, it will help lay the groundwork for our
larger goal of helping storytellers tell better stories and reach a wider
audience.  Any contribution or other show of support you can give will pay dividends for years to come.</p>

<p>""I wasn't sure whether I ought to like this or not, but in the end I found it quite impossible not to.""</p>
<p>""An elegant and chilling indulgence!""</p>
<p>""Nice work. Well written and easy to get into; it reminded me a lot of E O Higgins, or Caraticus P. Holbrook's latest.""</p>
<p>""Having lived in London, your descriptions of Hyde Park brought on bouts of nostalgia.""</p>
<p>""Rather had me in mind of the old Hammer House of Horrors movies… pity Vincent Price and Christopher Lee are no longer with us.""</p>

<p>Pete Oxley is a freelance writer and business manager who lives in the English Home Counties. He enjoys reading and writing in a wide range of areas but his main passions are sci-fi, fantasy, historical fiction
and steampunk.  His influences include H.G. Wells, Charles Dickens, Neil Gaiman, K. W. Jeter, Scott Lynch, Clive Barker, Pat Mills and Joss Whedon. He is the author of the nonfiction book ""The Wedding Speech Manual."" Pete lives with his wife, two young sons and a slowly growing guitar collection. Aside from writing and willingly speaking in front of large crowds of strangers, Pete spends his spare time playing music badly, supporting football teams that play badly, and writing about himself in the third person.</p>

<p>The Infernal Aether project will be accomplished by a team
of creative and industry professionals, most of whom have promised to keep
unproductive bickering to a minimum:</p><p>
</p><p>Angela Amman and Stephanie Ayers (Bannerwing Betas): Beta
reading and dispensing of unpleasant truths</p>
<p>John Harten (EditWorks and GenrePub): Developmental editing

<p>D. L. Mackenzie (Author of The Magnetron Chronicles): Victorian
voice coaching and clumsy moral support</p>
<p>Ken Foster (Fictivity Press): Project management, sweating
of deadlines, airing of grievances</p>
<p>The 99Designs Community: Cover art and design</p>
<p>The IndieGoGo Community: Invaluable contributions and random
acts of kindness</p>

<p>Preparing a book isn't cheap, but we've done everything possible to create a realistic budget that doesn't sacrifice quality.  The total initial budget is USD $3,100, or approximately GBP £1,860.</p>

<p>As a Fictivity Press BookLaunch Project, The Infernal Aether has strong potential for success. We have a time-bound project plan in place and a project team standing ready to begin work. We are using IndieGoGo's flexible funding option to ensure that we will have funds available to start the wheels turning, and the author has pledged funds of his own to help make up budgetary shortfalls. We request prioritized, variable-scope proposals from our providers, giving us the flexibility to adjust to a smaller-than-anticipated budget and still yield professional results.</p>
<p>Even with these measures in place, we recognize that an unexpectedly poor response to our crowdfunding campaign may jeopardize the project. Therefore, if the campaign fails to raise an amount sufficient to produce a quality publication, we pledge to shelve the project and issue refunds upon request.</p>

Chapters from the initial draft of The Infernal Aether have been published on Wattpad, Jottify, MyWritersCircle, and YouWriteOn to gauge
reader interest and garner feedback from Pete’s fellow writers (take a peek for yourself). Here are just a few of the many comments received:

""Very interesting opening chapter, reminds me a lot of the Newbury and Hobbs investigations and The Case of Spring-Heeled Jack… by no means a bad thing!""
""Oh, is that ever creepy! Nicely done!""

Pete Oxley is a freelance writer and business manager who lives in the English Home Counties. He enjoys reading and writing in a wide range of areas but his main passions are sci-fi, fantasy, historical fiction
and steampunk.  His influences include H.G. Wells, Charles Dickens, Neil Gaiman, K. W. Jeter, Scott Lynch, Clive Barker, Pat Mills and Joss Whedon. He is the author of the nonfiction book ""The Wedding Speech Manual."" Pete lives with his wife, two young sons and a slowly growing guitar collection. Aside from writing and willingly speaking in front of large crowds of strangers, Pete spends his spare time playing music badly, supporting football teams that play badly, and writing about himself in the third person.
The Infernal Aether has been accepted as a Fictivity Press BookLaunch Project and needs your help to pay for editing, original cover art, and other professional services to polish it for publication and prepare it for a successful launch. We have solicited proposals, created a budget and project schedule, and assembled a team of professionals to take Pete's manuscript from draft to publication in ebook and print formats. After the project is complete, we will also shop the story to various small traditional presses and audiobook voice talent.

The Infernal Aether project will be accomplished by a team
of creative and industry professionals, most of whom have promised to keep
unproductive bickering to a minimum:
Angela Amman and Stephanie Ayers (Bannerwing Betas): Beta
reading and dispensing of unpleasant truths
John Harten (EditWorks and GenrePub): Developmental editing
and general wizardry
D. L. Mackenzie (Author of The Magnetron Chronicles): Victorian
voice coaching and clumsy moral support
Ken Foster (Fictivity Press): Project management, sweating
of deadlines, airing of grievances
The 99Designs Community: Cover art and design
The IndieGoGo Community: Invaluable contributions and random
acts of kindness
You truly are the key to the success of this project. Without your support, the rest of us can't even get started.

Preparing a book isn't cheap, but we've done everything possible to create a realistic budget that doesn't sacrifice quality.  The total initial budget is USD $3,100, or approximately GBP £1,860.
Estimate of all costs in US dollars:


Professional Beta Reading
$144.00


Developmental Editing
$960.00


Line Editing
$240.00


Cover Art/Design
$299.00


Promotional Budget
$200.00


Project Fees
$184.00


IndieGoGo Platform Fees
$285.00


Payment Processing
$127.00


Backer Perks
$670.00


TOTAL
$3109.00

Funds raised above the funding goal will be put mostly into additional marketing and promotional activities. If we come up short, the project can still proceed as explained below.

As a Fictivity Press BookLaunch Project, The Infernal Aether has strong potential for success. We have a time-bound project plan in place and a project team standing ready to begin work. We are using IndieGoGo's flexible funding option to ensure that we will have funds available to start the wheels turning, and the author has pledged funds of his own to help make up budgetary shortfalls. We request prioritized, variable-scope proposals from our providers, giving us the flexibility to adjust to a smaller-than-anticipated budget and still yield professional results.
Even with these measures in place, we recognize that an unexpectedly poor response to our crowdfunding campaign may jeopardize the project. Therefore, if the campaign fails to raise an amount sufficient to produce a quality publication, we pledge to shelve the project and issue refunds upon request.

<p>  Like many children his age, little Timmy Lee is very nervous to go to his first day of school, where he will meet all new children. He then discovers written letters that pop up in hidden places, starting at his bus stop. These letters introduce Timmy to new adventures that, in a way, make him forget all about his fear of his first day. These letters that Timmy Lee finds have clever riddles building up to the next adventure. The reader actually has to open the letter themselves in order to see the riddle inside. This allows the reader to feel that they are Timmy Lee in the story, and the adventure comes alive right off the page! </p>

<p><b>WHO AM I</b></p>
<p>I am Dane Figueroa Edidi better know as Lady
Dane. I am a Nigerian, Cuban, Cherokee Trans woman, Performance artist, gender
consultant, teacher, and writer. I have written Yemaya's Daughter, in which one
of the main characters is Trans in response to the inherent trans-phobia and
fema-phobia I witnessed in countries in which trans and queer people were
originally honored and in many cases revered. I began work on this piece
in December 2012 and am excited to finally have it finished.  My campaign is to raise funds to self-publish
Yemaya's Daughters. </p>
<p><b>ABOUT THE NOVEL</b></p>
<p>Inanna Au-set Oya, a trans-woman,
priestess, and storyteller with deep connections to the goddess,
emerges from a province in Africa untouched by colonialist hands to find a
world twisted with misconception and pain. She and her sisters choose to go
forth and correct the imbalances found by ushering in an age of love and worth.</p>
<p>Maryam, mother of Jesus, holds fast to her
convictions, when from tragedy is born a new god. Without sisters, or guidance
for her choices she finds a world under roman foot and is determined to create
a spiritual revolt that will create ripples for ages to come.</p>
<p>Yemaya's daughter’s tells the tale of two
different women with one goal in mind: how best to change the world without
losing themselves in the process.</p>
<p><b>What
I NEED</b></p>
<p> I need $20,000 for my first go round.
First so that I can print multiple novels at once and secondly to prove to the
world that a work like this, is both wanted, and can be supported. Through your
support you help to plant the seed in the mind of people all over the world
that artistic Trans work is both desired, needed and marketable. </p>
<p>We have 3 different perks for you to pre-order
books so that you are receiving something for all you do. Thank you so much for
all the love. </p>
<p><b>IMPACT</b></p>
<p>Yemaya's Daughters is about women, All women.
This novel is about breaking illusions and stereotypes we have placed around
gender, sexuality, sensuality and religion. It is an empowerment piece with a
radical twist. It is a love story about two friends who never thought they
could find love. It is about the joy of family and the pain of family. It is
about the falsehoods of history and the enlightenment of history we seem to
have forgotten. It is about you, me, she and everyone's journey to love, self-worth,
spirit identity and truth. And lastly is about sisterhood, ones found in our
DNA and in others found in our choosing; it is about women helping women, being
women and living fully vested in their womanhood.</p>

Asking for help and support for anything involving uncharted creative territory is never easy. However, as technology explodes and changes traditional careers, we all face a need to think outside the proverbial box. As some of you know, I am a photographer, schooled and trained in a visual craft that changed the world. Photography united people and nations and offered global access to issues unavailable to most before the advent of the printing press. Leaders, products and places, and natural disasters were captured by the photographer’s eye and lens. As single frame photography gave way to digital imaging, I evolved with the industry and developed a series of documentary films such as “Marymount Again...”,  “Maybe the Big Rabbit Did It?” and my last film, the critically acclaimed “Cracked Not Broken”, a documentary that has educated thousands of students in Toronto and was featured on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 2006 and was one of four independent films selected to be part of HBO’s award winning ‘Addiction Series’ the following year. I have a half dozen or so more films that I have not yet brought to life that continue to evolve including “Looking for Rasta” based on a photograph I took twenty years ago in Jamaica and “ Fahrenheit 9/22 "" about Canadian artist John Coburn’s book of 9/11 drawings called “Healing Hearts”.  So, what is the point of all this? It was clear to me that in order to remain creative, I had to adapt and use the latest available technology. Today technology is destroying more jobs than it creates and there are many careers that will face the same dilemma as the photographers soon. Those of us who have made photography and filmmaking our life’s work have been left feeling disillusioned and undervalued by today’s digital world.

<h2><span>The ""Tell me more but be brief"" version</span></h2>
<h3>
<span lang=""en-CA"">I'm </span><span lang=""en-IE"">on a quest to get kids interested in reading again! </span>
</h3>
<p lang=""en-IE"">There's a lot of great stories out there for kids - my concern is for the kids that have been left out due to underdeveloped visualization skills.</p>
<p><span lang=""en-IE"">I'm creating a series of electronic books that are accessible to children of all ages - books that are designed to</span><em><strong><span lang=""en-US""> </span><span lang=""en-US"">improve the reader's imaginative skills</span></strong></em><span lang=""en-US"">,</span><span lang=""en-US""> </span><span lang=""en-IE"">which I believe will make reading a more enjoyable experience for them. </span><span lang=""en-US""> </span><span lang=""en-IE"">I'm a father of 4 and I've been in the animation industry for close to 30 years - I know how to entertain kids and I understand how difficult it can be to instill a love of reading in them.</span></p>
<p lang=""en-IE"">I believe that the joy of reading is completely dependent on one's ability to visualize.  A child with a vivid imagination can feel completely immersed in a story - they feel like they are right there in the environment that they are reading about, complete with sights, sounds, smells and emotions. To a child with a poorly developed imagination, the same story is experienced like a poorly drawn picture book.</p>
<p lang=""en-IE"">Kids can only improve their imagination by using it on a regular basis. My plan is to create a series of books that kickstart a child's imagination without taking it over completely, by using a combination of high quality illustrations, music and a short sequence of Disney quality animation (with dialogue) on every page.</p>
<p><span lang=""en-IE"">The illustration shows them what the characters and setting look like; the music sets the emotional tone and the animation shows them how the characters move, sound and behave. The environmental sounds in the animation let them know what it sounds like to really be there. Unlike a movie, which would serve all of this up for the viewer continuously, thereby hijacking their imagination, the animation in my books will illustrate one single event on that page - it's up to the reader to imagine all the other events on the rest of the page. </span><span lang=""en-US""> </span><span lang=""en-IE"">All I have done is given them something to latch onto so they don't have to come up with it all themselves if their imagination is not ready for that.</span></p>
<p lang=""en-IE"">Each story is offered in multiple languages and in three different age appropriate versions within the one book app - from toddlers to young adults.</p>
<p lang=""en-US"">I've teamed up with fantasy illustrator Den Beauvais to create our first book - <strong><em>The Reluctant Dragon. </em></strong>We're going for a style similar to the Ladybird books of the 1960's - detailed, yet not too polished, with warmth and heart<span lang=""en-US""> </span><span lang=""en-CA""> </span></p>
<p>We will be giving a percentage of the money we collect from the Indiegogo campaign <em><strong>and</strong></em> a percentage from <em><strong>all of our book sales</strong></em> to charities that support juvenile literacy. </p>

<h2><span>The ""Long-winded"" version - If you want more details and you've got the time</span></h2>
<h3><em>Raise your hand if you have a kid or know a kid that doesn't like to read. Yeah, that's what I thought - a sea of hands…</em></h3>
<p>My friends and I are creating a series of books unlike any children's books ever created! These books are designed to help kids of all ages develop their imagination skills and give them a love of reading. </p>
<p>We start with the basic ingredient of all great entertainment - <em><strong>a good story, well told.</strong></em> Our first several books are classic stories, known and loved by millions of people - stories that appeal to a wide age range, so young adults will be as interested as preschoolers.  <em><strong>The reader can choose their age level on the first page and it serves up the story in a version that is appropriate for them.</strong></em> Young adults can read the story as it was originally written, which may include archaic language and complex descriptions of setting and character. There is a version for children in the 7-12 range that simplifies the language and shortens the length of each page. The young children's version reduces the story down to a few simple lines per page.</p>
<p>There is high quality artwork on every page in the style of the old Ladybird books that were made in the 1960's. Our aim is to create illustrations with heart and great appeal without getting too caught up in fine detail. Den Beauvais is illustrating our first book, <em><strong>The Reluctant Dragon</strong></em> and his approach is exactly the look we are trying to achieve. His colours and lighting are dynamic and realistic while the detailing of faces and textures is kept minimal.</p>
<p><img alt=""pg 10 - first visit"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cobblestone-media.com/promos/Panel10.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""pg 10 - First Visit""/></p>
<p>Each page also turns into a short <em><strong>animated sequence</strong></em> in the same style as the illustrations. The animation is of extremely high quality but short in duration. It brings to life one action on the page, it's not as simple as an interactive book or a motion comic, nor as complex as a short film turned into a book. <em><strong>The whole point is to give the kids some help in visualizing the rest of the page but not to take over their imagination completely.</strong></em> We want to empower the children; urge them to read the rest of the page and use what they saw in the animation and illustration to help them visualize the characters and the environment in their head while reading. <em><strong>This will help develop their imagination and visualization skills, not just their recall of visuals that they have seen - they will be creating 90% of the visuals for themselves.</strong></em></p>
<p>There are many other features to this app, such as <em><strong>multiple languages</strong></em><span> </span>(written and spoken), the ability to record your own narration and share it between devices; a complete, symphonic soundtrack and much more!</p>
<p>We are actually creating 3 versions for each book - what I have been describing is what we call the deluxe app. We are also creating a lite version of the app that will not have the painted illustrations, animation or music. It will feature pen and ink illustrations in a classical style that I am creating myself. We are also producing an iBooks version that will use the pen and ink illustrations and only one version of the story - the young children's version. The iBooks version is very fast to produce and will be used to promote the full version.</p>
<h2><span>The Problem and the Solution</span></h2>
<p>Kids today don't seem to have the same ability to use their imagination as they did a generation ago.  I'm not a scientist, nor am I a sociologist - but I am a father of four and I know a lot of parents that tell the same story. They want their kids to develop a love of reading, yet <em><strong>they keep running up against the same wall - books don't hold their kid's interest as much as other forms of entertainment do.</strong></em></p>
<h3>Here's the problem as I see it:</h3>
<p>I grew up in the 70's. When we went out to play, we took our bikes or a couple of toys and we went out with our siblings or friends to invent worlds and scenarios in our minds. Sand dunes became alien worlds and a living room became an arena for Evil Kenevil to perform in. We developed our imaginations the same way we developed our muscles - by <span>USING</span> them! We had television as a distraction, but our parents were always at hand to regulate our use, so we didn't turn into ""vegetables"".  I don't hold with that notion - television can educate and inform but there is a problem with television and all of the other easily accessible forms of entertainment today.  TV, games, movies and internet videos all share one common feature - they are all the product of a single person's vision; usually the director. What you see is their imagination. <em><strong>The problem with kids watching too much of this kind of entertainment is that they don't have to use their own imagination at all.</strong></em> Later on, if they re-enact what they saw, they are using their <span>memory</span><span> </span>more than their imagination.  How much time do kids spend actually creating things in their mind that are their own? Much less than when I was growing up! <em><strong>If they don't use it, they won't develop it…</strong></em></p>
<p>When you read a book, you're able to imagine every character, setting, and event  your own way - it will always be perfectly attuned to your own tastes. However, if your imagination is stunted, your ability to visualize all the complexity in the book will be extremely limited. If children don't develop their imagination, how will they be able to see the characters moving and acting in their minds? How will they immerse themselves in the world's landscape - the smells and sounds; the feel of the deck moving under their feet; the summer wind from an alien world in their face? </p>
<h3><em><strong>Kids lose interest in books because their imagination lets them down. The solution to this is not to read more books, it's to have them do an imagination workout!</strong></em></h3>
<p>That's where our iPad books come in - they will bridge the gap between books and visual medium. Books with pictures are great - they help kids get an overall understanding of what things look like in part of the story <em><strong>but that's only one piece of information that they need.</strong></em><span> </span>What I propose is to create a book that gives kids more to work with but<em><strong> allows them to use this information to imagine the rest of the book for themselves.</strong></em></p>
<p>For example, on page 14 of our first book,The Reluctant Dragon,  (shown at the top of this page) the boy tries to explain to the dragon that he will be seen as a menace to society by the villagers, so he had better keep hidden. The dragon is so gentle natured that he can't believe that anyone would see him as an enemy or a threat. The illustration for that page portrays that setting quite well but we go one step further. If the reader touches the boy or the dragon, <em><strong>the image turns into a short movie clip of the dragon and boy having a short conversation, just like a movie,</strong></em> but it will only be one or two lines from the page, not all of it. There is music to set the mood of the situation, sound effects to give a sense of what the world sounds and feels like and the animation and voice acting will give a much more specific definition of the personality of the characters.</p>
<p>After the brief scene, the reader can use this as a template to help them visualize the remainder of the page as they read. <em><strong>Each page that they visualize for themselves helps to develop their power of visualization and increase their enjoyment of reading.</strong></em></p>

<h2><span>FAQ</span></h2>
<h3><span>Is this for iPad only?</span></h3>
<p>The iPad is our first target platform but we plan to make the books available on all iOS devices as well as an android version. If pledges go beyond our budget, we will set a stretch goal that will allow us to get these other versions ready much sooner.</p>
<h3><span>What languages are you planning to translate the books into?</span></h3>
<p>The plan is to hit the most popular languages first, then if there is a solid demand for another language, we can produce it and offer it as an update.  So far, we have all of the following languages in some stage of development:</p>
<p>English</p>
<p>French</p>
<p>Spanish</p>
<p>Chinese (simplified and traditional)</p>
<p>Japanese</p>
<p>Hindi</p>
<p>Arabic</p>
<p>Russian</p>
<p>German</p>
<p>Portuguese</p>
<p>I'd love to do an Irish version as well - there wouldn't be much demand for it, but hey, I'm an Irish citizen and I'd love to keep the language alive.</p>
<h3><span>Who are you guys? What have you done before?</span></h3>
<p>Here are some more complete bios for the principle members of our team:</p>
<h3><span>Chris Derochie</span></h3>
<p>I am the producer and director on this project as well as the writer, animator and illustrator of the pen and ink drawings.</p>
<p>I've been in animation for over 29 years (yeah, I said 28 in the video, but that part was filmed a while ago...) and I spent many of those years in traditional animation at companies like <em><strong>Don Bluth Studios, Disney</strong></em>, and many other studios large and small.

The ""Tell me more but be brief"" version

I'm on a quest to get kids interested in reading again! 

There's a lot of great stories out there for kids - my concern is for the kids that have been left out due to underdeveloped visualization skills.
I'm creating a series of electronic books that are accessible to children of all ages - books that are designed to improve the reader's imaginative skills, which I believe will make reading a more enjoyable experience for them.  I'm a father of 4 and I've been in the animation industry for close to 30 years - I know how to entertain kids and I understand how difficult it can be to instill a love of reading in them.
I believe that the joy of reading is completely dependent on one's ability to visualize.  A child with a vivid imagination can feel completely immersed in a story - they feel like they are right there in the environment that they are reading about, complete with sights, sounds, smells and emotions. To a child with a poorly developed imagination, the same story is experienced like a poorly drawn picture book.
Kids can only improve their imagination by using it on a regular basis. My plan is to create a series of books that kickstart a child's imagination without taking it over completely, by using a combination of high quality illustrations, music and a short sequence of Disney quality animation (with dialogue) on every page.
The illustration shows them what the characters and setting look like; the music sets the emotional tone and the animation shows them how the characters move, sound and behave. The environmental sounds in the animation let them know what it sounds like to really be there. Unlike a movie, which would serve all of this up for the viewer continuously, thereby hijacking their imagination, the animation in my books will illustrate one single event on that page - it's up to the reader to imagine all the other events on the rest of the page.  All I have done is given them something to latch onto so they don't have to come up with it all themselves if their imagination is not ready for that.
Each story is offered in multiple languages and in three different age appropriate versions within the one book app - from toddlers to young adults.
I've teamed up with fantasy illustrator Den Beauvais to create our first book - The Reluctant Dragon. We're going for a style similar to the Ladybird books of the 1960's - detailed, yet not too polished, with warmth and heart  
We will be giving a percentage of the money we collect from the Indiegogo campaign and a percentage from all of our book sales to charities that support juvenile literacy. 
 
The ""Long-winded"" version - If you want more details and you've got the time
Raise your hand if you have a kid or know a kid that doesn't like to read. Yeah, that's what I thought - a sea of hands…
My friends and I are creating a series of books unlike any children's books ever created! These books are designed to help kids of all ages develop their imagination skills and give them a love of reading. 
We start with the basic ingredient of all great entertainment - a good story, well told. Our first several books are classic stories, known and loved by millions of people - stories that appeal to a wide age range, so young adults will be as interested as preschoolers.  The reader can choose their age level on the first page and it serves up the story in a version that is appropriate for them. Young adults can read the story as it was originally written, which may include archaic language and complex descriptions of setting and character. There is a version for children in the 7-12 range that simplifies the language and shortens the length of each page. The young children's version reduces the story down to a few simple lines per page.
There is high quality artwork on every page in the style of the old Ladybird books that were made in the 1960's. Our aim is to create illustrations with heart and great appeal without getting too caught up in fine detail. Den Beauvais is illustrating our first book, The Reluctant Dragon and his approach is exactly the look we are trying to achieve. His colours and lighting are dynamic and realistic while the detailing of faces and textures is kept minimal.

Each page also turns into a short animated sequence in the same style as the illustrations. The animation is of extremely high quality but short in duration. It brings to life one action on the page, it's not as simple as an interactive book or a motion comic, nor as complex as a short film turned into a book. The whole point is to give the kids some help in visualizing the rest of the page but not to take over their imagination completely. We want to empower the children; urge them to read the rest of the page and use what they saw in the animation and illustration to help them visualize the characters and the environment in their head while reading. This will help develop their imagination and visualization skills, not just their recall of visuals that they have seen - they will be creating 90% of the visuals for themselves.
There are many other features to this app, such as multiple languages (written and spoken), the ability to record your own narration and share it between devices; a complete, symphonic soundtrack and much more!
We are actually creating 3 versions for each book - what I have been describing is what we call the deluxe app. We are also creating a lite version of the app that will not have the painted illustrations, animation or music. It will feature pen and ink illustrations in a classical style that I am creating myself. We are also producing an iBooks version that will use the pen and ink illustrations and only one version of the story - the young children's version. The iBooks version is very fast to produce and will be used to promote the full version.
The Problem and the Solution
Kids today don't seem to have the same ability to use their imagination as they did a generation ago.  I'm not a scientist, nor am I a sociologist - but I am a father of four and I know a lot of parents that tell the same story. They want their kids to develop a love of reading, yet they keep running up against the same wall - books don't hold their kid's interest as much as other forms of entertainment do.
Here's the problem as I see it:
I grew up in the 70's. When we went out to play, we took our bikes or a couple of toys and we went out with our siblings or friends to invent worlds and scenarios in our minds. Sand dunes became alien worlds and a living room became an arena for Evil Kenevil to perform in. We developed our imaginations the same way we developed our muscles - by USING them! We had television as a distraction, but our parents were always at hand to regulate our use, so we didn't turn into ""vegetables"".  I don't hold with that notion - television can educate and inform but there is a problem with television and all of the other easily accessible forms of entertainment today.  TV, games, movies and internet videos all share one common feature - they are all the product of a single person's vision; usually the director. What you see is their imagination. The problem with kids watching too much of this kind of entertainment is that they don't have to use their own imagination at all. Later on, if they re-enact what they saw, they are using their memory more than their imagination.  How much time do kids spend actually creating things in their mind that are their own? Much less than when I was growing up! If they don't use it, they won't develop it…
When you read a book, you're able to imagine every character, setting, and event  your own way - it will always be perfectly attuned to your own tastes. However, if your imagination is stunted, your ability to visualize all the complexity in the book will be extremely limited. If children don't develop their imagination, how will they be able to see the characters moving and acting in their minds? How will they immerse themselves in the world's landscape - the smells and sounds; the feel of the deck moving under their feet; the summer wind from an alien world in their face? 
Kids lose interest in books because their imagination lets them down. The solution to this is not to read more books, it's to have them do an imagination workout!
That's where our iPad books come in - they will bridge the gap between books and visual medium. Books with pictures are great - they help kids get an overall understanding of what things look like in part of the story but that's only one piece of information that they need. What I propose is to create a book that gives kids more to work with but allows them to use this information to imagine the rest of the book for themselves.
For example, on page 14 of our first book,The Reluctant Dragon,  (shown at the top of this page) the boy tries to explain to the dragon that he will be seen as a menace to society by the villagers, so he had better keep hidden. The dragon is so gentle natured that he can't believe that anyone would see him as an enemy or a threat. The illustration for that page portrays that setting quite well but we go one step further. If the reader touches the boy or the dragon, the image turns into a short movie clip of the dragon and boy having a short conversation, just like a movie, but it will only be one or two lines from the page, not all of it. There is music to set the mood of the situation, sound effects to give a sense of what the world sounds and feels like and the animation and voice acting will give a much more specific definition of the personality of the characters.
After the brief scene, the reader can use this as a template to help them visualize the remainder of the page as they read. Each page that they visualize for themselves helps to develop their power of visualization and increase their enjoyment of reading.

An Ongoing Gift to Charity
We will be donating a percentage of everything that we collect from this campaign and from the future sales of our books, to charities that support juvenile literacy.

More About the Rewards



Every sponsor gets access to special behind the scenes footage and artwork. Got tohttp://www.cobblestone-media.com/ and click on the Indiegogo link.

The Deluxe version of the app should be ready by the end of November. Since almost every reward includes a free version of the app, the delivery date for fulfilling the rewards has been set to November 30th.
The soundtrack album will be a digital download, not a physical cd. It will include a pdf booklet.
The animation training videos will be similar (but better!) than the training videos I used to make for Animation Mentor.com. Each video will be an hour long - they will start simple and will increase in complexity.
Video 1 - This will be about the basic theory of animation and how to get started in 3d or traditional animation.


Video 2 - Much more in-depth theory, covering physics and body mechanics.
Video 3 - Acting and timing for animation


Video 4 - deep concepts like texture and  flowing composition


The charity (or charities) that we will be partnering with hasn't been solidified yet. Once that is set and the percentage that we will give to them is decided on, we will announce it in an update.


Rather than shipping a 3d printed sculpture, we will be sending you the 3d file that can be brought or sent to any place that offers 3d printing services. 

Where Does the Money Go?
Den is creating 40 amazing paintings for The Reluctant Dragon and that will absorb a lot of the money. On top of that, we have to pay for the following services:


Animation, cleanup, colouring and compositing for the animated sequences on each page.
Translators and voice actors for each language we create.
Music for every page.


The recording studio to record the actors in.


The developer who will turn this into an actual working app.


The promotional website and blog
Sound design for the animated sequences
App interface design
Various software licenses


A percentage of all that we take in from this campaign will go to a juvenile literacy charity.

Where We Currently Stand


All character and set design is completed.
Den has created 14 paintings and is going strong!
Chris is well into the (digital) pen and ink illustrations.
Philip has written all the major themes and has been writing music for each page.


The three age level versions of the Reluctant Dragon are fully written and edited.
The text has been translated into Chinese (traditional and simplified), Japanese, and Spanish. Many others are in progress.


Narration for all three levels has been recorded in English and Chinese.
The character voices for the animation have been recorded for most of the English characters.


Our promotional website is nearly ready!

Other Ways to Help
The best way to help us is to spread the word! If you know of someone that is trying to encourage their child to read, send them to this site. Use the embed link under the video at the top of this page. If you know of someone that would be interested in one of the rewards we're offering, send them a message. Post a message on Facebook or send a tweet; repost our video or talk to your kids teachers - anything, just spread the word. The more people that know about this campaign, the better our chances of making this project a reality. Let's make this go viral and start a reading epidemic!
(Does anyone here know Oprah…?)
FAQ
Is this for iPad only?
The iPad is our first target platform but we plan to make the books available on all iOS devices as well as an android version. If pledges go beyond our budget, we will set a stretch goal that will allow us to get these other versions ready much sooner.
What languages are you planning to translate the books into?
The plan is to hit the most popular languages first, then if there is a solid demand for another language, we can produce it and offer it as an update.  So far, we have all of the following languages in some stage of development:
English
French
Spanish
Chinese (simplified and traditional)
Japanese
Hindi
Arabic
Russian
German
Portuguese
I'd love to do an Irish version as well - there wouldn't be much demand for it, but hey, I'm an Irish citizen and I'd love to keep the language alive.
Who are you guys? What have you done before?
Here are some more complete bios for the principle members of our team:
Chris Derochie
I am the producer and director on this project as well as the writer, animator and illustrator of the pen and ink drawings.
I've been in animation for over 29 years (yeah, I said 28 in the video, but that part was filmed a while ago...) and I spent many of those years in traditional animation at companies like Don Bluth Studios, Disney, and many other studios large and small. I worked on films like Thumbelina, A Goofy Movie and Help! I'm a Fish.  I ran my own animation studio, called The Forge, in Ireland for 10 years, and I have also been a visual effects animator for several years, animating on films like District  9, The Thing and the Twilight movies.  I have also done a lot of television work, like Stargate, Falling Skies and Eureka.  I'm currently the animation supervisor on the popular TV show, Once Upon a Time.
I have been nominated for an Emmy for my work on Stargate Universe. I supervised the animation on the second season of Steven Spielberg's Falling Skies, which was just nominated for a VES award (wish us luck!)
I taught animation for many years at Animation Mentor and at animation schools like The Animation Workshop in Denmark.

<h1><strong>Why should I pledge? Or even care?</strong></h1>
<p>You don't have to pledge, or even care. However, there have been many sad stories in the news over the last few years about those whose mental health illnesses get too much.</p>
<p>Remember Amanda Todd? She is just one of the millions of people that face the same things every day. Just because she became an online sensation doesn't mean that she didn't think/feel/cry the same way as everyone else.</p>

<p>If we go over our target then we would like to be able to print more books, as well as put some money aside for the book launch in May! </p>
<p><strong>ALL PROFITS OF THE BOOK WILL BE DIVIDED BY MIND, TIME TO CHANGE, THE MENTAL HEALTH FOUNDATION AND 2 SMALLER MENTAL HEALTH CHARITIES SOON TO BE ANNOUNCED.</strong></p>
<h1>About the writers</h1>
<p>The people that have been contributing their stories so far are from all around the World, from many different walks of life. All have one thing in common; a mental health illness. Some have got over them with incredible stories, others are still battling but doing some pretty amazing things.</p>
<p>All of these stories are being put together in book format by Rebecca (Bex) Walton who is a freelance writer from the UK. She has spent most of her writing career doing boring things in marketing, but has always wanted to write a book. Rebecca has agoraphobia (afraid of leaving the house) but wasn't just going to sit back and claim incapacity benefits. This project is going to prove that you can do it, I can do it, she can do it, and his dog can do it too.</p>

</div></div>","A lot of people don't realize that depression is an illness. I don't wish it on anyone, but if they would know how it feels, I swear they would think twice before they just shrug it. Jonathan Davis.
How many people do you think face mental health issues every day? That number in your head would probably need doubling before you got anywhere close. Depression, post traumatic stress disorder, Alzheimer's, bi-polar, anxiety, agoraphobia, eating disorders, ADHD, the list is completely endless. 
What do these people do to get by? Take tablets, see counsellors, get told it will ""all go away eventually.""
Others do some incredible things; such as become a celebrity, run a business or travel the World in a boat.
It is about time that these people's stories were told. In order to give inspiration to others, be recognised for their achievements and to help those who are also going through tough times. The Mental Health Struggle - From Agoraphobe to CEO is a book in the making that aims to put together all of these incredible people's stories. So far, we have over 100 real stories to sort through and thousands of real pictures. Once this is completed, it will become the most inspirational and motivational book of all time, the profits of which will be divided by several mental health charities.
About the book itself
The Mental Health Struggle - From Agoraphobe to CEO will be an A5 size book that has lots of stories, pictures and quotes. It's the kind of thing you would be able to pick up on the train, bus, toilet (if you fancy) and just read a part of. It's not going to be some long, boring novel that you have to read in any given order. That's the great thing about it, it is short bursts of inspiration and motivation! We like those words.
All of the profits from the book will be divided between 5 mental health charities which are:
Mind
Time To Change
The Mental Health Foundation
And two smaller charities which are currently being nominated by their supporters.
The cover and artwork is currently being designed by DesignMatic so we will update the project as soon as we have the final piece.

This is what an A5 looks like. See, like small but big.
The people who are sending in stories have also been sending in poetry, artwork they've done and even little gifts. How cool is that? It means that we can jam pack the book with as many exciting bits and bobs as possible. Plus it makes it much more exciting to read.
Rewards for getting involved
Please note: If you are outside the UK then add an extra £10 for postage on the heavier items (hardbacks, etc) and £5 for the paperback and smaller items.
If you just want a t-shirt or picture by Nick Smith then pledge £20 (+ postage if outside the UK) and send us a note. We will ship them out in February.
The most important thing in all this; what do I get?! 
Here's a breakdown of the rewards and what they mean:

</div></div>","Our Story

African
Voices, a quarterly
literary arts magazine, will celebrate its 20th Anniversary in 2012. Since 1992, African
Voices has published more than 700 writers, artists and playwrights.



We are a group of artists, writers
and editors committed to publishing a magazine that will connects readers with talented voices in literature and art.


Each issue of African
Voices is filled with an intoxicating mix of poetry, short stories,
fiction and art. It is one of the few literary magazines devoted to publishing
work by artists of color. The magazine also offers book reviews and feature
articles covering theater, film and the arts.
African Voices selects work by talented artists at the beginning of their careers and
provides a space for new artists to express themselves. Among those
writers African Voices has been privileged to publish
are: Pulitzer-prize winning novelist Junot DÃ­az 
(Spring 1996); Jeffery Renard Allen (Fall/Winter 2002), the author of Rails
Under; writer/playwright T. Tara Turk
(Spring/Summer 2008); Elizabeth Alexander (Fall/Winter 2002), the poet
selected for President Barack Obamaâ€™s 2008 inauguration celebration, appeared
in the Fall/Winter 2002 issue. 


The list of fabulously
gifted writers appearing on our pages, spanning two decades, is too long to
list here, but a few more are: David Mills, Anne Sterling Sutton, Miriam S.
Perez, Mercy Lee Tullis, Tyehimba Jess, Tara Betts, Sterling D. Plumpp, Louis
Reyes Rivera, Danny Simmons, C.D. Grant, Emily Raboteau, DenizÃ© Lauture, Willie
Perdomo, asha bandele, Ted Wilson, Ibi Zoboi, and Gary Johnston.






The Impact
Your contribution will help us pay the contributing fees to our writers and artists. The magazine is seeking
$5,000 towards a $30,000 fundraising goal that will help us publish four special 20th anniversary issues. The rest of the funding will
come from grants, fund-raising events and loyal donors who cherish the
publication.

No contribution is too small -- you may donate $1, $5 or $10. Please help by sharing our fundraising page with family, friends and colleagues.

Please continue to contribute to the success of this campaign
past the $5,000 goal. Why? You will bring us closer to
publishing four spectacular issues with more pages devoted to great fiction and
art.




What we do besides
publishing African Voices?
African Voices
Communications, Inc., the non-profit arts organization that publishes the
magazine, has a long history of supporting artists through several programs
that touch people as young as eight years old to seventy-five years young.
We believe the arts should impact peopleâ€™s lives and community
activism has been a vital part of our mission since the organizationâ€™s inception.
 
A brief outline of our
arts programming:
African Voices Cultural
Circle Conference: The Circle Conference, an annual forum that connects writers
and visual artists with the resources they need to pursue careers in publishing
and the arts. Photo above features Ronnique Hawkins, a writer who attended a
past Cultural Circle Conference.
Get Your Read On!: Young
people are introduced to storytelling and creative writing workshops that
nurture their interest in reading and writing.
African Voices Reading & Performance Series: The series
offers emerging writers a chance to develop their craft in weekly workshop
sessions and the reading series provides a chance for independent authors to
sell and share their work.
 
Reel Sisters Film of the
Diaspora Festival & Lecture Series: Annual film festival that presents
work directed, written or produced by women filmmakers.
Ellie Charles Artists Award & Scholarship: Each
year, African Voices presents the Ellie Charles Artists Awards to honor
artists, community activists and other educators for their contributions to
society.
 
Why should I support African
Voices?
It is one of the few
independent publications dedicated to ensuring that Americaâ€™s literary
tradition remains rich and vibrant.
African Voices could not
publish the magazine without you! African Voices has always been fueled by your
stories, financial contributions and energy.
Every dollar of your
contribution will help us meet our goals in publishing a quality magazine. You
will see the fruits of your contribution if you donate $40 or more â€” you will
receive all four issues of the 20th Anniversary collection.
We are also offering several
cool incentives for you to enjoy as a thank you for your support.

<h3>Where I'm going and Why</h3>
<p>My name is Alexandria Johnson. I recently finished my first professional year of pharmacy school at the Wegmans School of Pharmacy at St. John Fisher College. I’ve become an active member of Christian Pharmacists Fellowship International (CPFI for short). Through this organization I’ve been able to fellowship and network with other pharmacy students and current pharmacists. We also are fervent in creating new and different ways to bring Jesus’ love to the community, nation, and world at large through our influence in the health field. Through this organization and Global Health Outreach, this summer I have the opportunity to travel to El Salvador in Central America!</p>
<p>From July 21<sup>st</sup> through July 29<sup>th</sup>, I will be working alongside about fifty other team members and a local church of San Salvador to set up a medical clinic in order to provide free health care services to thousands of civilians, whom would otherwise have no access. Physicians, dentists, optometrists, pharmacists, as well as medical, pharmacy, and nursing students will set up stations within the clinic. Patients will go through each station and receive eye glasses, tooth extractions, diagnosis for diseases or infections, and then receive any medications that pertain to their health needs. Most importantly the final stations are for prayer and Godly counseling.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I’m working to raise around a total of $2000.00, which will include costs for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel</li>
<li>Vaccinations</li>
<li>Medical Supplies</li>
<li>Meals</li>
<li>Housing</li>
</ul>
<div>In partnering with me, you will be able to have a hand in reaching the world at large. So often we take our every day blessings for granted. This is a unique opportunity to bless others in a country that is largely overlooked.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only will these people be receiving routine medical examinations and prescriptions, there is a large faith aspect involved. As mentioned above, the most important station is the final one, which is for prayer and Godly counseling. This will give me an opportunity to plant the seed of God's word and encourage the people of El Salvador in hope and love!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Above all, I’m asking for your prayers from now until after the trip.  Please pray for the safety of our team and that our trip will be extremely fruitful and eye-opening experience.  I’m so excited to be able to be a blessing through both my medical knowledge and my faith!</p>

<p>   Being raised in a liberal Massachusetts town, we grew up with an emphasis on boasting our free and open minded views. It took a destitute Times Square to reveal that I was not liberal at all. I was a puritanical poster boy. A cold hearted manikin selling pious liberal clothes.<br/><br/>   This book follows a young man who's shell gets cracked into reality. He discovers humility, irony and the splinters of a community that were still deep within the culture of Hell's Kitchen during the eighties. Partly autobiographic and partly fictional.</p>
<p>   Much like the rest of the New York, Times Square has become a tourist haven. The ""I love NY"" t-shirt is the anthem and a transformation that never stops. Big box atores and major chains hide the ghosts of a decimated land. A land imploding on itself.</p>
<p>   This book is a simple series of memories. It's about celebrateing the last survivors of a truly lost neighborhood. Because Times Square was about the people, not just the sex industry.</p>
<p>   Three thousand dollars will be used to research, obtain copyright permissions from period photographs. The funds will also pay for a professional copy editor. Part of the money will be used toward publishing a limited run of paperbacks.</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Sophia and I am an educator, artist and activist in California dedicated to using literacy and the arts for both social change and healing. </p>
<p>For the past year I have crossed the border to Tijuana weekly to volunteer with <b>Dreamers Moms Intl. - Tijuana</b>, a self-organized group of moms and dads who have been deported from the U.S. and are fighting to be reunified with their loved ones. These parents endeavored to write their stories as children's books as a way to explain to their kids the circumstances of their separation and to show their enduring love. The goal is for the books to not serve only as gifts for the kids, but also as artifacts that document and share the marginalized stories of family separation.</p>
<p>We have created seven individual, illustrated children's books that we now hope to share with the public!</p>

Our original post:
Hi everyone!
My name is Sophia and I am an educator, artist and activist in California dedicated to using literacy and the arts for both social change and healing. 
For the past year I have crossed the border to Tijuana weekly to volunteer with Dreamers Moms Intl. - Tijuana, a self-organized group of moms and dads who have been deported from the U.S. and are fighting to be reunified with their loved ones. These parents endeavored to write their stories as children's books as a way to explain to their kids the circumstances of their separation and to show their enduring love.

We have created seven individual, illustrated children's books that we now hope to share with the public!


   What We Have & What We Need  
WE HAVE seven children's books written by seven dedicated parents. We also have beautiful illustrations made by bilingual children of the Sherman Heights Community Center summer camp. All the work done thus far has been volunteer work.

WE HAVE RAISED $2,000 to publish five color, hardcover copies of each of the ten children's books. These have been self-published through Blurb. Why 5 copies? Copies will go to: the children, the parents, DreamersMoms/Border Angels archive, project lead's archive (that's me), and a lending library from which we can lend to schools, non-profits, etc.   $35-40/hardcover book x 10 books x 5 copies = $2000  


BEYOND! We are confident that with your help we will reach our goal. If we surpass our goal we will expand our lending library and lend books to organizations working with separated families and/or we will create an online digital archive of the stories to make them accessible to more people. We have so many additional ideas for this project!




                                   
Why Contribute?  The impact of your contribution is real and immediate:


Children received the cuentos (bedtime stories) as Christmas gifts from their parents, who they are unable to hug or, in most cases, see in person.
Through the cuentos, children who were very young when their parents were deported have an accessible and non-threatening way of understanding what happened to their families.
Parent-authors have experienced the joy of seeing their hard work come to life, hopefully fueling their ánimo and resilience as they fight to reunite with their kids. 
You will help us educate the voting public on the important humanitarian issue of family separation via deportation.

Underhill.  Just about exactly one year
ago he started out into the unknown.  The
previous year he had left his job and gave up trying to pay off his condo to
come to California to seek his rebirth. After spending time exploring different
avenues he started doing what some part of him always knew he needed to:
writing novels.  He had crafted his art
at UC Berkeley in English and Medieval Studies Classes and at a Masters Program
in Medieval Studies in England, but practical realities had until recently
prevented doing what he knew he had to. </p>
<p>Over the past year he has written nearly non-stop. His first
novel (Odyssey to Illith) parallels his own journey, equal parts inner and
external undertakings. His main character begins by following his intuition and
slowly learns, works, and ultimately charges ahead in his fight against evil. In
his second novel (Rakker of Rotwood) his main character is nearly killed during
his training to become a timeless warrior. While he is near death, he tries to
distinguish reality from delusion as he moves between the human realm and the
spirit realm, and realizes the evil he is fighting is not limited to apparent
reality.  The third novel (Ghosts of Mangelwood
Mire) takes place at the climax of the war. Now a full-fledged warrior, he discovers
his own principles while coming into his own as a leader in the context of a
structured order of warriors. </p>
<p>His fourth book (The Undead Witch of Arax) is an adventure in
an entirely different universe. You'll have to check that one out on your own
:).</p>
<p>I'm starting this campaign because as inspiring as his work
is it has yet to make him much money and has reached the point where he needs
to find ways to make ends meet. Luckily, his life is one of an ascetic, and
doesn't need much: groceries, gas, car insurance/maintenance, and rent.  Personally, I think the universe would be a
lot better off were we (the universe) able to provide him with the support to
be able to continue writing and getting his stories to the world. </p>
<p>Anything you can offer would be tremendously
appreciated and would help support wonderful, powerful stories to emerge. I'm setting the goal at $5000, which is
probably about his expenses for a year. To me the return on this investment is
massive, but I greatly encourage you to see for yourself. </p>
<p>For a taste of his work, this is a brief dialogue that he
wrote which gets to the core of the philosophy running through his books: <a href=""https://alexunderhill211.wordpress.com/the-man-who-wrestles-with-dragons/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://alexunderhill211.wordpress.com/the-man-...</a></p>

</p>
<p>Also, even if you can't offer any money, it would still be a tremendous help to follow his blog, read the ebooks (currently on Amazon for $0.99 to $2.99), rate them, or share this campaign on social media. The most important thing is to spread his passion. Reading and enjoying would be the ultimate compliment.  </p><p>With so much gratitude, </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Ninakupenda Gaillard (also known as Nina) and I'm excited to share this project with you that has been years in the making. I created the original concept of this story when I was in high school with a friend in my environmental studies class. It wasn't until I attended Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) for a Bachelors Degree in Sequential Art, that I was able to fully develop this story and turn it into an actual children's book. I always liked the idea of combining fantasy and educational elements in a children's book as a way to help kids enjoy learning; <i>Talia and the Droplets</i> was my way of doing that.</p>
<p><i>Talia and the Droplets</i>, at it's core, covers the story of a girl learning about the water cycle. But it's also about a girl adventuring away from home for the first time and making friends along the way. Kids ages 6 and up can relate to Talia, especially ones that are an only child, like me. Kids younger can also enjoy the story and it can help them easily understand the water cycle at a young age.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because I've always dreamed of putting a physical book out there with my own story and artwork that I can be proud of as an artist. I spent months working out the details for this campaign and worked through a lot of anxiety in order to finally launch this. Having this project succeed would be a great achievement for me as well as artists like me. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've already invested in forming my own company so I can self publish this book, but I still need financial help in order to print the books through a printing company. In order for me to pay for the physical creation of <i>Talia and the Droplets</i>, along with all the perks and other fees, I made a budget of $1,712 to get everything done. For printing the books, I plan to use a site called Print Ninja to make 250 paperback books (which is their minimum) with 32 pages in each. Since I'll be offering free shipping when you buy a book through the campaign, I plan to use any contributions towards shipping fees as well as packaging products. I also will use the money towards making the perks (prints and stickers) as well as Indiegogo's fee and advertising on social media. Below is a chart showing how I plan to split up the money I receive from this campaign based on prior research I did.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537443766/tzj0yaeo8lairuhtsif3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By funding my campaign you can not only get a physical, paperback copy of the book, but also other perks along with it. Some of these perks include a bookmark, small and large prints, stickers, and even personal art commissions created by me!</p>
<p>Because I decided to do a flexible goal, even if I don't reach the full amount, I still can use whatever money I make towards finding a company that can print a smaller amount of books for the people who did buy them through the campaign. I also would still fulfill any perks that were bought at any level. No matter what, I definitely will find a way to get this book printed and delivered to those who bought it.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've been wanting to share this book with the world for almost a year now, but I kept putting in on the back burner due to stress, anxiety, and working on other freelance projects. I really wanted to get this book out sooner but no matter how much I tried, it never felt good enough to me to publish. I had to come to the realization that my desire to get physical copies of this book made was stronger than my fears that it wouldn't be perfect by my standards. Because it's not about it being a perfect book, it's about kids enjoying it. It's about them seeing the art and laughing at some of the silly faces I drew. It's about them finding delight in the story along with the educational lessons hidden in there until the end. At the end of the day, I just want to make art and stories that make people happy and for anyone who buys this book, I want them to feel all the joy and love that I put into this project to make it a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main hurdle when it comes to making a book is getting the illustrations done. Luckily, I'm both the artist and writer of this book and all of the main artwork has been taken care of. While the campaign is going on, I'll finish making the prints and stickers that will be perks so those will be done before the campaign ends. Another hurdle could be printing delays since it's an overseas company. At most it takes 8-10 weeks to have the books printed and then shipped to me. I will post updates on this campaign when there are any developments. I'm rather resourceful. So if some reason the printing company I chose can't complete the order, I have other options I'm considering in order to print books for those that paid for them. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute, thank you for taking the time to read my campaign! It would mean a lot to me if you could share it with your friends, family, or even your local elementary schools. You can use the tools here on Indiegogo to share this project on any social media of your choosing. It only takes a few seconds and any help would be much appreciated.</p>

My second book, scheduled for
TrineDay’s Fall 2015 catalogue, is tentatively titled, <i>Coup: The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing Plot. Coup </i>draws from my

</div> <div> <h3>About The Book Projects <br/>
</h3>
<p>In Spring 2015, TrineDay will release my first book <i>Aberration In The Heartland Of The Real: The
Secret Lives of Timothy McVeigh.</i> <i>Aberration</i>
draws from a wealth of never-before-seen archives and new material from human
sources, and offers a unique reexamination of convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh,
executed in 2001. </p>
<p>Forget everything you thought you knew about America’s
“Face of Domestic Terrorism.” The book asks: <i>Who Was Timothy McVeigh, Really?</i> I offer startling new
biographical details about McVeigh and exposes stark contradictions and errors
contained in previous depictions of the All-American Terrorist. <i>Aberration</i> traces McVeigh’s life from
childhood to the Army, throughout the plot to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building and the period after his 1995 arrest until his 2001 execution. The archival  and oral sources introduced in my books will contribute a
wealth of contextual detail and new information relevant to several sociocultural and political arenas and
will aggressively intercede in debates about the factual details of McVeigh’s life
and the bombing.<br/></p>
<p>McVeigh’s
life, as I describe it, offers a backdrop for her discussion of not
only several intimate and previously unknown details about him, but a number of
episodes and circumstances in American History as well, including: Cold War
popular culture, all-American apocalyptic fervor, organized racism, contentious
politics, militarism, warfare, conspiracy theories and cultures of conspiracy
theorists, bioethical controversies, mind control, the media’s construction of
villains and demons and institutional secrecy and cover-ups.  </p>
<p>Painting’s
next book, tentatively titled, <i>Coup:
The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing Plot  </i>draws
from her previous and ongoing research as well as significant archival material
generously donated by investigative journalist, Cheri Seymour.(For more on Seymour’s archives, see
her bio below.)</p>
<p>While <i>Aberration</i>
focuses on Timothy McVeigh specifically, <i>Coup</i>
will bring to light critical but never-before-exposed information about the
1995 Oklahoma City bombing plot, trace the labyrinthine forces at work around
it, and detail the lives of several characters embedded (through choice or
fate) within it, telling the story of the brave efforts of private citizens and
journalists who attempted to investigate and expose critical details of the plot.
</p>
<p>With your help, I will significantly expand upon
these and other aspects of the bombing plot, expose to the public some of her
most explosive findings to date, and flesh out an in-depth account of the
conspiracy to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. <i>Coup</i> asks the question: <i>Exactly
who fooled whom when the Ryder truck exploded outside of the federal building
in Oklahoma City? </i></p>
<h3>Use of Funds Generated &amp; Project Timeline </h3>
<p>While a new job has allowed me to
 reduce my targeted goal to $15,000, Indiegogo does  allow changes to the stated goal. Even a 
contribution of $10 will go along way. Your contribution will facilitate critical research
 and the writing of a second book (see descriptions below). Contribute
 directly  or
 help me find support by sharing the link to this campaign.</p>
<p>In early September 2014, I will travel to California to meet with Cheri Seymour in California to pick up and review her archival research material. At this time I will begin locating and interviewing long silent individuals, and will continue to do so throughout June 2015. This will require travel funds to speak with people in Utah, California, Arizona, Nevada and other locations. <br/></p>
<p><i>Aberration</i> <i>In The Heartland Of The Real: The Secret
Lives of Timothy McVeigh is </i>complete and the manuscript is currently in the
editing process. Minor changes may be required to the manuscript based upon
Cheri Seymour’s archives and investigative material. Research and writing for <i>Coup: The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing Plot </i>will
 occur from August 2014 to August 2015,
but requires initial and follow-up research, the ability to take time off of work to do the research and writing and editorial assistance. <br/></p>
<p>I will maintain a publicly accessible blog throughout the research 
and writing process so that contributors and interested parties can keep
 track of my  progress. <br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>About Cheri Seymour <br/>
</h3>
<p>Cheri Seymour has
worked as an investigative reporter, newspaper editor, and private detective
for two decades while pursuing a career as a non-fiction writer. Her real-life
exploration through the criminal labyrinth of the “Octopus,” the endemic
corruption in our government and society, and the theft of the PROMIS software
is reflected in various writings for newspapers and magazines. Beyond <a href=""http://www.trineday.com/paypal_store/product_pages/Last_Circle/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">her book on the subject</a>, these include “The Ghost of Danny Casolaro” in <i>High Times</i> magazine in August 2001. Most
of these writings expose organized criminal elements and their symbiotic
relationship with members of the U.S. government.</p>

native Californian born in Los Angeles, Seymour was introduced to writing by
her father, Professor Raynolds Johnson, B.A., Los Angeles State University;
M.A. in English Literature at Stanford University, member of the Greater Los
Angeles Press Club, Sigma Delta Chi, Phi Delta Kappa. </p>
<p>Seymour’s
investigative reporting ultimately led her into the field of security requiring
professional training in counter-terrorism. One assignment included armed
bodyguard service for a lawyer who was representing some former sheriff’s
deputies and grand jurors who had filed the largest civil-rights lawsuit in
California history on November 20, 1987, and a Writ of Mandamus on February 10,
1988 against the director of the Fresno FBI, the California Attorney General
and the Governor of California for refusing to investigate corruption in
Mariposa County. In effect, this launched Seymour’s probe of the “Octopus,”
which finally led her to the hallowed halls of the United States Department of
Justice in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>Seymour ultimately moved to San Diego County where
she went to work in security for defense contractors requiring DOD
security clearances, and as security site supervisor of four Intel Corporation
research and development facilities in Southern California. </p>
<p>Immediately
after the 1995 bombing in Oklahoma City, Seymour was hired as a private
investigator to conduct her own investigation of the bombing. The scope of her
investigation was wide and, during it, Seymour came into contact with and
interviewed some of the most notorious actors among the right wing at that
time, including many who would later become implicated in the bombing plot.In the course of her fearless
investigation, Seymour generated a wealth of explosive and
never-before-published materials, which she has donated to Painting for the
purposes of writing <i>Coup: The 1995
Oklahoma City Bombing Plot.</i></p>
<p>Seymour’s
investigative archives total approximately 10 boxes of materials consisting of
(but not limited to): internal correspondence with and between nationally known
investigative journalists concerning their early investigations into the
bombing plot and their attendance at McVeigh’s 1998 trial; correspondence with
investigators from McVeigh’s legal team; correspondence with other private
investigators working on the case; correspondence with federal agents who
investigated the bombing; internal paperwork originating from various well
known militia groups and white supremacist organizations; and audio and video
interviews with key characters connected to (and some implicated in) the plot;
and never-before-published photographs of the aforementioned characters. </p>

</p>
<p>TrineDay was formed in 2002, when Kris Millegan’s friend Antony
Sutton informed Kris that his book, <i>America’s
Secret Establishment</i> was going out of print. Kris then borrowed $5,000 and
founded TrineDay. Antony was very excited about the new book, and was
scheduling interviews for the book’s release in two months, when he suddenly
died at home, collapsed in his kitchen. TrineDay was left with a book, and no
author to promote it. TrineDay then submitted the book in a cover design
contest and won a national distribution contract with the Independent Publishing
Group in Chicago.</p>
<p><span>  TrineDay’s second
book <i>Expendable Elite </i>by retired Lt. Col. Dan Marvin was targeted by
the Special Forces Association. Kris was told directly that Americans were not
supposed to know how their wars were fought, and that Special Forces personnel
were not supposed to talk about their experiences. A lawsuit for libel was
brought against Lt. Col. Marvin and TrineDay. They were offered a settlement
requiring that TrineDay and Marvin declare the book fiction. They then defended
themselves in Federal District Court in Charleston, SC, and won a unanimous
verdict from the jury. </span></p>
<p><span>  Authors soon
began sending very well-researched and well-written manuscripts that were being
actively suppressed. Nobody was publishing these works. <a href=""http://trineday.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TrineDay</a> has made a mission of bringing these

<p><span>  Kris Millegan’s

warfare against our body politic. Kris didn’t understand, but it started him
following the spoor of secrets, trying to comprehend how the world actually works.
</span></p>
<p><span>  One day in the
early ’70s, Kris told some friends some of the things his Dad had told him, and
one of them looked at him and told him that he was a “conspiracy theorist.”
Kris scratched his head, and said, “What’s that?” And he soon took on conspiracy
theory as an intellectual discipline, beginning a journey, the journey that
begins once you have been confronted with a different but plausible
“world-view.” A person can simply dismiss it all as the ravings of lunatics and
mentally-challenged individuals, or you can look at the body of works and make

that blame it all on the Mormons, the Jesuits, the Jews, the Catholics, the
hippies, the secular humanists, the homosexuals, secret societies, aliens, etc.
Most of these books are mis/disinformation, but if you look at them, check

</div></div>","Short Summary
I am seeking funding to conduct research for a second book. My first book, Aberration In The Heartland Of The Real: The Secret Lives of Timothy McVeigh will appear from TrineDay in the Spring of 2015. My second book, scheduled for
TrineDay’s Fall 2015 catalogue, is tentatively titled, Coup: The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing Plot. Coup draws from my
previous and ongoing research as well as seminal research conducted by
investigative journalist Cheri Seymour, author of Committee Of The States: Inside The Radical Right (Camden Place
Communications Inc., 1991) and The Last Circle: Danny Casolaro’s Investigation into the Octopus and the Promis Software Scandal (TrineDay, 2010).

While I have been able to
 reduce my targeted goal to $15,000, Indiegogo does not allow changes to the originally stated goal. Even a 
contribution of $10 will go along way. Your contribution will facilitate critical research
 and the writing of my second book  (see information about both books below). Contribute
 directly  or
 help by sharing the link to this campaign.
  About The Book Projects 

In Spring 2015, TrineDay will release my first book Aberration In The Heartland Of The Real: The
Secret Lives of Timothy McVeigh. Aberration
draws from a wealth of never-before-seen archives and new material from human
sources, and offers a unique reexamination of convicted bomber Timothy McVeigh,
executed in 2001. 
Forget everything you thought you knew about America’s
“Face of Domestic Terrorism.” The book asks: Who Was Timothy McVeigh, Really? I offer startling new
biographical details about McVeigh and exposes stark contradictions and errors
contained in previous depictions of the All-American Terrorist. Aberration traces McVeigh’s life from
childhood to the Army, throughout the plot to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building and the period after his 1995 arrest until his 2001 execution. The archival  and oral sources introduced in my books will contribute a
wealth of contextual detail and new information relevant to several sociocultural and political arenas and
will aggressively intercede in debates about the factual details of McVeigh’s life
and the bombing.
McVeigh’s
life, as I describe it, offers a backdrop for her discussion of not
only several intimate and previously unknown details about him, but a number of
episodes and circumstances in American History as well, including: Cold War
popular culture, all-American apocalyptic fervor, organized racism, contentious
politics, militarism, warfare, conspiracy theories and cultures of conspiracy
theorists, bioethical controversies, mind control, the media’s construction of
villains and demons and institutional secrecy and cover-ups.  
Painting’s
next book, tentatively titled, Coup:
The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing Plot  draws
from her previous and ongoing research as well as significant archival material
generously donated by investigative journalist, Cheri Seymour.(For more on Seymour’s archives, see
her bio below.)
While Aberration
focuses on Timothy McVeigh specifically, Coup
will bring to light critical but never-before-exposed information about the
1995 Oklahoma City bombing plot, trace the labyrinthine forces at work around
it, and detail the lives of several characters embedded (through choice or
fate) within it, telling the story of the brave efforts of private citizens and
journalists who attempted to investigate and expose critical details of the plot.

With your help, I will significantly expand upon
these and other aspects of the bombing plot, expose to the public some of her
most explosive findings to date, and flesh out an in-depth account of the
conspiracy to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Coup asks the question: Exactly
who fooled whom when the Ryder truck exploded outside of the federal building
in Oklahoma City? 
Use of Funds Generated & Project Timeline 
While a new job has allowed me to
 reduce my targeted goal to $15,000, Indiegogo does  allow changes to the stated goal. Even a 
contribution of $10 will go along way. Your contribution will facilitate critical research
 and the writing of a second book (see descriptions below). Contribute
 directly  or
 help me find support by sharing the link to this campaign.
In early September 2014, I will travel to California to meet with Cheri Seymour in California to pick up and review her archival research material. At this time I will begin locating and interviewing long silent individuals, and will continue to do so throughout June 2015. This will require travel funds to speak with people in Utah, California, Arizona, Nevada and other locations. 
Aberration In The Heartland Of The Real: The Secret
Lives of Timothy McVeigh is complete and the manuscript is currently in the
editing process. Minor changes may be required to the manuscript based upon
Cheri Seymour’s archives and investigative material. Research and writing for Coup: The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing Plot will
 occur from August 2014 to August 2015,
but requires initial and follow-up research, the ability to take time off of work to do the research and writing and editorial assistance. 
I will maintain a publicly accessible blog throughout the research 
and writing process so that contributors and interested parties can keep
 track of my  progress. 
  About Wendy S. Painting, PhD
Wendy Painting holds a PhD in American Studies from the University of Buffalo. Painting's extensive and
seminal investigatory research into the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and Timothy
McVeigh distinguishes her as a leading national expert on both subjects. Her
research has been credited in other books including Roger Charles’ 2012
publication Oklahoma City: What The Investigation Missed and Why It Matters. Dr.
Painting co-authored and co-produced the 2011 documentary film, A Noble Lie: Oklahoma City 1995. 
Her research has  included unparalleled access to publicly
and privately held archives as well as countless interviews and
correspondence with individuals throughout the United States, including bombing
victims’ family members, survivors, witnesses, attorneys, private
investigators, journalists, McVeigh’s coworkers, friends, neighbors and
underworld associates: bank robbers, neo-Nazis, militia leaders and many
others. 
Painting
has presented her analysis about McVeigh and the bombing throughout the country
at a number of academic conferences, including annual meetings of the Oral History
Association,
Popular Culture /
American Culture Association and the American Folklore Society, as well as at popular
venues such as Brave New Books in Austin, Texas. Dr. Painting has designed and taught a
variety of English, History and American Studies courses in the Rochester area.
Courses taught include (but are not limited to): Surveillance in Society,
Introduction to U.S. History, The Cold War, Crime and Criminals in History,
Folklore and Legend, U.S. Prison Systems, Cultural History, Ethnographies and
Oral Histories in World Civilizations and College Composition. She has also
lectured at other area colleges on McVeigh and other topics, including
""The Institutional Repression of AIM: The American Indian Movement.""
Painting
currently works as an investigative researcher in Western Upstate New York.

  About Cheri Seymour 

Cheri Seymour has
worked as an investigative reporter, newspaper editor, and private detective
for two decades while pursuing a career as a non-fiction writer. Her real-life
exploration through the criminal labyrinth of the “Octopus,” the endemic
corruption in our government and society, and the theft of the PROMIS software
is reflected in various writings for newspapers and magazines. Beyond her book on the subject, these include “The Ghost of Danny Casolaro” in High Times magazine in August 2001. Most
of these writings expose organized criminal elements and their symbiotic
relationship with members of the U.S. government.
A
native Californian born in Los Angeles, Seymour was introduced to writing by
her father, Professor Raynolds Johnson, B.A., Los Angeles State University;
M.A. in English Literature at Stanford University, member of the Greater Los
Angeles Press Club, Sigma Delta Chi, Phi Delta Kappa. 
Seymour’s

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hey,</p>
<p><span>My name is Erin Drello.  I am a writer, a chef, a student, a son, a brother, an uncle, a music lover, a philanthropist, and a glutton in recovery.  I have lived most of my life in the great southern state of Georgia, with a very short stint in Tennessee. I was a chef on Grand Cayman Island and ended up completely over serving myself in more ways than one in beautiful Colorado.  Realizing my life was empty and needed a change, I turned to my southern heritage for a place of healing and growth.  In the last eighteen months I have worked on improving my health, my spirituality, my family life, my friendships, and my responsibilities within my community.  I am  headed back to school to pursue a life long dream of becoming a professional writer.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Need &amp; What Get</h3>
<p>I have written about my pain, my growth, my loss, my happiness and evverything inbetween over the last eightteen months.  These writings are a fantastic look into what a person goes through in the first year and a half of getting sober and working to stay sober.  With your help and $1000 and some wonderful artwork from a great friend I will be able to accomplish the dream of becoming a published author and share a personal story that I refuse to be ashamed of with the world.</p>
<p>There are different perks for different levels of contributions.  Every dollar helps and your support will be recognized and rewarded..  In a sense!</p>
<p>Since I have been sharing some of my story with the world I have received a great bit correspondence from complete strangers who have read some of my work and shared their experience, strength, or hope with me and that is amazing to me. I would like to continue to try and touch people in their time of struggle with drugs and alcohol, and maybe, I can help save one life.  With your help we can show the world that if I can do it anyone can get the help they need.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot donate here, there are many ways you can help.  Compassion, love, and tolerance is the first place you can help.  Addiction is not a MORAL issue it is a real disease that is fatal.  Addiction touches every single family in one way or another, so think about what if that was my brother, son, uncle, father.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After walking around the streets of the Capital City of Canada, Ottawa Ontario, I was shocked by the amount of people that live on the streets and require the shelters to keep warm in the cold winters.  This book will be a chance for these people to have their story told.  How did they get there, how do they live day to day.  </p>
<p>I am a photographer that has a passion for showing the personality within a subject and believe that everybody has a story to tell.  This will be my opportunity to make this happen.</p>
<h3>
<strong>What We Need &amp;</strong> What<strong> You Get</strong>
</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The money raised in this project will help fund the publishing costs for the book as well as the donations to each of the people that are on the street.  Each person that I interview will be given a gift card for food at local diners for where they are. Places such as Tim Horton's where a hot cup of coffee, soup and sandwich can be purchased.  A percentage of all sales of the book will also be donated to the local shelters.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>People need to know that in these tough economic times that they could be the next person holding a sign on a street corner asking for some change just to feed themselves or their family.  Hearing the stories of these people may be enough to bring this to the forefront of our lives.  These are human beings with feelings and hope.  We cannot turn our backs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you find you cannot contribute to this campaign, I encourage you to spread the word about it.  My goal is to be able to publish books such as this in major cities across Canada and everywhere that homelessness is a major issue.  As we all know, that ultimately is everywhere.</p>

<h3>Help us fund our magazine’s third issue!</h3>
<p>We are a group of young ‘cultural volunteers’, who in 2010 formed the team ‘Kourdista Mandarinia’ (<a href=""http://www.kourdistamandarinia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kourdistamandarinia.com</a>) and initiated the publication of an arts &amp; culture magazine called EL.VO. (Ελευθέρας Βοσκής). Below you can find more information about this magazine and the last two issues, which you can also view on our website for free!</p>
<p><strong>So, why do we need your help for the 3rd issue?</strong></p>
<p>Though we had have a lot of enthusiastic readers and have received a lot of positive feedback for our first two issues, financial support for the magazine’s continuation is scarce, partly because of the reluctance to support new and small-scale initiatives and partly because of the general economic crisis that we all experience these days. Our estimated funds (from ads) can cover the expenses for the design of the magazine but they are not sufficient for its printing, and if it doesn’t appear in print form as well as online, we won’t be able to include ads...</p>
<p>Thus, we urge all of you to help us proceed with the new issue by contributing even the smallest amount (5 US dollars) so that, through a collective effort, we collect the necessary funds for printing our magazine.</p>
<p><strong>Also...</strong></p>
<p>Issue 3 is scheduled to come out in December/early January. Apart from financial support, we also welcome writers and artists to contribute their work for the magazine. Find our Call for Contributions under the Gallery tab above.</p>

<p>I would like to take a moment to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for donating to my campaign thus far. Words are not enough to define how much I appreciate each of you! This has been a great learning experience for me to date and, without your support and belief in me, the Rhythms and Words contained in “Rhythmic Words, Vol. I” would still be stowed securely away in my numerous journals. As of today, however, we still have a long way to go in getting this book marketed to the world. To make this happen, I am sending out a personal plea to anyone, with a little to spare, to please contribute monetarily what you can to help us market this amazing collection. Donations can be as little as $1.00!! I firmly believe there is a poem written for anyone to connect with, for anyone to feel, to enjoy, to inspire, or to personally touch your soul.</p>

<p>My campaign is about garnering support for my first book <strong>Rhythmic Words</strong> due to be released on <strong>July 29, 2012.</strong></p>
<p>I have been beset with a host of physical ailments primarily debilitating migraine headaches since the age of 14. For the last 24 years, I have battled with these headaches which have caused a host of life challenges for me. Through all the chronic pain, the one thing that never wavered was my desire to write and learning to perfect my craft.</p>
<p>In 1993, I asked my mother a very simple question, ""how do you write?"" Upon receiving an answer to this question, I penned my first poem that night and have penned over 1,000 poems since.</p>
<p>Rhythmic Words is my literary introduction to the world. The poems in the book span over different times in my life -- some good, some bad, and everything in between.  In a nutshell, there is a poem in the book written for everyone, from every walk of life, to connect with.</p>
<p>I am seeking assistance with the marketing of the book to a nationwide and eventually, a worldwide audience. I am also seeking financial assistance with having the book published and distributed via an ebook format on Kindle, Nook, iBookstore, and all the major electronic formats. I believe this book will touch thousands of lives but, I need your assistance to help make this a reality!  </p>
<p>Rhythmic Words is my first installment. I am currently working on finalizing my second manuscript for Volume II which I hope to independently publish in the Fall of 2013.</p>
<p>Any monetary amount will help. However, I understand that these are tough economic times for many, myself included.  As such, if you are unable contribute financially, please mention the book, and the release date of the book to others or click the share via Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ icons located right above this section.</p>

In 1993, I asked my mother a very simple question, ""how do you write?"" Upon receiving an answer to this question, I penned my first poem that night and have penned over 1,000 poems since.
Rhythmic Words is my literary introduction to the world. The poems in the book span over different times in my life -- some good, some bad, and everything in between.  In a nutshell, there is a poem in the book written for everyone, from every walk of life, to connect with.
I am seeking assistance with the marketing of the book to a nationwide and eventually, a worldwide audience. I am also seeking financial assistance with having the book published and distributed via an ebook format on Kindle, Nook, iBookstore, and all the major electronic formats. I believe this book will touch thousands of lives but, I need your assistance to help make this a reality!  
Rhythmic Words is my first installment. I am currently working on finalizing my second manuscript for Volume II which I hope to independently publish in the Fall of 2013.
Any monetary amount will help. However, I understand that these are tough economic times for many, myself included.  As such, if you are unable contribute financially, please mention the book, and the release date of the book to others or click the share via Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ icons located right above this section.
You can also follow me on Twitter at http://twitter.com/obskurewriter and on Facebook at http://facebook.com/obskurewriter for updates as the release date approaches.  
I thank you in advance!

Simply put, he's a bit of a miracle. The question he's asked himself time over is this, ""How does an abused, runaway kid, who lived homeless on the streets of London, end up touring the world, performing for HRH Queen Elizabeth II, for US presidential events, become a master Didgeridoo player and an adopted son to some of the world's most beautiful tribes people?""</p><p><b>Well, </b>it's time for him to answer the question and to tell the tale by writing his book, one that will inspire, not only other survivors of abuse, but people the world over. His story truly is exceptional. Bear says, ""As a survivor of child abuse I have experienced feelings of worthlessness and had those feelings used against me by sexual predators who slowly destroyed my sense of self worth. I was psychologically manipulated into defining myself as an instrument for their depraved actions. However, the time has come for me to fully reclaim my heart, mind, body and soul from the abuse. By supporting me with this project, you will be offering me that chance, and I thank you so very much for it.""</p><b>*As well as the true story, this unique book will also contain</b> a section dedicated to healing and the transformational arc of ones life's path through the power of tribal wisdom.<p><b>News Flash!!!

<h2><b>                The Story Outline</b></h2><p><b>Raised in an abusive home </b>environment by alcoholic parents, Chris was to beat the odds and rise above to become a truly
remarkable man. <br/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Throughout his childhood,</b> Chris felt a
deep connection to nature and tribal cultures. “The initiations onto my life
path began at an early age.  As a boy, wild
birds fascinated me;
they offered me a beautiful distraction from the ongoing issues at home.  I began collecting their feathers, a
tradition practiced by many native cultures. As a young
child, I had vivid, reoccurring dreams of a group of native elders who would ask me many questions about who I was, why I was here and if I remembered? The suffering I endured throughout my childhood, and
early adult life, was in it’s own way a very real ‘rites of passage’, necessary
amongst many of the world’s tribes people, and played a vital part in creating my own life path.” </p><p><b>Chris was sexually abused</b> as a child and as a side effect of this, his behaviour towards adults began to change.  When an adult approached him he would begin to growl as a defence, like a little wild animal would. Consequently, he was sent away to a boarding school for troubled kids at aged 10. The “school”
environment was supposed to be a safe and supportive one, but turned out to be
quite the opposite. Chris was to experience yet more abuse (physical, sexual
and mental) until finally the warrior inside him woke up. Taking his life into
his own hands at age 15, he ran away, or as Chris puts it, “escaped”.  He then found himself sleeping on the streets of London. <br/></p>
<p><b>As a means of survival</b>, Chris was
forced into a very dangerous world. However, his love
of nature and early childhood calling from “Spirit” kept returning to his
heart.</p>
<p><b>Chris pulled himself </b>from this nightmare
existence after being guided to a wonderful therapist who helped him understand and connect with the accountability necessary for him to heal and move on with his life. After being introduced to contacts in the entertainment industry, Chris began
working as an agent’s assistant and soon found his own niche in film and TV working as a stuntman,
specializing in horses. Notably, Chris has worked alongside the likes of Ron Howard, Kevin Costner
and Morgan Freeman in big budget feature films, learning from the best in
movies such as, ""Willow"", ""Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves"", ""Batman"" and many more. </p>
<p><b>Although the glamour and excitement</b> of
the movie world was an alluring one, Chris felt that there was still much to
discover about himself. It was at this time that he was drawn back towards his
fascination, or rather, connection, to tribal culture. A new path opened up to
him with the aboriginal people of the northern territories of Arnhem Land,
Australia, and particularly their ancient instrument, the Didgeridoo.  Chris traveled throughout Australia and eventually
found his aboriginal teacher, Blanasi, an elder “law giver” of his
community.  Chris is now one of a handful of
westerners to have truly mastered the instrument. Below is a photo of Bear's teacher and elder ""law giver"" David Blanasi.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/508506/files/20140414163647-7301846.jpg?1397518607"" src="""" style=""width: 565.2077922077923px; height: 445px;""/><b>Cometh the name of Bear,</b> a story in itself, but you'll have to read that one in the book ;)<b> </b>Below is a photo of the ""Sun Lodge"" tipi that Bear built and travelled with throughout Europe, teaching traditional storytelling, healing and ceremony.

and worked with tribal leaders from all over the world. He was invited to
take part in both speaking engagements and ceremonial practices. Bear is now an
adopted son of the Maasai people of Kenya and the Oglala, Lakota people of
South Dakota, USA. Ironically, while working alongside Kevin Costner, in “Robin
Hood, Prince of Thieves”, back in 1990, he was invited by Costner, after forming a friendship with him, to
the world screening premiere of his, then, latest movie, <b>“Dances with Wolves.”</b><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/448499/files/20140320170745-Unknown.jpeg?1395360465"" src="""" style=""width: 544.1726618705036px; height: 305px;""/></p><p></p><p><b>On reflection</b>, Bear knows that
the invitation played a powerful part in him understanding exactly who he is, through his love and respect for the earth and indigenous cultures. It also felt
rather surreal for him to be literally living the role of
Costner’s character, Lieutenant john Dunbar, from the movie, the difference being, Bear's journey is not a
fictional one. </p><p></p><p></p>
<p><b>Bear has spoken</b> internationally as an inspirational speaker, as
a performer and life coach. He has worked alongside some of the world’s top names
in personal development from Bob Proctor (presenter of the movie ‘The Secret’
and NY times bestselling author of ‘You Were Born Rich’), as well as, Mark
Victor Hanson and Jack Canfield (bestselling authors of the highly successful ‘Chicken
Soup for the Soul’ series of books), with presidential advisor, Doug Wead, and
keynote speaker, Dr Richard Bandler, creator of NLP (of which Chris is a master
practitioner) </p><p><b>Because of the depth</b> of his life experience and knowledge, Bear became a life coach and guide to literally hundreds of people seeking healing or transformation in their own lives, Bear says, ""For most of us, there comes a time in our lives when we need independent mentoring and guidance in some form or another. Transformation and change only come about if we actively set to in making those changes into a reality and I feel deeply privileged to have played a part in helping others to create their dreams alive and to heal where they feel they needed to.""</p><p><b>Bear has created</b> music therapy programs for young people faced
with mental and physical challenges, hosted spiritual retreats with the “Youth
at Risk”, program for young people and adults in the USA, and is an inspiration to
survivors of abuse from all walks of life. 
One of Bear's passions is seeing that the rights of children from all
backgrounds are upheld by those in society who have the
capability to do so. </p>
<p><b>Bear's path</b> has taken him through
some of the most challenging experiences that one can endure, however, by
healing and empowering his life, he has created a “Path of Beauty”. Regardless
of his past, Bear has always retained a deep empathy for the needs of others, which is of great importance
to him today. Anyone who has met him will agree, he is one of the few ""magic
makers"" left in the world.  He has inspired and
helped thousands of others and is deeply committed to dedicating his life to
helping many more. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>       Watch out! Bear on the road!</h2><p><b>On publication of the book</b>, ""A Wild Nobility"",  it is Bear's intention to take his story, and gift as a live performer, on tour. Visiting as many towns, cities and communities, the world over, as he can. Bear believes that through his story, others will become inspired to heal and reclaim their own lives, and then in turn, even more people. To say that this kind of healing is a passion of Bear's would be a happy understatement. By pledging to, and supporting this project, you become a special VIP guest of Bear's to any of his, ""Medicine Show"" live performances.</p><p></p><p>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/447726/files/20140320111130-Shining.jpg?1395339090"" src="""" style=""width: 232.90841584158417px; height: 369px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/447731/files/20140320111226-2419_58190355994_5540760_n-1.jpg?1395339146"" src="""" style=""width: 281.21008403361344px; height: 376px;""/></p><h2>            The Secret Connection</h2><p><b>Don't believe in real magic? Well, maybe read on... Here's what Mr. Bob Proctor, keynote presenter of the film, ""The Secret"" and New York Times best selling author has to say:</b></p><p><b></b></p>
<p><b><i>“Chris Brosnan or simply
“Bear”</i></b><i> to his friends and I
am proud to call him my friend, totally shifted my mind and changed my life:
that may well seem exaggerated and if you tried to tell me he could do that
prior to meeting him, I would have seriously doubted you … but he did, and he
did it to me</i>. <i>If you want to totally
capture the attention of the audience and keep them mesmerized… put “Bear” on
your stage. I have been conducting conferences on personal development and
speaking at conventions all over the world for forty years, and I have never
been more impressed by a performance than his… He is truly one of a kind, if
ever you have the opportunity to experience “Bear” and his healings walk if you
have to, but get there. Then like me, ten years later, you will still be
talking about him</i><b><i>.”  </i>Bob

Simply put, he's a bit of a miracle. The question he's asked himself time over is this, ""How does an abused, runaway kid, who lived homeless on the streets of London, end up touring the world, performing for HRH Queen Elizabeth II, for US presidential events, become a master Didgeridoo player and an adopted son to some of the world's most beautiful tribes people?""Well, it's time for him to answer the question and to tell the tale by writing his book, one that will inspire, not only other survivors of abuse, but people the world over. His story truly is exceptional. Bear says, ""As a survivor of child abuse I have experienced feelings of worthlessness and had those feelings used against me by sexual predators who slowly destroyed my sense of self worth. I was psychologically manipulated into defining myself as an instrument for their depraved actions. However, the time has come for me to fully reclaim my heart, mind, body and soul from the abuse. By supporting me with this project, you will be offering me that chance, and I thank you so very much for it.""*As well as the true story, this unique book will also contain a section dedicated to healing and the transformational arc of ones life's path through the power of tribal wisdom.News Flash!!! Bear Live on LA Talk Radio interview about his book, click the link and go to 26 mins into the interview ...http://www.latalkradio.com/archives/Sam-040114.mp3SIX GREAT REASONS TO SUPPORT BEAR'S PUBLISHING DREAM♥  You'll help make a stand for survivors of sexual abuse the world over by lending your voice to an issue that's so important and deserves its place on the global platform, one that shouts, NO TO CHILD ABUSE: It's not funny, it destroys lives and steals the innocence of children the world over. ♥  You'll allow us to produce, edit, scan, post-produce, book design, print, market and deliver the whole package.♥ You'll own a copy of the book you helped publish and maybe your own custom designed Didgeridoo melody, created by Bear, just for you, a total one-off.♥  You'll help fund Bear's tour of the book to communities throughout the world who have been impacted by abuse issues. ♥ You'll perhaps even help a child be able to stand up and say, ""NO"" to an abuser and literally change the course of that young life, forever.♥ You'll be uplifted, inspired and moved in ways beyond the unusual, and we guarantee you this, it's not a sob story, it's an incredible journey of self discovery that could change the way you feel about your own challenges and consciousness.          So, who is this guy Bear?                          
                The Story OutlineRaised in an abusive home environment by alcoholic parents, Chris was to beat the odds and rise above to become a truly
remarkable man. 
Throughout his childhood, Chris felt a
deep connection to nature and tribal cultures. “The initiations onto my life
path began at an early age.  As a boy, wild
birds fascinated me;
they offered me a beautiful distraction from the ongoing issues at home.  I began collecting their feathers, a
tradition practiced by many native cultures. As a young
child, I had vivid, reoccurring dreams of a group of native elders who would ask me many questions about who I was, why I was here and if I remembered? The suffering I endured throughout my childhood, and
early adult life, was in it’s own way a very real ‘rites of passage’, necessary
amongst many of the world’s tribes people, and played a vital part in creating my own life path.” Chris was sexually abused as a child and as a side effect of this, his behaviour towards adults began to change.  When an adult approached him he would begin to growl as a defence, like a little wild animal would. Consequently, he was sent away to a boarding school for troubled kids at aged 10. The “school”
environment was supposed to be a safe and supportive one, but turned out to be
quite the opposite. Chris was to experience yet more abuse (physical, sexual
and mental) until finally the warrior inside him woke up. Taking his life into
his own hands at age 15, he ran away, or as Chris puts it, “escaped”.  He then found himself sleeping on the streets of London. 
As a means of survival, Chris was
forced into a very dangerous world. However, his love
of nature and early childhood calling from “Spirit” kept returning to his
heart.
Chris pulled himself from this nightmare
existence after being guided to a wonderful therapist who helped him understand and connect with the accountability necessary for him to heal and move on with his life. After being introduced to contacts in the entertainment industry, Chris began
working as an agent’s assistant and soon found his own niche in film and TV working as a stuntman,
specializing in horses. Notably, Chris has worked alongside the likes of Ron Howard, Kevin Costner
and Morgan Freeman in big budget feature films, learning from the best in
movies such as, ""Willow"", ""Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves"", ""Batman"" and many more. 
Although the glamour and excitement of
the movie world was an alluring one, Chris felt that there was still much to
discover about himself. It was at this time that he was drawn back towards his
fascination, or rather, connection, to tribal culture. A new path opened up to
him with the aboriginal people of the northern territories of Arnhem Land,
Australia, and particularly their ancient instrument, the Didgeridoo.  Chris traveled throughout Australia and eventually
found his aboriginal teacher, Blanasi, an elder “law giver” of his
community.  Chris is now one of a handful of
westerners to have truly mastered the instrument. Below is a photo of Bear's teacher and elder ""law giver"" David Blanasi.Cometh the name of Bear, a story in itself, but you'll have to read that one in the book ;) Below is a photo of the ""Sun Lodge"" tipi that Bear built and travelled with throughout Europe, teaching traditional storytelling, healing and ceremony. The lodge also acted as a gathering place for people to connect back to the earth with and to their indigenous souls.Bear was invited to the United Nations Indigenous Peoples' working group as an NGO, (Non-Government Official) where he connected, hosted for
and worked with tribal leaders from all over the world. He was invited to
take part in both speaking engagements and ceremonial practices. Bear is now an
adopted son of the Maasai people of Kenya and the Oglala, Lakota people of
South Dakota, USA. Ironically, while working alongside Kevin Costner, in “Robin
Hood, Prince of Thieves”, back in 1990, he was invited by Costner, after forming a friendship with him, to
the world screening premiere of his, then, latest movie, “Dances with Wolves.”    On reflection, Bear knows that
the invitation played a powerful part in him understanding exactly who he is, through his love and respect for the earth and indigenous cultures. It also felt
rather surreal for him to be literally living the role of
Costner’s character, Lieutenant john Dunbar, from the movie, the difference being, Bear's journey is not a
fictional one. 
Bear has spoken internationally as an inspirational speaker, as
a performer and life coach. He has worked alongside some of the world’s top names
in personal development from Bob Proctor (presenter of the movie ‘The Secret’
and NY times bestselling author of ‘You Were Born Rich’), as well as, Mark
Victor Hanson and Jack Canfield (bestselling authors of the highly successful ‘Chicken
Soup for the Soul’ series of books), with presidential advisor, Doug Wead, and
keynote speaker, Dr Richard Bandler, creator of NLP (of which Chris is a master
practitioner) Because of the depth of his life experience and knowledge, Bear became a life coach and guide to literally hundreds of people seeking healing or transformation in their own lives, Bear says, ""For most of us, there comes a time in our lives when we need independent mentoring and guidance in some form or another. Transformation and change only come about if we actively set to in making those changes into a reality and I feel deeply privileged to have played a part in helping others to create their dreams alive and to heal where they feel they needed to.""Bear has created music therapy programs for young people faced
with mental and physical challenges, hosted spiritual retreats with the “Youth
at Risk”, program for young people and adults in the USA, and is an inspiration to
survivors of abuse from all walks of life. 
One of Bear's passions is seeing that the rights of children from all
backgrounds are upheld by those in society who have the
capability to do so. 
Bear's path has taken him through
some of the most challenging experiences that one can endure, however, by
healing and empowering his life, he has created a “Path of Beauty”. Regardless
of his past, Bear has always retained a deep empathy for the needs of others, which is of great importance
to him today. Anyone who has met him will agree, he is one of the few ""magic
makers"" left in the world.  He has inspired and
helped thousands of others and is deeply committed to dedicating his life to
helping many more.        Watch out! Bear on the road!On publication of the book, ""A Wild Nobility"",  it is Bear's intention to take his story, and gift as a live performer, on tour. Visiting as many towns, cities and communities, the world over, as he can. Bear believes that through his story, others will become inspired to heal and reclaim their own lives, and then in turn, even more people. To say that this kind of healing is a passion of Bear's would be a happy understatement. By pledging to, and supporting this project, you become a special VIP guest of Bear's to any of his, ""Medicine Show"" live performances.                      The Secret ConnectionDon't believe in real magic? Well, maybe read on... Here's what Mr. Bob Proctor, keynote presenter of the film, ""The Secret"" and New York Times best selling author has to say:
“Chris Brosnan or simply
“Bear” to his friends and I
am proud to call him my friend, totally shifted my mind and changed my life:
that may well seem exaggerated and if you tried to tell me he could do that
prior to meeting him, I would have seriously doubted you … but he did, and he
did it to me. If you want to totally
capture the attention of the audience and keep them mesmerized… put “Bear” on
your stage. I have been conducting conferences on personal development and
speaking at conventions all over the world for forty years, and I have never
been more impressed by a performance than his… He is truly one of a kind, if
ever you have the opportunity to experience “Bear” and his healings walk if you
have to, but get there. Then like me, ten years later, you will still be
talking about him.”  Bob
Proctor .
The natural progression into writing and producing is something Bear is very focussed on, his passion and energy is on breathing life into this exiting new project. Chris ""Bear"" Brosnan has written for and been featured in ""Sacred Hoop"" and ""Kindred Spirit"" magazine, as well as, the ""London Times"" newspaper where he was described as, ""A Music Maverick Extraordinaire."" Bear's other writings include: ""Fugitive Fathers"", ""Wimps To Warriors"", ""The Shadow Catcher"", ""Healers"", ""Pimp Hunter"", ""Hookers to Heroes"", ""Gospel According to Elvis"", ""The Redemption of Man"" and ""Finn McCool - The Forging of the Fianna"" graphic novel series and the feature film screenplay of the same.http://www.thesoulshaman.comhttp://www.mydreamsleep.comhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/A-Wild-Nobility/661107397281804?ref=hlhttps://www.facebook.com/chris.b.brosnanhttps://twitter.com/CDBrosnan11http://www.d2l.orgIf you are unable to pledge at this time then you can still help by spreading the word about this funding campaign to those around you via Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, emails to friends, contacts and importantly by using the Indiegogo share buttons at the very top of this page ... YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. The above images is of Bear breathing in the sunset on his adopted families land on Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota. You will notice that the campaign is in $s and not GBP that's because Chris lives between Canada and the USA, which is where he will be producing his book. Preparing a book isn't cheap, however, I have done all I possible can to create a realistic budget that doesn't sacrifice quality. The total initial budget is USD $5,000.00 or approx GBP £3,000.00. Estimate of all costs is in US dollars:

Professional Beta Reading
$250.00


Developmental Editing
$820.00


Copy and Photo Editing
$1,160.00


Cover Art/Design (Books are judged bytheir covers, like it or not ;)
$500.00


Promotional/Marketing Budget (This is as wideas it is tall! :) Most good PR cost around $1000 per monthbut can cost up to $5000 depending on budget. I have gone for $1000 as a start up cost.
$1,000.00


Print Formatting & Digital Conversion and ISBN number
$360.00$125.00


Pre Publication Reviews
$320


Payment Processing
$127.00


Indiegogo fees

TOTAL
$5000.00

NOTE: You will notice that I have not added in the actual physical printing costs for the book and this is why. I intend to use what's now called, ""On-demand"" print services, so that as a book is ordered, the book is printed. This is a fantastic way of cutting back on storage and delivery costs. It also means that the book comes, ""Hot off the Press."" This is how your hard copy of the book will be printed for you, if you preorder a hard copy that is, and the price for its pyhsical printing is included in your pledge ;)10% of profits from sales of Bear's book, ""A Wild Nobility"" will go to the ""Darkness to Light - End Child Abuse Charity."" For more info on the charity please click on the d2l link above. ALL other profits raised will go towards Bear's touring expenses and promoting more awareness around the issue of child abuse. This is a non-profit based project. Thank you for your kind support and for taking action, where action is needed. ALL children deserve the right to live free of abuse ... FULL STOP.FAQ:Do we ship worldwide?Yes!

 line between good and evil, reality and imagination, or myth and the 
mundane. I believe performance is a key component of the poetic 
tradition, and that by embracing the seemingly incompatible influences 
of classical fine art, popular culture, and digital media, this tradition may be revitalized.</span></span></span></span></span> That's what makes this project so perfect for me: the Kod Marula is devoted to literary performance, and that's something very close to my heart. I began writing ten years ago, and have worked professionally for the past two. Most recently, I performed some of my work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, during their 2014 21Minus event, and sold one hundred copies of a self-published chapbook called 'Hysteria' (available for purchase here: <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/RanieriPoetry"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.etsy.com/shop/RanieriPoetry</a>). I have also worked in the past as an actor, musician, and artist.</p>
<p>This campaign will be to fund an opportunity for me to work as a poet-in-residence at the 'Zvona i Nari' residency in Ližnjan, Croatia, from May 7th-22nd, 2015. I will be taking part in the 'Kod Marula' festival in Pula during that time, an exciting event which gathers young writers from all around the globe to perform excerpts of their work in Croatian for students and young professionals. This is an exciting career milestone for me, as it will be my first ever residency as a professional poet.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help fund my plane tickets to and from Pula, and transportation costs from Pula to Ližnjan and the surrounding areas.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Alexandra Ranieri, and I am a 19-year-old professional poet. My work focuses on the line between, whether that be the
 line between good and evil, reality and imagination, or myth and the 
mundane. I believe performance is a key component of the poetic 
tradition, and that by embracing the seemingly incompatible influences 
of classical fine art, popular culture, and digital media, this tradition may be revitalized. That's what makes this project so perfect for me: the Kod Marula is devoted to literary performance, and that's something very close to my heart. I began writing ten years ago, and have worked professionally for the past two. Most recently, I performed some of my work at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, during their 2014 21Minus event, and sold one hundred copies of a self-published chapbook called 'Hysteria' (available for purchase here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/RanieriPoetry). I have also worked in the past as an actor, musician, and artist.
This campaign will be to fund an opportunity for me to work as a poet-in-residence at the 'Zvona i Nari' residency in Ližnjan, Croatia, from May 7th-22nd, 2015. I will be taking part in the 'Kod Marula' festival in Pula during that time, an exciting event which gathers young writers from all around the globe to perform excerpts of their work in Croatian for students and young professionals. This is an exciting career milestone for me, as it will be my first ever residency as a professional poet.
Your contribution will help fund my plane tickets to and from Pula, and transportation costs from Pula to Ližnjan and the surrounding areas.

Water</b></p>
<p>Hello, friends. And welcome to this three part
project designed to support my community, my family, and myself.</p>
<p><b>Part
One:</b></p>
<p>I live in Floyd County, Virginia, a place that
contains some of the purest, most exquisite water I have ever tasted. Though
the water here is clean and strong, it is also vulnerable. My intention is to
collect stories about water from Floyd County residents. I’d like to explore
their relationship to the water in their lives at the top of this high plateau.
Have there been any problems with drought, construction or contamination? What
is the value of water in their lives? How is their relationship to water
different than folks who primarily think of water as something that comes out
of a faucet and is provided as a service of a town or a city? At least 85% of the water
for residents of Floyd County comes from a spring or a well, not the town. As I
collect these stories, I’ll sort them into categories—some may help to
establish better protection for the water in Floyd County, and some may become
part of a book designed to celebrate and hold water.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/828907/files/20140902094446-holding_water_img.jpg?1409676286"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Part
Two:</b></p>
<p>I am really looking forward to asking my friends
who are writers if they will share some work about water for me to compile into a
collection of water stories, poems and essays. This will broaden the project
into the larger world and explore water on many different logistic, emotional
and metaphoric levels. Once I have those submissions in hand as well as
gatherings from my own community, I’d like to compile that collection into an anthology
called “Holding Water.” It is my intention to utilize this collection as a
fundraising effort to support our new environmental advocacy group ""Preserve Floyd: Citizens Preserving Floyd County"" so that we can do all that we can to protect the quality, quantity and
beauty of the water in Floyd. </p>

objective</b></p>
<p>KALI is about
a street girl who organizes motivational battle on perpetrators of violence. Highlighting the ways girls fight their tormentors on the
streets, workplaces and inside their own homes, the author wants to capture each girl’s
metamorphosis of anguish in to energy under the theme.</p>
<p>The immediate
task is to publish the eBook and printed version through self publishing, helping the voice to be heard over the readers in India and elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Need for funds</b></p>
<p>Author wants this motivation to
reach millions across the language groups and shades of ethnicities in India. Journey
starts from here. Mammoth nature of the task is the reason author taking this
route. This funding would mean strong footing to the aforesaid objective by
helping publication of the book in English as the first step.</p>
<p><b>Who
is KALI?</b></p>
<p>According to
mythology, <i>Kali </i>stands
for destruction of evil. When all gods failed, she, the most ferocious form of
goddess Durga, slaughtered the sinners and made all seven worlds safer for
innocents. Nothing could have been more troublesome for a mother than seeing
her daughters at this state. But this age is not for <i>avatars.</i>Time for action rather. A girl brought
up on the streets takes up this burden. She decides to shell these men, their
chauvinism, hypocrisies as she prepares for the battle. She approaches every
girl, soothes her by offering mother’s love; by instilling bravery, she makes
victim a potent weapon against the ongoing and seemingly never-ending genocide.</p>

objective
KALI is about
a street girl who organizes motivational battle on perpetrators of violence. Highlighting the ways girls fight their tormentors on the
streets, workplaces and inside their own homes, the author wants to capture each girl’s
metamorphosis of anguish in to energy under the theme.
The immediate
task is to publish the eBook and printed version through self publishing, helping the voice to be heard over the readers in India and elsewhere.
Need for funds
Author wants this motivation to
reach millions across the language groups and shades of ethnicities in India. Journey
starts from here. Mammoth nature of the task is the reason author taking this
route. This funding would mean strong footing to the aforesaid objective by
helping publication of the book in English as the first step.
Who
is KALI?
According to
mythology, Kali stands
for destruction of evil. When all gods failed, she, the most ferocious form of
goddess Durga, slaughtered the sinners and made all seven worlds safer for
innocents. Nothing could have been more troublesome for a mother than seeing
her daughters at this state. But this age is not for avatars.Time for action rather. A girl brought
up on the streets takes up this burden. She decides to shell these men, their
chauvinism, hypocrisies as she prepares for the battle. She approaches every
girl, soothes her by offering mother’s love; by instilling bravery, she makes
victim a potent weapon against the ongoing and seemingly never-ending genocide.

Africa, I was compelled to offer programs in schools to teach about the beauty
of the Barabaig tribe’s culture, as well as to inform about the scarcity of
basic needs for most in the world. I also sought to punctuate our shared
humanity that we are the human family as well as having a heart of service to
others. This tribe had much to teach us about the beauty of knowing how to
simply be. They were emotionally available, loving, grateful, peaceful, and
harmonious people, living simply in a village. I taught this in schools for
four years. Next, I found myself compelled to write a children’s book offering
a unique character to interest and ignite student’s imaginations. My hope was
that this book could more effectively teach empathy and how it relates to
caring about the plight of all people. I featured the tribe in the book. I
included the earth dam in the illustrations and culturally specific details to
the Barabaig tribe for further reinforcement of the messages.</span></p><p> <b><u>INTERNS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT</u></b><b><u> “Springing into Compassionate Action!”</u></b><strong><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>The collective efforts of eleven interns</span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'> from

me with a brain that had great difficulty with reading and writing. Following
my injury, I developed Jelly Beans Creative Learning (which uses a play-as-learning technique), and this inadvertently assisted my brain’s
healing, as well. I truly believe that when we focus outside ourselves in
service to others, we heal and grow (a message in the book)! My brain was now able to write more
consistently, including poetry, which took my cognition to a higher level. </p>
<p>In 2011, I felt compelled to write a story combining fiction
and reality to teach about the beauty of the Barabaig tribe in Africa who had
inspired me. I pondered it for quite a while, and one day it poured out of me.
I wrote on paper for six straight hours. It felt quite miraculous to me,
remembering a time when <i>Newsweek</i> was
read to me after my initial brain injury. The story was initially laid out in
prose, but I decided to offer the powerful magic of rhyme to youth, just as it
had helped me!</p><p><b><u>GOALS THAT ARE DEEPLY ROOTED!<span> </span></u></b>I believe there is profound healing potential for the developed and developing world in learning from and helping one another. It offers wholeness through connectedness. Encouraging and implementing a heart of service offers the potential for so much growth! We are sitting on such abundance in the developed world and but our youth and adults don’t feel whole or fulfilled. We have resources and knowledge to share with those in the world who don’t have the abundance we have, nor even basic needs met. There are enough resources for all. In turn, we have much to gain in learning another way of being, to be exposed to deep gratitude, to simply be, that I experienced with the Barabaig tribe. The joyfulness among those in the tribe was comforting and beautiful to behold. There is a connection and a beauty to being that we in the developed world would benefit from processing and then emulating. My existence made sense to me, as my heart felt more whole and one with mankind, in Africa. I actually found myself in culture shock when I came home to the developed world. The love here did not feel as readily available among people as compared to how it felt being, among the emotionally available, deeply loving people in the Barabaig tribe and in Tanzania.  I am confident that if youth could get on a band wagon about recycling, we need only inform them about the needs in our world for them to “spring into compassionate action.” ""Empowering youth with empathy” brings about this compassionate action! </p><p><b><u>BOOK, HAS BEEN USED AS CURRICULUM ALREADY! </u></b>I have implemented this book as curriculum for the past
three years. I am honored to hear overwhelmingly how much kids love the book.
The response from students confirms that when youth were given an opportunity to
learn about <b>empathy </b>that they would embody it in the classroom and
beyond. With play for learning, we recreated the scenes of the book, wore
clothing, made the earth dam, cage for the cheetah, and the mud hut. Students
were able to identify with the characters who modeled <b>empathy,</b> which
helped them better understand it.</p>
<p>During a recent week-long project, kids wrote on the board
about kindness and <b>empathy</b> and shared stories of having shown <b>empathy
</b>outside the<br/>
classroom. I loved hearing how easily and accurately they used the word in<br/>
sentences to describe opportunities where they showed empathy. </p>
<p>One little girl shared, “I was not as good as I should have
been in your class this morning but when I was at gym, when someone got hurt, I
showed him <b>empathy</b> by helping him up, since I know how it
feels to be hurt.”</p>
<p>When I introduced a rather sophisticated concept of <b>shared
humanity</b>—that we are the <b>human family</b>—I was blown away by the K
-3<sup>rd</sup> grader’s
understanding. In fact, I was brought to tears of gratitude and awe! They did
not parrot back, but made sense of it themselves and shared thoughtful
reflections to demonstrate their understanding. One child even came up with the
idea of creating an image to represent it. He said, “We should take the globe
and put it inside of a box and decorate it as a house, since we are all in one
family!” </p>
<p>I also overheard students make comments that “it feels so
good to be in a class where we all care about each other.” Classroom management
is less of an issue when we empower our youth with <b>emotional competence</b>,
when we<br/>
empower them with <b>empathy</b>.</p><p><strong>BULLYING, VIOLENCE, TOLERANCE.........</strong></p><ul><li>
<strong>Tolerance and Acceptance-I believe the messages, about the power of love and kindness are universal and of paramount importance to reinforce! I believe that where we teach love, kindness, empathy and that we are one in humanity, we will see more tolerance and acceptance. In teaching if we hurt someone else, we are really hurting ourselves, how could a person choose violence who understands this? How could someone not love and accept every human being who, really understands, we are all part of the human family and that we are one?</strong> </li></ul><p><b><u>I‘M A GRADUATE STUDENT!<span> </span></u></b>My graduate work is this book project, additional books (I
have written seven stories), and building my literary brand and the
business SissyMarySue (my pen name). SissyMarySue will produce books with
emotional competence, critical thinking, and world themes. I was thrilled to
have found an amazingly supportive graduate program called Human Development at
St. Mary’s University. (I could not have imagined a better advisor than Lee
Truer.)</p><span><p><b><u>BEAVER’S POND PRESS-A LOCAL MENTORING PRESS SUPPORTS BOOK!</u></b>To my absolute delight,
Beaver’s Pond Press, a local mentoring press, enthusiastically embraced my four-year
labor of love. Beaver’s Pond Press works with independent authors. Beaver’s
Pond Press deeply respected this collaboration and my desire to serve youth by writing
books with emotional competence and critical thinking themes. Beaver’s Pond
Press made my dream to launch this book a reality! My experience with Hanna has
included emotional support and encouragement that has been beyond exceptional.
She is the light that truly illuminates my vision and book—thank you, Hanna! It is humbling to have my first book launching.</p>
<p><b><u>LONG TERM VISION</u></b><u>—<b>Jelly Beans the Cheetah, character EVERYWHERE! </b></u>To share, powerfully, positive characters that children can emulate. The Cheetah is all about empathy, kindness, acceptance, resilience, tolerance and the power of love. Certainly that is more powerful than some of the images I see on backpacks, in video games or as the themes of parties, that do not stand for such admirable or life affirming attributes!</p>
<p>I see this story as a beautiful family and <strong>children’s film</strong>. I see it as either animated or set in Africa with the Jelly Beans Character, as a CGI character. I have written four subsequent stories with these characters that I intended for either a series of books or as the basis of a family/children's film. <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>I wish to have the book used as a tool for learning in schools! I plan to speak, train and lead others on the topic of empathy nationwide first! </strong></p>
<p><strong>I believe there is a world market for the book</strong>, as well, since the universal theme of feeling like you don't belong, is something all people can relate to as well as, all the other messages. I intend for it to ultimately be translated into many languages. </p>
<p>I see it used as a <strong>foreign language tool,</strong> to teach English, since the rhyming text helps with learning. I have found great value in teaching preschool age Spanish, taking advantage of many aspects of the story like identifying the colors on the Cheetah and numbers of Jelly Beans on his body and so on.  </p>
<p><strong>I see supporting products</strong>; plush animals that kids can adore, safari vehicles, puppets, action figures, dramatic play products, coloring and activity books and perhaps an American Girl, Nichole, with brown curly hair, too! I see an ap, an e-book where kids put animals on the pages, Smartboard/Promethean applications and computer learning tools based on characters.</p>
<p>SissyMarySue plans to become a multimedia/education business. The first phase involves publishing and will continue to evolve to ultimately include a variety of learning products and children's films.<strong> I have written a total of seven stories</strong>, four with the Jelly Beans and Hope characters and three others. All the stories have a focus on emotional competence and critical thinking, some will have world themes as well!</p>
<p>It is vitally important for me to partner with Heifer or a similar organization to channel some of my book revenue to the tribe and others in emerging countries in Africa and beyond. I also believe it would be special to partner with organizations to use some proceeds to help preserve this beautiful animal!</p>
<p><strong>I see any monetary success as a way to spread the messages and then be able to give back (donate) to the tribe and others in emerging countries, to model the heart of service, I am encouraging!!</strong><span>  </span></p>
<p><span>THANK YOU for reading my vision! Thank you for your support in any way! </span></p>
<p><span>I'd like to share a poem, I wrote that was inspired by the experience with the Barabaig tribe!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>We go through life quite a while</strong></span></p>
<p><span></span><span><strong>Logging many an emotional mile</strong></span></p>

The love here did not feel as readily available among people as compared to how it felt being, among the emotionally available, deeply loving people in the Barabaig tribe and in Tanzania.  I am confident that if youth could get on a band wagon about recycling, we need only inform them about the needs in our world for them to “spring into compassionate action.” ""Empowering youth with empathy” brings about this compassionate action! BOOK, HAS BEEN USED AS CURRICULUM ALREADY! I have implemented this book as curriculum for the past
three years. I am honored to hear overwhelmingly how much kids love the book.
The response from students confirms that when youth were given an opportunity to
learn about empathy that they would embody it in the classroom and
beyond. With play for learning, we recreated the scenes of the book, wore
clothing, made the earth dam, cage for the cheetah, and the mud hut. Students
were able to identify with the characters who modeled empathy, which
helped them better understand it.
During a recent week-long project, kids wrote on the board
about kindness and empathy and shared stories of having shown empathy
outside the
classroom. I loved hearing how easily and accurately they used the word in
sentences to describe opportunities where they showed empathy. 
One little girl shared, “I was not as good as I should have
been in your class this morning but when I was at gym, when someone got hurt, I
showed him empathy by helping him up, since I know how it
feels to be hurt.”
When I introduced a rather sophisticated concept of shared
humanity—that we are the human family—I was blown away by the K
-3rd grader’s
understanding. In fact, I was brought to tears of gratitude and awe! They did
not parrot back, but made sense of it themselves and shared thoughtful
reflections to demonstrate their understanding. One child even came up with the
idea of creating an image to represent it. He said, “We should take the globe
and put it inside of a box and decorate it as a house, since we are all in one
family!” 
I also overheard students make comments that “it feels so
good to be in a class where we all care about each other.” Classroom management
is less of an issue when we empower our youth with emotional competence,
when we
empower them with empathy.BULLYING, VIOLENCE, TOLERANCE.........
Tolerance and Acceptance-I believe the messages, about the power of love and kindness are universal and of paramount importance to reinforce! I believe that where we teach love, kindness, empathy and that we are one in humanity, we will see more tolerance and acceptance. In teaching if we hurt someone else, we are really hurting ourselves, how could a person choose violence who understands this? How could someone not love and accept every human being who, really understands, we are all part of the human family and that we are one? I‘M A GRADUATE STUDENT! My graduate work is this book project, additional books (I
have written seven stories), and building my literary brand and the
business SissyMarySue (my pen name). SissyMarySue will produce books with
emotional competence, critical thinking, and world themes. I was thrilled to
have found an amazingly supportive graduate program called Human Development at
St. Mary’s University. (I could not have imagined a better advisor than Lee
Truer.)BEAVER’S POND PRESS-A LOCAL MENTORING PRESS SUPPORTS BOOK!To my absolute delight,
Beaver’s Pond Press, a local mentoring press, enthusiastically embraced my four-year
labor of love. Beaver’s Pond Press works with independent authors. Beaver’s
Pond Press deeply respected this collaboration and my desire to serve youth by writing
books with emotional competence and critical thinking themes. Beaver’s Pond
Press made my dream to launch this book a reality! My experience with Hanna has
included emotional support and encouragement that has been beyond exceptional.
She is the light that truly illuminates my vision and book—thank you, Hanna! It is humbling to have my first book launching.
LONG TERM VISION—Jelly Beans the Cheetah, character EVERYWHERE! To share, powerfully, positive characters that children can emulate. The Cheetah is all about empathy, kindness, acceptance, resilience, tolerance and the power of love. Certainly that is more powerful than some of the images I see on backpacks, in video games or as the themes of parties, that do not stand for such admirable or life affirming attributes!
I see this story as a beautiful family and children’s film. I see it as either animated or set in Africa with the Jelly Beans Character, as a CGI character. I have written four subsequent stories with these characters that I intended for either a series of books or as the basis of a family/children's film.  
I wish to have the book used as a tool for learning in schools! I plan to speak, train and lead others on the topic of empathy nationwide first! 
I believe there is a world market for the book, as well, since the universal theme of feeling like you don't belong, is something all people can relate to as well as, all the other messages. I intend for it to ultimately be translated into many languages. 
I see it used as a foreign language tool, to teach English, since the rhyming text helps with learning. I have found great value in teaching preschool age Spanish, taking advantage of many aspects of the story like identifying the colors on the Cheetah and numbers of Jelly Beans on his body and so on.  
I see supporting products; plush animals that kids can adore, safari vehicles, puppets, action figures, dramatic play products, coloring and activity books and perhaps an American Girl, Nichole, with brown curly hair, too! I see an ap, an e-book where kids put animals on the pages, Smartboard/Promethean applications and computer learning tools based on characters.
SissyMarySue plans to become a multimedia/education business. The first phase involves publishing and will continue to evolve to ultimately include a variety of learning products and children's films. I have written a total of seven stories, four with the Jelly Beans and Hope characters and three others. All the stories have a focus on emotional competence and critical thinking, some will have world themes as well!
It is vitally important for me to partner with Heifer or a similar organization to channel some of my book revenue to the tribe and others in emerging countries in Africa and beyond. I also believe it would be special to partner with organizations to use some proceeds to help preserve this beautiful animal!
I see any monetary success as a way to spread the messages and then be able to give back (donate) to the tribe and others in emerging countries, to model the heart of service, I am encouraging!!  
THANK YOU for reading my vision! Thank you for your support in any way! 
I'd like to share a poem, I wrote that was inspired by the experience with the Barabaig tribe!
We go through life quite a while
Logging many an emotional mile
Before it becomes clear
The beauty of life has always been here
We had been too consumed to see
The simplicity and beauty to simply be!

<h3>A Little About The Book</h3>
<p>Sisters of Element is the first book in a series about the Luna sisters, four Mexican American young women living in present day Percival Falls, Washington. Lina, Val, Zo and Rory Luna have special abilities based on the elements: water, fire, air, and earth. Having lost their parents at an early age, the sisters have a nearly unbreakable bond. When faced with a dark force that threatens their very existence, they don’t hesitate to fiercely protect each other—even if it means the ultimate sacrifice.</p>
<p>Lina has it all - her soulmate Gabriel, a dream job, and a close-knit relationship with her younger sisters. Meeting her sister Val's new boyfriend triggers a series of nightmares about the safety of her sister. Little does she know, she and her family are in even more danger than she could have imagined.</p>
<p>Readers will go on a magical and mysterious journey with the Luna sisters. The characters share their inner strength, their sacrifice, their resilience, and the powerful bond of sisterhood. At its heart, Sisters of Element is a story about unconditional love and how with it, you can overcome even the greatest obstacles.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i><strong>Wake Up Call: How the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Created a Call to Action for Nonprofits</strong></i> tells the story of how smaller nonprofits use social media and provides suggestions on how nonprofits should use social media as a part of their overall marketing and organizational strategy. It also captures the story of one woman’s journey with ALS from pre-diagnosis to today.<br/><br/>My name is Deb Finch and I am the author of <i><strong>Wake Up Call: How the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Created a Call to Action for Nonprofits.</strong></i> I wrote this book because I have seen how smaller nonprofits struggle to effectively utilize social media and I want to help them improve. “More posts” is NOT a strategy. #MPISNS<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance of marketing, particularly for smaller nonprofits. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for nonprofits in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you improve your social media by effectively using your nonprofit’s mission to tell your story.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about nonprofit marketing and how to better utilize social media:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge was able to successfully use social media through storytelling, videos, and a call to action, aided by hashtags and sharing </li>
<li>Social media marketing for nonprofits through examples and recommendations</li>
<li>A story from the book: Melanie’s incredible journey from diagnosis of ALS to learning how to live with it - and the role marketing plays in nonprofit organizations</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>Wake Up Call: How the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Created a Call to Action for Nonprofits</strong></i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to students, nonprofit organizations, and those who want to know more about what it is like to receive a diagnosis of ALS. This book is also for those who are looking at nonprofit marketing and a career in nonprofits for the first time.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you remember the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, care about nonprofit organizations, and want to learn effective marketing tactics to reach your goals.<br/><br/>There are many nonprofits that provide services for ALS patients. Imagine what life would be like without these important sources of support and encouragement. To that end, all proceeds of this book when I publish will go to Compassionate Care ALS in Falmouth, MA, which provides services, funds, and equipment for those with ALS.</p>
<p>The Book - <i><strong>Wake Up Call: How the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge Created a Call to Action for Nonprofits</strong></i></p>
<p>The book is written in two parts:<br/><br/>Part [1] contains the introduction + seven chapters. In this section of the book you will learn about the disease ALS, the history of nonprofits in the United States, and the difference between charity and philanthropy. We’ll also examine what lead up to the success of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge and how/why social media has become such an influence on our daily lives. Nonprofits struggle to strategically use social media for further their cause. <i>Remember, <strong>“More posts” is not a strategy!</strong></i><strong> </strong>#MPINS<br/><br/>Part [2] contains Chapters 8-12. This section of the book explains why it is important to have a marketing plan that aligns with the mission and goals of the nonprofit. Everyone in the nonprofit needs to think of themselves as part of the marketing team—looking and listening for stories that provide an inside look at the work of the nonprofit. The book provides examples of successful storytelling, how to get everyone in your organization on board with marketing, and why it matters. A story could develop around a volunteer experience, client experience, results of a donation, fundraising, education... there are so many opportunities that are sitting right in front of us that don’t get shared. Capturing these and sharing the experiences will engage people, both outside and inside the organization.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Fanged: Blood and Water</strong> is a book about a man discovering his humanity while battling his overpowering monster half.<br/><br/>Silas Ravnos didn’t always have a normal life. He lived with monsters, literal ones, but now he hunts them. Just when Silas thinks he’s safe, his monster family comes crashing back in. <br/><br/>My name is Tianna Le’Ray and I am the author of Fanged: Blood and Water. I wrote this book because as a child, I used to write for my peers, still do even as an adult. (I remember I once wrote an episodic about Sailor Moon as a 5th grader.) So, I decided to embark on a creative project to finally see my story come to life. I also wanted to see better representation in books I read.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, <strong>you will escape the struggles of everyday life and learn beside Silas that love is something everyone deserves.</strong> Alongside him, <strong>you will also learn how to fight your inner demons. </strong><br/><br/>Silas has forsaken his family and likes it that way. You see, his family are monsters, not in the poetic sense, but real monsters hell bent on destruction and death. After ten long years, Silas receives a call from his mother, Lenora. She wants him back and mommy always gets what she wants. Silas is tasked with finding Harper, a girl who holds a powerful secret, but the more he gets to know her, the more he begins to fall for her charm. And if that isn’t bad enough, he has competition. If Silas isn’t careful, there’s more that will be at stake than the current status of his love life.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you love <strong>action</strong> and <strong>fantasy</strong> with a <strong>touch of romance.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Fanged: Blood and Water</strong> speaks to <strong>adults</strong> and <strong>fantasy buffs</strong> who want to grapple with <strong>love and monsters in a new way.</strong><br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <strong>Fanged: Blood and Water</strong> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p><strong>Do I let my inner monster control me?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In our world where there are no monsters, who are the real ones?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How do you preserve your soul?</strong></p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing family dynamics, love, and humanity will change us all for the better. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Fanged: Blood and Water is a book about a man discovering his humanity while battling his overpowering monster half.Silas Ravnos didn’t always have a normal life. He lived with monsters, literal ones, but now he hunts them. Just when Silas thinks he’s safe, his monster family comes crashing back in. My name is Tianna Le’Ray and I am the author of Fanged: Blood and Water. I wrote this book because as a child, I used to write for my peers, still do even as an adult. (I remember I once wrote an episodic about Sailor Moon as a 5th grader.) So, I decided to embark on a creative project to finally see my story come to life. I also wanted to see better representation in books I read.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will escape the struggles of everyday life and learn beside Silas that love is something everyone deserves. Alongside him, you will also learn how to fight your inner demons. Silas has forsaken his family and likes it that way. You see, his family are monsters, not in the poetic sense, but real monsters hell bent on destruction and death. After ten long years, Silas receives a call from his mother, Lenora. She wants him back and mommy always gets what she wants. Silas is tasked with finding Harper, a girl who holds a powerful secret, but the more he gets to know her, the more he begins to fall for her charm. And if that isn’t bad enough, he has competition. If Silas isn’t careful, there’s more that will be at stake than the current status of his love life.You will love this book if you love action and fantasy with a touch of romance.Fanged: Blood and Water speaks to adults and fantasy buffs who want to grapple with love and monsters in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that Fanged: Blood and Water inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
Do I let my inner monster control me?
In our world where there are no monsters, who are the real ones?
How do you preserve your soul?
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing family dynamics, love, and humanity will change us all for the better.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<br/><i>Unblocking Blockchain</i> lays out a framework about how to take your company through its Blockchain journey. Drawing on real-world experiences of early adopters, the book reveals practices that have helped company leaders stay at the center of Blockchain technology evolution. These lessons can help you design a business strategy using Blockchain to create value for your company and be prepared for any possible disruptions to its business model.<br/><br/>My name is <strong>Rahul Prakash</strong>, and I am the author of <i>Unblocking Blockchain</i>. I was inspired to write this book as I went through a personal journey to uncover the hype from Blockchain technology's reality. I wrote this book to share insights from my inquiry with business and technology leaders who are asking the same question. The book will also give me an opportunity to connect with others interested the possibilities of Blockchain and continue the conversation.<br/><br/>As you read this book, you will discover the promise of Blockchain as a new operating system of business, providing an infrastructure layer, and helping us safely exchange value. Through this book, I hope to instill in you, the same passion and excitement, that I have, for socio-technological phenomenon, called Blockchain. Ultimately, I want this book to help you stay at the edge of innovation as Blockchain reshapes the competitive landscape.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about what the journey around Blockchain could look like for your company. You start with experimentation around the technology by taking some time to learn it, decide use-case to pursue and run a proof-of-concept. In the process you realize that Blockchain is a team sport, and to succeed, you need to play with others. Including more and more people to build the network and getting them around the table, makes it hard. We also discuss how to be prepared for typical challenges faced and some advanced work being done in Blockchain space combined with Internet Of Things &amp; Artificial Intelligence.<br/><br/>Recognized as an innovative leader looking to push the envelope of technology transformation using emerging Blockchain technology, you will love this book.<br/><br/><i>Unblocking Blockchain</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to leaders who want to leverage Blockchain technology to drive business value. The book will help business leaders understand what Blockchain can do for their business and prepare them to have meaningful dialogue with their technology counterparts. The book will also help technology leaders understand the possibilities of Blockchain and translate that to business language while striving to future-proof the company's technology foundation.<br/> <h3>The Book - Unblocking Blockchain</h3>
<br/>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1: In the initial chapters we level set on what Blockchain is and get grounded in basic lexicon of the technology for an easier understanding of further conversation.<br/><br/>Part 2: In this section we learn from the early adopters and get a view into how they approached their Blockchain journey, the choices they made and the lessons learnt from their experience.<br/><br/>Part 3: In this section we hear from folks who are working at the frontiers and further stretching the envelope of Blockchain technology. And we wrap up by looking at a framework to inform your Blockchain journey.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>

<p><i>What's The Bravest Thing You Need To Do Right Now?</i><br/><br/>My name is Nicole Bianchi, and I am the author of <i>What's the Bravest Thing You Need To Do Right Now?</i>  I wrote this book because the common missing element in my work with leaders is bravery. Are you ready to explore how leaders who live a life of Bravership® grow influence, accomplish more and fear less? You will learn how to build the skill of bravery--how to be bold with your boss, peers, and employees; practice and encourage open communication; build a network that helps you make the bold choices.<br/><br/>Leaders want to be more courageous, but they sometimes aren’t sure how. Leadership is a journey. Being a braver leader is a journey. Bravery + Leadership... Bravership creates a competitive advantage for you, and it takes small brave moves to get there.<br/><br/>I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover how small brave moves made daily will compound over time. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same passion and excitement for being a braver leader. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to develop your bravery, helping you grow influence, accomplish more, and fear less.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Bravery + Leadership Disciplines and the Mindsets, Behaviors, and Habits of leaders who are practicing everyday bravery. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>How Barry Posner, a leadership scholar and co-author of A Leadership Challenge and A Leaders Legacy, thinks about bravery + leadership.</li>
<li>The Being Brave moments of many CEO’s, business owners, and leaders.</li>
<li>How leaders intentionally craft a culture of bravery for them and others to thrive in.</li>
<li>The lasting impact of Bravership in action: The impact that one person practicing small brave moves had on a young leader, ultimately saving her life.</li>
<li>You will love this book if you know you can be and wish to be braver personally and/or professionally!</li>
</ul>
<p><br/><i>What's the Bravest Thing You Need To Do Right Now? </i>is a nonfiction book that speaks to emerging, first-time and experienced leaders who want to look at being braver and leading in a new way. </p>

Story of My Book
What's The Bravest Thing You Need To Do Right Now?My name is Nicole Bianchi, and I am the author of What's the Bravest Thing You Need To Do Right Now?  I wrote this book because the common missing element in my work with leaders is bravery. Are you ready to explore how leaders who live a life of Bravership® grow influence, accomplish more and fear less? You will learn how to build the skill of bravery--how to be bold with your boss, peers, and employees; practice and encourage open communication; build a network that helps you make the bold choices.Leaders want to be more courageous, but they sometimes aren’t sure how. Leadership is a journey. Being a braver leader is a journey. Bravery + Leadership... Bravership creates a competitive advantage for you, and it takes small brave moves to get there.I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover how small brave moves made daily will compound over time. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same passion and excitement for being a braver leader. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to develop your bravery, helping you grow influence, accomplish more, and fear less.In this book, you'll learn about Bravery + Leadership Disciplines and the Mindsets, Behaviors, and Habits of leaders who are practicing everyday bravery. You'll hear stories such as...

How Barry Posner, a leadership scholar and co-author of A Leadership Challenge and A Leaders Legacy, thinks about bravery + leadership.
The Being Brave moments of many CEO’s, business owners, and leaders.
How leaders intentionally craft a culture of bravery for them and others to thrive in.
The lasting impact of Bravership in action: The impact that one person practicing small brave moves had on a young leader, ultimately saving her life.
You will love this book if you know you can be and wish to be braver personally and/or professionally!

What's the Bravest Thing You Need To Do Right Now? is a nonfiction book that speaks to emerging, first-time and experienced leaders who want to look at being braver and leading in a new way.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Anxiously Thriving</i> is a book about social anxiety disorder and how it impacts various aspects of teenagers’ and young adults’ lives like their school &amp; university life, professional life, dating life, friendships, and more. The book explores the intersections of mental health in South Asian communities and the impact anxiety can have on teenage and early adulthood years.<br/><br/>My name is Shubhechha Dhar and I am the author of <i>Anxiously Thriving</i>. I wrote this book because of my personal story with social anxiety disorder (SAD). I had SAD for eight years without even knowing it as I grew up in a South Asian community where mental health was not a topic of discussion. Wanting to have social interactions and not being able to was isolating and I felt all alone in my struggles. I know that there are thousands of other teenagers and young adults who are going through the same thing that I did and I hope to provide support to them through my book.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that not just surviving but thriving with SAD is possible. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the topic of mental health and the importance of having open conversations about it. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to support you as you navigate life with SAD or are a family member/friend of someone with SAD who wants to provide support.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn stories of people with SAD and how they were able to cope with it and thrive in their lives. You'll hear stories from...</p>
<ul>
<li>People with SAD who were too anxious to speak in their classrooms and are now TEDx speakers, motivational speakers, musicians, successful YouTubers, and more</li>
<li>People with anxiety disorders who share how counseling helped them cope with their anxiety</li>
<li>Therapists, psychologists, &amp; counselors who share their insights on coping with SAD</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a teenager or young adult who struggles with social anxiety or a parent or family member of someone who does. This book can also be beneficial if you want to see how people with social anxiety can thrive in their lives.</p>

<h3><strong><u>A Word from Susan and Lexi Haas</u></strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>The</i></strong><strong><i> Year of the Buttered Cat</i></strong> is a middle grade (and up!) memoir based on the real-life story of how Lexi  discovered that something terrible, something criminal, happened to her right after birth—something that left her with an out-of-control body and without a voice. We worked on it for years and are so excited to be able to share it with you soon.</p>
<p>The book alternates between two timeframes: first you’ll see Lexi as a precocious, superhero-obsessed teen counting down the final 24 hours to a risky brain surgery that might help her talk or—dare she dream it?—to walk and use her hands. As her surgery grows closer, she finds an urgent, relentless need to share the story of the year in her  life she calls “the year of the buttered cat.”</p>
<p>That year, when Lexi was five years old and on the verge of shutting out the rest of the world, she began a lonely quest to find her “missing” body. After the family cat went missing, too, and a mysterious letter appeared, she reluctantly enlisted two budding friends to aid her search. But when these friends also disappeared, Lexi had to learn new ways to reach out to the world to save her friendships and uncover the truth about what happened to her as a baby.</p>

<h3><strong><u>A Letter from Lexi’s doctor</u></strong></h3>
<p>“I hope you will enjoy reading this book and getting to know Lexi. I have known Lexi for most of her life—ever since her mother brought her to see me when she was a baby. Like many of the children I see in my clinic, Lexi has kernicterus.</p>
<p>In <strong><i>The Year of the Buttered Cat, </i></strong>you’ll learn that bilirubin inside a newborn’s body makes skin and eyes yellow, or jaundiced. Most babies have some jaundice from slightly elevated levels of bilirubin. This mild jaundice in newborn babies is normal and not dangerous. But sometimes the level of bilirubin in the blood gets too high and gets into the brain. This can be dangerous. It can damage parts of the baby’s brain and cause what Lexi has, kernicterus.</p>
<p>It is important to know that not all babies who have jaundice will get kernicterus. Only a very few have so much jaundice and bilirubin that it is dangerous. By testing early and often with a blood test or a special skin sensor these babies can be treated to prevent permanent lifelong damage. Newborn jaundice needs to be managed to make certain that all babies have the same chance for a normal life. Doctors and nurses, medical providers, and parents need to be educated about jaundice and bilirubin and know how to follow simple guidelines to test for and prevent kernicterus. Everyone should know about it and help spread the word about testing newborns to prevent kernicterus from happening.” —<strong>Dr. Steven M. Shapiro</strong>, Former Chief, Division of Neurology, Children’s Mercy Hospital Kansas City</p>

<h3><strong><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Because we've gone through the process of publishing books a few times now (25 to be exact), we are pretty clear on our printing and fulfillment process. We have a top-notch printer who has never once been late with a print job. There are inherent risks in publishing a book: will it get good reviews, will it win any awards, will it sell copies, but none of these things will keep the book from getting into the world. There are new challenges to book publishing with the presence of Covid-19 changing the way the book industry works in ways we've yet to discover. We think the best way to mitigate this particular challenge is to reach out to our supportive community.</p>

<h3><strong><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></strong></h3>
<p>We would love it if you can contribute, but there are other ways beyond contributions that you could help us meet our goals. We'd be so thrilled if you got the word out to your networks of friends, family, and colleagues about our campaign to get the word out about <i><strong>The Year of the Buttered Cat</strong></i> and its mission to raise awareness about jaundice and kernicterus. Indiegogo has some great share tools that makes it easy to make some noise about our campaign! </p>

About Penny Candy Books and Penelope Editions
Small press. Big conversations. Award-winning books for a wide range of readers.
Penny Candy Books is an independent children’s book publishing company based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Greensboro, North Carolina. Founded in 2015 by poets Alexis Orgera and Chad Reynolds, Penny Candy released its first title in the fall of 2016.  Our imprint, Penelope Editions, released a coloring book in 2017 and its first middle grade novel in 2020.
At Penny Candy Books we have a twofold mission for our books: to create conversations and to publish children's literature that reflects the diverse realities of the world we live in, both at home and abroad. This means seeking out books by and about people and subjects that speak to and from a broad range of human experience. Our mission for Penelope Editions is to publish young adult and middle grade books with guts and vision.
 
Risks & Challenges

Because we've gone through the process of publishing books a few times now (25 to be exact), we are pretty clear on our printing and fulfillment process. We have a top-notch printer who has never once been late with a print job. There are inherent risks in publishing a book: will it get good reviews, will it win any awards, will it sell copies, but none of these things will keep the book from getting into the world. There are new challenges to book publishing with the presence of Covid-19 changing the way the book industry works in ways we've yet to discover. We think the best way to mitigate this particular challenge is to reach out to our supportive community.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
We would love it if you can contribute, but there are other ways beyond contributions that you could help us meet our goals. We'd be so thrilled if you got the word out to your networks of friends, family, and colleagues about our campaign to get the word out about The Year of the Buttered Cat and its mission to raise awareness about jaundice and kernicterus. Indiegogo has some great share tools that makes it easy to make some noise about our campaign!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I wrote this book because in my journey to learn French to fluency I wanted to share my own experiences, conversations with friends &amp; experts, &amp; the research I have conducted on the psychology behind language acquisition, while also highlighting mistakes myself &amp; others have made so you don’t have to.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to effectively achieve fluency in that language you have always dreamed of mastering. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for foreign language &amp; the ability to speak any language you want. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you unlock what I call “Dual-Literacy,” that is, to not only speak at least two languages but to be articulate in your new tongue &amp; also your native one.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn how to chart &amp; navigate your language learning experience, all the while discovering what learning responsibilities will lead to your personal growth. You'll hear stories such as...</p><ul>
<li>How I regained the ability to speak &amp; read French overnight in France not having practiced since nearly failing French in high school four years prior</li>
<li>The night I was an Ugly American &amp; sweated naked in a 199 degree Fahrenheit Czech sauna in the middle of a murder forest with my host family who didn’t speak English &amp; I didn’t speak Czech</li>
<li>And how a Nepali &amp; Russian learned Hindi &amp; English to full fluency by watching Bollywood &amp; American TV &amp; how you can apply what they used to learn your target language</li>
<li>Among many more...</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you took a foreign language class &amp; embarrassed yourself in front of everyone by butchering pronunciation. You will be pulled into this book when the learning methods seem SO obvious you will wonder why you never were taught them in school. And, you will love the bizarre adventures I take you on, that show just how strange &amp; amazing learning a second language can be.<br/><br/><i>To Speak Is To See</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to people who have always wanted to but struggled to acquire a second language and anyone who tried to learn a language in school &amp; thought they learned nothing, both of which who want to look at language learning and self-development in a new way.<br/> </p><h3>The Book - To Speak Is To See</h3><p><br/>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters <i>Anglophonosphere</i>, <i>Speaking ‘Merican</i>, <i>Ugly American</i>, &amp; <i>Hope Yet</i>. In Part 1 we explore language learning globally &amp; in English-speaking countries to uncover why countries like the US, UK, &amp; Canada struggle to teach second languages to fluency, examining both statistical &amp; geographic evidence paired with accounts of experts &amp; students who studied a foreign language.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters <i>Foundations of Linguistics</i>, <i>Counting in 10 Languages at Once</i>, &amp; <i>Slang Gang</i>. Here we take a look at the odd world of languages, unexpected connections between languages, &amp; dive into the fundamentals of the science that is linguistics &amp; how understanding basic linguistic concepts can help you understand the world at large.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters <i>Embracing the Inner Child</i>; <i>Zipf, Nada, Nothing</i>; <i>Input-Output</i>; <i>Totally Goals</i>; <i>Door-Wedging</i>, &amp; <i>A Healthy Body is a Healthy Mind</i>.

In a sentence: I need money to print a magazine; a collection of work that encompasses creativity, inspiration and ambition. 



It's very important that Lionheart Magazine is printed, not simply online. I want it to be a collectable, a treasure and something a reader can take everywhere with them; as well as snip up, post up and feel the satisfaction of a printed collection of images and words.

LIONHEART MAGAZINE needs more than my own funding to become a printed publication. I would love it if you could help me see it become a reality. Just a small donation would be absolutely marvelous and hugely appreciated.
I know that the figure seems bizarre and picked from obscurity, but it is what I need to get things printing and going. Each one pound will equate to one whisker closer to Lionheart Magazine's production.

The Impact

I shall be very happy.

I hope that people will feel really very good reading Lionheart Magazine. Not just whilst reading it, but for a while after. Maybe even have some sort of lasting impression.

I will work tirelessly on getting it printed but you could help with just a little donation. HONESTLY, it would be amazing.

<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>My name is Sarah Smith-Vanek and thank you so much for taking the time to check out this page! So here's whats going on- I've been given a rare opportunity. I've found a highly rated freelance editor who believes in my book as much as I do. She wants to take my manuscript and perfect it so I have the best possible chance of landing a place with a literary agent who would then work to sell my books. This is a huge step for me and now I need your help.</p>
<p>For most of my life I was a professional actress but when I wasn't on stage I was always writing. I wrote children's stories and poems, anything with an edge of the otherworldly or fantastic.</p>
<p>In 2010 I was doing a show in Tucson, Arizona and I began writing what I thought was going to be short children's story about a young girl who finds a hidden world in her backyard hedge, it became so much more.</p>
<p>Pretty soon I was writing all the time, between scene's during performances, during rehearsals, before and after shows, if I wasn't on stage, I was writing. The story had me and wouldn't let go.  After a relocation to Los Angeles I began to focus on writing Beyond The Lilac Hedge and the two sequels that would complete the Saga of Windalai during the day while waiting tables at night to pay the bills.</p>
<p>Six years and eight drafts later the first book, Beyond The Lilac Hedge, is complete and ready for the editing process.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I'm living on waitress's income which doesn't leave room for anything other than bills so I'm doing something that's difficult for me, I'm asking for help.</p>
<p>Any and all contributions to this campaign would go directly to the fee's laid out by my editor, the lovely and talented Rebecca Spence. Rebecca has worked with award winning writers and first timers like me. Her skill as an editor has propelled the careers of of many writers and I hope to be next on the list. You can read more about her at <a href=""http://www.rebeccaspence.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rebeccaspence.com</a></p>
<p>With your help I can take the crucial last step toward having a manuscript all shined up and ready for submission to literary agents and publishing houses. This book has become an all consuming dream that with your help, I can achieve.</p>
<p>If you'd like a small taste of the book, keep scrolling! I've posted an excerpt below.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>I'm attempting to raise about 3000 dollars to cover all the time and effort it's going to take Rebecca over the next six months to clean up the manuscript. I'm hoping to have a clean product to begin submitting by mid June 2017.</p>
<p>What's in it for you? Well, I'm glad you asked! I have a few perks to check out! Everything from a personalized thank you to a digital copy of the edited manuscript!</p>
<p>Even if I'm only able to raise a small amount it will help to cover part of editing costs.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why this book?</h3>
<p>Beyond The Lilac Hedge is a story of survival, hope, loss and the fight to overcome tyranny. Our Heroine, Emmaline Faye, goes from being a painfully shy sixteen year old girl to a fierce warrior with the fate of two worlds resting on her young shoulders.</p>
<p>In the current political climate I believe it's important to flood our youth and young adults with as many stories of fiercely strong women and diverse characters as possible. This book has a strong cast of ethnically diverse characters as well as several with varied sexual preference that shape Emmaline along the way. You'll find a short excerpt from the book below.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Book one of the Windalai Saga</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">By Sarah Smith-Vanek</h3> <p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>
<p>“<i>And as the seasons come and go, here's something you might like to know. There are fairies everywhere: under bushes, in the air, playing games just like you play, singing through their busy day. So listen, touch, and look around - in the air and on the ground. And if you watch all nature's things, you might just see a fairy's wing.</i>” ~Author Unknown</p> <p>    Number Seven Rosetree Lane was said to be haunted. The seemingly ancient house at the far end of the block had been boarded up for as long as anyone could remember. Even Old Mrs. Hubbard who had grown up next door in Number Five, who, on that very night had celebrated her ninety seventh birthday, couldn't remember a time when someone had lived in Number Seven.</p>
<p>The dilapidated Victorian with its saggy front porch, and peeling dingy white paint,  loomed over the otherwise charming street with a terrifying authority.  The neighborhood children were frightened to retrieve runaway balls or kites that had strayed into the weed littered front yard; on Halloween only the bravest of the neighborhood teenagers would dare to stand for a few seconds on its wide wilted porch.</p>
<p>    However Number Seven wasn't haunted, it was just a big lonely house and like most old lonely houses it guarded a secret. A secret Number Seven had kept safe for well over one hundred years.</p>
<p>    On this night, the night of old Mrs. Hubbard's ninety seventh birthday, the secret the old house guarded so well, began to make itself known. For while the neighborhood slept, bellies filled with cake and strawberry ice cream, tiny lights appeared in the lilac hedge behind Number Seven.</p>
<p>    Slowly the lights began to drift toward the house, hundreds, then thousands, until the entire house seemed to disappear beneath a curtain of fireflies. The light radiated from inside the house casting shadows on the now manicured lawn. All night the tiny lights danced until the first light of dawn, when one by one they drifted back into the lilac hedge and vanished.</p>
<p>    As the sun began its slow morning climb casting a soft pink glow over Rosetree lane, a woman emerged from the backyard of the vacant Number Seven.  Her bare feet were silent on the cobblestone path as she made her way to the wide front porch.  Her  silvery blond hair streaming behind her, her long silk skirts flowing gently in the early morning breeze. The petite woman bent, scooping a squirming bundle up into her arms. She stood for a moment looking out over Rosetree Lane. She smiled to herself before entering the house and firmly closed the door behind her.  A door, that only hours before had been boarded up with coarse plywood panels.</p>
<p>    In that one night, as if by magic, Number Seven Rosetree lane had been completely restored. The paint on the porch shone a bright white in the amber light of the rising sun. The yard was a perfect carpet of velvet green. The shutters had been freshly painted a sunny yellow; there were even curtains with lace and a print of tiny rose buds fluttering in the turret windows. In one short night, Number Seven had become a home...</p>

Beyond the Lilac Hedge
Book one of the Windalai Saga
By Sarah Smith-Vanek Prologue
“And as the seasons come and go, here's something you might like to know. There are fairies everywhere: under bushes, in the air, playing games just like you play, singing through their busy day. So listen, touch, and look around - in the air and on the ground.

Even Old Mrs. Hubbard who had grown up next door in Number Five, who, on that very night had celebrated her ninety seventh birthday, couldn't remember a time when someone had lived in Number Seven.
The dilapidated Victorian with its saggy front porch, and peeling dingy white paint,  loomed over the otherwise charming street with a terrifying authority.  The neighborhood children were frightened to retrieve runaway balls or kites that had strayed into the weed littered front yard; on Halloween only the bravest of the neighborhood teenagers would dare to stand for a few seconds on its wide wilted porch.
    However Number Seven wasn't haunted, it was just a big lonely house and like most old lonely houses it guarded a secret. A secret Number Seven had kept safe for well over one hundred years.

<p>A few days ago, I posted a question on my facebook page: ""Should my next book be about contemplative knitting? Or men who knit?""</p>
<p>The answer was decidedly, ""BOTH!""</p>
<p>Then Phillip and I were talking a few days ago about the project when we just couldn't figure out the correct angle for what I was trying to say. Contemplative knitting....so many people have written about the zen of knitting, to great success. Those are some wonderful books. But, I didn't want to do what someone else had already done. Men that knit....kinda....well...ok. And? What's the big deal, right? Men knit....the book ended in the title.</p>
<p>Heading to the bathroom, Phillip quipped,  ""You should write about all the behind the scenes stuff, what you really go through as a knitter.....some of the stuff you DON'T write on your blog. Sometimes that knitting world is just as vicious and gossipy as Hollywood....""</p>
<p>He got it. Oh he got it, he got it, and he got it HOT. THAT is a book worth writing: the back stage, behind the scenes look at a man who has a contemplative life through knitting....and all the madness that circles around him. Like the time Deborah Norville poo pooed me on live TV. Or the time I got into a heated fight with a very well known and established male knitter because of the Pulse night club shooting. How I lost a thousand followers for a political belief. How I was offered a reality show, they asked in the interview for me to take off my ball cap and I said, ""Nope. It's my look. Deal with it. After all, this isn't an audition for Naked and Afraid.....is it???""</p>
<p>There are so many juicy moments that don't get explored enough in this life of a male knitter. Some of them controversial, some of them joyous. Some of them got me pushed out of the knitting community and some of them invited me in even further.</p>
<p>There are so many great juicy moments that have happened on this end that we never wrote about. Yes, because they were too controversial. (So controversial that I don't think Lionbrand wants to talk to me anymore...and that's in the book, too). But, this book touches on all of that. Oh, yes, we got to work right away. Using my blog as a diary, we were able to look back and go, ""Oh! Remember this was happening at the same time, and we didn't DARE write about it!"" Oh, yes, we made sure to include everything that we didn't think was appropriate for the blog because I didn't want to get all.....what's the word? Gossipy? </p>
<p>Now, I wasn't keen on it being my version of incidents that trashed people. Nope. You see, when you mix those moments with the good moments, you begin to see that the life of this male knitter has been an interesting ride. And I LEARNED so much about it's blessings and it's few curses. I got to make friends all across the globe, and I got to go deeper into a place in my soul that the usual practices of contemplation didn't allow. I couldn't sit with the eyes closed and be mindful. I had to pick up knitting needles and listen to the world, what it said about itself, what it said about me.....and what my own soul had been desperate to tell me: that the worth of a man is valued not in his possessions, but in his actions.</p>
<p>So, this new book will lean in closer on the backstory, in detail, the good moments, the rough moments. The times we shined, the times we failed, and all the things I wanted to say, but didn't have the courage to at the time. It leans in closer to the contemplative side of what all those moments meant, what they taught, and how they shaped me into the man I am now. From homeless, to somewhat famous, to then shunned, then reborn with the truth that knitting taught me. </p>
<p>I've started an indiegogo campaign, to see if I could generate interest. I've started floating the cover of the book around. I have a good feeling  about this book. It really does say everything that should have been said, not because all of it was raunchy and controversial, but because I just didn't have the courage at the time. But, hell, if we're going for broke then we might as well put it all out there....</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","ALL ABOUT ME OR EMPATHY? 
The magical dancing triplets, Candi, Cookie and Coco Birthday will be role models for children around the world. By bringing surprise parties to those who have been forgotten on their birthdays, the triplets teach kindness, empathy and generosity. Through their imaginative and comical stories, the emphasis is on empowering girls and the joy that comes with giving.
 Only through your support can their influence be possible! Up to the first $10,000 will be towards their second book in the series. 
 
 

Granny Rosie felt sad. ""I should have known that AGAIN I'd be spending my birthday alone."" 
From the book, The Birthday Triplets. 

When Granny Rosie decides to make a Birthday Adventure for herself, everything goes comically wrong. That is...

until Cookie, Candi, and Coco dance into Granny Rosie's life...

and change it forever! 
 
THE MOTHER & DAUGHTER CREATORS
 

As the mother/ daughter, artist & writer team and founders of Pink Party Dress Productions, the Birthday Triplets have been our passion. It's been a project of many years, combining our talents and hearts so that Cookie, Candi and Coco become an inspiring force for the world.  
 
The combination of Lynn's commercial background as an American Greetings artist and member of their think tank, combined with my years as a Montessori teacher and creative writing instructor, made The Birthday Triplets what they are today. 
 
FROM AMERICAN GREETINGS TO MONTESSORI
Creators: Lynn Tooman-Cser and Kelly Tooman 

 


 


WHAT YOUR GENEROSITY WILL DO!
We are seeking funding for continuation of the Birthday Triplets picture book series and an animation short. It's time to launch Candi, Cookie and Coco on a larger scale to reach children all over the world! 
1. Picture Book Series 

The second book in the series, The Birthday Triplets and The Great Pony Race Adventure, is 60 % finished. Funds are needed for graphic designers, consultants, printing, publicists, legal and promotion. We are expecting to have the final book printed by April 2020. Up to the first $10,000 of our funding will go to the book and related expenses.

The third book in the series is nearing 30% completion



 



2. Animation Short 
(See Video, From Bach to Ballet)

In order to market the Birthday Triplets to producers and networks, we need an animation short.  
A TV production quality short animation can cost $60,000-$80,000 and up. Costs include: screenwriters, educational consultants, show bible, storyboarding, casting, recording, music, effects and more.  And this is just pre-production!

3. We Also Need...

Updated interactive Birthday Triplets website with games 
App
Travel expenses and marketing materials for trade shows
Licensing style guide 
Agent fees
Prototypes

Challenges
To the best of our resources and abilities, we introduced Candi, Cookie and Coco Birthday to the world through their first picture book, and grew their social media following to 19,000 on Facebook. With just the two of us, we built websites, designed ads, marketed, produced videos and the list goes on. Our goal is to hire additional talent so the creators can focus on creating.  We cannot do this without YOU! 
 
GREAT VIDEOS!
 
""Rescue, Reading and Being REALLY Brave""
The triplets inspire a love of reading, libraries and creative writing, compassion for animals, and encourage children to be resilient and kind.  But wait!  Candi, Cookie and Coco want to tell you themselves. 
 

 

 

""From Animation to Ballet to Bach""
The Birthday Triplets are advocates for classical music and ballet. 

Amid the whispers of the demise of classical ballet, the dancing Birthday Triplets will be sure to say, ""No, thank you!"" You see, magical triplets, Cookie, Candi, and Coco, have spent their lives being groomed for stardom-to become a ballet and classical music phenomenon in our mainstream culture. As the triplets dance into their inventor Granny's magical adventures, children worldwide will fall in love with The Birthday Triplets-and with ballet too. 


 

""Where, Oh Where Did the Music Go?"" 
""That children make beautiful music is less significant than the fact that music can make beautiful children."" Cheryl Lavender
As budgets are cut for art and music, we head into a culture without grace and civility. However, there's hope on the horizon. The classical world has begun to evolve with the introduction of innovative classical music experiences through outreach programs, audience interaction, You Tube, iTunes, and unique teaching programs such as Cultural Art Strings, as seen in the video below. 

 



 

 


""Gratitude and Prayer""
The Birthday Triplets' stories are secular. Their bedtime prayer, A Thanksgiving Poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson, focuses on being grateful for life's gifts. 

""When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around."" Willie Nelson

Could This Be YOU in Book 2? 
 
 
Risks
The risks are LOW: 

As a former American Greetings artist, Lynn created one of the most financially successful card lines, per card, in the history of the company.  Her commercial background gave Lynn the foundation to design successful mass market characters. 
The Birthday Triplets have an extensive licensing presentation from a toy line to an amusement park concept. A producer called it, ""A Harry Potter for Preschool."" 
We are an independent publisher and are experienced with producing a children's book from idea to completion. 
Our t-shirt line, The Hysterical Historical T-Shirt Company, has been featured in catalogs and can found on our online store: www.funnyhistoricalshirts.com 
Our Ebay rating is 1136 with 100% positive reviews

<h3>Logosophia Books Looks to ReSet at the Next Level</h3>
<p>Steve and Krys Crimi began Logosophia Books in 2007 at our biodynamic farm, Philosophy farm in the mountains of Western North Carolina. Steve's background is in literature, Krys' in horticultural therapy, and both study and practice Eastern and Western philosophy. Our first book was a collection of transcribed talks by Alan Chadwick, who in our opinion is the person mainly responsible for bringing biodynamics to the United States. We published books at a rate of one or two a year, focusing not only on writing of a spiritual and practical nature, but also keeping absurdly highstandards of quality and beauty. In 2011 Logosophia incorporated as we moved off the farm into the city of Asheville. Many of our books are by local authors, and we get to draw on local talented artists for our covers. </p>
<p>Our work in publishing the 7 volume <i>Collected Works of Fitz Hugh Ludlow--</i>a major landmark in American letters in bringing this forgotten master's writings to the public--has us confident to take Logosophia to the next level in 2020. Our goal is an $8000 springboard to:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;redo, update and modernize our antiquated website ($3500)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;hire the help we need to produce, design, print and market the three wondrous books we are already planning for 2020, withe more in the wings we are excited about ($4500)</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;our ultimate dream is to have enough books to sustain full-time staff, so that there are no limitations on our abilitiy to bring to you the brightest writers in fiction, non-fiction and poetry. That realization depends on the success of this indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;every penny Logosophia earns goes to our 50-50 sharing of profit with our authors, and the rest back into keeping the publishing going. Neither Steve nor Krys has ever drawn a salary from Logosophia. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;if we do not reach our goal, whatever funds there are go to a website, this is our most pressing need.</p>

<h3>The Backstory</h3>
<p><strong>In</strong> <strong>September 2020, war broke out in Artsakh</strong>. As a result, thousands of Armenians who have lived in Artsakh for generations are now displaced, starting over in Armenia with what they could carry in their cars and on their packs. Many have also lost loved ones on the frontlines, but the struggles are far from over.</p>
<p>This is a region we had come to know through our travels while writing <i><strong><a href=""https://www.lavashthebook.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lavash</a></strong></i>, a book about the food and people of Armenia. <strong>From 2015 to 2018, we traveled in Artsakh multiple times </strong>while researching our cookbook. While there, <strong>we learned about the local food traditions and became more familiar with the region's deep history</strong>. When the war hit in September, we were not only devastated but also took time to relive some of our memories from our travels. This included everything from eating khorovats with gregarious bed-and-breakfast hosts to learning about the intricacies of jingalov hats, which became our hands-down favorite greens-filled flatbread. </p>
<p>It breaks our hearts that in addition to leaving their homes, Armenians in Artsakh are also walking away from centuries of history and culture. Some buildings and historic heritage sites are now lost for good. This is why we are publishing ARTSAKH, a rich, full-color oversized publication commemorating what we saw while traveling in the region. We want to create a time capsule of the place before the war.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to make sure that the happier memories of Artsakh aren't gone forever. Protecting culture in the face of war is a daunting task, but it's important to keep heritage alive and offer support to the newly displaced, who are starting over in Armenia.</p>

Working with an Armenian-family-owned printer based in Los Angeles will help us get this into your hands quicker and funds to Armenia faster.
We are an experienced editorial and design team, so we understand the logistics of designing, editing, and producing a captivating book.
Our biggest challenge is raising funds quickly so we can raise awareness and send our donation to Armenia Fund to help rebuild as soon as possible.

<h3>My daily inspiration and my larger mission</h3>
<p>This big-hearted boy below had a penchant for wearing skirts and dresses last year... and he still rocks the color pink. In the Victorian Era, all young boys wore dresses (and often had long hair) and in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries pink was considered the most suitable color for boys (while blue, of course, was for girls). I bring this up to put into perspective the sheer randomness of our society's ""rules"". </p>
<p><strong>I desperately want to shine a light on the arbitrary, to normalize the abnormal, and to do my part to increase the declining levels of empathy in our world.</strong> This book is about being true to oneself, despite societal pressures that dictate how one ""should"" behave or what (or even whom!) one ""should"" like.</p>
<p>As such, a portion of the profits from each book will be donated to an amazing LGBTQ charity that helps create safe-spaces for kids of all gender expressions in as many schools as possible.</p>

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>Coming Full Circle is a book about the use of business, as a force for good, in spearheading environmental sustainability in the daily lives of individuals. Specifically, it explores principles that entrepreneurs can harness to harmonize their business with the circular economic movement and zero-waste ideology.<br/><br/>My name is Alexa Smith, and I am the author of Coming Full Circle. I wrote this book because in the midst of the pandemic, I had a lot of time to reflect on my daily habits and the environmental consequences accompanying them. As I watched my trash bin filling up day by day, I became frustrated by my own consumerism, and sought a way to decrease my environmental impact.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the potential of social entrepreneurship, and how the corporate world can be a driver of positive change, rather than a parasitic drain on sustainability. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for zero-waste. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become more conscious of your daily consumption habits and the waste that comes from them: from how they’re designed to how they’re disposed of.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about entrepreneurship and environmentalism. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>Kresse Wesling’s journey turning used firehoses into designer bags</li>
<li>Orange Fiber's mission of making luxury fabric from orange peels</li>
<li>Chef Matt Stone's zero-waste culinary creations</li>
</ul> You will love this book if you are concerned about the current state of our planet and consumption habits. If you need a pick-me-up to keep you from spiraling into dismay about future affairs, these stories will give you hope surrounding the incredible innovations in sustainability going on all around us. If you are looking to enter the workforce in a career with purpose and meaning, reading about the CEOs, economists and activists highlighted in my book, can be incredible pools of inspiration from a variety of fields.<br/><br/>Coming Full Circle is a nonfiction book that speaks to environmentalists and entrepreneurs who want to look at sustainability and business in a new way.<p> </p>
<h3>More Book Details</h3>
<p>This book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters (tentatively titled) Tipping the Scales, Fixing the System and Consumer Barriers. In this section, I lay out statistics and stories of the trash pandemic for you to absorb and ponder, specifically in food, fashion, and single-use plastic industries. Not only do I describe the problem environmentally, but I explain the individual barriers in creating change, and implementing sustainability, despite the increasing activism around it. As an environmentalist, attempting to change the habits of my own family proved to be a challenge. The hurdles synthesized from my own experiences trying to educate them, are woven into the principles I discuss throughout the book.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters divided by design, investment, and connection in crafting a successful business in the circular economy. I investigate successful assets of engineering and creativity as sources of circularity. I then turn to the importance of forming and maintaining a personal connection with waste, by engaging in your community, experiencing the enormity of waste firsthand, and embracing emotional attachment. Lastly, I explore the power of connection in making the circular economy a viable mission, through the use of virtual platforms and existing trends to drive this movement forward.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters Unlocking Wasted Assets and Coming Full Circle. In these culminating chapters, I tie the knot between circularity in the corporate sector, with zero-waste practices at the individual level. By embracing these two immensely important transitions in tandem, a world without waste is not only achievable but inevitable.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Alexa Smith is an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois in environmental science and sustainability. She is heavily involved in all things environmentalism on her Top 10 Campus. She was fundamental in crafting the 2020 Illinois Climate Action Plan, a net-zero carbon commitment by the university. Alexa is also involved in several community-focused student organizations, including ProjectforLess, a group battling food waste and food insecurity in Champaign-Urbana.<br/><br/>Alexa recently joined international social entrepreneurship organization, Enactus, where she has put her “business as a force for good” mantra into action through a portfolio of waste-reducing projects that simultaneously empower disadvantaged, marginalized populations in the community. As a passionate and high-achieving student, Alexa has transformed her informed and emotional relationship with the environment outside of the classroom, into a ripe community to create visible change.<br/><br/>Alexa wrote this book as an exploratory opportunity to verse herself into the professional realm of sustainable business. She wanted to push her limits of environmentalism beyond scientific research into the real-world economy. After hearing an Earth Day feature on zero-waste activist Lauren Singer, Alexa became invested in the circular economy as a way to achieve zero-waste. She hopes through her book to spread her passion on this subject, and connect with consumers on their own relationships with the things they throw away.<br/><br/>Alexa is also an avid traveler, and while she has had the privilege of visiting nine countries, she would love to expand her life and career to new, unexplored territory.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Alexa Smith at alexacs3@illinois.edu and at IG: @alexa.c.smitty and LinkedIn: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/alexacsmith"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.linkedin.com/in/alexacsmith</a></p>

Alexa is also involved in several community-focused student organizations, including ProjectforLess, a group battling food waste and food insecurity in Champaign-Urbana.Alexa recently joined international social entrepreneurship organization, Enactus, where she has put her “business as a force for good” mantra into action through a portfolio of waste-reducing projects that simultaneously empower disadvantaged, marginalized populations in the community. As a passionate and high-achieving student, Alexa has transformed her informed and emotional relationship with the environment outside of the classroom, into a ripe community to create visible change.Alexa wrote this book as an exploratory opportunity to verse herself into the professional realm of sustainable business. She wanted to push her limits of environmentalism beyond scientific research into the real-world economy. After hearing an Earth Day feature on zero-waste activist Lauren Singer, Alexa became invested in the circular economy as a way to achieve zero-waste. She hopes through her book to spread her passion on this subject, and connect with consumers on their own relationships with the things they throw away.Alexa is also an avid traveler, and while she has had the privilege of visiting nine countries, she would love to expand her life and career to new, unexplored territory.For more information, you can connect with Alexa Smith at alexacs3@illinois.edu and at IG: @alexa.c.smitty and LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/alexacsmith
 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Becoming An Empowered Patient </i>is an exploration of how the business of medicine has left little room for access to alternative treatments that are backed by science and as effective as surgeries, prescription medications, and vaccines.<br/><br/>My name is Peggy Coppola and I am the author of <i>Becoming An Empowered Patient</i>. As I was trying to heal from my own health crisis, I came to the realization that conventional medicine was not prepared to treat me in a holistic and comprehensive manner. My goal for this book is to share <strong>evidence-based and effective treatments,</strong> without the potential downsides of many medically prescribed protocols.<br/><br/>In reading this book, I hope you will discover that your health and wellness is in your control, more than you are led to believe. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the exploration of scientifically backed solutions that can heal the body and reverse disease.  Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you become your own empowered and knowledgeable consumer of healthcare, by putting into practice principles of self care, doing your own research, questioning the status quo, seeking multiple opinions, and most importantly, trusting your intuition.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn that, to promote healing, the interconnected body, mind and spirit all need to be addressed.  You'll read about regenerative and energetic healing modalities that many medical doctors are not currently using. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Brooke Goldner’s ability to eradicate her autoimmune diseases and eliminate all medications by using food, the ultimate medicine.  She has been disease free for years and has been treating many others overcome their own autoimmune illnesses.</li>
<li>Dr. Joe Dispenza’s (dare I say miraculous?) healing from a severe spine injury when he was told by multiple doctors that his only option was a radical surgery.  He continues his research in neuroscience, epigenetics and quantum physics to explore the science behind spontaneous remissions.</li>
<li>Dr. Norman Doidge’s work on neuroplasticity provides evidence that even the human brain can heal.  He highlights light energy as a source of regeneration for the human brain and body.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open to the idea that healing happens with self-directed, natural, and less invasive methods (integrative, regenerative medicine)</li>
<li>Interested in what the research points to as the future of medicine and healing </li>
<li>Want to be armed with your own findings when interacting with the medical community about your own health.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/><i>Becoming An Empowered Patient</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to individuals and practitioners who want to look at health and medicine in a new way.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>The Book - Becoming An Empowered Patient</strong><br/><br/>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction along with a history of medicine and the events that led to a fairly narrow view of what is now considered acceptable medical practices. You will read about how ancient and well established health knowledge was sidelined during the 20th century by powerful forces with a financial agenda. You will come to understand why it is imperative to become health empowered.<br/><br/>In <strong>Part 2</strong>,  I share my personal journey, as well as those of others who were forced to become empowered in order to reclaim their health. Here you will learn why nutrition and functional medicine can provide a comprehensive basis for much of our health challenges.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 </strong>is an exploration into well-established alternative health protocols, and the evidence that solidifies their place as legitimate medical treatments. We dive into emerging science and treatments that will define the future of medicine.<br/><br/> </p>

<p>Campaign Overview</p>
<p>""In my first year post-college graduation, I worked as a medical scribe for a primary care physician. Becoming her shadow in the corner of her appointments, I was the silent observer, keeping her notes.</p>
<p>Unlike most human relationships, the patient-doctor relationship is marked by an innate sense of trust on the part of the patient. I watched this trust manifest daily from my corner, as people stripped down to their underwear without thinking twice and revealed the details of their personal lives with even less hesitation.</p>
<p>In day-to-day interactions, the question of “how are you” returns mostly generic responses. Under the care of a physician, however, people seemed to respond without the same reservation, opening up their lives for our examination.</p>
<p>We were told the plot lines of dreams, the sensation of first loves. Frustrated parents recounted arguments with rebellious teenagers; rebellious teenagers recounted arguments with frustrating parents. Young women described their weddings and new fathers their child’s day of birth. </p>
<p>Welcomed into peoples’ vulnerabilities, however, the most consistent experience presented in some form was that of pain. We watched it plague old people, young people. We watched it plague parents, uncles, spouses.</p>
<p>We saw the happy, healthy elderly, women who looked 50 in their 90’s. But we also saw those whom in their 30’s had multiple comorbidities, and though it was unspoken, the doctor and I would exchange glances: we knew they would not survive the next few decades. </p>
<p>Once, we discovered the bulge of a growing tumor beneath a woman’s skin. In the silence, we watched as her little daughter grasped her hand.  </p>
<p>I sat quietly in the corner and captured people's pain with my words, using phrases like ""patient presents with Grief Reaction.” I turned their weeping into terms like ""hypertension"" for high blood pressure, and “CA” for cancer, recorded into the medical system like answers to logical questions."" </p>
<p>(-Excerpt from my introduction.  To read the rest, please consider supporting my campaign :))</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>This book is for you: for the scientist, entrepreneur, dreamer, or anyone interested in understanding how to use science to impact people's lives in a practical way. It's for people who have been impacted by diseases that have no cures and want to do something.</p>
<p> ----</p>
<p>Story of My Book</p>
<p>Creating New Medicines: strategies for building the next biotech start-up is about a new model for helping future biotech innovators think strategically and successfully turn scientific concepts into patient-impacting new medicines. </p>
<p>I wrote this book because I was deeply impacted by seeing the number of patients that ran out of medical options. People deserve and need more medicines and medical options, but this requires more people willing to take the risk of starting or building companies that will pursue this. In my experience, young scientists are often interested in applying their skills to help real people, but aren't sure how to start. This book is meant to show you how.<br/><br/>Experience is crucial in science. This is undeniable. But it's also not everything, and there are ways for young scientists to add value to new companies when they can combine having a teachable attitude with openness to straying off the traditional academic career path.</p>
<p>In the book, I will also cover case studies of famous scientific innovations with original interviews:</p>
<p>The stories of blockbuster drugs Tysabri and Remicade, from experienced entrepreneur and angel investor Dr. Martin Sanders</p>
<p>Creating medicines with a patient-centered view, with John Crowley's personal story (fun fact, his life story was turned into a Harrison Ford movie, called Extraordinary Measures)</p>
<p>The Gleevec Story - themes for translating basic science and an interview with the clinician who ran the pivotal clinical trials, Dr. Brian Druker </p>
<p>Insights on the biotech industry and investing from Keith Crandell, Managing Director and Co-founder of ARCH Venture Partners</p>
<p>How to bootstrap a biotech start-up creatively with an interview with Jake Glanville, who was featured in Gimlet Media's Start-Up podcast </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What You'll Get</p>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July, 2020</p>

</div></div>","Campaign Overview
""In my first year post-college graduation, I worked as a medical scribe for a primary care physician. Becoming her shadow in the corner of her appointments, I was the silent observer, keeping her notes.
Unlike most human relationships, the patient-doctor relationship is marked by an innate sense of trust on the part of the patient. I watched this trust manifest daily from my corner, as people stripped down to their underwear without thinking twice and revealed the details of their personal lives with even less hesitation.
In day-to-day interactions, the question of “how are you” returns mostly generic responses. Under the care of a physician, however, people seemed to respond without the same reservation, opening up their lives for our examination.
We were told the plot lines of dreams, the sensation of first loves. Frustrated parents recounted arguments with rebellious teenagers; rebellious teenagers recounted arguments with frustrating parents. Young women described their weddings and new fathers their child’s day of birth. 
Welcomed into peoples’ vulnerabilities, however, the most consistent experience presented in some form was that of pain. We watched it plague old people, young people. We watched it plague parents, uncles, spouses.
We saw the happy, healthy elderly, women who looked 50 in their 90’s. But we also saw those whom in their 30’s had multiple comorbidities, and though it was unspoken, the doctor and I would exchange glances: we knew they would not survive the next few decades. 
Once, we discovered the bulge of a growing tumor beneath a woman’s skin. In the silence, we watched as her little daughter grasped her hand.  
I sat quietly in the corner and captured people's pain with my words, using phrases like ""patient presents with Grief Reaction.” I turned their weeping into terms like ""hypertension"" for high blood pressure, and “CA” for cancer, recorded into the medical system like answers to logical questions."" 
(-Excerpt from my introduction.  To read the rest, please consider supporting my campaign :))

This book is for you: for the scientist, entrepreneur, dreamer, or anyone interested in understanding how to use science to impact people's lives in a practical way. It's for people who have been impacted by diseases that have no cures and want to do something.

Story of My Book
Creating New Medicines: strategies for building the next biotech start-up is about a new model for helping future biotech innovators think strategically and successfully turn scientific concepts into patient-impacting new medicines. 
I wrote this book because I was deeply impacted by seeing the number of patients that ran out of medical options. People deserve and need more medicines and medical options, but this requires more people willing to take the risk of starting or building companies that will pursue this. In my experience, young scientists are often interested in applying their skills to help real people, but aren't sure how to start. This book is meant to show you how.Experience is crucial in science. This is undeniable. But it's also not everything, and there are ways for young scientists to add value to new companies when they can combine having a teachable attitude with openness to straying off the traditional academic career path.
In the book, I will also cover case studies of famous scientific innovations with original interviews:
The stories of blockbuster drugs Tysabri and Remicade, from experienced entrepreneur and angel investor Dr. Martin Sanders
Creating medicines with a patient-centered view, with John Crowley's personal story (fun fact, his life story was turned into a Harrison Ford movie, called Extraordinary Measures)
The Gleevec Story - themes for translating basic science and an interview with the clinician who ran the pivotal clinical trials, Dr. Brian Druker 
Insights on the biotech industry and investing from Keith Crandell, Managing Director and Co-founder of ARCH Venture Partners
How to bootstrap a biotech start-up creatively with an interview with Jake Glanville, who was featured in Gimlet Media's Start-Up podcast

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.
