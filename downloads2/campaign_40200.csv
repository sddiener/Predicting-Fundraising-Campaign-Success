<h3>                         What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $100,000 more to take the company public. We have engaged a company that is primed to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>We are offering those investing:</p>
<p>$1-$2,500 earns 1 share/dollar</p>
<p>$2,501-$5,000 earns 2 shares/dollar</p>
<p>$5,001 -$10,000 earns 3 shares/dollar</p>
<p>$10,001+ earns 3 shares/dollar and a seat on our board of directors</p>
<p>We are excited about how far we've come! Now you can be one of those contributors who is directly responsiple for leaving the world better off than when they've received it! IMAGINE THAT! </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>                                       The Impact</h3>
<p>Just imagine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of acres of land being used by landfills toxifying our land and our water.</li>
<li>The invisible pollutants that we inhale from the emissions of the other  plants that are active.</li>
<li>The pollutants from our environment causing the increase in various debilitating &amp; life threatening health conditions directly related to toxicity.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of which will be positively impacted by our proposed solution! </p>
<p>We boast a rate of 2-5% waste that is observed from our process. NO air pollution. NO ground Contamination. The plant is self reliant providing our own water, heat and electricity to operate. <span>Our proprietary design will recycle all forms of trash and turn it into a reusable energy; such as electricity, bio-fuels, ink by-products, asphalt and charcoal briquettes.</span></p>
<p><span>Another hot topic in the world that we will impact is JOBS! We have the ability to create about 100 new jobs at our facility.

GOOD2GO is a company of like-minded individuals, based on St. Maarten in the north east Caribbean and the only specialist supplier
of sustainable packaging and disposable tableware in the region.  What unites this small, energetic team is a heartfelt
commitment to ridding the islands of single-use plastic products and replacing
them with innovative and practical alternatives; products made from corn, sugar
cane, bamboo and palm leaves, all of which break down in our natural
environment.
 
The people at GOOD2GO, like many others in the region,
are thoroughly sick of seeing the shameful tide of plastic that is sweeping
through their beautiful islands, ruining the oceans and beaches and killing
wildlife.  GOOD2GO believes that the harmful effects
of plastic pollution in the environment cannot be overstated and they are
determined to rid the Caribbean of throw-away plastic products; from packaging,
food containers and beverage bottles, through to bags, cups, plates, trays and
cutlery. 

 
Thankfully, many
enlightened  businesses, and some government
departments, are working with GOOD2GO to move away from ‘nasty plastic’.   It’s
comforting to know that in this plastic-filled world, people everywhere are
turning to biodegradable alternatives and becoming more aware of how an
individual’s action, no matter how small, really can make a contribution to the
environment. 




GOOD2GO disposables come from nature and go
back to nature: 
Disposables
should be disposable, right?  At GOOD2GO we believe that it’s insane to make a single-use item from a material
that lasts for hundreds or even thousands of years.  But that is exactly the situation with
petrochemical plastics.  GOOD2GO products are made from plants, like corn, sugar cane waste or fallen
leaves, and go back to nature after they are disposed of.  They are truly disposable.   From trash bags to a wide variety of food and
beverage containers, GOOD2GO supplies
them all.
 
GOOD2GO needs a delivery truck: 

Our poor little old car just couldn’t take the pressure.  Despite our efforts to keep it on the road
and having poured far too much money into keeping it going, it finally gave up
the ghost one Saturday morning in late June. 
A very dear friend and supporter of GOOD2GO offered us his pick-up truck but
we need the funds to buy it.  It’s in
great condition and is perfect for our needs. 
If we don’t reach our target we’ll still buy the truck but it will take
us longer.  If we receive more than our
target we’ll put the money towards the purchase of a hard top for the pick-up
to protect our wonderful products from the harsh tropical sun and regular
tropical downpours.   Some of the funds raised will pay to have the pick-up
adorned with the GOOD2GO logo
and other information (like your name if you pledge more than $100) so more
people get to know about GOOD2GO.
 
Other ways you can help GOOD2GO to reach our
target:

<h3>The Green Events Program: Spreading Sustainability</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I'm Tomas, a Grade 10 student in Burnaby, BC, and I created the Green Events Program to spread the practice of ""Reduce before recycle.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My roots in sustainability were planted when I was a small child, but my passion started just two years ago. Since then, I have been immersing myself in the world of environmental justice. I wanted to share with my peers what I believe deep down: that we cannot keep tossing everything into landfills for the sake of convenience. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">On my own, I set out to educate the people around me in responsible waste management.

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>A $40 donation will pay for 12 sets of plates, forks and knives at retail price, and put $2 towards our field trip and a daylong workshop for new Green Events Program ambassadors. <br/>
</li>
<li>A $25 donation will pay for 7 sets and put $2.50 towards our field trip and our workshop for new Green Events Program ambassadors.<br/>

</li>
<li>how to measure impact of the program<br/>
</li>
<li>how to spread adoption of Reduce before Recycle<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If we raise 50% of our goal, we will qualify for matching funds from Ashoka Canada (up to $2,500). That means if we raise the full $5,000 through this campaign, we could have a total of $7,500 to work with, allowing us to fund 10 schools instead of 7.<br/></p>

The Green Events Program: Spreading Sustainability
I'm Tomas, a Grade 10 student in Burnaby, BC, and I created the Green Events Program to spread the practice of ""Reduce before recycle.""
My roots in sustainability were planted when I was a small child, but my passion started just two years ago. Since then, I have been immersing myself in the world of environmental justice. I wanted to share with my peers what I believe deep down: that we cannot keep tossing everything into landfills for the sake of convenience. 
On my own, I set out to educate the people around me in responsible waste management. For those as passionate as me, I want to make it easier for them to take the lead. And so, with the Green Events Program, I begin my journey to help others take care of our earth. I’m very excited to now have Jacqueline, the Chair of the Burnaby Youth Sustainability Network, on the team!
The Green Events Program is designed so that students reduce waste at their school events by putting in place a simple waste management system and a reusable event materials library. The library is an inventory of materials (dinnerware, utensils, decorations, etc.) that are frequently used at school functions (banquets, breakfasts, club meetings, etc.).
Here's a look at how the program works at one of our school events:

Since the program's launch at my school, Alpha Secondary, we've seen more than 2500 uses of knives, forks and plates. We now want to empower more youth leaders at other schools and spread the program across the region and beyond... with your help!


What We Need

We need $5000 dollars in order to expand to seven more schools at just over $700 per set of 250 plates, forks, and knives (at retail price). We also plan to look to hotels and restaurants to donate their old inventory.


A $40 donation will pay for 12 sets of plates, forks and knives at retail price, and put $2 towards our field trip and a daylong workshop for new Green Events Program ambassadors. 

A $25 donation will pay for 7 sets and put $2.50 towards our field trip and our workshop for new Green Events Program ambassadors.



Giving schools a library to work with helps speed up the change we want to see. If we don't provide an initial set of plates and utensils, students at each school would have to spend some time fundraising, delaying the adoption of the program.
The funds will also help us take student leaders on a field trip to the Vancouver Landfill and a composting facility to see where all our waste ends up.
We will also hold a daylong workshop to train students some essential skills:


how to do a waste audit of school events

how to measure impact of the program

how to spread adoption of Reduce before Recycle



If we raise 50% of our goal, we will qualify for matching funds from Ashoka Canada (up to $2,500). That means if we raise the full $5,000 through this campaign, we could have a total of $7,500 to work with, allowing us to fund 10 schools instead of 7.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Help break the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation by educating the indigenous Mayan children of Comalapa, Guatemala.</span></h3>
<div> </div>
<div>I am writing this just a few weeks after the completion of the construction of a sustainable home for an indigenous Mayan family in Comalapa, Guatemala. A total of 96 people, including members of the <a href=""http://earthship.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Earthship Biotecture</a> Crew, <a href=""http://lwhome.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Long Way Home</a> Team, local Guatemalans, and 65 volunteers from countries including Austraila, New Zealand, Brazil, Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, England, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, South Africa, Mexico, Canada, and the United States, worked together in unison to build a 'Simple Survival Pod' Earthship for Long Way Home's Guatemalan Foreman, Romeo Apen and his family. In three weeks time, the home was complete and ready for its finishing touches so that Apens could move into their new home. Not only will Romeo's home collect and filter its own rainwater and run on solar energy, it will also use and reuse water a total of four times, which is used to grow food in an indoor greenhouse.</div>
<div> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""BBBB"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a640/Justin_Lee_Henson/d7752844-4923-4c86-8222-52c8143657ec_zpsaad7c4fb.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""BBBB""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The experience can only be described with words such as ""amazing"", ""incredible"", ""magical"", and ""heart-warming,"" and the project clearly demonstrated the power that is possible when people come together for a unifying cause. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>All of this began by a small group of individuals working together with <a href=""http://earthship.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Earthship Biotecture</a> and <a href=""http://lwhome.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Long Way Home</a> to help raise donations for a worthy and charitable cause: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BottleBuildingsAndBambooBicyclesInGuatemala"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bottle Buildings and Bamboo Bicycles in Guatemala</a>. Through this campaign with <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/usingwaterwisely"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">indiegogo </a>, a total of $4,200USD was raised in one month to help secure the necessary funds to complete the construction of the home for Romeo and his family. The support and interest we received for this campaign from family, friends, and many other interested parties, was nothing short of awe-inspiring.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><em><strong>Today, the cause continues with The Long Way Home and the children of Guatemala...</strong></em></h3>
<div> </div>
<div style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt=""Los Ninos"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a640/Justin_Lee_Henson/44f4a139-1d33-4135-bc2c-c11e34b10d88_zps25feafaf.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Los Ninos""/></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After spending three weeks in Comalapa, I began to realize how the work Long Way Home does is vitally important to Compala, Guatemala. Long Way Home Team are addressing very real issues that not only affect Guatemala and other Latin America countries, but countries around the world, there is an over-abundance of waste and trash that goes completely unchecked. This later ends up in our streets, gardens, playgrounds or, even worse, our lakes, streams, and groundwater where many people in countries like Guatemala get their drinking water.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The problem is compounded in places like Guatemala where there is almost no infrastructure for recycling or even basic waste disposal. Most of the garbage goes directly into the street or, as previously mentioned, into a lake or stream. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So what do we do about what seems to be an ever-increasing problem with no end? </div>
<p>Although there are no perfect solutions at the moment, Long Way Home Team are making serious head way on some of the problems that not only affect Guatemalans, but affect us all.  </p>
<p>Thus far, Long Way Home has collected and used 262 tons of garbage for building projects in Comalapa, Guatemala. Their primary project is a sustainable school which, in addition to the standard curriculum, currently teaches 46 indigenous children Kaqchikel (the traditional local Mayan dialect), traditional Mayan culture, English and environmental stewardship. The school will teach 350 students when the school is complete. </p>
<p>Additionally, they have paid upwards of $110,000USD in salary to local Guatemalan workers employed for sustainable projects in Comalapa. These community members are being trained to build sustainable homes and they can use these skills to start their own alternative building business. </p>
<p>Because of my great admiration for what the Long Way Home is doing, I have decided to stay in Comalapa and do what I can to help. </p>
<p> </p>

<h2><strong>Who is The Long Way Home?</strong></h2>
<div>Long Way Home was founded in 2004 when Mateo Paneitz finished his Peace Corps service and realized his work in the small town of San Juan Comalapa, Guatemala was not done. He brought together a group of dedicated activists who were interested in helping this community change their future. Mateo’s goal was to address two primary issues: the lack of appropriate waste management strategies; and the lack of educational and employment opportunities for local, indigenous youth. His team came up with a unique solution that would tackle both issues simultaneously: build a primary and vocational facility out of waste materials!</div>
<h2 align=""justify""><strong>Background</strong></h2>

<h2>The Impact</h2>

<p>The Vocational School will provide a venue for young Comalapans to learn such trades as masonry, carpentry and bicycle repair. The workshops in the school will serve as hands-on classrooms, and will be viable businesses where the students will work as apprentices to professionals in each field. The income generated by the workshops will pay the teachers’ salaries, helping the school near its goal of financial sustainability. The school plans include an area where students can learn alternative energy production. Once the school is successfully producing alternative fuels, the sale of fuel will provide additional funding for the institution.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Interns and volunteers from around the world who come to work at the Técnico Maya Vocational School will also contribute to the financial sustainability of the project. The fee that each volunteer pays will directly fund educational programs at the school and supplement teacher salaries.</p>
<h3 align=""justify"">
<img alt=""bottles"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a640/Justin_Lee_Henson/f08102f9-58b2-4549-a29d-e42d636d6ebf_zps36f0313b.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 10px; float: right;""/>Environmental Contribution</h3>
<p>Using environmentally friendly construction methods such as trash bottles, rammed earth, and earth bag, the school is a practical demonstration of how to reuse discarded materials. The locals who participate in the school’s construction have hands-on experience with these money-saving construction techniques and will hopefully apply their new knowledge within the community.</p>
<p>Environmental education will be a main focus of the school’s new curriculum. From organic permaculture to environmentally friendly construction methods, young Comalapans will be learning responsible stewardship of the Earth through their coursework. The addition of alternative fuel production education should make a long-term impact on the surrounding communities as well.</p>
<h3 align=""justify""><strong><img alt=""Economic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1287.photobucket.com/albums/a640/Justin_Lee_Henson/ee6783e1-3a53-49db-b6f1-8515099e30dd_zps73841730.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 10px; float: left;""/>Economic Contribution</strong></h3>
<p>The most immediate way that the construction of the vocational school will contribute to the economy of Comalapa is through providing jobs for teachers. Not only will the current Técnico Maya teachers have a more consistent source of income, but the newly added vocational curriculum will require the addition of several new teachers from within the community. The long-term economic effects of the vocational school will be felt when a group of skilled young Comalapans, uniquely trained to be environmental entrepreneurs, enter the Guatemalan job market.</p>

<h2>What I and The Long Way Home Need  </h2>
<p><em><strong>For this campaign, all that I am asking for is $1,000USD. </strong></em>A breakdown of funds is below:</p>
<ul>
<li>$300USD goes towards my monthly volunteer and housing fee, which goes directly to Long Home to help pay for their operational costs. </li>
<li>The $200USD will be used for personal food and other everyday miscellaneous necessities. </li>
<li>I am also raising an additional $500USD for Long Way Home, which brings a total of $800USD going towards helping pay for teachers' salaries, school materials for the children, and the sustainable school building project.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What happens if we don't reach our goal? Then what?</h2>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, I will not be able to stay with The Long Way Home, and The Long Way Home will not get the helpful funds they need to continue their mission of educating and employing the youth, promoting community and cooperation through environmental stewardship, and eradicating poverty and pollution in Comalapa, Guatemala.</p>

La mayor parte de la basura va directamente a la calle o, como se ha mencionado anteriormente, en un lago o arroyo.<br/> <br/>Entonces, ¿qué vamos a hacer con lo que parece ser un problema cada vez mayor que no tiene fin?<br/>Aunque no existen soluciones perfectas en este momento, el equipo de Long Way Home está dando paso grave en la cabeza de algunos de los problemas que no sólo afectan a los guatemaltecos, pero nos afectan a todos.</p>
<p>Hasta el momento, Long Way Home ha recogido y utilizado 262 toneladas de basura para la construcción de proyectos en Comalapa, Guatemala. Su proyecto principal es una escuela sostenible que, además del plan de estudios estándar, actualmente imparte 46 niños indígenas kaqchikeles (el dialecto maya tradicional local), de la cultura maya tradicional, inglés y administración ambiental. La escuela enseñará 350 estudiantes cuando la escuela está completa.</p>
<p>Además, se han pagado más de $ 110,000 USD en salarios a los trabajadores guatemaltecos empleados locales para proyectos sostenibles en Comalapa. Estos miembros de la comunidad están siendo entrenados para construir viviendas sostenibles y que pueden utilizar estas habilidades para crear su propia empresa de construcción alternativa.</p>
<p>Debido a mi gran admiración por lo que el largo camino a casa está haciendo, he decidido quedarse en Comalapa y hacer lo que pueda para ayudar.</p>

</div></div>","Help break the cycle of poverty and environmental degradation by educating the indigenous Mayan children of Comalapa, Guatemala.
 
I am writing this just a few weeks after the completion of the construction of a sustainable home for an indigenous Mayan family in Comalapa, Guatemala. A total of 96 people, including members of the Earthship Biotecture Crew, Long Way Home Team, local Guatemalans, and 65 volunteers from countries including Austraila, New Zealand, Brazil, Italy, France, Germany, Denmark, England, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, South Africa, Mexico, Canada, and the United States, worked together in unison to build a 'Simple Survival Pod' Earthship for Long Way Home's Guatemalan Foreman, Romeo Apen and his family. In three weeks time, the home was complete and ready for its finishing touches so that Apens could move into their new home. Not only will Romeo's home collect and filter its own rainwater and run on solar energy, it will also use and reuse water a total of four times, which is used to grow food in an indoor greenhouse.
 

 
The experience can only be described with words such as ""amazing"", ""incredible"", ""magical"", and ""heart-warming,"" and the project clearly demonstrated the power that is possible when people come together for a unifying cause. 
 
All of this began by a small group of individuals working together with Earthship Biotecture and Long Way Home to help raise donations for a worthy and charitable cause: Bottle Buildings and Bamboo Bicycles in Guatemala. Through this campaign with indiegogo , a total of $4,200USD was raised in one month to help secure the necessary funds to complete the construction of the home for Romeo and his family. The support and interest we received for this campaign from family, friends, and many other interested parties, was nothing short of awe-inspiring.
 
Today, the cause continues with The Long Way Home and the children of Guatemala...
 

 
 
After spending three weeks in Comalapa, I began to realize how the work Long Way Home does is vitally important to Compala, Guatemala. Long Way Home Team are addressing very real issues that not only affect Guatemala and other Latin America countries, but countries around the world, there is an over-abundance of waste and trash that goes completely unchecked. This later ends up in our streets, gardens, playgrounds or, even worse, our lakes, streams, and groundwater where many people in countries like Guatemala get their drinking water.
 
The problem is compounded in places like Guatemala where there is almost no infrastructure for recycling or even basic waste disposal. Most of the garbage goes directly into the street or, as previously mentioned, into a lake or stream. 
 
So what do we do about what seems to be an ever-increasing problem with no end? 
Although there are no perfect solutions at the moment, Long Way Home Team are making serious head way on some of the problems that not only affect Guatemalans, but affect us all.  
Thus far, Long Way Home has collected and used 262 tons of garbage for building projects in Comalapa, Guatemala. Their primary project is a sustainable school which, in addition to the standard curriculum, currently teaches 46 indigenous children Kaqchikel (the traditional local Mayan dialect), traditional Mayan culture, English and environmental stewardship. The school will teach 350 students when the school is complete. 
Additionally, they have paid upwards of $110,000USD in salary to local Guatemalan workers employed for sustainable projects in Comalapa. These community members are being trained to build sustainable homes and they can use these skills to start their own alternative building business. 
Because of my great admiration for what the Long Way Home is doing, I have decided to stay in Comalapa and do what I can to help. 
 
Now...I need your help! :)
 

Who is The Long Way Home?
Long Way Home was founded in 2004 when Mateo Paneitz finished his Peace Corps service and realized his work in the small town of San Juan Comalapa, Guatemala was not done. He brought together a group of dedicated activists who were interested in helping this community change their future. Mateo’s goal was to address two primary issues: the lack of appropriate waste management strategies; and the lack of educational and employment opportunities for local, indigenous youth. His team came up with a unique solution that would tackle both issues simultaneously: build a primary and vocational facility out of waste materials!
Background
The Técnico Maya school needs funding, and the dedicated staff and faculty at the school have donated time and money to provide a multicultural education at a low cost to students, only charging a nominal fee and providing scholarships for those who cannot afford to pay. All students are required to bring plastic bottles filled with trash each week as part of their ""tuition.""
  


The Impact
Sustainability
The Vocational School will provide a venue for young Comalapans to learn such trades as masonry, carpentry and bicycle repair. The workshops in the school will serve as hands-on classrooms, and will be viable businesses where the students will work as apprentices to professionals in each field. The income generated by the workshops will pay the teachers’ salaries, helping the school near its goal of financial sustainability. The school plans include an area where students can learn alternative energy production. Once the school is successfully producing alternative fuels, the sale of fuel will provide additional funding for the institution.
Interns and volunteers from around the world who come to work at the Técnico Maya Vocational School will also contribute to the financial sustainability of the project. The fee that each volunteer pays will directly fund educational programs at the school and supplement teacher salaries.

Environmental Contribution
Using environmentally friendly construction methods such as trash bottles, rammed earth, and earth bag, the school is a practical demonstration of how to reuse discarded materials. The locals who participate in the school’s construction have hands-on experience with these money-saving construction techniques and will hopefully apply their new knowledge within the community.
Environmental education will be a main focus of the school’s new curriculum. From organic permaculture to environmentally friendly construction methods, young Comalapans will be learning responsible stewardship of the Earth through their coursework. The addition of alternative fuel production education should make a long-term impact on the surrounding communities as well.
Economic Contribution
The most immediate way that the construction of the vocational school will contribute to the economy of Comalapa is through providing jobs for teachers. Not only will the current Técnico Maya teachers have a more consistent source of income, but the newly added vocational curriculum will require the addition of several new teachers from within the community. The long-term economic effects of the vocational school will be felt when a group of skilled young Comalapans, uniquely trained to be environmental entrepreneurs, enter the Guatemalan job market.



What I and The Long Way Home Need  
For this campaign, all that I am asking for is $1,000USD. A breakdown of funds is below:

$300USD goes towards my monthly volunteer and housing fee, which goes directly to Long Home to help pay for their operational costs. 
The $200USD will be used for personal food and other everyday miscellaneous necessities. 
I am also raising an additional $500USD for Long Way Home, which brings a total of $800USD going towards helping pay for teachers' salaries, school materials for the children, and the sustainable school building project.

What happens if we don't reach our goal? Then what?
If we don't reach our goal, I will not be able to stay with The Long Way Home, and The Long Way Home will not get the helpful funds they need to continue their mission of educating and employing the youth, promoting community and cooperation through environmental stewardship, and eradicating poverty and pollution in Comalapa, Guatemala.

Ayuda a romper el ciclo de pobreza y degradación ambiental mediante la educación de los niños indigenous Mayas de Comalapa, Guatemala.
Estoy escribiendo esto tan sólo unas semanas después de la finalización de la construcción de una vivienda sostenible para una familia indígena maya en Comalapa, Guatemala. Un total de 96 personas, incluidos los miembros de la Earthship Biotecture, Long Way Home, Guatemaltecos locales y 65 voluntarios de países como Austraila, Nueva Zelanda, Brasil, Italia, Francia, Alemania, Dinamarca, Inglaterra, Holanda, Noruega, Suecia, Sudáfrica, México, Canadá y Estados Unidos, trabajó junto al unísono para construir un Earthship 'Pod simple Survival ""para Guatemala Capataz Long Way Home, el Apen Romeo y su familia. Dentro de tres semanas, la casa estaba completa y lista para sus toques finales a fin de que Apens podía moverse en su nuevo hogar. No sólo va a casa de Romeo recoger y filtrar el agua de lluvia y su propia funcionar con energía solar, sino que también va a utilizar y reutilizar el agua de un total de cuatro veces, que se utiliza para producir alimentos en un invernadero de interior.
 

 
La experiencia sólo puede ser descrito con palabras como ""increíble"", ""increíble"", ""mágico"" y ""conmovedores"", y el proyecto demuestra claramente el poder que es posible cuando las personas se unen por una causa unificadora. Todo esto comenzó con un pequeño grupo de individuos trabajando juntos con Earthship Biotecture y Long Way Home para ayudar a recaudar donaciones para una causa noble y caritativo: Bottle Buildings and Bamboo Bicycles in Guatemala. A través de esta campaña con indiegogo, un total de $ 4,200 USD se elevó en un mes para ayudar a asegurar los fondos necesarios para completar la construcción de la casa de Romeo y su familia. El apoyo y el interés que hemos recibido para esta campaña de la familia, amigos, y muchas otras partes interesadas, fue nada menos que impresionante.
Hoy en día, la causa continúa con The Long Way Home y los niños de Guatemala ...

<h2><em>Accountability is the keystone of change</em></h2>
<div>If the seriousness of Climate Change is now being acknowledged by most, reversing the trend is not an attainable goal if only dealt with on individual levels. The purpose of Greenplease is to take the Green pulse of communities and establish strong local and global platforms where people can organize active social campaigns to (mindfully but uncomprominsingly) pressure Corporations and City Councils to <strong>take on the challenge of holding up their businesses while making them green. </strong>
</div>
<ul>
<li>The influence <strong>Corporations </strong>have on everyone’s consumer habits, and consequently on the planet, is colossal. Above all, they must become advocates of sustainable living and live up to the trust we put in them when choosing their goods.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>City Councils </strong>are the only gouvernement platforms still operated on a human scale and yet, they’re powerful enough to drive change. It’s where green movements can really be initiated and supported.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Turfs</strong> are interactive hubs for building 2-way communication bridges between city administrations and their citizens, and between corporations and their patrons. <strong>My Turfs</strong> are for individuals, <strong>Big Turfs</strong> for corporations and <strong>City Turfs</strong> for cities.  </p>
<p>Greenplease’s <strong>Tools</strong> are easy to use and fast to put in action. They are about:</p>
<ul>
<li>accountability (<strong>Boycotts</strong>)</li>
<li>support (<strong>Buycotts</strong>)</li>
<li>commitment (<strong>Bans</strong>)</li>
<li>advocacy (<strong>Saturday Greenplease Gatherings</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Turfs &amp; Tools</strong> combination is a unique and powerful opportunity for people to take simple actions that, put together, can lead to incredible feats of leverage and persuasion. <strong>And, despite the numerous “green social networks” on the Web already, nothing of the like is yet available.</strong> With critical environmental issues now globally being among our top priorities, the timing for such a platform is perfect. </p>
<h3><strong>All the architecture, functionalities and user experience are now ready to be web-executed and put online.</strong></h3>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> all the web designs in the video are preliminary mockups. Final designs are still to be created.</em></p>
<h3>A more detailed overview on functionalities and features available <a href=""http://www.greenplease.co/gp2/downloads/greenplease.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here !</a>
</h3>
<h3><em> </em></h3>
<h2><strong><em>With your help we’ll be able to :</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Set up a temporary office</strong> – We are currently all volunteers. To get Greenplease up and running we need to shift from a part-time volunteer status to a full-time workforce for a 3-month period.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Hire additional web-programmers and graphic designers</strong> – All the web designs shown in this Indiegogo video are preliminary mockups. We need to hire professional graphic designers to work on unique designs and icons that will become Greenplease trademarks.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take care of all hosting and maintenance costs for the first 12 months</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>
<strong><strong>PLEASE DO NOT WORRY: </strong></strong><strong><strong>Greenplease is going ahead !</strong></strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>If the campaign doesn't reach its target, we will still continue to work on the execution, and use the funds accordingly. It will just take a little more time ! </strong></p>

Accountability is the keystone of change
If the seriousness of Climate Change is now being acknowledged by most, reversing the trend is not an attainable goal if only dealt with on individual levels. The purpose of Greenplease is to take the Green pulse of communities and establish strong local and global platforms where people can organize active social campaigns to (mindfully but uncomprominsingly) pressure Corporations and City Councils to take on the challenge of holding up their businesses while making them green. 


The influence Corporations have on everyone’s consumer habits, and consequently on the planet, is colossal. Above all, they must become advocates of sustainable living and live up to the trust we put in them when choosing their goods.



City Councils are the only gouvernement platforms still operated on a human scale and yet, they’re powerful enough to drive change. It’s where green movements can really be initiated and supported.

Turfs are interactive hubs for building 2-way communication bridges between city administrations and their citizens, and between corporations and their patrons. My Turfs are for individuals, Big Turfs for corporations and City Turfs for cities.  
Greenplease’s Tools are easy to use and fast to put in action. They are about:

accountability (Boycotts)
support (Buycotts)
commitment (Bans)
advocacy (Saturday Greenplease Gatherings).

The Turfs & Tools combination is a unique and powerful opportunity for people to take simple actions that, put together, can lead to incredible feats of leverage and persuasion. And, despite the numerous “green social networks” on the Web already, nothing of the like is yet available. With critical environmental issues now globally being among our top priorities, the timing for such a platform is perfect. 
All the architecture, functionalities and user experience are now ready to be web-executed and put online.
Note: all the web designs in the video are preliminary mockups. Final designs are still to be created.
A more detailed overview on functionalities and features available here !

 
With your help we’ll be able to :


Set up a temporary office – We are currently all volunteers. To get Greenplease up and running we need to shift from a part-time volunteer status to a full-time workforce for a 3-month period.



Hire additional web-programmers and graphic designers – All the web designs shown in this Indiegogo video are preliminary mockups. We need to hire professional graphic designers to work on unique designs and icons that will become Greenplease trademarks.


Take care of all hosting and maintenance costs for the first 12 months

 

PLEASE DO NOT WORRY: Greenplease is going ahead !

If the campaign doesn't reach its target, we will still continue to work on the execution, and use the funds accordingly. It will just take a little more time ! 
 
The Wearable Perks !

The greatest perk you can offer yourself is the personal satisfaction that comes along when getting involved in a movement set out to make our world a better place !
That being said, we obviously want to underline your involvement in the endeavor with nice wearable perks ! 


1-inch Buttons - Our first batch of 1000 buttons have a special inscription on their rims : “ I’M ONE OF THE FIRST 1000 GREENPLEASERS”. We still have a little over 500 of those left…Don’t miss out !



""Switch on to Green"" Stickers - If you'd like more stickers to spread the word around, please contact us and we'll gladly send you some at cost price !    



""Make it Greenplease"" T-Shirts - The T-shirts you see here were individually hand-pressed for us. On the T-Shirts we’ll make for you we’ll add a short self-explanatory slogan: “Let’s make it Greenplease”. Please claim many, and we'll be able to offer both women's and men's style !



Distinctive Green Turf Headers - Fast-forward yourself 3 years in the future and imagine that Greenplease is ""THE"" green social platform everyone is using. Wouldn't a distinctive green header on your TURF profile be the envy of all your peers ?



Original ""Vintage"" Greenplease T-Shirt - Get your hands on this last original Greenplease T-Shirt, bearing the first logo mockup. Hurry up: there is only one ! Have a look at it !

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><em>Thirdly through our work we aim to build up a community of interest in our project and in our kind of work.

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><em>We have seen rises in our two main festival’s recycling rates from 50% to 80% in the last two years.

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1""><em>This summer we are also hoping to <strong>enhance and build on our international connections</strong>.

<h3><font size=""5"">My Story</font></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3"">I am a student of psychology and fine arts but my passion
lies in permaculture. On a study abroad semester in Israel, I learned about
this concept for the first time. Permaculture is based on three ethics: </font></p>
<font size=""3"" style=""font-family: helvetica;"">
</font><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3""><span style="""">            </span>Care of the
Earth</font></p>
<font size=""3"" style=""font-family: helvetica;"">
</font><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3""><span style="""">            </span>Care of
People</font></p>
<font size=""3"" style=""font-family: helvetica;"">
</font><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3""><span style="""">            </span>Fair Share
(of the earth, goods, and knowledge).</font></p>
<font size=""3"" style=""font-family: helvetica;"">
</font><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3"">After studying permaculture, I returned to school in
Cambridge, MA where I worked for an organization called CitySprouts (<a href=""http://www.citysprouts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.citysprouts.org</a>). It was a wonderful
experience and allowed me to continue working in the dirt with passionate and
earth conscious individuals while living in a large city. Now, I am graduating
from school in Paris, France and am looking towards the future-a future full of
permaculture and its three ethics. I have come up with a goal that will,
hopefully, allow the idea of permaculture to spread to people in cities and
small communities that are looking for a creative and innovative method for
communal and sustainable living. And I need your help to realize this goal! </font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font size=""5"">Goal</font></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;"">2 years of travel to share the story of Permaculture and the
individuals who have created communities around the world to better the planet,
lives and community spirit. I will be keeping a blog as I travel with the hopes
of also publishing stories as a freelance writer in newspapers and permaculture
publications as I move from community to community. At the end, I will be
compiling all of the information I have received into a book. It will focus on
the inception of these five communities, those who founded them, and their commitment
to permaculture. It will include images, interviews, stories, maps, and a great
deal about permaculture. </p>
<br/><h3><font size=""5"">The Impact</font></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3"">This project will provide an understanding of the basis of
permaculture. It is a concept that should be understood throughout the world as
we move towards a healthier (for the earth, for people and for trade)
lifestyle. This concept is known to many small communities across the world but
needs the extra push to bring it to the attention of the world as a whole. I
hope to help permaculture along while also sharing information about the
diverse and wonderful communities that have already adopted its concepts. </font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3"">
</font>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: helvetica;""><font size=""3"">It will also bring to light cultures and communities that
may often be overlooked. From communities in Israel who do not subscribe to
hatred and violence to communities that promote medicinal healing and
shamanistic practices, there are many places in the world that are reviewed

</div></div>","My Story


I am a student of psychology and fine arts but my passion
lies in permaculture. On a study abroad semester in Israel, I learned about
this concept for the first time. Permaculture is based on three ethics: 

            Care of the
Earth

            Care of
People

            Fair Share
(of the earth, goods, and knowledge).

After studying permaculture, I returned to school in
Cambridge, MA where I worked for an organization called CitySprouts (www.citysprouts.org). It was a wonderful
experience and allowed me to continue working in the dirt with passionate and
earth conscious individuals while living in a large city. Now, I am graduating
from school in Paris, France and am looking towards the future-a future full of
permaculture and its three ethics. I have come up with a goal that will,
hopefully, allow the idea of permaculture to spread to people in cities and
small communities that are looking for a creative and innovative method for
communal and sustainable living. And I need your help to realize this goal! 


Goal


2 years of travel to share the story of Permaculture and the
individuals who have created communities around the world to better the planet,
lives and community spirit. I will be keeping a blog as I travel with the hopes
of also publishing stories as a freelance writer in newspapers and permaculture
publications as I move from community to community. At the end, I will be
compiling all of the information I have received into a book. It will focus on
the inception of these five communities, those who founded them, and their commitment
to permaculture. It will include images, interviews, stories, maps, and a great
deal about permaculture. 
The Impact


This project will provide an understanding of the basis of
permaculture. It is a concept that should be understood throughout the world as
we move towards a healthier (for the earth, for people and for trade)
lifestyle. This concept is known to many small communities across the world but
needs the extra push to bring it to the attention of the world as a whole. I
hope to help permaculture along while also sharing information about the
diverse and wonderful communities that have already adopted its concepts. 




It will also bring to light cultures and communities that
may often be overlooked. From communities in Israel who do not subscribe to
hatred and violence to communities that promote medicinal healing and
shamanistic practices, there are many places in the world that are reviewed
briefly in the history books yet do not provide a comprehensive understanding
of culture. While I do not believe it is possible to compile a complete history
of a culture from a four to six month stay in a given society, I do hope to
create interest in the cultures of the permaculture communities that I will be
visiting. 


What I Need
I am looking for sponsorship for airfare between the
different countries. This includes four flights (including one round-trip fare
to Kansas City, Missouri to Lima, Peru where I will be taking a break between
Lima, Peru and Israel to review notes and complete research. This round trip
will also save money, as the flight from Sydney, Australia to Lima, Peru is
twice as expensive as that between Kansas City and Lima). The flights are
broken down as follows (fares based on extensive research of inexpensive but
trustworthy airlines):

            Paris,
France to Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa                          $880

            Cape Town,
Western Cape, South Africa to Chennai, India                        $660

            Chennai,
India to Sydney, Australia                                                             $682

            Kansas
City, Missouri, USA to Lima, Peru (round-trip ticket)                       $1250

                        (I
will be paying for trip from Australia to Kansas City, Missouri, USA)

            Kansas
City, Missouri, USA to Tel Aviv, Israel                                             $1647

                                                Total Airfare                                   $5119

 

In addition to paying for transportation on the ground, I
will be covering my own visa expenses as well as vaccination and medical
expenses including one year of health insurance. I am hoping, however, that the
second year of health insurance will be provided through your generous
donations. I will be purchasing health insurance for travelers through World
Nomads for $913 per year. 

 

The addition of $913 of health insurance to the airfare total, completes the
request at
 
$6032 (total: airfare+1 year
of health insurance). 

Your donations are greatly appreciated and I hope
that the completion of this project will touch not only those who are currently
interested in permaculture and sustainable design, but those who have not yet come
to understand these concepts and the wonderful good they can do for individual
communities and our world as a whole. 

 

*Any additional money will be donated to CitySprouts, an
organization that is not founded on the principles of permaculture but an
organization that provides a wonderful service to the youth of Cambridge, MA.
They work to provide 12 gardens that are used as teaching tools to further
public education for the grade schools in Cambridge. I was fortunate enough to
work with them for a year and they have inspired me to seek out communities
around the world that provide gardens and education to children and adults

<p>Our Story</p>
<p> Increasingly popular, modern skiing and snowboarding culture are coming to be defined by 'bigger, better and more Extreme': more adrenaline, bigger table tops, better gear, and more extreme parks, flips and parties.  In a race to grow fueled by the industry, skiing is becoming increasingly man made and expensive. Ski towns and ski resorts are forced to compete and grow as well. Though exciting, this lifestyle and the large ski town developments leave a trail of unseen consequences around the world. Sadly, this transformation is making skiing one of the least sustainable outdoor activities we partake in. Many wonder if this is necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Vermont 'Extreme' Skiers Skyler Perkins and Silas Chickering-Ayers seek to better understand what is at the heart of sustainability and see skiing as an effective medium for their exploration.

Leaving ski lifts, lodges and terrain parks behind, the two set out to experience skiing in it's purest form.</p>

<p> For further understanding of human's role in the cycles of nature, the travelers also live in a small indigenous village in the jungles of Mexico facing increasing outside influence.

<p> The Impact</p>
<p> Through this film, we are exploring ‘sustainability’ on a deeper level -- one that moves beyond sustainability as a political tool, a marketing scheme, or the latest academic trend. Instead, the skiers search for a new ‘sustainability’ that is reflected in a ‘state of being’, an integrous way of life that respects the environment, the community and ultimately our humanity -- and one that inherently preserves our future.

</div>","Help us Paint MORE Rain Barrels
for our Traveling Exhibit by The Collinwood Painted
Rain Barrel Project.
12 hand painted 55 gallon
rain barrels by local artists will be on exhibit at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History March 1st-30th with special events on 3/22: World Water Day.They travel to the Great Lakes Science Center for April, with special events on Earth
Day. State cuts in cultural funding has kept museums from more support.
This is a creative idea to help residents embrace water conservation and draw
in more reluctant participants. The exhibit will travel
NEOhio nature centers and parks for at least a year, and we’d like to offer workshops to all of our
hosts.
7 of our artists are paid, but 5
more are waiting; not having received all of the grants we applied for, we'll
borrow past artists painted barrels from our workshops, to be replaced as we receive funding (these artists want to install and reuse their own rain water in the Spring).
Here on the North Coast of
the US, in Cleveland Ohio, we are a block away from Lake Erie: One of the
largest freshwater sources in the world.
Surface rainwater sweeps motor
vehicle, lawn chemicals and pet waste that combine with storm water runoff into
sewers, and overflow, untreated, into the Lake. This slurry, along with excess industrial
farm fertilizer and winter road salt are causing toxic algae blooms, dead zones, and endangering the
health of this freshwater source.
Rain Barrels help keep
surface water onsite at homes, OUT of the sewer! Rain Barrels are practical
but NOT pretty.
In fact they are: Quite
Gnarly.
We want them to be Beautiful
and COOL to OWN and USE.
Our exhibit will expose many
thousands of museum and park visitors to the potential
for BEAUTY, FREE WATER and that WE ALL can help keep our
Lake and Waterways CLEANER!
The photos in the slideshow are
from my own pilot painted rain barrel that sparked this project. Neighborhood workshops
are included as we raise funds and our community benefits. The ‘We are
Sustainable’ image is from Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson’s Office of Sustainability,
who used my barrel in their Summit poster project.
We’re Partially Funded by:
Green City/Blue Lake Institute, Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, Cleveland Water Pollution Control, Cleveland Lakefront Parks Conservancy.
Every dollar will help, even if we don’t make our
goal. If we go over our goal, we’ll hire more artists to paint barrels, to auction to
help fund more workshops. When artists work, we invest in our communities:
win/win/win.

</h3> <p>
</p><p>Light
pollution is one of the most pervasive forms of pollution on the planet. More
than 60% of the world’s population live under polluted skies, and in developed
countries the total is nearly 100%!</p>
<p>In the last
100 years we have gradually enveloped ourselves in a luminous fog that has
diminished the night. All life on Earth has evolved over billions of years with
the alternating pattern of light during day and dark during the night. But we
upset this natural rhythm in the twinkling of an eye.</p>
<p>Light
pollution destroys the chance to admire the greatest nature wonder of all: our
own universe. Our children grow up without the possibility of taking
inspiration from a starry sky: inspiration that accompanied humanity from the
beginning of time and has profound roots in religion, philosophy, literature,
and science.</p>

I worked on light pollution for more than 20 years, as a researcher at ISTIL - Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute (<a href=""http://www.istil.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.istil.eu</a><a href="""" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>) and as president of CieloBuio, Association for the protection of the night sky (<a href=""http://www.cielobuio.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cielobuio.org</a>). At ISTIL we realized the first world atlas of light pollution (<a href=""http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/328/3/689.short"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/328/3/689.short</a>). <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/740969/files/20140724093302-WA_LR.jpg?1406219582"" src="""" style=""""/></p>CieloBuio was able, with our hard work, to help protect most of Italy with laws against light pollution. Laws that inspired foreign countries such as Slovenja, Chile, Spain, Czeck Republic to follow the example. More than 50 millions people benefit of these laws.<br/><p>Luminous signs are one of the most polluting sources of light. We found a way to almost null their impact to the sky and to diminish their glaring effects. We need your help to protect and develop this idea toward a functioning product.</p><p><br/></p> <p> </p><h3>We lose the starry sky<br/>
</h3> <p>
</p><p>Everyone,
until the advent of light pollution could admire the Milky Way, our own galaxy,
crossing the sky from horizon to horizon, like in this all-sky photo taken from
a remote site in Namibian desert. It is a breath taking experience we cannot anymore enjoy.<br/></p>

see only artificial lights, everywhere but the remotest sites of all. Even in
the National Parks of South West USA it is almost impossible to have the
nocturnal landscape not ruined by light domes at the horizon.<br/><p></p><p></p><p>Alps are polluted by cities that may be hundred of kilometres away.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/741017/files/20140724094947-001_Pizzoc_copy.jpg?1406220587"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Our are the first generations that grown up without
the possibility of being inspired by the starry sky. This is a huge cultural
loss. <p> </p><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Impact on Environmeent and our Health<br/>
</h3><p><i>'What if we woke up one morning to realize that all conservation
planning of the last 30 years told only half the story - the daytime story?'-
Catherine Rich and Travis Longcore in Ecological Consequences of Artificial
Night Lighting</i><br/></p>
<p>Light
pollution also has profound negative consequences on the environment. A
majority of animal species are nocturnal, and as such, they regulate all their
activities in the natural light available, from the lowest levels of a cloudy
night with no moon to the brightest nights around full moon. Man has upset all
this in the last decades.</p>

<h3>How to stop light pollution?<br/>
</h3>
<p>While most
types of lighting can now be less polluting—street lighting can be done with
fully shielded luminaires, parking lots too, and even stadium lighting can be
made in lower polluting versions—one source of light pollution remains as
polluting as ever: luminous advertising signs. Both static and dynamic types
pollute in every direction, unless you shut off them. </p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>We have found
a way to lower light pollution and glare form luminous signs without
compromising their visibility from where usually the observer is: on the
ground. Those who live near luminous signs will no longer have his or her
bedroom lighted by these lights, while those who are walking on the street will
see shop signs as usual.</p>
<p>How does it
work?</p>
<p>The product
will be a plastic film with optical properties that will allow light from signs
to go only where needed—not into the sky, into the night environment or into bedrooms.</p>
We have already performed optical software
simulations showing that the signs will be as bright as usual toward the
observers, but will be almost black as seen from above.<br/><p>A luminous

'This
important new system concept is an efficient, practical and low-cost contribution
to the effort now getting under way in many parts of the world to improve the
use of light - by directing it just to where it is needed.   This
will contribute to reducing costly and unnecessary waste, as well as reducing
damage to the environment and to human health.'
Dr. Travis Longcore, Professorof Spatial Sciences at
University of Southern California, Science Director of The Urban Wildlands
Group, editor of the book Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting
'Light pollution and its effects on humans and other species alike can be reduced 
in five ways -- turning off unneeded lights, reducing light intensity, limiting 
duration, using an appropriate spectrum of light, and directing the light only 
where it is necessary.  Directing light appropriately for single fixtures may be 
straightforward, but it is much more complex for large surfaces emitting light. 
 Falchi offers a novel solution to the challenge of properly directly light from 
surfaces, with the promise of reducing the adverse effects of such sources on 
the night sky and the nocturnal environment. '
Prof. Paul
Bogard, author of the best seller 'The End of Night':'Wonderful
news for anyone who loves a starry night!  Now, for the first time, we
have a way to control the polluting light from luminous signs. The question has
always been how to allow luminous signs in the night without casting glare,
polluting the night, and wiping away the stars. The intense light from these
signs is too often sent straight into the sky, into our eyes, into our
bedrooms. This new product offers an answer to please both owners of signs and
those who care about preserving our nights, an answer to please us all.' Pedro Sanhueza Pérez, Director OPCC
 - Oficina de Protección de la Calidad del Cielo del  Norte de Chile 
(Institute for the protection of sky quality in Northern Chile)'The impact of billboards in light pollution is growing 
enormously due to the new  LED big screens being installed around the 
world. They were originally designed to work with day light, but now it is 
common to use them at night time, provoking a significant negative impact on the 
quality on the night. For this reason, the new revolutionary system proposed 
by Dr. Fabio Falchi, which redirects the light from luminous signs, reducing the 
upper hemisphere emission, is quite significant. So, wonderful news for the 
night environment.'Pierantonio
 Cinzano, Ph.D., President of ISTIL - Light Pollution Science and 
Technology Intitute; author of the first book on light pollution 
'inquinamento luminoso e protezione del cielo notturno', 1996'It
 is fundamental that progress and development of lighting being directed
 toward lowering environmental impact and toward a better control of 
light. Dr.
Falchi's research to get a new type of luminous sign can be a decisive 
step
forward in this sector. In fact, up to now the only way to limit light
pollution from luminous signs was to reduce their light, by diminishing 
their
number, dimensions and luminosity.'Cipriano Marín, Coordinator of the Starlight Initiative & Secretary 
General of the UNESCO Center of the Canary Islands.'Curbing light pollution need real and smart solutions. The luminous signs 
and billboards contribute significantly to increase light pollution, but their 
adverse effects may be easily avoided. The ground-breaking project led by Dr. 
Falchi is a significant step towards the common commitment to reverse this 
trend. A milestone which will save energy, better protect the environment, 
improve the quality of life and recover the starlight. The solutions are in our 
hands.'Dr. Tyler Nordgren, astronomer at University of Redlands, former board member 
International Dark-Sky Association, author of Stars Above, Earth Below: A Guide 
to Astronomy in the National Parks., is a new testimonial of the campaign.Every year more billboards are installed along America's interstate freeway 
system and every year more of those are converted to electronic signs. The 
growing light from these signs is already impacting previously pristine skies 
over America's National Parks. This technology has the power to protect these 
last remaining dark-sky sanctuaries from lights that will only increase in 
number and brightness with time.Javier Díaz Castro, Ms Electrical & Industrial Engineer,  Chief OTPC
 (Oficina Técnica para la Protección de la Calidad del Cielo - Technical
 Office for the Sky Quality Protection) in Instituto de Astrofísica de 
Canarias.'This new optical system is very effective to dramatically reduce the contribution to light pollution by backlit signs (light boxes) and LED screens. These luminaries are a big portion in the overall contribution of light pollution (up to 50% in places where lighting is used with reduced light pollution).I encouraged you so that this project comes to fruition to improve our environment and our health'.Light Pollution?
 
Light
pollution is one of the most pervasive forms of pollution on the planet. More
than 60% of the world’s population live under polluted skies, and in developed
countries the total is nearly 100%!
In the last
100 years we have gradually enveloped ourselves in a luminous fog that has
diminished the night. All life on Earth has evolved over billions of years with
the alternating pattern of light during day and dark during the night. But we
upset this natural rhythm in the twinkling of an eye.
Light
pollution destroys the chance to admire the greatest nature wonder of all: our
own universe. Our children grow up without the possibility of taking
inspiration from a starry sky: inspiration that accompanied humanity from the
beginning of time and has profound roots in religion, philosophy, literature,
and science.

I worked on light pollution for more than 20 years, as a researcher at ISTIL - Light Pollution Science and Technology Institute (http://www.istil.eu) and as president of CieloBuio, Association for the protection of the night sky (http://www.cielobuio.org). At ISTIL we realized the first world atlas of light pollution (http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/328/3/689.short). CieloBuio was able, with our hard work, to help protect most of Italy with laws against light pollution. Laws that inspired foreign countries such as Slovenja, Chile, Spain, Czeck Republic to follow the example. More than 50 millions people benefit of these laws.Luminous signs are one of the most polluting sources of light. We found a way to almost null their impact to the sky and to diminish their glaring effects. We need your help to protect and develop this idea toward a functioning product.  We lose the starry sky
 
Everyone,
until the advent of light pollution could admire the Milky Way, our own galaxy,
crossing the sky from horizon to horizon, like in this all-sky photo taken from
a remote site in Namibian desert. It is a breath taking experience we cannot anymore enjoy.
Now we can
see only artificial lights, everywhere but the remotest sites of all. Even in
the National Parks of South West USA it is almost impossible to have the
nocturnal landscape not ruined by light domes at the horizon.Alps are polluted by cities that may be hundred of kilometres away.Our are the first generations that grown up without
the possibility of being inspired by the starry sky. This is a huge cultural
loss.  The Impact on Environmeent and our Health
'What if we woke up one morning to realize that all conservation
planning of the last 30 years told only half the story - the daytime story?'-
Catherine Rich and Travis Longcore in Ecological Consequences of Artificial
Night Lighting
Light
pollution also has profound negative consequences on the environment. A
majority of animal species are nocturnal, and as such, they regulate all their
activities in the natural light available, from the lowest levels of a cloudy
night with no moon to the brightest nights around full moon. Man has upset all
this in the last decades.
Moths and
other insects are fatally attracted by artificial lights, destroying the
natural food chain.
Fireflies
cannot mate in our ever glowing night environment.Sea turtle babies follow
the artificial lights and miss the sea, going to die on the following day.
These are only few examples of light pollution consequences on environment.Exposing
our body to light during the night is not a wise thing. Our health too is
affected by the disruption of our circadian rhythms. Melatonin production is
lowered or stopped even with our modern times 'normal' nocturnal light levels
of artificial light.

<h3><strong>Help researching South American moths</strong></h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Patrick Strutzenberger, I am an evolutionary biologist working in collaboration with the University of Vienna (Austria). I have devoted most of my career to researching South American moths.</p>
<p><strong>What will be funded?</strong></p>
<p>The ""product"" resulting from this campaign is a publication in a scientific journal. This publication will describe results gained from analyzing the evolution of a group of moths called <i>Psaliodes</i>. The plan is to submit the manuscript to the journal in November/December of this year for a publication sometime in the first half of 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Why study moths?</strong></p>
<p>In comparison to butterflies moths are flying under the public radar. This is also true in science, moths are dangerously under-studied. However, moths are much more diverse than butterflies and at least as beautiful as butterflies are. For the topics that are to be studied here moths are actually far more interesting, their high diversity allows to study their evolution in detail. A lot of data is required to reconstruct evolutionary processes. This amount of data can only be provided through the study of highly diverse groups of animals. The study of these moths is therefore essential to resolve why there are so many species in the tropics. Tropical ecosystems exhibit unimaginable complexity, conservation of these ecosystems is dependent on detailed knowledge on what factors are responsible for their complexity in the first place. We are just now beginning to understand these factors and their effects.</p>
<p><strong>Where do they live?</strong></p>
<p>The South American Andes are one of the most bio-diverse regions on the planet. Most groups of land animals and plants have some of their highest species numbers worldwide in the Andes. The cloud forests of the northern Andes are known to harbor an exceptionally high number of moth species. In a tiny area of only two square kilometers in Ecuador researchers have found over 1400 species just from one single family of moths. Most of those species are not even named yet and there are countless more species yet to be discovered.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499882486/d8kbbjp2c1fbwm2qwnuf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What exactly will be studied?</strong></p>
<p>Over the past 15 years researchers have collected a large number of moths in the South American Andes. In these studies people were focused on determining how many moths are present and how they are distributed. The moths collected during this studies are now available for further research. Instead of simply asking the questions ""who?"" and ""where?"" the purpose of this campaign is to ask ""how?"".</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How come that this region harbors that many species?</strong></li>
<li><strong>When did these species arise?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Did species evolve at a constant rate or in bursts?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How are they related to other moths?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I am going to use DNA sequences to delve into detail of one group of moths. The genus <i>Psaliodes </i>is one the most commonly found moths in this area and is part of the family of inchworm moths (Geometridae). The moths have already been sorted, photographically documented and DNA sequences have been acquired in a laboratory at the University of Vienna.</p>
<p><a href=""#German"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499543320/heltifm7xczl0oi02ecv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>I will use state of the art algorithms to calculate a phylogenetic tree. This tree will tell us how the moths are related to each other. The length of the branches on this tree tells us how distant the species are from each other. Relating those distances to geological time allows us to calculate when and how fast the moths evolved.</p>
<p><a href=""#German"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499552963/yfmrqeen9c122i682nna.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<h3><strong>What I Need</strong></h3>
<p>The optimal funding level for this campaign is 4000 Euros. With this amount of funding I will be able to analyze the data to the fullest extent possible and make the best possible contribution to the knowledge of earth's biodiversity.</p>
<p><strong>Primary items your contribution will fund:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The core of this project is analyzing the data and writing a publication. This is very time consuming. I need financial support that permits me to devote time to this project.</li>
<li>Maintenance and improvement of computer hardware required to analyze the data, especially the purchase of urgently required hard drives to store the large amount of data generated during analyses.</li>
<li>Covering the rent for a Linux server to be used for data analysis.</li>
<li>Cover cost for software licenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cost breakdown:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500835045/pbynizwb6rjgqfhhyusr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If the campaign does NOT meet its goal</strong> I will focus funding on essential items only. That means that all focus will be on submitting the publication. In this case the analyses will be less in-depth and the data cannot be used to its full potential. This will ensure that the data will still get published and is available to everybody. Other researchers are then able to use the data for further research.</p>
<p><strong>If the campaign exceeds its goal </strong>all funds will be used to either extend the scope of the present project or alternatively will be used to improve infrastructure or go directly to fund the next project. Here are some examples for items that could be funded when this campaign exceeds its goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover open-access publication fees for the planned publication. Those fees are usually between 1500 and 3000 Euros, depending on the journal. This will increase the visibility of this research and make it accessible to everyone, even those who don't have access to costly journal subscriptions.</li>
<li>Support subsequent efforts to describe and name so far unnamed species</li>
<li>Contracting additional team members for specific tasks and therefore increase the quality of the publication and reduce the time required.</li>
<li>Creation of a website to spread the word about South American moths.</li>
<li>Contribute to the next project! If this campaign exceeds its goal by a large margin all supporters will be asked to vote on which group of moths to tackle next.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Helfen Sie Südamerikanische Nachtfalter zu erforschen</strong></h3>
<p>Willkommen, mein Name ist Patrick Strutzenberger. Ich bin Evolutionsbiologe und arbeite derzeit mit Wissenschaftlern der Universität Wien zusammen. Schon seit meiner Diplomarbeit interessiere ich mich für die Erforschung südamerikanischer Nachtfalter.</p>
<p><strong>Was soll finanziert werden?</strong></p>
<p>Das „Produkt“ dieser Kampagne ist eine wissenschaftliche Publikation in einer Fachzeitschrift. Darin sollen Ergebnisse aus der Untersuchung zur Evolution der Nachtfaltergattung <i>Psaliodes</i> veröffentlicht werden. Ich plane das Manuskript im November/Dezember dieses Jahres bei einer Zeitschrift einzureichen, so dass es in der ersten Jahreshälfte 2018 veröffentlicht werden kann.</p>
<p><strong>Warum Nachtfalter?</strong></p>
<p>Nachtfalter stehen in der öffentlichen Wahrnehmung sehr oft im Schatten der Tagfalter. Auch in der Wissenschaft sind Nachtfalter vergleichsweise weniger untersucht, obwohl sie mindestens genauso hübsch sind wie Tagfalter. Hinsichtlich der Fragestellungen, die hier untersucht werden sollen sind Nachtfalter sogar viel interessanter als Tagfalter. Um Evolutionsprozesse im Detail zu untersuchen, wird eine große Menge an Daten benötigt, die nur aus sehr artenreichen Tiergruppen gewonnen werden können. Um zu verstehen warum es in den Tropen so viele Arten gibt ist die Forschung an diesen Nachtfaltern unverzichtbar. Tropische Ökosysteme weisen eine unvorstellbar hohe Komplexität auf. Der Schutz dieser Ökosysteme ist nur dann möglich, wenn man die Faktoren die zu dieser Komplexität geführt haben, kennt. Erst vor kurzem hat man begonnen diese Faktoren und deren Effekte zu verstehen.</p>
<p><strong>Wo leben diese Nachtfalter?</strong></p>
<p>Die südamerikanischen Anden sind eine der artenreichsten Regionen auf unserem Planeten mit einer der höchsten Artenzahlen an Tieren und Pflanzen weltweit. Die Nebelwälder der nördlichen Anden sind bekannt dafür, dass sie eine besonders hohe Zahl an Nachfalterarten beherbergen. In einem winzigen, nur etwa zwei Quadratkilometer großen Gebiet in Ecuador, haben Wissenschaftler über 1400 Arten aus nur einer einzigen Familie von Nachtfaltern gefunden. Die meisten dieser Arten haben nicht einmal einen Namen und viele weitere sind noch gar nicht entdeckt worden.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499882509/erw2i26jxpuduzdxaagl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Was genau soll untersucht werden?</strong></p>
<p>In den letzten 15 Jahren wurden im Rahmen mehrerer Studien eine große Anzahl an Nachtfaltern in den Anden gesammelt. Es wurde untersucht wie viele Arten in den Bergregenwäldern in Süd-Ecuador vorkommen und wie sie verbreitet sind. Die Tiere die in diesen Projekten gesammelt wurden, stehen mir nun für weitere Forschung zur Verfügung. Anstatt der Beantwortung der Fragen ""Wer?"" und ""Wo?"", dient diese Kampagne dazu die weitaus spannendere Frage des ""Wie?"" zu beantworten.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warum gibt es in dieser Region so viele Arten?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wann sind diese Arten entstanden?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sind diese Arten über die Zeit gleichmäßig verteilt oder unterschiedlich schnell entstanden?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wie sind diese Falter mit anderen Faltern verwandt?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In diesem Projekt, dass ich hier finanzieren möchte, werde ich zur Beantwortung dieser Fragen DNA Sequenzen verwenden. Die Gattung <i>Psaliodes</i> ist eine der häufigsten in der Region und gehört zur Familie der Spanner (Geometridae). Die Tiere sind bereits sortiert und fotografiert und zusätzlich wurden DNA Sequenzen in einem Labor an der Universität Wien gewonnen.</p>

<p>Ich werde diese DNA Sequenzen verwenden, um mit den aktuellsten Methoden einen Stammbaum zu berechnen. Dieser Stammbaum zeigt das Verwandtschaftsverhältnis der Nachtfalter und die Länge der Äste zeigt, wie stark sich die Arten voneinander unterscheiden. Wenn man diese Unterschiede zur vergangenen geologischen Zeit in Bezug setzt, kann man berechnen, wann und wie schnell die Evolution dieser Falter erfolgt ist.</p>

Help researching South American moths
Hello, my name is Patrick Strutzenberger, I am an evolutionary biologist working in collaboration with the University of Vienna (Austria). I have devoted most of my career to researching South American moths.
What will be funded?
The ""product"" resulting from this campaign is a publication in a scientific journal. This publication will describe results gained from analyzing the evolution of a group of moths called Psaliodes. The plan is to submit the manuscript to the journal in November/December of this year for a publication sometime in the first half of 2018.
Why study moths?
In comparison to butterflies moths are flying under the public radar. This is also true in science, moths are dangerously under-studied. However, moths are much more diverse than butterflies and at least as beautiful as butterflies are. For the topics that are to be studied here moths are actually far more interesting, their high diversity allows to study their evolution in detail. A lot of data is required to reconstruct evolutionary processes. This amount of data can only be provided through the study of highly diverse groups of animals. The study of these moths is therefore essential to resolve why there are so many species in the tropics. Tropical ecosystems exhibit unimaginable complexity, conservation of these ecosystems is dependent on detailed knowledge on what factors are responsible for their complexity in the first place. We are just now beginning to understand these factors and their effects.
Where do they live?
The South American Andes are one of the most bio-diverse regions on the planet. Most groups of land animals and plants have some of their highest species numbers worldwide in the Andes. The cloud forests of the northern Andes are known to harbor an exceptionally high number of moth species. In a tiny area of only two square kilometers in Ecuador researchers have found over 1400 species just from one single family of moths. Most of those species are not even named yet and there are countless more species yet to be discovered.

What exactly will be studied?
Over the past 15 years researchers have collected a large number of moths in the South American Andes. In these studies people were focused on determining how many moths are present and how they are distributed. The moths collected during this studies are now available for further research. Instead of simply asking the questions ""who?"" and ""where?"" the purpose of this campaign is to ask ""how?"".

How come that this region harbors that many species?
When did these species arise?
Did species evolve at a constant rate or in bursts?
How are they related to other moths?

I am going to use DNA sequences to delve into detail of one group of moths. The genus Psaliodes is one the most commonly found moths in this area and is part of the family of inchworm moths (Geometridae). The moths have already been sorted, photographically documented and DNA sequences have been acquired in a laboratory at the University of Vienna.

I will use state of the art algorithms to calculate a phylogenetic tree. This tree will tell us how the moths are related to each other. The length of the branches on this tree tells us how distant the species are from each other. Relating those distances to geological time allows us to calculate when and how fast the moths evolved.

What I Need
The optimal funding level for this campaign is 4000 Euros. With this amount of funding I will be able to analyze the data to the fullest extent possible and make the best possible contribution to the knowledge of earth's biodiversity.
Primary items your contribution will fund:

The core of this project is analyzing the data and writing a publication. This is very time consuming. I need financial support that permits me to devote time to this project.
Maintenance and improvement of computer hardware required to analyze the data, especially the purchase of urgently required hard drives to store the large amount of data generated during analyses.
Covering the rent for a Linux server to be used for data analysis.
Cover cost for software licenses.

Cost breakdown:

 
If the campaign does NOT meet its goal I will focus funding on essential items only. That means that all focus will be on submitting the publication. In this case the analyses will be less in-depth and the data cannot be used to its full potential. This will ensure that the data will still get published and is available to everybody. Other researchers are then able to use the data for further research.
If the campaign exceeds its goal all funds will be used to either extend the scope of the present project or alternatively will be used to improve infrastructure or go directly to fund the next project. Here are some examples for items that could be funded when this campaign exceeds its goal:

Cover open-access publication fees for the planned publication. Those fees are usually between 1500 and 3000 Euros, depending on the journal. This will increase the visibility of this research and make it accessible to everyone, even those who don't have access to costly journal subscriptions.
Support subsequent efforts to describe and name so far unnamed species
Contracting additional team members for specific tasks and therefore increase the quality of the publication and reduce the time required.
Creation of a website to spread the word about South American moths.
Contribute to the next project! If this campaign exceeds its goal by a large margin all supporters will be asked to vote on which group of moths to tackle next.

I can guarantee that every Euro being raised will directly contribute to the research on South American moths. The possibilities are endless.
Risks & Challenges
The campaigner and project leader is very experienced in this field of science and has published numerous publications in scientific journals. See here for a list of my publications in the same field of science.The most risky parts of doing research in the tropics have already been completed. The moths have already been collected and DNA sequences are ready for analysis. The most challenging part that remains is getting the publication out.

</div></div>","What’s this all about?The InspirationWe are a group of five Portland High School students seeking to determine the ways in which culture, education, and values inform sustainability behaviors. Our members include Jeremy Ravenelle, Kowsar Ahmed, Maria Mirijanyan, Victoria Webber, and Meghan Kelly. Through our experience with projects in Environmental Club, such as recycling in our school cafeteria, we know how difficult it is to change people’s behaviors. We also know that these behaviors are affecting the world around us and that the impacts of climate change are growing in our world. Gathering InformationTo help us determine the root of some of these behaviors, we will use a survey distributed to people in Stockholm, Sweden, Archangelsk, Russia, and Portland, Maine with a separate focus on the immigrant population.  To fully understand the data we receive from the survey and the cultures which we study, it is important that we travel to Archangelsk and Stockholm.  This will allow us to collect qualitative data directly, in the form of personal observations and interviews. Field work will also enable the development of a peer-to-peer exchange between all three communities, which will help the data gathered through our research to generate local, sustainable action. Future ImpactsOnce the data and observations are collected, the information will be used in classes at our school such as statistics, environmental science and psychology.  We hope this project will have positive impacts on our school as students embark on action projects that incorporate lessons learned from this research.  It will also provide information for future projects at the high schools in Archangelsk and Stockholm, and provide a catalyst for global change through our peer to peer exchange.



Where Will the Money Go?
The money that we hope to receive will go toward our travel expenses to both Sweden and Russia. If we are unable to reach our goal fewer people will be able to go. However, it is crucial to our project to have at least two people collect qualitative data. Below is a breakdown of funding for one student.
Budget for Sustainable Communities Research

Travel: (For 1 student) Airfare (Round trip)-

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>VRNACULARS (<a href=""http://www.vrnaculars.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.vrnaculars.com</a>) is a Virtual &amp; Augmented Reality content studio. We believe this technology can be highly impactful to make the world a better place. The most important and difficult challenge facing us today is the Sustainable Productivity challenge. Without large scale behavioral changes, we are unlikely to succeed in curtailing global warming, the ill effects of which are widely known. </p>
<p>To drive change of this magnitude, we need to form new habits, and we need to start with our youth. Just like we teach our children to brush our teeth everyday, we need to teach them to stop wasting food, to shift their diets, and to make environmentally friendly lifestyle choices like walking, biking or car pooling. However, we need to teach these habits in a way that they find engaging and exciting. Our project (<a href=""http://www.sustainableproductivity.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sustainableproductivity.org</a>) achieves exactly that. By leveraging the new technologies of VR &amp; AR, we can impress on our youth a sense of urgency and get them excited and passionate about making the behavioral changes that are needed, at the scale that is required. </p>
<p>If widely adopted, the solutions we propose in this project, across the three initiatives we are focused on (reducing food waste, shifting diets, and making environmentally-friendly lifestyle choices), could result in ~80-100 Million tons of GHG emissions reduction in the US annually!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this project happen, we need to raise $10K. The funding will be going specifically into three areas:</p>
<p>1. Creating or completing the content for the exhibits</p>
<p>2. Location, equipment and event organization related expenses</p>
<p>3. Promotion and marketing campaigns to create awareness</p>
<p>In return for funding this project, you will receive various rewards based on the level of your contributions, including social media shout outs, augmented reality t-shirts, recognition in the credits of the content we develop etc. Most importantly, you will be proud of having enabled a better future for our children and our planet.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions have been growing rapidly causing several detrimental effects. Sixteen of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. 92% of the world's population lives in areas where air pollution exceeds safe limits. By 2025, half of the world's population will be living in water stressed areas. This is the planet that are our children are going to inherit unless we cut greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%.</p>
<p>To make a meaningful dent in global GHG emissions, we must enable behavioral changes on a massive scale, which means we need to start with our children and our youth. This project leverages new technologies like Virtual &amp; Augmented Reality to engage, educate and energize youth to get actively involved in enabling behavioral change, and to lead by example. We are focused on the three drivers of emissions that each of us can directly impact via behavioral changes. These are:</p>
<p>1. Reducing food waste,</p>
<p>2. Shifting diets (reducing meat consumption)</p>
<p>3. Making eco-friendly lifestyle choices (e.g., water use, transportation etc.)</p>
<p>If widely adopted, the solutions we propose in this project, across the three initiatives we are focused on (reducing food waste, shifting diets, and making environmentally-friendly lifestyle choices), could result in ~80-100 Million tons of GHG emissions reduction in the US annually!</p>
<p>VRNACULARS has a track record with creating such immersive and interactive content. We have been trusted by leading global companies like Flex, Equinix, Kore IoT Solutions, TVS, and Anthem Biosciences to develop VR &amp; AR content and applications for them. We have designed and successfully conducted similar exhibitions for Enterprise clients, including a VR exhibition at the Consumer Electronics Show (the largest trade show in the world), and at trade shows in India and Brazil.  We are also working with the Media X Program at the University of the Pacific. They have produced several VR pieces, including a VR film on John Muir that has been recognized at several interactive media festivals. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We do not foresee any risks in creating the Virtual and Augmented Reality content for the exhibits. The greatest risk here lies in mobilizing people to get involved, to actively participate, and to spread the word about the exhibition. True impact will only come with scale, and to achieve scale we must have high levels of awareness, participation and evangelization. </p>
<p>To overcome this risk, we plan to partner with several other groups that are committed to these causes including organizations like Imperfect Produce, LA Kitchen, the University of the Pacific and other universities, Corporate Social Responsibility groups at various Enterprise, local governments and media organizations. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute to the campaign, you can still help us by actively promoting the campaign. Please help us spread the word! You can also help us by volunteering. Please reach out to us at ecoexhibition@vrnaculars.com for more information. </p>

It's the <strong>direct contact with people</strong> in their everyday lives that adds a big value to the message, because they get to see with their own eyes how much plastic I picked up in their very own neighborhoods.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573471886/qd2xpg0hrnabmuagiknz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573471926/rdqt7hyozoxdtp9fv0ae.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>So, what's next?</h3><p>I love a good challenge, and after cycling 2000km last summer I realized it wasn't enough.

<li>11 different European countries (<i>Italy, France, Spain, Andorra, Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Austria, Slovenia</i>)</li>
<li>5000-6000km approximately</li>

Well, with Cycle 2 Recycle there's simply no such risk. It's just me, an optimistic and idealistic individual who wants to contribute in her own, original way to raising more awareness about a very important environmental issue.</p><p>Your <strong>donation will go straight to the preparations</strong> for my 2020 adventure, like <strong>small adjustments</strong> to the cargo bike, the <strong>creation of the front container</strong> out of plastic bottles that I found during my trial rounds, and it will get me through the first weeks of the challenge.</p><p>Also, and this is not insignificant: if I reach my goal here on indiegogo, this crowdfunding c<strong>ampaign can remain active much longer</strong> than the usual 60 days. Being able to receive donations for an extended period of time will be a huge game-changer for me and my future projects.</p><p>One of those future projects is the <strong>foundation of a recycling center</strong>. At this recycle center I will be able to recycle the plastic I pick up with the cargo bike, hold presentations and workshops especially for children (because they are the future), and it will allow me to connect with the community &amp; educate them on the importance of decreasing our consumption of disposable plastics.</p><p> </p><h3>Awesome! Do you offer some cool perks for those who decide to sponsor you?</h3><p>Besides plastics, one of the other very polluting industries out there is the clothing industry. Because I don't want to contribute to this huge problem, I decided to offer only a couple of perks, made from <strong>organic, eco-friendly materials</strong>.</p><p>Backers will be able to obtain a Cycle 2 Recycle t-shirt and/or a Cycle 2 Recycle canvas tote bag, both made from organic materials.</p><p> </p><h3>Are there other ways I can help?</h3><p>Sure! If you cannot make a (small) donation right now, that's ok: my main goal is &amp; will always remain to raise more awareness about the plastic problem and inspire people to change their habits.

 Tell me, why should I support your cause?Do you also feel how you never really know where your charity money exactly ends up when donating to big(ger) organizations? Well, with Cycle 2 Recycle there's simply no such risk. It's just me, an optimistic and idealistic individual who wants to contribute in her own, original way to raising more awareness about a very important environmental issue.Your donation will go straight to the preparations for my 2020 adventure, like small adjustments to the cargo bike, the creation of the front container out of plastic bottles that I found during my trial rounds, and it will get me through the first weeks of the challenge.Also, and this is not insignificant: if I reach my goal here on indiegogo, this crowdfunding campaign can remain active much longer than the usual 60 days. Being able to receive donations for an extended period of time will be a huge game-changer for me and my future projects.One of those future projects is the foundation of a recycling center. At this recycle center I will be able to recycle the plastic I pick up with the cargo bike, hold presentations and workshops especially for children (because they are the future), and it will allow me to connect with the community & educate them on the importance of decreasing our consumption of disposable plastics. Awesome! Do you offer some cool perks for those who decide to sponsor you?Besides plastics, one of the other very polluting industries out there is the clothing industry. Because I don't want to contribute to this huge problem, I decided to offer only a couple of perks, made from organic, eco-friendly materials.Backers will be able to obtain a Cycle 2 Recycle t-shirt and/or a Cycle 2 Recycle canvas tote bag, both made from organic materials. Are there other ways I can help?Sure! If you cannot make a (small) donation right now, that's ok: my main goal is & will always remain to raise more awareness about the plastic problem and inspire people to change their habits. So the most important way you can help me is to share my ideas and projects with your friends, family, and colleagues. How can you share?You can use the sharing tools here on Indiegogo, go to my website www.cycle2recycle.org, or start following me:Facebook --> https://www.facebook.com/Cycle2Recycle.OfficialInstagram --> https://www.instagram.com/cycle.2.recycleTwitter --> https://twitter.com/cycle2_recycleYou can also contact me at info@cycle2recycle.org",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>IN ENGLISH BELOW</p>
<p></p>
<p>Du 29 mai à la mi-juillet 2016, des centaines de personnes se joindront à une marche d’environ 20 km par jour pour s’opposer au transport et à l’exploitation des hydrocarbures en Gaspésie. <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/peuples-pour-la-terre-mere-peoples-for-mother-earth#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nous avons réalisé une marche semblable en 2014 sur plus de 700 km entre Cacouna et Kanehsatà:ke</a> pour s’opposer à l’oléoduc Énergie Est de TransCanada, cette fois nous rechausserons nos souliers pour protéger la Gaspésie. </p>
<p>Le long du <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SppI9fJS5wP_N_lA3DRDy6pTiMWt-zeghR1APJvJCz0/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trajet</a>, nos objectifs sont d’attirer l’attention médiatique sur ces enjeux écologiques, de dénoncer l'attitude coloniale des compagnies et des gouvernements en territoire Mi'gmaq non-cédé, d’encourager la mobilisation pour protéger l’environnement et de rencontrer les communautés touchées en organisant des spectacles engagés et des discussions. </p>Comparativement à d’autres types d’actions, une longue marche permet de tisser des liens entre les différents groupes distribués sur le territoire, de saluer les actions d’activistes locaux et de créer de profondes amitiés. Marcher crée aussi un attachement aux paysages, à la Terre, semant ainsi les graines d’actions futures. <p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460478638/Carte_Gaspesie2_mzzofu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>10 raisons pour soutenir la marche</h3> <p></p>
<ol>
<li><p>PROJET BELLEDUNE : <b>La compagnie Chaleur Terminals caresse le projet de faire circuler plus de 200 wagons de pétrole par jour, en provenance des sables bitumineux de l’Alberta</b>, par la Gaspésie jusqu’à Belledune au Nouveau-Brunswick. La population et les cours d’eau sont menacés par le risque d’un déraillement comme celui de Lac-Mégantic. Ce projet contribue à encourager l’extraction de pétrole dessables bitumineux en Alberta qui en plus d’empoisonner l’environnement albertain et la population est une menace majeure pour le climat.</p></li>
<li><p>Les trois communautés <b>Mi’kmaq de Gaspésie n’ont été ni consultées ni accommodées pour ce projet</b> de transport de pétrole par train et s’opposent à cette violation de leur traité. Plusieurs maires de municipalités s’opposent au projet de Chaleur Terminals, dont ceux d’Amqui et Rimouski.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Gastem poursuit le village de Ristigouche-Sud-Est</b>,qui compte 168 habitants, pour une somme de 1,5 millions dollars parce qu’il a osé adopter un règlement pour protéger son eau potable des forages pétroliers.</p></li>
<li><p>Pour être rentable, <b>l’exploitation pétrolière et gazière en Gaspésie nécessitera des milliers de puits et l’utilisation de la fracturation</b>. Bien que les pétrolières disent ne pas utiliser cette technique pour l’instant, la fracturation pourrait multiplier leur production par un facteur 100. On peut donc s’attendre à des pressions de leur part pour que la fracturation soit autorisée.</p></li>
<li><p>La fracturation hydraulique consiste à injecter des substances toxiques (ex.: chlorure de potassium, benzène, toluène) et environ 8 millions de litres d’eau par puits pour fracturer la roche en profondeur. Des recherches ont démontré <b>un lien entre la présence de puits de fracturation hydraulique et une augmentation du nombre de fausses couches</b> ainsi que de malformations congénitales chez les nouveaux-nés. La fracturation a également causé des <b>tremblements de terre</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>PROJET HALDIMAND : <b>La compagnie Pétrolia a déjà foré quatre puits dans le secteur Haldimand près de Gaspé</b>. Ceux-ci représentent une menace à l’eau potable. Bien que Haldimand-4 se trouve à moins de 150 mètres d’un cours d’eau qui se jette dans une rivière à saumons, en novembre et décembre 2015 Pétrolia a injecté 70,000 litres de fluides avec 15% d'acide chlorydrique dans son puits pour le nettoyer. PROJET GALT : <b>Junex a foré des puits près de Gaspé et de Bonaventure dans la Baie des chaleurs</b>.</p></li>
<li><p>PROJET BOURQUE : Junex  et Tugliq planifient d’exploiter plusieurs puits près de Murdochville et de <b>construire un oléoduc pour transporter du gaz naturel jusqu’au port de Sandy Beach à Gaspé</b>. Le gaz serait liquéfié au port et transporté par bateau vers la Côte Nord.</p></li>
<li><p>La cimenterie qui est en construction à Port-Daniel, sans avoir eu recours à un BAPE, émettra <b>annuellement 1,75 millions de tonnes de gaz à effet de serre</b> (GES). Elle utilisera comme source d’énergie <b>du coke provenant des sables bitumineux en Alberta</b> ce qui équivaut à subventioner cette industrie destructrice.</p></li>
<li><p>PROJET ÉNERGIE EST : Si TransCanada construit l’oléoduc <b>Energie Est </b>pour transporter 1,1 millions de barils par jour le long du fleuve Saint-Laurent, alors <b>une fuite de cet oléoduc aurait un impact écologique important sur le nord de la Gaspésie</b>.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Notre marche a besoin de votre aide</b> pour voir le jour !</p></li>
</ol>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Pourquoi le financement ?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Il est très important pour nous que la marche soit accessible à toutes et tous. Nous voulons que les marcheuses et marcheurs puissent dormir et manger sans frais pendant la marche. Pour cela, nous travaillons en ce moment même avec les communautés tout au long de la route pour limiter le plus possible les dépenses.</p>
<p>Mais nous avons quand même besoin de vous ! Nous aurons beaucoup de bouches à nourrir, de l’information et une trousse de mobilisation à diffuser, du matériel à acheter, des artistes locaux à encourager et bien plus encore.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460479290/Budget_Francais_nuuhhg.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 565.477px;height: 363px;""/></p>
<p>Si nous atteignons le but fixé avec un surplus, les fonds seront utilisés pour financer d’autres actions contre les hydrocarbures. D'ailleurs, nous avons fait un surplus en 2014 et avons organisé avec cet argent <a href=""http://www.entreelibre.info/camp-ligne-9%E2%80%AF-resistance-citoyenne-a-lenvahisseur-petrolier/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">un camp contre l'inversion de l'oléoduc 9B de Enbridge</a>.

<h3>Come Walk Against Fossil Fuels In Gaspesie!</h3>
</div><p>From May 29th to mid-July 2016, hundreds of people will join a march of 20 km per day in order to oppose the transportation and extraction of fossil fuels in Gaspesie. <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/peuples-pour-la-terre-mere-peoples-for-mother-earth#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We accomplished a similar 700 km march in 2014 between Cacouna and Kanehsatà:ke</a> to oppose TransCanada’s Energy East pipeline project.

IN ENGLISH BELOW

Du 29 mai à la mi-juillet 2016, des centaines de personnes se joindront à une marche d’environ 20 km par jour pour s’opposer au transport et à l’exploitation des hydrocarbures en Gaspésie. Nous avons réalisé une marche semblable en 2014 sur plus de 700 km entre Cacouna et Kanehsatà:ke pour s’opposer à l’oléoduc Énergie Est de TransCanada, cette fois nous rechausserons nos souliers pour protéger la Gaspésie. 
Le long du trajet, nos objectifs sont d’attirer l’attention médiatique sur ces enjeux écologiques, de dénoncer l'attitude coloniale des compagnies et des gouvernements en territoire Mi'gmaq non-cédé, d’encourager la mobilisation pour protéger l’environnement et de rencontrer les communautés touchées en organisant des spectacles engagés et des discussions. Comparativement à d’autres types d’actions, une longue marche permet de tisser des liens entre les différents groupes distribués sur le territoire, de saluer les actions d’activistes locaux et de créer de profondes amitiés. Marcher crée aussi un attachement aux paysages, à la Terre, semant ainsi les graines d’actions futures. 


  10 raisons pour soutenir la marche 

PROJET BELLEDUNE : La compagnie Chaleur Terminals caresse le projet de faire circuler plus de 200 wagons de pétrole par jour, en provenance des sables bitumineux de l’Alberta, par la Gaspésie jusqu’à Belledune au Nouveau-Brunswick. La population et les cours d’eau sont menacés par le risque d’un déraillement comme celui de Lac-Mégantic. Ce projet contribue à encourager l’extraction de pétrole dessables bitumineux en Alberta qui en plus d’empoisonner l’environnement albertain et la population est une menace majeure pour le climat.
Les trois communautés Mi’kmaq de Gaspésie n’ont été ni consultées ni accommodées pour ce projet de transport de pétrole par train et s’opposent à cette violation de leur traité. Plusieurs maires de municipalités s’opposent au projet de Chaleur Terminals, dont ceux d’Amqui et Rimouski.
Gastem poursuit le village de Ristigouche-Sud-Est,qui compte 168 habitants, pour une somme de 1,5 millions dollars parce qu’il a osé adopter un règlement pour protéger son eau potable des forages pétroliers.
Pour être rentable, l’exploitation pétrolière et gazière en Gaspésie nécessitera des milliers de puits et l’utilisation de la fracturation. Bien que les pétrolières disent ne pas utiliser cette technique pour l’instant, la fracturation pourrait multiplier leur production par un facteur 100. On peut donc s’attendre à des pressions de leur part pour que la fracturation soit autorisée.
La fracturation hydraulique consiste à injecter des substances toxiques (ex.: chlorure de potassium, benzène, toluène) et environ 8 millions de litres d’eau par puits pour fracturer la roche en profondeur. Des recherches ont démontré un lien entre la présence de puits de fracturation hydraulique et une augmentation du nombre de fausses couches ainsi que de malformations congénitales chez les nouveaux-nés. La fracturation a également causé des tremblements de terre.
PROJET HALDIMAND : La compagnie Pétrolia a déjà foré quatre puits dans le secteur Haldimand près de Gaspé. Ceux-ci représentent une menace à l’eau potable. Bien que Haldimand-4 se trouve à moins de 150 mètres d’un cours d’eau qui se jette dans une rivière à saumons, en novembre et décembre 2015 Pétrolia a injecté 70,000 litres de fluides avec 15% d'acide chlorydrique dans son puits pour le nettoyer. PROJET GALT : Junex a foré des puits près de Gaspé et de Bonaventure dans la Baie des chaleurs.
PROJET BOURQUE : Junex  et Tugliq planifient d’exploiter plusieurs puits près de Murdochville et de construire un oléoduc pour transporter du gaz naturel jusqu’au port de Sandy Beach à Gaspé. Le gaz serait liquéfié au port et transporté par bateau vers la Côte Nord.
La cimenterie qui est en construction à Port-Daniel, sans avoir eu recours à un BAPE, émettra annuellement 1,75 millions de tonnes de gaz à effet de serre (GES). Elle utilisera comme source d’énergie du coke provenant des sables bitumineux en Alberta ce qui équivaut à subventioner cette industrie destructrice.
PROJET ÉNERGIE EST : Si TransCanada construit l’oléoduc Energie Est pour transporter 1,1 millions de barils par jour le long du fleuve Saint-Laurent, alors une fuite de cet oléoduc aurait un impact écologique important sur le nord de la Gaspésie.
Notre marche a besoin de votre aide pour voir le jour !

  
Pourquoi le financement ? 
Il est très important pour nous que la marche soit accessible à toutes et tous. Nous voulons que les marcheuses et marcheurs puissent dormir et manger sans frais pendant la marche. Pour cela, nous travaillons en ce moment même avec les communautés tout au long de la route pour limiter le plus possible les dépenses.
Mais nous avons quand même besoin de vous ! Nous aurons beaucoup de bouches à nourrir, de l’information et une trousse de mobilisation à diffuser, du matériel à acheter, des artistes locaux à encourager et bien plus encore.


Si nous atteignons le but fixé avec un surplus, les fonds seront utilisés pour financer d’autres actions contre les hydrocarbures. D'ailleurs, nous avons fait un surplus en 2014 et avons organisé avec cet argent un camp contre l'inversion de l'oléoduc 9B de Enbridge. Nous vous demandons de contribuer à la marche à la hauteur de vos moyens. Chaque dollar aidera à faire de cette marche une réalité!




Le 'Québec', le 'Canada' et les Premières nations 

sont mobilisés.
Rejoignez le mouvement!
Aidez-nous à faire de la marche une réalité!




Venez marcher avec nous, que ce soit un mois ou une après-midi!
Parlez de la marche autour de vous!

Come Walk Against Fossil Fuels In Gaspesie!
From May 29th to mid-July 2016, hundreds of people will join a march of 20 km per day in order to oppose the transportation and extraction of fossil fuels in Gaspesie. We accomplished a similar 700 km march in 2014 between Cacouna and Kanehsatà:ke to oppose TransCanada’s Energy East pipeline project. This time we will hit the road to protect the Gaspesie.  On the route, our objectives are to attract media attention to these ecological issues, to denounce the colonial attitude of companies and governments on unceded Mi'kmaq territory, to encourage mobilization to protect the environment, and to meet the affected communities by organizing protest shows and discussions.  Compared with other types of actions, a long march makes it possible to link different groups dispersed on the territory, to acknowledge the work of local activists and to create strong friendships. Walking also creates an attachment to the scenery, to the Earth. It plants the seeds of future actions.10 Reasons to Support the March
PROJECT BELLEDUNE: The Chaleur Terminals company is planning to bring more than 200 wagons of oil per day, from the tar sands in Alberta, through the Matapedia valley in Gaspesie up to Belledune in New-Brunswick. Populations and water are put at risk of a possible derailment like the one of Lac Megantic. This project helps the extraction of oil from tar sands in Alberta which on top of poisoning the environment and people in Alberta, is a major threat for the climate.
The three Mi’gmaq communities in Gaspesie have not been either consulted or accommodated for this project of transporting oil by train. Therefore, they oppose this violation of their treaty. Mayors of many municipalities,such as in Amqui and Rimouski,  are also opposed to the Chaleur Terminals inc. project.
Gastem is suing the village of Ristigouche-South-East, that counts 168 inhabitants, for 1.5 million dollars because they dare pass a bylaw to protect their drinking water.
In order to be profitable, oil and gas extraction in Gaspesie will require thousands of wells and the use of hydraulic fracturing, aka fracking. Even though the companies say they are not using this technique for the time being, fracking could multiply production by a factor 100. So we can expect pressure from them to authorize fracking.
Fracking consists in injecting toxic substances (e.g., potassium chloride, benzene, toluene) and about 8 million liters of water per well to break the rock deep down. Research has shown a link between hydraulic fracking and an increase in still born births as well as birth defects in newborns. Fracking has also caused earthquakes.
HALDIMAND PROJECT: Petrolia has already drilled four wells in the Haldimand area near Gaspe. They represent a threat to drinking water. Even though Haldimand-4 is at less than 150 m from a creek flowing into a salmon river, in November and December 2015 Petrolia injected 70,000 liters of fluid with 15% of hydrochloric acid in its well to clean it. GALT PROJECT: Junex has drilled wells near Gaspe and Bonaventure in the Bay of Chaleurs.
BOURQUE PROJECT: Junex and Tugliq plan to exploit many wells near Murdochville, to build a pipeline to carry natural gas to Sandy Beach harbor near Gaspe. The gas would be liquefied at the harbor and then transported by boat toward the North Shore of the St-Lawrence.
The cement factory that is being built in Port-Daniel, without proper environmental evaluation, will emit 1.75 million tons of greenhouse gases annually. It will use, as energy source, coke from the tar sands of Alberta, which is equivalent to subsidising this destructive industry.
ENERGY EAST PROJECT: If TransCanada builds the Energy East pipeline to carry 1.1 million barrels of oil per day along the St-Lawrence river, then a leak would have a terrible ecological impact on the north shore of Gaspesie.

<p>Why, you ask?</p>
<p>First off—in a nutshell—it's a lifelong dream: capture images of climate change on one of the colder populated places on the planet. Hit those spots where few people go at times when even fewer are there. Catch a glimpse of life before the firstworld grind that surrounds me today. With a geologically active landscape, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6kuls%C3%A1rl%C3%B3n"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">calving glaciers</a>, an accessible coastline, rich culture and hospitable locals, Iceland is a perfect place to tell the story of the Earth changing.  </p>
<p>I'll travel along the coast as far as weather will permit, take pictures and talk to people about how climate change as affected Iceland. What is different from 5 years ago? 10 years ago? What kinds of changes do they anticipate in the coming decade?</p>
<p>The bags are heavy, but I've got critical gear for the task at hand:</p> <ul> <li>Two full-frame camera bodies, 5 lenses, lots of filters (for shots ranging from extreme macro close-up to extreme wide to serious telephoto)</li> <li>Four strobes, portable light stands, umbrellas, softbox, seamless rolls</li> <li>Countless batteries and chargers. Sound recording unit. GPS unit. GoPro. Solar charger (although light will be a bit scarce).</li>
<li>Extreme weather clothing, sleeping bag, backpack, </li> </ul> <p>With all of this in hand, I will be flexible with my itinerary, and put safety and level-headedness above all. But it will take a little bit more than planning and good luck.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why This Trip Is Important:</h3>
<p>This is one of the last great places, and it's changing by the minute. Climate change in Iceland is causing more <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanology_of_Iceland"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">frequent volcanic eruptions</a>, faster melting of the country's glaciers, and a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/30/climate-change-lifting-iceland-volcanic-eruptions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rising of the country by up to 1.4in/year</a>. With the country changing as rapidly as it is, the people, animals, and landscape are adapting to new forces. I want to hear their stories, share them. I want to learn how a small island nation is reacting to all of the pollution that the global superpowers are sending their way every day.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I still need:</h3> <p>Essentially, I need additional funds for getting the shots once I'm there:</p> <ul> <li>rental fees for travel camper / accommodations / food</li> <li>fees for guides where necessary, helicopter or private plane rentals if possible for aerial shots</li> <li>gas money!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What I'll Get and What You'll Get</h3> <p>You'll be helping me tell this story, so let me tell you where your money will go! </p> <ul> <li>

I'm spending the month of February photographing climate change in Iceland. 
Why, you ask?
First off—in a nutshell—it's a lifelong dream: capture images of climate change on one of the colder populated places on the planet. Hit those spots where few people go at times when even fewer are there. Catch a glimpse of life before the firstworld grind that surrounds me today. With a geologically active landscape, calving glaciers, an accessible coastline, rich culture and hospitable locals, Iceland is a perfect place to tell the story of the Earth changing.  
I'll travel along the coast as far as weather will permit, take pictures and talk to people about how climate change as affected Iceland. What is different from 5 years ago? 10 years ago? What kinds of changes do they anticipate in the coming decade?
The bags are heavy, but I've got critical gear for the task at hand:  Two full-frame camera bodies, 5 lenses, lots of filters (for shots ranging from extreme macro close-up to extreme wide to serious telephoto) Four strobes, portable light stands, umbrellas, softbox, seamless rolls Countless batteries and chargers. Sound recording unit. GPS unit. GoPro. Solar charger (although light will be a bit scarce).
Extreme weather clothing, sleeping bag, backpack,   With all of this in hand, I will be flexible with my itinerary, and put safety and level-headedness above all. But it will take a little bit more than planning and good luck.

Why This Trip Is Important:
This is one of the last great places, and it's changing by the minute. Climate change in Iceland is causing more frequent volcanic eruptions, faster melting of the country's glaciers, and a rising of the country by up to 1.4in/year. With the country changing as rapidly as it is, the people, animals, and landscape are adapting to new forces. I want to hear their stories, share them. I want to learn how a small island nation is reacting to all of the pollution that the global superpowers are sending their way every day.   What I still need: Essentially, I need additional funds for getting the shots once I'm there:  rental fees for travel camper / accommodations / food fees for guides where necessary, helicopter or private plane rentals if possible for aerial shots gas money!    What I'll Get and What You'll Get You'll be helping me tell this story, so let me tell you where your money will go!   
$10 and uppays for: a tasty meal along the way!You get in return: a selfie of me toasting you at the meal, and 5 digital Iceland photograph backgrounds for your computer and/or cell phone

$75 and uppays for:  a tank of gasYou get in return: 12-pack of 4""x6"" Iceland photograph cards, professionally printed on 110# Recycled Card stock


$250 and uppays for: a night's accommodation (with a much-appreciated shower)You get: a selfie of me on-site at the accommodation you made possible, AND a single, bamboo-mounted 8""x10"" signed Iceland photograph that you choose from the trip selects 


$500 and uppays for: a week of camper rental, a guide for the day, or a short heli flightYou get: - 26 page, 16""x12"" professionally printed color book with key photos from the journey, and insights learned along the way

$1000 and uppays for: multiple helicopter flights / guide daysYou get: your choice of a single 3'x4' fine art print (framing not included) of an Iceland photo you choose from the trip selects, or four 16""x24"" fine art prints of photographs you choose from the trip selects.  


What Challenges Do I Anticipate?

  Well, this trip is chock full of 'em.  It's going to be a little cold in Iceland in February.
I don't speak Icelandic, so I'll be relying on the goodwill of the people I meet to help me along the way in English.
 
I hope to make many friends, and engage in a dialogue that will tell the story, and lead me to interesting photographs. I plan to take many portraits, landscapes, and macro images along the way, as climate change is very much about people in their environment.   Other Ways You Can Help Maybe money's not your thing, or maybe you're hesitant to give money to a guy to hit the road with a camera. But I can use other kinds of help:  Tell your friends about my campaign, get the word out in the short time I have left before I leave. Introduce me to people you know in Iceland that would like to be a part of my project, either in facilitating it, or as part of the story, or both!   Let's tell this story!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Change Makers at Sea is a fundraising campaign for the Youth & Elders Project; fostering intergenerational exchange in the quest for cultural maturity and stewardship of our planetPlotFrom June 10th to 17th, 2012 an intergenerational group of 30 change makers will set sail on a Tall Ship in the Baltic Sea.Over the course of one week, facilitated by workshops, deep conversations and the movement of the sea, the group will explore the notion of ‘cultural maturity’ in an era of global change and in the quest for a more sustainable way forward for our societies.This is a voyage of discovery to explore and clarify the unique and diverse value of being human in all stages of life; honoring that only by combining the push for change with the wisdom of maturity can we tackle the challenges of our time.
Help Float the Boat
The Youth & Elders project is gathering a small group of dedicated people that are ready to support each other, each other’s projects and each other’s passion for collectively illuminating a better future. Together we’re reaching out into the world to spark the imagination across communities, generations, cultures and countries.We are asking for $6892 - which is the equivalent of €5250, the bare minimum it takes to float the ship. For every cent you contribute we get a little bit closer to this aim! 
All contributions go to our scholarship fund that will help ensure that this experience is inclusive and that we can reach the diverse group of people needed for this exchange to ripple out into the world.If you can't support us with money, don’t worry! There are other important ways of supporting us: 

by helping us reach out to others who might endorse the project
by providing us with media coverage
by linking your important organisation to ours
by contributing your fantastic ideas, vision and drive to see Youth and Elders across the globe come together in a strong alliance for tomorrow 
Don’t hesitate. Contact us at info@youthandelders.org
About the Youth & Elders Project:
Website ( www.youthandelders.org )Facebook ( www.facebook.com/youthandelders )Twitter ( www.twitter.com/youthandelders  )
Vision
We have a vision of transcending the paradigm of expansion growth, of creatively maturing as a society and joyfully collaborating across the generations to get there.
Mision
Together we will explore the potential of intergenerational collaboration for sustainability, and seek ways in which we can step into our individual and collective brilliance.
Outcome
The conversations we have had so far are already having an impact - like ripples which spread outwards as a boat moves through the sea. We are touching friends and colleagues, and friends we haven't met yet. And they in turn are having conversations that are touching others - and the conversation expands.As circle meets circle, energies and enthusiasm combine and become the bow wave of the boat’s passage in June and we believe they will contribute to sparkling new insights in the wake of its passage.To assist in spreading the outcomes and to facilitate the community of explorers forming around the project, we are developing and assembling a suite of communications and narrative tools. Storytellers are joining our circles as well.

We are inviting a documentary film maker to join us and film the voyage.
The outcomes of this ‘journey of discovery’ will be recorded and shaped into a booklet.
Journalists are sharing our journey to increase our visibility.
We are hosting SKYPE circles with engaged, knowledgeable people from around the world to explore the different facets of youth and eldership.
These inspiring conversations are being harvested to be shared as podcasts and graphic recordings.
Our website is both an entry point and an outlet to catalyse the ongoing dialogue.
A Youth and Elders Council is being formed based on the sailing trip to inform, advise, inspire, challenge, support, critique, expand, connect and surprise us… all in turn and as needed.
This council will help shape a project that becomes an organism of its own, where future explorations take the questions and lessons of the project forward into local communities around the world.
Any excess money after we return to port will be invested in the future of a sustainable Youth & Elders initiative that can reach out in the future.

About our Boat
The boat, The Lovis, is staffed by a core group of permanent crew, including the skipper. Part of the team-building and the learning experience includes sharing duties on board, including the actual handling of the boat. Don’t worry if you’ve never been sailing before, the ship’s permanent crew is on hand to explain and teach; to quite literally ‘show you the ropes’. And they know her intimately, having rebuilt her themselves, and spending each winter on upkeep and overhauling her.“The Lovis is a social experiment chamber. She offers personal development opportunities in many directions. In addition to the content focus groups, we want to bring alive the traditional maritime experience of life on the water.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Kristen Mandala. Currently, I am in my third year at Dalhousie University studying International Development.</p>
<p>In 2009, I took my first volunteer trip to Kenya with Me to We. Since then my desire to help others in developing communities around the world has grown a hundred-fold. This summer I have been accepted on a six-week volunteer project in Peru through Operation Groundswell; an incredible non-profit organization dedicated to environmentally conscious and ethical travel in developing regions all over the world.  </p>
<p>However, being a full-time student makes the prospect of funding the trip very daunting. Any and all help is incredibly appreciated! The program asks for $1,000 to be fundraised to go towards the tools and materials we will be using on the ground in Peru. With my parents generously covering some of the remaining flights and program fee, I need to come up with the remaining money in order to go on this lifechanging experience!  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The program fee is $2,795, with flights to and from Peru anywhere between $1,000-1,500 and the additional $1,000 needing to be fundraised. </p>
<p>This trip is unique as it is adamant about emmersing oneself into the culture you're working in. No voluntourism with a safari and hotel room. We will be living like the locals in Iquitos and embracing all of the cultural wonders Peru has to offer. </p>
<p>Throughout the summer leading up to the trip I will be working full-time and fundraising in my community as well. The money raised here - even if the goal is not met - will still go towards my fundraising donation, and with my job I will hopefully be able to be apart of this amazing experience.</p>
<p>With your help, I will be able to raise the $1,000 in order to contribute to the development project in the Amazon, as well as an additional $1,000 to pay for some of my program fee and flight costs to get me there!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Throughout the trip our group will be working hand-in-hand with Asociacion Kallpa Iquitos, a non-profit organization that helps building environmentally sustainable communities in the region. The organization works with university students from Peru in creating sustainable resources like compost toilets in remote villages, water tanks with filtration systems, etc.</p>
<p>Once there, our group will be able to focus on a project that is of the most importance for the community! </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Any and all controbutions are incredibly appreciated! Even if it is so much as sharing with a friend or emailing the link - I will be forever grateful!</p></div>","Short Summary

<h3>My Connection to Mindanao</h3>
<p>In April 2011, I visited Mindanao, Philippines, as a tourist and met many friendly, local people. Just before Christmas 2011, Northern Mindanao was unexpectedly hit by a devastating typhoon (named Sendong, aka Washi). Thousands drowned and tens of thousands of homes were washed away. Government and relief organizations were slow to act. I contacted those I knew through text messages and was able to channel funds instantly through Western Union for essentials like drinking water, rice, and even coffins to bury their dead. Temporary shelters were eventually set up but many are still living in them now. Water-born disease was rife after the floods. This region will still be recovering for years.</p>
<p>In addition, Mindanao has been a neglected region of the Philippines  because of the longstanding Muslim insurgency in the southwest of the region. The separatist movement has been further inflamed by land grabs by international mining companies, backed by government troops.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>Hi, family, friends, and supporters!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My name is Erin Fagan, and I am a student at Old Dominion University in Norfolk Virginia, where I am studying marine biology/conservation, and environmental studies. I am extremely passionate about environmental conservation, and I am always on the search for opportunities to better myself, both as an activist, and as a human being.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am raising money to fund an experience which I know will prove to be irreplaceable. I am hoping to attend the Women's Environmental Leadership Retreat, in the Bay Area of California. This retreat is swiftly approaching at the end of March, therefore, I must ask for your help.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<div>When I am not in class, I dedicate a significant amount of my time, and more importantly of myself, to environmental activism, through my work as a Campus Coordinator and the Training Coordinator on the Greenpeace Student Board, an educator for the Elizabeth River Project, head of the Marine Biology Student Association's Planning and Outreach Committee, and more. I never let an opportunity pass me by!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This year, I helped to plan and execute the Second Annual Student Network Activist Convergence in Washington, D.C., and was asked to speak to various classes, both at my own college and others, about the importance of student involvement and awareness. I have met with Senators, Congressmen, and Delegates, to discuss local environmental issues and to brainstorm solutions, and after being accepted into my college's Diversity Institute, a semester-long anti-oppression and diversity training, I was invited to join the Social Entrepreneurship Council, where I have the honor of working side-by-side with social and environmental leaders in my community to spread awareness, acceptance, and empowerment, through creative solutions.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What is the Women's Environmental Leadership Retreat?</h3>
<p>The Women's Environmental Leadership Retreat, held from March 21 to March 24, is an experiential workshop which is open to women of all ages who are a part of the environmental movement.</p>
<p>Objectives of the Retreat include exploring the intersections between environmental, social, peace, and other movements, gaining a better understanding of women's roles within the environmental movement, building relationships with influential female leaders and fellow activists, learning how to make a difference and promote a just and sustainable world... and more!</p>
<p><br/>So what do I plan on doing with the skills I will gain at the Retreat? I plan on continuing to develop my leadership skills, helping me to gain confidence in myself, along with the ability to ignite excitement and passion in others, network with other activists, and promote environmental and social awareness and action. I hope to leave the retreat a more effective leader and agent of change, so that I may take my experiences as an activist to the next level.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need to Make It Happen</h3>
- $600 for airfare from Norfolk, Virginia to San Francisco, CA</div>
<div>- $250 for tuition</div>
<div>- $150 for food and additional travel costs</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am hoping to raise these funds by March 8th, so that I can purchase my plane ticket as in advance as possible.</div>
<p>It is nearly impossible for me to express my gratitude in words. Having the opportunity to attend this retreat would be both a culmination of my dedication, but also a starting point where I can truly begin to gain the skills necessary for a career in activism, so that I can dedicate my life to making a difference.</p>
<p><br/>If you are able to help me, I would like you to become a part of my journey! You can see what I mean by looking to the right side of this page.</p></div>","Note:

My name is Erin Fagan, and I am a student at Old Dominion University in Norfolk Virginia, where I am studying marine biology/conservation, and environmental studies. I am extremely passionate about environmental conservation, and I am always on the search for opportunities to better myself, both as an activist, and as a human being.
 
I am raising money to fund an experience which I know will prove to be irreplaceable. I am hoping to attend the Women's Environmental Leadership Retreat, in the Bay Area of California. This retreat is swiftly approaching at the end of March, therefore, I must ask for your help.
 
About Me
When I am not in class, I dedicate a significant amount of my time, and more importantly of myself, to environmental activism, through my work as a Campus Coordinator and the Training Coordinator on the Greenpeace Student Board, an educator for the Elizabeth River Project, head of the Marine Biology Student Association's Planning and Outreach Committee, and more. I never let an opportunity pass me by!
 
This year, I helped to plan and execute the Second Annual Student Network Activist Convergence in Washington, D.C., and was asked to speak to various classes, both at my own college and others, about the importance of student involvement and awareness. I have met with Senators, Congressmen, and Delegates, to discuss local environmental issues and to brainstorm solutions, and after being accepted into my college's Diversity Institute, a semester-long anti-oppression and diversity training, I was invited to join the Social Entrepreneurship Council, where I have the honor of working side-by-side with social and environmental leaders in my community to spread awareness, acceptance, and empowerment, through creative solutions.
 

What is the Women's Environmental Leadership Retreat?
The Women's Environmental Leadership Retreat, held from March 21 to March 24, is an experiential workshop which is open to women of all ages who are a part of the environmental movement.
Objectives of the Retreat include exploring the intersections between environmental, social, peace, and other movements, gaining a better understanding of women's roles within the environmental movement, building relationships with influential female leaders and fellow activists, learning how to make a difference and promote a just and sustainable world... and more!
So what do I plan on doing with the skills I will gain at the Retreat? I plan on continuing to develop my leadership skills, helping me to gain confidence in myself, along with the ability to ignite excitement and passion in others, network with other activists, and promote environmental and social awareness and action. I hope to leave the retreat a more effective leader and agent of change, so that I may take my experiences as an activist to the next level.

 

What I Need to Make It Happen
- $600 for airfare from Norfolk, Virginia to San Francisco, CA
- $250 for tuition
- $150 for food and additional travel costs
 
I am hoping to raise these funds by March 8th, so that I can purchase my plane ticket as in advance as possible.
It is nearly impossible for me to express my gratitude in words. Having the opportunity to attend this retreat would be both a culmination of my dedication, but also a starting point where I can truly begin to gain the skills necessary for a career in activism, so that I can dedicate my life to making a difference.
If you are able to help me, I would like you to become a part of my journey! You can see what I mean by looking to the right side of this page.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

My mission is to collaborate with E.P.I.C., Everyday People Initiating Change, to bring clean water to under developed villages in Africa. So far E.P.I.C has drilled 7 water wells. Our goal is to visit all 7 locations where they have drilled, and implement hygiene/sanitation programs.  The water wells are in Kawe, Weru, Mangalali, a village in Arusha, and two hamlets in Ugele. We will also be scouting locations for the 8th and 9th wells. Now is the perfect time for me to join the team because E.P.I.C is looking to expand the hygiene/sanitation programs to include health and nutrition. I was asked to volunteer to help build out a nutrition program to educate the locals on food to improve and extend their quality of life. I have been involved with this charity since 2006 and have helped E.P.I.C fund raise for each of the 7 wells they have drilled. This is a grassroots organization and 100 per cent of the donations go directly to the cause so I have decided to ask for a bit of financial support. </p>
<p>We have a film crew joining us to document every step of our trip hoping to raise awareness of the tremendous injustice plaguing the developing world.  Did you know that their are still 1.1 Billion People in the world who do not have access to clean water?   And every day 4,000 children are affected by water related diseases.</p>
<p>By supporting me on my journey to Tanzania, I hope to raise consciousness to the real problems crippling the developing world: disease, lack of access to basic needs, poor nutrition and unnecessary death. This cause is extremely important to me because we are so fortunate to have access to organic foods and clean water when in some villages in Tanzania the locals have to walk 7 miles to collect 1 bucket of <strong>DIRTY</strong> water or wait one hour to get 1 bucket of water from a puddle.  </p>
<p><strong>Water Facts -There are still 1.1 billion people in the world who do not have access to clean drinking water. 1.8 million children die every year as a result of diseases caused by unclean water and poor sanitation - this amounts to around 5000 deaths a day.

<h2><span>The world is facing two major crises</span></h2>
<h2><span>Oh No What Are They?</span></h2>
<h2><span>Peak oil and climate change.</span></h2>
<h2><span>Are we doomed? Is there a hero who can save us?</span></h2>
<h2><span>Yes there is, it’s the members of Transition Towns. </span></h2>
<h3><span>TRANSITION TOWNS, WHAT ARE THEY?</span></h3>
<p><span>Transition Towns are community groups with an environmental heart. There are Transition Towns all over the world carrying out amazing initiatives to bring their community together and help the planet at the same time. This is what makes them superheroes. They want to make their communities more resilient and sustainable and to combat climate change and peak oil rather then contribute to it. Rob Hopkins the creator of the Transition Network believed that by regarding both issues in unison using grassroots initiatives real change could be made. There are thousands of Transition Initiatives being carried out on a daily basis, they range from community supported agriculture, community allotments, pedal power cinemas, reskilling festivals, and that’s just to name a few. They implement fun and creative ways to make their communities more resilient and thus lowering any negatives impact on the planet.</span></p>
<h3><span>THESE CRISES, HOW BAD ARE THEY? </span></h3>
<p><span>We know the world is facing an environmental crisis and this is affecting so many of us personally, professionally, financially and mentally. We have seen snow in May, houses and lives ruined to flooding, farm animals dying and this is just on our small island, never mind the catastrophes facing the world around us and the resultant climate change refugees that need to flee their homes and livlihoods. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at a record high and this is causing changes to our weather patterns and climate, much of which is disastrous. Peak oil is another major issue, oil levels are dropping while oil demand is growing. We cannot continue on like this. While some of us panic and shout ‘what can be done?’ many people like transition town members are working on projects that have a positive impact on our local and global communities.</span></p>
<h3><span>WHAT CAN THIS CAMPAIGN DO?</span></h3>
<p><span>Our campaign is to create and run ‘Recognising Resilience – The Transition Awards’ an awards ceremony to recognise and reward transition initiatives in Ireland. Transition Towns bring together communities and work on resilient solutions. Many of these solutions and their impacts go unnoticed so we want to set up an awards ceremony to recognise the great work of these initiatives and show our appreciation and mobilise more Transition Initiatives to be carried out. The overall winner of the awards will have a documentary produced about their community and Transition Initiatives. The awards and ceremony will be used to spread the word about these community and environmental heroes. In these times of economic hardship we want to turn recession in to resilience and bring some joy and hope back to the Irish people.   </span></p>
<h3><span>WHO IS RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN?</span></h3>
<p>This campaign is being run by Elaine Doyle, Olwyn Roche and the facilitators of TINI (Transition Ireland and Northern Ireland). We are all passionate about community, resilience, sustainable development and believe that the power of people through collaboration can make real change in the world. Elaine is an engineer and Olwyn is an architect and while both these women have technical brains, they have green hearts and an entrepreneurial spirit. Both are really excited to run this campaign to raise money to run an awards show that will recognise the heroes of Transition Initiatives that often go unnoticed and to put their stories on film in the ‘Recognising Resilience Documentary’. Irish people are born and bred on stories and we want to bring the stories of the Transition members in Ireland to other Irish people and the world.</p>
<h3><span>MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, WHERE WILL THE DONATIONS GO?</span></h3>
<p><span>We are looking to raise €10,000. This money will be used to create and run the awards in Dublin, secure prizes for the winners including making a documentary to further promote and highlight their Transition Initiatives and community. As a small treat for you donors out there we have some fun perks. Our perks range from donations of €1 to €10,000. We aim to accommodate all pockets. Our perks vary from happy thoughts being sent out from our team, to handwritten cards, tree planting, an executive producer title on the documentary to having an award named after you for a year at the ‘Recognising Resilience – The Transition Awards’. We picked our perks to make you smile and make the planet smile. We are aiming to raise €10,000, splitting the money between creating and hosting the awards and making the documentary. In the case that we don’t reach our target we will alter the size of the awards and documentary to suit our budget.</span></p>
<h3><span>OH OH I'VE NO MONEY, CAN I STILL HELP?</span></h3>
<p><span>We understand that not everyone has finances to donate to this campaign. We ask you to check all your pockets and under your couch for even €1 to donate (you will get a happy thought in return), if you find nothing there we still have a small job for you.  Transition Initiatives are all about stories, great positive stories, something we need as much of the world is consumed with economic crisis and the entire planet is in an environmental crisis. We want you to help us spread these stories, stories about this campaign, about the ‘Recognising Resilience awards’ and about Transition Initiatives and the Transition Network. Even better then spreading stories, we want you to take action, set up your own Transition Initiatives and make a difference to the planet both for your neighbours next door and on the other side of the world. We want you to become a better local and global citizen.</span></p>
<h3><span>AND FINALLY….</span></h3>
<p><span>People power and resilience are the real assets we have to make changes at a local and global level for people, economy and the environment, all facets of sustainable development. Transition Initiatives are being carried out all over the world on a daily basis and we want to run the awards to let the superstars of the Irish initiatives have their day and allow them a platform for their amazing and contributory work to be recognised. Each of us is part of a local community and we all play a part as global citizens in the global community. The awards and documentary will not only recognise the great work being carried out by Transition Initiatives in Ireland at present but encourage others to set up their own initiatives and inspire Ireland to become a whole island of Transition Initiatives. From there we want to inspire the world to set up even more Transition Initiatives to become more resilient and therefore happier. We’re looking to put a smile on your face and on the face of the planet. </span></p>

Farm yields have increased. 3700 tons of waste has been diverted from the Beira dump and put back into the soil. <strong>We know this works !!!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Terra Nova meets the triple bottom line:</strong></h2>
<p>1.<strong>Environment</strong>: Diverts organic waste and makes it into valuable compost for small farmers who use it to increase the long term quality of their soil and reduce dependence on chemical inputs, while reducing methane gas emissions.</p>
<p>2.<strong>Economic</strong>: Earns enough money to sustain the business without aid within 30 months.</p>
<p>3.<strong>Social Justice</strong>: Employs with dignity the people who used to glean the dump barehanded.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/856384/pictures/full/20130607051519-plant_in_sun.jpg?1370607330"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>Now we need temporary help with cash flow in order to scale up and keep the work going until promised funding from Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BAGC), a regional institution, arrives in March 2014. We project that we will break even in March 2015 and, (provided we can secure an annual operating loan), become self-sustaining.  </p>
<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>I'm a Frenchwoman named Roura Flore who moved to Madagascar in 2003 where I became passionate about my idea to employ the very poor, help the environment, and keep local farms strong. I had a technical degree in soil science and agriculture, and a master’s in program coordination from France, but needed to understand business and marketing in Africa - so I earned an MBA in Madagascar.  In 2008 I moved to this port city of Beira in Mozambique with my two small daughters and started Terra Nova. </p>
<p>Our management team is myself, Gildo Ussene in charge of sales, and Hermenegildo Dovelin charge of production. We three have been together from the beginning and my job is now mostly coordination, marketing strategy and financial management. We employ up to 30 people when in full production at our facility at the dump close to where they live.</p>
<p>The municipality of Beira is also our partner. We have a ten-year, no-cost agreement from them to divert mostly organic trash to our site and they buy our compost for city plantings. They have helped providing buildings and sanitary facilities where we provide safety clothing to our staff. </p>
<p>The BAGC this week provided funding for us to create a research and demonstration farm to show the benefits of compost.</p>
<h2>Why do we need your money now?</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/847726/pictures/full/20130603075753-TN_photo28.jpg?1370271477"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Terra Nova need short time cash money to keep employing the poorest people in Mozambique and create compost from trash for local farmers until we get promised funds in March 2014.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are more than 1000 market farmers within 30 kilometers of Beira. They typically farm less than 1/2 a hectare and grow pretty much the same set of vegetables, often in rotation with rice. Multiple traders come out to the farm to buy product by the plot or per kilo. We have very good data about who these farmers are, where they are located, and what they are doing now about fertility. </p>
<p>They now use nearly raw cow manure and sometimes use synthetic fertilizer on the sandy soil. Most of the nutrients are washed away annually. They have not tried compost and still don’t know its benefits. <strong>We decided to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">show</span> them how compost can increase yield, improve soil texture, save water, reduce weeds and pests, and build humus and structure year after year. <br/></strong></p>
<p>In two months we delivered 32 tons of compost in 25 kilo bags to farmers <br/>as<br/>a trial offer and we are now delivering to them 32 more tons of compost at 65% below our production costs or about what they pay for cow manure so they could see for themselves how it works. We kept good records about who<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/847748/pictures/full/20130603080542-TN_photo49.jpg?1370271945"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> used it. The results are very promising so far. The farmers can now see how <br/>much their income will increase and can justify paying more for compost over manure. We are confident we have a market for 3000 tons of manure starting in March 2016 at slightly above our production costs. </p>
<p>However we gave away too much of our inventory and did not sell as much as we hoped to urban gardeners. We don't have enough cash for the next few months to produce enough compost to meet the demand we have generated.</p>
<p>Your money will provide us the extra $3500 per month we need through March to keep us in production until an expected grant from the regional development program kicks in. We know now that we will need an annual operating loan soon so we can cope with the production and seasonal demand cycles. Right now we need your contribution to keep the doors open. </p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Do you have a webpage?</strong> – No. Until now this has been an almost entirely local effort. No one we work with use computers and this is the first time we have sought attention from the “outside world”. We would love some help in getting a website set up and some instructions about how to maintain it. </p>
<p><strong>How can I learn more about Terra Nova?</strong> – You can contact me directly or if you are in the US you can contact David Visher who is here helping me with this campaign as a volunteer in the Farmer-to-Farmer program funded by USAID. He will be back home on July 1.</p>
<p><strong>Is the compost safe for crops and people?</strong> – Yes. We follow best practice in its production and monitor temperature carefully to assure that pathogens are destroyed. Our team wears protective clothing when working with the materiel. Our product is tested regularly to make sure it is safe for the farmers’ soil. We are working to manage slightly high results in salt and copper. Because the compost is made from urban waste it cannot be certified Organic. Of course there are no Organic farms here.</p>
<p><strong>What is your biggest challenge?</strong> – The farmers perceive compost as an alternative to less expensive raw cow manure. It is a challenge to explain that it is an entirely different thing. Normal branding and positioning strategies make little sense to a diverse, illiterate, cash strapped population who have been misled by outsiders many times in the past. Our strategy is to <em>show</em> then it works by giving them nearly free samples, but we undercapitalized that effort. We are also challenged by the high cost of operating capital; it takes three to five months to make compost for farmers who predictably demand it during three peak periods. We need either a cash reserve or an expensive operating loan.</p>

<p>J’espère que d’une manière ou d’une autre vous pourrez nous aider et vous en remercie d’avance.</p></div>","Terra Nova employs the poorest people in Mozambique to create compost from organic waste so small farmers can grow more crops.  We have made 600 tons of compost over three years and distributed it to 1000 small farmers already while employing up to 30 people from the dump. Farm yields have increased. 3700 tons of waste has been diverted from the Beira dump and put back into the soil. We know this works !!!
Terra Nova meets the triple bottom line:
1.Environment: Diverts organic waste and makes it into valuable compost for small farmers who use it to increase the long term quality of their soil and reduce dependence on chemical inputs, while reducing methane gas emissions.
2.Economic: Earns enough money to sustain the business without aid within 30 months.
3.Social Justice: Employs with dignity the people who used to glean the dump barehanded.
Now we need temporary help with cash flow in order to scale up and keep the work going until promised funding from Beira Agricultural Growth Corridor (BAGC), a regional institution, arrives in March 2014. We project that we will break even in March 2015 and, (provided we can secure an annual operating loan), become self-sustaining.  
Who are we?
I'm a Frenchwoman named Roura Flore who moved to Madagascar in 2003 where I became passionate about my idea to employ the very poor, help the environment, and keep local farms strong. I had a technical degree in soil science and agriculture, and a master’s in program coordination from France, but needed to understand business and marketing in Africa - so I earned an MBA in Madagascar.  In 2008 I moved to this port city of Beira in Mozambique with my two small daughters and started Terra Nova. 
Our management team is myself, Gildo Ussene in charge of sales, and Hermenegildo Dovelin charge of production. We three have been together from the beginning and my job is now mostly coordination, marketing strategy and financial management. We employ up to 30 people when in full production at our facility at the dump close to where they live.
The municipality of Beira is also our partner. We have a ten-year, no-cost agreement from them to divert mostly organic trash to our site and they buy our compost for city plantings. They have helped providing buildings and sanitary facilities where we provide safety clothing to our staff. 
The BAGC this week provided funding for us to create a research and demonstration farm to show the benefits of compost.
Why do we need your money now?

Terra Nova need short time cash money to keep employing the poorest people in Mozambique and create compost from trash for local farmers until we get promised funds in March 2014.
 
There are more than 1000 market farmers within 30 kilometers of Beira. They typically farm less than 1/2 a hectare and grow pretty much the same set of vegetables, often in rotation with rice. Multiple traders come out to the farm to buy product by the plot or per kilo. We have very good data about who these farmers are, where they are located, and what they are doing now about fertility. 
They now use nearly raw cow manure and sometimes use synthetic fertilizer on the sandy soil. Most of the nutrients are washed away annually. They have not tried compost and still don’t know its benefits. We decided to show them how compost can increase yield, improve soil texture, save water, reduce weeds and pests, and build humus and structure year after year. 
In two months we delivered 32 tons of compost in 25 kilo bags to farmers asa trial offer and we are now delivering to them 32 more tons of compost at 65% below our production costs or about what they pay for cow manure so they could see for themselves how it works. We kept good records about who used it. The results are very promising so far. The farmers can now see how much their income will increase and can justify paying more for compost over manure. We are confident we have a market for 3000 tons of manure starting in March 2016 at slightly above our production costs. 
However we gave away too much of our inventory and did not sell as much as we hoped to urban gardeners. We don't have enough cash for the next few months to produce enough compost to meet the demand we have generated.
Your money will provide us the extra $3500 per month we need through March to keep us in production until an expected grant from the regional development program kicks in. We know now that we will need an annual operating loan soon so we can cope with the production and seasonal demand cycles. Right now we need your contribution to keep the doors open. 
What have we done so far?
2009  Beginning of the pilot recycling waste project
2009  Formation of the company Terra Nova
2010  Partnership with Beira municipality and Gevalor a French organization that is composting waste in Madagascar and helps to develop this kind of project in Africa
2010  Award from Initiatives of Green Business in Mozambique for the Terra Nova business plan
2010 – 2013 Participation in educational, environmental and commercial fairs and various speeches to governmental institutions and associations about the necessity to recycle waste and to sustainably improve the fertility of agricultural soils.
2011  Recycling of 2500 tons of municipal waste into 350 tons of compost and hiring 30 people
2012  Terra Nova ranked within the 100 best Small and Medium Entreprises (SME) of Mozambique
2012  On farm demonstration that compost from Terra Nova can increase crop yields by 15% to 70%
2013  Marketing campaign to demonstrate these benefits in rural areas and provide compost to 1000 famers

FAQ
Do you have a webpage? – No. Until now this has been an almost entirely local effort. No one we work with use computers and this is the first time we have sought attention from the “outside world”. We would love some help in getting a website set up and some instructions about how to maintain it. 
How can I learn more about Terra Nova? – You can contact me directly or if you are in the US you can contact David Visher who is here helping me with this campaign as a volunteer in the Farmer-to-Farmer program funded by USAID. He will be back home on July 1.
Is the compost safe for crops and people? – Yes. We follow best practice in its production and monitor temperature carefully to assure that pathogens are destroyed. Our team wears protective clothing when working with the materiel. Our product is tested regularly to make sure it is safe for the farmers’ soil. We are working to manage slightly high results in salt and copper. Because the compost is made from urban waste it cannot be certified Organic. Of course there are no Organic farms here.
What is your biggest challenge? – The farmers perceive compost as an alternative to less expensive raw cow manure. It is a challenge to explain that it is an entirely different thing. Normal branding and positioning strategies make little sense to a diverse, illiterate, cash strapped population who have been misled by outsiders many times in the past. Our strategy is to show then it works by giving them nearly free samples, but we undercapitalized that effort. We are also challenged by the high cost of operating capital; it takes three to five months to make compost for farmers who predictably demand it during three peak periods. We need either a cash reserve or an expensive operating loan.

<h3>""Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all!""</h3>
<h3>The Love Story</h3>
<p>Meet Lee and Outdoors.<br/>The year was 2003, having survived the Y2K outbreak a few years earlier, Lee and Outdoors had lived their whole life without the knowledge of each other's existence. In a magical place call the BWCA, located beyond the city skyline where there existed only nature and the lakes filled the horizon, it was the making of a fateful encounter. It was love at first sight...Actually, love after a week. It was Lee's first experience camping, canoeing, and portaging through her participation in YMCA Camp Menogyn's 8-day canoe trip. The sound of loons, sleeping under the stars, watching the sun set while eating mac and cheese, gliding across the lake, carrying canoes, and breathing in the fresh air; these were all experiences that spark a lifelong love. A love that continues to be irrepacable, indescribable, and fulfilling. </p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Lee Vue, a college graduate from the University of MN-Twin Cities with a BA in Political Science. I am Hmong-American, spicy food addict, photographer, and loves to travel. I'm always seeking a new adventure that will add to my learning, love and passion for the environment and outdoors, and to make a difference in my community (and world).</p>
<h3>The 2013 Adventure of a Lifetime</h3>
<p>This September, Paddle Forward will embark on and film a three-month long canoe journey down the Mississippi River from the headwaters in Lake Itasca, Minnesota, to New Orleans. As we paddle, we will engage communities in an ongoing dialogue about their relationships to and interactions with this watertrail to give voice to the Mississippi River, its inhabitants, and the many perspectives we encounter along the way. Upon completion of the trip, we will produce a documentary of this journey so that these vital conversations can continue with others beyond the flow of the river.</p>
<h3>
<strong>Why Paddle the Mississippi?</strong> </h3>
<p>As the climate debate comes to a head in the United States, it’s easy to get caught up in abstract political jargon and lose sight of the everyday people whose lives revolve around the health of a natural resource. I love paddling rivers that encompass an array of social and environmental issues because they tell a great story. One that needs to be heard.<br/><br/>A personal reason that I want to be part of this paddle is that I want to inspire others that they can follow their passions wholeheartedly. As a Hmong-American woman, I especially want to empower young girls of color that they can change the world one adventure at a time. It's not everyday that we hear stories about a Hmong women doing unbelieveable things especially involving the outdoors. I want to change the status quo -- Dream to become explorers, adventurers, movers and shakers, and expeditioners.</p>

<h3>The Mobile Permaculture Lab -Taking Permaculture on the Road.</h3>
<p>The Mobile Permaculture Lab is a project of the permaculture non profit, Permatecture Design.</p>
<p>Our converted permaculture school bus is designed with a temporary solar panel installation, water catchment, aquaponics, and an herb shop. The bus is designed as a mobile permaculture education vehicle, that is headed west to teach mobile permaculture education. The on board seed shop, garden laboratory, and apothecary allow our teachers to stop anywhere and set up workshops! We are taking permaculture on the road, heading west for fall wildcrafting season, and creating herbal products along the way.</p>
<p>We need your help to fund our education program by helping us complete the bus design! Our missing pieces include - veggie oil conversion, competion of solar installation, and the installation of our wood burning stove!</p>
<p>When we return east this spring we will bring back herbs and medicinals, and new knowledge to teach and share. Long term, we intend to utilize the Mobile Permaculture Lab as a teaching tool for children and adults, and as a mobile project support vehicle.</p>

<h3>Why Mobile Permaculture Education Matters.</h3>
<p>The Mobile Permaculture Lab allows us to travel throughout the US teaching permaculture to schools, programs, farms and gardens. Along the way we will be provided the opportunity to both teach permaculture and lead project based workshops, we will have the opportunity to connect local permaculture efforts together, expanding the national permaculture practitioner and teacher web.</p>
<p>Education should be free, and it should make sense. The Mobile Permaculture Lab allows us the opportunity to reskill our population through practical application &amp; permaculture experience.</p>
<p>As we travel, we will be creating seed balls of wildflowers for bees, milkweed for butterflies, and edibles for humans, and throwing them to replant pollinator pathways across America, marking our travels!</p>

The Mobile Permaculture Lab is a project of the permaculture non profit, Permatecture Design.
Our converted permaculture school bus is designed with a temporary solar panel installation, water catchment, aquaponics, and an herb shop. The bus is designed as a mobile permaculture education vehicle, that is headed west to teach mobile permaculture education. The on board seed shop, garden laboratory, and apothecary allow our teachers to stop anywhere and set up workshops! We are taking permaculture on the road, heading west for fall wildcrafting season, and creating herbal products along the way.
We need your help to fund our education program by helping us complete the bus design! Our missing pieces include - veggie oil conversion, competion of solar installation, and the installation of our wood burning stove!
When we return east this spring we will bring back herbs and medicinals, and new knowledge to teach and share. Long term, we intend to utilize the Mobile Permaculture Lab as a teaching tool for children and adults, and as a mobile project support vehicle.


Why We Need Cash Bucks.
We Need Funds For ...
VEGGIE OIL CONVERSION - $1500.00
SOLAR PANEL - $500.00
All funds raised will be put towards veggie oil conversion and solar panel installation completion. We thank you for your donations! As a thank you, you can receive a number of permaculture perks :)

Arrivati a San Paulo a fine gennaio 2016 ci muoveremo per quattro mesi per il sud del Brasile, verso la regione argentina di Misiones, per arrivare in Paraguay ed infine in Bolivia. Lì incontreremo ONG, associazioni, scuole ecologiche popolari, collettivi o singole persone impegnate quotidianamente in pratiche ecologiche e sostenibili. Conosceremo chi si occupa di:<p></p>
<ul>
<li>agricoltura sostenibile, agro-ecologia e permacultura;</li>
<li>diritto all'acqua e alla terra;</li>
<li>sovranità alimentare ed alimentazione cosciente;</li>
<li>recupero di spazi urbani abbandonati per creare orti pubblici;</li>
</ul>ma anche chi contribuisce, tramite media, scrittura e varie forme artistiche, alla sensibilizzazione verso modi di vivere più conviviali e rispettosi delle persone e dell'ambiente. <b>Soprattutto condivideremo la loro quotidianità: ascoltando, imparando, facendo e vivendo. Questa esperienza non sarà solo nostra, ma anche <i>tua</i></b><i> </i>perché tutto ciò verrà documentato in un blog foto-narrativo che seguirà contemporaneamente il nostro viaggio e le esperienze condivise.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<h3>Who we are and what we will do</h3>
<div><span>Hi! These are Giulia and Michal, young linguists and anthropologists who have decided to undertake a more self-sufficient and sustainable life. We got kind of obsessed about the idea that human relationships and relations with the environment are intertwined and here we are as Echoes of Ecologies: our independent, as in organised totally by ourselves, research project in South America. We'll be in Sao Paulo at the end of January 2016, from the south of Brasil we'll travel for four months going through the Argentinian region of Misiones, towards Paraguay and Bolivia at last. We will meet NGOs, associations, popular ecological schools, collectives and single people daily engaged in ecological and sustainable practices. Particularly who deals with:</span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<ul>
<li>sustainable agriculture, agroecology and permaculture;</li>
<li>water and land rights;</li>
<li>food sovereignty and conscious nutrition;</li>
<li>reappropriation of abandoned urban spaces to create public gardens;</li>
</ul>
<p>but also who contributes, through the media, writing and various artistic forms to raise awareness about ways of living that are more convivial and respectful of people and the environment. <b>Especially, we'll share their life on a daily basis: listening, learning, doing and living. </b><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">This won't be just our experience, but also <i>yours</i> </b>because everything will be documented in a photo-narrative blog that will follow our travel and shared experiences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
Your

not finish at the end of the journey, actually it'll mark  the
beginning of a wider circle of awareness actions.</p>

Lì incontreremo ONG, associazioni, scuole ecologiche popolari, collettivi o singole persone impegnate quotidianamente in pratiche ecologiche e sostenibili. Conosceremo chi si occupa di:

agricoltura sostenibile, agro-ecologia e permacultura;

recupero di spazi urbani abbandonati per creare orti pubblici;
ma anche chi contribuisce, tramite media, scrittura e varie forme artistiche, alla sensibilizzazione verso modi di vivere più conviviali e rispettosi delle persone e dell'ambiente. Soprattutto condivideremo la loro quotidianità: ascoltando, imparando, facendo e vivendo. Questa esperienza non sarà solo nostra, ma anche tua perché tutto ciò verrà documentato in un blog foto-narrativo che seguirà contemporaneamente il nostro viaggio e le esperienze condivise.

Il seme è stata piantato. Aiutaci a far germogliare la pianta!
Le nostre necessità e le vostre ricompense
 Abbiamo già i biglietti aerei, anche l'assicurazione medica (facciamo le corna!) e i vaccini. Secondo i nostri calcoli ci servono 3000 euro in due per percorrere all'incirca 8 mila chilometri andata e ritorno, in quattro mesi, usando il trasporto pubblico! Aiutateci ad iniziare questo progetto di vita, per il resto ci arrangeremo!





Durante questo tempo ci potrete seguire giorno per giorno dal nostro blog dedicato alla divulgazione delle pratiche di esistenza/resistenza che conosceremo.   Andate già a visitarlo per vedere la lista delle associazioni che hanno già appoggiato la nostra idea e che non vedono l'ora di riceverci! Il nostro non sarà un itinerario fisso, ma cambierà se lungo il percorso troveremo altri luoghi o persone interessanti da incontrare per raccontarvelo!


Il
vostro sostegno verrà ricompensato con il nostro immenso affetto,
oltre a delle piccole sorprese personalizzate che prepareremo per voi
in segno di riconoscenza!
L'impatto


Echoes of Ecologies sono gli echi delle ecologie che ascolteremo in Sud America. Ecologie intese come relazioni tra gli esseri umani e l'ambiente. Tutte queste voci le riporteremo a casa con noi e da voi. Ma non finisce qui! La nostra testimonianza delle tematiche ambientali e sociali, le problematiche e le risposte locali legate ad esse, non sarà solo importante per informare, ma al nostro rientro contribuirà a sensibilizzare in maniera pratica mostrando che le possibilità per una maggiore convivialità, tra le persone nell'ambiente, esistono.
Noi ci impegneremo a seguire e diffondere le vie della sostenibilità sociale ed ecologica che avremo appreso. Crediamo in questo progetto! E tu?


Vuoi impegnarti anche tu?
Sappiamo che non tutti potrete aiutarci economicamente, ma se siete appassionati non significa che non vi possiate impegnare.
Chiunque può mandare il link della nostra campagna e del nostro blog a chi pensa possa interessarsi al progetto.
Se inoltre credete di conoscere qualcuno occupato nelle pratiche che affronteremo, nei luoghi che visiteremo, fatevi vivi e scriveteci pure! Grazie a tutti!

Giulia e Michal
Siamo tutti echi delle ecologie!

Who we are and what we will do
Hi! These are Giulia and Michal, young linguists and anthropologists who have decided to undertake a more self-sufficient and sustainable life. We got kind of obsessed about the idea that human relationships and relations with the environment are intertwined and here we are as Echoes of Ecologies: our independent, as in organised totally by ourselves, research project in South America. We'll be in Sao Paulo at the end of January 2016, from the south of Brasil we'll travel for four months going through the Argentinian region of Misiones, towards Paraguay and Bolivia at last. We will meet NGOs, associations, popular ecological schools, collectives and single people daily engaged in ecological and sustainable practices. Particularly who deals with:


sustainable agriculture, agroecology and permaculture;
water and land rights;
food sovereignty and conscious nutrition;
reappropriation of abandoned urban spaces to create public gardens;

but also who contributes, through the media, writing and various artistic forms to raise awareness about ways of living that are more convivial and respectful of people and the environment. Especially, we'll share their life on a daily basis: listening, learning, doing and living. This won't be just our experience, but also yours because everything will be documented in a photo-narrative blog that will follow our travel and shared experiences.


Your
contribution is fundamental for our project to get started! It will
not finish at the end of the journey, actually it'll mark  the
beginning of a wider circle of awareness actions.


The seed has been planted. Help us make the plant sprout!

What you can give us and what we can offer

We
already have the plane tickets, medical insurance (let's hope for
best!) and the vaccinations. According to our calculations we will
need 3000 euros for the two of us to cover around 8000 kilometres
both ways, during four months, using public transport!

Help
us start this life project, we'll sort out the rest! 








During
this period you may follow us day by day on our blog dedicated to
spread the word about the practices of existence/resistance that
we'll discover. Visit our blog now to see
the list of associations that already sustain our ideas and can't wait to
receive us! Ours won't be a fixed itinerary, but it may change in
case we find other interesting places or individuals to meet along
the way for us to tell you!


Your
support will be rewarded with our immense affection, plus our little
personalised surprises that we'll prepare for you as a gratitude
symbol!

The impact
Echoes of Ecologies are the echoes that we will listen to in South America. Ecologies intended as relations between humans and the environment. All of these voices we'll bring back home with us and to you. But it doesn't stop here! Our testimony about environmental and social matters - their related problems and local solutions - won't just be important to inform, but back home it will contribute to raise awareness through practical manners in order to show that possibilities for a more convivial life, between humans among the environment, actually exist. 


We will put  effort in disclosing the routes of social and ecological sustainability that we will have learnt. We believe in this project! And you?
Wanna get involved?
We understand that not all of you can help us economically, but if you are passionate about the topic it doesn't mean you cannot get involved.
Anyone can post the link to our campaign and blog, or send them to whoever might be interested in our project.
Moreover, if you happen to know anyone engaged in the practices we'll deal with, in the places we'll visit, do not hesitate to get in touch with us! Thanks to all of you!

<h3><b>Drone Aircraft</b></h3>
<p>Air Shepherd  is drone agnostic - we want the best aircraft
that we can find for the job at hand. Drone design is advancing very quickly so
we are constantly evaluating different platforms and we have designed our
approach to be adaptable to the most capable emerging technology. Currently,
based on testing in various environments, our partners in South Africa fly custom
designed UAV’s that include  fixed wing
and multi-rotor airframes of varying capability. </p>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Every drone has a solid-state inertial system that maintains its flying attitude, regardless of winds, etc.  Each has an internal GPS receiver that tells the aircraft where it is (and where the cameras are looking) at all times. At least two zooming camera systems are carried on gyro-stabilized gimbals, which keep the cameras pointing at the same location, regardless of bumpy air or heading changes.  One camera is designed for visible light and is operated during the daytime; the other is an infrared sensing device that provides thermal imaging during hours of darkness. </span>
</div>On-board datalink communications keep the aircraft in touch with the Ground Control System, sending navigation, piloting and camera operation instructions up to the aircraft and downlinking positional and live video streams from the camera systems.

<li>Accessories such as antennae, batteries and

<p></p>
<p>The Province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa is home to multiple rhino reserves, under the management of Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife (Ezemvelo). Combined, these reserves are the custodians of  approximately 2,500 rhinos. The region possesses the rhino population with the farthest reaching genetic pool. In order to ensure the viability of future populations, the protection of rhino from this region is of critical importance and will impact on all future population growth efforts. which are extremely vulnerable to poaching syndicates.</p>
<p>From an operational perspective, Ezemvelo is the ideal environment in which to utilize new technologies such as UAVs to enhance anti-poaching efforts, as rhino and other wildlife populations are contained within multiple small and manageable conservation areas.</p>
<p>Ezemvelo, in association with Peace Parks Foundation, has for the past couple of years deployed drones on a trial basis to test the capability of an assortment of UAV technologies as instruments to support anti-poaching operations in varying environmental and operational conditions. So far the project has had positive impact, and the presence of UAVs in the reserves has been instrumental in disrupting illegal activities in general.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b>Air Shepherd has committed to join Ezemvelo and Peace Parks Foundation and combine years of experience and skills in a collaborative effort to maximize the use of drone technology at the frontlines of the poaching war.</b></p>

<h3><b>A History of UAVs in
EKZNW</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>In 2012, with the onset of the rapid
increase in wildlife crime and specifically rhino poaching, EKZNW entered into
an agreement with a service provider to undertake a pilot rhino security aerial
surveillance and monitoring project using UAVs. The main objective was to
reduce rhino poaching attempts and provide effective protection of the
Hluhluwe, iMfolozi Park (HiP) rhino population.</p>
<p>This project continued for a period of two years, and the mortality statistics from start to termination of the project clearly showed a significant decrease in poaching mortalities: a 65% reduction in rhino poaching compared to the previous year. Since that time UAV tactics have been upgraded resulting in no poaching 
deaths in any area where drones were flying in the last six months.
<br/></p>

The decrease in poaching is greatly attributed to the presence of drones in the park, combined with other strategic law enforcement and monitoring projects and operations.  <br/><br/><h3>Many countries are calling for help <br/>
</h3>The poaching problem is widespread, and the word is getting out about
our success. Already seven countries across Africa have approached our team

<p>Most countries need multiple Air Shepherd teams to
fully cover all of the opportunities that are being presented to us. As a result, we will
require 45-50 teams, which is our mid-range goal: to rapidly proliferate our
capability across Africa and dramatically reduce big-time poaching. </p>

<p>Peace Parks Foundation (PPF) was founded by Nelson Mandela, Dr Anton Rupert and Prince Bernard of the Netherlands in 1997 to facilitate the establishment of transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) in southern Africa. Today, the overall objective of PPF is to facilitate and co-ordinate the establishment and development of TFCAs that have the potential of safe-guarding the integrity of biological diversity, whilst at the same time contributing to the development of shared economic benefits and poverty alleviation.</p>
<p>The Foundation has a number of focus areas, including the development of the region’s TFCAs, community development projects in and around those areas, training wildlife managers at the Southern African Wildlife College, training in hospitality and in tracking skills at the SA College for Tourism, facilitating research and experimental work on animal diseases at the Hans Hoheisen Wildlife Research Station, and combatting wildlife crime. Given the trans-national nature of wildlife crime, the region’s peace parks are playing a crucial role in combatting it as countries jointly counter the onslaught across national borders and work towards harmonizing policies and legislation.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p align=""left""><b>

• Is anyone else successfully flying drones in anti-poaching missions?</b>  No.  We are the only organization on the continent that we are aware of that has a significant, sustained, successful drone-based anti-poaching program.  We have been quietly operating and evaluating with over 600 missions, so know this works. Other groups have tested drones in short trials, but have not been successful.<br/><br/><b>• Do your drones have guns or missiles on them?</b> No. These are small drones with sophisticated cameras. They are designed for surveillance and protection, not destruction.  </p>
<p align=""left""><b>• How big are your drones?</b> They are fixed-wing aircraft that look like large airplanes, but have wingspans of approximately 2 meters or 6 feet.</p>
<p align=""left""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">• Who supplies your drones?</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">Currently, a South African based UAV company,  has custom designed and manufactured the UAV’s used in pilot programs for the last two years. But we are testing many different types of drones to determine which ones will work best in the different situations and terrain where we will fly in the future.</span><br/></p>
<p align=""left""><b>• Is this stuff complicated?</b>  Yes.  It takes four months to properly train crew members who are deploy in the field.  Significant time and dedication is required to learn to operate and maintain the aircraft, interpret what is being sent back from the aircraft, and master the mission requirements.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>• Where do your people come from?</b>  We are committed to hiring and training local people.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>• How long do the drones fly? </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">The aircraft average about two hours per battery. When the battery is low, they are brought back, a new battery is plugged in, and they are re-launched.  The batteries are recharged in the mobile control vehicle.</span></p>
<p align=""left""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">• How long will it take to put a new team in the field once the funding is available? </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;""> It takes approximately two months to hire crew, acquire aircraft and vehicles, and begin the training process. </span></p>
<p align=""left""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">• Do you need permission from local authorities to fly drones?</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;""> Yes. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">Through our local partnerships, we have relationships with all of the appropriate government and provincial agencies in the areas where we fly and have procured all required approvals.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;""><br/></span></p>
<p align=""left""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">• Can these drones do anything other than chase poachers?</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;""> Yes. Depending on the camera suite on the aircraft, it can be used in many other significant ways: wildlife management, surveys, checking the integrity of fences, crop and water conditions, search and rescue.  They have many powerful uses that are beneficial to the parks we protect.</span></p>
<p align=""left""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;""><b>• Can poachers shoot down the drones?</b></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">  No. The aircraft have electric motors that allow them to be both silent and invisible – especially at night.  Even if a poacher did see a drone, it is far enough away and moving so fast that it is essentially impossible to hit with a rifle.</span><br/></p>
<p align=""left""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;"">• Do the drones have a deterrent effect?</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center;""> Absolutely. We make sure that local communities are aware that we are flying and what the drones can see and do.  This contributes to a significant deterrence effect.</span></p>
<p align=""left""><b>
</b></p>
<p align=""left""><b>• Can the drones be jammed or hacked?</b> All of the communications to and from the drones are encrypted, so it’s virtually impossible for poachers to take control of an aircraft or hack its video.  <br/>

Extraordinary Increase in Elephant and Rhino Poaching Deaths Threatens


 40,000
elephants and over 1,200 rhinos killed by poachers in a single year. At that rate both will be extinct within 10 years. In the last half-dozen years there has been an exponential increase in the killing of elephants and rhinos by poachers, Throughout Africa, over 100,000 elephants were killed between 2010 and the end of 2012 – 40,000 in 2013 alone.  




Illegal
poaching: $70 billion dollars a year and growing. Elephants
are slaughtered for their tusks, then their ivory is carved into trinkets. China
and the U.S. lead the countries that are driving the demand for ivory tusks. A
single tusk can be worth more than US$ 75,000.


Rhino
horns are worth over $65,000 per kilo on the black market. Criminal
gangs are involved as it’s worth more than gold. The skyrocketing values of
tusks (up to US$ 150,000) and horns (as much as US$ 500,000) generate
extraordinary profits.
Is
this worth the life of a majestic animal?



Rhino horn
powder.
It’s what the newly wealthy and fashionable in Vietnam use to spice up their
cocktail. It’s called “the drink of millionaires” and the “party drug of
choice.” Some boast that they can drink all night and not be hung over because
of rhino horn.

The problem is new, and accelerating rapidly 
 
Vietnam’s thirst for
powdered rhino horn is a new
phenomenon. It didn’t exist 10 years ago. This isn’t based on an age-old
tradition or eastern medicine. Opportunists making outrageous claims regarding
the power of rhino horn have created a booming market based on ignorance and
greed. The rapid increase in the Chinese middle class is fueling the huge
demand for carved ivory.
Rhinos used to roam in
the jungles of Vietnam. But not one
rhino is left. They have all been slaughtered for their horns, and the
Javan Rhino is now extinct.

Illegal wildlife
trade is one of the world's most lucrative criminal activities. Well-organized
syndicates operating as transnational criminal networks often participate in
other illegal activities, including trafficking in narcotics and weapons. Some
have links with terrorist networks.
The criminals are
ruthless with hundreds of park rangers killed in the line of duty.  This has left a great toll not only on
the animals but also on the lives of surrounding villagers who are corrupted by the
lure of big money.


A
perfect pair: Drones that See at Night & Powerful ComputersPoachers operate under the cover of night, and until now, rangers have not had an effective way to find them before they kill.  We fly drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that have infrared cameras and GPS on them and can send back thermal images of animals . . . and poachers.  They’re electric, silent and invisible but provide the information operators use to rapidly vector rangers to the location of the poacher before he kills.It works. Flying in one area where as many as 19 rhinos were killed each month, there have been no deaths – for six months.  None at all.             Others have tried and not succeeded, but our Air Shepherd approach is the only intervention that has been shown to literally stop
poaching.  We have demonstrable proof that our drone program works. Quietly developed and tested in southern Africa for over two years with
US$ 2 million in investment and over 1000 hours of flying time, we can now say
one thing with confidence: where we fly, the poaching stops. Completely.
Carefully tested drone operations provides us with a huge advantage over any other approach to stopping poaching in Africa.

A Systems Approach
That Eliminates Options

Right now, rangers
own the day: But at night, the situation changes. Almost all poaching of big
animals happens between 6:30 PM and 8:30 PM. Poachers gather intelligence about
where the animals are located during the day and then, under the cover of dark,
they quickly kill, cut off horns and tusks and rapidly leave the area.But now, we can change that. 

They’ll produce flight
plans for our drones, to tell them where to go and then ship them by email
or satellite straight to the field. 





  
The  mobile ground control center is driven as close to the threat area as possible from where we can launch and control the drones. 




 

Drones are launched and flown constantly during the threat window, with batteries rapidly swapped out and aircraft relaunched to assure solid coverage.
Autopilots allow the drones to patrol a preplanned track, diverting only when anomalies are identified. Everything seen with their infrared cameras will be transmitted back to the ground control system that keeps in touch with the aircraft. A complete record of everything collected by the drone is stored for future analysis.





 
When a potential
poacher is spotted, drone operators
radio the location to nearby rangers who intercept and capture the poachers.  






 
After the mission is complete, data including animal
sightings, weather conditions, poacher engagements, etc. are sent back to the
analytical team to be integrated into the main database for the area.







Drone Aircraft
Air Shepherd  is drone agnostic - we want the best aircraft
that we can find for the job at hand. Drone design is advancing very quickly so
we are constantly evaluating different platforms and we have designed our
approach to be adaptable to the most capable emerging technology. Currently,
based on testing in various environments, our partners in South Africa fly custom
designed UAV’s that include  fixed wing
and multi-rotor airframes of varying capability. 


 
Airborne SensorsOur airplanes carry powerful control systems and sensors that give them extraordinary capabilities that are ideal for the anti-poaching mission.  



Every drone has a solid-state inertial system that maintains its flying attitude, regardless of winds, etc.  Each has an internal GPS receiver that tells the aircraft where it is (and where the cameras are looking) at all times. At least two zooming camera systems are carried on gyro-stabilized gimbals, which keep the cameras pointing at the same location, regardless of bumpy air or heading changes.  One camera is designed for visible light and is operated during the daytime; the other is an infrared sensing device that provides thermal imaging during hours of darkness. 
On-board datalink communications keep the aircraft in touch with the Ground Control System, sending navigation, piloting and camera operation instructions up to the aircraft and downlinking positional and live video streams from the camera systems. The communications links are encrypted for security.  

Aerial Command Center


Only technologically sophisticated capabilities
can provide the mobility and discrimination to effectively determine
what is really going on in the African bush at night. The mobile command
center is a support vehicle which includes:

Remote controlled aircraft and avionics
A variety of mounted cameras to accommodate day
and night (infrared) surveillance
Accessories such as antennae, batteries and
trackers
Radio and communication systems
Support services such as Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) mapping, database capacity and recording software
Monitoring equipment and software
Spare parts and maintenance tools

Support services for the crew such as tents,
beds, rations, etc.


Predictive Analysis 


The task integrates several factors including: the poachers’ known
past behaviors, terrain information (elevation data, trafficability data), and
the movement patterns of the animals. The platform develops a coordinated
theory that has been successful in all tests and live applications.

Highly Trained Operators

 

The field crew includes at least a pilot and a systems operator, both of whom are highly trained in these specialized operations. The pilot is responsible for all of the physical aspects of the drone – launching, recovering, navigation, maintenance, etc.  The systems operator monitors the streaming video, analyzing what is happening in the area where the aircraft is flying, communicating with rangers, recording data feeds, etc.  
Operating these aircraft effectively requires four months of training before individual crew members can be sent into the field on their own.  









Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife





The Province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa is home to multiple rhino reserves, under the management of Ezemvelo KwaZulu-Natal Wildlife (Ezemvelo). Combined, these reserves are the custodians of  approximately 2,500 rhinos. The region possesses the rhino population with the farthest reaching genetic pool. In order to ensure the viability of future populations, the protection of rhino from this region is of critical importance and will impact on all future population growth efforts. which are extremely vulnerable to poaching syndicates.
From an operational perspective, Ezemvelo is the ideal environment in which to utilize new technologies such as UAVs to enhance anti-poaching efforts, as rhino and other wildlife populations are contained within multiple small and manageable conservation areas.
Ezemvelo, in association with Peace Parks Foundation, has for the past couple of years deployed drones on a trial basis to test the capability of an assortment of UAV technologies as instruments to support anti-poaching operations in varying environmental and operational conditions. So far the project has had positive impact, and the presence of UAVs in the reserves has been instrumental in disrupting illegal activities in general.


Air Shepherd has committed to join Ezemvelo and Peace Parks Foundation and combine years of experience and skills in a collaborative effort to maximize the use of drone technology at the frontlines of the poaching war.




A History of UAVs in
EKZNW

In 2012, with the onset of the rapid
increase in wildlife crime and specifically rhino poaching, EKZNW entered into
an agreement with a service provider to undertake a pilot rhino security aerial
surveillance and monitoring project using UAVs. The main objective was to
reduce rhino poaching attempts and provide effective protection of the
Hluhluwe, iMfolozi Park (HiP) rhino population.
This project continued for a period of two years, and the mortality statistics from start to termination of the project clearly showed a significant decrease in poaching mortalities: a 65% reduction in rhino poaching compared to the previous year. Since that time UAV tactics have been upgraded resulting in no poaching 
deaths in any area where drones were flying in the last six months.


The decrease in poaching is greatly attributed to the presence of drones in the park, combined with other strategic law enforcement and monitoring projects and operations.  Many countries are calling for help 
The poaching problem is widespread, and the word is getting out about
our success. Already seven countries across Africa have approached our team
asking for help to develop anti-poaching programs. 

 
Most countries need multiple Air Shepherd teams to
fully cover all of the opportunities that are being presented to us. As a result, we will
require 45-50 teams, which is our mid-range goal: to rapidly proliferate our
capability across Africa and dramatically reduce big-time poaching. 









The Charles A. and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Foundation
Air Shepherd is a project of The Lindbergh Foundation which was founded in 1977 by friends of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh (including Neil Armstrong, Gen. Jimmy Doolittle, Sir Edmund Hillary and others), to continue the Lindberghs’ legacy of supporting efforts that balance the use of technology with the interests of our environment. The foundation is a 501(c)(3), tax exempt nonprofit organization (not a family foundation) that has supported innovative research for over 35 years and now focuses its resources on aviation-related initiatives that benefit the natural world.









Peace Parks Foundation 
Peace Parks Foundation (PPF) was founded by Nelson Mandela, Dr Anton Rupert and Prince Bernard of the Netherlands in 1997 to facilitate the establishment of transfrontier conservation areas (TFCAs) in southern Africa. Today, the overall objective of PPF is to facilitate and co-ordinate the establishment and development of TFCAs that have the potential of safe-guarding the integrity of biological diversity, whilst at the same time contributing to the development of shared economic benefits and poverty alleviation.
The Foundation has a number of focus areas, including the development of the region’s TFCAs, community development projects in and around those areas, training wildlife managers at the Southern African Wildlife College, training in hospitality and in tracking skills at the SA College for Tourism, facilitating research and experimental work on animal diseases at the Hans Hoheisen Wildlife Research Station, and combatting wildlife crime. Given the trans-national nature of wildlife crime, the region’s peace parks are playing a crucial role in combatting it as countries jointly counter the onslaught across national borders and work towards harmonizing policies and legislation.

Timeline







We’ve developed a proven way to stop poaching. In one location in Southern Africa where up to 19 rhinos were being killed a month, none died during the six months that we flew there. The poaching stopped.At the present rate of killing, all elephants and rhinos will be dead within ten years, but you can help us assure that that doesn’t happen. You can literally help save these magnificent animals from extinction.  Someday you will be able to tell your grandchildren, “Elephants and rhinos are still here because I helped to fund the program that saved their lives.”We have the technology, we have the people, we have the experience, we know it works.  Now, we just need your support. 
You can help us two ways:

Frequently Asked Questions


• Is anyone else successfully flying drones in anti-poaching missions?  No.  We are the only organization on the continent that we are aware of that has a significant, sustained, successful drone-based anti-poaching program.  We have been quietly operating and evaluating with over 600 missions, so know this works. Other groups have tested drones in short trials, but have not been successful.• Do your drones have guns or missiles on them? No. These are small drones with sophisticated cameras. They are designed for surveillance and protection, not destruction.  
• How big are your drones? They are fixed-wing aircraft that look like large airplanes, but have wingspans of approximately 2 meters or 6 feet.
• Who supplies your drones?Currently, a South African based UAV company,  has custom designed and manufactured the UAV’s used in pilot programs for the last two years. But we are testing many different types of drones to determine which ones will work best in the different situations and terrain where we will fly in the future.
• Is this stuff complicated?  Yes.  It takes four months to properly train crew members who are deploy in the field.  Significant time and dedication is required to learn to operate and maintain the aircraft, interpret what is being sent back from the aircraft, and master the mission requirements.
• Where do your people come from?  We are committed to hiring and training local people.
• How long do the drones fly? The aircraft average about two hours per battery. When the battery is low, they are brought back, a new battery is plugged in, and they are re-launched.  The batteries are recharged in the mobile control vehicle.
• How long will it take to put a new team in the field once the funding is available?  It takes approximately two months to hire crew, acquire aircraft and vehicles, and begin the training process. 
• Do you need permission from local authorities to fly drones? Yes. Through our local partnerships, we have relationships with all of the appropriate government and provincial agencies in the areas where we fly and have procured all required approvals.
• Can these drones do anything other than chase poachers? Yes. Depending on the camera suite on the aircraft, it can be used in many other significant ways: wildlife management, surveys, checking the integrity of fences, crop and water conditions, search and rescue.  They have many powerful uses that are beneficial to the parks we protect.
• Can poachers shoot down the drones?  No. The aircraft have electric motors that allow them to be both silent and invisible – especially at night.  Even if a poacher did see a drone, it is far enough away and moving so fast that it is essentially impossible to hit with a rifle.
• Do the drones have a deterrent effect? Absolutely. We make sure that local communities are aware that we are flying and what the drones can see and do.  This contributes to a significant deterrence effect.


• Can the drones be jammed or hacked? All of the communications to and from the drones are encrypted, so it’s virtually impossible for poachers to take control of an aircraft or hack its video.

At the Royal Horticultural Society of Ireland we have the very exciting task of restoring the 18th Century walled garden at Russborough House in Co. Wicklow, Ireland. It is an enormous undertaking but we are very privileged to have been entrusted with such an important cultural and horticultural project. This is a real garden for real people. You the stakeholders can help pass this garden onto future generations. Your contribution is literally putting another brick in the wall of the foundations of Irish gardening. Be inspired!



What you receive?
Crowdfunding is a new way of fundraising whereby a community can come together as individual sponsors and fund a project. In return you receive a perk, for example if you sponsor a rose bush, you will get a certificate and your name will be on the label for that rose. The certificate can contain a message and the rose can be planted for yourself or someone else. For every brick, rose, tree  planted or gardener sponsored you will receive this beautiful certificate. What a wonderful gift for someone that loves Ireland!
Help us fill this garden with life once again
 To restore the garden we need to replace, replant or grow everything from the bricks in the wall to our magnificent fountain in the centre. For the wildlife garden we need titbits to entice our friends the insects and frogs to step back into their old haunt.
You will be able to see the garden laid out in different styles & actively participate in running the garden. It will encourage you to educate yourself and others to learn about all aspects of gardening.
Where else can you buy a piece of Ireland that will be forever yours? Every penny will go into restoring the garden.

<h3>A Landmark Model to Fight Climate Change</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span></span></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p>We
have a rare opportunity to create a turning point for the climate movement, and
we need your help to overpower the one thing that stands in our way. Boulder is
on the verge of taking the biggest step it can to combat climate change--but
the coal industry is prepared to spend whatever it takes to stop us, and to
keep other communities from getting ideas and getting organized. Defeating the
coal industry is as much about our community as it is about yours--which is why
we need your help, and fast.</p>
<p>Boulder
wants to break away from our current, coal-dominated utility--Xcel Energy--to
create a local electric utility based on renewable energy. Feasibility studies
have shown we could reduce our carbon emissions by over 50% immediately by
shifting to cleaner energy. And we wouldn’t have to pay more than we do now,
because we could afford a lot more renewable energy if we’re not paying for
Xcel’s enormous profit margins. This is an incredible opportunity to create a
landmark model for how communities all over the country can take control of
their energy future.</p>
<p>Only
one thing stands in our way: to stop us, Xcel Energy has helped place a misleading
measure on our fall ballot that would kill our local electric utility process
dead in its tracks-- and they're probably prepared to spend a lot to win. They
know our victory would inspire communities across the country to follow suit
and create their own cleaner, cheaper utilities based on renewable energy. They
don’t want other communities wondering what they could afford if they stop
paying millions in profits to the utility industry.</p>
<p>To
win, we have to out-organize Xcel--which we did in 2011, when our city decided
to go down this path. But Xcel didn’t see us coming that time, which is why we
need a bigger campaign this year to reach more voters. Boulder voters already
said they wanted to create a local utility--this year, it's a matter of making
sure we turn them all out to the polls.</p>
<p>That’s
why we need help from beyond Boulder. This needs to be the moment when we
overpower the coal industry and make Boulder a real model for communities to
credibly address the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Contribute

The whole story
</h3>
<p>
Back in 2011, our community did something no other community had ever done before: we voted to explore taking control of our power supply for the sole purpose of lowering our impact on the planet. Xcel Energy spent nearly $1 million dollars on that election, but lost--because a committed group of community advocates and a small nonprofit that engages young people in politics won the day. Outspent 10-to-1, the grassroots coalition registered voters, knocked on doors, and made thousands of phone calls. 
</p>
<p>
With voter approval, the city launched an extensive analysis and found that it could get cleaner, cheaper power that was just as reliable all on its own. 
</p>
<p>
But now, Xcel is back, with a misleading initiative they’ve helped place on Boulder’s fall ballot that would stop the city’s formation of a local electric utility dead in its tracks. Their ballot measure is masquerading as a way to reduce government debt, but it’s really just a dirty trick--the measure includes impossible, even illegal, requirements that would stall out the very process voters already approved. 
</p>
<p>
They’re back to undermine our local process, because the city’s findings made it clear that they stand to lose more than the $35 million dollars in profits they make annually from Boulder. They know that Boulder is on the verge of setting a precedent of national significance that would threaten not just Xcel, but the very core of the coal energy’s business model--not to mention that industry’s billions of dollars in profits. 
</p>
<p>
We out-organized them in 2011, and we know we can again in 2013 if we have the resources to achieve the reach we need. Boulder has already voted to move forward--this fight is about keeping the coal industry from holding us back.</p>
<h3>
Our campaign
</h3>
This grassroots campaign is going to need a lot more resources than the goal we’ve set for this Indiegogo. But our goal is what we need to get our efforts off the ground in a strong way to make sure our movement lays the groundwork it needs to win in November.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">FAQs</span><br/></p>
<h4><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;""></span></h4>
<h4>What is “Municipalization”?</h4>
<p>Municipalization is when a community owns the electrical
utility.  The utility would hire an experienced company to operate it, at
least initially. But the city would have the local decision-making power to
choose what kind of energy it purchases on the open market.</p>
<h4>Are there other municipal utilities?</h4>
<p>Twenty-nine Colorado communities, including Longmont, Fort
Collins, and Colorado Springs, have successfully run municipal electric systems
for decades. There are thousands of municipal utilities across the country, but
none of them municipalized for the purposes of lowering their greenhouse gas
emissions and investing in more renewable energy.</p>
<h4>Who would the City have run Boulder’s municipal electric system?</h4>
<p>The City would most likely
contract with a company that is experienced with setting up and running an
electric distribution system day-to-day. The City utility would purchase power
from one or more independent power producers. It can use the competitive free
market to get the best price on power from sources that minimize their
environmental impact. The City would select a Utility Board with citizens,
customers and business representatives plus a director, experienced with
electric utilities, to oversee the contractor(s).

</p>
<h4><span>What would happen to electricity rates?</span></h4>
<p>The city's charter language states that the city is not allowed
to move forward with municipalizing unless if it can do so while keeping rates
the same or better than Xcel Energy. This means customers will be provided with
cleaner, renewable energy and not have to pay more for it. </p>
<p>The best calculations
currently available, from the phase-1 (and soon to be released phase-2)
modeling by the City experts, based on a range of assumptions and more likely
scenarios, and with over 50% CO2 reduction from Xcel’s current emissions and
50% to 60% renewables (vs. Xcel’s 24% renewables, currently, and its 38% coal,
in  2030, as shown  in Xcel’s 2011 electric resource plan).
 These show that there are city options that not only are very likely to
beat Xcel’s rates on day one of the City utility, but also beat them on average
over 20 years.  Whether or not this will be the result of the final
analysis does require a certain range of the most likely startup costs, but
that is exactly why the process should continue.  We cannot know if a City
utility is financially acceptable unless we know the startup costs and we can
only know these if we complete the exploration so we can make a decision.
 The bottom line is that your bill will be basically the same or better.

</p>
<h4><span>What about renewables? How much could we get?</span></h4>
<p>The City’s Phase-1 modeling suggests that we could get 58%
renewables and 54% CO2 reduction almost immediately while remaining cost
competitive if we have reasonable startup costs or this might be delayed a bit
while we transition out of the Xcel system. The generation mix would
include backup electricity from natural gas as well as growing amounts of wind
and solar, increasing the proportion of renewables as they make economic sense.
 (We can use gas as a backup fuel and could find the cleanest source of
gas energy or work to replace it with more renewable sources like gas from
bio-char or bio-mass.)  </p>
<p>Electricity from natural gas produces less CO2 per kilowatt-hour
than electricity from coal, assuming there is little or no leakage in
production of the gas and the gas is burned completely.  So, our carbon
footprint can be reduced as soon as we switch from Xcel’s generation mix, if we
require our gas suppliers to certify their leakage rates are very low and ethically
produced.  As it becomes economic, we can then transfer to renewable
alternatives to replace natural gas as fast as possible, using bio-gas or some
other sustainable fuel source, and use of gas will drop even faster.
 While the City utility’s use of natural gas decreases over time in its
plans, Xcel’s 2011 electric resource plan (ERP) shows an increasing reliance on
natural-gas-generated energy that climbs to 52% natural gas by 2037 and because
lowest price is the what the PUC (Public Utility Commission) prioritizes, it is
unlikely that the leakage or ethics of the production of natural gas will be
considered in contracts.</p>
<p>With a backup of natural
gas, renewables could be added fairly easily to our generation mix as they
become increasingly economical and available. </p>

<p></p>
<h4><span>How much could we cut our CO2 emissions?</span></h4>Phase-1 modeling by City experts suggests that a municipal utility could achieve 54% CO2 reduction and 58% renewables initially while not exceeding Xcel Energy’s current cost for its mix of only 23.1% renewables in 2017 and 24.4% in 2037, according to Xcel’s 2011 plan</span><p><br/></p>

Thank you so much for your overwhelming support. We can't express how appreciative we are for your financial support and motivating words.Boulder voted 2-to-1 to defeat Xcel's deceptive ballot measure. It was an amazing victory mandating to protect Boulder's clean energy future. 

But our work isn't finished.
Despite their defeat, Xcel is refusing to cooperate with Boulder. They're suing the city and organizing some sketchy opposition--the latest in their efforts to keep Boulder from creating our own city-owned utility.
New Era is working to call out Xcel on their foul play. We can't let them undermine our progress. 
Click here to support New Era's critical work for local power.
Click here to take action and tell Xcel to leave Boulder alone. 
We couldn't do all this without you. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you. 



UPDATE 9/18:

With less than 15 hours left of our Indiegogo campaign, we want to offer one last deal:
Not only has a generous donor offered to match--dollar for dollar-- everything we raise between 9/11 and the end of the Indiegogo, 
BUT
anyone who donates $50 or more before 1 pm MST will receive our Pick a Side T-shirt,
Last call!
UPDATE 9/11: 
A generous donor has offered to match--dollar for dollar--everything we raise between 9/11 and the end of the Indiegogo!


Friends -

With your support, we hit our original goal!!! We can’t thank you enough. It’s incredible.
But, we have to be honest with you: really, we need to blow past our goal.
 We need the resources to register voters, train volunteer organizers, and to get our message on the airwaves far and wide. Xcel Energy is likely going to outspend us by a lot of money--but their dirty money doesn’t matter if we can out-organize them. We beat them in 2011, but they'll fight harder this time around. That’s why we need organizers, to recruit more volunteers, to reach more voters face-to-face. Please build this campaign to defeat the Xcel-connected disingenuous ballot measure once and for all, by giving what you can and sharing this campaign. After all, this fight is about not just our community, but yours too.
And hey, you can also give your time. Click here to volunteer to organize the Boulder community.
If you'd like to give, but are having problems with the credit card processing, drop us a line.
A Landmark Model to Fight Climate Change


We
have a rare opportunity to create a turning point for the climate movement, and
we need your help to overpower the one thing that stands in our way. Boulder is
on the verge of taking the biggest step it can to combat climate change--but
the coal industry is prepared to spend whatever it takes to stop us, and to
keep other communities from getting ideas and getting organized. Defeating the
coal industry is as much about our community as it is about yours--which is why
we need your help, and fast.
Boulder
wants to break away from our current, coal-dominated utility--Xcel Energy--to
create a local electric utility based on renewable energy. Feasibility studies
have shown we could reduce our carbon emissions by over 50% immediately by
shifting to cleaner energy. And we wouldn’t have to pay more than we do now,
because we could afford a lot more renewable energy if we’re not paying for
Xcel’s enormous profit margins. This is an incredible opportunity to create a
landmark model for how communities all over the country can take control of
their energy future.
Only
one thing stands in our way: to stop us, Xcel Energy has helped place a misleading
measure on our fall ballot that would kill our local electric utility process
dead in its tracks-- and they're probably prepared to spend a lot to win. They
know our victory would inspire communities across the country to follow suit
and create their own cleaner, cheaper utilities based on renewable energy. They
don’t want other communities wondering what they could afford if they stop
paying millions in profits to the utility industry.
To
win, we have to out-organize Xcel--which we did in 2011, when our city decided
to go down this path. But Xcel didn’t see us coming that time, which is why we
need a bigger campaign this year to reach more voters. Boulder voters already
said they wanted to create a local utility--this year, it's a matter of making
sure we turn them all out to the polls.
That’s
why we need help from beyond Boulder. This needs to be the moment when we
overpower the coal industry and make Boulder a real model for communities to
credibly address the climate crisis.
Contribute
to our issue committee to move us--all of us--forward, to create the turning point. Help us keep our
democracy and our planet out of the hands of the highest bidder.

bio-char or bio-mass.)  
Electricity from natural gas produces less CO2 per kilowatt-hour
than electricity from coal, assuming there is little or no leakage in
production of the gas and the gas is burned completely.  So, our carbon
footprint can be reduced as soon as we switch from Xcel’s generation mix, if we
require our gas suppliers to certify their leakage rates are very low and ethically
produced.  As it becomes economic, we can then transfer to renewable
alternatives to replace natural gas as fast as possible, using bio-gas or some
other sustainable fuel source, and use of gas will drop even faster.
 While the City utility’s use of natural gas decreases over time in its
plans, Xcel’s 2011 electric resource plan (ERP) shows an increasing reliance on
natural-gas-generated energy that climbs to 52% natural gas by 2037 and because
lowest price is the what the PUC (Public Utility Commission) prioritizes, it is
unlikely that the leakage or ethics of the production of natural gas will be
considered in contracts.
With a backup of natural
gas, renewables could be added fairly easily to our generation mix as they
become increasingly economical and available. 






How much could we cut our CO2 emissions?Phase-1 modeling by City experts suggests that a municipal utility could achieve 54% CO2 reduction and 58% renewables initially while not exceeding Xcel Energy’s current cost for its mix of only 23.1% renewables in 2017 and 24.4% in 2037, according to Xcel’s 2011 plan

A note on tax-deductible donations: If you plan on claiming the tax-deduction AND receive a perk, you can only claim the amount of the donation minus the value of the perk. For instance, if the perk you receive is ""worth"" $20, then you should subtract $20 from your overall donation to know how much you can claim for a deduction.

At the time of this blockade, his brothers and sisters were not defined by race or color. Where, in this moment of time, the only line drawn was the hand reaching out in friendship. The Island united, as one society, standing up for what they believed in. There is no greater power than being selfless! Linnaea Farm School and its parents made a conscious choice to close school and stand united as a community. There was no school, no chopping wood, no business -- only the idea that it was the right thing to do! He remembers that time. Everything stopped, his Cortesian society stood as one people, one voice, and one idea. At that moment, the community held the balance of nature in its hands, and it felt empowering.</p>
<p>The boy was a proud person that day, yes, demonstrating social democracy at its core-self. On that day, the community relationships with each other stopped the clear cutting of the forest. That boy is now a man, and hopes that the community will stand again and safe guard the forest where he grew up.</p>
<p>I will come home to continue what I started as a young boy. It is time to stand again as a community. That will not be a great day -- it will be an amazing day.</p>

<h1>Dear Donors,</h1>
<p>I am Kiyoshi Kosky and I grew up on Cortes Island. As a child, I was part of a blockade. We successfully stopped McMillan Bloedel from industrial clear cut logging our island and if we have to, we will do it again. Our island is threatened once again, as they are coming for our most precious resource, the old growth trees, and will be liquidating our mature second growth forest also.</p>
<p>This time, the beast is Brookfield Asset Management Corporation, based in Toronto. The company is an off-shore conglomerate avoiding Canadian taxes. It does not care for the well-being of our community and the ecology on the island. Brookfield Asset Management Corporation’s logging company, Island Timberlands, has stated that it will use herbicides to suppress foliage during the replanting process. They promise buffers to protect wetlands and waterways, but those are small compared to what many call for, and may poison our wetlands, shallow aquifers, and waterways if these toxic chemicals are used.</p>
<p>The old growth on Cortes is the heart and life force of the island. The old growth is what keeps our Island’s quality of health well. These old growth forests are the anchors of our shallow aquifers. Every person on the island relies on aquifers and Island Timberlands chemicals will not help those water supplies. Salt Spring Island fought hard to make sure it didn’t have to ship water onto the island when a logging company came knocking at their door looking to clear cut huge regions and we will do the same.</p>
<p>My parent’s former property on Cortes Island had a shallow well dug. When I was a kid, the well was dry two months of the year. Today, that well is dry six to eight months of the year. We cannot afford to sacrifice our island’s water supply for a corporation that will take our precious old growth and leave nothing for our community but dry wells.</p>
<p>We are not against forestry, we are against industrial clear cut logging that will leave little benefit to the community and threaten our water supplies. On Cortes Island, we practice Sustainable Forestry which creates local jobs while leaving the forest canopy in place. Cortes Island is a model of how to slow down climate change.</p>
<p>We have built a Forest Camp to defend our community and land. We need your donations to help fund our Forest Camp and help with the impending possibility of blockading against Island Timberlands. The money will be used to buy food and supplies for the camp. If for some reason, the money is not used to fight against this intrusion, then we will put the donated funds towards the purchase of Island Timberlands lands on the island.</p>
<p>With your financial help, we will overcome and be successful in our journey to protect our land and do the right thing for future generations. Thank you for your time and understanding about this special place in British Columbia, Canada.</p>

IT does own the land, and as a corporation, they manage it to maximize economic profit.

<p>What a gift I’ve been given, to be raised by a village. Here, on and around Cortes, human and non human community has given me priceless gifts, that only now, having lived elsewhere, in metropolis and clearcuts alike, I have come to more fully appreciate.</p>
<p>As a teenager I couldn't wait to get out of here, but now returning after 17 years, i've witnessed the devastation of industrialization on the biosphere and it's components, whether it’s in the stony straight lines of concrete and the grey frowning faces of the commuters in the cities,or miles of massive stumps in clearcuts, I realize how precious the remaining wilderness and in particular biodiverse old growth forest stands are to the retention of life on land and in the sea.</p>
<p>Thank you to my parents, who chose to raise me like they did, in a complex ecosystem where we could catch grow and collect our food, socialize and interact with people of all ages and spend our time in the natural world. Living in the Gorge Harbour on a float house at age six was the pinnacle of my idyllic childhood memories.</p>
<p>There was always a sorrow when my dad killed the fish, but he taught me to thank the fish for giving its life to sustain our own. Our thanks was to take only what we needed and never to waste. To protect it from our personal human potential to damage it and pollute it, and from other larger forces of industry that seek to profit without giving back.</p>
<p>I have spent ten years in clearcuts and know well the results of industrial logging practices.

I will sing with my sister Amy and my dear friend Marguerite on Friday the 24th at 7:30pm, and although I’m not particularly keen on public performance, I feel it is my responsibility to give my gifts back. I will be singing for the forest, forgetting my shyness, and adding my voice to the song.</p>
<p>I invite you all, my dear community, to bring your gifts, your talents, your strengths, your song to protect the community of plants &amp; animals who give us these gifts in the first place, to come and add your voice. I implore you to see the sadness of IT's plans as a call to action, and not to give up.</p>

</div></div>","One Island, One community, Caretakers of the Trees
I want to tell you a story about a young boy who stood in a blockade against the forestry company, Macmillan Blodel, in Squirrel Cove, many years ago. At the time of this blockade, his brothers and sisters were not defined by race or color. Where, in this moment of time, the only line drawn was the hand reaching out in friendship. The Island united, as one society, standing up for what they believed in. There is no greater power than being selfless! Linnaea Farm School and its parents made a conscious choice to close school and stand united as a community. There was no school, no chopping wood, no business -- only the idea that it was the right thing to do! He remembers that time. Everything stopped, his Cortesian society stood as one people, one voice, and one idea. At that moment, the community held the balance of nature in its hands, and it felt empowering.
The boy was a proud person that day, yes, demonstrating social democracy at its core-self. On that day, the community relationships with each other stopped the clear cutting of the forest. That boy is now a man, and hopes that the community will stand again and safe guard the forest where he grew up.
I will come home to continue what I started as a young boy. It is time to stand again as a community. That will not be a great day -- it will be an amazing day.
Kiyoshi Kosky

Dear Donors,
I am Kiyoshi Kosky and I grew up on Cortes Island. As a child, I was part of a blockade. We successfully stopped McMillan Bloedel from industrial clear cut logging our island and if we have to, we will do it again. Our island is threatened once again, as they are coming for our most precious resource, the old growth trees, and will be liquidating our mature second growth forest also.
This time, the beast is Brookfield Asset Management Corporation, based in Toronto. The company is an off-shore conglomerate avoiding Canadian taxes. It does not care for the well-being of our community and the ecology on the island. Brookfield Asset Management Corporation’s logging company, Island Timberlands, has stated that it will use herbicides to suppress foliage during the replanting process. They promise buffers to protect wetlands and waterways, but those are small compared to what many call for, and may poison our wetlands, shallow aquifers, and waterways if these toxic chemicals are used.
The old growth on Cortes is the heart and life force of the island. The old growth is what keeps our Island’s quality of health well. These old growth forests are the anchors of our shallow aquifers. Every person on the island relies on aquifers and Island Timberlands chemicals will not help those water supplies. Salt Spring Island fought hard to make sure it didn’t have to ship water onto the island when a logging company came knocking at their door looking to clear cut huge regions and we will do the same.
My parent’s former property on Cortes Island had a shallow well dug. When I was a kid, the well was dry two months of the year. Today, that well is dry six to eight months of the year. We cannot afford to sacrifice our island’s water supply for a corporation that will take our precious old growth and leave nothing for our community but dry wells.
We are not against forestry, we are against industrial clear cut logging that will leave little benefit to the community and threaten our water supplies. On Cortes Island, we practice Sustainable Forestry which creates local jobs while leaving the forest canopy in place. Cortes Island is a model of how to slow down climate change.
We have built a Forest Camp to defend our community and land. We need your donations to help fund our Forest Camp and help with the impending possibility of blockading against Island Timberlands. The money will be used to buy food and supplies for the camp. If for some reason, the money is not used to fight against this intrusion, then we will put the donated funds towards the purchase of Island Timberlands lands on the island.
With your financial help, we will overcome and be successful in our journey to protect our land and do the right thing for future generations. Thank you for your time and understanding about this special place in British Columbia, Canada.

Looking Forward to ForestFest
Aug. 22, 2012, by Jill Milton and Barry Miles, Island Tides
With logging slated to begin this September, it’s time to think about the future of our forests. Starting with a few parcels of land this year, Island Timberlands plans to clear-cut all of their substantial holdings over the next years. IT does own the land, and as a corporation, they manage it to maximize economic profit. Taking timber out of the forest is not the problem; its the process of industrial logging that ignores any values but the bottom line... Continue reading.


Cortes Island ForestFest: Forest activism for all generations

As September draws near, Cortes Islanders and other opponents of industrial logging are gearing up to protect Cortes forests from Island Timberlands.This weekend, a multipurpose “ForestFest” brought blockaders and friends together for strategy and inspiration... Continue reading.


Celebration, Education and Inspiration at Forestfest
Sept. 1, 2012, by Alexis Stoymenoff, Island Tides
There’s a reason why outsiders who visit Cortes Island often find it a difficult place to leave. It’s not just the lush wooded landscapes, pristine coastlines, rare species and towering, ancient trees. Those things are a huge part of what makes Cortes so special... Continue reading.


A Letter of Gratitude to my Community
Aug. 21, 2012, by Rosemary Bockner, Island Tides
What a gift I’ve been given, to be raised by a village. Here, on and around Cortes, human and non human community has given me priceless gifts, that only now, having lived elsewhere, in metropolis and clearcuts alike, I have come to more fully appreciate.
As a teenager I couldn't wait to get out of here, but now returning after 17 years, i've witnessed the devastation of industrialization on the biosphere and it's components, whether it’s in the stony straight lines of concrete and the grey frowning faces of the commuters in the cities,or miles of massive stumps in clearcuts, I realize how precious the remaining wilderness and in particular biodiverse old growth forest stands are to the retention of life on land and in the sea.
Thank you to my parents, who chose to raise me like they did, in a complex ecosystem where we could catch grow and collect our food, socialize and interact with people of all ages and spend our time in the natural world. Living in the Gorge Harbour on a float house at age six was the pinnacle of my idyllic childhood memories.
There was always a sorrow when my dad killed the fish, but he taught me to thank the fish for giving its life to sustain our own. Our thanks was to take only what we needed and never to waste. To protect it from our personal human potential to damage it and pollute it, and from other larger forces of industry that seek to profit without giving back.
I have spent ten years in clearcuts and know well the results of industrial logging practices. I've planted harvest trees, which is really in essence the same as cutting them down, so I have worked in the forestry industry and love the way of life and the hard working people I've met, the loggers, contractors, treeplanters, brushers checkers, camp workers, and many others who have made their living in forestry, many for generations. We are all on the same side, treecutters, treehuggers and treeplanters alike stand to lose our way of life.
Life in metropolis, I've been there, I know what it is to have no community, to pass 1000 people on the street and never say hello. I know many people that think the supermarket is where food comes from and the tap is where water comes from, and everything you flush down the toilet or put on the curb on garbage day just disappears.
I remember the cornucopia of life in the early 80's. Seagulls that fascinated my child self by swallowing starfish whole. Oysters that dad would shuck on the beach and let me chew on the salty 'muscle' left on the shell. Moss and lichens that my mom taught me to identify. Catching red snappers and cod in the dingy for our dinner. Baby otters, minks, curious seals, enormous sunstars, luminous in the depth. Limpets and barnacles. Eagles and herons and loons. Thank you.
Thank you forests. Mushroom walks like easter egg hunts, meaty and satisfying in mashed potatoes and soups. Cool shady depths, mother trees that seem to absord voices. Fern kingdoms, black bogs and striking bright yellow skunk cabbages. Old falling down homesteads, swathed now in brambles, the homesteaders long gone and their remnants almost taken back into the earth by so many wet and windy winters. As time passes and more and more of what I knew is lost forever, I am grateful to have experienced it.
Thank you for teaching me that the ultimate gift is to return home, to return your gifts to your home.
I am involved in the organizing of Forestfest this year, in advance of IT's planned start date for the logging of their corporately owned lands,to bring the community together to share in one another's gifts, to prepare ourselves for whatever comes next, so that we can meet the threat of corporate greed with one voice, a united song.

<p><strong>There is a drastic need to decrease emissions and create green transportation networks in the U.S. and around the world so what remains of the environment can be preserved. We believe the Swiss Rail system is the model to follow if we are ever going to accomplish these goals. Help us to open eyes and change the American perception of trains and transportation as a whole before it is too late. The Swiss model provides the perfect remedy to $4 gas, waiting in rush hour and the choking fumes of smog. </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT?:</strong></p>
<p>Our documentary will focus on the Swiss rail network as the potential model that in addition to saving time, money and stress for the traveler saves precious natural resources and dramatically reduces pollution and its harmful effects on the global environment. Our findings will be used as a ""how-to"" guide for government agencies from the local to the federal level and private investors who wish to harness the potential windfall available to anyone who creates a transportation network based on the Swiss model. Our project is being undertaken with the blessing of the Swiss government and the open assistance of the Swiss Rail network who has graciously supplied our crew with all access permits to the rail system, stations, trains and employees of the railway, as well as unlimited passes to use any and all transportation within the network during filming.</p>
<p><strong>WHY SWITZERLAND?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s get technical for a minute…The Swiss rail system carries over 350 million passengers each year at an average rate of 17,750 km per person and 139,000 metric tons of total CO2 emissions. The average 6 cylinder gasoline engine car traveling the same distance emits about 4 metric tons of CO2. That means every 34,750 cars on the road traveling just under 11,000 miles per year emit as much Carbon as the entire Swiss Rail network. The U.S. alone has over 250 million registered vehicles. There are over 1 billion in the world.</p>
<p>Switzerland is one of the few places in the world with a nearly perfect rail travel efficiency record year after year, a rail system that is small enough to be manageable in standard length documentary and book form and a landscape and setting so beautiful that it alone is worthy of a feature film. Due to Switzerland’s rugged terrain the trains used are varied in gauge and style and have a classic look rarely found elsewhere. In all the country’s rail system is like a toy train set in large scale with incredibly photogenic properties. <strong>The best way to get a message across is to make it attractive so people seek it out and pay attention</strong>. Switzerland allows us to do that.</p>
<p>In addition to the green aspect of the rail system the documentary will feature the unique history, beauty, oddities and romance of the Swiss rail system. The project will involve trekking through the entire Swiss rail network, recording and photographing stations, trains, mountain passes, bridges, rail cars and the incredible vistas of the alpine region and Swiss lowlands in relation to the trains that serve them. We will highlight the most extreme sights including the highest rail link in the world the Top of Europe railway, the Glacier Express and the Bernina Express, both of which travel over mountains and into hidden valleys unreachable any other way. Special attention will be paid to the classic Swiss hamlets, historical structures and castles that dot the landscape atop the most impossible perches completely isolated from the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL RESEARCH:</strong></p>
<p>We have scheduled interviews with Swiss Rail executives to discuss how the railway attracts riders and gets its message out to the general public. We will focus on railway marketing, usage costs as compared to vehicle ownership and use and what the Swiss government is doing to make the train the way to go. We will compare these tactics with those in the U.S and around the world for effectiveness and approach. In the end the documentary should show the shortcomings of other rail systems versus the Swiss and how by adapting certain policies, marketing techniques and incentives, countries around the globe can make a significant dent in their vehicle exhaust emissions and the damage they are doing to the planet with each passing rush hour.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT TO EXPECT: </strong></p>
<p>Shooting and information gathering will take place over a one to two month long period starting in late Spring 2013. Documentary post production will be completed by Fall of 2013. A large scale photo-heavy book will be completed by the end of the year 2013 in time to accompany the documentary. The team is in discussions to arrange for presentations at public venues in major cities around the country as part of Earth Day 2014 and will be making appearances at high schools and universities to spread the message of green transportation.</p>
<p><strong>FUNDING NEEDS:</strong></p>
<p>The benefits provided by Swiss Rail and the Swiss government will help reduce the cost of the expedition by several thousand dollars but are not a total solution. On top of the tremendous benefits being provided by Swiss Rail, we are in need of funding for basic accommodations during the two month trek, some specialized equipment in addition to that we already possess, post production expenses and supplies.</p>
<p><strong>THE TEAM:</strong></p>
<p>Our NYC based team members possess unique skills each with a key role in the project. Our team consists of a professional writer, TV and film editor, PR and marketing specialist and destination expert who together make up an A-Team strike force of project completion.</p></div>","This is a non-profit project concerned only with getting out the message, changing minds and saving the environment.

<h3>Some history...</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Z-kollektivet is located in Höör, Skåne, in the south of Sweden and is an <b>eco-friendly group of people who are creating an example of how people can live differently in a new healthy, loving, and sustainable way by sharing our life in as many ways as possible and being an example for the rest of the world. </b>We started this project in 2010, a family of 5 persons who since then have tried to find a group of people who want to team up with us. Some years later we have now formed a core group and are ready to show the world what we are made of! Our common religion is, honesty, openness, respect, caring and sharing, and, doing as little harm as possible to people, plants and animals. </p>
<p>The whole project will be open source model so anyone can follow us and take notes, learn and maybe do something similar themselves. And we will gladly support such actions! We decided to face the challenge of building a home for us all, with as little money as possible, while at the same time as much self sustainable as possible. It will be a house, a project, a place where people can come and visit, learn and be inspired.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>In this first round of funding, we need <b>$ 9000</b>. This money will help us <b>with the down payment to the land and pre approval building permission</b> so we can buy the land and start collecting all material needed for the house and green house (biodome). </p>

<p>(This is our friends straw bale house in Argentina) </p>
<p>Once the down payment is done, we will continue to pay the on going loan until fully paid. If we should make it to this first goal and there should be any excess money, this will only go to material for the house and nothing else. In case we don't reach our goal, we will just continue a bit more until we reach it because we know this WILL happen! We are finding more and more people who want to help for free with building, tools, skills, material, etc… all to make this as cheap as possible and better than what you can buy! We have worked very hard for this and we plan not to stop until it's done! So help us out. ok!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Fundamental to Z-kollektivet are a few principal factors: <b>sustainability, recycled material, natural materials, local material, simpleness</b> and a <b>simple lifestyle in harmony with our surroundings. The goal is a zero energy sustainable straw bale community house. (about 4000 sqf = 375 kvm) One o four goals are to get as much material and help we can for free since we know there is an abundance of resources in the world, both material as well as people and skills.</b></p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you will help us create a <b>unique idea and powerful message leading the way for the changes we need to make, to transition away from money, competition, separation and waste, to a world where we care and share our life with cooperation as our leading star</b>. This funding will allow us to buy the land we have found (a wonderful piece of land) so we can raise awareness about the global madness we see today of wasting resources and a never ending consumption and ruining our planet. We love to see and live the change, specially for the children of our future!</p>

We, like many of you, have fond memories of going to these lakes and other natural waterways with family and friends. These memories that we all have of these pristine waterways are a gift that should be treasured, but when we saw that future generations may be limited in their abilities to enjoy these natural habitats due to the effects on local wildlife caused by runoff and contamination, we realized that we can no longer wait for governments to do this - it would be up to us and you to stop this.</p><h3>THE PROBLEM:</h3><p>The chief cause of algae blooms are cyanobacteria. Although they are naturally present in all bodies of water, certain industrial and recreational activities can often lead to them rapidly multiplying out of control. In addition to direct human factors, the addition of invasive species such as the zebra mussel has caused further loss of biodiversity (“Zebra Mussel Fact Sheet”) through predation of zooplankton, native phytoplankton, and other small organisms, all of which are necessary competitors and predators to the algae. The most obvious effect of this can be seen in the appearance of the infested body: massive tangled mats of algae will blanket the surface of a eutrophied lake with thick bluish-green slime, obscuring any natural beauty that might have been present – and also choking out anything that relies on sunlight filtering through the water.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560493317/hkkwqb7bm6qyi0qsmagc.png"" src=""""/> But the less obvious effects of an algae bloom can be far more sinister. Firstly, when an algae bloom occurs, excess nutrients from chemical runoff are siphoned from the body that is effected, which is what causes cyanobacterial population to explode. However, the exponentially increased population will rapidly deplete the nutrients that allowed it to grow, and once they are exhausted, mass starvation will occur throughout the bacterial colony. The resulting decomposition from the mass death draws massive amounts of oxygen from the water, leading to the suffocation of many larger life forms, even including fish and amphibians.</p><p>The second effect of algae blooms is the toxins that accumulate when they are present in large quantities. These toxins can range across many different categories, from hematoxins to neurotoxins, but the most prevalent form is microcystin, which primarily causes liver damage, and can even result in death when ingested by many large vertebraes, including pets, cattle, and even humans (Butler, Carlisle, Linville, &amp; Washburn, 2009). In recent years, places such as lake Erie have even been affected, causing contamination that has in some cases forced over 400,000 residents of nearby towns to have to drink bottled water due to the toxins in the municipal water supply from algae blooms. (Malewitz, 2018). The effects that these cyanobacteria have has caused over $284 million in losses in Canada, and over $1 billion in losses in America in Lake Erie alone. The global damage of these blooms is immeasureable, as they have become more and more common due to climate change and increased industrialization.</p><p>In Oregon alone, there are several lakes and rivers that are directly affected by eutrophication; these would be the first places that we would target. According to the EPA, local Daphnia populations have decreased in recent years directly due to humans introducing chemicals into their water supplies (Borges, Dzubow, Orrick, &amp; Stavola, 2004). Because of this, there are few major predators that are left to consume cyanobacteria and therefore prevent blooms.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560656219/ojlu6a9unndnkcreq6ch.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>During the summers, the rise in temperature along with increased runoff due to human activity is predicted to cause a further increase in algae blooms around Oregon (""Toxic algae blooms possible in Oregon lakes and rivers as temps rise"", 2019)</p><h3> </h3><h3>OUR TEAM:</h3><p>Christopher Lea – Christopher Lea has several years of experience managing aquaculture, algae, and zooplankton, and is very skilled at both breeding and maintaining samples of exotic marine life.<br/> </p><p>Ethan Szlovak – Ethan Szlovak has skills in a variety of computer science fields, and has had an interest in marine biology since childhood.</p><p> </p><p>Robert Bosch – With several years of experience working as an United States Airforce Mechanic, Robert Bosch is well suited towards the maintenance and maintaining of all mechanical and electronic systems that will be used in our projects</p><p> </p><p>Simeon Florea – As an organic chemistry student, Simeon Florea will ensure that we are raising all samples as effectively and ethically as possible, allowing both rapid deployment and healthy living in all creatures that we raise.</p><p> </p><h2>OUR SOLUTION:</h2><p>Although cyanobacteria are toxic to humans, there are some forms of life that are not only able to consume them, but actually can rely on them as sources of food. The common water flea, (<i>Daphnia Pulex</i>) is one such species, and as it is naturally found in bodies of water around the world, we would not be risking the introduction of invasive species by using it to predate on the cyanobacterial blooms. Although astute readers may have heard of water fleas being one of top 100 worst invasive species, the species in that is listed as such is actually the fish-hook water flea, which is in an entirely different biological family (Cercopagididae) than Daphnia (Daphniidae), and therefore the introduction of Daphnia, which is already present in most lakes, would simply increase the local population back to acceptable, natural levels, which have been diminished due to the introduction of toxins, pollutants, and invasive species such as the Zebra Mussel.</p><p>After the algae bloom has been dealt with, the remaining Daphnia would simply be preyed upon by local fish and water fowl, which in turn could lead to a temporarily or permanently increased local population for both fishing and sightseeing.</p><p>Because Daphnia also exhibit a remarkable ability to adapt to new conditions, within a few generations they can be bred to selectively consume specific types of cyanobacteria.</p><p>We are only going to be using the best specimens of Daphnia from universities and companies such as Carolina Biological, or Texas University as our starting cultures, and will breed and feed them in order to acclimate them to the specific cyanobacteria that is causing the problem in the lake that we are working on clearing. We have also plans for a mobile mass growing and distribution system that we could bring to affected lakes.</p><p>In order to grow both the samples of the necessary cyanobacteria, and the Daphnia that we will be acclimating, we will be needing a larger facility in order to mass produce the algae and Daphnia, and facilitate distribution. Once we get a facility running, we will be growing many different forms of marine life for both hobbyists and professionals in order to become monetarily self sufficient so that we can sustain ourselves between large reclamation projects, and to fund this solution on a large scale. Due to the nature of this project, it is also easily scaleable and expandable to meet any scope.</p><p>This is where you come in: The money that you invest will be directly used in order to build or rent a facility in Oregon where we can begin testing. We will be using it to set up a facility, procure samples, begin research, and launch operations on areas such as the Umpqua River.</p><p><br/>With your help, we can work together towards the goal of reclaiming the beauty that these lakes once had, by restoring the nature that we have for so long neglected.</p><h2>The Scope of what we will be doing:</h2><p>The main location that we would be focusing on would be South Umpqua River in Oregon. The river is under a permanent closure due to the highly dangerous algae blooms that are present, which have resulted in the deaths of domesticated dogs and cats. One of the major causes of this is the decreased amount of Daphnia due to human activity.</p><p>We would be solving this problem by introducing large amounts of Daphnia back into their natural environment so that they can properly predate upon the cyanobacteria and make the water more aesthetically pleasing, and most importantly, safe.</p><h3>What exactly will your money be going towards?</h3><p><u><i>A Commercial Grade RO/DI Filter System</i></u></p><p>In order to properly grow and feed the necessary zooplankton and algae, ordinary tap water has too many chemicals to do the job properly. Essentially, we will be needing an industrial sized aquarium water filter to ensure that we can purify enough to keep several vats of plankton alive for testing and distribution.</p><p> </p><p><u><i>A Commecial Grade UV Filtration System</i></u></p><p>In addition to the filtration system mentioned above, we will also require a commercial grade UV Sterilization/Filtration system in order to ensure that local parasites and hitchhikers don't contaminate samples that we send to locations that could potentially be anywhere in the country, ensuring not only a high quality product, but preventing the unintentional spread of invasive species whenever possible.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><u><i>Necessary Rent for 3 Years Lease of a Small Warehouse Facility from which we can expand</i></u></p><p>This undertaking requires an area from which we can work. A simple small warehouse or pole barn will be suitable for us to launch a base of operations, from which we can expand as we get more clients and grow our business.</p><p>The minimum monthy cost of this kind of facility will be $14,000 (Excess money will go towards purchasing a larger facility)</p><p> </p><p><u><i>Freezers for long term algae storage</i></u></p><p>To ensure that we are able to quickly deploy systems in the event that we get a short-notice or long-distance contract, we will use freezers to stockpile live algae for rapid, local breeding of Daphnia or other zooplankton that are required in a cleanup operation. This will be critical for any large scale cleaning project, as the Daphnia will require large amounts of food in order to breed and grow.</p><p> </p><p><u><i>A Van for easy transportation</i></u></p><p>To move materials around the local area, and in order to help us set up, a van or some other equivalent motor vehicle will be needed.</p><p> </p><p><i><u>Basic Biological Examination Systems (Microscopes, Petri Dishes, etc etc.)</u></i></p><p>Basic lab equipment, such as microscopes, beakers, and petri dishes will allow us to conduct both on-location surveys, and help us ensure the health of specimens that we grow.</p><p> </p><p><i><u>Multiple Tank and Vat Systems</u></i></p><p>To properly grow pure samples of any product, we will need specially designed tank and vat systems in order to prevent cross contamination, and ensure that we have multiple backups in the event of disease, human error, or other unpredictable events.</p><p> </p><p><i><u>Algae Growing Tanks</u></i></p><p>In order to ensure that all zooplankton we grow are of the highest quality, various algae will be grown on-site in order to minimize transportation and cost required to maintain production.</p><p> </p><p><i><u>T-5 Algae Growth Lighting Systems</u></i></p><p>As algae is a plant, it requires light, these systems will allow us to properly provide for it.</p><p> </p><p><i><u>A Cargo Trailer for Moving Materials</u></i></p><p>We can't bring a warehouse with us, but we can bring the next best thing, a trailer equipped with a mobile lab, samples, a freezer, cover tents, and vats in order to perform on-site surveying, testing, and delivery.</p><p> </p><p><i><u>A 45 Kilowatt Emergency Generator</u></i></p><p>There are many lakes where electrical infrastructure does not reach; in these cases, we will need to bring our own power supply – that is what this is for.</p><p> </p><p><u><i>Commercial grade Refugium Tanks</i></u></p><p>In order to maintain livestock and a healthy water reserve, we will be needing one or two Commercial Refugium Tanks.</p><p> </p><h3>About the Rewards:</h3><p>Because of the nature of the rewards, there isn't a real retail value, so the %off on the rewards section doesn't really mean anything, and we also just put really big numbers in the retail value section of the rewards. Basically, everything about the rewards are in their description.</p><p>Any discounts will be given as a card with unlimited uses that will be linked into an account system in our site database, so that when you purchase anything it will be properly discounted.</p><p>It will take us at least six months to get the facilities up and running so that we can begin production and deliver rewards.</p><p>We will be growing many different species of aquarium life in order to ensure that we can stay in business, so those things will be available for you to buy.</p><p>Also, anyone who donates will get a choice whether they would like to be on the website as a supporter.</p><p>Here are some of the things that we have grown in the past and will be growing in the future:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560542641/agh1qknprjgr8gndr1i2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560542658/jqxld0pajp60b0oll4u8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560542762/jpk614x3q5qjlkrbj0ze.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560542817/rqmdckvxozyoaireodvc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560543030/gcezwxy4jb9ejh4m7v5v.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2>Partnerships</h2><p>We would be honored to maintain long term partnerships, and that requires mutual trust on both ends.

We have also plans for a mobile mass growing and distribution system that we could bring to affected lakes.In order to grow both the samples of the necessary cyanobacteria, and the Daphnia that we will be acclimating, we will be needing a larger facility in order to mass produce the algae and Daphnia, and facilitate distribution. Once we get a facility running, we will be growing many different forms of marine life for both hobbyists and professionals in order to become monetarily self sufficient so that we can sustain ourselves between large reclamation projects, and to fund this solution on a large scale. Due to the nature of this project, it is also easily scaleable and expandable to meet any scope.This is where you come in: The money that you invest will be directly used in order to build or rent a facility in Oregon where we can begin testing. We will be using it to set up a facility, procure samples, begin research, and launch operations on areas such as the Umpqua River.With your help, we can work together towards the goal of reclaiming the beauty that these lakes once had, by restoring the nature that we have for so long neglected.The Scope of what we will be doing:The main location that we would be focusing on would be South Umpqua River in Oregon. The river is under a permanent closure due to the highly dangerous algae blooms that are present, which have resulted in the deaths of domesticated dogs and cats. One of the major causes of this is the decreased amount of Daphnia due to human activity.We would be solving this problem by introducing large amounts of Daphnia back into their natural environment so that they can properly predate upon the cyanobacteria and make the water more aesthetically pleasing, and most importantly, safe.What exactly will your money be going towards?A Commercial Grade RO/DI Filter SystemIn order to properly grow and feed the necessary zooplankton and algae, ordinary tap water has too many chemicals to do the job properly. Essentially, we will be needing an industrial sized aquarium water filter to ensure that we can purify enough to keep several vats of plankton alive for testing and distribution. A Commecial Grade UV Filtration SystemIn addition to the filtration system mentioned above, we will also require a commercial grade UV Sterilization/Filtration system in order to ensure that local parasites and hitchhikers don't contaminate samples that we send to locations that could potentially be anywhere in the country, ensuring not only a high quality product, but preventing the unintentional spread of invasive species whenever possible.  Necessary Rent for 3 Years Lease of a Small Warehouse Facility from which we can expandThis undertaking requires an area from which we can work. A simple small warehouse or pole barn will be suitable for us to launch a base of operations, from which we can expand as we get more clients and grow our business.The minimum monthy cost of this kind of facility will be $14,000 (Excess money will go towards purchasing a larger facility) Freezers for long term algae storageTo ensure that we are able to quickly deploy systems in the event that we get a short-notice or long-distance contract, we will use freezers to stockpile live algae for rapid, local breeding of Daphnia or other zooplankton that are required in a cleanup operation. This will be critical for any large scale cleaning project, as the Daphnia will require large amounts of food in order to breed and grow. A Van for easy transportationTo move materials around the local area, and in order to help us set up, a van or some other equivalent motor vehicle will be needed. Basic Biological Examination Systems (Microscopes, Petri Dishes, etc etc.)Basic lab equipment, such as microscopes, beakers, and petri dishes will allow us to conduct both on-location surveys, and help us ensure the health of specimens that we grow. Multiple Tank and Vat SystemsTo properly grow pure samples of any product, we will need specially designed tank and vat systems in order to prevent cross contamination, and ensure that we have multiple backups in the event of disease, human error, or other unpredictable events. Algae Growing TanksIn order to ensure that all zooplankton we grow are of the highest quality, various algae will be grown on-site in order to minimize transportation and cost required to maintain production. T-5 Algae Growth Lighting SystemsAs algae is a plant, it requires light, these systems will allow us to properly provide for it. A Cargo Trailer for Moving MaterialsWe can't bring a warehouse with us, but we can bring the next best thing, a trailer equipped with a mobile lab, samples, a freezer, cover tents, and vats in order to perform on-site surveying, testing, and delivery. A 45 Kilowatt Emergency GeneratorThere are many lakes where electrical infrastructure does not reach; in these cases, we will need to bring our own power supply – that is what this is for. Commercial grade Refugium TanksIn order to maintain livestock and a healthy water reserve, we will be needing one or two Commercial Refugium Tanks. About the Rewards:Because of the nature of the rewards, there isn't a real retail value, so the %off on the rewards section doesn't really mean anything, and we also just put really big numbers in the retail value section of the rewards. Basically, everything about the rewards are in their description.Any discounts will be given as a card with unlimited uses that will be linked into an account system in our site database, so that when you purchase anything it will be properly discounted.It will take us at least six months to get the facilities up and running so that we can begin production and deliver rewards.We will be growing many different species of aquarium life in order to ensure that we can stay in business, so those things will be available for you to buy.Also, anyone who donates will get a choice whether they would like to be on the website as a supporter.Here are some of the things that we have grown in the past and will be growing in the future:PartnershipsWe would be honored to maintain long term partnerships, and that requires mutual trust on both ends. For that reason, we will be offering updates and progress reports at the very least, once per month, but likely even more often than that. All updates will be found on our social media.*There is a video on the way that we will be putting upOur Social MediaTwitter: @EcologyLakeFacebook: fb.me/EcologyLakeInstagram: instagram.com/lakeandrivereco/Youtube: youtube.com/channel/UCWBx3xuBIN347h4-avQfGbwSourcesBorges, S., Dzubow, C., Orrick, G., & Stavola, A.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Before my first visit to Dove Missions a few years back, I'd been to the Dominican Republic only to visit family or to relax on a resort. Hunting around for a new way to experience the country where my parents grew up, I stumbled upon Liz Rooney's work and decided to volunteer and learn more.</p>
<p>Even though I only spent five days at Dove Missions, I really connected with the students and with the leadership. I kept in touch with Liz as she and the team set up the temporary garden that I helped design, while construction on the second story of the youth center was being done.  I felt like it was somewhere I wanted to keep giving to.</p>
<p>The first incarnation of the garden was by any definition a success - both as a teaching tool and as a source of food. Meanwhile, I've been developing a master plan for the roof of the new building, which was under construction during my initial visit. </p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>This summer, I'll be heading to Puerto Plata to make the first phase of this project happen. This phase of the project will include the construction of nine raised garden beds (8' by 4') and a 3-bin composting system. The final garden will also feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>a rain water collection tank</li>
<li>hydroponic systems</li>
<li>an outdoor classroom</li>
<li>a gazebo and benches</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of Phase 1, the Dove Mission Youth Center will be able to grow hundreds of herbs and vegetables every month, while boosting students' gardening and sustainability skills. It will be a unique resource in this neighborhood, and will serve a key community building function.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Lumber, soil, compost, and tools! (And the list goes on... but you get the picture.)</p>
<p>The garden will be built over time as the money for it is raised gradually.  Regardless of wether we reach our goal through this campaign, all the money raised here will go towards the garden itself, and will not fund labor. </p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>I've been with New York Restoration Project in a community engagement role for the last six years. I've seen my share of community gardens come together! With a good team of Dove Missions staff, students, and volunteers, I'm confident we can make Phase 1 happen in just a couple of work days.</p>

With only 60 cubic metres of renewable water resources available annually per capita, Jordan is among the most water-scarce nations in the world. To supply adequate amounts of water for drinking, sanitation, industry, and agriculture, the World Bank estimates an annual per capita threshold of 1,000 cubic meters. On top of that, Jerash governorate has the lowest average of water share per capita within Jordan, with only 71 liters per day. The country is already being confronted with the effects of climate change and its resources are expected to diminish even further. At the same time, Jordan’s population is continuing to increase and the country has received more than 655,000 refugees since the beginning of the Syrian crisis. Factors such as these have resulted in the systematic overuse of its water resources for many years. If the nature and the extent of water usage are not reversed soon, the water security of Jordan’s population will be at serious risk. We will solve this problem with at least two availables techniques: rainwater harvesting and the reuse of greywater. Since winter is the only season with rainfall, we will accompany rainwater harvesting with the reuse of greywater from washing machines, kitchen sinks and showers, to flush toilets and irrigate crops. These two solutions will ensure that we will have adequate water supplies throughout the year.              </p><p style=""text-align: right;"">يعتبر شح المياه في المنطقة عقبة كبيرة في طريق انجاح هذا المشروع فكمية 60 متر مكعب سنوياً تضع الأردن في مقدمة البلدان الفقيرة من ناحيه المياه، حسب إحصائيات البنك العالمي للمياه يعتبر معدل إستهلاك الفرد بالأردن للمياه حوالي الألف متر مكعب أضف إلا ذلك اقتطاعات الحكومة من كمية المياه المستهلكة بشكل عام وبشكل خاص في المخيم ليتدنى معدل الإستهلاك إلى 71 لتر فقط يومياً في المخيم، تواجه الأردن صعوبات الاحتباس الحراري ويتزايد عدد السكان بشكل مستمر وكبير بالإضافة إلى دخول الكثير من اللاجئين السورين (حوالي 655000 لاجئ تقريباً) منذ بداية الأزمة السورية مم أثر ذلك بشكل كبير على الخزينة المائية على مر عدة سنين مما يضع ضغوطات واخطار على المجتمع الأردني من ناحية توفر الماء إلا أننا قد قمنا بوضع حلول لهذه المشكلة من خلال طريقتين : حصاد مياه الأمطار وتكرير المياه العادمة .</p><p><strong>Help us Grow!  </strong></p><p>Spread the word by sharing this page with all your friends! Follow our story on social media. </p><p>Like us on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Greeningthecamps"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>, follow us on <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/Greeningthecamps"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Instagram</a> and visit our <a href=""http://www.greeningthecamps.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. <a href=""mailto:info@greeningthecamps.com?subject=Indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Talk to us</a>.

The project, entirely run by  volunteers experienced in architecture and permaculture, is driven by our passion for environmental care and our understanding of urban design and its toolsets. Sharing and gathering knowledge, as well as creating a truly sustainable livelihood are closely linked with our devotion to enrich impoverished urban and camp areas. The multi-layered process is, on every level, guided by the ideas and desires of the local community with whom we work. Through reconnecting displaced communities with food production from urban agricultural practices, we try to create opportunities for local empowerment and economic development. الأسطح الخضراء ، هي منظمة غير ربحية حديثة الإنشاء، تعنى باستصلاح أسطح البيوت بهدف إنشاء حدائق زراعية حضرية في المخيمات الفلسطينية، يدار المشروع بالكامل من قبل مطوعين شغوفين وعلى دراية بعلم الزراعة الحضرية والتصميم، يشاركون خبراتهم بهدف تأمين حياه غذائية مستدامة لإثراء الزراعة الحضرية في المخيمات الفلسطينية، تعتمد مراحل البناء على حاجات المجتمع المحلي في المخيم معتمداً على أفكار وإقتراحات الأهالي، وبذلك نقوم بتمكين ووصل مجتمع الاجئين بالزراعة من جديد مما يمكنهم من إنتاج غذاهم بنفسهم مما يحسن وضعهم الإقتصادي والمادي Opening our first experimental garden on the rooftop of ‘Jadal for Knowledge and Culture’ in Amman enriched us with the essential experience of urban farming in the challenging natural conditions of the Middle East. Meeting a great amount of people that share a similar mindset and vision gives our team the motivation to start with the next phase: implementing the urban farming project in Jerash Refugee Camp.  مخطط المشروع : ساعدنا إنشاء الحديقة التجريبية في جدل الثقافي في عمان على تحسين وتطوير درايتنا وفهمنا للوضع العام في المنطقة ومدى تأثير مشروعنا على الوضع الراهن كما أن تعرفنا على أناس يحملون نفس انماط تفكيرنا ساعدنا كثيراً على تحسين وتطوير خطة جديدة محكمة للبدء بتطبيق المشروع في مخيم غزة في جرشWith the help of your donation, we will add a next chapter to Greening The Camps’ story. We are currently working on our Pilot Project in the camp by greening the rooftop of a vocational training school. This school will enable Palestinian refugees in the camp to learn new professional and creative skills. This initiative offers an open platform for learning and a social space where cultural activities and sharing knowledge is key. The cooperation between Greening The Camps and the vocational school will turn the rooftop into a great meeting point for people who share a similar mindset and vision and who are interested in the project. By organizing  workshops about urban agriculture, creative waste management, building and maintaining installations and growing and harvesting crops, we aim to excite members of the community in taking part in the project. Within the next 6 months our goal is to build three additional rooftop gardens in cooperation with families. We will develop gardens that have been designed to be constructed with the bare minimum of funding.With your contribution you would help us build three rooftop gardens, and make Jerash Camp a greener space.  دعمكم المادي سيساعدنا على كتابة الفصل الجديد من قصة مشروعنا، علماً بأننا قد بدئنا العمل ببناء أول حديقة على سطح مركز شبابي تطوعي بالمخيم يعنى بالتعليم الإبداعي والحرفي لاهل المخيم، يعتبر هذا المركز أو المبادرة واحة تحتضن وتنظم نشاطات ثقافية ومعرفية في المخيم فمشاركتنا وتوصلنا مع مثل هذه المبادرة يساعدنا على توفير نقطة تواصل بيننا وبين المهتمين بتحسين وضع المخيم الذين يحملون نفس نمط التفكير الذي نحمله، سنقوم بتنظيم دورات مختصة بمواضع مختلفة حول الزراعة الحضرية ،الزراعة والحصاد ،إعادة التدوير وإدارة النفايات والبناء والتركيب مستهدفين أهل المخيم مما يرفع تأثير ومشاركة المجتمع المحلي في المخيم، نهدف إلى بناء ٣ حدائق سطوح أخرى خلال فترة ال-٦ أشهر القادمة في المخيم على سطوح ٣ منازل موجودة داخل المخيم، حيث أننا قمنا بدراسة ووضع خطة محكمة لبناء حدائق أكثر إنتاجية وفعالية بأقل كلفة، دعمكم المادي سيساعدنا على بناء هذه الحدائق الثلاث مما يجعل المخيم مكاناً أكثر خضرة                 Rewards€5 - Good KarmaSending you green vibes and positive energy! Thank you for being part of our story!€10 - Palestinian ChefThis is the easiest way to pitch in a few bucks and get a personal thank you card with a traditional Palestinian recipe on the back. €25- Urban Farmer Become an urban farmer yourself!

<h2>*** DECEMBER 9, 2019 UPDATE ***</h2>
<p>On 12/9/19 we received word that the Supreme Court will not hear the case. While unfortunate, this decision does not diminish the importance of this considerable effort to elevate this issue to the highest court in the land.</p>
<p>We fought hard for this issue and although we did not see the outcome we hoped for, it was worth the fight. We will continue to do everything we can to protect clean water.</p>
<p>Thank you to all our campaign backers for your contributions, which will go toward the $100,000 in legal fees incurred during this petitioning process.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s decision to deny our petition shifts the focus to the Trump Administration rulemaking on implementation of the Clean Water Act, including state authority under section 401. In our opinion, the proposed rule is misguided and largely unconstitutional, but done correctly the rulemaking could restore common sense to this area of law.</p>
<p>Your support for this cause remains vital, as the outcome will affect whether rivers across the country have sufficient cold, clean water. We encourage everyone to stay involved by following <a href=""https://caltrout.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CalTrout</a> and <a href=""https://www.tu.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trout Unlimited</a>.

<h2><i>Overview</i></h2>
<p><a href=""https://caltrout.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">California Trout</a> and <a href=""https://www.tu.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trout Unlimited</a> are teaming up to defend clean water across the country. <strong>We're taking our case to the U.S. Supreme Court and we need your help.</strong></p>
<p>The ability of every state to enforce Clean Water Act protections on their own rivers and waterways is under major threat, an unfortunate and unintended consequence of litigation stemming from the Klamath River dam removal project along the California and Oregon border.</p>
<p><strong>If a recent D.C. circuit court ruling stands, federal projects across the country—including hydroelectric dams and natural gas pipelines—could operate for 50 years or more without state requirements to protect river flows, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and other variables that dramatically affect water quality and sustainability.</strong></p>
<p>Our aim is to convince the Supreme Court to reinstate every state's sovereignty over its own clean water standards, by ensuring that states have adequate time to perform the required studies of the impacts of such projects.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The current case presented to the US Supreme Court emerged from the Klamath Basin, where a broad group of stakeholders—including California Trout and Trout Unlimited, the states of Oregon and California, the Yurok, Karuk, and Klamath Tribes, commercial fishing and conservation groups, and the electric utility PacifiCorp—reached a historic settlement to remove four dams on the Klamath River, the largest dam removal and river restoration project in the country.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>The Hoopa Valley Tribe, which also supports dam removal, grew impatient with the temporary re-licensing tactics implemented by PacifiCorp that allowed the utility company to operate their dams without complying with the Clean Water Act and other environmental provisions. In an effort to expedite the dam removal process by ending the continuous temporary re-licensing, the Hoopa Valley Tribe filed suit against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).</p>

<p>The circuit court ruling on the Hoopa Valley Tribe's lawsuit found that FERC was not required to expedite dam removal. The court also found that, despite the delay being agreed to by the utility to analyze the environmental effects of the project, the affected states had effectively waived their rights to certify that the project would meet water quality standards.</p>
<p>Thus, the court's decision weakened the ability for all states to protect their clean water through their own water quality standards.</p>
<p>Section 401 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) gives states the sole power to enforce water quality standards on federal projects within state borders—projects including the creation, operation, or removal of hydroelectric dams and natural gas pipelines. The catch is that the statute requires states to act within one year of the application. However, in most cases, one year is not adequate time to perform the studies necessary to assess project impacts on water quality and establish required conditions for complying with a state's water quality standards.</p>
<p>However, a procedural workaround evolved. Applicants frequently withdraw and re-submit their applications before the one-year deadline, in order to ""reset the clock."" This procedure has been used by states and license applicants around the country and endorsed by FERC, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and federal courts.</p>
<p>The D.C. Circuit court decision is already being broadly interpreted as having negated this ""withdraw and submit"" process, and has quickly become a major threat to rivers across the country.

The Case

 
The current case presented to the US Supreme Court emerged from the Klamath Basin, where a broad group of stakeholders—including California Trout and Trout Unlimited, the states of Oregon and California, the Yurok, Karuk, and Klamath Tribes, commercial fishing and conservation groups, and the electric utility PacifiCorp—reached a historic settlement to remove four dams on the Klamath River, the largest dam removal and river restoration project in the country.

In an effort to expedite the dam removal process by ending the continuous temporary re-licensing, the Hoopa Valley Tribe filed suit against the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
 
The Decision

The circuit court ruling on the Hoopa Valley Tribe's lawsuit found that FERC was not required to expedite dam removal. The court also found that, despite the delay being agreed to by the utility to analyze the environmental effects of the project, the affected states had effectively waived their rights to certify that the project would meet water quality standards.

The D.C. Circuit court decision is already being broadly interpreted as having negated this ""withdraw and submit"" process, and has quickly become a major threat to rivers across the country. Already, we have seen states' rights waived on rivers in California, North Carolina, and New York.
If this interpretation stands, federal projects could go 50+ years without state certification for water quality, leaving every state's precious waterways without protection.
California Trout and Trout Unlimited—with the expressed support of 21 states across the country—has petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States to reestablish the accepted practice of ""withdraw and submit"" as a means of enabling states to retain their ability to establish water quality protections for dams, pipelines, and other federal projects.

There is a need for funding to cover the expense of litigation to elevate this case to the highest court in the nation -- the only venue that can reverse the problematic lower court decision. Litigation is expensive but is sometimes the only recourse for defending our bedrock environmental laws. The costs of litigation are high but the environmental costs of failing to act are far greater.
California Trout and Trout Unlimited have provided fantastic perks to help raise the needed funds. Perks include stickers, note cards, cups, hats, and exclusive trips. Scroll above to find out more about what you can receive with your donation today.
100% of funds raised by this campaign will go toward legal fees associated with bringing our case to the Supreme Court of the United States. All donations will be split evenly between California Trout and Trout Unlimited to offset shared expenses.

<h3>The Idea:</h3>
<p>This summer, we plan on dropping our air-conditioned offices, put our life on the line for a good cause and getting ourselves a grand old adventure!</p>
<p>So, we thought, what’s more unpredictable than driving 16000+ km from Milan to Mongolia for charity in a old van whose most glorious days were back in 1970s? </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The overall situation should look something similar to this!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498292694/mcmqapzt5z9ozxnfcmbz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is the Mongol Rally:</h3>
<p>Easy, the biggest charity rally worldwide!</p>
<p>The race is organized by a British group called <a href=""http://www.theadventurists.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Adventurists</a>, and attracts teams from nearly every corner of the world. The route begins in London and ends 10,000 miles later in Ulan-Ude, Siberia. The Mongol Rally has only three very simple rules :</p>
<ul>
<li>Teams must only drive a comically inappropriate car with an engine smaller than 1000cc.</li>
<li>Teams are completely and utterly on their own on the road without any backup</li>
<li>Each team must raise at least £1000 for charity.</li>
</ul>
<p>And obviously, drivers are not given any advice or instruction on how to ride the 16000 km and arrive at their final destination...</p>
<p>Our adventure will take us through 20 countries, passing through ancient routes as the silk road and Pamir highway ( one of the highest road in the world )! We will depart from Milan on July 13 and, avoiding breakdowns, fords crossing and hawk hunters we are expected to arrive in Ulaan Udè by the beginning of September. From Milan we'll go to London and then througth the Balkans, Turkey and Iran, from where we'll enter in Turkmenistan and in the 'Stans republics reaching Russia and finally Mongolia. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You may think think we will spend most of our time driving..but actually we expect to spend it like this..</p>

<li>All we have to offer is this amazing adventure, and everything we can get from it. Pictures, videos, gifts, white russian with russian goat milk?</li>
<li>In any case everything we raise from this campain will go into charity, both in case we don't achieve our goal and if we overcome it!</li>

<h3>In A Nutshell</h3>
<p>The Buenavista National High School Environmental Club is a group of students dedicated to spreading environmental awareness through their community. In the Club's short life of only 2 years, the students have implemented many successful projects, including a mobile awareness workshop where they traveled to neighboring high schools, and the town's first ever environmental camp, which happened last October.</p>
<p>Now, experienced representatives of the Club would like to travel to Baguio City, where the national Youth for Environment Summer (YES!) Camp will be held this May 1-5, 2012. At the national camp, these students will share their Club's successes and become role models to students from all around the Philippines. They will also learn more about the environmental issues plaguing their country and how to continue educating the youth.</p>
<p>Bea, Jeremiah and John John, along with their teacher Miss Sadiwa, need your help so that they can make the trip to Baguio City a reality. Your contribution will go toward the 5-day camp's registration fee, as well as the travel expenses of the four people.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Bea, John Jake, Jeremiah and their teacher Miss Sadiwa will travel for 20 hours via jeepney, boat, bus and tricycle to reach the YES! Camp in Baguio City, from their town of Buenavista on the island of Marinduque. Once they arrive, they will pay a registration fee for the 5 day camp that will cover their food and lodging. That's where we need your help!</p>
<p>Cost Breakdown</p>
<p>$388 Travel from Buenavista to Baguio City (4 people)</p>
<p>$464 Registration fee for the 5-day camp (4 people)</p>
<p>$148 Processing and Handling Fees</p>
<p><em>TOTAL BUDGET - $1,000</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Through their participation in the Youth for Environment Summer Camp in Baguio City, our three outstanding young environmentalists will continue to be an inspiration to the youth of the Philippines. They will gain confidence through their interactions with national government officials, and will network with neighboring regions to continue the work that they have been doing. </p>
<p>The Philippines is one of the most critically endangered environments on the planet, and the change won't begin anywhere else but with the youth. Our students recognize that fact and are working hard to make little big changes wherever they can!</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>

<div>
<p>We appreciate your support, even if it is not in monetary means! You can help us get to Baguio by posting this campaign on your Facebook, and encouraging family and friends to donate!</p>

<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>My name is Jennifer Adams and I am a 2011 graduate of University of Colorado in Boulder.  More recently, I just finished with my 10 months of service with AmeriCorps NCCC.  It was through that program that I realized my passion for service and non-profit work.  So, after a couple short months of working at a bank, it's time to get back to what I love doing most - volunteering, connecting with communities, and bringing awareness to some very unique and amazing non-profits. </p>
<p>My goal is to volunteer for approximately a year (depending on funding) in Central America with small non-profits and organizations.  I am addicted to non-profit work and even though their is a likelihood that this trip will end with a phone call to my mother, asking her to lend me money for a plane ticket home, or a bus ticket to my sister's house in Mexico, it will be worth it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding I need for this trek is primarily just for travel expenses.  Exit and entry fees are common ($28 exit fee for Costa Rica, $10 entry fee for Nicaragua, $32 exit fee for Nicaragua).  I am packing a tent, so hopefully I can camp when housing isn't available.  However, especially when working with non-profits in an urban setting, housing will be a necessary expense.  It is because of this that I do not have a determined non-profit schedule yet - certain non-profits will be more feasible than others.  Closer to the funding deadline, I will be able to determine if I can afford to stay in cities to volunteer with non-profits (approximately $50-$100 a week) or if I will be limited to non-profits that can provide housing or have the area to provide a camping spot. </p>
The best part about helping to fund this project is that even if I do not reach my goal, this journey is still going to happen - it just won't be for as long of a period of time.  Every dollar can help - whether it pays for a night of camping, a bus ticket, or a taxi ride those last few miles to the small town where the non-profit is working. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So what do you get? Unfortunately, I can't offer any prizes that cost a lot of money.  This journey is non-profit, and as every dollar I save means more time I get to help non-profits, I can't afford it.  However, what I can afford are gifts of creativity, art, photography, and my never-ending gratitude. I will write and record you a song, take a picture just for you, write you a poem, and send you a thank you note. </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can't quantify the impact my volunteering will make (yet).  On the start date of this campaign, I am driving to Denver International Ariport, and getting on a plane taking me to San Jose, Costa Rica.  From there, I am headed to Refugio Mixto de Vida Silvestre Romelia, where I will be volunteering as a research assistant for the refuge.  For an idea of where I will be, as well as opportunities for you to volunteer, go to <a href=""http://www.tropical"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tropicaladventures.com</a> or check out Tropical Adventures on Facebook.  They are a registered 501(c)(3) with the IRS in the USA.  </p>
<p>I have the money to volunteer for approximately 3 months, including my trip to Nicaragua, which is necessary to renew my Visa in Costa Rica.  Hopefully, I will have the money to stay longer - I am trying to budget approximately $80 a month for expenses.  It is from there however, that I need your help.  I would like to volunteer with and bring awareness to other causes and non-profit organizations in the surrounding countries.  I can not only work for these organizations, but also spread the word about what they do and attract future volunteers.</p>
<p>Your contribution will fund volunteer work once I leave my research assistant position in Romelia.  Depending on the success of funding, I am looking to volunteer with several non-profits in Nicaragua, Guatamala, Belize, and Mexico.  Potential non-profits include: The Sweet Water Fund,</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I would love your help connecting with non-profit organizations or causes in Central America.  I have a list of organizations I have contacted, but if you know of any volunteer opportunities, non-profit organizations, or have family or friends in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatamala, Honduras, Belize, or Mexico, please let me know. </p>
<p><br/>I would also love recommendations of hostels, gear, ways to get around - anything that would be helpful for a traveling volunteer on a budget. </p>
<p><br/>And finally, please follow my blog, twitter, and youtube.  Anything to help get the word out about these beautiful countries and wonderful organizations and causes I will be working for. </p>

The aztecs developed a system of floating gardens based on hydroponics, driven out of their land, they settled in what is now Mexico City. Unable to grow crops at the lake shore they built rafts out of reeds and roots. These rafts were topped with a bit of soil from the bottom of the lake, and worked perfectly as growing platforms.  </blockquote><p><br/></p><p><b>Design Requirements (Technical Specifications**) </b></p><blockquote>A hydroponic system is designed to fulfill the specific requirements of plants with the most reliable and efficient methods) of nutrient delivery. The three major plant-requirements that a hydroponic system must satisfy are:</blockquote><blockquote>
<br/>1) Provide roots with a fresh, well balanced supply of water and nutrients</blockquote><blockquote>
<br/>2) Maintain a high level of gas exchange between nutrient solution and roots.</blockquote><blockquote>
<br/>3) Protect against root dehydration and immediate crop failure in the event of a pump failure or power outage.</blockquote><blockquote>
<br/>Hydroponic systems can be either active or passive. An active system includes a mechanical means for recirculating the nutrient solution, while a passive system relies on capillary action,absorption, and/or the force of gravity to replenish roots with nutrient. Besides being generally more efficient, and therefore more productive, a nice feature of active hydroponic system is how easily they can be implemented in an automated greenhouse.The automation system does not have to be complicated to provide outstanding results. Just as a fan may be connected to a thermostat to control temperature, a timer may be connected to a pump to deliver nutrients to the plants as necessary. If such a system is designed properly,a large nutrient reservoir could feed the crop for weeks before needing a refill. In this scenario, as long as the system is reliable, the garden will continue to thrive indefinitely without the need for continual supervision.<br/>For a hydroponic system to be considered reliable, we must insure that the three major plant requirements are met on consistent basis. Efficiency is just as important because it will define your operating expenses, and in some cases can even disrupting the growing environment. The best way to build a reliable, efficient system is through intelligent engineering.</blockquote><br/><p></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">Partners &amp; Supporters</b><br/></p><blockquote>We have the support &amp; endorsement of one of Boston’s leading venture accelerators NU IDEA; that has provided us with valuable guidance, resources and capabilities.<br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In addition EcoSynergy has built a network of Collaborators, strategic partners, investors, entrepreneurs and well established Organizations</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> in up to 3 different countries.

<p></p></div>","EcoSynergy the farm of the future for           the people of the future! 

Our mission is to change the inefficient and harmful effects of agriculture. We have been farming the same way for thousands of years and little has changed. 
                                 BUT...WHY?
The answer is simple; big corporations  are heavily lobbying against regulatory laws that would prove their quality to be below that consider ""SAFE"". Both the USA & Mexico have suffered an exponential growth in Obesity rates that can be directly tracked to increase presence of substances like CORN SYRUP. 
Derived from corn as the name indicates. This ""Syrup"" is actually a chemical extract of a corn plant that has already been modified genetically, impregnated with countless chemicals & pesticides. Its high fructose levels have a destructive effect on our bloods levels of glucose. It also blocks a chemical reaction in your brain responsible of telling you when you are not hungry anymore. (Making you addicted to food)Lets try a little experiment together;Go to your FRIDGE
Open it, Grab 4 OR 5 LABELED PRODUCTS  AND LOOK FOR ""CORN SYRUP""THE AMOUNT OF CORN SYRUP YOU CONSUMER PER DAY WITHOUT KNOWING. 
Its just horrifying.  
Not to mention the damage to the ENVIRONMENT. Corporations disregard quality and safety of the consumer
The REASON: Lower CostsBut what if we could find a better way of farming? A way of producing food without pesticides or modifications of any sort, in an eco-friendly way. That was the question in our team's mind,
 how could we redesign our farms to be efficient, safe and ecologically friendly. 
 And for a long time that question motivated us to do extensive research, to talk to the suppliers, vendors and to gain a knowledgeable insight  of the problem. 
The answer came to us as we stumbled on alternative agronomic methods. It was a surprise because the answer was so simple (yet not so simplistic), to farm using water without soil or Hydroponics
                                 ...Thats how we developed a                     new approach to farming...          WE BRING TO YOU                       The ""Auxo"" farmHELP US HELP YOUR DIET, THE ENVIRONMENT & AND THE WORLD. 
Raising $30,000 we can build our ""AUXO""  farm, capable of growing all sorts of berries, vegetables & other greenly leafs. This farm will allow us to perfect our system, lower total construction costs and develop a replicable model that is financially sustainable. Our farms can be easily transported and can grow crops anywhere regardless of the external weather conditions, something no other farm can do. Below are some of the benefits!
                                                      90% less water                                                   10x times more food                                                       3x times faster                                  No chemicals, No pesticides, No Soil       100% organic process       Help us alleviate hunger!ALL the production of our first harvests will be directed towards fulfilling our Contributors who helped us with the ""Get your basket"" perk and the to be donated to charity, helping undernourished children have a healthier diet.
WE are committed to help reduce hunger in the world and hopefully one day eliminate it. 
Even more important, we are convinced it will empower poor communities to have access to high quality food at an affordable price, like it should be. Our ""ECO -Systems""
 Our farm systems are precisely design to utilize the least amount of resources while maximizing crop output.

   Just a thought...What if i could feed you the perfect diet for you, at the perfect time, all the time? Well you will be the most healthy human being, and thats exactly what we can do for plants, without the need to modify them or add any sort of chemical we are able to provide the optimal growing conditions and diet so the plant as we say, ""Grows Happy and healthy""                    Blue prints (technical specifications) (Our Berry farm)         Grows of all kind of berries using a  Rotatory vertical cylinder system (RVCS). Equipped with an irrigation system designed to supply a constant stream of water throughout the middle of the vertical Cylinders, this unit saves space and water. The lighting system is tailored to this vertical growing method using hanging LED lights between each cylinder. In terms of production per square foot this is by far the most efficient model we have developed, capable of producing aprox. 1800 lbs of strawberries every 2 months. This is just the beginning!If we raise the $100,000 we expect to build our advanced TRIO farm, a 3 unit container connected to improve resource utilization and increase yield production + FISH!The ""TRIO Farm"" is a three container unit that is capable of growing all of the produce our AUXO farm is capable of, with a unique addition: fish.                                                   FISH? YES FISH!!  This unique farm is our aquaponis model; we call it the""Aqua unit"". Designed with a special water tank capable of growing over 700 pounds of fish every six weeks with an ideal space utilization and water usage. The fish waste can be used as a source of rich mineral nutrients to feed the plants. These are synergies that occur naturally in ecosystems and that have multiple benefits. Boosting productivity, quality and taste of the produce; such as lettuce,tomatoes and/or strawberries among many others. Aqua Unit Blue prints (Germination stage included)Auxo Blue prints (2 set ups: Berris & herbs, Vegtables)I.C.M.S. or Interconnected Modular system (Patent Pending)  Connected throughout our unique I.C.M.S. or Interconnected Modular system that allows for an intelligent allocation of resources & Meta data sharing.       We believe on S.T.E.M.; the applicable academic discipline of Combining                       Science, Technology, engineering, and mathematics.Each Unit has an intelligent monitoring system in charge of measuring, recording and analyzing all the elemental metrics of the conditions inside each container and stream live data to a central computer that can be accessed remotely via mobile app or via PC. This way we can measure, modify and optimize the synergies and conditions for both plants and fish throughout a comprehensive interface.                                                                 *Yield*To get a better idea, 1 Acre of traditional agriculture produces in 1 year in avg. about 45,000 heads of lettuce, our systems will be able to produce over 4 MILLION!! heads of lettuce per year!Hydroponics has actually been around for Thousands of years!!The famous hanging gardens of babylon, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, were based on the principles of hydroponics. The aztecs developed a system of floating gardens based on hydroponics, driven out of their land, they settled in what is now Mexico City. Unable to grow crops at the lake shore they built rafts out of reeds and roots. These rafts were topped with a bit of soil from the bottom of the lake, and worked perfectly as growing platforms.  Design Requirements (Technical Specifications**) A hydroponic system is designed to fulfill the specific requirements of plants with the most reliable and efficient methods) of nutrient delivery. The three major plant-requirements that a hydroponic system must satisfy are:
1) Provide roots with a fresh, well balanced supply of water and nutrients
2) Maintain a high level of gas exchange between nutrient solution and roots.
3) Protect against root dehydration and immediate crop failure in the event of a pump failure or power outage.
Hydroponic systems can be either active or passive. An active system includes a mechanical means for recirculating the nutrient solution, while a passive system relies on capillary action,absorption, and/or the force of gravity to replenish roots with nutrient. Besides being generally more efficient, and therefore more productive, a nice feature of active hydroponic system is how easily they can be implemented in an automated greenhouse.The automation system does not have to be complicated to provide outstanding results. Just as a fan may be connected to a thermostat to control temperature, a timer may be connected to a pump to deliver nutrients to the plants as necessary. If such a system is designed properly,a large nutrient reservoir could feed the crop for weeks before needing a refill. In this scenario, as long as the system is reliable, the garden will continue to thrive indefinitely without the need for continual supervision.For a hydroponic system to be considered reliable, we must insure that the three major plant requirements are met on consistent basis. Efficiency is just as important because it will define your operating expenses, and in some cases can even disrupting the growing environment. The best way to build a reliable, efficient system is through intelligent engineering.Partners & SupportersWe have the support & endorsement of one of Boston’s leading venture accelerators NU IDEA; that has provided us with valuable guidance, resources and capabilities.In addition EcoSynergy has built a network of Collaborators, strategic partners, investors, entrepreneurs and well established Organizations in up to 3 different countries.

<h2>Help Create a Less Wasteful Future: Take the Waste Out of Takeout!<br/>
</h2>
<p>
<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">We are on a
quest to make the world a better, cleaner, less wasteful place, and we’re
starting with takeout containers. BizeeBox<sup>TM</sup> drastically reduces the
need for disposable takeout containers by offering the easiest-to-use, most
technologically advanced reusable takeout container service in the United
States. </span><br/></p>
<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">
<p>What is a “reusable
takeout container service,” you ask? Well, after you <b><i>sign up for BizeeBox for free,</i></b>
it basically works like this:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You ask for a </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">BizeeBox container </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">when you order takeout food or take leftovers home from a restaurant</span>

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">check

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You enjoy your food when and where you want,
then </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">return the container</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> to one of

<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">
<p>The only
differences between our model and the disposable takeout container model are
that you have to check out and return the containers. Our technology will make
the check out process simple. And returning containers will become easier and
easier as we sign up restaurants and add return locations. Our grand vision is
that eventually you’ll be able to return our containers on every city street
corner and every restaurant, grocery store, office building, airport, mall, and
other food service establishment in the country. Imagine getting takeout at the
airport, bringing it on the plane, and returning it to the flight attendant! </p>
</span>
<p><span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">BizeeBox
uses sturdy, dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe, and BPA-free </span>plastic<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> containers. That means they are also great for storing and
reheating leftovers. You can also use them to bring lunch to work or school,
just like any regular lunchbox. You can even check out as many containers as you like.

</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">All we ask
is that you </span><b><i>return each container to us in good condition within 30 days of
checking it out</i></b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">. After that, we have to charge you a replacement fee because,
well, these awesome containers are expensive and we can’t just give them away
for free!</span></p></span>
<h2>Why is takeout container waste such a
big issue?</h2>
<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">
<p>All takeout containers require materials, energy, and
water to manufacture and are usually transported a long distance before they end up at a restaurant. And then, after being used only once, most end up in landfills or, even worse, polluting local ecosystems and clogging waterways. This is even true for recyclable, compostable, and biodegradable containers (see our FAQ below or check out <a href=""http://bizeebox.com/2013/08/06/why-reuse-makes-sense/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our blog</a> for more on this). Meanwhile, taxpayers bear the economic burdens of waste management, litter cleanup, and repairing damaged ecosystems.</p>
<p>So not only are there environmental benefits to reducing the use of disposable takeout containers, but the more containers we keep out of the waste stream and our environment,
the more tax dollars will be freed up for other purposes. Even better, we’ll
create a few local jobs because we’ll need people to collect, clean, and
redistribute takeout containers.</p>
</span>
<h2>How big of a difference can we make?</h2>
<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">
<p>We are starting
BizeeBox in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a college town with approximately 300
restaurants serving a population of 115,000. By our estimates, Ann Arbor restaurants
serve at least 2 million disposable takeout containers per year. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Since each takeout
container we offer can be reused over 350 times before it needs to be recycled,
BizeeBox can meet Ann Arbor’s needs with <b><i>less than 1% of the containers.</i></b> That’s
10,000 BizeeBox containers rather than 2 million disposable containers! To put
this in perspective …</p>
<ul style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">
<li>
<b>By weight</b>:
This is the same as keeping more than 100 tons out of the waste stream per year. </li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By volume:
</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If you don’t crush them, that many containers would fill approximately 700
average dump trucks.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By
height: </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If you stacked 2 million standard clamshell containers one on top
of the other, you’d have a tower nearly 100 miles tall. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
</span>
<p><span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;""><b><i>And that’s just Ann
Arbor</i></b>! Nationally
it works out to something like <b>18
million</b> reusable containers instead of <b>5
billion </b>disposable containers. It’s an understatement to say that’s a lot
of containers we could keep out of the waste stream and our environment. Doesn’t
this sound like a win, win, win scenario? </span></p>
</span>
<h2>Who are we, and why are we doing
this?</h2>
<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/76448/files/20130915205334-Circle-Heads.jpg?1379303614"" src="""" style=""width: 225px; height: 397px;""/>We are Rich
Grousset (bald) and Phel Meyer (bearded), and we are <a href=""http://www.bizeebox.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BizeeBox</a>. We met in graduate school and immediately
bonded over our shared distaste for waste (i.e. we don’t like trash). </p>
<p>We also had
a few other things in common, including our passions for food and ordering
takeout from local restaurants. The more we talked, though, the more we became frustrated
by the number of takeout containers we were throwing away after only one use. So
we started asking ourselves: does this make sense? Is it really necessary?  </p>
<p></p>
<p>That’s
how we started thinking about and researching takeout container waste. We
learned that hundreds of U.S. colleges have begun addressing the issue by implementing
reusable takeout container programs, and there are even a few small businesses out
there doing it as well. But we also found that nobody was addressing the issue
on a large scale. We saw an opportunity to step in and make a difference.</p>
<p>To be
certain this all wasn’t just a fluke, we launched the University of Michigan’s
very first reusable takeout container program. What happened? It was a huge
success, and after just a few weeks, about <b><i>half of the restaurant’s to-go diners</i></b>
were using our containers every day! What’s more, we got a ton of positive
feedback from faculty, staff, and students.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/76430/files/20130915203657-GBB_Feedback_-_Wordle_2.jpg?1379302617"" src="""" style=""width: 637.081081081081px; height: 166px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We were thrilled
to discover that we’re not the only ones tired of creating unnecessary waste
and that people are willing to embrace reuse if given the opportunity. But now
someone needs to take the initiative to develop a financially viable<span> </span>reusable takeout container service that
can expand to every city in the country. We want to be that someone and could not
be more excited by the opportunity to launch a business that aligns perfectly with
our values. <b><i>Help us be that someone … Help us take the waste out of takeout!</i></b></p></span>
<h2>What do we need?</h2>
<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">
<p>We are
seeking $30,000, which will allow us to launch a small-scale operation in Ann
Arbor. To do that, we need: </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Containers</b> (~$7,000): We need to purchase 1500 containers,
which is enough to get us started at the first few restaurants.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Collection Boxes</b> (~$3,000): We need to buy
and brand our very own bins people can use to return the containers. We’ll buy 6, put
one in or near each participating restaurant, and add a few additional
ones in prime locations around town.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Operations</b> (~$5,000): This will help us pay for transportation
and dishwashing costs for at least the first few months.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Technology</b> (~$15,000): This will help us begin
developing our smartphone application and web site, which are pivotal to our
success!<br/>
</li></ul></span>
<p>
<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">
After we learn from our experience in Ann Arbor,
we will expand to every other city where reuse makes sense. Will your city be
next?</span></p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<span style=""font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 20px; color: #444;"">
<p><b><i>Wait, is this clean and
safe? I don’t like the idea of using someone else’s container.</i></b></p>
<p>Yes!
BizeeBox containers are just as clean as anything else you’re going to eat off
of. In fact, we’d venture to say that we’d rather eat off something we cleaned locally
than something that was manufactured, boxed up, shipped thousands of miles, and
stored in a warehouse!</p>
<p>The cleaning
and sanitizing standards we use are the same as those required of restaurants. We
clean Bizeebox containers using commercial dishwashing equipment in a regularly
inspected facility. After cleaning, the containers are examined by a trained Bizeebox
staff member. If you are interested in learning more about the regulations
governing these procedures, you can read the U.S. Food &amp; Drug
Administration’s cleaning and sanitizing standards in <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodCode/ucm188064.htm#part4-6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chapter 4 of its Food Code</a>. </p>
<p><b><i>Wouldn’t it be simpler
if I just brought my own clean container to the restaurant and asked them to
serve my food in it? </i></b></p>
<p>The simple
answer is, yes! And some enthusiastic waste reducers try to do just that. Unfortunately,
there are two important issues with this. First,
<a href=""http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodCode/ucm188064.htm#part4-6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the FDA’s Food Code</a> (see 4-603.17: “Returnables, Cleaning for Refilling”) <b>prohibits restaurants from serving
food in a container brought in to the establishment by a customer</b> (beverage
containers, like coffee mugs, are exempt from this rule). This is to protect us
all in case a customer does not completely sanitize their container and it somehow
ends up contaminating food served to others. You are allowed, however, to take
leftovers from your plate and put them in a container you brought in. But we
don’t think asking people to do this is a systematic solution to the problem. </p>
<p>That leads
to the second key issue: <i>behavior change</i>.
<b>Even if people could bring their own containers, how many people would?</b> They
would have to always clean the container themselves and either (a) carry it
around all the time until they needed it, or (b) always remember to bring it
along on the specific days they think they will use it. We believe our system
is easier: you bring back your used (dirty) containers to return receptacles
when it makes sense for you, and you are free to pick up a new container
whenever you want. You do <u>not</u> need to bring in the old one <i>at the same time</i> as you pick up a new
one!</p>
<p><b><i>What if people don’t
return their BizeeBox containers?</i></b></p>
<p>Only diners
who are signed up for the program are allowed to take food to-go in a BizeeBox
container. We don’t require a deposit up front, but we will charge diners for any
containers they don’t return within thirty (30) days. In this way, we ensure
that (a) we aren’t giving out expensive containers for free, and (b) people are
incentivized to bring their containers back!</p>
<p><b><i>What about recyclable,
compostable, or biodegradable containers? Aren’t those enough?</i></b></p>
<p>That’s a very important question! First,
every time a reusable takeout container is used, that’s one less single-use
container manufactured for just one meal. Each of those disposables needs to be
manufactured, shipped a long way, and cared for at its end-of-life, leading to
significant environmental impacts. Second, given today’s infrastructure and
consumer behavior, most disposable containers still end up in the landfill,
regardless of whether or not they could be recycled or composted. And finally,
reusable takeout containers enable more economic activity to happen locally. We
pay people to collect, clean, and redistribute the containers locally rather
than paying manufacturers and distributors to make and ship containers a long
distance.</p>
<p>The best available research says that
if reusable takeout containers are in fact reused hundreds of times, which our
system is set up to ensure, then they are environmentally preferable to
recyclable, compostable, and biodegradable containers. Be sure to check out our
blog posts on the <a href=""http://bizeebox.com/2013/08/06/why-reuse-makes-sense/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">benefits of reuse</a> and don’t hesitate to contact us if you want more
information!</p>
<p><b><i>What are the containers
made of? Are they BPA-free?</i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>The
containers BizeeBox currently uses are made from #5 polypropylene (PP) plastic,
are BPA-free and are <a href=""http://www.nsf.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.nsf.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NSF certified</a>. They are manufactured in China and
sold in the U.S. by G.E.T. Enterprises, a restaurant supplier based in Houston, Texas. We did not design these containers, nor do we manufacture them; what we do is make these containers available to as many people as possible. </p>
<p>Like most
plastic, PP is made from petroleum, which is <i>not </i>a renewable resource (we know … this pains us to think about
too!). The good news is that, as we mentioned above, reusable plastic
containers are still preferable to anything else on the market when you look at the entire lifecycle of the product.</p>
<p><b><i>How will BizeeBox make
money after you run out of Indiegogo money? Or is this a non-profit?</i></b></p>
<p>BizeeBox is
a for-profit venture. We will make money by charging restaurants a
per-container usage fee just like they currently pay for disposable takeout
containers, selling advertising, and offering marketing services based on the
data we gather. We have a business plan based on several years’ of research,
but most investors want proof of concept for a new idea like this with an
uncertain demand. So we’re out to prove not only that people are ready to
embrace reusable takeout containers, but that our service can be profitable.
Our plan is to test all of the research-based estimates and assumptions in our
business plan so that we can then make the case to investors, restaurants, and
cities that our model makes sense everywhere.</p>
<p><b><i>Wait, but won’t the
collection bins get smelly and attract vermin?</i></b></p>
<p>Our
experience launching a reusable takeout container program while in school
showed that as long as the return receptacles are emptied on a daily basis,
there are no problems. Our bins will be sturdy and hard to break into, and we
will empty them daily (or more often, if necessary) while also cleaning them on
a regular basis. We are therefore confident that they will stay clean, shiny,
and safe 365 days a year!</p>
<p><b><i>Do containers get
stained or fall apart if they’re used too many times?</i></b></p>
<p>The
containers we buy have been tested in hundreds of places by thousands of
customers and typically last for more than 350 uses. In fact, in our experience,
the containers have a breakage rate of less than 1%. Even better, they don’t
stain, even if you fill them with BBQ sauce or Chicken Tikka Masala. As long as
they go through a commercial dishwasher (which they will), then there are no
problems!</p>
<p>And you
don’t have to worry that you’re getting an old, beat-up container, because
we’re tracking each one and will make sure that they are recycled once they
reach the end of their “life.” </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><i>Can I put BizeeBox
containers in my own dishwasher or microwave?</i></b></p>
<p>Yes, you sure
can! You can use them to heat up leftovers in the microwave and clean them in
your dishwasher. Keep in mind, though, that since these are plastic containers,
you cannot place them on stovetops, in ovens, or on any other similarly hot
surfaces because the containers will melt and/or be damaged.</p>
<p><b><i>Where will I be able to
pick up food in a BizeeBox container once I sign up for the program?</i></b></p>
<p>You will be
able to take food to-go in a BizeeBox container at any participating
restaurant. We will try our best to get as many restaurants on board as
possible, as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you’re sick of your
containers ending up in the landfill, let your favorite restaurant owner know
that you want them to start using BizeeBox! </p>

any other questions, please email us or post a comment. Thank you! You rock!</p>

Fast Company and Grist ran great pieces on BizeeBox last week. One Green Planet and PSFK published great stories this week, and Elevatr featured Phel and Rich in their Entrepreneur of the Week column! And don't forget to check out Rich's blog post in EDF Business and Phel's How-To in Shareable.
We definitely recommended taking a read-through and sharing the good news!
Help Create a Less Wasteful Future: Take the Waste Out of Takeout!


We are on a
quest to make the world a better, cleaner, less wasteful place, and we’re
starting with takeout containers. BizeeBoxTM drastically reduces the
need for disposable takeout containers by offering the easiest-to-use, most
technologically advanced reusable takeout container service in the United
States. 

What is a “reusable
takeout container service,” you ask? Well, after you sign up for BizeeBox for free,
it basically works like this:



You ask for a BizeeBox container when you order takeout food or take leftovers home from a restaurant


You check
out the container (just like you would a library book) using our
super-cool smartphone application


You enjoy your food when and where you want,
then return the container to one of
BizeeBox’s convenient drop-off locations


BizeeBox collects used containers from the
drop-off locations, checks them in for you, cleans and sanitizes so they are good as new, and redistributes clean containers to
restaurants to start the cycle again!









The only
differences between our model and the disposable takeout container model are
that you have to check out and return the containers. Our technology will make
the check out process simple. And returning containers will become easier and
easier as we sign up restaurants and add return locations. Our grand vision is
that eventually you’ll be able to return our containers on every city street
corner and every restaurant, grocery store, office building, airport, mall, and
other food service establishment in the country. Imagine getting takeout at the
airport, bringing it on the plane, and returning it to the flight attendant! 

BizeeBox
uses sturdy, dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe, and BPA-free plastic containers. That means they are also great for storing and
reheating leftovers. You can also use them to bring lunch to work or school,
just like any regular lunchbox. You can even check out as many containers as you like.


All we ask
is that you return each container to us in good condition within 30 days of
checking it out. After that, we have to charge you a replacement fee because,
well, these awesome containers are expensive and we can’t just give them away
for free!
Why is takeout container waste such a
big issue?

All takeout containers require materials, energy, and
water to manufacture and are usually transported a long distance before they end up at a restaurant. And then, after being used only once, most end up in landfills or, even worse, polluting local ecosystems and clogging waterways. This is even true for recyclable, compostable, and biodegradable containers (see our FAQ below or check out our blog for more on this). Meanwhile, taxpayers bear the economic burdens of waste management, litter cleanup, and repairing damaged ecosystems.
So not only are there environmental benefits to reducing the use of disposable takeout containers, but the more containers we keep out of the waste stream and our environment,
the more tax dollars will be freed up for other purposes. Even better, we’ll
create a few local jobs because we’ll need people to collect, clean, and
redistribute takeout containers.

How big of a difference can we make?

We are starting
BizeeBox in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a college town with approximately 300
restaurants serving a population of 115,000. By our estimates, Ann Arbor restaurants
serve at least 2 million disposable takeout containers per year. 
Since each takeout
container we offer can be reused over 350 times before it needs to be recycled,
BizeeBox can meet Ann Arbor’s needs with less than 1% of the containers. That’s
10,000 BizeeBox containers rather than 2 million disposable containers! To put
this in perspective …


By weight:
This is the same as keeping more than 100 tons out of the waste stream per year. 

By volume:
If you don’t crush them, that many containers would fill approximately 700
average dump trucks.


By
height: If you stacked 2 million standard clamshell containers one on top
of the other, you’d have a tower nearly 100 miles tall. 




And that’s just Ann
Arbor! Nationally
it works out to something like 18
million reusable containers instead of 5
billion disposable containers. It’s an understatement to say that’s a lot
of containers we could keep out of the waste stream and our environment. Doesn’t
this sound like a win, win, win scenario? 

Who are we, and why are we doing
this?

We are Rich
Grousset (bald) and Phel Meyer (bearded), and we are BizeeBox. We met in graduate school and immediately
bonded over our shared distaste for waste (i.e. we don’t like trash). 
We also had
a few other things in common, including our passions for food and ordering
takeout from local restaurants. The more we talked, though, the more we became frustrated
by the number of takeout containers we were throwing away after only one use. So
we started asking ourselves: does this make sense? Is it really necessary?  

That’s
how we started thinking about and researching takeout container waste. We
learned that hundreds of U.S. colleges have begun addressing the issue by implementing
reusable takeout container programs, and there are even a few small businesses out
there doing it as well. But we also found that nobody was addressing the issue
on a large scale. We saw an opportunity to step in and make a difference.
To be
certain this all wasn’t just a fluke, we launched the University of Michigan’s
very first reusable takeout container program. What happened? It was a huge
success, and after just a few weeks, about half of the restaurant’s to-go diners
were using our containers every day! What’s more, we got a ton of positive
feedback from faculty, staff, and students.




We were thrilled
to discover that we’re not the only ones tired of creating unnecessary waste
and that people are willing to embrace reuse if given the opportunity. But now
someone needs to take the initiative to develop a financially viable reusable takeout container service that
can expand to every city in the country. We want to be that someone and could not
be more excited by the opportunity to launch a business that aligns perfectly with
our values. Help us be that someone … Help us take the waste out of takeout!
What do we need?

We are
seeking $30,000, which will allow us to launch a small-scale operation in Ann
Arbor. To do that, we need: 


Containers (~$7,000): We need to purchase 1500 containers,
which is enough to get us started at the first few restaurants.

Collection Boxes (~$3,000): We need to buy
and brand our very own bins people can use to return the containers. We’ll buy 6, put
one in or near each participating restaurant, and add a few additional
ones in prime locations around town.

Operations (~$5,000): This will help us pay for transportation
and dishwashing costs for at least the first few months.

Technology (~$15,000): This will help us begin
developing our smartphone application and web site, which are pivotal to our
success!



After we learn from our experience in Ann Arbor,
we will expand to every other city where reuse makes sense. Will your city be
next?
How can you be part of the movement

you can’t contribute financially, there’s still plenty you can do to become
part of an awesome community of like-minded individuals trying to make the
world a better place. Thank you in advance!

What You Get

Check out the
contribution levels and perk on the top right side of this page. We purposely chose
perks that are light on “stuff” – we don’t want our campaign to generate the
type of waste that we’re trying to reduce! Instead, our perks are about you
joining an amazing community of individuals interested in making a difference. So
get your BizeeBox reusable bag or t-shirt and get out there and be an ambassador
of reuse!
We do want
to highlight the perk that we’re most excited about:Adopt-a-Box! It works like this: Once our service is up and
running, we’ll send you an invitation to “adopt” a BizeeBox. Once you accept, you’ll
be able to login to our web site and see how often the container has been used,
where it has been used, and, most importantly, track just how much of an impact
your investment is having! Please note,
though, that our ability to fulfill this perk depends on our ability to develop
all of the necessary technology, which is why the fulfillment date is not right
away. But we will keep you updated!

Frequently Asked Questions

Wait, is this clean and
safe? I don’t like the idea of using someone else’s container.
Yes!
BizeeBox containers are just as clean as anything else you’re going to eat off
of. In fact, we’d venture to say that we’d rather eat off something we cleaned locally
than something that was manufactured, boxed up, shipped thousands of miles, and
stored in a warehouse!
The cleaning
and sanitizing standards we use are the same as those required of restaurants. We
clean Bizeebox containers using commercial dishwashing equipment in a regularly
inspected facility. After cleaning, the containers are examined by a trained Bizeebox
staff member. If you are interested in learning more about the regulations
governing these procedures, you can read the U.S. Food & Drug
Administration’s cleaning and sanitizing standards in Chapter 4 of its Food Code. 
Wouldn’t it be simpler
if I just brought my own clean container to the restaurant and asked them to
serve my food in it? 
The simple
answer is, yes! And some enthusiastic waste reducers try to do just that. Unfortunately,
there are two important issues with this. First,
the FDA’s Food Code (see 4-603.17: “Returnables, Cleaning for Refilling”) prohibits restaurants from serving
food in a container brought in to the establishment by a customer (beverage
containers, like coffee mugs, are exempt from this rule). This is to protect us
all in case a customer does not completely sanitize their container and it somehow
ends up contaminating food served to others. You are allowed, however, to take
leftovers from your plate and put them in a container you brought in. But we
don’t think asking people to do this is a systematic solution to the problem. 
That leads
to the second key issue: behavior change.
Even if people could bring their own containers, how many people would? They
would have to always clean the container themselves and either (a) carry it
around all the time until they needed it, or (b) always remember to bring it
along on the specific days they think they will use it. We believe our system
is easier: you bring back your used (dirty) containers to return receptacles
when it makes sense for you, and you are free to pick up a new container
whenever you want. You do not need to bring in the old one at the same time as you pick up a new
one!
What if people don’t
return their BizeeBox containers?
Only diners
who are signed up for the program are allowed to take food to-go in a BizeeBox
container. We don’t require a deposit up front, but we will charge diners for any
containers they don’t return within thirty (30) days. In this way, we ensure
that (a) we aren’t giving out expensive containers for free, and (b) people are
incentivized to bring their containers back!
What about recyclable,
compostable, or biodegradable containers? Aren’t those enough?
That’s a very important question! First,
every time a reusable takeout container is used, that’s one less single-use
container manufactured for just one meal. Each of those disposables needs to be
manufactured, shipped a long way, and cared for at its end-of-life, leading to
significant environmental impacts. Second, given today’s infrastructure and
consumer behavior, most disposable containers still end up in the landfill,
regardless of whether or not they could be recycled or composted. And finally,
reusable takeout containers enable more economic activity to happen locally. We
pay people to collect, clean, and redistribute the containers locally rather
than paying manufacturers and distributors to make and ship containers a long
distance.
The best available research says that
if reusable takeout containers are in fact reused hundreds of times, which our
system is set up to ensure, then they are environmentally preferable to
recyclable, compostable, and biodegradable containers. Be sure to check out our
blog posts on the benefits of reuse and don’t hesitate to contact us if you want more
information!
What are the containers
made of? Are they BPA-free?

The
containers BizeeBox currently uses are made from #5 polypropylene (PP) plastic,
are BPA-free and are NSF certified. They are manufactured in China and
sold in the U.S. by G.E.T. Enterprises, a restaurant supplier based in Houston, Texas. We did not design these containers, nor do we manufacture them; what we do is make these containers available to as many people as possible. 
Like most
plastic, PP is made from petroleum, which is not a renewable resource (we know … this pains us to think about
too!). The good news is that, as we mentioned above, reusable plastic
containers are still preferable to anything else on the market when you look at the entire lifecycle of the product.
How will BizeeBox make
money after you run out of Indiegogo money? Or is this a non-profit?
BizeeBox is
a for-profit venture. We will make money by charging restaurants a
per-container usage fee just like they currently pay for disposable takeout
containers, selling advertising, and offering marketing services based on the
data we gather. We have a business plan based on several years’ of research,
but most investors want proof of concept for a new idea like this with an
uncertain demand. So we’re out to prove not only that people are ready to
embrace reusable takeout containers, but that our service can be profitable.
Our plan is to test all of the research-based estimates and assumptions in our
business plan so that we can then make the case to investors, restaurants, and
cities that our model makes sense everywhere.
Wait, but won’t the
collection bins get smelly and attract vermin?
Our
experience launching a reusable takeout container program while in school
showed that as long as the return receptacles are emptied on a daily basis,
there are no problems. Our bins will be sturdy and hard to break into, and we
will empty them daily (or more often, if necessary) while also cleaning them on
a regular basis. We are therefore confident that they will stay clean, shiny,
and safe 365 days a year!
Do containers get
stained or fall apart if they’re used too many times?
The
containers we buy have been tested in hundreds of places by thousands of
customers and typically last for more than 350 uses. In fact, in our experience,
the containers have a breakage rate of less than 1%. Even better, they don’t
stain, even if you fill them with BBQ sauce or Chicken Tikka Masala. As long as
they go through a commercial dishwasher (which they will), then there are no
problems!
And you
don’t have to worry that you’re getting an old, beat-up container, because
we’re tracking each one and will make sure that they are recycled once they
reach the end of their “life.” 

Can I put BizeeBox
containers in my own dishwasher or microwave?
Yes, you sure
can! You can use them to heat up leftovers in the microwave and clean them in
your dishwasher. Keep in mind, though, that since these are plastic containers,
you cannot place them on stovetops, in ovens, or on any other similarly hot
surfaces because the containers will melt and/or be damaged.
Where will I be able to
pick up food in a BizeeBox container once I sign up for the program?
You will be
able to take food to-go in a BizeeBox container at any participating
restaurant. We will try our best to get as many restaurants on board as
possible, as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you’re sick of your
containers ending up in the landfill, let your favorite restaurant owner know
that you want them to start using BizeeBox!

<p><strong>“Let’s preserve the Azores Bullfinch”</strong> is a campaign to rise funds to keep this species from extinction, ensuring the continuation of the conservation work undertaken since 2002 while contributing for the preservation of the native laurel forest and promoting local employment and economies.</p>
<p>The Azores bullfinch – the priolo (<em>Pyrrhula murina</em>) – is an endangered species endemic to the eastern mountains of the island of São Miguel in the Azores (Portugal). Considered almost extinct in the 20th century, today there is a small population of just over 1,000 priolos in total. Its habitat is highly threatened by the invasion of alien plant species. Projects implemented in the last few years by the Portuguese Society for the Study of Birds (SPEA – a non-profit association that promotes the study and conservation of birds in Portugal) and partners successfully restored an important area of the Azorean laurel forest, the habitat of the priolo, removing invasive alien plants and planting thousands of native and endemic species.</p>
<p>              <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/559072/pictures/full/20121129034937-priolos_pedro_monteiro.jpg?1354189782"" src="""" style="""" title=""Azores Bullfinch""/></p>
<p>These projects helped improving the status of the priolo’s population which increased from around 300 birds in the 1990’s to around 1,000 at the present. But the population remains very small. Although the priolo has been downgraded from “critically endangered” to “endangered” on the IUCN Red List, it continues to be one of the most threatened and rarest birds in Europe.</p>
<p>Maintenance of the areas already cleared of invasive alien plant species is crucial for saving both the priolo, and the native laurel forest of São Miguel island, so important to the survival of the bird and to the local populations.</p>
<p>Your contribution is essential to keep this project going. With your support we can continue to preserve the priolo and its natural habitat by managing the restored areas, as well as propagating the native and endemic species of the Azores and planting them in mountain areas cleared of invasive species.</p>
<p>In 2009 the LIFE Sustainable Laurel was started on a bigger scale with additional funding provided by many valued supporters including the BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Programme, Species Champion Birdwatch Magazine and the British Birdwatching Fair.  The project focused on the preservation of two critical habitats of São Miguel Island: Azores laurel forest and the Azorean peat bogs. Overall, we have already recovered about 350 hectares of natural habitats in the eastern mountains of São Miguel Island; this was only possible with the hard work of an experienced and qualified team, this has created over 20 jobs/year in nature conservation in the two most rural and remote councils of the island.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Have Done - Conservation Work</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2002, SPEA started working in the Azores together with the Azorean government, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, local municipalities, and the University of the Azores, through LIFE funding from the European Commission. This project (LIFE Priolo) started the restoration of the main areas of native laurel forest where the priolo lives by cutting out invasive alien plant species and planting the threatened native and endemic plants such as the Azorean juniper, Azorean blueberry, laurel and Azorean holly, and engaging local communities in the conservation of their natural heritage. The project, which was awarded the Best of the Best LIFE project by the European Commission, was a landmark in the 2010 International Year of Biodiversity as one of the few examples of a species that recovered the population numbers and escaped from the immediate effect of extinction.</p>

<p>In 2009 a new project was started on a bigger scale. The LIFE+ Sustainable Laurel focused on the preservation of two critical habitats of São Miguel island: Azores laurel forest and the Azorean peat bogs. Overall, we have already recovered about 350 hectares of natural habitats in the eastern mountains of São Miguel island; this was only possible with the hard work of an experienced and qualified team, this has created over 20 jobs/year in nature conservation in the two most rural and remote councils of the island.</p>
<p>These projects also have a significant social and economical impact, creating qualified jobs and promoting a more sustainable development of the local economies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this project will end on December 2012 and so far not enough funding has been secured to continue, jeopardizing all past achievements. It is essential not to allow invasive alien species to re-conquer the priolo’s territory; we need to continue to manage the restored areas, produce native plants in a nursery and plant them in the priolo’s territory.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Must do &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We ned to maintain the laurel forest in good condition to allow the priolo to survive. The bird is not only a national treasure and endemic, it is also a part of the Azorean and the world’s biodiversity. We need to monitor the areas and the bird so that we can prevent new invasions by alien plants in the main natural areas. To maintain the forest, it is essential to control new invasions and propagate approximately 30,000 plants per year and plant them to increase food availability for the priolo. At least $60,000 are required to maintain the more urgent work. We need your help to raise a significant part of these funds.</p>
<p>You can make a real difference by helping to preserve the habitat of this unique bird. SPEA urges you all to contribute. Any donation will help us to restore more habitat – produce more plants - save more priolos, while ensuring social and economic benefits promoting local development and sustainable tourism.</p>
<p>Be part of our project and help us to save the priolo while enjoying some benefits this will bring you. Come to see the plants we produce; see how the native forest thrives after the removal of invaders and produce more food and shelter for the priolo. And try to see the bird.</p>
<p>The priolo is counting on your support!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If the project stops now, all our efforts over the last decade might be in jeopardy and we, the Azorean native forest, and the priolo, might lose the war against alien invasive plants. This would probably imply the extinction of the priolo in the near future.</p>

<p>Peru is characterized by extreme VULNERABILITY to climate change and unique cultural and biological diversity,
all within a context of deep social FRAGMENTATION. In order to create and
advance solutions that respond to both the climate crisis and the fragmented reality of the country, we believe that it is essential to generate a space for
YOUTH FROM DIVERSE REGIONS AND CONTEXTS TO MEET, WORK, AND PLAN TOGETHER as part of an INCLUSIVE movement.</p>
<p>A national
gathering—TierrActiva (Sept. 11-14, 2014)—which links to a series of similar youth “Power Shift”
meetings worldwide, has the potential to catalyze and further articulate a radical
youth climate movement in Peru that can both be a critical presence at upcoming
UN climate change negotiations in December (COP 20), and push forward meaningful
national climate policies. Getting to know each other in person
can also foster A MORE TANGIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE national youth movement, one
with the capacity to make visible the connections between climate change, inequality,
indigenous rights and social justice in Peru.</p>
<p>We hope to create a space that not
only strengthens the bonds between local initiatives and events in Peru, but
also to the international movements present at spaces such as COY 10
and the People´s Summit/Cumbre de los Pueblos. </p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>We are asking for $2500 to go
towards PARTICIPANTS' COSTS OF TRAVEL, as well as SEED FUNDING for subsequent
local initiatives by participants. We are already asking that participants
contribute to their own travel costs as much as possible, and have secured $14,700
from the Global Greengrant Fund for lodging,
meals, venue, and travel within Lima for 92 participants and facilitators over 4
days. <br/></p><p>The additional $2500 travel funding we are seeking through this campaign
is crucial because participants coming from more remote regions (and thus with higher transportation expenses) like the Amazon
are usually the most marginalized, often because of their geographical distance
from Lima. We need the additional funds in order to make TierrActiva a truly
inclusive and diverse gathering.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will be helping to strengthen the youth climate
movement in Peru, particularly in terms of the inclusion of minority youth voices. Beyond Peru, TierrActiva is contributing to a
global movement of youth fighting for climate justice, and is a follow on event
from Global Power Shift gathering held in Istanbul in 2013. </p>
<p>The impact of your contributions will be felt when the UN climate
negotiations annual Conference of the Parties (COP) comes to Peru in December.
TierrActiva will contribute towards ensuring that international groups coming to Lima are met and hosted by a strong
and strategic Peruvian youth climate movement which, in addition to understanding
and contributing to the content and process of the negotiations, are able to
articulate to a global audience their concerns, solutions and strategies. </p>
<p>TierrActiva also aims to develop participants’ knowledge of the content, implications and importance of a
National Strategy and Regional Climate Change Strategies within Peru, which
currently lacks up-to-date and enforceable climate legislation. One of the
impacts of your donation will be a youth movement that is committed to
achieving the approval and meaningful implementation of such national climate
change legislation. </p>
<p>Finally, your contribution will make it possible
for us to administer a seed grant fund, enabling TierrActiva participants to implement
local actions and campaigns aimed at raising awareness in their towns, training
local activists, advocating for district-based environmental issues and
lobbying at a municipal level, among others. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We are facing some challenges to realizing the vision of TierrActiva, such as the logistical challenge of bringing
participants from all of Peru to the capital Lima. Fortunately this challenge
is predominantly financial, and we hope to overcome it with your support. Other challenges include
following through with modular actions at the local level after the gathering
in Lima, which we aim to address by drawing from our experience as
youth organizers and dedicating time to focus on campaign planning and
accountability during the gathering, and by maintaining communication efforts
with participants afterwards. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

contribute financially to TierrActiva, you can still help us by:</p>

Peru is characterized by extreme VULNERABILITY to climate change and unique cultural and biological diversity,
all within a context of deep social FRAGMENTATION. In order to create and
advance solutions that respond to both the climate crisis and the fragmented reality of the country, we believe that it is essential to generate a space for
YOUTH FROM DIVERSE REGIONS AND CONTEXTS TO MEET, WORK, AND PLAN TOGETHER as part of an INCLUSIVE movement.
A national
gathering—TierrActiva (Sept. 11-14, 2014)—which links to a series of similar youth “Power Shift”
meetings worldwide, has the potential to catalyze and further articulate a radical
youth climate movement in Peru that can both be a critical presence at upcoming
UN climate change negotiations in December (COP 20), and push forward meaningful
national climate policies. Getting to know each other in person
can also foster A MORE TANGIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE national youth movement, one
with the capacity to make visible the connections between climate change, inequality,
indigenous rights and social justice in Peru.
We hope to create a space that not
only strengthens the bonds between local initiatives and events in Peru, but
also to the international movements present at spaces such as COY 10
and the People´s Summit/Cumbre de los Pueblos. 
What We Need 
We are asking for $2500 to go
towards PARTICIPANTS' COSTS OF TRAVEL, as well as SEED FUNDING for subsequent
local initiatives by participants. We are already asking that participants
contribute to their own travel costs as much as possible, and have secured $14,700
from the Global Greengrant Fund for lodging,
meals, venue, and travel within Lima for 92 participants and facilitators over 4
days. The additional $2500 travel funding we are seeking through this campaign
is crucial because participants coming from more remote regions (and thus with higher transportation expenses) like the Amazon
are usually the most marginalized, often because of their geographical distance
from Lima. We need the additional funds in order to make TierrActiva a truly
inclusive and diverse gathering.
The Impact
By contributing to this campaign you will be helping to strengthen the youth climate
movement in Peru, particularly in terms of the inclusion of minority youth voices. Beyond Peru, TierrActiva is contributing to a
global movement of youth fighting for climate justice, and is a follow on event
from Global Power Shift gathering held in Istanbul in 2013. 
The impact of your contributions will be felt when the UN climate
negotiations annual Conference of the Parties (COP) comes to Peru in December.
TierrActiva will contribute towards ensuring that international groups coming to Lima are met and hosted by a strong
and strategic Peruvian youth climate movement which, in addition to understanding
and contributing to the content and process of the negotiations, are able to
articulate to a global audience their concerns, solutions and strategies. 
TierrActiva also aims to develop participants’ knowledge of the content, implications and importance of a
National Strategy and Regional Climate Change Strategies within Peru, which
currently lacks up-to-date and enforceable climate legislation. One of the
impacts of your donation will be a youth movement that is committed to
achieving the approval and meaningful implementation of such national climate
change legislation. 
Finally, your contribution will make it possible
for us to administer a seed grant fund, enabling TierrActiva participants to implement
local actions and campaigns aimed at raising awareness in their towns, training
local activists, advocating for district-based environmental issues and
lobbying at a municipal level, among others. 
Risks & Challenges
We are facing some challenges to realizing the vision of TierrActiva, such as the logistical challenge of bringing
participants from all of Peru to the capital Lima. Fortunately this challenge
is predominantly financial, and we hope to overcome it with your support. Other challenges include
following through with modular actions at the local level after the gathering
in Lima, which we aim to address by drawing from our experience as
youth organizers and dedicating time to focus on campaign planning and
accountability during the gathering, and by maintaining communication efforts
with participants afterwards. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you personally can’t
contribute financially to TierrActiva, you can still help us by:

Sharing
     our Indiegogo campaign far and wide!

Sending
     us helpful resources such as campaign toolkits, social media guides,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Global Plastics Recovery.  Over the past few years we have developed and perfected a process to remove the paint from scrapped painted plastic.  We have proven the process works by removing the paint from over 40,000 pounds of painted plastic, while going through rigorous testing to prove the base material does not degrade.  Our current system has taken us this far, to continue forward we need to re-engineer the current system to a more streamlined, compact, efficent system.  We are not altering the process, just the way we move the plastic through the system.  GPRI is the only company in the world that does not degrade the plastic when we remove the paint.  This is new technology that has the potential to greatly impact the way scrap painted plastic is reused.  We say reused, because by not changing the plastic we don't have to recycle it to something else.  Our customers will see an immediate cost saving over the price of new resins, and the environment will see the impact of no longer putting scrap painted plastic into landfills</p>
<p>We have come to Indiegogo, because traditional funding models have failed us.  A bank will not give us a loan without a Purchase Order from a Customer.  A Customer will not give GPRI a Purchase Order without a fully functional system.  Our funding needs don't fit the guidelines of Venture Capital Funds, therefore we have come to you.  We hope you see the benifits we can provide, to both the environment and the community, and contribute to GPRI's campain.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>GPRI has set a goal to raise 1.3 Million USD in 30 days.  The money will be used to transform an outdated, ineffecient system with a new and improved system with reduced size, that is still capable of removing the paint from 4 million pounds of scrap painted plastic.</p>
<p>The steps we take after reaching our goal will be to work with an engineering group to redesign, change, and correct the way plastic is moved through the system.  We will then implement the changes, and test the equipment to work out any bugs.  GPRI upon proving the new system works efficiently, will start cleaning scrap painted plastic.</p>
<p>When all goes as planned, in six months GPRI will be able to offer our customers an alternitive to sending their scrap plastic to landfills, and be able to reuse it, at a reduced cost compared to the expensive virgin resins.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Global Platics Recovery feels it impact will be felt in a few ways:</p>
<p>The Environment.  GPRI will have the ability to clean 4 million pounds of scrap plastic annually, per machine.  That means 4 million pounds of scrap plastic will not end up in landfills;  Four million pounds of new resin that doen't have to be manufactured; and a savings of over 26,000 barrels of oil that doen't have to be refined to manufacture new plastic.  The savings will be multiplied with every new system we create.</p>
<p>The Community.  GPRI sees a market far greater than 4 million pounds of scrap painted plastic, therefore, we see a need to build and maintain multiple systems.  GPRI will have to purchase standard components, order the raw materials to manufacture and fabricate, and employ the people necessary to complete the tasks at hand.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>GRPI understands that not eveyone who sees our presentaion can contribute monitarily, but you can still help us by spreading the word.  It's a 30 day campain to raise the funds.  If you like the project tell others about GPRI, and join us in becoming a success story.</p>

</div></div>","Turtle Sense is local program with worldwide implications. It is a great example of how the Hatteras Island Ocean Center is fulfilling its mission of revitalizing Hatteras Island economically in a way that is sustainable without changing the basic character of the area, thereby making Hatteras Island (part of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, and home to Cape Hatteras National Seashore) a better place to live and visit, by facilitating improved use of the Island's natural resources.
Turtle Sense technology is open source and all hardware designs and software source code will be available at no cost. All Turtle Sense data will be available to researchers everywhere. We believe that eventually Turtle Sense technology will be deployed globally, helping sea turtles and people coexist together better everywhere. For general information about Turtle Sense visit www.turtlesense.org. For more detailed technical information visit http://hackaday.io/project/2264-Turtle-Sense.

Please support Turtle Sense and the Hatteras Island Ocean Center and play a part in saving endangered sea turtles.Why is Turtle Sense needed?
The current system used to manage sea turtle nests can lead to beach closures that sometimes last longer than a month. These closures can impact both people walking and vehicles driving.

What are the expected benefits?

Shorter beach closures.
Better protection of turtle hatchlings.
Improved opportunities for visitors see a nest “boil” and watch hatchlings crawl into the ocean.
Lower cost of nest management.

How does it work?
Small sensors that measure temperature and motion are placed inside the nest, on top of the eggs. Using mobile phone technology, sensor data is sent on a regular basis, via the Internet, for analysis. We hope that we will soon understand how to use the data to accurately predict when hatchlings will emerge from the nest.

Who is doing the project?
Turtle Sense is a joint effort of the Ocean Center, Nerds Without Borders, and the National Park Service. 

How is Turtle Sense funded?All of the software and hardware development engineering has been donated by Nerds Without Borders. Seed money for production of equipment has been provided by an IBM On Demand Community grant and the U.S. National Park Service. The Hatteras Island Ocean Center conceived Turtle Sense and is providing support services.


Half of the money raised from this campaign will be used to help fund Turtle Sense and half will help support Ocean Center Ecology Park and the Ocean Center's ecology education programs.



Choose a Perk
Your support will help people and sea turtles, and you'll be part of making Hatteras Island a better place to live and visit. If you plan on visiting Hatteras, North Carolina choose a perk that will allow you to experience Hatteras Island's ecology and gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for the Islands's dynamic ecosystem. If you can't visit, your support is still important and you'll be helping to ensure that Turtle Sense technology becomes available worldwide and that the Ocean Center can continue its mission.

Thank you and please help get the word out about this campaign.


Our giant, guitar-playing, dancing turtle is looking forward to creating a custom thank-you message for you.



Do you want to explore the area by kayak or SUP when you take your nature tour?




Steve is looking forward to giving you and four of your friends a great aerial tour of Hatteras Island and the surrounding area.

<p><strong>What Roads?</strong></p>
<p>The whole world is now talking about global climate, emissions while trying to find a way to find a more environmentally friendly way of transportation. The re-construction can only happen once and this is the point in history where we’re about to make that change.</p>
<p>We want to tell the story about the future of roads.  They are fundamental to our lives.  They have been a part of our societies since the beginning of time.  In our current age they have dominated the news and our lives.  Through the commute to work to how we live our lives when faced with the prospect of climate change.  They define our potential and our weaknesses – the car has become a status symbol of the modern world.   Yet the humble road that they travel on is undergoing massive changes.  How we live our lives are affecting roads.  Politicians are planning out how our roads and cities will look.   The roads that will be the veins and arteries of the metropolises of the future.  But are those assumptions they make correct? Are they making the right decisions?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How?</strong></p>
<p>We are going to examine that future. Working with Salmonick Productions we want to show the world what the future may look like and how it will affect us.  Animation will allow us to show to the viewer how the concepts would look like in practice and allows us to examine the real situations.</p>
<p>Salmonick are brilliant animators from the Netherlands, who will help us to illustrate and demonstrate our future.   The concepts we will explore while they may sound familiar - will with animation be bought to life.</p>
<p>We’ve researched this subject and now we want to bring our research to the screen.</p>
<p>With interviews from scientists, engineers, politicians and academics we will examine the issues that will affect travel by road and the roads themselves.   We aim to show how the future’s uncertainty is leading us in many potential directions.  With critical analysis we want to show how the world may end up looking.</p>
<p>Throughout human history roads have evolved alongside us.  From the advent of the wheel to Roman roads, the horse and buggy and the internal combustion engine the challenges facing keeping humanity moving have evolved as our technology and societies have.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>This is not the most obvious subject for a documentary it’s true.   But it’s a fascinating one.  With car ownership on the rise globally and travel and it’s “problems” dominating more and more of our lives it has become even more apparent that what the future holds will define us.</p>

<h3><strong>Hi Everyone! My name is Karen Miles. I am fortunate enough to have been invited to join a dog sled expedition in Northern Labrador/Nunatsiavut. I am going to photograph and film this journey to help to document a vanishing way of life. Climate change affecting sea ice conditions and snowmobiles having all but replaced dogs have significantly impacted the traditional way of life for the Inuit. My work has taken me to the most wonderful places including Nunatsiavut and Labrador where I've had the opportunity to meet amazing and resilient people. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Three years ago Omma and his family gave me a beautiful husky pup and this experience has changed my life. I've always wanted to give back the same kindness and care. Some young people desire to practice and respect the old ways. One of them is Ommati. Those of you who have sailed with us in Labrador and visited Hebron know him as Julius Merkuratsuk. I have known Omma for 8 years as my husband and I visit his home in Nain, Labrador on our travels aboard our vessel Wanderbird (<a href=""http://www.wanderbirdcruises.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wanderbirdcruises.com</a>). </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Omma wants to live more in the old way, he loves dogs and knows how to run a team. So I am asking you kind friends for some asistance to help Omma join me on this amazing dogsled journey. We will travel over 1,000 km round trip.  This request is NOT for myself but for Omma. We need to purchase air tickets for him to meet with us in Goose Bay Labrador and for misc expenses like lodging for him before and after the trip. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Our wish is to help a young Inuk discover an important part of his culture. We will continue to encourage him to one day have his own dog team. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>It is Omma's dream to be able to offer (in the form of tourism) the experience of living off the land and traveling by dog team in Nunatsiavut. Please help us so that we can make this happen for 16 year old Ommati Merkuratsuk.</strong></h3>

We would also like to bring some other young people on this expedition to help them to learn the skills of their ancestors.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">This April 27-29, <a href=""http://ny.wearepowershift.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Power Shift NY</a> will be a mass gathering of young New Yorkers together in Albany for a weekend-long summit that will awaken and empower our generation to put an end to our addiction to fossil fuels by standing up for a green economy.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>As climate change intensifies, New York State officials are making plans to allow dangerous hydraulic fracturing across a wide area of our state, putting the water, health and the climate of millions of New Yorkers at risk, all for for the dirty profits of Big Oil and Big Gas. <strong>Power Shift NY will bring together over 300 young people from all corners of New York State to unite in Albany</strong> for a weekend-long convergence that will train our generation <strong>to take bold action for a just and sustainable future. </strong></span></p>
<h2>OUR MOMENT</h2>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">
<a href=""http://ny.wearepowershift.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Power Shift NY</a> will mark a turning point as young people of all backgrounds unite to take a stand and demand a just and sustainable future.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>With</span><span> powerful training and a bold vision</span><span>, <strong>the collective power of young people will allow for game-changing action to create a livable future for all New Yorkers</strong>. Power Shift NY will give us the opportunity to harness our collective power and build a green economy from the grassroots up. Young people are disproportionately affected by the decisions made by those currently in power, but we’re not standing idly by. In 2016, our generation will be the largest voting block by age in U.S. history.  That's why we’re getting organized, we’re voting and we’re taking action in our communities. <strong>Power Shift New York will be a catalyzing force in the creation of a sustainable future for our state</strong>.</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">OUR CHALLENGE</h2>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">From February through April, youth from North Country to New York City will collaborate and partner up with different groups throughout the state to recruit, organize and train a generation of activists through <a href=""http://ny.wearepowershift.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Power Shift NY</a>.</h3>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We have a big task. Power Shift NY is going to bring young people together of all backgrounds for one huge weekend of social change.</span>We are creating a network of high schools, colleges, universities, and non-student youth throughout the state that will work to preserve our future<strong>. We’re going to get our hands dirty building campaigns from the grassroots up that will organize our campuses, our communities and New York State for an unprecedented surge of youth action. </strong><span>Our task is no less than building an equitable, sustainable future, where a healthy environment is the cornerstone of sustainable economics and healthy communities.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Will you donate $10, $25, $50, or $100 to support young leaders to stop fracking and to build a green economy?</span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">WHY DONATE?</h2>
<h3 dir=""ltr""><span>We’ve had great success so far.</span></h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">At Power Shift 2011, New York came back from DC with one of the strongest youth networks in the country, the<strong> <a href=""http://nygreenumbrella.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Green Umbrella</a></strong>: NY Youth for a Just and Sustainable Future. <strong>Since April 2011, hundreds of young New Yorkers have taken action against Big Oil and Gas. </strong>In August, over 50 New York youth joined the historic Tar Sands Action sit-in in Washington D.C. In November, hundreds traveled to D.C. to hold President Obama to his campaign promise- ""to end the tyranny of oil<strong>""</strong>- and we blocked the Keystone XL pipeline. When the fight turned to fracking in the Delaware River Basin, we teamed up with Josh Fox, Food &amp; Water Watch, 350.org and frontline activists from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware to protect 15 million people's water and score a huge win in the movement to ban fracking. <strong>Since Power Shift 2011, we've been winning, but we have big challenges ahead.  </strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Youth have been a driving force in creating social change</span><span> throughout history, from the civil rights movement, to the struggle to end apartheid, and now the international movement to achieve climate neutrality. As young New Yorkers from all walks of life, we envision a just and equitable society, powered by </span><span>100 % clean energy</span><span>, and we are ready to take bold action to make this vision a reality. <strong>History is calling our generation to act, and </strong></span><strong>we’re ready to answer.</strong></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">We in the <a href=""http://nygreenumbrella.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Green Umbrella</a> are doing this work on a volunteer basis and many of us have already devoted not only hours, but personal resources to get the ball rolling. However, we can’t do it alone.  </h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Through our grassroots fundraising campaign, we aim to raise a <em><strong>total of $3,000 to pay for the conference space</strong></em> rental at the Hotel Albany. In addition, our registration fees will be used to pay for the training and program materials, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing training packets</li>
<li>Use of AV equipment</li>
<li>Supplies for break-out groups</li>
</ul><p>We want you to be 100% confident that your donation will result in tangible social change. To ensure this, our team will send you updates on our progress via email.  </p>

This April 27-29, Power Shift NY will be a mass gathering of young New Yorkers together in Albany for a weekend-long summit that will awaken and empower our generation to put an end to our addiction to fossil fuels by standing up for a green economy.
As climate change intensifies, New York State officials are making plans to allow dangerous hydraulic fracturing across a wide area of our state, putting the water, health and the climate of millions of New Yorkers at risk, all for for the dirty profits of Big Oil and Big Gas. Power Shift NY will bring together over 300 young people from all corners of New York State to unite in Albany for a weekend-long convergence that will train our generation to take bold action for a just and sustainable future. 
OUR MOMENT

Power Shift NY will mark a turning point as young people of all backgrounds unite to take a stand and demand a just and sustainable future.
With powerful training and a bold vision, the collective power of young people will allow for game-changing action to create a livable future for all New Yorkers. Power Shift NY will give us the opportunity to harness our collective power and build a green economy from the grassroots up. Young people are disproportionately affected by the decisions made by those currently in power, but we’re not standing idly by. In 2016, our generation will be the largest voting block by age in U.S. history.  That's why we’re getting organized, we’re voting and we’re taking action in our communities. Power Shift New York will be a catalyzing force in the creation of a sustainable future for our state.
OUR CHALLENGE
From February through April, youth from North Country to New York City will collaborate and partner up with different groups throughout the state to recruit, organize and train a generation of activists through Power Shift NY.
We have a big task. Power Shift NY is going to bring young people together of all backgrounds for one huge weekend of social change.We are creating a network of high schools, colleges, universities, and non-student youth throughout the state that will work to preserve our future. We’re going to get our hands dirty building campaigns from the grassroots up that will organize our campuses, our communities and New York State for an unprecedented surge of youth action. Our task is no less than building an equitable, sustainable future, where a healthy environment is the cornerstone of sustainable economics and healthy communities.
Will you donate $10, $25, $50, or $100 to support young leaders to stop fracking and to build a green economy?
WHY DONATE?
We’ve had great success so far.
At Power Shift 2011, New York came back from DC with one of the strongest youth networks in the country, the Green Umbrella: NY Youth for a Just and Sustainable Future. Since April 2011, hundreds of young New Yorkers have taken action against Big Oil and Gas. In August, over 50 New York youth joined the historic Tar Sands Action sit-in in Washington D.C. In November, hundreds traveled to D.C. to hold President Obama to his campaign promise- ""to end the tyranny of oil""- and we blocked the Keystone XL pipeline. When the fight turned to fracking in the Delaware River Basin, we teamed up with Josh Fox, Food & Water Watch, 350.org and frontline activists from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware to protect 15 million people's water and score a huge win in the movement to ban fracking. Since Power Shift 2011, we've been winning, but we have big challenges ahead.  
Youth have been a driving force in creating social change throughout history, from the civil rights movement, to the struggle to end apartheid, and now the international movement to achieve climate neutrality. As young New Yorkers from all walks of life, we envision a just and equitable society, powered by 100 % clean energy, and we are ready to take bold action to make this vision a reality. History is calling our generation to act, and we’re ready to answer.
What We Need & What You Get
We in the Green Umbrella are doing this work on a volunteer basis and many of us have already devoted not only hours, but personal resources to get the ball rolling. However, we can’t do it alone.  
Through our grassroots fundraising campaign, we aim to raise a total of $3,000 to pay for the conference space rental at the Hotel Albany. In addition, our registration fees will be used to pay for the training and program materials, including:

Printing training packets
Use of AV equipment
Supplies for break-out groups
We want you to be 100% confident that your donation will result in tangible social change. To ensure this, our team will send you updates on our progress via email.  
We want to extend our gratitude for your generous support by offering unique perks for donations!  We hope you can join us at Power Shift NY!

Foreword                            
If you want to live, read this book.
“Cannabis vs. Climate Change”introduces ecological interrelationships of pivotal evolutionary consequence.Mankind’s peaceful existence, or our violent global extinction, will be determined by strategies initiated today, to repair Earth’s atmosphere.
Until now, all possible means for reversing global systemic imbalance have not been considered. Nor have all threats to our planet been factored into the equation of survival. The urgency of implementing the most effective measures possible, and due consideration of what is at stake, put all strategies to heal the atmosphere on the table for consideration.
‘Time’ is the only thing we can’t make more of. Every growing season that passes without the benefits of Cannabis agriculture is gone forever. Our species has an indecipherable number of planting seasons left, to resolve compounding imbalances that threaten everyone with systemic collapse of Earth’s environment, global economics and the human social order. 
A polar shift in values, from “illegal” to essential, is the evolutionary leap of collective consciousness required if humankind is to recover symbiotic relationship within a functioning Natural Order. Cannabis farming is Homo sapiens’ resource interface with the operating system of the Earth. 
Cannabis is essential to our existence on this planet. The sooner we appreciate the world’s most valuable crop for what it is truly worth, the sooner we can begin to coordinate the large-scale planting needed; to maximize the chances for survival of  subsequent generations, following us into a very dangerous and unstable future.

Nistri // biologo / fotografo professionista/</p>
<p>// Davide Palumbo //biologo / esperto in eco-turismo/<br/><br/></p>
<p>Mi chiamo Roberto Nistri, sono un biologo e fotografo
naturalista italiano. Ho ""scoperto"" 
il Gambela National Park  durante
un viaggio compiuto in Etiopia nel febbraio del 2011. I nostri fuoristrada
hanno attraversato un territorio vastissimo, sconosciuto anche alle guide che ci accompagnavano. Una terra abitata da popolazioni tribali come i Nuer, agricoltori e
allevatori di bestiame che vivono vicino alle sponde del Baro River e i cui
bambini non avevano mai incontrato un uomo bianco. Un ambiente primordiale e
incontaminato popolato da molti dei grandi mammiferi spariti dal resto del
paese e da un grandissimo numero di uccelli. E che solo più tardi, dopo il mio
ritorno in Italia, ho scoperto essere la seconda più importante area di
migrazione di grandi mammiferi africani. Con decine di migliaia di antilopi endemiche white eared kob (Kobus kob leucotis) che
attraversano ogni anno le sue savane e le sue aree umide. </p>
<p>Oggi solo un turismo
consapevole e rispettoso degli ecosistemi, strettamente collegato con le
popolazioni locali, può generare un flusso di denaro che garantisca la
sopravvivenza di un parco all'interno di una grande nazione dai moltissimi
problemi qual è l'Etiopia. Trasmettere la bellezza e l'importanza di quest'area
è probabilmente lo strumento più efficace e meno costoso per salvaguardarla. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Il
motivo per il quale oggi sto chiedendo il vostro aiuto è che, in tempi brevissimi,
è necessario generare un consistente flusso turistico verso il parco, che porti
all'amministrazione i fondi necessari per la sua gestione, e al governo un
concreto riscontro della straordinaria importanza che riveste, per l'Etiopia,
per l'Africa, per il Pianeta, la sua conservazione. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Quello
che voglio organizzare, insieme a Davide Palumbo, zoologo ed esperto in
eco-turismo, è un RAVE (Rapid Assessment Visual Expedition), una spedizione
fotografica, veloce e a relativo basso costo, che riesca a produrre delle
immagini d’impatto da far circolare sul mercato internazionale. Immagini
destinate a creare in tutto il mondo, attenzione, interesse, amore nei
confronti di questo remoto, affascinante angolo di Africa.</p>
<p>Approssimativamente un milione di antilopi kob dalle orecchie bianche, elefanti 
e altri grandi mammiferi migrano nella regione transfrontaliera tra Gambela e Boma (Sud Sudan), in uno dei più grandi e spettacolari movimenti in massa di animali dell'intera Africa. Un prezioso ecosistema, questo, che necessita 
di urgente protezione. Insieme possiamo avere un ruolo nell'assicurare la 
sopravvivenza di un'autentica meraviglia della natura.</p>
<p>E' una missione molto difficile

<p>My name is
Roberto Nistri and I am a biologist and naturalist Italian photographer. I
""discovered"" the Gambela National Park during a voyage to Ethiopia in
February 2011. Our off-road vehicles crossed a vast territory, unknown even to
our tour guides. An area inhabited by tribal people as the fascinating Nuer,
who are for the most part farmers and cattle ranchers living near the banks of
the Baro River, and whose children had never met a white man. </p>
<p>A primordial and
pristine environment populated by many of the large mammals disappeared from
the rest of the country and a large number of birds. </p>
<p>Only later, after my
return to Italy, I figured it to be the second most important area of migration
of African mammals, with tens of thousands of white eared kob antelopes (Kobus kob leucotis) crossing each year its
savannas and its wetlands. </p>
<p>Today, only a conscious tourism and respectful of
ecosystems’ equilibrium, which are by definition closely connected with the
local populations, can generate a cash flow that ensures the survival of a park
in a great nation like Ethiopia, which has many more urgent problems, unrelated
to the conservation of the wildlife. Capturing and sharing with the world the
beauty and importance of this area is probably the most effective and least
expensive way to protect it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am planning on organizing together with Davide
Palumbo, zoologist ad eco-turism expert and with your help, a RAVE (Rapid
Assessment Visual Expedition), a photographic expedition, fast, and relatively
low cost, which is able to produce images of great impact to circulate
internationally on the market. Images that are intended to create attention,
interest and love towards this remote and fascinating corner of Africa, in the
whole world. </p>
<p><em>An estimated one million 
white-eared kobs, elephants and other large mammals migrate in the transboundary 
region between Gambella and Boma (South Sudan), 
one of Africa’s largest and most spectacular mass movements of animals. This precious ecosystem needs protection, and we, together, can 
play a role in ensuring the survival of this natural wonder.</em><br/></p>
<p>Knowledge is, ones again, the only path to survival.
Not without precedents, we can actually operate to safeguard not only an area
of incredible beauty, but of crucial importance for the future of the great African
wildlife, even from far away countries.</p>
<p> Our mission is very difficult, I know,
but not impossible. With your support we can do it. Thank you.</p>

sopravvivenza.La storia
// Roberto
Nistri // biologo / fotografo professionista/
// Davide Palumbo //biologo / esperto in eco-turismo/
Mi chiamo Roberto Nistri, sono un biologo e fotografo
naturalista italiano. Ho ""scoperto"" 
il Gambela National Park  durante
un viaggio compiuto in Etiopia nel febbraio del 2011. I nostri fuoristrada
hanno attraversato un territorio vastissimo, sconosciuto anche alle guide che ci accompagnavano. Una terra abitata da popolazioni tribali come i Nuer, agricoltori e
allevatori di bestiame che vivono vicino alle sponde del Baro River e i cui
bambini non avevano mai incontrato un uomo bianco. Un ambiente primordiale e
incontaminato popolato da molti dei grandi mammiferi spariti dal resto del
paese e da un grandissimo numero di uccelli. E che solo più tardi, dopo il mio
ritorno in Italia, ho scoperto essere la seconda più importante area di
migrazione di grandi mammiferi africani. Con decine di migliaia di antilopi endemiche white eared kob (Kobus kob leucotis) che
attraversano ogni anno le sue savane e le sue aree umide. 
Oggi solo un turismo
consapevole e rispettoso degli ecosistemi, strettamente collegato con le
popolazioni locali, può generare un flusso di denaro che garantisca la
sopravvivenza di un parco all'interno di una grande nazione dai moltissimi
problemi qual è l'Etiopia. Trasmettere la bellezza e l'importanza di quest'area
è probabilmente lo strumento più efficace e meno costoso per salvaguardarla. 

Il
motivo per il quale oggi sto chiedendo il vostro aiuto è che, in tempi brevissimi,
è necessario generare un consistente flusso turistico verso il parco, che porti
all'amministrazione i fondi necessari per la sua gestione, e al governo un
concreto riscontro della straordinaria importanza che riveste, per l'Etiopia,
per l'Africa, per il Pianeta, la sua conservazione. 

Quello
che voglio organizzare, insieme a Davide Palumbo, zoologo ed esperto in
eco-turismo, è un RAVE (Rapid Assessment Visual Expedition), una spedizione
fotografica, veloce e a relativo basso costo, che riesca a produrre delle
immagini d’impatto da far circolare sul mercato internazionale. Immagini
destinate a creare in tutto il mondo, attenzione, interesse, amore nei
confronti di questo remoto, affascinante angolo di Africa.
Approssimativamente un milione di antilopi kob dalle orecchie bianche, elefanti 
e altri grandi mammiferi migrano nella regione transfrontaliera tra Gambela e Boma (Sud Sudan), in uno dei più grandi e spettacolari movimenti in massa di animali dell'intera Africa. Un prezioso ecosistema, questo, che necessita 
di urgente protezione. Insieme possiamo avere un ruolo nell'assicurare la 
sopravvivenza di un'autentica meraviglia della natura.
E' una missione molto difficile
la nostra, lo so, ma non impossibile. Con il vostro sostegno ce la possiamo
fare. Grazie di cuore.

years developing one of the world’s first telecommunications and Wifi

batteries charged. This caused problems with maintaining contact with business associates and, of course, family.</p>

My name is Thomas Pirzl.
After spending many
years developing one of the world’s first telecommunications and Wifi
company, whilst on my global travels, I always came across the same
problem… the latest technology in electronic devices, but problems keeping the
batteries charged. This caused problems with maintaining contact with business associates and, of course, family.
Over the last years I have contributed to the building of solar farms around Spain, Today I work with Spain's leading thermal energy company, installing over 500 solar thermal energy equipment's each month all over Spain.
