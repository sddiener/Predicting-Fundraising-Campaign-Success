<p><i>""At the beginning of the play <strong>""Return To Home Base""</strong>, a Black soldier, Brain Keith, lies alone in the jungle of Vietnam mortally wounded. As we watch his life slipping away. He recalls the highlights and the low lights of his life. We learn about this young man in an intimate telling of his story,  through the frail incites created from the pain and agony of his memories. We re-live those moments in a way that we as the audience,  begin to form a relationship with the character that allows us to understand and, perhaps, truly care about him and others in war in a way that we never have been able to do before in war. Brain Keith becomes not just a name in our memories, of a young black soldier fallen in Vietnam, or name on a monument or wall, but a living breathing person that the audience grows to know and  once knew as a person who served his country despite its indifferences towards him.""</i></p>

<p><br/>I am writing to ask you to support my latest project, <strong>""RETURN TO HOME BASE"", an acapella musical play written in two acts</strong>, for the Austin Veterans Arts Festival AVAFEST 2019. ""Return to Home Base"" was written several years ago and this festival, is perfect for its debut. I am both the writer and the composer for this play. In order to produce this play, we need to raise about <strong>$7,850.00 </strong>""Return to Home Base"" is a well-written play, and it is done in such a way that it can become a healing experience for many veterans who come to see it. Initially, I began writing this play for selfish reasons. I wanted to try and understand the things that happened to me while growing up in America and while I serving in Vietnam on a United States Navy destroyer. I suppose it was a form of healing for me as I battled with PTSD. However, soon I began to realize that <strong>""Return to Home Base""</strong> was not only about me because the lead character, Brain Keith, began to become a composite character of many Black soldier's and sailor's stories that I had heard over time after my return to the United States. America is so eager to show its might, that often, it doesn't want to know about the lives of the people that are actually sent into combat. I know this because I was medically evacuated out of Vietnam in November of 1972 in pretty bad condition. Not by wounds visited upon me by the enemy, but by those with whom I served.</p>
<p>Although I suffered many racial indignities and attacks as a service member in Vietnam aboard my ship, the USS Rupertus, DD851, I am still proud of my service to America. Yet, it is still important for me to be real about my service to understand what happened and why. As a writer, it is equally important for the viewers to understand how we as a nation and warring culture allowed ourselves to destroy valuable caring human beings during the Vietnam war, and why we fought with a cultural divide amongst blacks and whites who served together.</p>

<p>The Veterans Suicide Prevention Channel  (VSPChannel) was founded in 2015. The VSPChannel is a nonprofit 501 c3 organization dedicated to the preservation of veterans lives by working to prevent suicide. ""Return to Home Base"" is a part of the Austin Veterans Arts Festival (AVA,FEST) which has been created for the sole purpose of using the arts to save veterans lives. Art has become a powerful tool that helps heal veterans. The national AVAFEST festival is intended to attract veterans nationwide and introduce them to the curative power of art to promote wellness in vetreans who are suffering the symptoms of PTSD. PTSD symptoms including depression, anxiety, paranoia, guilt and anger often lead to the suicides of as many as 20 veterans a day. That is nearly 8,000 veterans a year lost to the senseless act of suicide. Our theme for this festival is ""HEALING VETERANS USING THE ARTS &amp; COMMUNITY.""</p>

<p>We are living in some very trying times these days. Racist, or seemingly racist, views are expressed on social media every day. People forget that many people of diverse cultures have given their lives for freedoms that we now enjoy in America. By helping us to produce this play for the festival, you will be reaffirming the fact that we as Americans embrace and honor every culture who has migrated to our shores and served in the military to defend our nation with their lives.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT THIS PLAY COULD MEAN TO BLACK VIETNAM VETERANS</strong></p>
<p>Why is it so important to have ""Return to Home Base"" in the AVAFEST festival for black Vietnam veterans? All branches of the military during the Vietnam war experienced racial upheavals because of perceived biases during that war. These biases have been practiced since the Civil War, WWI, WWII and other wars that preceded Vietnam. African American veterans traditionally have been forced to fight for a country that refused to give them the same rights and privileges that it afforded its other citizens. There were documented protests and even revolts in the military during the Vietnam war while African American sailors and soldiers served at a higher percentage, population wise, than their white counterparts.</p>
<p><br/>The Vietnam war was not fought by a volunteer army. The soldiers who fought were drafted, which was a way of saying, they were forced to fight because if you did not report to the military after you received a draft notice, you were breaking United States law and could be imprisoned. So, we had a situation during the Vietnam war where young black men were forced to join a military organization that was already biased against them and be sent far away from their homes to fight in a country they did not know, against people who had never done them any harm, while serving in a military unit that subjected them to racist treatment as part of their built-in system.</p>
<p><strong>""Return to Home Base"" </strong>can be healing for veterans to recognize what they went through as seen through the experience of the Black soldier presented in this play. The play, through its main character, Brain Keith, memorializes their treatment in that war and in America. In that way, <strong>""Return to Home Base""</strong> uplifts the African American veteran by way of showing some of the truths of their service that have been hidden away and never really discussed in the general public.</p>
<p>I wrote this play because I, too, was a victim of  racial injustice in Vietnam and I want the experience of veterans like myself to finally reach the light of day. It is in this way that this play, Return To Home Base may be able to promote some healing in veterans just by seeing it and hearin the songs. Please donate to day to bring Return To Home Base live at the National Austin Veterans Arts Festival.</p>

<h2>What is Bay Area Zeta Players?</h2>
<p>Bay Area Zeta Players is a completely student run theatre company based in Oakland. We started in 2014 as Nerdology Musical Theatre, and since expanded to include a student-written Ten Minute Play Festival, and have put on two straight plays over the past few years.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on selecting material that speaks to the teenage experience and is rarely seen on stage. Starmites: The Musical is a vibrant, 80's style piece of theater that is rarely performed, and we are excited to bring it to life on the stage! </p>
<h2><strong>We Need Your Help!</strong></h2>
</div><div>

We are a diverse group of students from a wide variety of backgrounds and we make it a priority for our company to give all students access to an inclusive ensemble that explores all aspects of theatre. Being a student run company creates an equal ground for anyone to share their ideas and everyone to feel supported and heard. First and foremost, BAZP strives to support high school students to use their passion for the arts to enrich the community.</p>

<p><strong>3. No teen pays to be a part of BAZP.</strong></p>
<p>Bay Area Zeta Players offers an immersive hands-on theatre education and experience to teens free of charge. No exceptions.

</div><p><i><strong>Thanks for your time!</strong></i></p></div>","What is Bay Area Zeta Players?
Bay Area Zeta Players is a completely student run theatre company based in Oakland. We started in 2014 as Nerdology Musical Theatre, and since expanded to include a student-written Ten Minute Play Festival, and have put on two straight plays over the past few years.
We pride ourselves on selecting material that speaks to the teenage experience and is rarely seen on stage. Starmites: The Musical is a vibrant, 80's style piece of theater that is rarely performed, and we are excited to bring it to life on the stage!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>New Industry Dance brings contemporary dance to South Bend through public performances, open classes, and community events. We strongly believe in the power of movement to heal, express, and connect. We aim to facilitate a safe space for all movers to engage in introspection, discovery, and personal expression. Through artistic collaboration and community engagement, we add dance as a valued language in the creative culture of South Bend and bring people together through our craft.</p>
<p>New Industry Dance functions in a highly do-it-yourself fashion; we do not have a brick and mortar space to call our own, and many of our spaces used for rehearsals, community events, and performances are generously offered to us by people and organizations in the community. Their support is crucial and without it, we could not continue our work.</p>
<p>As we prepare for our next season of dance in South Bend, we need your support. Your contribution will allow us to continue to collaborate and produce with voices in our community to create work born of diverse perspectives and art that inspires deeper thought, invites questions, and highlights human experiences. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>New Industry Dance needs your to help to raise $10,000. All funds raised will go toward production costs for the 2019-2020 season, including a large-scale community project.</p>
<p>Your contribution will assist in covering artistic and production costs, including:</p>
<p>Dancer stipends</p>
<p>Venue fees</p>
<p>Rehearsal space fees</p>
<p>Costuming fees (design, construction, materials)</p>
<p>Collaborating artist compensation</p>
<p>Marketing (print/web, graphic design, printing costs)</p>
<p>Photography and videography</p>
<p>Production supplies (props, curtains, miscellaneous)</p>
<p>New Industry Dance is a team of 8 dance artists (Chloe Ilene, Anna Greenawalt, Joanna Whitmyer, Sharon Sims, Mallory McAfee, Madeline Williamson, Isabelle Hanson, and Timothy McGinnis) and a company composer (Patrick Quiqley).</p>
<p>Our season contains public performances in the Winter and Spring. We will continue offering movement workshops, sound bath events, hosting guest artists, and performing at events like the Artists' Mixer.</p>
<p>Depending on your contribution level, you will receive supporter merchandise (sticker, T-Shirt, or poster), an invite to visit a rehearsal, mutual benefit support through program mentions or brand visibility on our website, season tickets, or be invited to a rehearsal. At the highest level, you will enjoy a full-length preview of a work and season tickets, or we will perform at one of your events, to be discussed with the artistic director.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>New Industry Dance adds to the cultural and artistic fabric of South Bend by providing public dance performances, open classes, movement workshops, sound bath events, and hosting visiting guest artists (bringing outsiders to South Bend).</p>
<p>Thanks to the money raised during last year's campaign, New Industry Dance was able to produce two evening-length productions (/in·habit/ and SENSORIMOTOR), host a three-part movement workshop series, continue open classes for the community, and host two visiting artists (Maceo Pailsey (LA) and Ron Shalom (NY)). We were also able to host sound bath and movement meditations events, with much success. Finally, we partnered with Browning Cinema at the DeBartolo Performing Arts Center to screen Bronx Gothic, a dance documentary.</p>
<p>Our work has an extended reach into a variety on non-arts organizations and educational institutions in our community, such as The LGBTQ Center and Clay High School, who have both hosted us for movement workshops. It is our hope that with the success of this campaign, we can continue to expand the depth of our reach within the educational system and at-risk communities.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>New Industry Dance produces all of our work purely from the contributions of our donors. We do not have any ongoing sponsorships or continued financial support. That means everything we do in one season relies on the contributions from this campaign. Our biggest risk is not raising enough money to support our upcoming season. Last year we increased our donor pool to around 60 persons. This year our goal is to increase our donor pool to 100-150 persons.</p>
<p>Your contributions to our campaign show a community commitment to prioritizing dance as an important language of creative expression and a necessary voice in our arts and culture scene. With the success of this campaign, we will produce two full-length productions, including a large community project supported by the Indiana Arts Commission in Spring 2020. We will continue to bring outside guest artists to South Bend, to offer community classes and events, and we will expand our reach into more educational institutions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot help fund this campaign right now, you can always contribute by sharing our fundraiser with others who may want to help. The Indiegogo share tools make it easy to spread the word!</p>
<p>In the meantime, stay tuned by following us on social media or subscribing to our email list. We hope to see you at a dance event soon!</p>

I am so excited to announce that EYESHADOW will be having an in-development workshop production at The Tank here in New York City in February of 2020. The EYESHADOW production team and I are asking for your support in helping us put this show up on its feet, and providing us with a stable grounding which will allow us to experiment and invest in the future of this show. </p><p> </p><h2>BRIEF SUMMARY OF <i>EYESHADOW</i>
</h2><p>In the time period directly succeeding desegregation and monumental movements in civil rights, disco, house, and dance music were forged as a modes of escape and entertainment for a number of marginalized individuals, particularly African American and queer individuals in urban environments. In these spaces, the life outside of the “break-down” was an afterthought, an aspect of the lived experience that needed to be set aside in order to continue on with life. </p><p>How, in the face of death, were these individuals able to find joy and self-expression? How could the aspiration for euphoria and higher forms of existence actually manifest for these individuals? And how do I, as a descendent of these individuals, find my own euphoria? I find myself turning back to this idea of the seemingly never-ending disco song. To dance meant to forget, or to acknowledge, or to do some strange combination of both. In their article discussing the cultural significance of disco, Tan Lin defines the genre as, “the line between singing and acting, listening and participating, between a celebrity and what Warhol called a ‘nobody’,”. In thinking about this project, I find that the celebrity and “nobody” are individuals that live inside each of us, and the line between them are as thick or thin as we desire them to be, or perhaps societal boundaries keep us from seeing the two existing on the same plane. </p><p>Inspired by interviews, various pieces of media, and oral history, If I Knew You Were Coming I Would Have Worn Eyeshadow finds Frisky Jones, a genderqueer sex worker balancing the line between celebrity and nothingness. In 60 minutes Eyeshadow remembers and showcases Frisky’s height and demise. Using “drag”, text, dance, lip sync, and experimental forms, the show explores what it means to escape one’s reality and, in doing so, what some must ultimately leave behind in a world set against us. Part repressed memory, part drag show, part interrupted stream of consciousness--Eyeshadow has several expectations, but then again, who has expectations these days?</p><p> </p><h2>WHY IT MATTERS</h2><p>Making new work as a young artist here in New York City presents a number of obstacles, one of the major barriers is funding. In the work that I create, I find it immensely important to create stories that highlight Black and LGBTQIA+ experiences, particularly with themes regarding race, gender, and sexuality’s relationship to society. While I do see a beautiful influx of new work that highlights marginalized communities, I also desire to establish myself as an artist here in New York City that is a part of the growing community of young experimental theater artists finding new ways to challenge what we define as “theater” and “performance”. </p><p>To be frank (and optimistic?), Eyeshadow’s development so far, and what has yet to come, has provided me with the opportunity to showcase my work, share cultural differences with international communities, and gain knowledge of new modes of storytelling. To see this show grow, would mean the world to me, and I see it introducing a number of opportunities not only for me, but also for the stellar production team that is helping bring this show to life. </p><p> </p><h2>FUNDING AND OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h2><p>The Tank has provided a great system for us to have space for showings, and technical support, however additional production costs are on our production team. We are seeking avenues to make costs as low as possible, but there are of course some things that we have to invest in such as technology, set pieces, costumes, etc. All of the funds that are accumulated through our crowd sourcing campaign will go towards the production and future of Eyeshadow including compensating collaborators, and production costs. </p><p>If you would not like to donate to this project, but would like to donate to a charitable organization, I highly recommend making a donation to the Audre Lorde Project, a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Two Spirit, Trans and Gender Non-Conforming People of Color community organizing center, focusing on the New York City area.</p><p>If you are able to make a donation to the organization independent of this production it would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Sharing this fundraiser page as well with your family and friends would also be immensely helpful. </p><p>No matter if you’re able to donate or share, we hope that you’ll join us in February 2020 at The Tank. And if you are unable to join us, sharing this campaign in your communities by word of mouth or any avenue, would help us greatly.</p><p> </p><h3>THE TEAM</h3><p>Julius Powell (Creator, Lead Artist)<br/>Rebecca Rouse (Scenographer, Collaborator)<br/>Myra McPhee (Dramturg, Collaborator)<br/>Caroline Burkhart (Choreographer, Collabrator)<br/>Callum Bayle-Spence (Visual &amp; Projection Design, Collaborator)<br/>Dan Lalor (Video and Photo Documentarian)</p><p>For more information on Julius, including their previous work, future work, and biography, visit juliusjordanpowell.com</p><p> </p></div>","OVERVIEWHello, my name is Julius Powell and I am the lead artist and creator of IF I KNEW YOU WERE COMING I WOULD HAVE WORN EYESHADOW--an experimental theater piece which was originally developed this summer at La Mama ETC’s Next Generation Artist Residency in Italy.

To see this show grow, would mean the world to me, and I see it introducing a number of opportunities not only for me, but also for the stellar production team that is helping bring this show to life.  FUNDING AND OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPThe Tank has provided a great system for us to have space for showings, and technical support, however additional production costs are on our production team. We are seeking avenues to make costs as low as possible, but there are of course some things that we have to invest in such as technology, set pieces, costumes, etc. All of the funds that are accumulated through our crowd sourcing campaign will go towards the production and future of Eyeshadow including compensating collaborators, and production costs. If you would not like to donate to this project, but would like to donate to a charitable organization, I highly recommend making a donation to the Audre Lorde Project, a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Two Spirit, Trans and Gender Non-Conforming People of Color community organizing center, focusing on the New York City area.If you are able to make a donation to the organization independent of this production it would be greatly appreciated. Sharing this fundraiser page as well with your family and friends would also be immensely helpful. No matter if you’re able to donate or share, we hope that you’ll join us in February 2020 at The Tank. And if you are unable to join us, sharing this campaign in your communities by word of mouth or any avenue, would help us greatly. THE TEAMJulius Powell (Creator, Lead Artist)Rebecca Rouse (Scenographer, Collaborator)Myra McPhee (Dramturg, Collaborator)Caroline Burkhart (Choreographer, Collabrator)Callum Bayle-Spence (Visual & Projection Design, Collaborator)Dan Lalor (Video and Photo Documentarian)For more information on Julius, including their previous work, future work, and biography, visit juliusjordanpowell.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>221B<br/>Baker Street, reimagined.<br/><br/>A new play by Ren Cleveland<br/>Inspired by the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle<br/><br/>Directed by Lorelei Lemon<br/>Creative team: Ren Cleveland and Zoe Barham</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're excited to say we're on the final leg of financial production for 221B. Big thank you's for all the support that's got us to this exciting stage. Production costs include: paying actors and designers, purchasing props, costumes, and scenic elements. A donation of any kind is deeply appreciated, as is sharing our campaign page with friends. We at Baker Street thank you sincerely for supporting our theatrical endeavors, and for helping us bring 221B to life for the triangle community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Summary...</p>
<p>A 2019 Manbites Dog Grant recipient, 221B is a fiercely female-driven reimagining of the Sherlock Holmes classics. Inspired by the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, this contemporary adaptation rips the roof off the iconic Baker Street residences and puts the world’s greatest consulting detective face-to-face with perhaps her most dangerous mystery to date - her own humanity. Join us as Sherlock and Watson navigate murder, marriage, and the infamous criminal mastermind, Professor Moriarty. 221B seeks to be a conversational catalyst for themes regarding gender-equality via an entertaining expedition through Holmes and Watson’s contemporary London.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note from the Playwright...</p>
<p>In response to the most common question we’ve received regarding the show - how did 221B come about? - I’d like to take this space to give a bit of background on how the play was written. <br/><br/>The seed for 221B was planted deep in the roots of my childhood when a tiny girl with messy hair and a strange affinity for the macabre fell in love with the tales of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s enigmatic detective.<br/><br/>Fast forward to my adulthood, when I found myself directing an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes and cast the title role as female. When I’d bump into folks and they’d ask what I was up to, their responses began to form a pattern.<br/><br/>“A female Sherlock. What a concept?”<br/><br/>My, “Yeah.” soon evolved into, “Wait. Not yeah. A female Sherlock shouldn’t actually be a radical concept at all, because quite frankly there is nothing about Sherlock that constitutes the need to be male.”<br/><br/>(The same could be said about a whole slew of other roles… but I digress! Save those for the next project.)<br/><br/>That notion was the spark that, ten insomnia-spiked drafts later, would become 221B.<br/><br/>When pen first hit paper, I set out with two goals.<br/><br/>1. By reframing the iconic roles of Sherlock and Watson as women, I wanted to challenge the societal constraints of gender roles. To turn up the volume, 221B places Sherlock and Watson in modern day to highlight the rather unsettling truth - that much of the opposition women faced in Victorian London still exists in society today.<br/><br/>2.

We're excited to say we're on the final leg of financial production for 221B. Big thank you's for all the support that's got us to this exciting stage. Production costs include: paying actors and designers, purchasing props, costumes, and scenic elements. A donation of any kind is deeply appreciated, as is sharing our campaign page with friends. We at Baker Street thank you sincerely for supporting our theatrical endeavors, and for helping us bring 221B to life for the triangle community.
 
Summary...
A 2019 Manbites Dog Grant recipient, 221B is a fiercely female-driven reimagining of the Sherlock Holmes classics. Inspired by the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, this contemporary adaptation rips the roof off the iconic Baker Street residences and puts the world’s greatest consulting detective face-to-face with perhaps her most dangerous mystery to date - her own humanity. Join us as Sherlock and Watson navigate murder, marriage, and the infamous criminal mastermind, Professor Moriarty. 221B seeks to be a conversational catalyst for themes regarding gender-equality via an entertaining expedition through Holmes and Watson’s contemporary London.
 
Note from the Playwright...
In response to the most common question we’ve received regarding the show - how did 221B come about? - I’d like to take this space to give a bit of background on how the play was written. The seed for 221B was planted deep in the roots of my childhood when a tiny girl with messy hair and a strange affinity for the macabre fell in love with the tales of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s enigmatic detective.Fast forward to my adulthood, when I found myself directing an adaptation of Sherlock Holmes and cast the title role as female. When I’d bump into folks and they’d ask what I was up to, their responses began to form a pattern.“A female Sherlock. What a concept?”My, “Yeah.” soon evolved into, “Wait. Not yeah. A female Sherlock shouldn’t actually be a radical concept at all, because quite frankly there is nothing about Sherlock that constitutes the need to be male.”(The same could be said about a whole slew of other roles… but I digress! Save those for the next project.)That notion was the spark that, ten insomnia-spiked drafts later, would become 221B.When pen first hit paper, I set out with two goals.1. By reframing the iconic roles of Sherlock and Watson as women, I wanted to challenge the societal constraints of gender roles. To turn up the volume, 221B places Sherlock and Watson in modern day to highlight the rather unsettling truth - that much of the opposition women faced in Victorian London still exists in society today.2. I wanted to showcase the characters as they were so brilliantly set forth by Doyle - as human beings - a matter that too often gets lost in translations that jump to frame the characters as archetypes. Sherlock’s, Watson’s, Mrs. Hudson’s, and Mycroft’s ability to thrive in the imaginations of fans through the decades is directly attributed to the fact that Doyle wrote them to be unapologetically human. To quote the script, “With all the broken pieces and eccentricities such a title entails.” We love them because we can relate to them.At its core, 221B was created for anyone and everyone who’s ever been told they can’t do something simply because of who they are, indiscriminate of gender.The hitch between Sherlock and conversations regarding gender roles seemed a perfect match for a detective who’s built their entire legacy off of not taking anything at face value. Sherlock stands for the underdogs, the unconventionals, the misunderstoods. You can’t do something simply because of who you are.Seems a rather ridiculous statement when you look at the words in a line, right? I like to think Miss Sherlock Holmes would take a look at the statement above, crack that ole I-know-something-you-don’t-know grin with her pipe in the corner of her mouth, and gladly accept the challenge that summarizes the driving force behind 221B. Prove ‘em wrong.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>I started out writing feature scripts after a successful book career on Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble. After completing seven production-ready scripts, I realized my Seattle location afforded a lot of obstacles to networking with Los Angeles studios and production companies.

From my written words, I watched actors, technicians, camera and grip creatives build the structure and erect a finished film. It was a fantastic learning experience.

organization specializing in professional musical theatre.  Our vision is to (1)
present classics as well as contemporary pieces, (2) exhibit diversity of
appeal and diversity of cultures (3) exhibit local and national talent (4)
prepare emerging artists for success in the professional musical theatre industry, and (5) cultivate original pieces from conception to premiere in San

Only 50% of theatre companies' income and financial stability is achieved solely by ticket sales and other earned income.  For any theatre company to flourish and remain financially stable, it relies on donations from organizations, private donors, volunteers, partnerships, corporate sponsors, grants, and fundraising efforts.  As a start up company we will not even be eligible for most of those until the year 2019.  That means we have to rely on our community for support… such as your beautiful self. 




Our Inaugural Season


Marines' Memorial Theatre, Sutter Street

Victoria Theatre, 16th Street

Victoria Theatre, 16th Street 


Our Campaign Budget
BAM!'s entire season budget is $133,000----which is only because many professional artists, designers, admins, and specialists are donating their talents and services because they believe in what we want to do.  We are asking for $10,000, less than 10% of our total annual budget, in this campaign to get us off the ground and running for our first production.  Here is what that covers:



Your Perks
BAM! isn't just about the artists, our shows, or musical theatre.  It is much, much more.  It's about YOU: the relationships you make with BAM!, your support for BAM!, and how we are able to better serve this beautiful city.  Because of your help with seeing this monumental project come to fruition, BAM! wants to make sure you know how important you are.  You mean A LOT to us.  Take a look for yourself:

 



Bay Area theatre artists Daren A.C. Carollo and Kimberly Dooley speak about supporting BAM! 

Listen to Daren A.C. Carollo (Producing Artistic Director of Berkeley Playhouse) and Kimberly Dooley (Bay Area favorite director & choreographer) talk about why they are involved with BAM! and how your support today, determines our future moving forward.

The Impact 

  With over 250 companies in the Bay Area between the North Bay, South Bay, East Bay, and San Francisco---- WHY START BAM! (Bay Area Musicals)? Here are FIVE POINTS that combined, make BAM! unique. 
1)  Diversity:
We utilize local professionals in non-traditional casting, administration, and
other artistic roles. All of our productions are chosen for a diverse audience
and are selected to appeal to a wide audience inclusive of diversity in age,
gender, race, and sexuality. We are a theater who reflect the world around us. 
2)  Professionalism: We use experienced Equity and non-Equity Actors, and pay all of our artistic staff, designers, and musicians.
3)  Creativity:
We will focus on creating original works for the musical theatre canon.  Integral to our mission is the cultivation of New Works from conception to production with world premieres in San Francisco. 
4)  Variety:
Our season of musical choices will vary in style, mood, setting, and content.
BAM! will be the only musical theatre company whose seasons present popular
classics, modern musicals, and New Works. 
And these New Works will be made possible through BAM!.  
5)  Innovation:
Our musicals will be told through original interpretations, presenting superior
musical theatre pieces in innovative ways that speak to today’s audiences, and
inspires new perspectives. 

Our project affects the entire San Francisco community…  especially YOU! Our project is valuable to our funders.  With this new company alone we will be 1) creating jobs by utilizing the Bay Area's top professionals, 2) provide a safe and inviting environment that induces creativity, 3) present a variety of musicals through innovative eyes, and 4) educate and train the audiences of tomorrow so theater continues to enrich the lives of the San Francisco community.  




The Team








Matthew McCoy, Founder & Artistic Director
To fulfill all of BAM!'s (Bay Area Musicals) objectives, Matthew McCoy, Founder & Artistic Director, has put
together a team of local artists and community leaders – including respected
Bay Area arts professionals, experienced development directors, attorneys, and
entrepreneurs.  Combined, the team has
over 200 years of experience in non-profit arts administration, event-based
marketing and regional, international and Off-Broadway theatre.  The team includes Daren A.C. Carollo (Artistic Advisor/Berkeley Playhouse Producing Artistic Director), Kimberly Dooley (Artistic Advisor/Director&Choreographer), Carnell Freeman (Board Member), Jon Gallo (Secretary/Resident Music Director), Wilson
Hardcastle (Vice President/Development), Michelle Ianiro (New

Risks & Challenges
What happens if we don't reach our goal? 
WE KEEP GOING! It will take up to three years to gain and build a devoted base of supporters who will continue seeing BAM! shows.  We might not reach that potential crowd with this fundraising campaign.  The money raised will go towards securing our most prominent needs in the season.  
What qualifies us to overcome this issue?
Our artistic and leading team is made up of the Bay Area's finest.  Each member is a specialist in their own field from marketing & finance to choreography & casting.  We are in great hands with the leaders of tomorrow's theatre.  

  Other Ways You Can Help 1) Can't give now? That's okay! BAM! still loves you and we want you to be a part of our growing future.  Please stay connected for future events, fundraisers, or season announcements by joining our newsletter HERE.
2) Save the date! Our first show, How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, will play November 28 -December 19, 2015.  Put that on your calendar NOW to join us.  Come see a show!
3)  It takes a village to put on a show and we can only succeed with your help.  Become part of the BAM! family by sharing this project with your friends and loved ones. Help support BAM! and spread the word.",9.0,2,"1 Campaign

<div>The Elektro Botz concept series is a collection of concept driven dance videos that will be unlike anything you've ever seen before. We are aiming for a ten video series all focused on completely different ideas. Each video in the series has a completely different feeling and story and will transport the audience into a different state of mind. We are looking for funding to bring the full vision to our audience the way we imagined it. With this project we will be creating ten completely different universes with their own stories and feelings being expressed through a new unique style of dance. </div>

</div><div>
<p>We are looking to raise 10,000 dollars to make this dream of ours come true. Funding is needed to acquire all of the necessary equipment and locations to bring this project to life. We are creating ten completely unique very dense realities and to do so the locations as well as the equipment( Camera equipment, Lighting, Special effects etc.) have to be up to the industry standard. </p>
<p>We wil be making a wide variety of perks for potential contributors, such as Elektro Botz merchandise, private Behind the scenes video packages, Film posters, and actual props from the set. </p>
<p>All funding will be pumped directly into this project to support every aspect of production. We intend on meeting our goal and believe that this project deserves the goal funding so that all ideas may be fully explored and we may deliver a finished product unlike anything else. If our goal is not met we will continue to produce this project to the best of our ability. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is extremely valuable to the dance and film community. The combination of these two art forms is unparalleled to anything else thats been made today. </p>
<p>The Elektro Botz Dance crew has previously produced a few short dance films on little to no budget and they have both done extremely well. They have gained a lot of positive acknowledgment in regards to both the dancing and the quality of the filmmaking.

Fontos szempont a halk és környezetbarát üzem, valamint hogy könnyen tudjuk szállítani a cuccot.
Ezt néztük ki:

http://www.szerszamvilag.hu/termekek/benzinmotoros-aramfejleszto-10kva-230v-hordozhato-szabalyozott-digitalis-kimdgi-10spA listaára a készüléknek úgy 200.000 Ft, de egy támogatónknak köszönhetően sikerül 130.000 Ft-ért hozzájutni. Erre jön még az Indiegogo és PayPal költsége, így kalkulációnk szerint kb. 155.000 Ft-ot kell összegyűjtenünk a generátor finanszírozására. Segítesz?
Kéne?
Sokszor kölcsönadtuk már ingyenesen az eszközeinket különféle nonprofit kezdeményezéseknek, eztán is így teszünk majd. Ha esetleg szívesen használnád a generátort, te is elkérheted néhány napra, csak annyit kérünk (ha nem nonprofit közösségi kezdeményezéshez kell) válaszd valamelyik kölcsönzős hozzájárulási csomagot.
Kösz!
Köszönjük, ha segítesz! Találkozunk az Erzsébet téren, a Várban vagy valamelyik másik táncos eseményünkön.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Inspiration and hopes
The initial idea with the film ""The fan keeps on spinning"" comes from the newly written poem with the same name. The poem describes the painful event on remembering intimacy, and how the world keeps on moving forward even though we might not.  


The fan keeps on spinning,
silence.
we drank, and drank, we poured, and poured,
we gave our hearts up, exposing every inch of us to each other,
letting our souls collapse and collide as poetry in motion.
The fan keeps on spinning,
silence.
the empty place next to me still smells of you, 
the dried mascara from your tears on my shoulder still burns, 
the sheets still resembles the last time you pressed your body into them,
and the warmth from your kiss still lingers on my chest as a reminder,
we keep on moving, 
the fan keeps on spinning,
you,
you,
you're the only one that knows the words.
   What We Need  The aim of the project is to raise 1942 GBP, which is the total amount required for the research project.
During the 12 weeks John will have access to studios, mentorship and guidance, but more importantly there's time for John to transform the idea into reality. 
In a world where we are becoming more and more disconnected with each other it's important to show that we still are humans. We feel stuff, we want to express stuff and we want to do stuff.

Which means he has no foreseeable way to pay for food, rent and utilities for the two years while he is a student!<br/></p><p>Because of his exceptional talent as an actor and theatre-maker, and because of the lack of available financial resources in his home country, Tafadzwa Bob Mutumbi of Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe has been awarded Dell'Arte's Merit and Need Advanced International Scholarship, so as to enable him to continue his theatre education at the Dell'Arte. The Scholarship will fund Tafadzwa's tuition in the Advanced Ensemble Program at Dell'Arte for the next two years.  </p><div>
<p>And this is exactly where you can help!</p>
<p>Please consider making a donation today to Tafadzwa’s Indiegogo campaign for his living expenses during his time in school. Your contribution will be helping a gifted young theatre artist to be able to realize his dream: to develop his own craft as an actor, and to create a performing arts centre in Zimbabwe that will provide free training and will be a place for Zimbabwean artists to nurture their artistic voices.</p>

</div><div><br/></div></div>","Tafadzwa came to the Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre last October as a student in the one-year Professional Training Program. Now, in order to accept a scholarship and complete his theatre training, Tafadzwa needs to raise enough money to cover his living expenses in the US for the next two years. As a citizen of Zimbabwe, Tafadzwa is ineligible for traditional financial aid or to work while in the States. Which means he has no foreseeable way to pay for food, rent and utilities for the two years while he is a student!Because of his exceptional talent as an actor and theatre-maker, and because of the lack of available financial resources in his home country, Tafadzwa Bob Mutumbi of Chitungwiza, Zimbabwe has been awarded Dell'Arte's Merit and Need Advanced International Scholarship, so as to enable him to continue his theatre education at the Dell'Arte. The Scholarship will fund Tafadzwa's tuition in the Advanced Ensemble Program at Dell'Arte for the next two years.  
And this is exactly where you can help!
Please consider making a donation today to Tafadzwa’s Indiegogo campaign for his living expenses during his time in school. Your contribution will be helping a gifted young theatre artist to be able to realize his dream: to develop his own craft as an actor, and to create a performing arts centre in Zimbabwe that will provide free training and will be a place for Zimbabwean artists to nurture their artistic voices.
If you can’t help financially, you can still pitch in by spreading the word. Whether by Facebook, Twitter, email, or word-of-mouth, we would love to see this campaign reach as many people as possible. Thank you for your time!

</div></div>","About Essential and the Festival: Essential Theatre has been supporting Georgia playwrights and presenting new plays to Atlanta audiences since 1987. Since 2012, the Essential Theatre Play Festival has presented all world premieres by Georgia playwrights. ""Our vision in moving forward,"" says Founding Artistic Director Peter Hardy, ""is to give Georgia playwrights an ever-stronger voice across the country and in the world, and in so doing, to continue to enrich our own community of artists and audience members here at home.""Towards that end, we are proud to present you with the seventeenth annual Essential Theatre Play Festival. This year's festival will be taking place July 24 through August 23 at the West End Performing Arts Center (945 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd, Atlanta, GA 30310). We're excited to be returning to West End, and we can't wait to share this year's shows with you:
Lillian Likes It by Joshua Mikel, winner of the 2015 Essential Theatre Playwriting Award (July 31-August 23, World Premiere). A young woman thinks she may have found the perfect guy -- unfortunately, he's dead, but does that really matter if she can still chat with him online? (There's an app for that.) A provocative comedy about the search for human connection in a time where we rarely meet face to face.
The Old Ship of Zion by Natalia Naman (July 24-August 21, Professional World Premiere). A warm, touching play about the members of a small African-American church, struggling to keep its doors open and adapt to changing times. Mama Gwen is a beloved elder who feels the burden of others who depend on the strength of her faith, and Quincy is a young man who loves his church but is beginning to realize that he's gay. About people searching for a spiritual life in trying times. With lots of music!
And of course we will be continuing our Bare Essentials play reading series with open readings of three new plays by Georgia writers. All readings are free and open to the public with discussion and feedback after.
  
The Impact

Essential Theatre is the longest-running theatre dedicated exclusively to supporting the work of Georgia playwrights. We’ve gained a lot of momentum over the past few years. Help us build on our past success and continue our forward momentum with this summer's festival!Your donations will help cover the cost of production materials, artist fees and promotion for the festival.

I see it as an opportunity to present a different kind of production, an intimate encounter with one of Shakespeare's most fascinating anti-heroes. For most of the play, Richard embraces the audience, takes them in his confidence and shares his plans with them with sly humor. In a much larger space, much of that intimacy is lost. Yes, Richard speaks to the audience, but it is difficult to feel that connection.</p>
<p>In thinking about mounting this production, I thought back on the best Richard I have seen, Ian McKellan's brilliant tour with the RSC. I was fortunate enough to be close to the stage and so felt the full force of that powerful performance. I also thought about a production of a show about a differently antiheroic Richard, President Nixon, I saw a number of times at the Odyssey back in 1988. I remember how the actor playing Nixon made me feel like he and I were alone in that little space.</p>
<p>I love the power that intimacy provides to pull the audience in and not let them go and I look forward to sharing this intimate Richard of Gloucester with audiences at ECT.</p> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Quid Pro Quo</span></h3>

We need the money to assist in our PR campaign to ensure our marvelous performers have the greatest number of people come and see them. None of these things are free.

</div></div>","Each of us has a purpose. And we believe that each person on earth was created with specific design and intention by our perfect Maker. We've been amazed by and blessed to discover artists throughout California, across the nation, and all over the world that have the same mission as ourselves: to use our God-given gifts of dance, music, song, and the arts to glorify our ultimate Creator. 







We are committed to making Project Light happen in order to spread the impact God has already done and continues to do through the arts to remind each other of the reason why we perform in the first place, to encourage and spur one another on to see how we and others are all making an impact for His Kingdom, and to testify to all that God touches and softens people's hearts in such a way that could only be described as an amazing encounter with Love.

Our current founding team is composed of members and directors of sister dance ministry teams Agape from UC Davis and Abba Modern from UC Berkeley. We cannot wait to see what new friendships, partnerships, and transformations Project Light will bring!We invite you to be a part of a one-of-a-kind event that is bringing together performers who want their audiences to know Christ! 




    



The purpose of our showcase is...


To unify Christian performers in mutual support upon seeing a bigger picture of what God is doing in performance culture to spread His love and strengthen His Kingdom.
To reawaken the reason behind why we dance, play music, or use any of our abilities for Him, and to reignite our hearts to work towards more, together.
To encourage Christian performers to continue drawing inspiration from Christ, and to remind the arts community that stewarding our gifts, time, and resources to help the world become better is a greater gift than winning titles or accolades.
To showcase the talents God has placed in performers, and to share the impact Jesus has made within all of us through these gifts.
To reveal a glimpse of God’s Kingdom to audiences by inspiring, emboldening, and providing community to other Christian artists who can mobilize in their own cities and use their talents for Him.
To project His Light, His Love, & His Truth!



Join us on April 30th, 2016 at the Palace of Fine Arts, SF. 






Purchase your ticket now with our ""Candle"" perk! 100% of proceeds go into making this showcase happen, including costs for:




Our estimated total cost is $16,000. This campaign is aiming for only half of that, as we are also reaching out to local churches and communities for offline sponsorships.

<p><b>SHORT SUMMARY</b></p>
<p><i>Α</i><i> cultural
project that emerges arts, tangible cultural heritage and social awareness on
equality issues</i></p>
<p>Drops of Breath is the first underwater dance
performance in the world. First that was presented on September 25th 2015 at
Cape Sounio, Attica, Greece. 15 performers 3 of them disabled
and 3 of them children, from France, Greece and Cyprus, took part in a unique experience under
the ancient temple of Poseidon. The audience had the option to view the
performance in three different ways: scuba diving, snorkeling over the set or
from a large projection on the coast.</p>
<p>It was more than just a
performance, it was artistry in its purest form and an immersive experience that
its purpose was to boast the ideals of true diversity in the realm of
dance. The weightlessness of submersion allowed those with disabilities to
embrace their ""inner mermaid"" and express themselves in ways that
could never be possible on land.</p>
<p>The creative artist set behind
Drops of Breath prides itself on the ideal of being multi-disciplinary, going
far beyond defending peoples' differences and the fact to work on the
exploration of humanity's similarities, highlights the values of sharing,
acceptance of the Other and empathy.</p>
<p>It really was
one of the most surreal art experience that one could imagine!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our dream
came true this September, now our vision is to continue this dream worldwide. </p>
<p><b>We want to continue. Support us.</b></p>

<p>“It was a unique
experience. As a diver I know the difficulties of floating and I want to say
that the dancers – divers were excellent at this very difficult enterprise” </p>
<p>“I had diving
lessons only to be able to watch this performance. It</p>

Α cultural
project that emerges arts, tangible cultural heritage and social awareness on
equality issues
Drops of Breath is the first underwater dance
performance in the world. First that was presented on September 25th 2015 at
Cape Sounio, Attica, Greece. 15 performers 3 of them disabled
and 3 of them children, from France, Greece and Cyprus, took part in a unique experience under
the ancient temple of Poseidon. The audience had the option to view the
performance in three different ways: scuba diving, snorkeling over the set or
from a large projection on the coast.
It was more than just a
performance, it was artistry in its purest form and an immersive experience that
its purpose was to boast the ideals of true diversity in the realm of
dance. The weightlessness of submersion allowed those with disabilities to
embrace their ""inner mermaid"" and express themselves in ways that
could never be possible on land.
The creative artist set behind
Drops of Breath prides itself on the ideal of being multi-disciplinary, going
far beyond defending peoples' differences and the fact to work on the
exploration of humanity's similarities, highlights the values of sharing,
acceptance of the Other and empathy.
It really was
one of the most surreal art experience that one could imagine!

Our dream
came true this September, now our vision is to continue this dream worldwide. 
We want to continue. Support us.

<p>This play has a much deeper resonance beyond being about folks who think they were comic book characters... most of the characters in the show are vets from the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars suffering from PTSD and searching for a way to alleviate their mental trauma.  </p>

<p>The Playwriting Collective, founded by Joshua Young, Lu Bellini, and Phillip Christian (all core members of <i>Who Mourns for Bob the Goon?</i>) formed this production company aimed at raising up voices from lower class backgrounds.  Specifically, The Collective is playwright driven, with a goal to finance and produce new works that support playwrights from poor economic environments and other marginalized communities.</p>
<p></p>

<p>The Collective's central premise contends that voices from poverty and lower class backgrounds seem to be continually underrepresented in the modern American theater landscape. As a group, The Collective aims to even the playing field against a system that gives an inherent advantage to artists from upper and middle class backgrounds.

<p>Each year, The Playwriting Collective will be giving out a $1,000 grant to an unknown, likely first-time, impoverished playwright and provide that writer with an opportunity to have their work developed and performed.

Bob starts to unravel after a new woman is admitted into the group who believes she's from an anime, not a comic.   It's the inaugural production of The Playwriting Collective, founded by Joshua Young, Lu Bellini, and Phillip Christian.

Why is this project special?
This play has a much deeper resonance beyond being about folks who think they were comic book characters... most of the characters in the show are vets from the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars suffering from PTSD and searching for a way to alleviate their mental trauma.  



The creators deeply believe that this piece is -above all- entertaining and a great play.  We don't believe it's an ""issue play"" at all... but at it's heart it has a somber and important message about how we fail to mourn and often overlook people whose lives impact us the most.  And we strongly believe the play isn't alienating politically, but rather promotes a message that speaks to everyone's sense of sympathy and conscious.

This show will premiere at the HERE Arts Center on July 9th and run through August 14th as part of their SubletSeries.  We're raising funds to adequately prepare this show for its full run as well as raise awareness of our new company and its social message; The Playwriting Collective is a new theater company aimed at giving voice to artists from lower economic backgrounds.
It's important to present to the world a piece of theater that isn't cheap and that has just as much care and attention put into executing the production as was put into the genesis and incubation of the show.  More importantly, as working artists, The Playwriting Collective believes in paying its collaborators.  We're working to change the standard of production to always include fair compensation for the participants and pay artists for their efforts  as qualified, diligent theatrical professionals.

To realize this element the show is using a combination of animations, projection, and projection mapping.  
(Below is one of the examples of our interactive, projected sets.)

In the fantasy realms, several characters also appear as a facsimile of their comic-book counterparts, and we want to give the audience the joy of seeing proper costumes not just cosplay.

Behind the campy and raucous dialogue, UNSEX’d is an opportunity to explore gender stereotypes and challenge society’s preoccupation with gender roles. Our production at Fringe will provide audiences a chance to engage with these important topics and experience a never-before-seen story.

<br/>
My initial interest in the art of ballet started due to my father and mother
working in Antalya State Opera and Ballet. <br/>
 <br/>
My father is a master stage hands and my mother is a costumer at the State
Opera and Ballet in Turkey. When I was 5 years old I’ve decided to be a ballet
dancer as soon as I saw the performances of ballet dancers and felt their
excitement and joy while dancing on stage.<br/>
 <br/>
I succeeded in the State Opera and Ballet’s children ballet audition and
therefore I joined the company. My education in children’s ballet company took
about 5 years and during that time I studied at the State Conservatory Ballet
Department of Antalya Mediterranean University in part-time schooling. Then my
mentor Mehmet Balkan, the chief choreographer of Directorate General of Turkish
State Opera and Ballet, suggested that I should apply to the audition to
receive education at Istanbul University State Conservatory Ballet Department
for improving my ballet skills. I applied to the audition in June 2010 and I
passed it successfully. So I have been eligible to attend Istanbul University
State Conservatory Ballet Department and still resuming my ballet education
there. All through my student years I took on some roles in various ballet and
opera productions as part of children’s ballet company. <br/>
 <br/>
Currently my biggest dream is to be a successful ballet dancer completing my
dance education in prominent and well-known ballet schools and represent the
beautiful aesthetics of the Art of Ballet to various audiences taking my part
in the renowned ballet companies. <br/><p></p>

</div></div>","Young Ballet Dancers Deniz Akarslan ve Berkay Günay, two Turkish young ballet dancers at ages 16 and 17. They are both students at Istanbul University State Conservatory Opera-Ballet. They have just recently won first and second place prizes in Grand Prix Ballet Competition that was held in US. Deniz won 1st place in classical and Berkay won 2nd place in modern dance categories. 
We wanted to raise our voices for these guys as Turkish society living in the US. We know how hard it is to come to states and achieve our goals. 
Our campaign is to raise money for these two young ballet dancers to come to New York City and compete in the finals. So we decided that through Indiegogo, we can help the star dancers of our future come and compete for the final round. 
The contributors will help make these young students achieve their dreams.  Deniz and Berkay are very successful young dancers and they do not want their dreams to fly away just because there is no budget from their school to send 2 kids to NYC. They are very determined to come and compete for the finals and it is their only chance to prove themselves in their career.    Funding We are helping out 2 dancers and 1 coach. Total of 3 people will b coming and staying throughout the competition. All the funding will be given to the dancers and their coach.
. Visa application fees
. Transportation and Room 
. Pocket money for their entire stay in the city 
. Rental studio space to practice throughout the competition. 
2 ballet students and their educator have to be in NY on April 10th, 2015. They are staying for 8 days and will depart back to Turkey on April 18th, 2015. 
Unfortunately it is a very short period of time but weather we raise the total funding or not they will receive everything from this fundraiser until the given date.

<p>In the last year some exciting things have been occurring in my life. First of all, our fundraising effort for <b>EQUUS</b> was achieved - raising $4,610! The production was a rousing success and we received incredible reviews including features in Broadway World, Houston Press and CultureMap Houston. Since last Summer, I've directed the main-stage production, Evita, for the Houston Family Arts Center with an equally talented cast. It has truly been wonderful to bring theatre to a diverse community as Houston.</p>
<p>I would like to continue to bring meaningful work to our city by staging Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize winning play, <b>ANGELS IN AMERICA</b>. Any time I'm seized by a work of art, it <u>haunts</u> me. I dream about it. It challenges me to explore its meanings. <b>ANGELS IN AMERICA</b><i> </i>has captivated me since I was a freshman in college. It follows several people. Prior Walter is a man whose life is torn apart when he is diagnosed with AIDS. Roy Cohn is in danger of losing his high-powered life due to an illness. Joe and Harper Pitt are fighting to keep their marriage intact as its threatened <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">by secrets, lies and Valium. Louis Ironson is running in fear that the consequences of his actions will catch up to him</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Enter the Angel, a beautiful, terrifying and powerful being who is in need of a human prophet. All of these stories intersect in the high stakes world of 1985.</span></p>
<p><b>ANGELS IN AMERICA</b> explores humanity and the triumph of fighting for every breath we take. I am truly inspired by the production. I know that it will add to the rich culture of <b>Houston</b> Theatre... the theatre of the future.</p>
<p>I grew up in a church where visions and prophecies happened often. Spirituality is such an important part of my work as an artist. I am constantly exploring issues related to spirituality and its duality. What is the realm of the spiritual - that place between life and death? It is a question that is explored in all art. The unknowable question. Theatre has its origins in religious celebration. I want to capture the ritual power of the theatre in this production. As we explore the humanity of these characters and experience a few bells and whistles, I hope that this production is transformative to you, the audience member. I believe that the arts are often prophetic. They encourage humanity to move forward and grow, or to warn of doom due to injustice. In <b>ANGELS IN AMERICA</b>, Tony Kushner was the prophet for the gay community during the plague of the 1980s. It is important to bring this play to <b>Houston</b> with our exciting production of <i>Angels in America Parts 1 and 2.</i></p>
<p>I appreciate that the play examines a multi-faceted view on spirituality. Some of the characters are deeply spiritual, and all are deeply human.

</div></div>","Short Summary My friends,
In the last year some exciting things have been occurring in my life. First of all, our fundraising effort for EQUUS was achieved - raising $4,610! The production was a rousing success and we received incredible reviews including features in Broadway World, Houston Press and CultureMap Houston. Since last Summer, I've directed the main-stage production, Evita, for the Houston Family Arts Center with an equally talented cast. It has truly been wonderful to bring theatre to a diverse community as Houston.
I would like to continue to bring meaningful work to our city by staging Tony Kushner's Pulitzer Prize winning play, ANGELS IN AMERICA. Any time I'm seized by a work of art, it haunts me. I dream about it. It challenges me to explore its meanings. ANGELS IN AMERICA has captivated me since I was a freshman in college. It follows several people. Prior Walter is a man whose life is torn apart when he is diagnosed with AIDS. Roy Cohn is in danger of losing his high-powered life due to an illness. Joe and Harper Pitt are fighting to keep their marriage intact as its threatened by secrets, lies and Valium. Louis Ironson is running in fear that the consequences of his actions will catch up to him. Enter the Angel, a beautiful, terrifying and powerful being who is in need of a human prophet. All of these stories intersect in the high stakes world of 1985.
ANGELS IN AMERICA explores humanity and the triumph of fighting for every breath we take. I am truly inspired by the production. I know that it will add to the rich culture of Houston Theatre... the theatre of the future.
I grew up in a church where visions and prophecies happened often. Spirituality is such an important part of my work as an artist. I am constantly exploring issues related to spirituality and its duality. What is the realm of the spiritual - that place between life and death? It is a question that is explored in all art. The unknowable question. Theatre has its origins in religious celebration. I want to capture the ritual power of the theatre in this production. As we explore the humanity of these characters and experience a few bells and whistles, I hope that this production is transformative to you, the audience member. I believe that the arts are often prophetic. They encourage humanity to move forward and grow, or to warn of doom due to injustice. In ANGELS IN AMERICA, Tony Kushner was the prophet for the gay community during the plague of the 1980s. It is important to bring this play to Houston with our exciting production of Angels in America Parts 1 and 2.
I appreciate that the play examines a multi-faceted view on spirituality. Some of the characters are deeply spiritual, and all are deeply human. Some of the most compassionate people in the play are those who are often demonized in the media.  I believe this play can cause meaningful dialogue between the gay, Mormon and Christian communities which could move society forward.
To tell a story as profound as ""Angels"", we need amazing actors. For doing great work, I am a strong believer in paying performers. The funds I am asking for will go directly to their salaries and rental of a quality venue. Most will go directly to the pockets of the brave performers who choose to work in a field that often pays nothing. I want to do great theatre that contributes to the actors.
We have proven before that we can create great theatre with little funding. Please help us pay the artists and make their dreams a reality. 
Thank you for your time and support.
Matthew C. Logan

<h3>Here's Our Hope:</h3>
<div>My name is Bobby Wise and I am here to raise money for one of my best friends &amp; future leader in the arts, <b>Lydia Nightingale</b>. Her original play titled ""<i>Adele in Berlin</i>"" has officially been accepted into The Riant Theatre's Strawberry One-Act Festival held in New York City during the month of August! <span>As this is her dream come true, it was AMAZING news for both her and the rest of us that found out ^_^</span>
</div>
<div><span><i>BUT then the reality of the situation kicked in...</i></span></div>
<div>
<span>You see, even though her play is in the festival, there is still: a registration fee, travel expenses round trip from Albany, food, costuming &amp; general supplies that just ADD UP <b>SO</b> FAST! Not to also mention that </span><span>s</span><span>he is 25 years old, has a costly BA from SUNY New Paltz in Theatre to pay for, and just like all of the rest of us in this Generation, has zero money after all of the bills are paid... </span><span>Therefore, she doesn't think that she will be able to afford doing this, even though it's only a couple hundred dollars.</span>
</div>
<div><span>But that's <i>'Merica</i> for ya!  The land FULL of opportunities, that only people with money are able to take advantage of...</span></div>
<div>
<span></span><span>SO, that is why I am asking for your support in raising this EXTREMELY small amount of money to prove that this world is still full of the magic that's seen when dreams come true. </span>

</div></div>","Here's Our Hope:
My name is Bobby Wise and I am here to raise money for one of my best friends & future leader in the arts, Lydia Nightingale. Her original play titled ""Adele in Berlin"" has officially been accepted into The Riant Theatre's Strawberry One-Act Festival held in New York City during the month of August! As this is her dream come true, it was AMAZING news for both her and the rest of us that found out ^_^

BUT then the reality of the situation kicked in...

You see, even though her play is in the festival, there is still: a registration fee, travel expenses round trip from Albany, food, costuming & general supplies that just ADD UP SO FAST! Not to also mention that she is 25 years old, has a costly BA from SUNY New Paltz in Theatre to pay for, and just like all of the rest of us in this Generation, has zero money after all of the bills are paid... Therefore, she doesn't think that she will be able to afford doing this, even though it's only a couple hundred dollars.

But that's 'Merica for ya!  The land FULL of opportunities, that only people with money are able to take advantage of...

SO, that is why I am asking for your support in raising this EXTREMELY small amount of money to prove that this world is still full of the magic that's seen when dreams come true. 


SHE IS A BEAUTIFUL WRITER WITH A NICHE IN CREATING WORKS THAT EXPOSE HISTORICAL CONTROVERSY & SHED LIGHT ON BOTH SIDES OF CONFLICT (In other words, it's super worthwhile because her work is stuff you don't ever really hear about, but events in history that you should've always been aware of.) 


Lydia's Expenses:
Participation Fee: $300 (PAID DIRECTLY TO RIANT THEATRE & covers everything on the festival's end of things)
Round Trip Train Rides: $480 (Ave. $80 from Albany to Penn Station, 6 times)
Supplies & Food: $100

Behind this success hide 8 years of hard work and the tremendous efforts of each of the members who have hoped that one day, they could create a `playground` that theatre lovers and art lovers in general could benefit from.
For 2017, we proposed ourselves to make one step ahead and change the status of the festival to`international` but this is still only a dream, and that is why we need your help. We know that everyone can make a difference and we want to give you a chance to do that.

The Jury is composed of experts in theatrical pedagogy:
UNATC Instructors,TV hosts at the National Broadcasting Service of Romania, radio hosts, actors and actresses.
This first edition was the solid basis we needed in order to build up a strong, high class, national and even international competition in the following years.
Our goals are the main goals that define our troupe:""Education through theatre""

In the Western countries this form of education is implemented in the scholar curriculum while in Romania it only occurs thanks to the ambition of some truly art devoted people.
Starting from the second edition, a new section was introduced: `College`, where shows produced by UNATC and The Hyperion University delighted the audience. 
The name of our troupe, `OKaua` stands for our creed to take the measure of everything using a unique scale, the scale of TRUE VALUE and COMPETITION. ""OKaua"" is in romanian language a unit of measure from the 19th century.This creed, inspired by William Shakespeare’s works, gave birth to the motto of the festival: `Measure for Measure`

We were the only high school troupe in Romania invited to play in professional festivals, including The International `Shakespeare` Festival, for three editions in a row so we know how important it is for a festival to invite both professionals and professionalized amateurs.
Troupes from all over the country will be invited at this 4th edition.
In order to encourage and help the development of the Arts in Romania, we want to add more diverse categories in this 4th edition. We already have a Prizes for Outstanding Voice, Costumes, and Posters and now we want to new categories for craft : Best Theatre Mask ""Ion Sava"" and a Best Scenographic Model/Miniature Mock-up ""George Baron Lowendal"". Additionally the winning Theatre Mask will be worn at the Carnival of Venice by OKaua Theatre Companys members who hopefully be performing there in 2017.
Also, daily workshops will be held by professionals and video projections will be screened.
Our festival wants to add even more forms of art at future editions like : theater - dance, theater animation, sports theater, pantomime, musical shows, and puppet theater.
We need this fundraising in order to pay for the transport, food and accommodations for every international or national troupe that would like to join us and every person who wants to see the performances but does not have the means to do it.
The present stage of the festival

Period: Between 12th - 15th of May 2016
Location: The Student's Cultural House of Bucharest (Bucharest)
Structure:-Show CompetitionTwo Competitional Sections:-High School (besides the play in the contest, there will be another `Short Play`, with a given sequence of a script)-College (besides the play in the contest, there will be an impromptu)-Dance and Theatre acts outside the competition-Workshops-Theatre Crafts Competition
The Grand Prix of this Festival can be awarded to both a High School or a College Show.
We would be pleased with any help that you can give, maybe a share, or a facebook like, a kind word, is all you have to give right now, and we really appreciate it.
We self-finance ourselves through the contributions of each and every member and this is how we mostly have financed our festival, a lot of people/little sponsors have joined our cause but they are not enough for what we want to build.

<h3><b>Le Programme de bourse TransFormation </b></h3>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>Le Programme de bourses de TransFormation a été conçu afin de venir en aide aux artistes professionnels et pré- professionnels qui bénéficieraient grandement d’une participation à une portion ou à la totalité du stage.<br/></p>
<p>Le stage TransFormation est un événement unique qui offre non seulement des opportunités aux danseurs de rencontrer les artistes créateurs d’ici et d’ailleurs, mais qui renverse aussi la dynamique et permet aux chorégraphes et répétiteurs de voir ces artistes dans leur propre travail, d’explorer avec eux pendant une semaine ou plus et de créer des affinités. C’est un vecteur d’échanges dans un territoire où peuvent naître des collaborations, des opportunités professionnelles et des projets fertiles qui seraient impossibles dans un simple contexte d’audition.</p>

<h3>The TransFormation Scholarship Program</h3>

<p><b>TransFormation Scholarship Program</b> is designed to <b>provide assistance</b> to professional and pre-professional artists who would benefit from attending either the full, or a specified component of the programming.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>TransFormation</b> is a <b>unique event</b> which not only <b>offers opportunities</b> for dancers to <b>work closely with creators</b> from Montreal and abroad, but also allows choreographers and rehearsal directors to see the artistes within their own work, exploring and creating with them throughout a week or two creating  kinships. It is a vector for exchange in which collaboration, professional opportunities and fertile projects are born, something that is impossible in the context of a single audition.</p>

<p>The benefit of the Scholarship program goes beyond my personal development, but affects and enforces cross-cultural sharing of information as the knowledge gained affects many others through the sharing of our experience and invokes a series of new thought and ideas.

Transformation est un atelier intensif de danse contemporaine qui chevauche le Festival TransAmériques et le OFFta ce qui permet aux participants de baigner littéralement dans la création contemporaine. TransFormation accueille des danseurs d'horizons diverses ayant des vues et intérêts éclectiques. Cela contribue à en faire un espace/temps unique.


Pour souligner notre 10e anniversaire nous vous encourageons à donner 10$!
╰☆╮ 10$ fait une différence!!╰☆╮


Un soutien à nos danseurs!

Le Programme de bourse TransFormation 

Le Programme de bourses de TransFormation a été conçu afin de venir en aide aux artistes professionnels et pré- professionnels qui bénéficieraient grandement d’une participation à une portion ou à la totalité du stage.
Le stage TransFormation est un événement unique qui offre non seulement des opportunités aux danseurs de rencontrer les artistes créateurs d’ici et d’ailleurs, mais qui renverse aussi la dynamique et permet aux chorégraphes et répétiteurs de voir ces artistes dans leur propre travail, d’explorer avec eux pendant une semaine ou plus et de créer des affinités. C’est un vecteur d’échanges dans un territoire où peuvent naître des collaborations, des opportunités professionnelles et des projets fertiles qui seraient impossibles dans un simple contexte d’audition.

╰☆╮ 10$ fait une différence!!╰☆╮

Grâce à la générosité de nos partenaires du Programme de Bourse TransFormation nous avons déjà réussis à amasser 2500$. C'est maintenant vers vous, notre chère communauté, que l'on se tourne afin de faire appel à votre aide pour soutenir les artistes en donnant à notre programme de bourse 10$ pour notre 10e anniversaire. 


                                    ╰☆╮ ╰☆╮ ╰☆╮ 

En 2015, des bourses totalisant plus de 3500$ ont été accordées à 8 récipiendaires.

Un message de Julie Tymchuk:

Se transformer, grandir au sein d'une communauté qui fait preuve d'ouverture d'esprit et de respect est une des plus belles expériences que l'on peut vivre en tant qu'être humain. Pour moi, le stage est synonyme de ce sentiment.
Je participe au stage Transformation depuis plus de 8 ans. Chaque expérience fut unique, teintée par les différents artistes invités. Le seul dénominateur commun est le bonheur de danser dans un contexte riche et stimulant.

The TransFormation Scholarship Program

TransFormation is an annual contemporary dance intensive which overlaps with the Festival TransAmériques and the OFFta. It provides participants with total immersion in the world of cutting-edge contemporary dance and creation. TransFormation brings together dancers from different horizons with different views and interests. Together these factors make for a very unique and enriching experience. 




To celebrate our 10th anniversary we encourage you to donate $10!
╰☆╮$10 makes a difference!╰☆╮

The TransFormation Scholarship Program

TransFormation Scholarship Program is designed to provide assistance to professional and pre-professional artists who would benefit from attending either the full, or a specified component of the programming.


TransFormation is a unique event which not only offers opportunities for dancers to work closely with creators from Montreal and abroad, but also allows choreographers and rehearsal directors to see the artistes within their own work, exploring and creating with them throughout a week or two creating  kinships. It is a vector for exchange in which collaboration, professional opportunities and fertile projects are born, something that is impossible in the context of a single audition.


╰☆╮ $10 makes a difference!╰☆╮



© Anne-Flore de Rochambeau
Thanks to the generosity of TransFormation Scholarship Partners, we have already raised $2500 in scholarships for the 10th anniversary edition. It is at this point that we turn to you, our community, and ask for you help in supporting our artists by donating to the scholarship program. 


Support for our artists!10$ for our 10th anniversary!


In 2015, a total of $3500 in scholarships were awarded to 8 artists!

A few words from Joshua Sailo:

The benefit of the Scholarship program goes beyond my personal development, but affects and enforces cross-cultural sharing of information as the knowledge gained affects many others through the sharing of our experience and invokes a series of new thought and ideas. I look forward to an invigorating and enriching few weeks at Transformation 2016

<h3>Bref résumé</h3>Marie-Denise Bettez et Marika Dumoulin sont deux jeunes artistes à têtes fortes 
qui ont élaboré un projet de recherche autour du thème de la femme vulnérable. 
Ce projet a mené à la pièce <i>F E M</i>, qui sera présentée au Festival Fringe 
de Montréal en juin 2016. <br/><br/>Étant toutes deux artistes de la relève, elles 
ont décidé de faire une demande de subvention au Conseil des Arts du Canada afin 
de pouvoir payer les trois chorégraphes et l'interprète du projet qui 
travailleront chacun entre 30 et 120 heures et pour se payer elles aussi, en 
tant qu'interprètes et chargées de projet pour les quelque 200 heures investies. 
À travers le Canada, seulement quelques projets recevront une subvention. Même 
si elles espèrent de tout leur cœur obtenir ce financement,  il n'y a aucune 
garantie que le gouvernement soutiendra le Projet F E M. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3> Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Pour la production au festival, nous devons payer de notre poche (en 
attendant de, peut-être, recevoir de l'aide financière du gouvernement) : 

</p>
<p>- Le diffuseur</p>
<p>- Tout le matériel promotionnel (photo, images, affiches, affichettes, 
communiqué de presse, impression)</p>
<p>- Les studios de répétitions</p>
<p>- Les collaborateurs (graphiste, éclairagiste, concepteur sonore)</p>
<p>- Décors, costumes, accessoires
</p>
<p>- Réseautage lors du festival</p>
<p>- Cachets des artistes
</p>
<p>- Et bien plus encore</p>
<p>Nous aimerions amasser 5000 $ afin de payer tous ces services, mais quel que 
soit le montant récolté, petit ou grand, il nous sera d'une aide incommensurable 
pour le développement du projet.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3> L'impact</h3>
<p>Il n'est jamais heureux qu'un travail artistique accompli nous laisse dans le négatif. Le Projet F E M nous tient tellement à cœur que nous voulons qu'il soit une réussite totale. Comme nous en sommes encore à nos premières expériences d'élaboration de projet, il est important pour nous que cette opportunité se classe comme étant une expérience positive et mémorable. <br/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Risques et défis</h3>
<p>Nous sommes prêtes à travailler sans garantie de salaire, c'est pourquoi nous 
nous considérons comme des artistes dévoués à leur art. Par contre, nous 
essaierons par tous les moyens que notre travail soit rémunéré et nous ne sommes 
pas du genre à laisser tomber au premier obstacle. Nous sommes des guerrières et 
nous voulons que notre travail soit reconnu! Aidez-nous à valoriser notre art!

Who Are These People?
Equally Represented Arts (ERA)
ERA is an independent, experimental theatre company based in St. Louis, MO.
Mission: Theatre is a collaborative, multi-disciplinary, live art form. ERA's mission is to use the elements unique to theatre's identity to expand the possibilities for what that art for can be, thereby challenge expectations for meaning in theatre, art, and the world. We root ourselves in the believe that all theatre's components are equal, and that innovation stems from experimentation.
Poor Monsters
Poor Monsters is an experimental theatre company concocting new works and fighting for gender parity.
Slightly Askew Theatre Ensemble
Slightly Askew Theatre Ensemble (SATE) is a non-profit, 501(c)(3), with the mission to encourage and enable an intense exploration of movement-based theatre through ongoing training, education, and collaboration.The company is comprised of artists from varying disciplines devoted to movement training, the telling of stories through an exploration of words, movement, and sound, educational outreach, and the creation and development of new theatrical works and the revisiting of established works as an ensemble.
YoungLiars

#moreartlessadminYoungLiars is a loosely-knit collective of like-minded artists committed to creating unique inter-disciplinary theatre performance, including both original works and radically entertaining re-imaginings of the classics. We believe that magic is created through the fusion of different art forms and that bold simple theatricality will set hearts and minds on fire. We believe that the theatrical experience is richer and deeper than simple voyeurism and that audiences, now more than ever, crave engagement and involvement, and want to be challenged rather than placated.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>Rhythmic Motion is an evening length dance concert exploring the body as an instrument in
movement and the rhythmic interconnections of movement and sound. This
intimate concert brings the audience close to the movement in the beautiful
wood floored Headwaters Studio in Missoula, MT. The concert explores the use of
body percussion, vocals, breath, live
music, designed sound scores, and sound creation within contemporary modern
movement. It also incorporates Dance
for Camera elements through dance for camera videos and the interaction between
projection and live dance. </p>

along with tech designers including sound and lighting. It will be presented May 18th and 19th 2015 at the Headwaters Studio in Missoula, MT. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The concert features a range of pieces that
explore a wide variety of live sound creation and designed soundscapes. It is
an innovative exploration of a movement language developed through sounds and
movement coming and interacting together. The work is textured, powerful,
expansive, detailed, layered, and passionate. Rhythmic Motion is family
friendly and fun for all ages. </p>

</div><h3><u><b>Rise of the Scorpion
Seductress</b></u></h3><h4>By: Cristina McLaughlin</h4>
<p><i>A woman bereft of power or influence dares to use her
feminine wiles to seduce the most powerful men in Ancient Egypt transforming
her from a slave into the queen she knew in her heart she was always meant to
be.  Her new position swaths her in
comfort and luxury but her resolve is shaken witnessing the brutal practice of
female sacrifice.  Ultimately, she will
risk all she has gained to stand in solidarity with her fellow women ...even if
the cost could be her life.</i></p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430866196/pz94bprjnnobcvkufrtl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3><b>How did it all begin?</b></h3>
<p>In July of 2014 I met Betty (my producer); she was a self-made entrepreneur experienced
in producing small scale events in her Manhattan loft with a vision of breaking
into the theatre world.  I was a high
school English/Drama teacher with a passion for writing ...and no money.  After discovering our mutual love for the
arts, we decided to meet and discuss the possibility
of starting a project together.  A few
days later, armed with my trusty padfolio, I presented my ideas.  Impressed, Betty offered her venue if I was
able to provide the script. </p>
<p>Over the next few weeks when I wasn’t furiously writing,
Betty and I were constructing our plan.  By summer’s end, we had a team of people who
could make the play a reality and a finished script.  Together with Irmingard, our artistic director,
we began casting and preparing for a “teaser” production of Act One.  </p>
<p>After weeks of rehearsal we successfully performed to our
first audience of 60 people.  The show
was a resounding success, but our progress was halted when we realized that the venue was not sufficient to provide the capacity needed for a full production show.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430867221/nn6ykmqnt2buww5dk2im.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h3><b>What is the
inspiration?</b></h3>
<p>Primarily, this is a story about female sexual
exploration.  In spite of reading a prolific amount of noteworthy feminist literature, I never read about a sexually liberated woman
that was a champion of other women.  In
literature (and life) women are punished or isolated when they are too “free”
with their bodies.  I wanted to challenge
that notion in a profound and believable way. 
Achieving that paved the way for the acrobatic element of the show which
makes this visually tantalizing. The experience of a voyeur is created as spectators are immersed in a sexually charged environment.  Our cast has
elevated the production to a theatrical masterpiece expressing the story through
extraordinary feats of lyra, pole dancing and ariel net.</p>
<p>However, in many ways the story is inspired by my own
personal  journey.  I was a victim of child abuse, and although
everyone in my family, school and community knew about it, nothing was
done.  My protagonist is the woman I use
to dream would come, see the injustice of my suffering and rescue me.  Her character has been developed and refined
since her original conception, but the vividness of her spirit remains.  She encapsulates how the best parts of
our character are drawn into the light when we stand together to fight
injustice.  </p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>Why is this project
important?</b></h3>
<p>To sum it up in 2 words: female empowerment.  Although women have made extraordinary
strides in the pursuit of equality and liberation, socially we are still very
much repressed.  Women are still shamed
and judged if we use our sexuality with the same brazen attitude as men.  Worse, women are sometimes our own worst
enemies; we will callously label women as “whores,” and use that condemnation as a
means to mock other women when they are victimized, or to remain resolute in our apathy.  This show challenges women to
raise one another up, see how we’re alike in our struggles, and how powerful we
can become when unified.  </p>
<p>A testament to that possibility is the project itself.  Since all of the creators of this project are
women from very different walks of life who came together to create this unique
show.  Proving the adage, that life
imitates art.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430868222/pouqxhtvzsay0m183kli.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

SeductressBy: Cristina McLaughlin
A woman bereft of power or influence dares to use her
feminine wiles to seduce the most powerful men in Ancient Egypt transforming
her from a slave into the queen she knew in her heart she was always meant to
be.  Her new position swaths her in
comfort and luxury but her resolve is shaken witnessing the brutal practice of
female sacrifice.  Ultimately, she will
risk all she has gained to stand in solidarity with her fellow women ...even if
the cost could be her life.
How did it all begin?
In July of 2014 I met Betty (my producer); she was a self-made entrepreneur experienced
in producing small scale events in her Manhattan loft with a vision of breaking
into the theatre world.  I was a high
school English/Drama teacher with a passion for writing ...and no money.  After discovering our mutual love for the
arts, we decided to meet and discuss the possibility
of starting a project together.  A few
days later, armed with my trusty padfolio, I presented my ideas.  Impressed, Betty offered her venue if I was
able to provide the script. 
Over the next few weeks when I wasn’t furiously writing,
Betty and I were constructing our plan.  By summer’s end, we had a team of people who
could make the play a reality and a finished script.  Together with Irmingard, our artistic director,
we began casting and preparing for a “teaser” production of Act One.  
After weeks of rehearsal we successfully performed to our
first audience of 60 people.  The show
was a resounding success, but our progress was halted when we realized that the venue was not sufficient to provide the capacity needed for a full production show.What is the
inspiration?
Primarily, this is a story about female sexual
exploration.  In spite of reading a prolific amount of noteworthy feminist literature, I never read about a sexually liberated woman
that was a champion of other women.  In
literature (and life) women are punished or isolated when they are too “free”
with their bodies.  I wanted to challenge
that notion in a profound and believable way. 
Achieving that paved the way for the acrobatic element of the show which
makes this visually tantalizing. The experience of a voyeur is created as spectators are immersed in a sexually charged environment.  Our cast has
elevated the production to a theatrical masterpiece expressing the story through
extraordinary feats of lyra, pole dancing and ariel net.
However, in many ways the story is inspired by my own
personal  journey.  I was a victim of child abuse, and although
everyone in my family, school and community knew about it, nothing was
done.  My protagonist is the woman I use
to dream would come, see the injustice of my suffering and rescue me.  Her character has been developed and refined
since her original conception, but the vividness of her spirit remains.  She encapsulates how the best parts of
our character are drawn into the light when we stand together to fight
injustice.  
Why is this project
important?
To sum it up in 2 words: female empowerment.  Although women have made extraordinary
strides in the pursuit of equality and liberation, socially we are still very
much repressed.  Women are still shamed
and judged if we use our sexuality with the same brazen attitude as men.  Worse, women are sometimes our own worst
enemies; we will callously label women as “whores,” and use that condemnation as a
means to mock other women when they are victimized, or to remain resolute in our apathy.  This show challenges women to
raise one another up, see how we’re alike in our struggles, and how powerful we
can become when unified.  
A testament to that possibility is the project itself.  Since all of the creators of this project are
women from very different walks of life who came together to create this unique
show.  Proving the adage, that life
imitates art.
Who is also involved
in creating this project?
Betty Tricoche is
a spectacular woman who generously invested her space for our performers,

<a name=""bullet1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h4>What's the what with RipCity Dance</h4>
<p>RipCity Dance is a new dance and movement company in Seattle.  We offer classes for families and intergenerations of every size, color, gender and variety to take together.</p>
<p>We believe families who dance together have fun together, and build stronger communities.  The best experiences in life happen as we share between generations, in families, and with friends.  Dance and movement offer a unique opportunity for people to have fun, become more fit, learn new skills, communicate in new ways, and enjoy the experience of a shared community experience.</p>
<a name=""bullet2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h4>Getting from there to here</h4>
<p><a href=""http://www.ripcitydance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RipCity Dance</a> is owned and operated by me, Steven Ripley.  Encouraged by my mom, Bobbie Stewart, since I was a child, I have worked in the arts as a playwright, author, stage manager, performer, and for the past four years, as a dancer.  My teachers have included Elia Mrak, Victoria Jacobs, David Zambrano, Elizabeth Davis-Thomas, Brian Bucsit, Irene Lyon and Nancy Lopez Luna, practicing qigong and yoga, Flying Low and Passing Through techniques, hip hop and breakdance, and the beauty and whimsicality of going slow to explore and engage somatic awareness.</p>
<p>I also worked for 18 years for the City of Seattle as a web designer and developer, and an emergency first responder during citywide emergencies.  I retired from the City in April 2015 to reboot and follow my dreams, dance, learn Spanish, and start RipCity Dance.</p>
<p>(RipCity is the nickname my coaches Elia and Brian gave me a few years back.  It stuck.)</p>
<p>As I integrated into the local dance community these past four years, I noted that while families definitely engage and grow together in many ways -- through sports, festivities, day-to-day, food, travel -- there are not a lot of opportunities for families to dance and move together, as families.  This is exciting new territory.</p>
<a name=""bullet3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h4>2015</h4>
<p>RipCity Dance incorporated in June 2015.  This past summer we developed our business plan and start-up structure, and begun engaging teachers, families and communities.  In September, we offered our first two classes:</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444502748/ewehujlfyyedxfol8awa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Family Funk</b>, an intro to breakdance and hip-hop for everyone six years old and up, taught by <a href=""http://www.eliamrak.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elia Mrak</a> at the Martin Luther King Jr. F.A.M.E.

<p><b>Floor Families</b>, a groovy modern dance and flow class geared for toddlers and kids in the 4-9 age range and their families.  Taught by <a href=""http://www.mattdrews.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Matt Drews</a>, the class was offered at a Seattle dance hub, <a href=""http://velocitydancecenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Velocity Dance Center</a>, in Capitol Hill.</p>
<a name=""bullet4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h4>2016 and beyond</h4>
<p>Our plans this fall and winter, and into 2016, are to continue engaging new teachers and producing new and continuing classes all around town.  Ultimately we'd like to open our own studio in a year or two.  Dream spots in Seattle for a studio include West Seattle and Georgetown.</p>
<p>Until then, to make the company strong and self-sufficient, we need to produce as many classes and workshops as we can.  Your donations will help us to engage teachers, find venues, and develop relationships and opportunities for classes and workshops with local schools and community centers.</p>
<p>Funds raised from this campaign will keep us moving on all these fronts in 2016.</p>
<a name=""bullet5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h4>The bottom line</h4>
<p>Our campaign goal is $10,000.</p>
<p>Right now we pay our teachers a class rate of $100/hour, which is about 25% above the general market rate.  I don't believe in artists being broke all the time -- they should be paid fairly for their skills.</p>
<p>Venue rents vary.  Promotions and marketing are costly and necessary.  The company has several ongoing base rates to pay -- for merchant services, web site hosting, accounting and banking.</p>
<p>Donations for this campaign will give us a strong operating budget for 2016, and produce more classes.  The more we do, the closer we will focus onto our business plan of ongoing classes and financial self-sufficiency in a home space in town.</p>
<p>What are the risks?  Like all young companies, the big risk is running out of funds before we become self-sufficient.  If you can help now, you are helping us to grow and thrive.</p>
<p>Costs will no doubt multiply once we have a home base.  That comes later, I imagine in the fall of 2016 or in 2017.  For those costs, we will likely be back with a directed campaign for venue start-up support.  The reality is we will start making money after we are established and in a studio.</p>
<p>Until then, building a teacher roster and a community of participating families and friends is where your donation dollars will be spent, helping us go where we need to go.</p>
<a name=""bullet7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><h4>Sharing is caring</h4>
<p>We understand if you cannot contribute funds.  The other big way to help is to share our campaign, with your social media networks on Facebook and Twitter, with your email networks of friends and colleagues, or good old fashioned face to face in coffee shops, gyms, bus stops, book stores, dance classes, community centers, schools, work, and home.</p>

Ed Valentine’s “Each to Each,” both of which will join a wonderful evening of
short plays at the Cobalt Café in Dublin, opening May 9, 2016!
""Julie Andrews is the Devil""
Now there’s a provocative title! What can it possibly mean? You’ll find
out when lesbian dycon folksinger Marissa crosses paths with Tabitha (formerly
Sister Ruth) on Commercial Street in Provincetown during Women’s Week.
· 
Directed by Ed Valentine
· 
Starring Andrea Alton & Virginia Baeta
""Each to Each""
Who hasn’t heard the mermaids
singing? Well Sister Ann, for one. The good sister, an older Irish nun, has
been assigned to be the keeper of the newly-captured mermaid Cyrene. Sister Ann
wants to hear the mermaid sing…Cyrene wants to return to the sea. Who will get
her way?
· 
Written & Directed by Ed Valentine
· 
Starring Virginia Baeta & Elizabeth A. Bell

<p><u><strong>WHY WE NEED YOU</strong></u></p>
<p>(We promise we haven’t spent all the money on hiring male escorts...)</p>
<p>We have been given a four-night run of FIVE CARD STUD at the Lantern Theatre as part of the Brighton Fringe Festival and have raised a significant amount of funding needed through investment and generous donations.</p>
<p>However, we do not have the facilities to hire out our team as one might ‘company’, so we still have a little more to raise! We want to ensure the production is the highest quality and reaches our identified audiences; to raise the profile of our talented artists and raise awareness of the three core themes in FIVE CARD STUD – preconceptions on gender and the LGBTQ community, stigma against sex workers, and the unspoken often crippling loneliness in the middle-aged.</p>
<p>The £1,600 we are asking you for will be paid towards the travel and accommodation of the team to and from Brighton, some design elements of the show and increasing our marketing materials to get press coverage and ensure reviewers attend the show, reach our target audiences and help with our long-term goal of an extended production.</p> <p><u><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></u></p>
<p>This play has been developed over a long period of time with a wealth of wonderful people and organisations, and it would mean the world to have your support in helping us finally present this play in the professional, full-length run it deserves.</p>
<p>In a time when sex is literally at our fingertips with modern social/dating/hook up apps, it seems to be becoming harder to find meaning when meeting someone. What is even more astounding though is the fact that sex can be had at the push of a button, yet there is still such a varied opinion on the issues we are addressing. Our research indicates that both older gay men and straight women alike find it difficult to embrace their sexuality in such a hands-on era, but even worse, they are judged for their actions when they do.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the stigma toward sex workers of both genders is palpable. To quote the play’s feature escort Ace, “It’s something everyone has an opinion yet doesn’t really know much about”. Charity National Ugly Mugs are fighting stigma and saving lives, providing greater access to justice and protection for sex workers who are often targeted by dangerous individuals, working to advocate the human rights of this discriminated group and keep them safe. We as a team fully support the work of this organisation and are honoured to be helping spread the word and raising awareness on their behalf.<br/> </p>
<p><strong><u>ABOUT THE PLAY</u></strong></p>
<p>For a male escort, if the clients are play nice, it  can be a pretty sweet deal. Problem is, Elliot doesn't always play nice…</p>
<p>Elliot was once the employer of marketing intern Alex. Alex has since gone on to become Ace, a male escort in high demand.  High above the city in a swanky flat, what service will the Five Card Stud be expected to perform when confronted by his past?</p>
<p>Join Ace and Elliot’s evening as it unfolds in two different ways; one where Elliot is an older male client, one where she is female. As the audience become silent voyeurs in the room at close quarters with the two couples, they are asked to consider what difference gender makes to the transaction; what can and cannot be said between the sexes when sex is on the table.</p> <p><u><strong>OUR SEXY TEAM</strong></u></p>

Our research indicates that both older gay men and straight women alike find it difficult to embrace their sexuality in such a hands-on era, but even worse, they are judged for their actions when they do.
Furthermore, the stigma toward sex workers of both genders is palpable. To quote the play’s feature escort Ace, “It’s something everyone has an opinion yet doesn’t really know much about”. Charity National Ugly Mugs are fighting stigma and saving lives, providing greater access to justice and protection for sex workers who are often targeted by dangerous individuals, working to advocate the human rights of this discriminated group and keep them safe. We as a team fully support the work of this organisation and are honoured to be helping spread the word and raising awareness on their behalf. 
ABOUT THE PLAY
For a male escort, if the clients are play nice, it  can be a pretty sweet deal. Problem is, Elliot doesn't always play nice…
Elliot was once the employer of marketing intern Alex. Alex has since gone on to become Ace, a male escort in high demand.  High above the city in a swanky flat, what service will the Five Card Stud be expected to perform when confronted by his past?
Join Ace and Elliot’s evening as it unfolds in two different ways; one where Elliot is an older male client, one where she is female. As the audience become silent voyeurs in the room at close quarters with the two couples, they are asked to consider what difference gender makes to the transaction; what can and cannot be said between the sexes when sex is on the table. OUR SEXY TEAM

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>Tartuffe, a wily con man who passes himself off as a pious puritan, has insinuated himself  into the household  of Orgon, a wealthy Parisian. The impostor has designs on his benefactor's fortune, and his attractive wife. Members of the family are exasperated, then outraged, by Tartuffe's malign influence, as he plots to gain control of Orgon's assets, disinherit his son, marry his daughter and take over his house – as well as his mind.</p>
<p>The script updates Moliere's language without losing his incisive wit. In this farcical face-off between love and greed, credulity and cynicism, we've added a framing device that parallels the crisis within the play, leading to a surprise climax.</p>
<p>The tuneful score, as you can hear in our two-minute video preview, likewise reflects both the play's period and our own. Listeners have likened it to <i>A Little Night Music </i>and <i>Candide.</i></p>
<h3>The Production</h3>
<p><i>Tar2f!</i> will premiere in April 2018 on Silverthorne Theater Company’s home stage in the Hawks &amp; Reed Performing Arts Center, Greenfield, Mass. The fully professional production (which means: everyone gets paid) will employ ten actor/singers, three or four musicians, an experienced creative team, and a skilled technical crew. We will draw from the deep pool of Valley-based pros, including members of Actors Equity.</p>
<p>The production won’t be lavish – we’re making economies wherever possible – but it won’t be cheap. Silverthorne’s usual production budget will cover less than half of this show’s costs. <u>That’s where you come in</u>. Your contribution, in whatever amount, will help us not only get <i>Tar2f!</i> on the boards, but mount it to the standard it deserves.</p>
<p>Exactly what will we do with your <u>tax-deductible</u> donation? We'll  pay our actors ($7,400) and musicians ($2,000). We'll hire a director, arranger, musical director, choreographer, technical director and stage manager ($5,300). We'll pay for rehearsal and performance space ($5,500). We'll build a set and create costumes ($1,260). We'll advertise ($1,000). We'll sell tickets and solicit sponsorships, but we need an additional <strong>$10,000</strong> to bring <i>Tar2f!</i> to life.  </p>
<h3>The Cast</h3>
<p>We haven’t quite finished casting, but here’s a sneak peek at the company so far. We're excited to be working with these talented artists:</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Route 66 Theatre Company is a storefront theatre that brings together high-quality production values and top Equity talent to perform World and Chicago premieres in intimate theatre setting. Route 66 is also the only theatre company in town that involves its patrons in their season selection process with its Driver’s Seat Monthly Reading Series. Founded in 2008, Route 66’s mission is to produce plays, concerts and musicals for the stage that embrace the American spirit of risk, exploration, and fearlessness.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>Since our inception, Route 66 has operated with the philosophy that producing shows of quality, with compelling stories and artists that can connect with audiences, is the most important thing. This means that sometimes, work we believe in and work that resonates with patrons doesn’t always make the front page, and we try our hardest to make up the difference in ticket sales with other fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>We are at a place where our fall show, A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY UNIT AT MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING CANCER CENTER OF NEW YORK CITY, <strong>needs an extra push to be produced</strong>. This dark comedy is poignant, engaging, and a story that we’re excited to tell, but it will be a taller mountain to climb without the help of our backers.</p>
<h3>Why your Help Matters:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Productions are expensive. In order to adequately pay our talented actors and production staff, we are looking to raise <strong>$5,000 </strong>for FUNNY THING. Why this show and why now?<ul>
<li><p>Tickets sales only cover a third of our costs - that's a lot of corners to cut!</p></li>
<li><p>Illinois budget cuts for the arts and arts funding means that projected funds for this show are not what we planned for - donations are imperative to make up this deficit.</p></li>
<li>
<p>We want to realize our commitments to our partners and this show, such as paying people on time, making good on other financial commitments. Your contribution ensures we can do that without making late payments. </p>
<p><strong>We need your money to make sure that happens.  Our show is opening soon and we want to secure a successful run.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supporters will receive <strong>special notes from the cast and crew</strong>, <strong>signed scripts</strong>, <strong>tickets to shows</strong>, and the opportunity to <strong>connect with our cast and director one on one</strong>. We want to produce this show because we are drawn to the story, to its raw exploration of human emotion and the way we connect with one another. As such, we will offer our supporters multiple opportunities to interact with us in real life!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>We believe in this show and its power, and are confident that ticket sales will reflect that. But to get to the point where we’re packing the house and sharing this story with more people than we could have hoped for, donor support is paramount to our success. Without this funding, we risk delayed payments to our artists, to our venue, and fewer shows - which means fewer chances to show this story to our city.</li></ul>

<h3>About Bump</h3>
<p>Lily is 23, young, free and single and waiting for her life to start, but she's hit a bump. Bump is a tale of some of the awkward encounters and nauseating moments that make up a girl’s life. Meet Lily and hear her story as she confronts her choices in the waiting room of an abortion clinic. <i>Bump </i>is a visceral and fast paced one-woman show exploring the journey of childhood to womanhood.</p>
<h3>Why Is It Important?</h3>
<p><strong>Abortion in Ireland is illegal</strong> unless it occurs as the result of a medical intervention performed to save the life of the mother. It is prohibited by both the constitutional protection of the right to life of the unborn and by legislation. <strong>Twelve women a day travel from Ireland to the UK</strong> to have an abortion. <i>Bump</i> presents the audience with the opportunity to hear the story of a woman who has decided to have an abortion. A woman who is from the UK. A woman who will not face any legal consequences for her decision. A woman who does not take this decision lightly. Bump introduces us to Lily as she openly relives with us all the awkward encounters that go along with growing up as a young girl, a teenager and a young adult. It is important to us to present Lily's story without the politics of an Irish setting and to give the audience this chance to get to know Lily and empathise with her position. <strong>Personal accounts are of vital importance within this debate. </strong>The reason so many Irish people are campaigning to repeal the eighth amendment is because they believe they deserve a choice. <strong><i>Bump</i> presents us with an unflinching personal account </strong>so that we, the audience, can see a detailed account of a person in this situation rather than a statistic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495114132/wrn0be6q1w2vtogmjp8v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Taking a show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival is a big financial risk. There are over <strong>3000 performances</strong> staged at the festival annually and we will be up against big competition to have our show seen and ensure Lily's story reaches as many people as possible. So why Edinburgh? We want to take Bump to an international stage to further highlight the debate that is currently happening in Ireland. We want to have this discussion, which is not a uniquely Irish one, but a global one, with a global audience. As well as attracting a huge number of shows, Edinburgh attracts the largest and <strong>most diverse audience of any Fringe Festival in the world</strong>, and that is where Lily's story belongs. Performing at the festival can also open up opportunities to <strong>tour our show internationall</strong>y, earn some <strong>development funding</strong> for the future, and of course, <strong>win awards! None of this is possible without every generous donation</strong>, however big or small.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>We need €8,000 to contribute towards a variety of costs</strong> that come along with our wonderful slot in the Assembly Festival. To date, <strong>we have fundraised</strong> to contribute to costs we have incurred at this stage in the production process and will continue to fundraise after this campaign too. The physical production values of the show are minimal as Bump is all about Lily, not about spectacle, and the show needs to travel easily and cost-effectively. An extra poster can equate to an extra ten lovely people (or ten nasty people, we'll take either) coming to enjoy our hard work and labour of love. The costs are broken down as follows..</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Venue Costs:</strong> We have been programmed by <strong><a href=""https://www.assemblyfestival.com/holding.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Assembly Festival</a></strong>, one of the big four venues at the Edinburgh Fringe, and we couldn't be happier! The Assembly Festival is famous for presenting the work of young emerging international artists every year. That must be us?! But of course the venue require a guarantee, insurance and some more stuff we won't bore you with in order to be able to programme such a fantastic festival.</li>
<li>
<strong>Accommodation: </strong>We (the cast and crew) will be residing in Edinburgh for the entire month of August and that costs a pretty Great British Pound plus all the pennies down the side of your couch.</li>
<li>
<strong>Travel:</strong> We gotta get there to put on the show! Boarding passes and bus tickets will be required to get us from Ireland to Edinburgh and on to conquering the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>Promotional &amp; Marketing Material: </strong>So, we've done steps 1, 2 and 3. We've made it to Edinburgh, dropped the stuff of at our flat, arrived at the venue and no-one's there to see the show. Nope. That simply won't do. If a tree falls in the wood and nobody hears it, did it really fall? Many smart academic-type people ask the same of theatre. If there is no audience, can you even call it theatre? We don't want to be on the other end of that question. <strong>Press assistance, flyers, posters, advertising and more are essential </strong>to make sure Bump is a hit.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We recognise that your donation is a charitable one but it is with insurmountable faith in our project that we have undertaken this journey and that is why we are asking you to join us, your support means so very much to the success of this production! Therefore, although we can't offer you millions if the show is a big hit (if it is, we will hopefully all arrive home in only a small amount of debt each), <strong>we can offer you some lovely perks</strong> to show you how much we care.</p>
<p>These include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>friendship</strong> like no other (check it out below).</li>
<li>Tickets to our upcoming <strong>super-secret fundraising party</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tickets to our previews</strong> in London and Dublin.</li>
<li>Home-made<strong> Pom Pom accessories</strong> by our very own performers (earrings, keyrings).</li>
<li>Lots of <strong>incredibly grateful mentions</strong> on our social media and any other opportunity we get to thank you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Regular updates</strong> on Bump as it develops and during production.</li>
<li>You could be<strong> Beyoncé. *</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*only as true as your imagination makes it.</p>
<p><strong>If we don't reach our entire goal,</strong> that would be unfortunate. However, <strong><a href=""https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/bump"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bump is currently being sold online at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival website</a></strong> so there is no turning back! The funds we gratefully accept from this campaign, if we are not successful in reaching our goal, will go mostly towards venue rental and accommodation as the most expensive elements of this travelling production. We will continue to fundraise and seek financial support elsewhere right up until when we land in Edinburgh to help contribute towards our other costs, and we will of course be saving and contributing our own money towards the production.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Performing a show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival is notoriously risky and comes rife with challenge after challenge. We've decided to do it as we believe we are prepared for this level of risk so let us make it clear.</p>
<p>We are at <strong>risk of running up personal debts</strong> while in Edinburgh, even if we make our campaign target and our other fundraising targets. If you google ""Putting On A Show at the Edinburgh Fringe"", we can guarantee that within three clicks, you'll have read at least three instances of people expressing, ""Even if your show sells out you could make a loss."" In fact, check out the <strong><a href=""https://www.edfringe.com/take-part/putting-on-a-show/budgeting-and-finance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fringe budgeting and finance guide</a></strong> here and you should find that information very quickly. So one can imagine how awry things might go if we arrive having not met this target!</p>
<p>The<strong> biggest challenges of the Fringe</strong> are getting people to come and see your show. ""Of course! There's loads of shows on! How will Bump stand out amongst thousands?"", you’re thinking and, ""Why? There are thousands of people there to see theatre and comedy? Surely they will want to see Bump?"". The thousands of artists there fight every day for peoples' attention on the Royal Mile and near to their venues to encourage someone to take a flyer and go buy a ticket for their show. For several hours each day, we will promote the show come Scottish rain, rain or rain (let's be honest, it'll mostly be rain) on the street. In between then, the show will be performed. After that, we'll mingle with other artists, attend their shows and do our best to convince them to come to ours. It never stops! Much like the rain. And despite that, we have no guarantee of a minimum amount of tickets we might sell, though we have a fairly good idea which brings us to..</p> <p>How are we going to surmount these risks and challenges? <strong>Meticulous budgeting</strong> and surviving solely on the consumption of bananas are our plans for overcoming these challenges. With a detailed and <strong>regularly updated budget</strong>, we can begin to <strong>quickly forecast ticket sales</strong>, identify immediately<strong> where we can cut costs</strong>, and all things going well, identify <strong>where our spending is most valuable</strong>. The bananas were a joke; staying healthy in body and in mind in Edinburgh is vital to our success. We'll need <strong>buckets of positive energy each day</strong> to get our show up onto the stage and to successfully promote it to anyone lucky enough to lock eyes with us on the street. Promotion and sales experience amongst the cast and crew are a big advantage to us.</p>
<p>Cumulatively, we have an extensive amount of <strong>experience in professional international festivals</strong>, performances, fundraising, budgeting, development, touring, theatre of all types and we have done as much research as we possibly can about what it takes to make Bump the hit we know it can be. We are <strong>well qualified</strong> to deal with anything that comes in our direction and we are, more importantly, ready for it.</p>

</div></div>","Who are we?
BUMP&GRIND are a recently established, Dublin-based theatre company who devise, produce and perform invigorating and provocative theatre. We met in UCD in the wonderful UCD Dramsoc where we first started working together. We are comprised of performers, makers, directors, producers and designers and Bump will be our first venture with a performance overseas. The crew behind Bump is made up of Rosa Bowden, Cathal Sheerin, Rosa Torr, Ailish Toal, Shane Gill and Kelley Gissane.

<p><br/>Listen, New York City has hundreds of one act festivals that deal with almost everything from short plays focused on social change or short plays designed for solo performances. But there is not one, NOT ONE festival where the focus is on the art of humor.  That is why Adam Chisnall and Yue Liu bring to you <strong>The One Act Comedy Fest </strong> at The PIT Loft. A festival where every work deals with comedy, the most glorious word in the English language (yeah, I kinda stole this saying from <i>42nd Street</i>). This festival gives a chance for new writers to showcase their humorous works to see just how many laughs a play may get!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The brains behind this fest is Adam Chisnall, a comedian and emcee residing in NYC. Adam has a BA in Musical Theatre from Point Park University and has studied with The Second City Chicago. Adam has been a part of the ""Hoboken Comedy Festival"" and has toured with ""Comedy's Best Kept Secret"". He has emcee'd at Caroline's, StandUp NY, New York Comedy Club, Broadway Comedy Club, Dark Horse Comedy Club, and Gotham. Adam has combined his love for comedy with his love of theatre therefore creating <strong>The One Act Comedy Fest</strong>. He has joined forces with producer Yue Liu, who is receiving her MFA in Theatre Management and Producing from Columbia University. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking to raise funds that will go to help paying our artists, rehearsal spaces, costumes, props... you understand why we need these generous donations. The idea for <strong>The One Act Comedy Fest</strong> is to have a stepping stone to eventually create, The Comedy Repertory Theatre of New York; a theatre company focused on, you guessed it, comedy! Please join us October 29 at The PIT Loft 2 &amp; 9pm for The One Act Comedy Fest. Tickets are $5 for matinee and $10 for evening. The evening will include these works from upcoming playwrights and composers:</p>

<h3>Who is Arcadian Broad?</h3>
<p>Hello everyone! I'm Arcadian Broad. I'm 21 years old and reside in Orlando FL. I'm a Dancer, Choreographer, Actor, Musician and Composer. I'm currently a Leading Dancer and Artist in Residence with the Orlando Ballet. </p>
<p>A little about myself so you're not talking to a complete stranger ;)</p>
<p>I started my ballet training at 15, which is rather late in the game. But I was always linked into the arts way before that. I started playing the piano at 2 years old, which i continue to play to this day. Music is where my artistic roots are which has allowed me to branch out into all the different facets that I'm involved in today. So it was quite appropriate that the first style of dance I  gravitated to was tap! I later started hip-hop as well. Did that for a couple years, eventually adding jazz to my list. At 12, I was a understudy for the role of Billy in the original broadway show of Billy Elliot. Then at 13 I auditioned for Season 4 of America's Got Talent. I danced my way to the Top 10!  After that, Ellen Degeneres invited me to perform on her show, which was pretty awesome! At 15 I attended the Juilliard School in NYC. That is where I started focusing on ballet, contemporary and choreography. A year later, Orlando Ballet's Artistic director Robert Hill hired me for the professional company. I'm the youngest dancer to be hired under him. During the past 5 seasons with company Ive had the opportunity to grow into Principal roles and choreographing for the company. I produced my first work at 16 and haven't stopped since! With an ever growing repertoire including successful pieces such as:</p>
<p>""Time""</p>
<p>""Pshycological Recovery""</p>
<p> ""White Noise""</p>
<p> ""MW2""</p>
<p> ""Seasons""</p>
<p>and ""An American in Paris Suite"". </p>
<p> I've also branched out into composition now. Most recently I choreographed and composed an original score for my first full length production ""Beauty &amp; the Beast"". </p>
<p>This campaign is to launch my project ""From A to B"". Which is a group where we'll perform my choreography. This will allow me to have the space to produce more work in both dance and music more efficiently. To experiment and grow to get one step closer to perfecting my craft. </p>
<p>I've always loved the idea of community. The ""It takes a village"" concept. Which it does! As much as this project is about me, it is also about the community! Cause without the audience coming to support my ideas and shows,,,there would be no growth of community. It is my great hope and intention that not only I will benefit by ""From A to B""s success but the community benefits as well! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p>So I'm going to level with you guys...</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of $15,000..then this won't happen. </p>
<p>Let me break down the expenses for you:</p>
<p>Venue Rental) </p>
<p>I'm shooting for the 300 seat venue Alexis and Jim Pugh Theater in Orlando, FL to kick off my project. That rental will range from 3k-5k.</p>
<p>Production Elements)</p>
<p>I've decided for the sake of budget, to stick with very minimalistic production elements in terms of drops and props. This will range from 2-4k.</p>
<p>Lighting)</p>
<p>It is essential to me to have a variety of options for lighting. It really elevates the scale of the production. This will range from 5-7k.</p>
<p>Paying the dancers)</p>
<p>The remaining budget would be for paying the dancers. Remember, these are professional dancers we're talking about here. You wouldn't ask a NFL player to join your team for free right?! Same thing here. Paying the artists is very important.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal... the funds that were raised will be set aside for the next campaign.  </p>
<p>Although, I am very confident that we will reach our goal! I know I can trust you guys!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks, Challenges &amp; Rewards</h3>
<p>Just like with anything in life there will be risks and challenges. I am starting this project from the ground up. Right now, it's just ideas and hard work behind this dream. With your contribution, you will help make this a reality! </p>

</div></div>","Who is Arcadian Broad?
Hello everyone! I'm Arcadian Broad. I'm 21 years old and reside in Orlando FL. I'm a Dancer, Choreographer, Actor, Musician and Composer. I'm currently a Leading Dancer and Artist in Residence with the Orlando Ballet. 
A little about myself so you're not talking to a complete stranger ;)
I started my ballet training at 15, which is rather late in the game. But I was always linked into the arts way before that. I started playing the piano at 2 years old, which i continue to play to this day. Music is where my artistic roots are which has allowed me to branch out into all the different facets that I'm involved in today. So it was quite appropriate that the first style of dance I  gravitated to was tap! I later started hip-hop as well. Did that for a couple years, eventually adding jazz to my list. At 12, I was a understudy for the role of Billy in the original broadway show of Billy Elliot. Then at 13 I auditioned for Season 4 of America's Got Talent. I danced my way to the Top 10!  After that, Ellen Degeneres invited me to perform on her show, which was pretty awesome! At 15 I attended the Juilliard School in NYC. That is where I started focusing on ballet, contemporary and choreography. A year later, Orlando Ballet's Artistic director Robert Hill hired me for the professional company. I'm the youngest dancer to be hired under him. During the past 5 seasons with company Ive had the opportunity to grow into Principal roles and choreographing for the company. I produced my first work at 16 and haven't stopped since! With an ever growing repertoire including successful pieces such as:
""Time""
""Pshycological Recovery""
 ""White Noise""
 ""MW2""
 ""Seasons""
and ""An American in Paris Suite"". 
 I've also branched out into composition now. Most recently I choreographed and composed an original score for my first full length production ""Beauty & the Beast"". 
This campaign is to launch my project ""From A to B"". Which is a group where we'll perform my choreography. This will allow me to have the space to produce more work in both dance and music more efficiently. To experiment and grow to get one step closer to perfecting my craft. 
I've always loved the idea of community. The ""It takes a village"" concept. Which it does! As much as this project is about me, it is also about the community! Cause without the audience coming to support my ideas and shows,,,there would be no growth of community. It is my great hope and intention that not only I will benefit by ""From A to B""s success but the community benefits as well! 

The Breakdown
So I'm going to level with you guys...
If we don't reach our goal of $15,000..then this won't happen. 
Let me break down the expenses for you:
Venue Rental) 
I'm shooting for the 300 seat venue Alexis and Jim Pugh Theater in Orlando, FL to kick off my project. That rental will range from 3k-5k.
Production Elements)
I've decided for the sake of budget, to stick with very minimalistic production elements in terms of drops and props. This will range from 2-4k.
Lighting)
It is essential to me to have a variety of options for lighting. It really elevates the scale of the production. This will range from 5-7k.
Paying the dancers)
The remaining budget would be for paying the dancers. Remember, these are professional dancers we're talking about here. You wouldn't ask a NFL player to join your team for free right?! Same thing here. Paying the artists is very important.
 
If we don't reach our goal... the funds that were raised will be set aside for the next campaign.  
Although, I am very confident that we will reach our goal! I know I can trust you guys!

Risks, Challenges & Rewards
Just like with anything in life there will be risks and challenges. I am starting this project from the ground up. Right now, it's just ideas and hard work behind this dream. With your contribution, you will help make this a reality! 
But with challenges...can come rewards... 
I have a few people who have watched my career throughout the years and really support me, offer to MATCH the funds we raise but only if we reach or surpass the $15,000 goal! 
Could you imagine... 15 turning into 30...
Then 30 to 45..
and 45 to 60! 
It all very exciting!

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute financially...you can still help!
By spreading the word amongst your circle of people and so on and so on to where it catches like wildfire! Sharing will help a lot! Share this on all your social media, email to friends and family etc. Remember, sharing is caring! ;) 
Thank you so much for sticking around and reading all about ""From A to B""! 
I hope that you decide to stand with me in making this dream a reality! 
Until next time folks!

<h3><strong>What is ONE Movement Project?  </strong></h3>
<p>Alex Abarca, Myra Bazell, Emily Christianson, and Bella Dorado (all Atlanta-based), Alicia Baskel (San Diego-based) and Lillian Ransijn (Philadelphia-based) are the brains, heart, and backbone of ONE movement project that started up in September 2016. </p>
<p>Together, we make up a collective of movement and theater artists, each with a unique background, perspective, and set of life experiences.  </p>
<p>Individually, we are each creating movement pieces based on our interpretation(s) of the word ""one"" through the lens of our personal stories, culture and pop culture, society, history, and politics. Once a month, we gather to share our work and give one another feedback in a supportive laboratory format.</p>
<p>Our year-long choreographic exchange will culminate in a series of live public performances, community movement workshops geared towards people with little to no formal dance training, and open discussion sessions in Atlanta, San Diego, and Philadelphia in Fall 2017 and Winter 2018. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<b>Our Goals</b><b>: </b>
</h3>
<p>We aim to:</p>
<p>- Examine our personal relationships with the multiple facets of ""one,"" in particular: feelings of isolation, singularity, unity, solitude, and inclusion using contemporary dance and theater as the vehicles;</p>
<p>- Unearth through movement and text the various ways that humans are interconnected in spite of their apparent external differences;</p>
<p>- Foster meaningful discussions about the significance of “one” and how dance as an art form can communicate this concept; </p>
<p>- Create and sustain an open, dynamic dialogue with the public</p>
<p>- Provide greater accessibility to contemporary dance to people who might not otherwise have the opportunity to be a part of it</p>
<p> </p>
<p>... we value artmaking that is meaningful, provocative and accessible and want to invite you to be a part of our journey! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How you can help:</strong></h3>
<p>We need to raise $20,000 to cover the costs of producing our premiere performance in Atlanta and touring our show to San Diego and Philadelphia. Theaters cost money to rent, flights cost money to book, and we need to pay the creative and production teams for their hard work and commitment! </p>
<p>By contributing towards ONE movement project, you will help pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artist fees for all six participating choreographers</li>
<li>Stipends for cast of 30-40 additional movers</li>
<li>Theater rental for performances in Atlanta, San Diego, and Philadelphia</li>
<li>Airfare and other travel-related expenses to and between Atlanta, San Diego, and Philadelphia</li>
<li>Production costs </li>

<h3><strong>Why we need your help:</strong></h3>
<p>Since we are a collective group of artists and not a nonprofit arts organization, we are limited with how we can raise money. We are not eligible to apply for most government and foundation grants, so our funding sources are limited. That's why we need your help! </p>
<p>Without making our fundraising goal, we will be extremely limited with where we can present our final performances in Atlanta. Also, touring the show to San Diego and Philadelphia will be financially difficult. We will have to operate on a shoestring budget that will not allow for the artists or production team to be paid their full stipends. We may not be able to compensate our cast of 30-40 additional performers for the final production. Finally, we are committed to offering one pay-what-you-can-performance to encourage audience participation across all economic levels. If we do not raise the necessary funds, we will not be able to offer reduced-price tickets to our final performance.</p>

<h3>Whalebone</h3>
<p><i>Whalebone</i> has been in development since we came back from Edinburgh last year. The initial seed was Nabokov’s unfinished novel, <i>Laura</i>, in which the protagonist deletes their body, imagining it invisible, simply because they can.</p>
<h3><strong>We found in this the potential to create a thought-provoking, complex, witty response to the issue of the objectification of women.</strong></h3>
<ul></ul>
<p>Our Laura, faced with the same external pressures experienced by the majority of women, decides to take back control by deleting her body altogether.  We are extremely excited to present the story of Laura, in an attempt to respond to a problem that plagues so many of the women we know. It’s irreverent, feminist theatre. It’s also narrated by a talking vagina, if that helps.</p>
<p>We are lucky enough to have secured a preview at Bunker Theatre in July, a slot at the Pleasance Courtyard in Edinburgh, and a one-off show at Pleasance Islington in October.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497280014/vomuj0mvqan3j3n2ixl5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><h3>However, as funding for small theatre companies becomes increasingly scarce, we are reliant on your support.</h3><ul></ul><div>
<p>We need to raise £2,000 to take <i>Whalebone</i> to Edinburgh. The money you donate will be spent on marketing, transport, and design elements of the show, as well as allowing us to pay for rehearsal space in the immediate run-up to the festival. If we achieve even more than our target, we will put money towards wages for everyone involved, as we really believe that in an idea world, everyone should get paid for what they produce.</p>

<p>We are hugely excited to bring this show to the biggest arts festival in the world, and to one of its most prestigious venues. Edinburgh is this show’s best chance of being seen by as wide and audience as possible, and enjoying a future life after the festival.</p>
<p>But more than that, Edinburgh is a platform for us as a new company, and we are so grateful for the spotlight that Pleasance is offering to us at the start of our career.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

However, we are confident that we will be able to engage people in the subject matter of our play, and really want to connect with as many people as possible about the issue of gender body politics, and introduce them to our puppet-led storytelling. As a small team, each of us is committing a huge amount of time, energy and (inevitably) personal funds, in order to give this show what it deserves. Any help you can give, however small, would make a difference!</p>

<h2>The White Bear</h2>
<p>From fresh new writing to unearthing lost classics, The White Bear Theatre is ""South London's new writing powerhouse"" - The Stage. </p>
<p>It exists to nurture talent, extend possibilities and offer a space where risks can be taken. The theatre has helped launch some of the country's most exiting theatre makers including Vicky Featherstone, Blanche McIntyre and Joe Penhall. Against a background of economic insecurity and Arts Council cuts, it supports emerging practitioners who want to develop their work and take their careers to the next stage, and for experienced artists to re-invent themselves. </p>
<p>Following extensive refurbishment of the entire White Bear building as well as a complete re-imagining of the theatre space, The White Bear is back with an exciting new programme of work that demonstrates its continued commitment to plays, engaging modern society in all its complexity.</p>
<p>We are ready to re-launch with a dynamic opening season bringing vital theatre to as wide an audience as possible. We are close, but need your help to get us over the line.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>We list our needs in order of priority. All funds received will be allocated according to priority.</p>
<h3>Let There Be Light!</h3>
<p>Donate to our new state of the art LED Lighting system: Zero88 LX Desk; Lights consist of Etc source 4, Fireball LED PAR and Zero88 alphapacks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> £1,500.</p>
<h3><strong>Full of Sound (with a side of fury...)</strong></h3>
<p>Donate towards our new, state of the art Sound system: Sound desk is Behringer; Amps and speakers are Crown and JBL.</p>
<p> £1,000.</p>
<h3>Are You Sitting Comfortably?</h3>
<p>Existing seating will be upholstered and covered with hard-wearing new fabric.</p>
<p> £500</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>So you like the look of the work the White Bear is doing and want to lend your support (great!). But the initial target has already been met (also great!) but now you feel you missed out (oh dear). Well... never fear! There is still more that we need help with! Any money we raise in excess of our initial target will go towards:</p>
<p>- <strong>Writers' Programm</strong><strong>e</strong>: The White Bear is establishing a Writers Programme that seeks to work with emerging playwrights to develop their work. We are committed to seeking out the country's future playwrights and working with them over a sustained period of time to nurture and develop their talents. We also will offer a platform for playwrights to meet and network with leading playwrights and practitioners in the industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","The White Bear
From fresh new writing to unearthing lost classics, The White Bear Theatre is ""South London's new writing powerhouse"" - The Stage. 
It exists to nurture talent, extend possibilities and offer a space where risks can be taken. The theatre has helped launch some of the country's most exiting theatre makers including Vicky Featherstone, Blanche McIntyre and Joe Penhall. Against a background of economic insecurity and Arts Council cuts, it supports emerging practitioners who want to develop their work and take their careers to the next stage, and for experienced artists to re-invent themselves. 
Following extensive refurbishment of the entire White Bear building as well as a complete re-imagining of the theatre space, The White Bear is back with an exciting new programme of work that demonstrates its continued commitment to plays, engaging modern society in all its complexity.
We are ready to re-launch with a dynamic opening season bringing vital theatre to as wide an audience as possible. We are close, but need your help to get us over the line.
 

What We Need
We list our needs in order of priority. All funds received will be allocated according to priority.
Let There Be Light!
Donate to our new state of the art LED Lighting system: Zero88 LX Desk; Lights consist of Etc source 4, Fireball LED PAR and Zero88 alphapacks.
 
 £1,500.
Full of Sound (with a side of fury...)
Donate towards our new, state of the art Sound system: Sound desk is Behringer; Amps and speakers are Crown and JBL.
 £1,000.
Are You Sitting Comfortably?
Existing seating will be upholstered and covered with hard-wearing new fabric.
 £500
Stretch Goals
So you like the look of the work the White Bear is doing and want to lend your support (great!). But the initial target has already been met (also great!) but now you feel you missed out (oh dear). Well... never fear! There is still more that we need help with! Any money we raise in excess of our initial target will go towards:
- Writers' Programme: The White Bear is establishing a Writers Programme that seeks to work with emerging playwrights to develop their work. We are committed to seeking out the country's future playwrights and working with them over a sustained period of time to nurture and develop their talents. We also will offer a platform for playwrights to meet and network with leading playwrights and practitioners in the industry.

The Impact
Crowd-funding is an important way of reaching out to you, as a way of inviting you to become an active and supportive member of the White Bear community. In doing so, you will ensure that fundamental technical equipment will be financed, without which we would be unable to reopen. Reaching our target will allow us to concentrate on exceeding the high standards of theatre the White Bear's audience has come to expect.

<h3>""Browncoats: The Musical"": A Firefly fan musical</h3>
<p>We were all heartbroken when Firefly was canceled. That day, a truly great piece of Sci-Fi was snuffed out far too soon. But the Firefly fandom has proven itself to be mightier than any network, and we've brought back out favorite smugglers in ""Serenity"" and in the comics.</p>
<p>We at Tea Time for Mad Girls Productions are avid Firefly fans. One day, as we were mourning the short run, we came upon an interesting thought. What would have happened if Joss Whedon had written a musical episode of Firefly, like Buffy The Vampire Slayer's ""Once More with Feeling""? We concluded that it would have been awesome. </p>
<p>So we took it upon ourselves, as fans, to write the musical episode of Firefly. </p>
<p>And Browncoats: The Musical was born. </p>
<p>And now we're bringing it to you for the first time, live onstage, in Brooklyn, NYC on May 6th! The crew you know and love is back, with a new plot, snappy dialogue, and a full score of original songs. </p>
<p>Come see what happened to the crew of Serenity after the events on Miranda, and enjoy Firefly in a whole new media! Tickets are available now at geminiandscorpio.com! But don't worry, Firefly fans who live far from New York City, there are ways for you to see Browncoats: The Musical too! (Spoiler Alert: we're filming it.)</p>
<p>Now we need your help to get Serenity flying again. With your contributions, we can bring back your favorite Sci-Fi show in a whole new way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need from you, and all the cool stuff we're offering:</h3>
<p>To paraphrase Terry Pratchett,  ""Theatre doesn't make money. You put money in and Theatre comes out."" And that is true of Browncoats: The Musical. And because all the proceeds from ticket sales are gong to be donated to the ACLU, we are relying on you to help us bring Browncoats: The Musical to life.</p>
<p>Below is a simple cost breakdown, giving you an idea of how much it can take to bring a story like Browncoats: The Musical to life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Production Costs<ul>
<li><p>Rehearsal Studio Spaces: $600</p></li>
<li><p>Set and Properties: $250</p></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p>TOTAL: $2,000</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That's where you come in. $2,000 is a lot of money for a small production company, but when you break that up among a thousand Firefly fans....it only costs $2 a fan to see your favorite story come back to life in a whole new media. Of course....you're probably going to want to give us more than $2...because we're not only bringing you an incredible Fan-Musical based on your favorite smugglers, we also have some incredible perks for you!</p>
<ul>
<li>A Browncoats: The Musical DVD: Good new for those of you outside the NYC area, we will be filming the first performance of Browncoats: The Musical so that you can all see it, no matter where you are from. Don't let distance stand in the way of you getting to be at the premiere of the ""shiniest"" musical ever! Just get the recording as either a physical DVD or a Digital Copy and watch Browncoats: The Musical over and over and over again...just like you watch Firefly and Serenity!</li>
<li>We had the fantastic Jennifer Drucker, graphic designer, put together a beautiful show poster and set of 9 character prints, inspired by Browncoats: The Musical to offer as perks for you here. (Check them out in the Photo Gallery) They're a beautiful and unique way to show your support for both Browncoats: The Musical, and the whole Firefly fandom!</li>

<h3>The Browncoat Cause: Why we're doing this as a benefit</h3>
<p>We're living in an interesting time. The world around us is heaving into turmoil. And as artists, we wanted to do our small part to help. As fans, we couldn't help but see ourselves in the Browncoats, who ""Picked the losing side, but still ain't convinced it was the wrong one."" So we made a story. A story about resistance. A story about moving forward. A story about learning to live when it seems like the whole world is upside down. </p>
<p>And we decided to perform that story while raising money for the American Civil Liberties Union, and organization that has promised to protect the rights of ALL Americans. We felt it was the best way for us to give back. </p>
<p>So help us.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary:</strong></p>
<p>My name is David Lind and I am actor, director, playwright and teacher. I am also survivor of childhood sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The merging of my “artist” self and “survivor” self resulted in my creating <i>FAITH – From Anger Into Trust &amp; Hope</i> - a show that explores the healing journey of a survivor of clergy sexual abuse.</p>
<p>By assisting me in producing this show, you will help me to...</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">...reach out to others who may have been abused and letting them know they are not alone.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">...encourage other survivors and victims to pursue healing paths and finding their voice.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">...help supporters, family and friends of survivors/victims better understand what the survivor/victim they know are going through.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>I am currently in the process of finishing the show and preparing to perform it at the 2017 Minnesota Fringe Festival. I have a performing slot at The Jungle Theater and am seeking funds to help pay for costumes, props, and set pieces; marketing and other promotional materials.</p>
<p>There are a variety of perks available to those who contribute ranging from being listed in the show's program and website to tickets to the show and opportunities to meet with me before or after the show to ask questions or discuss the issues of childhood sexual abuse or clergy sexual abuse or even how a show like this is created.</p>
<p>If the fund-raising exceeds the goal, any additional funds will be used to help promote bringing the show to other venues.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p>This show, while still in the creation stage, has already had an impact. There are survivors/victims who have reached out just from hearing that it is being created and expressed a desire to help out and share their stories, too.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>This is not your typical piece of theatre. The topic, while extremely topical, is a difficult one for many people to discuss. It's also a difficult journey to present to an audience. As Break The Silence's founder Sarah Super wrote:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“There is no easy way to be a survivor. If I only tell you about the pain, I fear I will perpetuate toxic stereotypes of the victim who is broken. But if I share with you only about my healing, I fear you will believe that time heals trauma, that healing is linear, and that I will minimize the damage of sexual assault.”</p>
<p>This show looks at both the initial impact of clergy sexual abuse as well as what it takes to heal.</p>
<p>Any assistance you provide will be greatly appreciated. And if you're not able to help financially, please come see the show and spread the word.</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

SUMMARYThe Court Martial of Almirante Montojo by Dennis Posadas is a Spanish American War historical drama similar to court room dramas like A Few Good Men and The Caine Mutiny. It was inspired by how Admiral George Dewey came to the defense of Spanish Almirante Patricio Montojo in a Madrid trial after the 1898 Battle of Manila Bay, as mentioned in Dewey's 1913 Scribner autobiography.
The play is available on Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072MTYRG2

<h3> </h3>
<h3>A Vision</h3>
<p><i>Echo &amp; Narcissus</i>, the new interdisciplinary ballet by Satellite Collective, will debut at Brooklyn Academy of Music on September 14th &amp; 15th. This work is being created and performed by 40 individuals, a massive undertaking for a company as small as Satellite Collective. <i>Echo &amp; Narcissus </i>consists of an original score, original choreography, a live orchestra, some of the best dancers in New York, exceptional visual art, film, lighting design, and stage tech. This will be the seventeenth major interdisciplinary work Satellite has produced since our founding, nine years ago.</p>
<p>As we’ve built this work over the past year, the project has received generous support from the likes of Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, New Music USA and Brooklyn Academy of Music. But to get us to opening night, we’ll need our friends, family, and community to show their enthusiasm for and dedication to this ambitious endeavor.</p>

<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p>Echo &amp; Narcissus repurproses a 4000-year-old myth for the current turbulence of our own political moment. Grappling with themes of love, madness, selfishness, and transformation, Echo &amp; Narcissus asks if we have the will to wrench ourselves away from the intoxication of our own reflection. With an original score, original choreography, original animation, a live orchestra, some of the best dancers in New York, and a top tier production team; the ambition of this work is matched only by the deftness of our fierce little crew. But we can’t do it without your help.</p>

This is their seventeenth major work with the company.</p>

Following his career as a dancer at New York City Ballet, he was admitted to The Juilliard School, where he earned a Master of Music in composition and won the Juilliard Composers’ Orchestra Competition. Aaron has composed original scores for <a href=""https://youtu.be/PZtBzyY9eXk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the New York City Ballet</a>, the Pacific Northwest Ballet School, The Juilliard School, and the New York Choreographic Institute. </p>

<p>‘<b>Yes! Shakespeare</b>’ will involve a cast of 20-25 Guelph performers.  The primary setting of the play is a high school classroom making the majority of the cast teenagers.  There are parents, and teachers, and King Lears who will be played by adults.

<p>Tanagra Collective debuts new play about Dr. Henry Howard Holmes: the first modern Serial Killer!</p>
<p>We at Tanagra are proud to announce that Julian R. Munds’ new play, The Good Doctor Holmes &amp; His Children of God will be premiering at the Theatre Passe Muraille Backspace, May 11 -21, 2017. But before we can get to opening night we need your help.</p>

<p>Theatre, even good theatre, in Toronto costs a lot of money to present. There’s costs for rental of the performance space, rental of rehearsal space, costuming and set building. That’s just the bare minimum. What happens if these artists get injured? Sick? Hungry? Where’s the money to protect them in their hour of need? This is why we at Tanagra come to you. We need your help.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons for high ticket prices in Toronto is the large overhead costs get passed on to the consumer. We at Tanagra know our show will be a hit. It’s exciting. Hilarious. Haunting. But we don’t want to share it with you at an exorbitant price. Therefore, if you have some money to toss our way we will use it in the most efficient way. Just 20 dollars could get us one hour of rehearsal time or 10% of safety insurance.</p>
<p>We are want to raise 3000 in the next month so that we can cover insurance costs and rehearsal space costs. Every little bit helps.</p>
<p>Tanagra was founded by Julian R. Munds, award winning actor, director, and sometimes historian to create vibrant work and challenging art for Canadians. Theatre has been relegated in Canada for a myriad of reasons. Julian and Tanagra wish to restore the thrill of new work and leave an impact on the minds of the people that sit in the audience.</p>

<p>""The Good Doctor Holmes..."" has been a script that has floated around for three years now. It borrows from research into criminal psychology from the Quantico Bahavioral Archive in the US, actual contemporary accounts of the ""Pitezel Case,"" in Toronto courts and papers, and modern perspectives from the actors creating the characters.</p>
<p>The subject matter that we are dealing with is difficult but it is not foreign. HH was man who used systemic problems for personal gain. He was a doctor and often held his knowledge over less advantaged people to confuse and gain results for himself. We see this all the time now in political and cultural debates. Although the events depicted took play in the 1890s they feel like they could have been ripped out of the news of today.</p>

Our upcoming play is a fully immersive theatrical experience which showcases the work of Clarice Lispector's, Brazil's most acclaimed female writer. Our vision is to create a sensory play that serves as an entry point to Clarice's incredible --yet still mostly unknown in the US-- work.</p><p> </p><h3>INTRO</h3><p>Clarice Lispector (1920-1977) is Brazil's most acclaimed female writer. She was described  by researchers such as Iba Mendes and Benjamin Moser as the most important Jewish writer since Franz Kafka, with her trademark stream-of-consciousness writing style often being compared to that of Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. In fact, Clarice's Complete Stories was recognized among the best books of 2015 by the New York Times and the Boston Globe.</p><p>The underlying thread across Lispector’s work is the questioning of oneself and humanity. Her work is universal, transcending ethnicity, race, religion, time, gender and place. Many people say, and we agree, that you don’t just read Clarice, you experience it.</p><p>We believe that Clarice's amazing talent deserves to be shared beyond just Brazil. In a place as diverse and fast-paced as New York City, people deserve to have their hearts and minds touched by Clarice's incredible world view. This is how Inside the Wild Heart was born, an immersive theatrical experience to transport audiences directly inside Clarice Lispector’s heart, performed by the only Brazilian Theater Company in NYC.</p><p>Clarice used to say that ""all the world began with a yes."" And to turn Inside the Wild Heart into reality we need you to say ""yes"" too. Support us in making it happen! Your ""yes"" will be your key into the wonders of Clarice's heart.</p><p> </p><h3>ABOUT THE PLAY​</h3><p>INSIDE THE WILD HEART will be a site-specific, fully immersive and participatory theatrical experience. The performance will happen in a house setting where the audience will be able to walk freely from room to room following the performers and interacting with the environment​. Our vision is to create a show that encourages audiences to be active participants rather than passive spectators, and engage with literature on a sensorial level.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>ABOUT GROUP.BR</strong></h3><p>We are a group of Brazilian artists who live in New York. As the only Brazilian Theater Company in the city, our mission is to bring Brazilian culture to New York stages through the performing arts. We use physical theater --where body movement is a form of communication-- as our main tool to expose the works of most renowned Brazilian artists. We provide audiences with a deeper, more nuanced exploration of Brazilian culture, beyond the familiar depictions of the country, as well as the unique opportunity to enjoy Brazilian dramaturgy and the musicality of the Portuguese language.</p><h3> </h3><p><strong>Where/ Onde</strong></p><p>Immersive Gallery - Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p><p><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">When</strong></p><p>November 3rd to 20th</p><p><strong>Where does the money goes</strong></p><p>.Venue rental, rehearsals</p><p>.Costume and set</p><p>.Copyright </p><p>.Marketing</p><p>.All the artists and other professionals committed with the project</p><p>Our real budget is U$60,000.00 but we want to be realistic about this campaign.

O teatro físico - onde o movimento do corpo é uma forma de comunicação - é a nossa principal ferramenta para expor os trabalhos dos artistas mais renomados do Brasil. Nossas peças são realizadas em Português com legendas em inglês. Nós fornecemos ao público de NY uma vivência mais profunda, com mais nuances da cultura brasileira, bem como a oportunidade única de desfrutar da dramaturgia brasileira ainda desconhecida e a musicalidade da língua Português.</p><h3><font><font>SOBRE A PEÇA</font></font></h3><p>Dentro do coração selvagem é uma experiência teatral site-specific totalmente envolvente e participativa, que transporta o público diretamente dentro do coração de Clarice Lispector. Essa experiência é vivida em um local que remete a uma casa, onde o público pode livremente andar de sala em sala seguindo os artistas e interagir com o ambiente. Cada quarto é uma instalação de arte inspirada por um elemento forte na escrita de Clarice.</p><p>Nossa visão é criar uma experiência sensorial que estimula o público a ser participante ativo, em vez de espectadores passivos, e se envolver com a literatura em um nível sensorial. O show, criado por Andressa Furletti e Debora Balardini e dirigido por Regina Miranda, integra artes visuais, cinema, música e arte performática para encarnar os sentimentos mais profundos da escritora. Dentro do Coração Selvagem segue linhas de produções teatrais performáticas de sucesso em NY, como Then She fell, Queen of the Night e Sleep no More.</p><h3>PORQUÊ AJUDAR?</h3><p>Clarice Lispector (1920 - 1977) é uma das mais importantes figuras literárias do Brasil. Ela, que já foi descrita como a mais importante escritora judia desde Franz Kafka, nasceu na Ucrânia e emigrou para o Brasil ainda criança, após a devastação da Primeira Guerra Mundial. Seu fluxo de consciência marca seu estilo de escrita, sendo muitas vezes comparada com a Virginia Woolf e James Joyce. Lispector é, infelizmente, relativamente desconhecida fora do Brasil. Com a recente tradução e publicação de seus contos completos e outros trabalhos selecionados, bem como a sua biografia, pelo autor Benjamin Moser, ela está ganhando apreço e reconhecimento dentro do universo literário da América. Na verdade, “Clarice – Contos Completos” foi reconhecido na lista do New York Times de livros notáveis de 2015, o canadense National Post o colocou na lista dos melhores livros do ano, Melhores Livros de 2015 pelo Boston Globe, e na lista dos 24 Melhores Livros de ficção de 2015 do BuzzFeed Books. O condutor de toda a obra de Lispector é o questionamento de si mesma e da humanidade. Sua obra é universal, transcendendo etnia, raça, religião, tempo, sexo e local. Muitas pessoas dizem, e nós concordamos, que você lê Clarice, você a experimenta. Esta experiência visceral de seu trabalho foi a inspiração para a concepção da performance imersiva Dentro do Coração Selvagem.</p><p><strong>O que esperar</strong></p><p>Uma experiência teatral site-specific totalmente envolvente e participativa, que transporta o público diretamente para dentro do coração de Clarice Lispector.</p><p><strong>Where/ Onde</strong></p><p>Immersive Gallery - Williamsburg, Brooklyn</p><p><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">When/Quando</strong></p><p>November 3rd to 20th / de 03 a 20 de Novembro de 2016</p><p><strong>Where does the money goes/Para onde vai o dinheiro:</strong></p><p>.Rehearsals and theatre / Espaço de ensaio e teatro</p><p>.Costume and set / Figurino e cenário</p><p>.Copyright / Direitos autorais</p><p>.Marketing</p><p>.To pay all the artists and other professionals committed with the project /Compensar o tempo e o talento dos artistas envolvidos</p><p> </p><p>Our real budget is U$60,000.00 but we want to be realistic about this campaign.

Mas antes da pré-história havia a pré-história da pré-história e havia o nunca e havia o sim.”(Clarice Lispector – A Hora da Estrela) Você diz “sim” para Clarice Lispector?Você diz “sim” para o teatro brasileiro em NY?Você diz “sim” para apresentar a cultura brasileira em NY através das arte cênicas?Você diz “sim” para o Group .BR?Você diz “sim” para uma experiência teatral imersiva baseada na obra de Clarice Lispector?O quê você diz?Alguns artistas incríveis disseram “yes” para este projeto e ofereceram suas obras como recompensa para quem disser “sim”.Sim?GROUP .BRA MISSÃO DO GRUPO .BR é trazer a cultura brasileira para NY através das artes cênicas. O teatro físico - onde o movimento do corpo é uma forma de comunicação - é a nossa principal ferramenta para expor os trabalhos dos artistas mais renomados do Brasil. Nossas peças são realizadas em Português com legendas em inglês. Nós fornecemos ao público de NY uma vivência mais profunda, com mais nuances da cultura brasileira, bem como a oportunidade única de desfrutar da dramaturgia brasileira ainda desconhecida e a musicalidade da língua Português.SOBRE A PEÇADentro do coração selvagem é uma experiência teatral site-specific totalmente envolvente e participativa, que transporta o público diretamente dentro do coração de Clarice Lispector. Essa experiência é vivida em um local que remete a uma casa, onde o público pode livremente andar de sala em sala seguindo os artistas e interagir com o ambiente. Cada quarto é uma instalação de arte inspirada por um elemento forte na escrita de Clarice.Nossa visão é criar uma experiência sensorial que estimula o público a ser participante ativo, em vez de espectadores passivos, e se envolver com a literatura em um nível sensorial. O show, criado por Andressa Furletti e Debora Balardini e dirigido por Regina Miranda, integra artes visuais, cinema, música e arte performática para encarnar os sentimentos mais profundos da escritora. Dentro do Coração Selvagem segue linhas de produções teatrais performáticas de sucesso em NY, como Then She fell, Queen of the Night e Sleep no More.PORQUÊ AJUDAR?Clarice Lispector (1920 - 1977) é uma das mais importantes figuras literárias do Brasil. Ela, que já foi descrita como a mais importante escritora judia desde Franz Kafka, nasceu na Ucrânia e emigrou para o Brasil ainda criança, após a devastação da Primeira Guerra Mundial. Seu fluxo de consciência marca seu estilo de escrita, sendo muitas vezes comparada com a Virginia Woolf e James Joyce. Lispector é, infelizmente, relativamente desconhecida fora do Brasil. Com a recente tradução e publicação de seus contos completos e outros trabalhos selecionados, bem como a sua biografia, pelo autor Benjamin Moser, ela está ganhando apreço e reconhecimento dentro do universo literário da América. Na verdade, “Clarice – Contos Completos” foi reconhecido na lista do New York Times de livros notáveis de 2015, o canadense National Post o colocou na lista dos melhores livros do ano, Melhores Livros de 2015 pelo Boston Globe, e na lista dos 24 Melhores Livros de ficção de 2015 do BuzzFeed Books. O condutor de toda a obra de Lispector é o questionamento de si mesma e da humanidade. Sua obra é universal, transcendendo etnia, raça, religião, tempo, sexo e local. Muitas pessoas dizem, e nós concordamos, que você lê Clarice, você a experimenta. Esta experiência visceral de seu trabalho foi a inspiração para a concepção da performance imersiva Dentro do Coração Selvagem.O que esperarUma experiência teatral site-specific totalmente envolvente e participativa, que transporta o público diretamente para dentro do coração de Clarice Lispector.Where/ OndeImmersive Gallery - Williamsburg, BrooklynWhen/QuandoNovember 3rd to 20th / de 03 a 20 de Novembro de 2016Where does the money goes/Para onde vai o dinheiro:.Rehearsals and theatre / Espaço de ensaio e teatro.Costume and set / Figurino e cenário.Copyright / Direitos autorais.Marketing.To pay all the artists and other professionals committed with the project /Compensar o tempo e o talento dos artistas envolvidos Our real budget is U$60,000.00 but we want to be realistic about this campaign.

<h3><strong>""So, What's It About?"" </strong></h3>
<p>Set in the 1920's, Thirst is about three people trapped on a raft in the middle of the ocean after the ship they were on sinks.  With a small amount of tweaking, we want to make the play feel relevant to a modern audience. Our Director is inspired by the work of Alexander McQueen, Andy Warhol and Stanley Kubrick, and with a talented production team with an eclectic mix of experience, we hope to bring you this story of survival, violence and human contact with a unique visual style.  It's a little bit weird, and a whole lot of wonderful!   </p>
<h3><strong>""Ok, So What Exactly Is The Project?""</strong></h3>
<p>Our project consists of a 2 week professional run of Thirst at the Space theatre on the Isle of Dogs, South-East London from the 28th February - 11th March 2017. </p>
<p>Running parallel to this, the Director will run a series of workshops which will be held at schools in the local community, in order to widen pupil’s engagement with abstract/expressionist theatre.  This will also equip them with new skills in theatre making.</p>
<p>A debate will be held at the Young Vic on the relationship between ‘art, race and theatre-making, does it matter who is on the driving seat?’.</p>
<h3><strong>""Great! What Do You Need?""</strong></h3>
<p>We need £1000 in order to afford:</p>
<p>Costume and props for our beloved actors.  We want the play to feel as authentic as possible, and we are sure they would be grateful to be clothed during the production! </p>
<p>A Lighting Designer.  We feel that light has a very important part to play in the production in order to give it the perfect atmosphere.  How will you know what is happening if it is in the dark! </p>
<p>A Producer.  We want the play to reach the ears of as many people as possible, and a marketing whizz is the perfect person to do this!  </p>
<p>And lastly, Rehearsal Space!</p>
<p>This money will also help us cover any admin costs we will come up against </p>
<h3><strong>""But What's In It For us?""</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from being able to brag to your friends about how you are supporting the arts and careers of emerging theatre makers in this country?  Well take a look at our rewards on the right hand side of the page! We think they are pretty nifty!</p>
<h3><strong>""Sorry, I Just Can't Contribute At This Moment In Time""</strong></h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can donate, but if you still want to support the project in some way, then we would love it if you could share this page on Facebook, Twitter, hell even Snapchat! Lets spread the word! </p>

<p>The <strong>HOME</strong> team are Dublin-based artists collaborating with the New Theatre, Temple Bar and with dramaturgical support from the Arts Council, Ireland. <strong>HOME</strong> was first presented during the Scene + Heard Festival 2017 as a work in progress and was warmly accepted by the audience, who's post-shows debates extended long into the night after the performance had finished. </p>
<p><strong>HOME</strong> will be performed at the New Theatre from January 22nd - February 3rd 2018. The play tackles important and hyper-relevant topics with a focus on the grey areas of consent and abortion rights in the legal system. </p>
<p>The best thing about <strong>HOME</strong>? <strong>You get to decide Anna's fate.</strong> The audience hold the power in this four-hander, acting as jury for Anna's trial. Love a chance to practise voting? The ending of <strong>HOME</strong> is in your hands. The script will present to you both sides of the story, including facts on how a case like Anna's works in Ireland, and it's up to you to decide. </p>
<p>There are quite a few costs that come alongside presenting a play for two weeks, including <strong>set, lighting, costume, marketing</strong> and <strong>administration costs</strong>. While we are a frugal bunch, well used to borrowing and making do or making cuts wherever we can, we still need to raise some money to support <strong>HOME</strong> on it's journey. Every penny of any donation, big or small, will be going towards our production costs, as listed above, and we have plenty of lovely perks for all of our generous supporters!</p>
<p>If you want to get to know the team behind <strong>HOME </strong>a little better, you can find our bios (plus lovely pics) below. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Oh, you're still here. Great! So what is it that we need? And what for?</p>
<p>We are campaigning to raise €3,000 to stage <strong>HOME </strong>in January/February 2018.</p>
<ol>
<li>Approximately one third of this will go into <strong>venue</strong> and <strong>insurance costs</strong>.</li>
<li>A little more than a third will be going into our <strong>set, lighting, costumes</strong> and <strong>props</strong>.</li>
<li>The remainder will go towards <strong>printing </strong>(posters, flyers, programmes), <strong>advertising, online content production</strong> (video, press photography, promotional photography) and <strong>administrative costs</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Donations of <strong>any size really do</strong> go a long way. A <strong>€5 donation</strong> can buy us around<strong> 50 flyers</strong>, for example! Those 50 flyers will be helping us spread the word about <strong>HOME </strong>so that as many people as possible can enjoy the show.</p>
<p>And what do I get in return, says you? Well, not to worry! It being the festive season, we have plenty of generous perks for you to avail of! Our funders can choose from..</p>
<ul>
<li>Tickets to see <strong>HOME! </strong>come and see the show in its full glory. Take matters into your own hands and vote on Anna's fate.</li>
<li>A personalised poster signed by the cast and crew to remember your contribution by.</li>
<li>We will name a character in the play after you. Seriously. This one goes to the very generous contributions. </li>
<li>Are you contributing on behalf of a business or company? You will get free advertisement space in our programme, which will be free of charge to all who come to see <strong>HOME</strong>.</li>
<li>Our endless thanks - this one goes without saying!</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't achieve our target of €3,000, we will do our best to raise the difference by other means such as a fundraising event. If we still fall short of our goal, we will need to cut our expenditure on marketing and production, which means our outreach and audience attraction will be lower, and our design and aesthetic for the show more limited.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>HOME</strong> was inspired by the urge to explore what consent means in regard to Irish law, and the legal risk associated with seeking an abortion in Ireland. The audience for <strong>HOME </strong>are given a unique opportunity wherein they are presented with arguments from both sides in relation to the consent and abortion trial they act as jury for. The court-room scenes are interspersed with flashback scenes, giving them a further insight into how the events of the night in question played out, and where they stand. </p>
<p>We believe that after watching <strong>HOME</strong>, the audience will leave with much more knowledge around the laws surrounding consent and abortion in Ireland. This is a topical show emerging onto the scene at a time when there is confusion and a constant reference to ""grey areas"". HOME will peak and satisfy peoples' need to know more on these topics.</p>
<p>Playwright, Megan O'Malley has had dramaturgical support from the Arts Council and the New Theatre in the final drafts of this play.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are a number of risks and challenges we may come across during our campaign and as we move into rehearsal for the show. However, the <strong>HOME</strong> team each have experience working professionally in theatre, and therefore we are confident that pooling our experience, talent and resources will result in a really powerful show. We are risking running up personal debts if we don't meet our target. <strong>HOME </strong>will be performed in early 2018, whether we meet our campaign goal or not. </p>
<p>How will we surmount this challenge if faced with it? Buckets of positive energy never go amiss because the show must go on at the end of the day (it's the night). Meticulous budgeting is vital to the success of a production of this scale, researching several pricing options for anything that needs to be purchased (as opposed to borrowed, rented or homemade), and running a strong marketing campaign with good images, video and press in advance of the performances. These elements being rock-solid will help us to overcome<strong> </strong>the risks and challenges we may face.</p>
<p><strong>HOME</strong> is an important piece of new Irish theatre, and we hope that you can contribute to it!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In a once-prosperous town left ravaged by never ending war, a nineteen year-old girl is on trial. She has reopened a long conflict, and lit a fire under the rebel cause. The government has at last caught up with her, and the punishment they seek is death. But there are complications. The girl refuses to tell the truth. She urges her judges to think of their souls. She says God will punish them if they hurt her. The girl is her own, and only, lawyer. She is surrounded by educated men who will use any means to find the legal loophole which makes the most convenient noose. The girl is a warrior, a martyr, a witch. The girl is Joan of Arc.</p>
<p>Playwright Alexandra Ranieri and director Iris Sowlat were chosen to bring this fresh re-telling of Joan of Arc's story to RhinoFest in Chicago this January. RhinoFest is Chicago's oldest fringe festival, and brings several well-curated full productions of world premiere plays to life every January.  </p>
<p>The artistic team is on their own to produce this play, under the umbrella of their new company, Abaissés Theatre, whose name is taken from a group of scrappy, intellectual French Revolutionaries, Les Amis de l'Abaissé (""friends of the abased""), and literally means ""Theatre for the abased"" or ""Theatre for the underdogs.""  </p>
<p>Our largest production expense will be compensating all of this production's artists fairly. Director Iris Sowlat values the creativity, time, and labor of other artists, above anything else, and wants to make sure that our team receives stipends comparable to other small non-Equity theatre companies. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to raise $1,000, for the following artist payroll breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>$450 total for a cast of 9 actors </li>
<li>$100 for a stage-manager</li>
<li>$100 for a fight choreographer</li>
<li>$320 for a team of four production designers (costumes, lighting, projections. sound)</li>
<li>$30 for a graphic designer </li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange for helping us compensate our team for their time and talent, some of the perks you could receive include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A signed, handwritten note from the playwright</li>
<li>Your name listed on social media and the play program </li>
<li>Coffee or drinks with the playwright and director</li>
<li>Dinner and drinks with the cast and crew</li>
<li>Complimentary tickets to the play </li>
<li>A custom poem written for you, by Alexandra Ranieri</li>
<li>A signed poetry book by Alexandra Ranieri</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will have the following impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every dollar from this campaign will be used to compensate actors, designers, a certified fight choreographer, and a stage manager for their work on <i>Joan of Arc. </i>
</li>
<li>This production will help bring an important and timely story- see through a fresh lens- to the stage. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing DIY theatre always involves risks. Fortunately, the Chicago theatre community is built for young, DIY companies such as this one. Additionally, Iris Sowlat has previous experience producing and directing self-produced works, including two full productions for the Chicago Fringe Festival, and multiple shows, cabarets, happenings, and events for Pride Arts Center, NoPassport Theatre Alliance, Theatre Without Borders, and the Chicago Women's History Council, to name a few. She has also directed plays, readings, and festival pieces for Broken Nose Theatre, the Chicago Theatre Marathon, Collaboraction, and 20% Theatre. </p>
<p>For this project, paying our artists is the only large expense. RhinoFest provides performances space for the show's 5-week run completely free of charge, with built-in tech time in the space, and built-in marketing through the festival. We have secured nearly-free rehearsal space, and we have connections to borrow props and costume pieces for nearly no cost. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute at the moment, other ways to help our show and our artists include:</p>

<h2><strong>The Story</strong></h2>
<p>In 2016, MCIF was created by improvisers Eva Gilliam (USA/SA) and Ashley Comeau (CAN), and hosted by local Cape Town troupe The Long Shots.</p>
<p>Both Eva and Ashley saw a gap in the South African Improv Comedy community, South African improvisors are desperate to grow their small community and spread the improv love as well as build on their own improv knowledge and education. Instead of South African Improvisors spending huge amounts of money to travel overseas to get improv training and exposure, Eva and Ash thought it would be better to bring the teachers and players to them... and so MCIF was born!</p>
<p><strong>A bit about Eva and Ashley:</strong></p>
<p>Eva (The Long Shots) hails from New York, USA who moved to South Africa 15 years ago. She is an improvisor, filmmaker, and multi-media consultant based in Cape Town and working across the African continent. Ashley (Lusty Mannequins) is an actor/improviser, producer, writer and instructor based out of Toronto, Canada. In 2015 she was named Toronto's Best Female Improviser by Now Magazine's ""Best Of"" Awards. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What is improv?</strong></h3>
<p>Improvisation, or improv, is a form of live theatre made up in the moment, without use of an already prepared, written script. It is an exciting and vibrant live performance where the audience and performers interact to make spontaneous and hilarious theatre on the spot. </p>
<p>As much as improv is a great tool to use in comedy and performance, it isn't just for performers. Improvisation tools and techniques extend way beyond the stage and can be used in businesses, schools or communities to promote communication, confidence, collaboration, trust, problem solving, leadership and creativity.</p>
<p>In essence learning and playing improvisation creates a community of people who think outside the box, can create something from nothing, and love to laugh. It crosses social and economic lines, bringing people of all backgrounds into a playful environment – it’s a no-brainer for social cohesion through laughter and play. Now, wouldn’t you love to be a part of that?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What happens at MCIF?</strong></h3>
<p>Courses all day, shows all night... Over the course of the 5-day festival we'll have short and longer intensive courses for beginners to advanced hosted by some of the world's most experienced and talented improvisors. When the sun sets, we'll have a line of up local and international teams perform some of the freshest and funniest improv comedy to hit African shores.</p>
<p>Last year we had 7 troupes perform and were over 90% sold out across all our shows. This year we are aiming to have at least 10 troupes, local and international. Our applications to performers have already opened and we are set to have some amazing talent grace our stages! We'll also have mixed teams for individual festival participants who don't have a team.</p>
<p>Every night closes with an open jam where all are welcome (players and audience) to jump up on stage together and try out some fun improv games devised and hosted by an MCIF improviser.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need...</h3>
<p>Our biggest and most important cost is getting our 5 international teachers over to South Africa. This year our teachers list includes some of the world's finest improvisors: Ashley Comeau (CAN), Connor Thompson (CAN), Alastair Forbes (CAN), Stefan Pagels Andersen (DEN) and one more special guest from Europe/USA still to be confirmed. They will be hosting various improv workshops, from beginner to advanced as well as showcasing their talents in the evenings at our shows alongside other local and international performers.</p>
<p>South Africa is far way away from the rest of the world and it cost a pretty penny to get here. 1 flight from Canada to South Africa costs around $1 250, yikes! The  total $7 500 Travel costs include: Flights, accommodation and daily subsistence allowance... anything left over from that will go to paying our teachers as salary (That's right, our amazing teachers have very generously agreed to not take a salary if the funds aren't available!).</p>
<p>The remaining $2 500 goes to venue hire, lighting and sound hire as well as promotional costs - to spread the word about the fest and the public involved!</p>
<p>All of the proceeds of the festival go back into the MCIF fund for 2018 and also helps to pay for all the awesome people involved - teachers, producers, photographers, graphic designers and taking care of our MCIF volunteers during the festival.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What you get...</strong></h3>
<p>We want you to get as excited about MCIF as we are so we have included some awesome perks. From social media shout outs, show and workshop tickets to kick ass swag bags which include t-shirts, notebooks and stickers. It's a great way to get your hands on some early bird tickets to the festival at great prices!</p>
<p>We understand that some of our backers won't be able to attend the festival so will have no use for the show and workshop tickets. No problemo! You can spread the improv love by donating your tickets to our raffle jar. Leading up to the festival various lucky draws will be held and festival goers will stand a chance to win your tickets - this way you get to support someone's improv dream to take a workshop or watch a show!</p>
<p><strong>Business owner?</strong> Back us from $500 and up and we'll promote your business through multiple social media and show shout outs, letting our audience know who you are! You will also be mentioned on our Major Supporters List on our website.</p>
<p><strong>Want more?</strong> From $2500 you'll receive an Executive Producer &amp; Sponsor credit with your logo on our website, festival programme and other printed PR along with multiple social media and show mentions - letting people know more about your company!</p>
<p>If you are a company based in Cape Town we also offer a 2 day team building improv workshop (of up to 30 employees) for your business where your employees will spend the day with one of our local experienced improvisors who will host games and formats used to promote confidence, trust and communication in the work place all while having a tonne of fun!</p>
<p><strong>The show must go on!</strong></p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, MCIF still happens - even if it means we'll have to scale back drastically on how many international teachers we can bring to the festival. We'll cut costs wherever we can. Fortunately the MCIF team are hustlers and super passionate about growing the improv community in South Africa, so no matter what, we will do our best to make sure this festival happens!</p>
<p>Let's think positively though... we are hoping to end up with more funds than what we've quoted for. If this happens then the festival gets even better and bigger venues, more PR, more teachers and also sponsoring other international performer's travel to join the fest!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact...</h3>
<p>By growing MCIF each year and exposing local improvisors to international teachers and players we are assuring that the South African improv community builds it's experience and knowledge base to further promote and teach improv skills and principles in schools, communities and businesses.</p>
<p>As well as further educating improvisors and creating a platform for them to grow, at MCIF we also offer courses for non-performers, people who are simply interested in having some fun, thinking out of the box and seeing what this improv thing is all about. We don't discriminate against experience, age or language (except maybe against the humorless).</p>
<h3><strong>What kind of courses?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Beginner courses: </strong> Improv 101s for the total novice - get your feet wet and see what it's all about! Then for the not so novice, but not yet intermediate - getting in more practice with professional coaching!</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate courses in short form improv:</strong> polish your improv skills, learn new games, challenge yourself with new concepts and approaches in short and long-form improv options.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced courses:</strong>  Go deep and break apart your playing, learn new techniques, recognise bad habits and take your improv even higher!</p>
<p><strong>Musical course: </strong> Learn to improvise with music - create songs and play with your voice and rhythms.  </p>
<p><strong>Teens course: </strong>With a focus on building an ensemble, teens develop their teamwork and listening skills in a non-judgemental and respectful environment where they are able to explore and expand their creativity.</p>

Want more? From $2500 you'll receive an Executive Producer & Sponsor credit with your logo on our website, festival programme and other printed PR along with multiple social media and show mentions - letting people know more about your company!
If you are a company based in Cape Town we also offer a 2 day team building improv workshop (of up to 30 employees) for your business where your employees will spend the day with one of our local experienced improvisors who will host games and formats used to promote confidence, trust and communication in the work place all while having a tonne of fun!
The show must go on!
If we don't reach our goal, MCIF still happens - even if it means we'll have to scale back drastically on how many international teachers we can bring to the festival. We'll cut costs wherever we can. Fortunately the MCIF team are hustlers and super passionate about growing the improv community in South Africa, so no matter what, we will do our best to make sure this festival happens!
Let's think positively though... we are hoping to end up with more funds than what we've quoted for. If this happens then the festival gets even better and bigger venues, more PR, more teachers and also sponsoring other international performer's travel to join the fest!
 

The impact...
By growing MCIF each year and exposing local improvisors to international teachers and players we are assuring that the South African improv community builds it's experience and knowledge base to further promote and teach improv skills and principles in schools, communities and businesses.
As well as further educating improvisors and creating a platform for them to grow, at MCIF we also offer courses for non-performers, people who are simply interested in having some fun, thinking out of the box and seeing what this improv thing is all about. We don't discriminate against experience, age or language (except maybe against the humorless).
What kind of courses?
Beginner courses:  Improv 101s for the total novice - get your feet wet and see what it's all about! Then for the not so novice, but not yet intermediate - getting in more practice with professional coaching!
Intermediate courses in short form improv: polish your improv skills, learn new games, challenge yourself with new concepts and approaches in short and long-form improv options.
Advanced courses:  Go deep and break apart your playing, learn new techniques, recognise bad habits and take your improv even higher!
Musical course:  Learn to improvise with music - create songs and play with your voice and rhythms.  
Teens course: With a focus on building an ensemble, teens develop their teamwork and listening skills in a non-judgemental and respectful environment where they are able to explore and expand their creativity.

<h3>INSPIRATION</h3>
<p>We are interested in exploring the vitality and free creativity that can be generated by a guided collaboration between artists working in a beautiful, and even healing, place. The public performance will be elemental, raw, and connected to the actors’ experience of and with the land. We want to explore how Shakespeare’s language--some of the most beautiful descriptions of the countryside and the relationship between the human and the environment--is illuminated by work in countryside that actually resembles that language. We want to explore how language changes bodies, and how bodies, in turn, change language; how language--poetry--contains hidden dimensions that can only be brought out by engaged meditation on, and practice with, that language. As Peter Brook writes, “[Theater] can never really change so long as culture or any art is simply an appendage on living, separable from it and, once separated, obviously unnecessary. Such art then is only fought for by the artist to whom, temperamentally, it is necessary, for it is his life. In the theatre we always return to the same point: it is not enough for writers and actors to experience this compulsive necessity, audiences must share it, too. So in this sense it is not just a question of wooing an audience. It is an even harder matter of creating works that evoke in audiences an undeniable hunger and thirst.”</p>
<h2>THE DIRECTOR</h2>
<p>As a writer-director, Matthew Gasda's productions are known for their creative uses of light and unusual stagings; a sense of immediacy and intimacy; rhetorical and emotional explosion. In addition to staging his own original dramas, Matthew directed a production of Howard Brenton’s 1983 play, “Bloody Poetry” first at the Brooklyn Art Library in New York, and this past April, in a greenhouse at The Sekrit Theater in Austin, TX. In 2015, he authored an award-winning adaptation of Euripides “The Bacchae” on commission from SUNY Oswego. Altogether, he has been involved in over 7 successful professional productions in the past 18 months.</p>
<h2>THE ENSEMBLE</h2>
<p>The biographies of the many actors involved in this workshop are too extensive to list here. Needless to say, even a quick inquiry into the backgrounds of the cast members will reveal a remarkably talented and worthy group of performing artists: Melissa Nelson; Jonathan Wilde; Veronika Dash; Kim Paris; Di Di Chan; Kossivi Alokpovi; Kayla Miller; Theresa Zeitz-Lindamood, Eliza Vann, and more TBA.</p>
<h2>THE PRODUCER</h2>
<p>Our producer, Mike DeCrosta, is local to the Lehigh Valley, and will be the liaison between the farm and local community and the workshop.  Michael has worked in the fields of urban planning and community development and is interested in the relationship between people and spaces that surround them. He received his Master's of Sociology from Lehigh University in 2015.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>PRACTICAL DETAILS</h2>
<p>What we are asking for here is enough money to cover transportation, food, and a small contribution to the Seed Farm (which is a non-profit organization). </p>
<p>We will show up, bring our own food, house ourselves, work independently during the<br/>day. The goal is to minimize troublesome or expensive elements. We will not be building a stage, using stage lights, speakers etc. As a rule we will not use anything that is not at our fingertips: voices, body, grass, trees, sunlight, moonlight. We are literally going to attempt to create a richly immersive version of Shakespeare's luminous play with as few resources as possible. A few resources, however, are not no resources.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>If this workshop is successful then the following happens:</p>
<p>- We build a troupe capable of bringing Midsummer back to New York City and beyond.</p>
<p>- We lay the groundwork for a future theater festival in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>- Art is done for arts sake: for the sake of expanding the expressive and imaginative range of a worthy group of creative artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>Theater is always difficult. Shakespeare is always difficult. On short notice, with limited resources, it is even harder. We intend to give a public after only 3 days of all-day work. The margin for error will be small. Memories will be tested, bodies will be tired. This however, is nothing that an experienced, supportive, passionate group of performing artists cannot overcome. Part of the power of the performance will come from the energy generated by the overcoming of practical obstacles.</p>

We set a very modest goal, and we have a waitlist of 37 schools that want our program, which means no gift is too small and surpassing our goal means we can reach even more children!HOW YOU CAN HELP:

Hailed for its superbly trained dancers and inventive choreography, the internationally-active KYL/D probes at the limits of national identity. Drawing upon Eastern philosophies while expanding the perimeter of contemporary dance, Artistic Director Lin's zen-inspired practice of dance manifests in lush works of poetic sensibility that The New York Times says ""create and inhabit worlds of their own."" Lin draws upon multicultural insights from his ongoing research throughout Asia, creating a personal movement language that is an unexpected hybrid between Western and Eastern cultures, suffused with strong spiritual underpinnings.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Our mission is to Share Our Stories With The World.</p>
<p>Hey, Troy here.....</p>
<p>Out of hundreds of entries, A Little Black Lie got selected to perform at the prestigious DC Black Theatre and Arts Festival in Washington, DC and we couldn't be more excited.  One of our goals for 2019 was to take ALBL on tour to the States in the Fall but clearly the Universe had other plans! At Crossfield House Productions, we believe in seizing opportunities when they come and performing our play twice on an international stage is one that we do not want to miss.  Since our beginning, CHP has been an independent, completely self funded company. As we get closer to Washington, we have realized that we need some help financially. We have a large team travelling (each person is needed, we cut where we could without sacrificing the integrity of the show) and the cost are higher than we anticipated (Thanks exchange rate!) and we also have the cost associated with producing our upcoming encore performance in Toronto in July.</p>
<p>Our community is rooted in everything that we do at CHP, you provide our stories, you are our biggest supporters and <strong>you</strong> are our biggest WHY...and we need your help to get us to DC.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So what do we need exactly? Our goal is to raise $3000.00.  This money will go towards the accommodations and transportation for our team. We will be renting cars to drive down and will be staying in Washington, DC from June 21st-June23rd.  </p>
<p>And guess what...your contribution could get you a part in our play! Or lunch with Troy! As a thank you we have some really cool perks available because we want to make sure that your support is acknowledged and that you know you are appreciated.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""When I started Crossfield House Productions, initially I wanted a space where I could be creatively free. A place where you could pitch an idea or a dream and instead of being told ‘no’, you heard ‘let’s figure out how to get this done’. With that mindset and determination, and the support of my team, I’ve been able to turn my ideas into successful, sold out plays: A Little White Lie and A Little Black Lie. This year, 2019, we will be producing films which will give us a wider reach and more opportunities for our people.""</p>
<p>The opportunities that will come out of performing ALBL in Washington will be huge for CHP and our community.

<p><strong>In spring of 2017, we debuted as a company</strong> with our very successful adaptation of <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. <strong>And now we are following up with a new adaptation of <i>Peter Pan</i>, </strong>opening this January at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek.</p>
<p><strong>For <i>Peter Pan</i>, we created this crowd funding campaign to secure the remaining funds we need for the budget. </strong>Your contributions will not only fund the show for it’s local debut, but thanks to our booking management company we are signed with, will allow the production to <strong>tour nationally and internationally for years to come!</strong></p>
<p>For <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, we used actors, high quality life sized puppetry, and a digitally projected Live Virtual Set to perform the stage show. You can click below to see the show onstage and see what we mean.</p>

<p><strong>With <i>Peter Pan</i></strong> we are going to perform the same way, but it will be a<strong> much bigger show!</strong></p>

<li>Bigger digital display</li>
<li>Bigger puppets (crocodile anyone?)</li>
<li>Special effects</li>
<li>A bigger creative team</li>
<li>A longer story with an intermission, and…</li>

<p> </p>
<h3>What makes this show different?</h3>
<p>While we’re keeping the story line and the characters that everyone loves, we’re putting our own <strong>fun twist on the show in our adaptation</strong>! We have 9 original puppets onstage and 11 well-known songs performed live with rewritten lyrics. And of course, flying! With the use of our Live Virtual Set, we can make Peter and Wendy fly through the air and into Never Land!</p>
<p>Our shows are<strong> highly entertaining</strong>, not only for children, but<strong> especially for parents as well. </strong>Everyone loves our offbeat humor, adults love waiting to hear what song comes next that they will recognize with cleverly written lyrics. Not to mention who doesn’t love the nostalgia of seeing<strong> </strong><strong>larger than life puppets onstage!?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>As a nationally recognized company</strong>, we travel to different performing arts centers for both public performances and school matinee performances. </p>
<p>Our adaptation of <i>Peter Pan </i>will <strong>teach children the power of their choices</strong>, and to place attention on what they want to create in their life. As Wendy learns from the Lost Boys, <i>""A brain full of fear has no room left for dreams!""</i> Curriculum connections include literature, writing, critical thinking, STEAM, and social-emotional learning.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><strong>Our productions are completely created from scratch</strong> with attention to detail. Each individual puppet is designed, engineered and built by hand, which can take up to 200 hours to create. All costuming is original and built by hand. The software for the Live Virtual Set takes hundreds of hours to create by Steve Axtell and his staff at Axtell Expressions.</p>

</div></div>","In spring of 2017, we debuted as a company with our very successful adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. And now we are following up with a new adaptation of Peter Pan, opening this January at the Lesher Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek.
For Peter Pan, we created this crowd funding campaign to secure the remaining funds we need for the budget. Your contributions will not only fund the show for it’s local debut, but thanks to our booking management company we are signed with, will allow the production to tour nationally and internationally for years to come!
For Alice in Wonderland, we used actors, high quality life sized puppetry, and a digitally projected Live Virtual Set to perform the stage show. You can click below to see the show onstage and see what we mean.


Alice in Wonderland Trailer
 

With Peter Pan we are going to perform the same way, but it will be a much bigger show!

Bigger digital display
Bigger puppets (crocodile anyone?)
Special effects
A bigger creative team
A longer story with an intermission, and…
We are moving into a larger, 800 seat theater!

 
What makes this show different?
While we’re keeping the story line and the characters that everyone loves, we’re putting our own fun twist on the show in our adaptation! We have 9 original puppets onstage and 11 well-known songs performed live with rewritten lyrics. And of course, flying! With the use of our Live Virtual Set, we can make Peter and Wendy fly through the air and into Never Land!
Our shows are highly entertaining, not only for children, but especially for parents as well. Everyone loves our offbeat humor, adults love waiting to hear what song comes next that they will recognize with cleverly written lyrics. Not to mention who doesn’t love the nostalgia of seeing larger than life puppets onstage!?

The piece was inspired by a metaphor I came across for healing from trauma: there is one type of jellyfish that takes little bits of nutrients from the sea bed and on the way up to the surface deposits little bits: providing nutrients for the whole ecosystem. </p><p>I recently read a book called: ""The vanishing face of Gaia""... and was inspired by this concept, as well as my studies of the age of Aquarius, and my hope for our spiritual evolution... of the evolving of the human psyche, of the evolution through healing from our traumas, of how we evolve and grow together when we connect, collaborate, and move up to the vibration of love and out of the low vibration of fear...</p><p>When I refer to LOVE overcoming fear, I refer to the innate fear for survival in every human, and I also refer to the current political climate: to the fear we hear repeatedly in the news: the xenophobic fear of 'other', to that time when Teresa May said that we humans are not allowed to be ""Citizens of the World"", to the votes that mean that we are now leaving Europe, to the 70 countries which now have built fences and walls as borders, and the 65 million people displaced since 2018 (the highest since World War 2!) </p><p>This story was also inspired by the love story (and the fight for their love) of my parents of different ethnicities/heritages in the 70s and 80s, and by the fear-mongering and xenophobic hate we seem to be bombarded with when we pick up the newspapers, or look on twitter, or switch on the tv this year. This piece of work is super important to all of us in the company: all having had direct personal experiences related to this topic which have fed in to the work.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/281838362?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><p>I originally dreamed up this interactive quiz show that crosses borders and oceans to challenge the human collision of difference: because I believe Art... the artists (and I believe we are ALL artists!) have a real power to understand, to tell real stories and to shout: in some ways more effectively than politicians (but perhaps not including my heroine Alexandria Ocasio Cortes!), and to give people a voice... but also to question our vote... our voice... to imagine a world where we were not about to Brexit, and to allow us to think about that: does our vote count?</p><p>In the wake of the doom and gloom of Brexit, we hope that this underwater world presents a utopian alternative reality: a world where there is no racism, no colourism, no inequality, no passports, no borders...and where the audience can reflect on what is gained and what is lost through cultural exchange and connection. </p><p>So now! Now we are awaiting an Arts Council Grant, and raising £2000 alongside that here, to create our set! </p><p>You will see sneak preview pictures of our set if you donate, made by the amazing Chris Durant in Newcastle! Our final R&amp;D will happen in November, with the full cast, the amazing Shelley Maxwell as Rehearsal Director and finally working with the set design, technology and lighting design to realise the piece.</p><p>We will be sharing the work at three Northern Venues, and everyone who donates will also be invited to watch on live stream. After this... the piece will be ready! We will be taking bookings (plus setting up our own UK tour!) You will be contributing to our company: Ella Mesma Company having a piece ready before going out on the road, and actually doing it properly! (Wahooooo!)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569160406/pdrwhp3r5vj5x2rhcd4l.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2>What We Need?</h2><p> </p><ul>
<li>This crowd funder is to go towards realising the set design, created by Chris Durant from Northern Stage, the full set comes to £2069.88 (we have added on the 5% that Indiegogo take on top so in total, we need to raise £2173.37) We know we will raise that with your help and because we are 100% focused on that End Result: so we hugely appreciate your being a part of that journey with us... and for that reason... there is no need to imagine any other scenario! (But no matter what, we do get to keep the money: and it goes towards our set).</li>
<li>These costs cover: Sheet Ply, Timber, Consummables, The paint finish, Festoon, Cables, Lamp holders, Lamps,Joining connectors, Staff costs (electrician, scenic art, a builder), The workshop hire and the VAT to realise this work... all things which I know not much about, but I do know exactly what I want to create and I love the design! </li>
<li>We need the set as part of the audience part in our Love Story: you guys will be voting in the show, and your votes will show up in real time on the set! (How exciting!) This is something I have been dreaming about since I first had the idea 3 years ago!</li>
</ul><h2>What You Get</h2><p>We have loads of prizes for donators to the campaign!</p><ol>

</ol><h2>Why Us?</h2><ol>
<li>We are a beautiful family: and we consider you a part of it too!</li>
<li>We are so grateful for every single part of this journey: and we honour and love you for your support in every way!</li>
<li>This show is set to be the best Ella Mesma Company show yet... maybe the best show ever! And you will be part of making that happen!</li>
<li>The company members are really good! You should see this dream team they are flipping awesome... Show them you believe in them!</li>
<li>We never give up... We have made loads of stuff before, we make shit happen... no matter what... </li>
<li>With each opportunity to practise, we just keep honing our skills bigger and better, and finding our unique voice.</li>
<li>Our work is different, underground, sometimes a bit alternative, sometimes a bit political, sometimes a bit revolutionary (We love it that way: because we believe that what art should be all about: and if you are here you probably do too!)</li>
<li>Artists deserve pay... artists have mad dope skills... exposure and experience don't pay our rent, (unfortunately, as a female choreographer, we are expected to just pull things out the bag on little money a lot more often than our male peers)... so sometimes we need to be creative about ways to make things happen... such as asking our audiences to  invest in us...</li>
<li>Some of the shows we have made in the past were made on little or no budget.... But look what can we do with money! With this money to make the set, with this funding... we will make an amazing show!</li>
<li>Sadly, if we don't have this money... there is no set, there is no audience participation, there is no quiz show... Yes we really cannot have a set without this money! The show... whilst awesome... will be flipping amazing (and hilarious: Milton is brilliant!) with this set and this quiz show as a part of it!</li>
</ol><h2>Thank you!</h2><p>Thank you everyone for reading, for supporting, to all who have funded and supported us, to all who have encouraged us, to everyone who has supported our crowdfunders in the past, for everyone supporting us by liking what we do, for coming to our shows, for the shares of things we might like, for offering us ideas, opinions... we love and value you! </p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><ol>
<li>Some people just can't contribute, we totally understand (we have been there too!) But that doesn't mean you can't be a part of the revolution! Help us by shouting about our dream team! Help us to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign! (Just click Share!)</li>

The piece was inspired by a metaphor I came across for healing from trauma: there is one type of jellyfish that takes little bits of nutrients from the sea bed and on the way up to the surface deposits little bits: providing nutrients for the whole ecosystem. I recently read a book called: ""The vanishing face of Gaia""... and was inspired by this concept, as well as my studies of the age of Aquarius, and my hope for our spiritual evolution... of the evolving of the human psyche, of the evolution through healing from our traumas, of how we evolve and grow together when we connect, collaborate, and move up to the vibration of love and out of the low vibration of fear...When I refer to LOVE overcoming fear, I refer to the innate fear for survival in every human, and I also refer to the current political climate: to the fear we hear repeatedly in the news: the xenophobic fear of 'other', to that time when Teresa May said that we humans are not allowed to be ""Citizens of the World"", to the votes that mean that we are now leaving Europe, to the 70 countries which now have built fences and walls as borders, and the 65 million people displaced since 2018 (the highest since World War 2!) This story was also inspired by the love story (and the fight for their love) of my parents of different ethnicities/heritages in the 70s and 80s, and by the fear-mongering and xenophobic hate we seem to be bombarded with when we pick up the newspapers, or look on twitter, or switch on the tv this year. This piece of work is super important to all of us in the company: all having had direct personal experiences related to this topic which have fed in to the work.I originally dreamed up this interactive quiz show that crosses borders and oceans to challenge the human collision of difference: because I believe Art... the artists (and I believe we are ALL artists!) have a real power to understand, to tell real stories and to shout: in some ways more effectively than politicians (but perhaps not including my heroine Alexandria Ocasio Cortes!), and to give people a voice... but also to question our vote... our voice... to imagine a world where we were not about to Brexit, and to allow us to think about that: does our vote count?In the wake of the doom and gloom of Brexit, we hope that this underwater world presents a utopian alternative reality: a world where there is no racism, no colourism, no inequality, no passports, no borders...and where the audience can reflect on what is gained and what is lost through cultural exchange and connection. So now! Now we are awaiting an Arts Council Grant, and raising £2000 alongside that here, to create our set! You will see sneak preview pictures of our set if you donate, made by the amazing Chris Durant in Newcastle! Our final R&D will happen in November, with the full cast, the amazing Shelley Maxwell as Rehearsal Director and finally working with the set design, technology and lighting design to realise the piece.We will be sharing the work at three Northern Venues, and everyone who donates will also be invited to watch on live stream. After this... the piece will be ready! We will be taking bookings (plus setting up our own UK tour!) You will be contributing to our company: Ella Mesma Company having a piece ready before going out on the road, and actually doing it properly! (Wahooooo!)What We Need? 
This crowd funder is to go towards realising the set design, created by Chris Durant from Northern Stage, the full set comes to £2069.88 (we have added on the 5% that Indiegogo take on top so in total, we need to raise £2173.37) We know we will raise that with your help and because we are 100% focused on that End Result: so we hugely appreciate your being a part of that journey with us... and for that reason... there is no need to imagine any other scenario! (But no matter what, we do get to keep the money: and it goes towards our set).
These costs cover: Sheet Ply, Timber, Consummables, The paint finish, Festoon, Cables, Lamp holders, Lamps,Joining connectors, Staff costs (electrician, scenic art, a builder), The workshop hire and the VAT to realise this work... all things which I know not much about, but I do know exactly what I want to create and I love the design! 
We need the set as part of the audience part in our Love Story: you guys will be voting in the show, and your votes will show up in real time on the set! (How exciting!) This is something I have been dreaming about since I first had the idea 3 years ago!
What You GetWe have loads of prizes for donators to the campaign!
First of all, everybody will invited to watch the full sharing: we will hold three in the North of England... and for all our friends in the rest of the world, we will invite you via live stream. (Everyone welcome: we will send you your invitation upon donation)
We have 5 guest tickets to watch the show during our tour at the city of your choice (again make sure you leave your email to be contacted and for us to choose which city you will watch the show in. (This is for donations of £200 and above)
We have 3 invitations to watch a private rehearsal either during this phase or during our tour at the city of your choice (again make sure you leave your email to be contacted: for you to choose which city you will watch in!) (This can be selected upon donation)
We have 2 personal videos which we will make for your enjoyment during our rehearsals,,, (This one can be selected upon donation!)
We have one dinner invitation (In Newcastle!) We will cook you a feast! Come round and hang out with the whole company for one evening (This one can be selected upon donation: you just need to come to our rehearsals in Newcastle!)
We will also do one VIP giveaway: for one lucky donator (selected with your name in the hat)... We will write to each donator personally (please make sure you leave us your email address to be contacted!) to take part in a draw for our Maya Gandaia trip to Thailand with all of the teaching fees discounted (so you will pay only for your stay at the gorgeous 5* resort and your flights but get all your classes and workshops completely free!)

Why Us?
We are a beautiful family: and we consider you a part of it too!
We are so grateful for every single part of this journey: and we honour and love you for your support in every way!
This show is set to be the best Ella Mesma Company show yet... maybe the best show ever! And you will be part of making that happen!
The company members are really good! You should see this dream team they are flipping awesome... Show them you believe in them!
We never give up... We have made loads of stuff before, we make shit happen... no matter what... 
With each opportunity to practise, we just keep honing our skills bigger and better, and finding our unique voice.
Our work is different, underground, sometimes a bit alternative, sometimes a bit political, sometimes a bit revolutionary (We love it that way: because we believe that what art should be all about: and if you are here you probably do too!)
Artists deserve pay... artists have mad dope skills... exposure and experience don't pay our rent, (unfortunately, as a female choreographer, we are expected to just pull things out the bag on little money a lot more often than our male peers)... so sometimes we need to be creative about ways to make things happen... such as asking our audiences to  invest in us...
Some of the shows we have made in the past were made on little or no budget.... But look what can we do with money! With this money to make the set, with this funding... we will make an amazing show!
Sadly, if we don't have this money... there is no set, there is no audience participation, there is no quiz show... Yes we really cannot have a set without this money! The show... whilst awesome... will be flipping amazing (and hilarious: Milton is brilliant!) with this set and this quiz show as a part of it!
Thank you!Thank you everyone for reading, for supporting, to all who have funded and supported us, to all who have encouraged us, to everyone who has supported our crowdfunders in the past, for everyone supporting us by liking what we do, for coming to our shows, for the shares of things we might like, for offering us ideas, opinions... we love and value you! Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, we totally understand (we have been there too!) But that doesn't mean you can't be a part of the revolution! Help us by shouting about our dream team! Help us to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign! (Just click Share!)
Stay in touch: share your thoughts, talk to us, talk to each other, make art, be part of the (re)volution!
THANK YOU WE LOVE YOU!",10.0,1,"3 Campaigns

<p>Over the past 25 years, our company has been of service, playing back community stories of resistance, immigration, love, home, and activism. We’ve performed hundreds of times across the United States in an effort to create healing, connection and community. If you’ve seen Playback Theatre, you know how vital this work can be to combat hate and suffering with empathy and understanding. As a diverse collective of 14 artists, we feel called to this work.</p>
<p>At the International Playback Theatre Conference in India, the Living Arts Playback Theatre Ensemble will assist in a workshop facilitated by our director, psychotherapist and drama therapist, Armand Volkas. He will guide conference attendees in a process that focuses on  intercultural conflict transformation and healing historical trauma. Armand will use his approach with the goal of building empathy between historical enemies through Playback Theatre. Through Armand’s facilitation, Playback Theatre practitioners from many countries and cultures will be exposed to his innovative Peacebuilding work.</p>
<p>If you are able to donate a gift of any amount, you’ll be investing in peace during a time of deep division in our country and beyond. You’ll be sending us to India to learn from other artists and healers. For you, community, we are deeply grateful.</p>

<p>Armand Volkas  is the Director of the Living Arts Playback Theatre Ensemble. He is a psychotherapist and Registered Drama Therapist in private practice and Clinical Director of the Living Arts Counseling Center in Oakland, California, where he directs a training program for students, interns and therapists who want to integrate drama therapy into their practice.

In addition, Armand is Associate Professor in the Counseling Psychology Program at California Institute of Integral Studies and Adjunct Professor at John F. Kennedy University. He has developed innovative programs using drama therapy and expressive arts therapies for social change, intercultural conflict resolution, reconciliation and intercultural communication. Volkas directs Healing the Wounds of History, a therapeutic approach in which theatre techniques are used to work with groups of participants from two cultures with a common legacy of violent conflict and historical trauma. At the heart of Armand’s work is a profound respect for the power of personal story to build bridges between people and cultures.</p>
