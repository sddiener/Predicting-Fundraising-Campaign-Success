<p>The volunteers of HELP International have discovered an incredibly critical need for access to clean drinking water in Northern Tanzania. Using our time and effort and your help, we will be able to drill a well that will bring clean drinking water to a village of nearly 3,000 people!</p>
<p>Water is LIFE. We need it to DRINK. We need it to WASH. We need it to live. Only 54% of the Tanzania population has access to improved water supplies and 24% have access to adequate sanitation. The current water source for these villagers is an infected water hole. Since this is the only available source of water, it is often contaminated from washing, human and animal waste, garbage, and even dead animals. Drinking unsafe water leads to illness by water-borne diseases. Each year, 20,000 children die before the age of five in Tanzania due to diarrheal diseases.  </p>
<p>Because the available water source is a long distance from the village, women and children spend over two hours a day collecting water and sometimes up to seven hours for villagers in remote areas. These hours could be spent at a job, in school, or doing other things at home. Lives would be saved and quality of life would improve with an accessible well in this village.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Project Plan</strong></h3>
<p>HELP International has been coordinating the Village Water Project with the organization WHOlives and the Village Drill. The village Drill is a well drilling unit that was designed in the United States as a cheaper alternative to commercial well drilling available in Tanzania. Because this drill is completely man-powered and is easily transported, the entire operation is far more affordable and effective way to bring clean water to people around the world.</p>
<p>We want to involve the village as much as possible. They will help to drill the well, install the pipes and pump, and learn how to manage and maintain the drill in the future. This is their village project to learn to work together and help each other; we are just here to guide them along.</p>
<h3><strong>Project Budget</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Cost to drill the well: $3,200</li>
<li>Water Pump: $1,100</li>
<li>Transportation to Village Site: $1,000</li>
<li>Misc Supplies: $150</li>
</ul><p>This budget includes all costs associated with creating a fully functional water-giving well. Transportation cost includes the transportation of the drill, supplies, volunteers, and drilling guide to the site. Drilling cost includes the cost to pay workers to operate the drill with us, the pay for drilling guide, the necessary pipes needed for the well walls, the concrete pad for the top. Cost for the Indian Mark 2 Water Pump is the quoted price from the company. Miscellaneous supplies include water tests and instructional materials for the pump. </p>

<h3>Who We Are &amp; What We're Doing</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are a group of researchers interested in how doulas, childbirth educators, and labor &amp; delivery nurses in the US and Canada view recent trends in childbirth practices and outcomes, and each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We knew we could do better research as a group than we could individually, so we have been meeting for the past two years via conference call; contributing equally to the survey development and are about ready to launch!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Several membership organizations for doulas, childbirth educators, and labor &amp; delivery nurses in the US and Canada have agreed to help us recruit participants to our survey by sending emails to their members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are on a bare bones research budget - the graduate students will use the data for their dissertation research; and we need $3000 to cover our immediate costs for the online survey, our website domain registration, and organizational fees to access members. </p>
</li>
<li>Depending on the level of support, you'll get our most sincere thanks, acknowledgement on our website, advance copy of research summary, teleconference with research team or written acknowledgement on all publications.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>If we EXCEED our goal, we can afford to pay our grad students for data analysis.  If we don't meet our goal, we can still use funds to cover our expenses.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>We care about maternity outcomes and believe our research will contribute to our understanding of how maternity support workers can help improve care to women and newborns.</li>
<li>The co-investigators have successfully conducted research projects on maternity topics.  Louise Roth is also doing research on how malpractice and the health insurance system influence maternity care, including the rate of cesarean delivery. Christine Morton is interviewing women, their partners and providers on traumatic childbirth experiences.</li>
<li>The graduate students are doing dissertation work on emotional burnout, doula work as a career, breastfeeding support and documentation routines.  This project will make huge contributions to the nursing and childbirth literature.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We hope those of you doing maternity support work, or who have benefitted from having a great doula, childbirth educator or labor &amp; delivery nurse will consider supporting much needed research on these critical, yet overlooked roles in maternity care.</p>
<p>If you can't afford to help us with a monetary contribution, please share this link far and wide among your social networks, and using the Indiegogo share tools is a great way to do this.</p>

<h3><strong>Hi my name is Kristy Lockhart and I work in a retirement home as a cook. My best friend has been diagnosed with Lyme Disease and I wish to do everything I can to help her. This is a desperate plea to everybody to please help me financially get her the treatment she requires in the U.S.A. In Canada testing and treatment are not available. The majority of people with Lyme disease are misdiagnosed for years and by the time it is discovered it is almost too late. Treatment for this disease is extremely expensive. Not including gas and car rental it is $1,000 for the first time meet up with a Lyme doctor.</strong></h3>
<p>4 years ago she had a gym membership, walked 5 miles a day, hiked, spent time in nature, and constantly doing photoshoots. Now, she can't walk more than 20 minutes, has to ride a handicap bus, has difficulty breathing, chest pains, migraines, her joints swell up so bad she can't write or type, difficulty folding laundry, doing dishes and playing with her cat. Something in her body is malfunctioning as her entire body is covered in edema and this year she had to go on heart medication as this disease is affecting her heart now.</p>
<p>This woman means everything to me.  I can't put into words how much I love her. She is an amazing artist/photographer (<a href=""http://www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.redbubble.com/people/locustgirl</a>) and a genuine pure soul and there's nothing I won't do for her. Meeting someone like this only happens once in a lifetime, and I fear her lifetime will be over soon if no medical treatment is begun.</p>
<p>Donating to this compain will ensure proper medical care and treatment and lodging while undergoing this care. It doesn't matter if it's $1 or $1000 every little bit helps. Even if you have no $ to donate, please will you post this on various social networking tools to spread the word?</p>
<p>Even while ill, both she and I helped out with other fundraisers (Rideau Valley Wildlife Sanctuary) by donating hundreds of dollars worth of her art to be sold to help treat injured wildlife. She went to college to learn how to take care of the disabled, now she is disabled.</p>
<p>She has no one who can help her but me and she hasn't worked for the last 2 years due to being so ill. I am a single woman and the ONLY person who has been helping her for years, please can you help me help her.</p>
There is a serious gap in Canada for testing and treatment of this horrible disease. Recently Elizabeth May (MP) introduced a new bill into parliament detailing how this disease should be dealt with.  This is good for the future, but my friend needs help IMMEDIATELY.</div>
<div>My best friend, Heather, has seen 50 doctors in the last 4 years (including 3 neurosurgeons) which she was left with no definitive answers as to the root cause of all her symptoms, until now. Lyme disease, if not detected in the early stages becomes chronic lyme and ends up attacking the heart, kidneys and liver.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are givers and this is very hard to ask for help. To prove this, for certain denomonations I will print and mail to you your choices from Heather's photography gallery. If you love wildlife and nature or creative works combining the beautiful female form with nature, you are sure to love Heather King's artwork. Side note: there are some pieces on her site which have a filter on them. Please know that nothing was done for shock value.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We, Nick Coats and Gianluca Paparo, are very excited to share an experience and a journey with all of you. The “Just Cause We Walk” team are journeying across the country on foot to bring a broader understanding and support for the cure of this disease that claimed the lives of over half a million people in the United States last year.</p>
<p>Our journey will take us through over a dozen of our country's beautiful states. We will be taking pictures and documenting online as we are able. This adventure has become possible with the support of our friends and families but with your support, and our support of your organization, together we can make this much more than a long walk, but a march for life, love, and hope.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are respectfully requesting monetary contributions, or even just spreading the word, to make this happen. Your support will make this cause a worthy one. Any form of sponsorship will allow us to bring not only awareness but also help keep us alive on this mission. We hope you can utilize some of your resources to help a couple of individuals that want to make a more substantial difference. Anyone that donates will surely get a personalized thank you from us!    </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>People give blood, sweat, and tears as they suffer from this disease. If we wish to make a difference, if we wish to change the suffering they endure, can we endure any less? We can't. We are prepared to give our own blood, sweat, and tears to show people that those who suffer are no different than any of us. We are tired of standing by; we are tired of watching. We want to start doing. As such we have chosen the hardest route to walk, and have forgone a lot of amenities others have employed. We will have no follow car, no drop point of food or water every few miles, and absolutely no mile traveled that is not on foot. We will carry all our food and water and resupply in the cities we stop in. We will have our phones for emergencies along with our willingness and determination.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Now we are turning to you to help our paraplegic son live near us because of his many medical needs, but allow him to have the independence any man of his age needs from his parents.  (His doctor recommends that he live near family because in 2010 when his first replacement valve failed, he almost did not get to the hospital in time because no one checked on him daily.)  We don't want something like that to happen again!</p>
<p>Todd is a natural mechanic and has an engineering mind.  He is very generous with his time and energy when he is not in the hospital or recuperating from surgery.  He has many friends and is an asset to everyone who knows him because he fixes things for them.  If they have something that is broken (exception of computorized things) he finds a way to fix it.  He is thoughtful and is always coming up with ways to brighten others lives.  He may mow their lawns, plow snow from their sidewalks and driveways, give them produce or flowers he has grown, or grilled, smoked, or jerkeyed meats he has made. </p>

<p>If you cannot help us at this time, please share this story with others who may be able to.   Thank you!</p></div>","We are a family that works together and plays together.  Probably a lot like yours.  When one of our family members has a problem, we all try to help in any way we can.  We have done all we can do to fix this problem and have fallen short. 
Now we are turning to you to help our paraplegic son live near us because of his many medical needs, but allow him to have the independence any man of his age needs from his parents.  (His doctor recommends that he live near family because in 2010 when his first replacement valve failed, he almost did not get to the hospital in time because no one checked on him daily.)  We don't want something like that to happen again!
Todd is a natural mechanic and has an engineering mind.  He is very generous with his time and energy when he is not in the hospital or recuperating from surgery.  He has many friends and is an asset to everyone who knows him because he fixes things for them.  If they have something that is broken (exception of computorized things) he finds a way to fix it.  He is thoughtful and is always coming up with ways to brighten others lives.  He may mow their lawns, plow snow from their sidewalks and driveways, give them produce or flowers he has grown, or grilled, smoked, or jerkeyed meats he has made. 
Because we all love him and have watched him go through so much trauma and dissapointment, we cannot help wanting to give back to him.  Most of his friends are in the construction trades and want to donate their time and skills to build him an apartment and a garage to house his truck in with room to keep busy doing what he loves best, fixing things.

<h3>Bam2 - Le projet</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Le projet est simple. Une salle freestyle de 1000 m² au total, composée de trampolines, d'un bac à mousse, d'un super tramp, d'un big air et de son air bag.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Véritable terrain de jeux pour petits et grands, débutants ou expérimentés, cette salle est LA solution pour tous ceux qui souhaitent progresser en toute sécurité. Evolutive, l'infrastructure contient au total 4 zones, permettant à chacun de progresser à son rythme. Notre concept, différent des salles de trampoline traditionnelles, est à l'heure actuelle unique en France.</div>

<h3>Risques et défis</h3>
<p>Chez BAM Freesports. Nous savons que la réussite de cette salle dépendra essentiellement de la qualité du matériel. </p>
<p>C'est pourquoi, on vous prépare une structure aux petits oignons !<br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">On prête une attention particulière à la qualité des matériaux choisis, aux techniques de fabrication et à nos fournisseurs. A titre d'exemple, le big air est construit par un fabricant de rampes de skatepark (la bifurk, Grenoble), notre super tramp vient des USA (yeah !), l'air bag est différent des air bag traditionnels (Travis Pastrana et Nitro Circus utilisent le même) et nous suivons rigoureusement la fabrication de nos trampolines.</span></p>

Bam2 - Le projet
Le projet est simple. Une salle freestyle de 1000 m² au total, composée de trampolines, d'un bac à mousse, d'un super tramp, d'un big air et de son air bag.
Véritable terrain de jeux pour petits et grands, débutants ou expérimentés, cette salle est LA solution pour tous ceux qui souhaitent progresser en toute sécurité. Evolutive, l'infrastructure contient au total 4 zones, permettant à chacun de progresser à son rythme. Notre concept, différent des salles de trampoline traditionnelles, est à l'heure actuelle unique en France.




Risques et défis
Chez BAM Freesports. Nous savons que la réussite de cette salle dépendra essentiellement de la qualité du matériel. 
C'est pourquoi, on vous prépare une structure aux petits oignons !On prête une attention particulière à la qualité des matériaux choisis, aux techniques de fabrication et à nos fournisseurs. A titre d'exemple, le big air est construit par un fabricant de rampes de skatepark (la bifurk, Grenoble), notre super tramp vient des USA (yeah !), l'air bag est différent des air bag traditionnels (Travis Pastrana et Nitro Circus utilisent le même) et nous suivons rigoureusement la fabrication de nos trampolines.

Healer2Healer is a young organization and has not yet cultivated corporate or private funding, therefore all cost of the trips are up to the individual members. With your help, I'm able to give others. Any amount of your energy is welcome. 
 
My financial goal will cover 10 days expenses - April 18-28th (accommodation, meal, inland transportation) + round air ticket. 
To meet the requirements, I need to make the full payment by 31st of March 2011. 
 
Contributing $50 and more I will send you (or your pet) 20 min of distant Reiki, however any support is highly appreciated.

<p>We must help the woman that had a huge tumor cut out of her head and still cannot live a regular life. She has been diligent with her therapies and recovery while showing the utmost kindness to everyone she comes in contact. She has one more hurdle and a way to recover. The Mayo Clinic. Help cover her cost of this trip to the Mayo where she will hopefully find a treatment that will make everyday more bearable.</p>
<h3>We all benefit from having Meredith healthy, happy, and in the world.</h3>
<p>The brightness that Meredith brings to the world is invaluable. She loves children and has never met a stranger. Every time I see her I get to hear a story of someone she meets. She observes the joy of children. She feels the challenges of daily life for anyone she meets. I think that she can truly empathise with anyone. She can walk out of the ladies room with a story about a person that she bonded with while drying her hands. And I love that about her. </p>
<h3>The problem. </h3>
<p>MeBo does not currently have a tumor in her head, thanks to a specialized surgery. She does, however, have a lot of unintended challenges (side effects?) from the tumor removal. These include double vision, dizziness, challenges because of her shunt (a tube that still drains fluid from her brain into her abdomen), fatigue, and chronic pain. </p>
<p>The chronic pain is the one we are currently working on. Chronic pain. Doctors have been baffled. She has seen several people to try and diagnose the problem. There has been no answer to this one so far. The only solace that anyone could offer was pain killers. This is no way to live. Mebo would rather find a better alternative. Besides, taking pain killers, create further uninended consequences like not being able to drive or eat normal foods, bacically further cutting her off from everyday living. </p>
<h3>There is a ray of sunlight. </h3>
<p>There is a program at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota that has decided to take Mererdith to go through a 3-week inpatient diagnostic testing and treatment regimen. It takes 3 weeks and will cost $3000 dollars to get up there and pay for a room in that time. It is worth it for a pain-free life. </p>
<h3>Why ask for this much?</h3>
<p>The goal is $3,330 because it covers the bare bones cost of this trip to the Mayo plus a small cushion to take care of the indiegogo fees. If I could waive a wand, I would take all of the burden off of my friends (I don't even know what it is, but brain surgery is not cheap). Ideally we could push the boundaries and have more to help pay off some of the medical burden that has plagued her since the doctor said ""brain tumor"".</p>
<p>The financial strain is a level of stress that causes just as much trouble as anything else she has faced, but there is little hope of getting out from under this debt burden. I am taking this to all of you her friends, family, and other great people she has touched (or still could) because A little help can go a long way and I think we can helpher usher in a new era.</p>
<h3>I ask the world to help my kind and loving friend.</h3>
<p>I get to see mer about once a month when she is feeling well and we can get together. Often out visits are short because of her fatigue and pain. Lets band together and help her to have more full days. </p></div>","Hi. Meredith (AKA Mebo) is my friend and she is truly a person worthy of your love & support.

<p>You probably haven’t heard of EB. Nor had we. After our son Jackson was born in 2007, he had a routine heel prick and the nurse placed a band-aid on his heel. When the band-aid was removed, all of the skin on his tiny foot tore off with it. Jackson was soon diagnosed with a severe form of Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) - he lacks a critical protein that binds the layers of his skin together. In practical terms, the skin across his entire body is fragile and can blister easily.  Like all kids with EB, pain is a part of his daily life as are bleach bath bandage changes. When things are bad, he cannot swallow as his esophagus blisters and tears just like his skin.  Many normal activities – such as the sports kids like to play – are out of the question. The damage from EB is cumulative.  At his young age, it has already left its indelible mark.</p>
<p>Jackson is not alone. In fact, there are thousands of children in the world who suffer from this terrible disease. You can find more information about the disease and Jackson at <a href=""http://www.JGSF.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""JGSF home"">www.JGSF.org</a>. <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/SupportBabyEastonFriedel"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></span></p>
<p>Jamie &amp; Alex Silver (co-founders of JGSF)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How can I help?</strong></p>
<p>We are in a brutally fast race against time to find a cure for EB and to give Jackson and all the children like him pain-free lives. We started the Jackson Gabriel Silver Foundation (JGSF), a non-profit organization, in 2007 to raise funds for EB research. We have almost no administration costs and all of our staff volunteers. We aim to give as close as possible to 100% of the money we receive to fund research to cure the disease and have dedicated our lives to finding and funding the most promising research into EB cures and to date, we have raised almost $1 million and given grants to support advanced therapies at leading institutions including Stanford University, the University of Minnesota, the University of Southern California and others. Researchers have made significant progress since Jackson was born and we genuinely believe that if we can continue to fund this cutting edge research, we can find a cure for EB soon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why give money now?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently funding the work of Dr. Jakub Tolar and his team at the University of Minnesota. His work is groundbreaking and we believe can save the lives of children with EB as well as those who suffer from many other genetic illnesses. We plan to raise $225,000 to help fund Dr Tolar’s research and would love your help - our goal is to raise $25,000 from Indiegogo users to help fund this research to change childrens’ lives. We are part of a campaign that has agreed to match the university dollar for dollar- in practice this means that every dollar you give will be matched and every dollar will be worth $2 to fund research.</p>
<p>At JGSF, we are committed to ending this terrible disease- please join us in our fight.</p></div>","Let's cure EB

Facial hair grows very quickly for women and we don't always have the time or money to keep it maintained.  No Mo-Stache eliminates high maintenance cost and eliminates one more chore added to the list.  Women have enough to think about on the daily, don't let a mustache be on your mind or on your face. Use No Mo-Stache for every stache, every time!
We strongly believe No Mo-Stache is a product every woman should have. We are raising funds to help grow this product on a national level.     We are looking for funding to make this concept successfully marketable and to publicize on a national level. 
Helping women prevent embarrassing moments one mustache at a time. 
Thank you for your support!
Jennifer & Gita
 

 
What We Need & What You Get


We need $5,000 in order to appropriately market No Mo-Stache.  We also need the funds for publicity which will take this product nationwide.  
You have the opportunity to make women free of facial hair in a cost effective way.  Lets work together! 


We are prepared to overcome many risks and challenges in our efforts to bring No Mo-Stache on public level. From thought to conception we have used our networks in both the fashion and beauty industries to create a product that would appeal to both markets. We believe that No Mo-Stache will be successful using our backgrounds in Sales and Beauty industries.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p><span>Over the past decade, the health and wellness industry has been on a rapid incline. Plain Jane and Average Joe are finally fed up with spending countless hours at impersonal “globo-gyms” in fruitless attempts to get fit. They have spent days, weeks, months, and years in a gym with no sense of community, where they workout and leave without a “Hello” or “Have a great day” from the staff. It is no surprise that people are flocking in droves to boutique gyms  (commonly known as boxes) around the world. In these boxes, they achieve health and wellness goals above and beyond what they ever imagined. They are finding community, friendship, and healthy competition. They are not only getting in shape, but many of them are becoming true competitive athletes.</span></p>
<p>We want to focus on highlighting the competitive aspect of the athletes that train in these boxes. Who doesn’t like a good local competition? They are all over the place, yet if you are unable to  physically go see them, wouldn’t it be great to have another means of seeing them? We have collectively spent years attending competitions of this nature and have personally seen some amazing feats of courage, determination, community and sportsmanship; where by the nature of this fitness community,  the last person to finish organically gets the loudest cheers from the fans and all the while, fellow competitors coach them to finish strong. We want to capture this VERY essence on camera for everyone around the world to experience from the comforts of your own home. Stay at home moms, lawyers, students, neighbors and the like compete on the same teams as former Division 1 middle linebackers. Every athlete is cheered on and encouraged to strive for the indomitable will of the human spirit. We want you cheering for your favorite box and your fellow athletes who are out there fighting for their chance to take it all.. the grand prize and bragging rights to be the King of All Boxes!</p>
<p>The majority of us do not do what those elite athletes can do, but 100% of us love the sport of fitness, love the challenge, and most of all, we are all passionate about our communities and the culture naturally embedded in our boxes. We would love the opportunity to be able to bring all of this to every single one of you.</p>

athlete tournament as well, so if the viewer’s team is not doing well, they can
continue to cheer for and follow their favorite athletes. We will have
biographies set up so people can see that many of these competitive athletes
are Average Joe’s and Jane’s just like them. The website will have a discussion

</div></div>","Short Summary Carol Barnette was diagnosed with lung cancer in June 2014 and has undergone a radical surgery, from which she is still recovering.  She has medical bills pending from her surgery as well as prescription and other related costs of treatment for this devastating disease. Even though Carol has Medicare, there are still co-payments and extra fees for treatments, medicines, and doctor visits. Carol must also drive a substantial distance to and from chemotherapy, as well as hire any outside help for some personal and household needs. Because she has been unable to work at her freelance job, she has no way to finance these extra costs herself.

<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Hi everyone 10 days left to go, already we raised 42%. We get many questions about what happens if we did not reach a goal. You get anyway working device if we reach a goal or not. However, first prototype version will work only on windows platforms. We will come back to SmartPhone app later but now priority is to improve hardware, firmware and software algorithm.</span><br/></p>
<p>Delivery deadline is not changed and remains the same, it is 2014 February as mentioned in the perk. So we ship no earlier than January 2014. If you forgot to add shipping costs we remind you by sending email to you. Some of you forgot to add shipping address as well we write an email to ask you to do this.</p>

<p>Medical diagnostic systems such as personal health assistants, designed for the home care environment would be economically, and socially beneficial. As the result, early disease treatment by detection of abnormalities could reduce hospitalization costs, doctor visits, health care labor force and improve the quality of life. </p>
<p>Continuing the previous research, we build the multi-functional device, developed for home surroundings, with similar methodologies found in hospitals.</p>
<p>Heart Risk Warner is unique as it employs multiple medical methods and assesses the risk of your heart. It is rather small and lightweight so you can have it in your pocket.</p>
<p>Using this device you can benefit of knowing about possible heart risk existence and prevent future heart risk. Risk of possible heart disease or heart problems like stroke, coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure or heart attack, they are main disorders of the heart and blood vessels.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Today in world the heart disease is one of the major cause of death. For example, risk of having a stroke doubles every decade and after the age of 55 the risk grows advancing in age (WHO). Several studies showed that many people are unaware about their health condition and are not diagnosed until their deaths. It is projected that in the next half of this century elderly population will be growing more rapid than ever before. This indicates that heart problems will be more and more topical than today.</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify; line-height: normal;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/19118/files/20130818092032-Cause_of_deaths_from_CVD_world_2008.png?1376842832"" src="""" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""/><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Hypertension (or high blood pressure), coronary artery disease, arrhythmias are consequences, which will later can evolve to serious health injuries such as heart attack, stroke or sudden death. At the early stages sometimes it is difficult to measure and diagnose health state, because it is not easy observable. For instance hypertension sometimes called “silent killer”, symptoms are not appreciable in early stages until it develops to serious health risk. Likewise arrhythmias sometimes are difficult to measure, if they occur in short time of periods. Therefore, leading causes of chronic diseases often bring enormous harm to state of health, as well as economically it is disadvantageous.</span></p></span><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">When you get sick, most likely that the first thing you are doing is checking your body temperature. Temperature measurements sometimes are not informative and can be limited to some aspects. Therefore, Heart Risk Warner extends functionality and allows you to get more information such as heart rate, arrhythmia detection, heart rate variability, blood pressure, stiffness index. Thus, you are given extensive information focused on your heart, i.e. the function of the heart and prediction of future heart risk.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">For continuous vascular system estimation we selected photoplethysmography, electrocardiography, accelerometers and others technologies. Combination of different technologies allows us to apply more medical methods. That gives important vital signs what are key elements for the heart risk estimation. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">How does it work</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">During research there wasn't found a single heart risk assessment algorithm, comprised of multiple medical methods. We found the most relevant methods and connected them together. We created simple rule based algorithm structure as a voting system, with separate nodes and defined coefficient values expressed as a risk weight. Coefficient values selected with significance order, and total heart risk calculated by the sum of all coefficients. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">With existing sensors we connected medical methods into a single algorithm. Major methods shown below:</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">1) Electrocardiography.</b><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""> It is the significant mean for the proper heart diagnosis such as myocardial infarction, ischemia, and, etc. Heart disease or heart deterioration could be referred to particular type of arrhythmia. However, ECG interpretation and diagnosis requires experienced knowledge. However existing software algorithms referring to the problem can work with accuracy up to 98 or 99%. Making to believe that machines can do a really good job for us. </span></p>

One of them is a well know blood pressure estimation from a pulse transit time. Measurements performed from peripheral PPG wave and ECG R wave.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Blood pressure acts an important role to track your health state. According to American Heart Association (AHA) or Yale University School of medicine heart book, resting blood pressure can be classified into cardiovascular risk groups with recommended activities. Correct blood pressure  estimation can be significant cardiovascular risk prevention.</span></p>

Framingham study showed that increased resting heart rate has an significant correlation with cardiovascular diseases and coronary heart diseases, which are leading cause to the increased mortality rates. Maximal physical capacity can be expressed with maximal heart rate, which is important in a proper rehabilitation, physical activity and disease prevention programs. For instance, in some clinical settings, physical activity is stopped when the subject reaches 85% of his maximal heart rate.

Stiffen arteries usually is the consequence of age or atherosclerosis, which is the cause to develop myocardial infarction or stroke; therefore, arterial stiffness index is a good myocardial infarction or stroke predictor. Derived data from pulse wave analysis can detect a patient who has coronary artery disease or hypertension.<br/></span></p>

UPDATE: 2013 October 03
Hi everyone 10 days left to go, already we raised 42%. We get many questions about what happens if we did not reach a goal. You get anyway working device if we reach a goal or not. However, first prototype version will work only on windows platforms. We will come back to SmartPhone app later but now priority is to improve hardware, firmware and software algorithm.
Delivery deadline is not changed and remains the same, it is 2014 February as mentioned in the perk. So we ship no earlier than January 2014. If you forgot to add shipping costs we remind you by sending email to you. Some of you forgot to add shipping address as well we write an email to ask you to do this.

Medical diagnostic systems such as personal health assistants, designed for the home care environment would be economically, and socially beneficial. As the result, early disease treatment by detection of abnormalities could reduce hospitalization costs, doctor visits, health care labor force and improve the quality of life. 
Continuing the previous research, we build the multi-functional device, developed for home surroundings, with similar methodologies found in hospitals.
Heart Risk Warner is unique as it employs multiple medical methods and assesses the risk of your heart. It is rather small and lightweight so you can have it in your pocket.
Using this device you can benefit of knowing about possible heart risk existence and prevent future heart risk. Risk of possible heart disease or heart problems like stroke, coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure or heart attack, they are main disorders of the heart and blood vessels.
Main features of Heart Risk Warner or what it can do:


After university project, it took a long time to build this device, which can finally give reliable readings of vital signs. However, to increase accuracy of algorithm and create more sophisticated software we started looking for funding. That is how we came to Indiegogo. Your funding can help a lot. We can continue work on practical tests and algorithm improvements. With enough funding, we can move our software from a desktop to a Smartphone application. In exchange for your contribution, we offer you the best our prototype version.
Our perks for Indiegogo contributors



 
Why is it important? 
Today in world the heart disease is one of the major cause of death. For example, risk of having a stroke doubles every decade and after the age of 55 the risk grows advancing in age (WHO). Several studies showed that many people are unaware about their health condition and are not diagnosed until their deaths. It is projected that in the next half of this century elderly population will be growing more rapid than ever before. This indicates that heart problems will be more and more topical than today.


Cardiovascular diseases are the one of the largest worldwide killer among men, woman and not dependent on the race (see figure bellow). 
Hypertension (or high blood pressure), coronary artery disease, arrhythmias are consequences, which will later can evolve to serious health injuries such as heart attack, stroke or sudden death. At the early stages sometimes it is difficult to measure and diagnose health state, because it is not easy observable. For instance hypertension sometimes called “silent killer”, symptoms are not appreciable in early stages until it develops to serious health risk. Likewise arrhythmias sometimes are difficult to measure, if they occur in short time of periods. Therefore, leading causes of chronic diseases often bring enormous harm to state of health, as well as economically it is disadvantageous.
When you get sick, most likely that the first thing you are doing is checking your body temperature. Temperature measurements sometimes are not informative and can be limited to some aspects. Therefore, Heart Risk Warner extends functionality and allows you to get more information such as heart rate, arrhythmia detection, heart rate variability, blood pressure, stiffness index. Thus, you are given extensive information focused on your heart, i.e. the function of the heart and prediction of future heart risk.

For continuous vascular system estimation we selected photoplethysmography, electrocardiography, accelerometers and others technologies. Combination of different technologies allows us to apply more medical methods. That gives important vital signs what are key elements for the heart risk estimation. 
How does it work
During research there wasn't found a single heart risk assessment algorithm, comprised of multiple medical methods. We found the most relevant methods and connected them together. We created simple rule based algorithm structure as a voting system, with separate nodes and defined coefficient values expressed as a risk weight. Coefficient values selected with significance order, and total heart risk calculated by the sum of all coefficients. 
With existing sensors we connected medical methods into a single algorithm. Major methods shown below:
1) Electrocardiography. It is the significant mean for the proper heart diagnosis such as myocardial infarction, ischemia, and, etc. Heart disease or heart deterioration could be referred to particular type of arrhythmia. However, ECG interpretation and diagnosis requires experienced knowledge. However existing software algorithms referring to the problem can work with accuracy up to 98 or 99%. Making to believe that machines can do a really good job for us. 

                                    



2) Continuous blood pressure estimation using novel techniques. We selected combination of few techniques to do this job. One of them is a well know blood pressure estimation from a pulse transit time. Measurements performed from peripheral PPG wave and ECG R wave.
Blood pressure acts an important role to track your health state. According to American Heart Association (AHA) or Yale University School of medicine heart book, resting blood pressure can be classified into cardiovascular risk groups with recommended activities. Correct blood pressure  estimation can be significant cardiovascular risk prevention.
      
3) Heart rate and heart rate variability. We check your every heart beat and calculate  your  heart rate giving you information is it normal or not. Framingham study showed that increased resting heart rate has an significant correlation with cardiovascular diseases and coronary heart diseases, which are leading cause to the increased mortality rates. Maximal physical capacity can be expressed with maximal heart rate, which is important in a proper rehabilitation, physical activity and disease prevention programs. For instance, in some clinical settings, physical activity is stopped when the subject reaches 85% of his maximal heart rate. More about read here >

                                       
4) Stiffness index. Using second sensor we get more data and we are trying to do more analysis about your heart. Stiffen arteries usually is the consequence of age or atherosclerosis, which is the cause to develop myocardial infarction or stroke; therefore, arterial stiffness index is a good myocardial infarction or stroke predictor. Derived data from pulse wave analysis can detect a patient who has coronary artery disease or hypertension.
                             
5) Activity and temperature sensors also are an important algorithm elements that help to improve overall risk estimation but as well it is important to those who are classified to NYHA and want to know and limit their physical activities.
Risk assessment
To get the risk assessment and other parameters, you need to place one or two sensors and wait for 15 - 25 seconds. To more extensive information we recommend to use device for a longer period of times. For example, if you want to catch arrhythmias which are sometimes difficult to observe. 
You can track the risk using our software. To make it more friendly many complex things are hidden. However, if you want you find more details using graphical view (advanced button). 
                           







PPG/ECG feature extraction
Bellow are video showing feature extraction algorithm of PPG/ECG waves. Signals were first recorded into microSD card. Features are marked with blue and red dots. 




Some samples
Currently we are still developing software algorithm and trying to make it more easy to use. Here we are showing how device is working in a real time. You can see that it is connected over USB and gives real time readings. However it also has Bluetooth and micro SD. What allows to store data internally or send it wirelessly. 



First subject is a healthy male, aged 27 with before never known heart problems. Vital signs such as heart beats, blood pressure, stiffness index, etc are shown in a risk assessment report (picture bellow). Heart risk is not detected normal.

                                                              
  



  

Another subject is a young healthy female without previously known heart problems. The single case that she has was a high blood pressure during pregnancy. During experiment she felt good. Heart risk haven't been detected. 





                  
Rita is 73 female with previously known heart problems. Her diagnosed ischemic heart disease and sometimes she experiences tachycardia (while pulse increases over 100 bpm). During experiment software detected some arrhythmic beats that’s why she was classified to MID-HIGH risk group. At the moment she feels normal. However, for more extensive information we suggest her to have device for a longer period of time.


                         

Algis is 71 years old male without previously known serious heart problems. During experiment he was classified into MID risk group due high systolic blood pressure and increased stiffness index. Sometime he experiences high blood pressure.



Sensor placement

Pictures bellow shows how to place ECG electrodes to the chest (left picture). Place PPG sensor to your left hand finger (middle picture). And then plug sensors into device (right picture).
Design
Instead of plastic materials, we have chosen natural wood. A handmade wooden case design makes every Heart Risk Warner unique. We believe wood is something warm and beautiful. Size is approx 28 x 55 x 78 mm (or 1.1 x 2.2 x 3.1 inch.), and weight is approx 182 grams (0.401 lbs). As it is small and lightweight, you will be able to take it everywhere and you even will not feel that you have it.

Development

You can re-use the board for your own project. It is up to you what tools you prefer to use. At the beginning we used several boards that can work for this project. We used LPCXpresso  board and tools developed by Embedded Artists, they are easy to start and use. LPC-Link is an extensible, stand-alone debug adapter that can be configured to support various development tools and IDEs by downloadable firmwares, it  allows easily to re-program and debug Heart Risk Warner device. We are planning to give you firmware drivers ready to write your own application.

<p>It has been an amazing journey so far and now that we have reached this therapy goal I'm excited about the prospect of getting Q even more care than we had hoped. Going over our goal amount means we can easily afford another meeting with his homeopathic doctor and additional treatments that we were unable to pursue previously. Q says thanks. </p>
<h3>Quinan Benaiah Paraiso</h3>
<p>His name means strength, from it's Gaelic roots, and Benaiah was a leader of mighty men in the time of kings.  Little did we know how incredibly strong he would be.  Even before he was conceived, I dreamed of talking with my little man and the funny kid things he would say.  Along with the silly kid questions and comments little ones make, talking was the thing about being a mom that I most looked forward to. Quinan is 4, and he has barely ever called me ""Mama"". His language is more like a 2-year-old. There's certain words he can say, but he is not processing words or communicating effectively.  When all is said and done, all I really want is for my baby to call me Mama... and Daddy too. Yet this therapy will accomplish much more!</p>
<p><strong>Q's Delays</strong></p>
<p>Quinan has had delays from the start. He has a slew of loose diagnosis, such as - global developmental delay, gross motor delay, fine motor delay, ocular motor apraxia, speech delay, learning disorder, hormonal imbalance, language processing issues, sensory problems, and the list goes on.  Suffice it to say that he is way behind, although he's not mentally disabled. He just has to jump over high hurdles that most 4 year olds don't. He is unique.  His speech is at around 2 year old level. Here's an example: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfMyDg6RtCQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfMyDg6RtCQ</a> </p>
<p><strong>What we've done</strong></p>
<p>We have been through many doctors, and have enjoyed many therapies beginning around 5 months old. Since age 2 we have had Quinan enrolled in Sevick School, a special education school that has been wonderful!  We also have him on natural homeopathic medicine to balance his body and gave him sessions in a hyperbaric chamber to help him grow nuerologically. Alas, the growth of his language is still very stunted, more obvious than any other area of growth. It seems that he has AUDIO PROCESSING DISORDER, it's like Quinan hears us and it sounds like gibberish with some real words mixed in.</p>
<p><strong>Where we're going</strong></p>
<p>The GOOD NEWS - We have found Geni King through the wonderful relationship we have with a holistic health doctor, Dr. Kemyar Hedayat. Geni King works with sound therapy and specializes in audio processing disorder.  She uses the Tomatis Method (described in her website). With one meeting and a few hearing tests, Geni knows that she can help Quinan communicate and more!  It's a therapy that has worked on kids like Quinan many many times over! It's a miracle to me that I have finally found someone who KNOWS exactly what I'm dealing with.  There is so much hopelessness involved when you can't talk to your little boy and he can't talk to you.  Geni has given us new hope.  Here is her website and some testimonies:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.kingsvm.com/news.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.kingsvm.com/news.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Geni King says, ""It is very common for kids to literally get pieces of information and they themselves become very clever at trying to fill in the blanks of the chunks of information that they do not get..this too is exhausting, discouraging, and depending on the age, frustrating because THEY know they are not getting the full message.  This is not a hearing issue either, rather a listening one."" </strong></p>
<p><strong>What we Need</strong></p>
<p>Geni King needs to see him for 30 sessions and her office is over 4 hours round trip from my house.  We are sure this therapy will help Quinan exponentially, but it is way more than we can afford.  With medical bills already taking a toll over the years, my husband being out of work for three months, plus a new baby, our resources are tapped out.  We need your help.  I've included all the session costs, the cost of gas, and cost of indiegogo fees in the funding goal. Being a stay at home mom I can drive Quinan to and from his appointments, but I also have my sister in town to help drive. If I don't reach the entire goal, or if we go over the goal, the funds will still go towards Quinan's medical expenses and therapies.  Please, help give Quinan a voice!</p>
<p><strong>What we'll accomplish</strong></p>
<p>This therapy should help Quinan with all of his delays, in some capacity.  The sooner we can start therapy the sooner Quinan will reap the benefits! I wish we could start IMMEDIATELY, but we don't have the money.  We even found out during our first appointment with Geni, that Quinan IS getting input from his left ear! That is an amazing discovery as all prior tests from other sources showed profound hearing loss in that ear (laymans terms: he was considered deaf in his left ear, but he's not!) Your donation will contribute to these likely outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quinan will be hearing out of his Left ear, that was considered deaf.</li>
<li>Quinan will be able to communicate with us in a 4-year-old manner</li>
<li>Quinan will have improved balance and coordination</li>
<li>He will have an easier time distiguishing sounds and processing them</li>
<li>His capability to learn will grow</li>
<li>His attention and behavior issues will improve</li>
<li>The frustration and stress for Mama and Daddy will greatly reduce</li>
<li>Quinan will be safer </li>
<li>We will all be a happier family</li>
<li>I can imagine the miracle of Quinan responding to his name!</li>
<li>I can imagine him responding when people say, ""What is your name?"" ""How old are you?"" or even ""Please, don't ...""</li>
<li>I hope he will be able to communicate original thoughts and be more connected with us in that way. </li>
</ul><p>I would love to hear from you, a supportive note is as valuable to me as gold these days.  Thank you, generous masses, for your support even in a thought or a prayer.</p>

Dear Friends and Loved Ones,
It was nearly 5 months ago when doctors advised me that I had stomach
cancer and less than four weeks to live.   They were wrong in
part of their diagnosis.  My doctors did not take into account the power
of prayers and the power of love from the thousands of my friends, fans and
family.  It is because of your love, your prayers and your generosity that
I am still alive today.
 
After nearly three months of intensive and sometimes painful treatment in
Germany the cancer seems to be under control.  However there remains the
possibility that the cancer may return and as such I am continuing to receive
treatment, both traditional and holistic - alternative here in San
Francisco.  If all goes well, I may spend the winter months in India to
continue receiving cost effective alternative treatments while staying close to
friends and families.  
 
You all donated nearly $75,000 to fund my medical treatment.  Live
fundraising concerts were held to raise additional monies.
In a month, with the help of my record label Six Degrees Records, we will
be releasing a downloadable compilation that features original, new, never
published tracks from artist friends such as Ustad Zakir Hussain, Pandit G.S. Sachdev, Natacha Atlas,
Karsh Kale, Nitin Sawhney, Midival Punditz, Kailash Kher, Azam Ali, Simon
Shaheen, Bombay Dub Orchestra, Cheb Mami, Steve Shehan, Amina, Mercan Dede, Transglobal
Underground, Freq Nasty & David Starfire, Emam, Jai Uttal, Riffat Sultana, Janaka Selekta, Opium, Watcha Clan. All proceeds from this compilation shall be donated to fund my
continued medical treatment.
For those of you who would like
to donate through PayPal, you may do so to my email address: chebisabbah@chebisabbah.com
 
I don't think I can adequately express my thanks and love to you all. 
I lived long enough to come back to my home and favorite city: San Francisco. I
lived long enough to see the birth of my granddaughter, Rachel and with your
continued love, prayers and support I will live long enough to share new music
with you and to see you all on the dancefloor. 
 
I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
 
Love & Light

-------   UPDATE AS OF JUNE 29, 2011 ------

Chebiji is currently undergoing  treatment and posted a message in the ""updates"" section of this campaign.  

Thank you for your love and blessings.


 -------   UPDATE AS OF JUNE 20, 2011 ------

With your incredible support we achieved our initial goal of raising $25,000  for Chebiji's Cancer Treatment Fund.   PLEASE keep donating to help us defray the massive costs of Chebiji's on going medical treatment.  The campaign will remain active until August 15, 2011.  

On behalf of Chebiji, we thank you all for your blessings, generosity and kindness.

OUR STORY
 
Musical pioneer
Cheb i Sabbah
was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 stomach cancer.  He was advised that the cancer was spreading to his liver and left lung and that time was not on his side.    Like many Americans, “Chebiji” - as he is affectionately known –
does not have health insurance.  Due to his weak health condition, Chebiji
found himself having to cancel live shows, meaning his income stream has come
to a complete halt, with mounting medical bills and future medical costs ahead.  
 
Upon
learning of his condition, a few close friends and artists have come together
to rally around Chebiji and assist him with his fight.  Devastated by the
news and outraged that an artist of Chebiji’s caliber cannot afford to care for
himself and receive the proper urgent medical treatment needed, we have set up
a fund to help.
THE IMPACT
 
Sabbah’s influence
on the global electronic music and DJ scene cannot be over estimated. He has
shown two entire generations that classical world traditions can blend beautifully
and respectfully with DJ Culture.  Thousands
have experienced his music and artistic vision through his many albums and on
his dance floors – whether in Goa, Essaouira, Moscow or at
Nickie’s, where he ran an eighteen year San Francisco weekly residence, we know
what a beautiful gift Chebiji has been to the world at large. This is our
opportunity to give something back to Cheb i Sabbah in his time of need    
 
WHAT WE NEED
We have identified a cancer clinic
in Germany that is ideally suited for Chebiji’s condition and age.  We estimate a treatment and recovery
period of one year during which time Chebiji will be unable to work. 
Our conservative projected costs for his treatment and household
expenses during the treatment and recovery period is at least $45,000 but in all likelihood, considerably more. We hope to raise monies through private donations, benefit shows and benefit albums/remix
albums.  In addition, we turn Chebiji's friends and fans to help us raise at least $25,000.   The breakdown of monies needed is as follows:
1.            
Cancer Treatment inclusive of airfare and lodging:     Minimum: $27,000
2.            
One Year of Fixed
Expenses (Rent/Storage/Electric ): $18,000


Please note that our estimated cost of $45,000 only the minimum projected cost of Chebiji's cancer treatment.  There may be unanticipated costs incurred during his treatment so please donate generously.

HOW ELSE
YOU CAN HELP
We ask all of Chebij’s friends and fans to help spread the
word about his condition via all social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook).

<p>Hello and Good Day,
</p>
<p>   <strong>SIMPLY PUT: I, URGENTLY NEED YOUR HELP !!</strong>
</p>
<p> I am Cherie (USMC), I spent many, many years serving this Great United States of America as a member of thee United States Marine Corps. While serving over seas, My left leg was ""severely damaged"" requiring re-construction and multiple surgeries resulting in, but not limited to, severed nerves, loss of use and the leg is 3 inches shorter. Shortly thereafter (as My health was declining), I was diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (I am required to self-inject Interferon and take Morphine for pain) both extremely expensive medications. I began losing the use of My fingers, hands, good leg and foot. 
</p>
<p><strong>                              ** I am NO longer able to work**</strong> 
</p>
<p>    A new medical device came along and I volunteered to participate and a ""SPINAL CORD IMPLANT"" which wires are connected from the spinal cord to the brain  and wires that attach to a control device that is under the skin just above My left butt cheek. Approximately 8 months or so ago I was diagnosed with Pharyngeal Cancer, which was recently ""confirmed"" and treatment implemented . Needless to say, I have had to endure many surgeries, doctor appointments, hospital stays, recovery, therapy and the like.
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><strong>I just had to ask: How and why has this happened ? I truly believe that, ""God only brings to You the things He knows You can handle."" Also, ""There is a reason for Everything.""</strong>
</p>
<p><strong></strong> 
</p>
<p>    After I was diagnosed with Cancer, I was scheduled for an an appointment  in San Fransisco (400 miles from where I live) and ended up staying. I returned to My house and discovered My truck and bike were not there and upon entering, discovered the house ransacked and the back door wide open.
</p>
<p>    All - in - all, My bank account was drained, a check was written for $2954.00 (there were NO funds to cover it and an arrest warrant was issued to Me). Because ALL of My bills are on ""auto-pay"" NONE of them were paid I accumulated $827.00 in ""overdraft fees"" and last but not least, I was given notification to vacate My home and pay $3300.00 in back payments and an additional $1700.00 in legal fees. This was accompanied by a notice ""REQUEST IMMEDIATE ENTRANCE TO DWELLING FOR ABANDONMENT INVESTIGATION"" all of My utilities were shut off.
</p>
<p>    My doctors called last week to advise Me that I am getting sick ""QUITE RAPIDLY"". I now have no vehicle (appointments 2 or 3 times a week being missed) and have no where to put any of My belongings as of 01OCT13 - I will be homeless (by order) My vehicles were found and placed in impound @ $386.00 tow and $40.00 per day at a total of $1700.00 just to get them released $30.00 for the Police reports.

   SIMPLY PUT: I, URGENTLY NEED YOUR HELP !!

 I am Cherie (USMC), I spent many, many years serving this Great United States of America as a member of thee United States Marine Corps. While serving over seas, My left leg was ""severely damaged"" requiring re-construction and multiple surgeries resulting in, but not limited to, severed nerves, loss of use and the leg is 3 inches shorter. Shortly thereafter (as My health was declining), I was diagnosed with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (I am required to self-inject Interferon and take Morphine for pain) both extremely expensive medications. I began losing the use of My fingers, hands, good leg and foot. 

                              ** I am NO longer able to work** 

    A new medical device came along and I volunteered to participate and a ""SPINAL CORD IMPLANT"" which wires are connected from the spinal cord to the brain  and wires that attach to a control device that is under the skin just above My left butt cheek. Approximately 8 months or so ago I was diagnosed with Pharyngeal Cancer, which was recently ""confirmed"" and treatment implemented . Needless to say, I have had to endure many surgeries, doctor appointments, hospital stays, recovery, therapy and the like.

 

I just had to ask: How and why has this happened ? I truly believe that, ""God only brings to You the things He knows You can handle."" Also, ""There is a reason for Everything.""

 

    After I was diagnosed with Cancer, I was scheduled for an an appointment  in San Fransisco (400 miles from where I live) and ended up staying. I returned to My house and discovered My truck and bike were not there and upon entering, discovered the house ransacked and the back door wide open.

    All - in - all, My bank account was drained, a check was written for $2954.00 (there were NO funds to cover it and an arrest warrant was issued to Me). Because ALL of My bills are on ""auto-pay"" NONE of them were paid I accumulated $827.00 in ""overdraft fees"" and last but not least, I was given notification to vacate My home and pay $3300.00 in back payments and an additional $1700.00 in legal fees. This was accompanied by a notice ""REQUEST IMMEDIATE ENTRANCE TO DWELLING FOR ABANDONMENT INVESTIGATION"" all of My utilities were shut off.

    My doctors called last week to advise Me that I am getting sick ""QUITE RAPIDLY"". I now have no vehicle (appointments 2 or 3 times a week being missed) and have no where to put any of My belongings as of 01OCT13 - I will be homeless (by order) My vehicles were found and placed in impound @ $386.00 tow and $40.00 per day at a total of $1700.00 just to get them released $30.00 for the Police reports. I have tried the Military, VA, several Banks, even people that owe Me money to ABSOLUTELY no avail !! My bank has frozen My account until AFTER the investigation has been completed.

    Bottom line: I am getting getting sicker and I AM NOT A QUITTER !! I have managed to ""get by"" on $130.00 for the past month and ALL I want to do is eliminate the stress attached with My situation (which above all ""stress is one of the worst attributes that contribute to Relapsing/Remitting MS"") I want My HOME, vehicle (s), savings, jewelry, weapons, coins and collectibles back. I want to live out the rest of My life with the things ""I WORKED SO HARD, FOR MANY YEARS, TO HAVE and DESERVE"".

 I am definitely:

<p>For some of you who may not know us, my name is Jennifier and my husband’s name is Kevin. We have been together for 18 years, and have 2 beautiful daughters, Malani age 8 and Aysia age 3. We would like to ask for your help. 3 ½ years ago Kevin’s kidneys were functing at 3% and he started dialysis 3 days a week, 4 hours each day.</p>
<p>We immediately started the process of getting on the transplant list at Oschners Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana. The average wait time for a kidney in the United States is 4-6 years.</p>
<p> We have been waiting over 3 years for that one phone call from Oschners  that says, “Come now, we have a kidney for you”. But that has not happened yet.</p>
<p>However, we did get a phone call from Kevin’s nephew, David, who said, “Uncle Kevin, I would like to try and give you a kidney”.</p>
<p>That phone call was 4 months ago and we have found out that David is a perfect match.  Having waited so long for a match with no prospects, it was truly a blessing to discover that not only was David willing to give Kevin a kidney but by God’s grace, that he is a perfect match.  This kidney will allow Kevin the life he had before dialysis</p>
<p>And now, a date has been set.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Surgery is scheduled for June 17<sup>th</sup>, 2013. </span></strong></p>
<p>Kevin and I need your help.</p>
<p>There are 3 expenses we are raising money for. Housing in New Orleans for 5 weeks, 1 antifungal medication that insurance does not cover, and for me to take as much time off work as needed to be with my husband while he recovers from the surgery.</p>
<p>1. We need to stay in New Orleans up to 5 weeks after the surgery so Kevin can go back and forth to the hospital every day/ several times a day for lab work. This is to monitor his new kidney and how it is functioning.</p>
<p>2. The antifungal medication is priced at $1100 per month. (Unfortunately the insurance does not cover this medication, although it is necessary.) Kevin needs to take this medication for 3-12 months after the surgery. Oschners has informed us that we can get financial assistance for up to 75% of the cost, but that still leaves us with at least $275 per month for 3-12 months. And this is on top of all other co-pays for the other medication he will need to take.</p>
<p>3. In a perfect world I would like to take all 5 weeks off from work, but I only have 5 days of vacation. So I will definitely have to take time off with out pay. I am thankful that my job is willing to work with me during this time and with help from our family and friends, I will be able to be with my husband during his recovery.</p>
<p>We are so grateful and blessed to have so many friends and family to help us to raise the money needed for these expenses not covered by insurance.  Those of you closest to us know how difficult it has been for Kevin these past three years on dialysis.  He has been prayerful and God has given him the strength to endure this cross.  He has never given up hope and has worked hard to be positive and to still give back when he can.  He continues to work with our kids in the Acadiana area and the athletes he has given his time to train, have becomevery successful.</p>
<p>Please share our story with all family and friends. Together we can do it!</p>
<p>We love you all and thank you so much for helping us.  Keep us in your prayers.</p>

<h3>Secret Behind Our Innovative Brewing Mechanism</h3>
<p>Our Leaf Tea Maker is based on our innovative brewing mechanism we invented and is patent pending. This unique circulative brewing mechanism directs heated water at the right temperature over the tea leaves to let them fully expand and release the tea essence at the optimal brewing settings.</p>
<p>The beauty of our innovation is that it<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong> does not use a water pump or mechanical agitator to create the necessary water flow</strong></span>. Also, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>all parts coming in contact with water are fully accessible and washable.</strong></span></p>
<p>Not only does our innovation drastically improve product reliability, but it also enhances cleanibility and overall hygiene.</p>
<p>Our Leaf Tea Maker is also <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">able to brew tea more efficiently and extract more tea essence out of tea leaves</span> </strong>under the same water temperature and brewing time settings in comparison with traditional brewing methods (i.e. water kettle and tea pot).   </p>
<p><img alt=""Traditional vs Tea Maker"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.keyway-innovations.com/images/Traditional_Vs_Tea_Maker_3_Tea_Types.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Traditional vs Tea Maker""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like having delicious <strong>Hong Kong style milk tea</strong> or <strong>Taiwanese bubble tea</strong>? Want to try making it yourself? But it is just too much of a hassle to make it at home and doesn't taste good anyway because traditional brewing methods can't produce strong enough tasting tea to blend well with the milk. </p>
<p>On the other hand, buying them from a shop or in pre-mixed form leaves you no control on (God knows!) what ingredients they put in your drink.</p>
<p>But with our Leaf Tea Maker and its innovative brewing mechanism, making your own favourite milk tea at home would be a breeze. We treat ourselves with making our own HK-style milk tea and other delicious tea drinks using our working prototypes every day and <strong>we just can't get enough of them!!!</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""HK-Style Milk Tea"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.keyway-innovations.com/images/HK_Style_Milk_Tea.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""HK-Style Milk Tea""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides traditional Chinese tea types and various kinds of milk tea, the brewing settings are fully customizable according to your preference. So feel free to experiment with your favourite recipes using our Leaf Tea Maker!</p>
<p><img alt=""Leaf - Brewing Settings"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.keyway-innovations.com/images/Brewing_Settings_English.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Leaf - Brewing Settings""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While the core technical aspects are protected by worldwide patent applications, we would like to wait and reveal<strong> the full secrets of our innovative brewing mechanism </strong>to you only when we approach actual market launch. We are sure you will be surprised at the simplicity and hidden gems of our innovation then!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Project Background and Outlook</h3>
</div>
<p>Our journey began in 2010 as an internal research project at a Fortune 500 company.  After over 2 years of market research and technology development, our team has successfully developed a truly innovative tea maker, first of its kind in the world.</p>
<p>To further realize our invention's business potential, our team founded Keyway Innovations in 2012 and secured a licensing arrangement to bring this innovative tea maker to market with our own added innovations.</p>
<p>We are currently based in both Hong Kong and Shanghai, and our team consists of dedicated multinational professionals who are passionate about tea.</p>
<p><img alt=""Our Team"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.keyway-innovations.com/images/Cheers_Small.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Our Team""/></p>
<div><em>Our core team (from left) Karen, Rick, Macho and Nicolas.</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>The key enabling technologies and product architecture are ready and have been successfully implemented in the latest product prototypes.  We are working hard to <strong>launch it on the market within 1 year</strong>.</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Funding Arrangement &amp; Perks</h3>
<p>Our current funding target is USD $300,000, which would cover the costs for:</p>
<ul>
<li>End product design (mechanical, electronics, industrial, software)</li>
<li>Prototyping &amp; tooling</li>
<li>Testing &amp; safety certification (e.g. IEC, CCC, CE, UL)</li>
<li>Material and components </li>
<li>Manufacturing &amp; quality control</li>
</ul>
<p>We are currently collaborating closely with established manufacturers and component suppliers to jointly develop and commercialize our Leaf Tea Maker.</p>
<p>Being the first product of its kind in the world, <strong>the startup and associated costs for our Leaf Tea Maker are relatively high</strong>. And we need to pass all the necessary household appliance safety tests and approbation procedures to ensure the utmost product safety for you (and us as well!). </p>
<p><strong>But our hard work combined with your support will together make the launch of the Leaf Tea Maker on the market a reality!!!</strong></p>
<p>From now to the final end product design, we estimate it would take 2 to 3 rounds of intermediate prototype design and refinement process, each lasting about 2-3 months. Then it would take about 6-8 months to go through the mass production stage. Therefore we aim to complete the entire product commercialization process within 1 year.</p>
<p><img alt=""Leaf Prototypes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.keyway-innovations.com/images/Prototypes_Small.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Leaf Prototypes""/></p>
<div>Your contribution will help us put together our final end product with an attractive look and global user experience. Your support will also allow us to take care of every design detail so that you will truly enjoy the brewing process with our Leaf Tea Maker.</div>

Leaf in the Press:
Trend Monitor - Crowdfunding Spotlight: Leaf – The Cleverly Innovative Tea Maker
Ayudos - Keyway Innovations Introduces Leaf Tea Maker on Indiegogo
SBWire - Keyway Innovations Introduces Leaf Tea Maker on Indiegogo
 


Don't forget to visit our Facebook page and follow us on Twitter for more information about the Leaf Tea Maker!
 

     

 
Enjoy Our Cleverly Innovative Brewing Experience!

 
Making tea seems easy, but making good tea is not!
 
The core technology in our Leaf Tea Maker is a unique circulative brewing system that can optimally control all 4 of the key brewing elements.


 
Here is the brief product spec for the Leaf Tea Maker:

Leaf Tea Maker comes in Standard and Full-Featured Versions, each equipped with many convenient features to greatly enhance your brewing experience.

 
 


So no matter what type of tea you want to make, you will enjoy great tasting tea and unique brewing experience EVERY TIME with our Leaf Tea Maker!


 




Secret Behind Our Innovative Brewing Mechanism
Our Leaf Tea Maker is based on our innovative brewing mechanism we invented and is patent pending. This unique circulative brewing mechanism directs heated water at the right temperature over the tea leaves to let them fully expand and release the tea essence at the optimal brewing settings.
The beauty of our innovation is that it does not use a water pump or mechanical agitator to create the necessary water flow. Also, all parts coming in contact with water are fully accessible and washable.
Not only does our innovation drastically improve product reliability, but it also enhances cleanibility and overall hygiene.
Our Leaf Tea Maker is also able to brew tea more efficiently and extract more tea essence out of tea leaves under the same water temperature and brewing time settings in comparison with traditional brewing methods (i.e. water kettle and tea pot).   

 
Like having delicious Hong Kong style milk tea or Taiwanese bubble tea? Want to try making it yourself? But it is just too much of a hassle to make it at home and doesn't taste good anyway because traditional brewing methods can't produce strong enough tasting tea to blend well with the milk. 
On the other hand, buying them from a shop or in pre-mixed form leaves you no control on (God knows!) what ingredients they put in your drink.
But with our Leaf Tea Maker and its innovative brewing mechanism, making your own favourite milk tea at home would be a breeze. We treat ourselves with making our own HK-style milk tea and other delicious tea drinks using our working prototypes every day and we just can't get enough of them!!!

 
Besides traditional Chinese tea types and various kinds of milk tea, the brewing settings are fully customizable according to your preference. So feel free to experiment with your favourite recipes using our Leaf Tea Maker!

 
While the core technical aspects are protected by worldwide patent applications, we would like to wait and reveal the full secrets of our innovative brewing mechanism to you only when we approach actual market launch. We are sure you will be surprised at the simplicity and hidden gems of our innovation then!
 
Project Background and Outlook

Our journey began in 2010 as an internal research project at a Fortune 500 company.  After over 2 years of market research and technology development, our team has successfully developed a truly innovative tea maker, first of its kind in the world.
To further realize our invention's business potential, our team founded Keyway Innovations in 2012 and secured a licensing arrangement to bring this innovative tea maker to market with our own added innovations.
We are currently based in both Hong Kong and Shanghai, and our team consists of dedicated multinational professionals who are passionate about tea.

Our core team (from left) Karen, Rick, Macho and Nicolas.
 

The key enabling technologies and product architecture are ready and have been successfully implemented in the latest product prototypes.  We are working hard to launch it on the market within 1 year.
 



Funding Arrangement & Perks
Our current funding target is USD $300,000, which would cover the costs for:

End product design (mechanical, electronics, industrial, software)
Prototyping & tooling
Testing & safety certification (e.g. IEC, CCC, CE, UL)
Material and components 
Manufacturing & quality control

We are currently collaborating closely with established manufacturers and component suppliers to jointly develop and commercialize our Leaf Tea Maker.
Being the first product of its kind in the world, the startup and associated costs for our Leaf Tea Maker are relatively high. And we need to pass all the necessary household appliance safety tests and approbation procedures to ensure the utmost product safety for you (and us as well!). 
But our hard work combined with your support will together make the launch of the Leaf Tea Maker on the market a reality!!!
From now to the final end product design, we estimate it would take 2 to 3 rounds of intermediate prototype design and refinement process, each lasting about 2-3 months. Then it would take about 6-8 months to go through the mass production stage. Therefore we aim to complete the entire product commercialization process within 1 year.

Your contribution will help us put together our final end product with an attractive look and global user experience. Your support will also allow us to take care of every design detail so that you will truly enjoy the brewing process with our Leaf Tea Maker.

<div>Grace was born in Ghana ,West Africa in June 2003, and came home to live with us in 2008. We were told then that she had suffered a serious illness as a baby and had the will and strength to overcome it, therefore her African name Adom, meaning Grace was more than fitting. Our wonderful doctor listened to Mariama tell the story of her sickness and noting a twenty percent hearing loss in her right ear deduced that she had probably suffered from cerebral malaria as a baby. According to Mariama she was a fat little baby but came to us as a twenty five pound five year old with knobby knees and a crooked little walk. Now she is a 4'5"" of solid muscle and pure joy to all who know her.</div>
<p>When we put Grace in gymnastics two years ago, she started in a weekly recreational class. Two months later she had advanced all the way to team and costs as one might assume, escalated. Being a photographer I love to barter when I can and one was put into place with Grace's gym.  I was able to shoot rec pictures  for them and defer some of the cost over the past two years, but the big barter wasn't to take place until this September. In late July, Shawn and I discussed it and decided that it was time to change gyms. We realized that Grace had a gift for gymnastics and now was the time to put all efforts toward the big picture and place her in a gym that would help her move toward winning a college scholarship or maybe  achieve every little gymnast's dream, to one day compete in the Olympics. So we drained the savings and found money under the couch and sold items in the basement, to settle up with her gym. </p>
<p>We did our research and found a good match for Grace, but we are coming in right at the beginning of competition season with registration fees, uniform costs, USAG fees, higher monthly fees because of a new level etc. and even though this gym fundraises for it's competition fees (which we love )we have missed the first fundraiser. So we plan on doing the monthly selling  of Krispy Kreme doughnuts and smart cards and lemonade stands all things that grandparents and friends  and neighborhoods get hit up to buy! We are so grateful to have that for the future, but this fundraiser will allow Grace to compete this season and not miss out on a much needed year of competition. All the funds raised will go directly to her new gym to get us headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>I can't tell you how exciting it is to watch her train this past week and learn new skills and just get that fresh start. </p>
<p>Being able to offer photography perks and packages at this price is very exciting! <a href=""http://www.robindoddphotography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.robindoddphotography.com</a></p>
<p>I love to put art on the wall of people's homes. That is a fact and I have long ago taken digital packages out of my photography business.  This gives you guys the opportunity to have a mini shoot and also receive  10 digitals. For all the creative types we know, actors, musicians, or families who haven't had a big budget for photography but would love to have photos. In the Yurchenko perk, buy a session and give a friend a chance to receive a free one is a way to pay it forward. If you were thinking of getting photos anyway, nows the time! </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In 2012-13 Grace was the state champ for her age group on floor, beam and bars, she also was all-around champ with just those three events.</p>
<p>Keeping Grace moving forward without a break in training means everything to her success. We have faith in her! and most importantly she loves it and is having a great time!</p>

However, Nathan never let that stop him from riding.  I vividly remember after turning Pro sometime in 93' Nathan Woods had to ride his uncles clapped out 1986 YZ 490.  And this was in 1993!  My goal is to honor Nathan Woods memory (RIP #54) by helping Brandon Ray not suffer the same setbacks.  </p><p>B-Ray will be a champion with the right bike, and we the Motocross community are going to make it happen for him.  John, Brandon's father, is on disability/fixed income, and I can tell you he spends every dime and then some on this kid getting to the track. Quick story, first time I met John, he had me in tears about how badly Brandon wanted it and the sacrifices they make to get to the track.  As I was talking to John, I noticed his belt... or say lack thereof.  He was wearing a bungee cord for a belt...  There is only one thing on this dad's mind - get this kid to the races!  Now lets help these guys out and get him on some good equipment!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We need a 2011-2013 85cc Motocross bike in great condition for the 2014 Season. Brandon expects to qualify for Loretta Lynn's this year on the 85cc machine!  </p><p>The funding will go into Steve Mervau and/or Crytal Kelly's paypal accounts.  When we reach our goal of $3000, Brandon, his father, and I will go purchase the motorcycle together - on video!   I will then do a nice little video about our journey here and also follow Brandon around on the track and get some good footage of him on his new machine!  </p><p>There are many levels of donation and they all help to the goal.   It feels great to give.  So please bring the gift of giving and holiday cheer to this young motocross racer! </p><p>If we don't reach our goal, we will continue to push locally.  Ultimately, the money will go to Brandon's racing in some form.  Weather it be entries, gear, or a new bike.  The money WILL be spent on motocross and motocross only.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The Impact of giving a young boy a motorcycle is unparalleled.  This tangible item gives a child so many intangible things!  Responsibility, courage, and mostly self esteem and pride that today's youth lacks.  Motocross teaches you more about simply riding.  It teaches you about mechanics and life.  So many times kids miss the boat on how a simple thing like tire pressure or an oil change can affect their lives.  It may sound silly, but think for a second.  How many men out there can't change their own oil?  Motocross teaches real life, real world lessons that kids can use today and tomorrow.  Your child will use motocross (and all accompanying lessons that come with it) more than math in the real world.</p><p>I have had recent success in a similar situation where a young boy needed to upgrade his motorcycle to his skill level.  We raised $500 in 3 days!  See it on youtube:  Search ""Little Rodney's New Kx 60 Donated by Nor/Cal MX and Friends""</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/></p><p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn't mean you can’t help!</p><ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about B-Ray and his talent!</li>
<li>Share this campaign on Face Book and at the track!</li>

</ul><p></p><p>And that’s all there is to it.</p><p>YOU can make a difference NOW!</p></div>","Short SummaryMy name is Steve Mervau.  I grew up riding and racing motorcycles with two time WORCS Champion Nathan Woods.   Nathan had some struggles finding motorcycles to race when we were in our teens.   Quiet simply, the funding wasn't there for Nathan. However, Nathan never let that stop him from riding.  I vividly remember after turning Pro sometime in 93' Nathan Woods had to ride his uncles clapped out 1986 YZ 490.  And this was in 1993!  My goal is to honor Nathan Woods memory (RIP #54) by helping Brandon Ray not suffer the same setbacks.  B-Ray will be a champion with the right bike, and we the Motocross community are going to make it happen for him.  John, Brandon's father, is on disability/fixed income, and I can tell you he spends every dime and then some on this kid getting to the track. Quick story, first time I met John, he had me in tears about how badly Brandon wanted it and the sacrifices they make to get to the track.  As I was talking to John, I noticed his belt... or say lack thereof.  He was wearing a bungee cord for a belt...  There is only one thing on this dad's mind - get this kid to the races!  Now lets help these guys out and get him on some good equipment!What We Need & What You GetWe need a 2011-2013 85cc Motocross bike in great condition for the 2014 Season. Brandon expects to qualify for Loretta Lynn's this year on the 85cc machine!  The funding will go into Steve Mervau and/or Crytal Kelly's paypal accounts.  When we reach our goal of $3000, Brandon, his father, and I will go purchase the motorcycle together - on video!   I will then do a nice little video about our journey here and also follow Brandon around on the track and get some good footage of him on his new machine!  There are many levels of donation and they all help to the goal.   It feels great to give.  So please bring the gift of giving and holiday cheer to this young motocross racer! If we don't reach our goal, we will continue to push locally.  Ultimately, the money will go to Brandon's racing in some form.  Weather it be entries, gear, or a new bike.  The money WILL be spent on motocross and motocross only.The ImpactThe Impact of giving a young boy a motorcycle is unparalleled.  This tangible item gives a child so many intangible things!  Responsibility, courage, and mostly self esteem and pride that today's youth lacks.  Motocross teaches you more about simply riding.  It teaches you about mechanics and life.  So many times kids miss the boat on how a simple thing like tire pressure or an oil change can affect their lives.  It may sound silly, but think for a second.  How many men out there can't change their own oil?  Motocross teaches real life, real world lessons that kids can use today and tomorrow.  Your child will use motocross (and all accompanying lessons that come with it) more than math in the real world.I have had recent success in a similar situation where a young boy needed to upgrade his motorcycle to his skill level.  We raised $500 in 3 days!  See it on youtube:  Search ""Little Rodney's New Kx 60 Donated by Nor/Cal MX and Friends""Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can’t contribute, but that doesn't mean you can’t help!
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about B-Ray and his talent!

THE BACKSTORY:
In 2005 Marita was on a school trip to Finland, while
there she was in a snowmobile accident that left her momentarily paralyzed in
her lower body and with severe pain in her back and neck. She was immediately
taken to the local hospital in Finland. There they found a broken disk in her
back (L5), but told her there was nothing serious about it. It would eventually
heal itself…
Two days later they carried her to her plane, and sent
her home. Her neck was never checked!
Marita has not been able to work since then, and now
has a life where she spend most of her time in severe pain in her bed and on the
sofa.WHY WAS MARITA IN PAIN?:
One year ago a
private doctor in Norway found Maritas neck injury. She has atlantoaxial
instability (AAI) also known as cervical instability. 
He used
an ordinary x-ray machine, so the injury should have been found many years ago.
This could finally explain Maritas deteriorating health and the troubles she has
with her central nerve system. 
Before this
Marita had desperately tried everything to get better, but nothing helped since
the real problem was her neck. 
In October 2013

detailed pictures of her neck and back in an Upright MRI. Here they found three
breaks in her back, one so severe that it should have been operated in 2005,
but now it is to late as the bone pieces have grown in the wrong places. You may ask yourself: Doesn’t Norway
have the best healthcare system in the world…?
We thought so to until we knew the truth about Maritas neck injury...

Norway is way
behind in the medical development of cervical instability. Cervical
Instability due to accidents
 is not recognized in the health system in Norway,
even though the World Health Organization (WHO) and many countries recognize it
and sees the danger it leads to.
Marita does not
get help because they cannot discover atlantoaxial instability (AAI) by the X-ray
methods they use here in Norway. In many other countries they discover this
injury because they use dynamic X-ray instead, this is what WHO recommends. *More info in links below. The
Norwegian government has decided in parliamentary decision #484, that Norway should
follow WHO´s guidelines. In reality this guideline is not followed when it
comes to patients suffering from cervical instability.
THE OPERATION COST:
Marita has fallen out of the system and must pay everything herself. We must pay 26.000 US Dollars
just for the operation. This does not include travel expenses, rehabilitation
and medication after the operation.All we want is for Marita to get rid of the nerve pains in her jaw, eyes, teeth, ears, arms and

Mission 
Northside Center for Emotional Wellness will strive to
promote healing for children and families by providing integrative mental
health care. By offering individual, group, and family therapy as well as the
complementary interventions of yoga and mindfulness. 


In my 15 years of working in the field of mental health as a child psychologist, I am struck by the ""blank stares"" I receive when I ask
parents if they are taking care of themselves, or engaging in their own self-care.  When families have a child with mental health needs, their lives often become consumed  by appointments with professionals. They end up
spending much of their week sitting in waiting room after waiting room. At home, they may struggle to manage
symptoms related to their child's diagnoses such as aggression, tantrums and sleep disturbances which often
leave parents with little time or energy to engage in their own self-care. 

Parents can become exhausted and demoralized
caring for a child with mental health issues. We want to provide them with a healing/peaceful space where they can care for themselves as well as their child, and hopefully
have at least a moment of respite. 
We are hoping to support children and families by providing exceptional individual and family therapy at the clinic. As well as yoga and meditation in the studio that will be attached. We also plan to have biofeedback programs and massage available to parents while their child is in session. We are excited to provide this new model for care in a beautiful and welcoming space in
North Minneapolis. Thank you so much for your support so that we in turn, can support children and families.
   What We Need
Funds raised will cover the following: 
Funds to cover the start up costs such as the lease for the first 4-5 months.



Build out costs to help create a beautiful space where children and families can come to heal, grow and learn to manage their mental health conditions.


Bamboo floors in both the mental health offices and yoga studio.


Offices large enough for play therapy and family sessions. 


Furniture, toys and computers.

If we exceed our goals (which I hope we do) funds will go toward a progressive and healing experience, so we will need a unique list of supplies such as:


Biofeedback software and hardware
Weighted blankets
Bungee chairs
Thera-putty and other sensory equipment

The Impact
Our center will be in an economically and culturally diverse area of Minneapolis with higher than average rates of socioeconomic stressors. Consequently, we want to create a unique space where children and families can seek healing in an environment that will merge traditional therapy with holistic approaches to healing  such as yoga and massage.  
Risks & Challenges

Opening a clinic and yoga studio will be lots of work and the initial costs are quite high, but we are passionate about bringing this innovative clinic to North Minneapolis and we are willing to put in the hard work and take the risk.  I have over 15 years of experience working with children and families in the metro area and we will have a therapeutic team rich in experience in treating  autism spectrum disorders, anxiety, depression and other mental health diagnoses.

We are learning and being trained more and more about how body-based interventions such as yoga and meditation help decrease anxiety and help individuals manage symptoms of PTSD, so we are very excited to make it available at our center.

<h3>What's our story?</h3> <p>The uOttawa Quidditch Club was created in January 2011 by Clare Hutchinson and Tegan Bridge, and have recently celebrated our 5th birthday. In past years we have been finalists for the Canada cup, won said cup, attended World Cups, and have competed in numerous tournaments. Last year, some of our players won the first Quidditch Canada national championship. This year our club consists of our main team - the Gee Gees (consisting of mostly veterans of our club) - who are currently #1 in Canada - and our development team: Ottawa Maple Rush (consisting of equally talented new/and returning players). Our Gee Gees have won all their games so far but one, and Maple Rush is coming off their first win. At regionals, both teams are looking to continue their winning streaks. With your help you can help us achieve our goal; and. besides, who wouldn't want to help these smiling faces: </p>

<h3>Challenges and Risks</h3>
<p>The practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT*) to the Golf Industry involves both unique challenges and risk.  To minimize the risk GrowGolf has already developed an initial prototype of the Intelligent Sub Core (ISC*; i.e. brains of the SmartGolfBall) and associated software; however the prototype ISC is too large to fit in the core of a golf ball.  The next two steps in the process are: 1) shrink the ISC to about the size of a pearl; and 2) embed the pearl size prototype ISC in the core of a traditional golf ball resulting in the first prototype SmartGolfBall.</p>
<p>In the coming months we will use much of the acquired funding on the tasks in the initial stages of our Timeline (Phase II) described in more detail below, to complete the development of the ISC* (reduced footprint) and its DigitalCaddie software which in turn <strong>will enable us to complete the development of the prototype SmartGolfBall.</strong></p>
<p>Phase II shows a challenging set of tasks remaining but we are confident that we can meet the timeline deadlines.  However, unexpected delays can occur due to manufacturing issues, component shortages, contract issues and other unforeseen challenges.  Please be patient.</p>
<p>As soon as GrowGolf can schedule production of the prototype SmartGolfBall in sufficient quantities for testing, GrowGolf will publish the availability of dates for the Future Perks described provided there is adequate interest in each perk.</p>
<p>Note that GrowGolf reserves the right to add, change or remove Perks without advance notice and for any reason.  Some of the reasons may relate to consumer demand, consumer interest and/or may be logistical in nature.</p>

<p>The ""Next Steps"" in the SmartGolfBall Development are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>step #1</strong>: shrink the Intelligent Sub-Core (i.e. <strong>ISC</strong>* brains of the SmartGolfBall) to the size of a pearl to fit in the core of the SmartGolfBall without affecting its dynamics.</li>
<li>
<strong>step #2</strong>: produce the 1st operational SmartGolfBall Prototype with ISC* inside and applicable software;</li>
<li>
<strong>step #3</strong>: ramp-up production of the SmartGolfBall Prototype in sufficient quantities for extensive testing. </li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Technology</b></h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Q:</strong>  <strong>What is the technology behind the SmartGolfBall? </strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A:  The ball incorporates micro electronic circuitry that uses GPS and several communication technologies to track the ball’s exact position at all times and relays that information to the golfer.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Q: </strong> <strong>How does the technology affect how the SmartGolfBall feels?  </strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A:  It does not at all. You can’t tell by looking at it or feeling it that the ball has our technology embedded.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Q:</strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>  </span><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>How does the SmartGolfBall play when hit with different clubs?</strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A:   It depends on how you hit your clubs. But seriously, we designed it so that there is no effect on how the ball plays.  The only impact is that the golfer will play faster rounds (no more searching for lost balls!). Aside from that, there is no effect on the way a golfer plays.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">      </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Q:</strong>  <strong>Will the SmartGolfBall last as long as a regular ball?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A:  Yes.  It will last as long as any other ball in your bag<span> of similar </span><span>construction.</span></span></p> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">      </span><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Q:</strong>  <strong>Will the SmartGolfBall fly as far?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A:   Yes. Distance or other performance characteristics will not be affected.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Q: </strong>  <strong>Will the SmartGolfBall feel the same around the greens?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A:   Yes, putting will be the same. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">      </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Q:</strong>   <strong>Is the SmartGolfBall part of a system or architecture for all components of golf?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A:   Yes, <span>when fully implemented, all of the components of golf will be networked together and collective is one embodiment of the golf information systems architecture (gisA) that provides useful golf information to the golfer; similar to what a professional golfer routinely gets from his Caddy, Spotters, Marshalls and other support structure. The SmartGolfBall is just one of the components.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">      </span></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  <strong>Is GrowGolf’s DigitalCaddie invention protected with Intellectual Property?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Yes.  GrowGolf has patent rights for the core technologies of the invention as well as pending patent applications. GrowGolf has plans in place to continue to enhance its patent portfolio with additional patent applications.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">       </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Q:</strong>  <strong>Will putting be the same?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">      </span></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  <strong>Can the SmartGolfBall be used in tournament play?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Initially it will not be used in professional tournaments because the ball will not be on the USGA’s approved ball list.  For all other tournament play, if local club and/or tournament rules approve it, then either the ball could be used in tournament play if the app is turned off/disabled<span> or if local rules approve its outright use.  The design point is that all aspects of the ball will conform to USGA rules and we will diligently seek its placement on the approved USGA ball list. </span></p>
<p><span>      </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Q:</strong> <strong> Can the SmartGolfBall be used in recreational play?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>A:  Yes.  In general local golf club rules do not require a ball to be on the USGA approved ball list before it can be used for recreational play.  The SmartGolfBall is designed to adhere to all USGA standards for placement on the approved ball list.  GrowGolf will submit its ball to the USGA's testing procedures and diligently pursue its placement on the approved ball list. </span></p>
<p><span>      </span></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  <strong>Will the SmartGolfBall be USGA approved?</strong></p>
<p>A:  As with any newly announced ball, Initially it will not be on the USGA approved ball list [for professional tournaments] because the ball must pass a series of rigid USGA lab tests to be placed on the list; however the design point for the ball is that it will adhere to all aspects of the USGA ball standards <span>and we will diligently seek its placement on the approved USGA ball list. </span></p>
<p><span>      </span></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  <strong>How long will the SmartGolfBall last?</strong></p>
<p>A:  It will last as long as any other ball in your bag<span> of similar </span><span>construction.</span></p>
<p><span>      </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Q:  Are there batteries?</span></strong></p>
<p>A:  Yes, there is a rechargeable battery in the ball. It is quickly/easily recharged similar to the way your electric toothbrush is charged when sitting in its holder.</p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  How does the SmartGolfBall impact the way a golfer normally plays?</strong></p>
<p>A:  we designed it so that there is no effect on how the ball plays.</p>
<p>       </p>
<p><strong>Q:  Can I check the SmartGolfBall’s Battery to see if it is functional?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Yes, using your smartphone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:  What will happen when the SmartGolfBall’s battery power runs out?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Your Smartphone will “beep” before you tee-off to warn you that you are at about 20% power, at which point the golfer should start to monitor the ball's charge to ensure that he/she has enough power left to finish any hole started!  If the ball loses power altogether and becomes inoperable then the golfer has the option of following USGA rule 5-3: unfit for play rule, which allows the golfer to substitute a new SmartGolfBall without penalty.</p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  Can the SmartGolfBall’s battery be recharged?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Yes.</p>
<p><span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">      </span></span></p>
<p><strong>Q:  what is the life span of a the SmartGolfBall's battery (meaning how long before the batter cannot retain charge)?</strong></p>
<p>A:  </p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  What certifications will the SmartGolfBall have?</strong></p>
<p>A:  The design point for the SmartGolfBall is that it will be FCC, UL and CE certified.</p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  Will the ISC continue to operate when the SmartGolfBall goes in the water?</strong></p>
<p>A:   Yes; but the strength of the signal will depend on how deep the water is. </p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  Will the dynamics of the SmartGolfBall be affected by the new technology?</strong></p>
<p>A:  No.</p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  What are the SmartGolfBall specs?</strong></p>
<p><span>A: </span> With regard to it's specs, the design point for the SmartGolfBall is that it will conform to all physical requirements for placement on the USGA's approved golf ball list for professional tournaments. Essentially those requirements are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>General: </b>the material and construction of the ball must not be contrary to the purpose and intent of the Rules.</li>
<li><span> <b>Weight: </b>the ball must not weigh more than 1.620 ounces (45.93 gm).</span></li>
<li>
<b>Size: </b>the ball must have a diameter of not less than 1.680 inches (42.67 mm). </li>
<li>
<b>Spherical Symmetry: </b>the ball is designed and manufactured to behave symmetrically.</li>
<li>
<b>Initial Velocity: </b>the speed of the ball off the clubface cannot be greater than 250 ft. per sec.  when struck under predefined lab conditions; i.e. ( fixed force at fixed launch angle, etc.).</li>
<li>
<b>Overall Distance Standard</b>: the distance the ball travels under predefined lab conditions cannot be greater than 317 yards.</li>
</ol>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  Which Smartphones will be supported?  Operating systems supported?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Plans are to initially make it available on the two major types of Smartphones (Androids and iPhones with applicable operating systems).  We will have more detail when we get close to releasing the SmartGolfBall.</p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  How long will it take to fully charge a SmartGolfBall</strong></p>
<p>A:  As with any battery operated device, the time it takes to fully charge the device will depend on the state of its charge when placed in the charger.  The design point for the SmartGolfBall is that it will sit in the ball holder/charging tray when not in use.  The ball holder/charging tray will hold about a dozen balls and will trickle charge the SmartGolfBalls in the tray; so that whenever a ball is needed it will likely be fully charged.  </p>
<p>The design point for the SmartGolfBall is that it should be fully charged about 12 hours if it was completely discharged at the start; however that will have to be verified when the first prototypes are tested.  The ball holder/charging tray can also be plugged-in for charging the SmartGolfBalls overnight.</p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  What is the Warranty on the SmartGolfBall?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Future Perks #10 (Beta Test first SmartGolfBall), #11 (Lessons on DigitalCaddie) and #12 (SmartGolfBall Tournament for 4) use prototype SmartGolfBalls and by the very nature of being prototypes the balls may not be perfect so a standard warranty is not applicable.  Additionally the above referenced Future Perks are an important part of the process of testing the basic features of the SmartGolfBall and in the execution of the Perks, it is expected that some issues may be uncovered which will in turn lead to an improved product.  However it is our intent to provide prototype balls that will be adequate to perform meaningful tests of the basic features of the SmartGolfBall. </p>
<p>Once production SmartGolfBalls are made available for purchase, a standard ball warranty will come with the product which essentially will be that GrowGolf will warranty the product to be free of defects in material and workmanship for one year from the date of original retail purchase, except the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>Damage caused by accident, misuse, abuse, disassembly, unauthorized modification or neglect.</span></li>
<li>Damage resulting from the performance of repairs by someone not authorized by our company</li>
<li><p><span>Damage resulting from failure to follow instructions contained in your instruction manual. </span></p></li>
</ul>        <p><strong>Q:  If a SmartGolfBall loses its charge after the tee-off but before holing out on a given hole, what effect will such an “unfit for play” ball have on the golfer's score?</strong></p>
<p>A:   No effect and no penalty to substitute a working SmartGolfBall!  USGA rule 5-3: unfit for play rule applies; which allows substitution of ""unfit for play"" balls for a working one.</p>

<h4>Features and Benefits</h4>
<div>
<p><strong>Q:  What is one of the key problems facing golf today?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Pace of play! And the SmartGolfBall will help improve the pace of play.</p>
<p><strong>      </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:  What is the major cause for the slow pace of play problem?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Several studies have been done, and most experts agree that pace of play is mostly impacted by lost balls (i.e., time wasted looking for lost balls).     </p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  How will the SmartGolfBall help to grow golf?</strong></p>A:   By improving pace of play, encouraging more people to play (faster rounds). Also with increased course throughput allowing course owners to book more tee times each day (more revenue). Once the architecture is fully <p>implemented across all golf components (gisA), this system will help new golfers by being a “DigitalCaddie and DigitalTrainer”.</p>
<p>      </p>
<p><strong>Q:  Why should I buy the SmartGolfBall rather than my usual brand name ball?</strong></p>
<p>A:  We believe that the technology in the ball will not have a noticeable impact on the dynamics of brand name balls in which it is embedded; therefore our goal is to encourage its placement in all brand name balls. Thereby eliminating your dilemma.  However until the use of the embedded technology becomes widespread, if you purchase our balls which do have embedded technology you can improve your pace of play and gain other valuable information about your golf game.</p>
<p>      </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Q:  Can the SmartGolfBall be used with existing golf equipment?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Yes.</p>

How the Money is Spent
Q & A's
 OverviewIntroducing the world’s first ever truly “SmartGolfBall” that delivers on the promise of “No More Lost Balls”!The purpose of this campaign is to attract enough seed money to complete the prototype development of GrowGolf's SmartGolfBall, which is the first of several products to be released under its patented DigitalCaddie inventionYour support of this development is the first step in the evolution of the DigitalCaddie.  When all the components of golf are fully implemented, Digital Caddie will enable recreational golfer’s access to the same information routinely available to tour golfers through their Caddy, Ball Spotters* and golf course Marshalls; resulting in a faster, easier to learn and more fun filled game. The GrowGolf StoryHello, my name is Julius.  Like many of you, learning to play golf was frustrating.  Even more frustrating is the time wasted searching for lost golf balls or experiencing “slow pace of play” because a foursome ahead is searching for lost golf balls.As an inventor and engineer I thought that we could bring the Internet of Things (IoT*) to the golf industry and solve several problems.  Julius and Carla, two ex-IBM employees who own intellectual property rights for an invention called DigitalCaddie, founded GrowGolf LLC, a startup company to make the invention idea a product reality.  DigitalCaddie’s first featured product planned for release, the SmartGolfBall with associated app will solve the lost ball issue!
 
The short video below describes how GrowGolf's SmartGolfBall will work!

 
Let's take a closer look at the SmartGolfBall.  The SmartGolfBall is a new kind of golf ball; one that connects wirelessly with your smartphone and has a design objective to lead you to within one foot of your golf ball, no matter where it has landed.  
The genius behind The SmartGolfBall is a small microchip that communicates with GPS satellites to relay its location back to your smart phone … the results … “No More Lost Balls!” Our Mission and a Peek into the FutureOur long-term goal, once the DigitalCaddie is fully implemented is to provide the recreational golfer with the same information that a professional golfer routinely has available through his or her Caddy and other support structure.When all the featured products are released and fully implemented as golf's first IoT* and used by recreational golfers, the DigitalCaddie can reduce the average time for a foursome to play 18 holes to under 3.5 hours.In addition to using this amazing technology to quickly locate your ball, you will:
play faster and enjoy more time playing, and less time searching;
consult your DigitalCaddie for suggestions on what club to use; 
augment your golf lessons with immediate feedback from your DigitalTrainer to make golf easier to learn and more fun to practice!
obtain instant guidance from the built in DigitalMarshall on what rule to use; and yes … 
receive putt line suggestions from your DigitalCaddie just like the Pros; and more…
This technology has been proven to work, and we’re working diligently to bring it to you.   Size Matters!The challenge GrowGolf faces today is that our microchip prototype, the brain of the SmartGolfBall which we call the Intelligent Sub-Core (ISC) is the size of a golf ball and it needs to be the size of a pearl – your financial support is needed. Our development team needs your help in bringing the SmartGolfBall to market.  There are plenty of perks to select from on this crowdfunding site.  So please make a donation and choose one … it’s our way of saying thanks for your generous support!  Your donation, regardless of size, will help bring this new IoT* technology to the game of golf.  Here are three (3) ways You can help:

Future Perks
Once GrowGolf: 1) receives enough funding to complete the development of the prototype SmartGolfBall; and 2) an adequate quantity of prototype SmartGolfBalls are scheduled for testing; the following additional Perks will be offered if sufficient interest exists, as our way of saying thanks for your generous support and donations.

    Invitation to ""Beta Test"" Prototypes of the first SmartGolfBalls;
    Offer of Two (2) DigitalCaddie Lessons;
    Opportunity to Play in: First Ever All SmartGolfBall Tournament(s);

 The data gathered from your participation in these ""future"" Perk events will help the GrowGolf team: a) resolve any remaining issues with the SmartGolfBall which are uncovered by such Perk events; b) improve the process of using DigitalCaddie to play, practice and learn golf; and c) perfect the software and its interface to the SmartGolfBall. Thus your participation will help smooth the way to the mass production of the First Ever Truly SmartGolfBall!
______________________________________________
 
Challenges and Risks
The practical application of the Internet of Things (IoT*) to the Golf Industry involves both unique challenges and risk.  To minimize the risk GrowGolf has already developed an initial prototype of the Intelligent Sub Core (ISC*; i.e. brains of the SmartGolfBall) and associated software; however the prototype ISC is too large to fit in the core of a golf ball.  The next two steps in the process are: 1) shrink the ISC to about the size of a pearl; and 2) embed the pearl size prototype ISC in the core of a traditional golf ball resulting in the first prototype SmartGolfBall.
In the coming months we will use much of the acquired funding on the tasks in the initial stages of our Timeline (Phase II) described in more detail below, to complete the development of the ISC* (reduced footprint) and its DigitalCaddie software which in turn will enable us to complete the development of the prototype SmartGolfBall.
Phase II shows a challenging set of tasks remaining but we are confident that we can meet the timeline deadlines.  However, unexpected delays can occur due to manufacturing issues, component shortages, contract issues and other unforeseen challenges.  Please be patient.
As soon as GrowGolf can schedule production of the prototype SmartGolfBall in sufficient quantities for testing, GrowGolf will publish the availability of dates for the Future Perks described provided there is adequate interest in each perk.
Note that GrowGolf reserves the right to add, change or remove Perks without advance notice and for any reason.  Some of the reasons may relate to consumer demand, consumer interest and/or may be logistical in nature.

A:  The ball incorporates micro electronic circuitry that uses GPS and several communication technologies to track the ball’s exact position at all times and relays that information to the golfer.  
 
Q:  How does the technology affect how the SmartGolfBall feels?  
A:  It does not at all. You can’t tell by looking at it or feeling it that the ball has our technology embedded.
 
Q:  How does the SmartGolfBall play when hit with different clubs? 
A:   It depends on how you hit your clubs. But seriously, we designed it so that there is no effect on how the ball plays.  The only impact is that the golfer will play faster rounds (no more searching for lost balls!). Aside from that, there is no effect on the way a golfer plays.
      
Q:  Will the SmartGolfBall last as long as a regular ball?
A:  Yes.  It will last as long as any other ball in your bag of similar construction.       Q:  Will the SmartGolfBall fly as far?
A:   Yes. Distance or other performance characteristics will not be affected.
 
Q:   Will the SmartGolfBall feel the same around the greens?
A:   Yes, putting will be the same. 
      
Q:   Is the SmartGolfBall part of a system or architecture for all components of golf?
A:   Yes, when fully implemented, all of the components of golf will be networked together and collective is one embodiment of the golf information systems architecture (gisA) that provides useful golf information to the golfer; similar to what a professional golfer routinely gets from his Caddy, Spotters, Marshalls and other support structure. The SmartGolfBall is just one of the components.
      
Q:  Is GrowGolf’s DigitalCaddie invention protected with Intellectual Property?
A:  Yes.  GrowGolf has patent rights for the core technologies of the invention as well as pending patent applications. GrowGolf has plans in place to continue to enhance its patent portfolio with additional patent applications.
       
Q:  Will putting be the same?
A:  Yes, putting will be the same.      Q:   How is the SmartGolfBall different from other balls?
 
A:  It is sensor enhanced such that its position and other performance characteristics are seamlessly communicated to the golfer via an app on a smartphone.
      
Q:  What happens when it rains?
A:    Nothing, golf is an outdoor sport (unless they blow the horn when there is a risk of lightning). But seriously, the SmartGolfBall’s performance is not affected by rain.
      
Q:  If I wear a pacemaker can I use the SmartGolfBall?
A:   Yes since the product will meet standard consumer product safety requirements; so if you can safely operate a TV, radio or smartphone you are probably OK; however as with any serious health issue, before engaging in a sport one should check with their doctor.
      
Q:  Can Google Glass be used with the SmartGolfBall?
A:   Our architecture will allow for developers to create apps for the Google Glass. 
      
Q:  Can the SmartGolfBall be used in tournament play?
A:  Initially it will not be used in professional tournaments because the ball will not be on the USGA’s approved ball list.  For all other tournament play, if local club and/or tournament rules approve it, then either the ball could be used in tournament play if the app is turned off/disabled or if local rules approve its outright use.  The design point is that all aspects of the ball will conform to USGA rules and we will diligently seek its placement on the approved USGA ball list. 
      
Q:  Can the SmartGolfBall be used in recreational play?
A:  Yes.  In general local golf club rules do not require a ball to be on the USGA approved ball list before it can be used for recreational play.  The SmartGolfBall is designed to adhere to all USGA standards for placement on the approved ball list.  GrowGolf will submit its ball to the USGA's testing procedures and diligently pursue its placement on the approved ball list. 
      
Q:  Will the SmartGolfBall be USGA approved?
A:  As with any newly announced ball, Initially it will not be on the USGA approved ball list [for professional tournaments] because the ball must pass a series of rigid USGA lab tests to be placed on the list; however the design point for the ball is that it will adhere to all aspects of the USGA ball standards and we will diligently seek its placement on the approved USGA ball list. 
      
Q:  How long will the SmartGolfBall last?
A:  It will last as long as any other ball in your bag of similar construction.
      
Q:  Are there batteries?
A:  Yes, there is a rechargeable battery in the ball. It is quickly/easily recharged similar to the way your electric toothbrush is charged when sitting in its holder.
      
Q:  How does the SmartGolfBall impact the way a golfer normally plays?
A:  we designed it so that there is no effect on how the ball plays.
       
Q:  Can I check the SmartGolfBall’s Battery to see if it is functional?
A:  Yes, using your smartphone.
 
Q:  What will happen when the SmartGolfBall’s battery power runs out?
A:  Your Smartphone will “beep” before you tee-off to warn you that you are at about 20% power, at which point the golfer should start to monitor the ball's charge to ensure that he/she has enough power left to finish any hole started!  If the ball loses power altogether and becomes inoperable then the golfer has the option of following USGA rule 5-3: unfit for play rule, which allows the golfer to substitute a new SmartGolfBall without penalty.
      
Q:  Can the SmartGolfBall’s battery be recharged?
A:  Yes.
      
Q:  what is the life span of a the SmartGolfBall's battery (meaning how long before the batter cannot retain charge)?
A:  
      
Q:  What certifications will the SmartGolfBall have?
A:  The design point for the SmartGolfBall is that it will be FCC, UL and CE certified.
      
Q:  Will the ISC continue to operate when the SmartGolfBall goes in the water?
A:   Yes; but the strength of the signal will depend on how deep the water is. 
      
Q:  Will the dynamics of the SmartGolfBall be affected by the new technology?
A:  No.
      
Q:  What are the SmartGolfBall specs?
A:  With regard to it's specs, the design point for the SmartGolfBall is that it will conform to all physical requirements for placement on the USGA's approved golf ball list for professional tournaments. Essentially those requirements are:


General: the material and construction of the ball must not be contrary to the purpose and intent of the Rules.
 Weight: the ball must not weigh more than 1.620 ounces (45.93 gm).

Size: the ball must have a diameter of not less than 1.680 inches (42.67 mm). 

Spherical Symmetry: the ball is designed and manufactured to behave symmetrically.

Initial Velocity: the speed of the ball off the clubface cannot be greater than 250 ft. per sec.  when struck under predefined lab conditions; i.e. ( fixed force at fixed launch angle, etc.).

Overall Distance Standard: the distance the ball travels under predefined lab conditions cannot be greater than 317 yards.

      
Q:  Which Smartphones will be supported?  Operating systems supported?
A:  Plans are to initially make it available on the two major types of Smartphones (Androids and iPhones with applicable operating systems).  We will have more detail when we get close to releasing the SmartGolfBall.
      
Q:  How long will it take to fully charge a SmartGolfBall
A:  As with any battery operated device, the time it takes to fully charge the device will depend on the state of its charge when placed in the charger.  The design point for the SmartGolfBall is that it will sit in the ball holder/charging tray when not in use.  The ball holder/charging tray will hold about a dozen balls and will trickle charge the SmartGolfBalls in the tray; so that whenever a ball is needed it will likely be fully charged.  
The design point for the SmartGolfBall is that it should be fully charged about 12 hours if it was completely discharged at the start; however that will have to be verified when the first prototypes are tested.  The ball holder/charging tray can also be plugged-in for charging the SmartGolfBalls overnight.
      
Q:  What is the Warranty on the SmartGolfBall?
A:  Future Perks #10 (Beta Test first SmartGolfBall), #11 (Lessons on DigitalCaddie) and #12 (SmartGolfBall Tournament for 4) use prototype SmartGolfBalls and by the very nature of being prototypes the balls may not be perfect so a standard warranty is not applicable.  Additionally the above referenced Future Perks are an important part of the process of testing the basic features of the SmartGolfBall and in the execution of the Perks, it is expected that some issues may be uncovered which will in turn lead to an improved product.  However it is our intent to provide prototype balls that will be adequate to perform meaningful tests of the basic features of the SmartGolfBall. 
Once production SmartGolfBalls are made available for purchase, a standard ball warranty will come with the product which essentially will be that GrowGolf will warranty the product to be free of defects in material and workmanship for one year from the date of original retail purchase, except the following:
 

Damage caused by accident, misuse, abuse, disassembly, unauthorized modification or neglect.
Damage resulting from the performance of repairs by someone not authorized by our company
Damage resulting from failure to follow instructions contained in your instruction manual. 
        Q:  If a SmartGolfBall loses its charge after the tee-off but before holing out on a given hole, what effect will such an “unfit for play” ball have on the golfer's score?
A:   No effect and no penalty to substitute a working SmartGolfBall!  USGA rule 5-3: unfit for play rule applies; which allows substitution of ""unfit for play"" balls for a working one.

Features and Benefits

Q:  What is one of the key problems facing golf today?
A:  Pace of play! And the SmartGolfBall will help improve the pace of play.
      
Q:  What is the major cause for the slow pace of play problem?
A:  Several studies have been done, and most experts agree that pace of play is mostly impacted by lost balls (i.e., time wasted looking for lost balls).     
      
Q:  How will the SmartGolfBall help to grow golf?A:   By improving pace of play, encouraging more people to play (faster rounds). Also with increased course throughput allowing course owners to book more tee times each day (more revenue). Once the architecture is fully implemented across all golf components (gisA), this system will help new golfers by being a “DigitalCaddie and DigitalTrainer”.
      
Q:  Why should I buy the SmartGolfBall rather than my usual brand name ball?
A:  We believe that the technology in the ball will not have a noticeable impact on the dynamics of brand name balls in which it is embedded; therefore our goal is to encourage its placement in all brand name balls. Thereby eliminating your dilemma.  However until the use of the embedded technology becomes widespread, if you purchase our balls which do have embedded technology you can improve your pace of play and gain other valuable information about your golf game.
      

Q:  Can the SmartGolfBall be used with existing golf equipment?
A:  Yes.
      
Q:  Does the SmartGolfBall make it easier to play golf at night courses?
A:  Yes because the DigitalCaddie will lead you to the ball, even in night golf course flood lighting.
      
Q:  Will the SmartGolfBall work with GPS based range finders?
A:  Our architecture (gisA) will allow for developers to create apps to interface GPS range finders with the SmartGolfBall.

</div></div>","Remove the controller from the equation and interact with technology and the digital space directly. Current technology is inflexible, forcing you to utilize archaic keyboards and controllers to fully realize their capabilities. Now, you can remove that degree of separation between you and your tech to experience your content without delays or barriers. Update: We have teamed up with heavy metal guitarist and composer, Jason Becker, who suffers from ALS for almost 30 years to develop technologies so that other people with physical limitations can live more meaningful, fulfilling lives and have more interaction with other people: The first FREE compatible app of FlexR: RehabFit with its embedded exercise programs is crafted by licensed health professions based upon current clinical evidence and experience. 
 The difference between FlexR and other movement sensing devices such as the Wii Fit or Xbox Kinect is that FlexR detects muscle contraction/relaxation and strength. 
 Play smartphone games via your muscle! The first FREE app, RehabFit makes exercising extremely easy and fun. RehabFit delivers workouts designed specifically towards your physique and your goals allowing you to achieve a more balanced physique.
 FlexR is able to detect even the slightest muscle activity. Enter a completely new dimension of tech and human interaction.  Unlike gesture control devices like Myo, FlexR is applicable to ALL surface muscles! Many muscle and joint pains such as neck pain, shoulder pain, low back pain, knee pain are induced by an imbalance or weakness of certain muscle groups. The best long term solution to address these issues is to strengthen weak muscles, relax tight muscles, and improve precise muscle control in day-to-day movement.
 You'll have fun exercising with RehabFit knowing that you're actually working out your key muscles.         FlexR's API is an open-source platform dedicated to one thing: the intersection of technology and the human body. It allows you to write and develop your own apps, giving you the tools to make an entirely new generation of programs. Port your favorite games, discover new ways to use the hardware, install your own home-brew software -- your ideas and creativity excite us and we want your help to develop the FlexR into a full-spectrum platform.The applications are endless the potential for new and innovating games and programs is virtually unlimited.         Bluetooth transmission: Low Energy Medical Grade Electromyographic Sensor iOS and Android device compatible Eco-friendly materialBattery life: 10 - 20 hrs.

<p>Snowfoot goes one step beyond all the other products on the market… and then another.</p><p>Alpine-touring skis, splitboards, crampons and snowshoes are not all-in-one mobility solutions.  They only work well within certain limits.  Snowfoot is the first mobility tool that does literally everything </p>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Step into Snow</b></h2><div><b><br/></b></div>

<h3><b>Flotation technology for powder snow</b></h3><p>Snowfoot revolutionizes snow flotation.  Our patented technology reduces snow displacement and maximizes the buoyant force. The deck's network of cells limits foot penetration by allowing snow to pass freely without focusing compression.</p><p>At the same time,  weight gets distributed across three dimensions in the snow, rather than two, because the coefficient of surface contact area to surface dimension is effectively doubled.</p><p>In other words: with half the size of a traditional snowshoe, Snowfoot has the same flotation in powder snow.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004035/files/20141111001858-powdertracks.jpg?1415693938"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3><b>Grip and traction for all conditions</b></h3><div>
<p>Snowfoot is a definitive '<i>snow crampon</i>.' Each individual cell of the deck is a three dimensional anchor in the snow.  The cells work collectively across the entirety of the deck's surface to create a platform that grips terrain and distributes weight . </p>
</div><p>With integrated steel crampons for grip on ice and reliable footholds on rock, Snowfoot is the first snowshoe to utilize every element of the structure for continuous, uniform, and total traction.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004501/files/20141111050540-underside.jpg?1415711140"" src="""" style=""""/><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Fit for every boot type and size</b></p>
<p>Snowfoot uses a universal binding that works with all types of boots. The heel piece slides to accommodate sizes 38-48 (US 6-14),  and aligns both front and rear crampons in the ideal underfoot position. A simple closure system allows for rapid entry, adjustment and release.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional snowshoes with large curved tips, Snowfoot does not slip away while traversing.</p><p>Snowfoot can traverse steep icy walls with its front crampon spikes.  In snowy traverses, the corners of the the deck are sufficient to maintain traction. <br/></p>

<h3><b>Descent</b></h3>
<p>With minimal decking material beyond the boot toe and heel, plus a fixed-heel binding,  Snowfoot descends exceptionally well. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996686/files/20141108095833-downhill.jpg?1415469513"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><br/></div><br/><h2> <br/> </h2>

<p>Snowfoot weighs little more than 1kg (2.2lbs) per pair, a 50% improvement on most  ""all-mountain"" snowshoes.  With dimensions of 37cm x 23cm x 2.5cm (14.5in x 9in x 0.7in), Snowfoot is by far the most compact snowshoe on the market.  </p>

<h4>1. SHIPPING &amp; PAYMENT</h4>
<p><b>When will I receive my Snowfoot?</b></p>

<p>The ‘experience perks’ can be redeemed at a mutually convenient date, starting late January 2015. </p>
<p><b>Where do you ship to?</b></p>
<p>We use major courier companies and we will ship to anywhere that they deliver.</p>
<p><b>What are the estimated shipping costs outside of Italy?</b></p>
<p>Estimated shipping costs: approximately 20€ for Schengen countries; 45€ for North America; 60€ Norway, Switzerland, Japan.</p>
<p><b>Should I make a larger donation to cover the shipping costs?</b></p>
<p>No.  We will confirm the final shipping cost with you before shipping.  You may pay for the shipping through our website’s secure online payment system. </p>
<p><b>Is there a warranty for Snowfoot? </b> </p>
<p>Yes. Snowfoot comes with a one-year limited replacement warranty for manufacturing defects.  Breakage under extreme use may not qualify for a replacement warranty. We are not liable for damages incurred through improper use or tampering.</p>
<p><b>Do you accept foreign (non-euro) currency?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Your credit card provider will automatically convert the € price into your native currency when you make a donation.</p>

<br/>
<h4>2. SIZING &amp; COLORS</h4>
<p>Snowfoot works with all boot types.  Since boots with the same size can have different lengths, it is best to measure the exact length of the boots you intend to use.  </p>
<p>As a general rule, Snowfoot will work with all ski and snowboard boots beyond size 35 european (5 US), and all lightweight winter boots and shoes beyond size 38 european (6 US men).  </p>
<p><b>How do I determine if my boot fits with Snowfoot?</b></p>
<p>Measure the overall distance from the tip of the boot to the back of the heel.  If the boot sole length (BSL) is anywhere between 245mm and 365mm (9.5in and 14.5in) your boot will fit.</p>
<p><b>My foot is smaller than size 38!?</b></p>
<p>A: We recommend you measure your boot sole length.  It is probable that your boot length is long enough, even if your foot size is less than 38.  </p>
<p><b>I have small feet.  How will this affect my Snowfoot experience?</b></p>
<p>A: Although there might seem like an excess of material behind your foot, the Snowfoot will have the exact same grip and traction for you as it would a larger person.  You will enjoy extra floatation in the deepest of snows.</p>
<p><b>My size 48 snowboard boot just barely fits on the deck.  How will this affect my Snowfoot experience</b>?</p>
<p>A. No worries. In the course of prototyping Snowfoot, we realized that excess decking behind the heel was unnecessary.  Not having the extra material behind your foot will give you even greater precision and maneuverability.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Will my Snowfoot look exactly like the pictures?</b></p>
<p>To a large extent, yes.  The images in this presentation are accurate representations of Snowfoot, but not definitive.  There could be some slight differences in color tones and minor modifications of components during the final stages of production. We will keep you updated as we get closer to the release date.  </p>

<p>Snowfoot è un passo oltre tutti gli altri prodotti sul mercato. E un altro ancora…</p><p>Sci d’alpinismo, splitboards, ramponi e ciaspole tradizionali non sono soluzioni di mobilità multifunzionali.  Possiedono buone prestazioni, ma entro certi limiti. </p><p>Snowfoot è il primo strumento di mobilità integrale che fa letteralmente tutto.</p>

Incorpora tutte le caratteristiche positive di mobilità di altre soluzioni, eliminandone tuttavia i loro limiti.  Di conseguenza, Snowfoot si presta ad ogni tipo di attività in inverno.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Una tecnologia innovativa per il galleggiamento in neve soffice</b></h3><p>Snowfoot ridimensiona il problema del galleggiamento in neve soffice.  Il nostro rivoluzionario design brevettato consente di aumentare del 50% la densità di aderenza sul manto nevoso a parità di superficie, minimizzando così il grado di sprofondamento verticale, pur mantenendo le dimensioni della racchetta al minimo.</p><p>L’innovativa struttura a celle tridimensionali è stata disegnata per soddisfare due funzionalità chiave: garantire una compressione controllata e al tempo stesso consentire il flusso delle neve soffice in eccesso, aumentando quindi al contempo galleggiabilità e aderenza in neve soffice.</p><p>In altre parole, Snowfoot offre prestazioni di galleggiabilità pari a quelle di racchette da neve moderne, ma con dimensioni (e peso) dimezzati.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004035/files/20141111001858-powdertracks.jpg?1415693938"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3><b>Presa e trazione in tutte le condizioni</b></h3><div>
<p>Snowfoot è in definitiva un '<i>rampone da neve</i>.' Ogni cella della piastra è un singolo ancoraggio tridimensionale che lavora sia in neve polverosa sia in neve compatta. L’insieme delle celle formano complessivamente una struttura che fornisce presa sul manto nevoso e distribuisce il peso.</p>
</div><p>Con il suo sistema di punte ramponate integrate si ottiene una presa sicura su ghiaccio ed un equilibrio affidabile su terreno roccioso.
Snowfoot è la prima racchetta da neve che utilizza tutti i componenti della struttura per garantire una trazione totale, continua e uniforme.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1004501/files/20141111050540-underside.jpg?1415711140"" src="""" style=""""/><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Per ogni calzatura, per tutte le misure</b></p>
<p>Snowfoot offre un sistema d’allacciamento universale per l’utilizzo con qualsiasi tipo di scarpone invernale. La posizione della talloniera è regolabile per accomodare le misure da 38 al 48. Snowfoot è stato progettato per consentire un’ottimale posizionamento sottopiede delle punte ramponate. Il pratico e funzionale sistema di fissaggio consente un semplice e rapido modo di aggancio, regolazione e sgancio.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Ogni passo in ambiente alpino è in salita, in discesa o in traverso: Snowfoot ti accompagna in ogni direzione.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b> Verticale </b></h3>
<p>Essendo nato per la salita, Snowfoot spinge per portarti in vetta. Ad ogni passo, lascia un’impronta piatta e ben definita creando così una sorta di scalinata verso l’obiettivo - che può essere utilizzata nelle ripetizioni durante tutta la stagione invernale.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/995104/files/20141107144442-vertical.jpg?1415400282"" src="""" style=""""/> <br/>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Traverso</b></h3>
<p>Contrariamente alle racchette tradizionali le punte rialzate, la particolare forma di Snowfoot annulla il rischio di scivolamento durante i traversi.</p><p>Grazie alle punte ramponate frontali, Snowfoot consente una progressione sicura nei traversi su terreno ghiacciato o di neve compatta. Il bordo frontale della piastra è stato specificatamente progettato per offrire adeguata trazione anche in neve soffice.<br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<h3><b> Discesa </b></h3>
<p>In discesa Snowfoot ha prestazioni eccezionali. Con una superficie perimetrica minima attorno allo scarpone e la talloniera fissa,  Snowfoot consente una progressione in discesa rapida e sicura e una totale libertà di movimento. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996686/files/20141108095833-downhill.jpg?1415469513"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div><br/></div><br/><h2> <br/> </h2>

<p>Una coppia di Snowfoot pesa poco più di 1kg: una drastica riduzione di quasi il 50% rispetto a racchette tradizionali “all-mountain”. Con le sue incredibilmente minime dimensioni  (37cm x 23cm x 2.5cm), Snowfoot è in assoluto la più compatta racchetta da neve sul mercato. </p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b> Portabilità </b></h3>
<p>Le dimensioni compatte di Snowfoot rendono possibile e pratica la trasportabilità di Snowfoot durante l’inutilizzo. Il volume complessivo di una coppia a pacchetto è di 8,5L: ciò significa che Snowfoot - assieme al kit antivalanga da freerider - si ripone comodamente anche in uno zainetto da 18L.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1001894/files/20141110095536-storage.jpg?1415642136"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h3><b>Gamma totale di movimento</b></h3>
<p>Con un’agilità e precisione sulla neve senza precedenti, Snowfoot garantisce la massima mobilità in ambiente alpino.  </p><p>Contrariamente alle racchette tradizionali, concepite per una progressione monodirezionale su terreno uniforme a moderate pendenze, Snowfoot consente un movimento preciso ed accurato in ogni direzione.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/995156/files/20141107151344-mvmtrange.jpg?1415402024"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b> Ergonomia </b></h3>
<p>Grazie alla flessibilità controllata della piastra, Snowfoot accompagna il movimento naturale del piede. In aggiunta, il minimo ingombro longitudinale e laterale consente una camminata rilassata e libera: quella che noi chiamiamo “un’esperienza a piedi nudi”.  Snowfoot si adatta a te e non viceversa; non richiede quindi nessuna particolare tecnica o modifica al tuo naturale  passo.</p>

<h2><br/></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Responsività ed affidabilità in casi di emergenza</b></h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>La possibilità di muoversi rapidamente e in sicurezza in condizioni di terreno instabile è una caratteristica distintiva di Snowfoot.  Sia che tu abbia semplicemente la necessità di tornare sui tuoi passi, oppure uscire rapidamente da una situazione critica dove ogni secondo è vitale, Snowfoot ti aiuta a mantenere il controllo.</p><p><br/></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/995259/files/20141107155217-helisoccorso.jpg?1415404337"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Le squadre di soccorso alpino sono consapevoli che Snowfoot può fare la differenza in situazioni critiche. Pisteurs, paramedici e addetti operativi del comprensorio di Alagna Freerideparadise avranno Snowfoot nel loro equipaggiamento per la prossima stagione sciistica.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Mai più tracce a zig-zag in terreni esposti</b></h3>
<p>Con Snowfoot, la traccia di salita non deve seguire necessariamente la classica linea a zig-zag. La progressione a massima pendenza può essere, e spesso è, un’alternativa migliore e più sicura per limitare il tempo di esposizione su terreni a rischio valanghe.</p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Vie di fuga</b></h3>
<p>La strategia di uscita può essere la migliore decisione che tu abbia mai presa. Snowfoot migliora l’abilità a svincolarsi da situazioni di pericolo, come nel caso di errore di valutazione della discesa, disorientamento o altri  imprevisti.</p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Muoversi su terreni in valanga</b></h3>
<p>Il terreno da valanga è notoriamente complesso da percorrere. Sia in caso di team di soccorso organizzato, sia per situazioni di auto-soccorso, Snowfoot aumenta la rapidità e la tempestività negli spostamenti durante la fase di ricerca ARVA e fornisce maggiore agilità e stabilità nel disseppellimento su terreni disagevoli.</p>

What they say about Snowfoot

Silvio Mondinelli, Professional Alpinist, 13th person to climb the fourteen 8000m peaks without oxygen: 
“For work and play, Snowfoot is an incredible way to approach the mountain.”


Andrea Enzio, Director & lead guide of Alagna Mountain Guide Corps, snowboard instructor:  “I am glad to be an early adopter from the snowboard community. For us, Snowfoot is a revolutionary step forward.”Michele Cucchi, Mountain guide, rescue professional, lead climber: 2014 Italian K2 expedition: 
“With Snowfoot, I see the opportunity for alpine search and rescue team to work safely and improve their response time.” 



Snowfoot in the press


""A new hybrid snowshoe that reduces volume and at the same time performs better on ice.”  La Stampa


""A company disrupting the industry with a snow mobility tool that's one part versatile and two parts radical."" snowshoemag.com
The whole mountain with one little tool



Snowfoot goes one step beyond all the other products on the market… and then another.Alpine-touring skis, splitboards, crampons and snowshoes are not all-in-one mobility solutions.  They only work well within certain limits.  Snowfoot is the first mobility tool that does literally everything 

Step into Snow
Snowfoot has all the mobility characteristics of other equipment and none of their critical limitations.  As a result, Snowfoot is useful for every type of winter activity.
Flotation technology for powder snowSnowfoot revolutionizes snow flotation.  Our patented technology reduces snow displacement and maximizes the buoyant force. The deck's network of cells limits foot penetration by allowing snow to pass freely without focusing compression.At the same time,  weight gets distributed across three dimensions in the snow, rather than two, because the coefficient of surface contact area to surface dimension is effectively doubled.In other words: with half the size of a traditional snowshoe, Snowfoot has the same flotation in powder snow.


Grip and traction for all conditions
Snowfoot is a definitive 'snow crampon.' Each individual cell of the deck is a three dimensional anchor in the snow.  The cells work collectively across the entirety of the deck's surface to create a platform that grips terrain and distributes weight . 
With integrated steel crampons for grip on ice and reliable footholds on rock, Snowfoot is the first snowshoe to utilize every element of the structure for continuous, uniform, and total traction.
Fit for every boot type and size
Snowfoot uses a universal binding that works with all types of boots. The heel piece slides to accommodate sizes 38-48 (US 6-14),  and aligns both front and rear crampons in the ideal underfoot position. A simple closure system allows for rapid entry, adjustment and release.

Limitless climbing potential



Each step in an alpine environment is either up, down, or traversal, Snowfoot takes you in every direction. 

Vertical
Born for the climb, Snowfoot wants to go straight up the mountain.  Each step leaves a flat imprint  which can be easily followed and reused throughout the season.
 

Traverse
Unlike traditional snowshoes with large curved tips, Snowfoot does not slip away while traversing.Snowfoot can traverse steep icy walls with its front crampon spikes.  In snowy traverses, the corners of the the deck are sufficient to maintain traction. 


Descent
With minimal decking material beyond the boot toe and heel, plus a fixed-heel binding,  Snowfoot descends exceptionally well.   
Minimal dimensions for maximum movement - on and off the snow


Snowfoot weighs little more than 1kg (2.2lbs) per pair, a 50% improvement on most  ""all-mountain"" snowshoes.  With dimensions of 37cm x 23cm x 2.5cm (14.5in x 9in x 0.7in), Snowfoot is by far the most compact snowshoe on the market.  
Clean and practical storage
Snowfoot’s low-profile and compact dimensions make it easy to store in a small rucksack.  Packaged volume is about 8.5L.

Full range of movement 
Snowfoot permits an unprecedented precision and agility in snow.Unlike traditional snowshoes designed for continuous forward movement on constant terrain, Snowfoot steps in every direction with equal ease and accuracy.  Up step, down step, side step, ‘dubstep’: Snowfoot is for dancers!


Ergonomic walking
Controlled flexibility in the deck allows Snowfoot to follow your boot’s natural movement.  With minimum bulk around your your feet, every step is free and relaxed for a true barefoot snow-walking experience.  Snowfoot does not require any special technique or modification to your natural stride.


Responsive and dependable in emergency situations 

Snowfoot helps you move quickly and safely across unstable terrain and take control of every situation. 


Helicopter search and rescue operators, ski patrollers and first responders from Alagna Freeride Paradise ski resort will be using Snowfoot on Monte Rosa this winter. 

Avoid zig-zag cuts in exposed terrain
Vertical progression can reduce avalanche exposure in high-risk terrain. With Snowfoot, you do not need to make zig-zag  cuts across the snow face.



Empower an exit strategy
Snowfoot facilitates your ability to climb out of or away from danger when you realize that you’ve misjudged your descent.

 

Negotiate avalanche debris
Snowfoot is a better way to move quickly and decisively across avalanche debris. Organizations and individual groups can manage critical sites with surefooted responsiveness.  



For every passion and every job


Snowfoot fuels your passion by boosting performance and amplifying access potential. No matter what you do or how big your goals are, Snowfoot is equal to the task.


Freeriders, from beginners to experts


Snowboarders and skiers go further in the mountains without the need for specialized and expensive touring equipment. 



Splitboarders and alpine-touring skiers
Add stability and safety in exposed danger zones and keep your grip while anchoring a belay.  Snowfoot is complementary to touring gear and split-boards, taking off where the skin track ends.


Ice climbers and high-mountain specialists


For specialized climbing objectives requiring technical equipment and/or heavy base camp supplies, Snowfoot is the perfect lightweight, low-bulk approach tool.  



Mountain Professionals


With Snowfoot, you can be ready, steady, and reactive in every situation: perfect for professionals in snowy or technical environments.


Walkers and excursionists


Even in the heart of winter, trails are rarely covered with uniform or consistent snow.  Snowfoot is the easy and lightweight way to ensure non-slip travel.


Lumberjacks, farmers, ranchers and hunters
Snowfoot gives you the possibility to work efficiently through even the most severe snowstorms.

2. SIZING & COLORS
Snowfoot works with all boot types.  Since boots with the same size can have different lengths, it is best to measure the exact length of the boots you intend to use.  
As a general rule, Snowfoot will work with all ski and snowboard boots beyond size 35 european (5 US), and all lightweight winter boots and shoes beyond size 38 european (6 US men).  
How do I determine if my boot fits with Snowfoot?
Measure the overall distance from the tip of the boot to the back of the heel.  If the boot sole length (BSL) is anywhere between 245mm and 365mm (9.5in and 14.5in) your boot will fit.
My foot is smaller than size 38!?
A: We recommend you measure your boot sole length.  It is probable that your boot length is long enough, even if your foot size is less than 38.  
I have small feet.  How will this affect my Snowfoot experience?
A: Although there might seem like an excess of material behind your foot, the Snowfoot will have the exact same grip and traction for you as it would a larger person.  You will enjoy extra floatation in the deepest of snows.
My size 48 snowboard boot just barely fits on the deck.  How will this affect my Snowfoot experience?
A. No worries. In the course of prototyping Snowfoot, we realized that excess decking behind the heel was unnecessary.  Not having the extra material behind your foot will give you even greater precision and maneuverability.

Will my Snowfoot look exactly like the pictures?
To a large extent, yes.  The images in this presentation are accurate representations of Snowfoot, but not definitive.  There could be some slight differences in color tones and minor modifications of components during the final stages of production. We will keep you updated as we get closer to the release date.

Cosa dicono di Snowfoot

Silvio Mondinelli, hymalaista professionista, 13° alpinista a conquistare tutti i 14 ottomila senza l’utilizzo di ossigeno: 
“Per gioco o per lavoro, Snowfoot è un mezzo incredibile per approciare la montagna.”


Andrea Enzio, capo guide alpine Alagna Valsesia, istruttore di snowboard:  “Sono felice di essere tra i primi utilizzatori nella comunità degli snowboarder. Per noi, Snowfoot è un rivoluzionario passo avanti.” Michele Cucchi, guida alpina e soccorritore professionista, capo spedizione e unico italiano in vetta al “K2 60 years later”: 
“Snowfoot offre l’opportunità alle squadre di soccorso alpino di intervenire in sicurezza e migliorare i tempi di reazione.” 



Snowfoot sulla stampa





""Una nuova ciaspola ibrida che riduce l'ingombro e che al contempo risulta più performante sui ghiaccio.”  La Stampa


“Una startup che rivoluzionerà il settore con un’attrezzatura versatile e radicalmente innovativa per una nuova mobilità sulla neve."" snowshoemag.com
Tutta la montagna in un piccolo attrezzo



Snowfoot è un passo oltre tutti gli altri prodotti sul mercato. E un altro ancora…Sci d’alpinismo, splitboards, ramponi e ciaspole tradizionali non sono soluzioni di mobilità multifunzionali.  Possiedono buone prestazioni, ma entro certi limiti. Snowfoot è il primo strumento di mobilità integrale che fa letteralmente tutto.

Affronta la neve passo dopo passo
Snowfoot offre sicurezza e accesso a tutti i terreni invernali in ogni condizione. Incorpora tutte le caratteristiche positive di mobilità di altre soluzioni, eliminandone tuttavia i loro limiti.  Di conseguenza, Snowfoot si presta ad ogni tipo di attività in inverno.
Una tecnologia innovativa per il galleggiamento in neve sofficeSnowfoot ridimensiona il problema del galleggiamento in neve soffice.  Il nostro rivoluzionario design brevettato consente di aumentare del 50% la densità di aderenza sul manto nevoso a parità di superficie, minimizzando così il grado di sprofondamento verticale, pur mantenendo le dimensioni della racchetta al minimo.L’innovativa struttura a celle tridimensionali è stata disegnata per soddisfare due funzionalità chiave: garantire una compressione controllata e al tempo stesso consentire il flusso delle neve soffice in eccesso, aumentando quindi al contempo galleggiabilità e aderenza in neve soffice.In altre parole, Snowfoot offre prestazioni di galleggiabilità pari a quelle di racchette da neve moderne, ma con dimensioni (e peso) dimezzati.


Presa e trazione in tutte le condizioni
Snowfoot è in definitiva un 'rampone da neve.' Ogni cella della piastra è un singolo ancoraggio tridimensionale che lavora sia in neve polverosa sia in neve compatta. L’insieme delle celle formano complessivamente una struttura che fornisce presa sul manto nevoso e distribuisce il peso.
Con il suo sistema di punte ramponate integrate si ottiene una presa sicura su ghiaccio ed un equilibrio affidabile su terreno roccioso.
Snowfoot è la prima racchetta da neve che utilizza tutti i componenti della struttura per garantire una trazione totale, continua e uniforme.
Per ogni calzatura, per tutte le misure
Snowfoot offre un sistema d’allacciamento universale per l’utilizzo con qualsiasi tipo di scarpone invernale. La posizione della talloniera è regolabile per accomodare le misure da 38 al 48. Snowfoot è stato progettato per consentire un’ottimale posizionamento sottopiede delle punte ramponate. Il pratico e funzionale sistema di fissaggio consente un semplice e rapido modo di aggancio, regolazione e sgancio.

Capacità di arrampicata senza limiti



Ogni passo in ambiente alpino è in salita, in discesa o in traverso: Snowfoot ti accompagna in ogni direzione.

 Verticale 
Essendo nato per la salita, Snowfoot spinge per portarti in vetta. Ad ogni passo, lascia un’impronta piatta e ben definita creando così una sorta di scalinata verso l’obiettivo - che può essere utilizzata nelle ripetizioni durante tutta la stagione invernale.
 

Traverso
Contrariamente alle racchette tradizionali le punte rialzate, la particolare forma di Snowfoot annulla il rischio di scivolamento durante i traversi.Grazie alle punte ramponate frontali, Snowfoot consente una progressione sicura nei traversi su terreno ghiacciato o di neve compatta. Il bordo frontale della piastra è stato specificatamente progettato per offrire adeguata trazione anche in neve soffice.


 Discesa 
In discesa Snowfoot ha prestazioni eccezionali. Con una superficie perimetrica minima attorno allo scarpone e la talloniera fissa,  Snowfoot consente una progressione in discesa rapida e sicura e una totale libertà di movimento.   
Minime dimensioni per una massima mobilità. Con o senza neve


Una coppia di Snowfoot pesa poco più di 1kg: una drastica riduzione di quasi il 50% rispetto a racchette tradizionali “all-mountain”. Con le sue incredibilmente minime dimensioni  (37cm x 23cm x 2.5cm), Snowfoot è in assoluto la più compatta racchetta da neve sul mercato. 
 Portabilità 
Le dimensioni compatte di Snowfoot rendono possibile e pratica la trasportabilità di Snowfoot durante l’inutilizzo. Il volume complessivo di una coppia a pacchetto è di 8,5L: ciò significa che Snowfoot - assieme al kit antivalanga da freerider - si ripone comodamente anche in uno zainetto da 18L.

Gamma totale di movimento
Con un’agilità e precisione sulla neve senza precedenti, Snowfoot garantisce la massima mobilità in ambiente alpino.  Contrariamente alle racchette tradizionali, concepite per una progressione monodirezionale su terreno uniforme a moderate pendenze, Snowfoot consente un movimento preciso ed accurato in ogni direzione.


 Ergonomia 
Grazie alla flessibilità controllata della piastra, Snowfoot accompagna il movimento naturale del piede. In aggiunta, il minimo ingombro longitudinale e laterale consente una camminata rilassata e libera: quella che noi chiamiamo “un’esperienza a piedi nudi”.  Snowfoot si adatta a te e non viceversa; non richiede quindi nessuna particolare tecnica o modifica al tuo naturale  passo.


Responsività ed affidabilità in casi di emergenza

La possibilità di muoversi rapidamente e in sicurezza in condizioni di terreno instabile è una caratteristica distintiva di Snowfoot.  Sia che tu abbia semplicemente la necessità di tornare sui tuoi passi, oppure uscire rapidamente da una situazione critica dove ogni secondo è vitale, Snowfoot ti aiuta a mantenere il controllo.


Le squadre di soccorso alpino sono consapevoli che Snowfoot può fare la differenza in situazioni critiche. Pisteurs, paramedici e addetti operativi del comprensorio di Alagna Freerideparadise avranno Snowfoot nel loro equipaggiamento per la prossima stagione sciistica.

Mai più tracce a zig-zag in terreni esposti
Con Snowfoot, la traccia di salita non deve seguire necessariamente la classica linea a zig-zag. La progressione a massima pendenza può essere, e spesso è, un’alternativa migliore e più sicura per limitare il tempo di esposizione su terreni a rischio valanghe.



Vie di fuga
La strategia di uscita può essere la migliore decisione che tu abbia mai presa. Snowfoot migliora l’abilità a svincolarsi da situazioni di pericolo, come nel caso di errore di valutazione della discesa, disorientamento o altri  imprevisti.

 

Muoversi su terreni in valanga
Il terreno da valanga è notoriamente complesso da percorrere. Sia in caso di team di soccorso organizzato, sia per situazioni di auto-soccorso, Snowfoot aumenta la rapidità e la tempestività negli spostamenti durante la fase di ricerca ARVA e fornisce maggiore agilità e stabilità nel disseppellimento su terreni disagevoli.



Per ogni passione, per ogni attività


Snowfoot soffia sul fuoco delle tue passioni, amplifica le prestazioni e aumenta le possibilità di accesso. Qualsiasi il tuo obiettivo e le tue necessità, Snowfoot è il tuo compagno fedele in tutte le occasioni.


Freerider, dal principiante all’esperto


Snowboarder e sciatori freeride possono realizzare i propri sogni ed avventurarsi oltre senza dover ricorrere ad una costosa attrezzatura da sci/snow alpinismo. Freerider veterani con sci, tavole e attacchi specifici possono tirare fuori il massimo dalla loro meritata discesa usando Snowfoot per la salita senza dover scendere a compromessi con l’attrezzatura preferita.



Scialpinisti e Snowboarder alpinisti
Grazie alla potenzialità di arrampicata di Snowfoot, potrai andare più in là, più in alto e più ripido come non mai. Aggiungi stabilità e sicurezza in zone esposte, mantieni la presa nelle manovre di corda. Snowfoot è un efficace complemento all’attrezzatura di scialpinismo, snow-alpinismo, splitboard, e si ingaggia quando la traccia delle tue pelli arriva al capolinea.


Alpinisti invernali


Per i tuoi obiettivi alpinistici invernali che richiedono equipaggiamento specifico e/o attrezzatura da campo, Snowfoot è la soluzione ultraleggera, a minimo ingombro per consentirti di accedere comodamente alla base della tua parete.



Professionisti della montagna


Rifugisti, personale degli impianti sciistici, lavoratori in ambiente innevato, possono concentrarsi sulle loro mansioni come mai in passato. Con Snowfoot sei pronto, stabile e reattivo in ogni situazione.


Escursionisti invernali


Anche se nel pieno della stagione invernale, i sentieri nelle Alpi sono raramente coperti da un manto nevoso uniforme. Dalla semplice passeggiata con il tuo cane ad escursioni più impegnative del weekend, Snowfoot è un modo semplice e sicuro per camminare su neve, ghiaccio, roccia, erba e radici.


Cacciatori, rifugisti, contadini, agricoltori
Se la tua vita è in mezzo alla natura, l’inverno non è una vacanza.  Snowfoot ti dà la possibilità di lavorare anche in condizioni climatiche avverse.

Lista completa dei premi a disposizione:Perchè abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiutoPur essendo la nostra ambizione grande come le montagne attorno a noi, grandi non sono le nostre risorse economiche. Fino ad oggi siamo stati in grado autofinanziare ogni fase dello sviluppo di Snowfoot. Di recente ci siamo impegnati con il rilevante investimento richiesto per la produzione degli stampi, l’attrezzaggio delle macchine, l’approvvigionamento dei materiali critici in modo da garantire la disponibilità del prodotto finito per il prossimo mese di Gennaio 2015. Ma ora abbiamo proprio bisogno del tuo supporto. Con la tua donazione su Indiegogo, la produzione della prima serie di Snowfoot può diventare realtà.  La tua partecipazione a questo progetto servirà anche a dare uno slancio all’innovazione e alla creatività della più ampia comunità di sciatori, scalatori, alpinisti ed escursionisti sulle Alpi. La storia di SnowfootQuattro anni fa, i primi prototipi di Snowfoot costruiti nel sottoscala erano realizzati con l’unico scopo di aiutare gli sciatori freerider nelle loro a scalate su ripidi pendii in neve fresca. Prendendo spunto da questa necessità, Snowfoot ha allargato la prospettiva per rispondere ad una domanda più ambiziosa: è possibile realizzare un attrezzo che consente di soddisfare le esigenze di progressione su ogni tipologia di terreno e in ogni condizione di manto nevoso? Ad oggi, Snowfoot si è evoluto in uno strumento multifunzionale che soddisfa un bisogno umano basilare: la mobilità. SviluppoNel corso degli ultimi nove mesi, Snowfoot si è trasformato da quello che era solo una meraviglia fatta a mano in un prodotto di design industriale che può prendere con onore posto nel panorama tecnologico sportivo allo stato dell’arte. La nostra squadra ha lavorato senza sosta a fianco di progettisti e ingegneri italiani di elevato calibro ed esperienza per guidarci nel design, nell’industrializzazione del prodotto, nella scelta di materiali d’avanguardia adatti a sopportare condizioni climatiche sfidanti. A metà Agosto di quest’anno - sui ghiacciai del Monte Rosa - abbiamo testato con successo e validato il nostro prototipo industriale definitivo.In Ottobre abbiamo depositato la domanda di brevetto per la nostra tecnologia proprietaria di galleggiamento/grip.Nelle ultime settimane abbiamo siglato accordi strategici con i nostri partner per la produzione e configurato la supply chain. Snowfoot sarà prodotto interamente in Italia.Nel frattempo, nel giro di pochissimo tempo, Snowfoot ha iniziato a raccogliere enorme interesse: siamo stati invitati a fiere di settore, mostre di tecnologia sportiva, gare ed eventi di freeride.  Abbiamo ricevuto validazione e conforto da esperti di settore e leader di opinione, contatti da distributori e marchi consolidati, giornalisti a livello internazionale, e l’invito a partecipare al prossimo ISPO Awards. Non da ultimo sono venuti a bussarci alla porta guide alpine, professionisti del soccorso e atleti alpinisti.
Poche settimane fa ci siamo impegnati con investimenti rilevanti per avviare l’attrezzaggio delle linee e l’approvvigionamento dei materiali critici della prima serie di prodotto.  In questa campagna promozionale su Indiegogo, Snowfoot è offerto ad un prezzo fortemente scontato come segno della nostra gratitudine per l’aiuto che vorrete darci a finanziare questa ultima ed avvincente fase del progetto.

FAQ 



1. PAGAMENTO & SPEDIZIONE
Quando potrò ricevere il mio Snowfoot?
Stiamo facendo il possibile per spedire le prime unità all’inizio di gennaio 2015. Questi tempi sono legati al nostro piano di produzione attuale. Sarai tempestivamente informato in caso di eventuali variazioni nei tempi di consegna. 
I premi “Esperienze” saranno erogati in base alla tua disponibilità, a partire da fine gennaio 2015.
La spedizione è compresa nel prezzo? 
La spedizione in Italia è gratuita.
Devo effettuare una donazione maggiore per coprire i costi di spedizione al di fuori dell’Italia?
No. Sarà possibile scegliere il metodo di spedizione sul nostro sito web ed effettuare direttamente il pagamento.
C’è una garanzia?  
Si. Snowfoot è coperto da garanzia per difetti di fabbrica, secondo la legislazione EU. Rotture in caso di utilizzo improprio o manomissione non rientrano in garanzia.



2. COLORI & MISURE
Snowfoot funziona con qualsiasi tipo di calzatura invernale: scarponi da snowboard, da sci, scialpinismo, trekking, scarpe da corsa. 
Come regola generale Snowfoot si adatta a tutti gli scarponi da sci e snowboard con misura dal 35 in su. Per quanto riguarda invece calzature non da sci, la misura minima è il 38.  
Il numero del mio piede è meno di 38!
Misura la distanza totale tra la punta e il tallone della calzatura (Boot Sole Length - BSL): se questa rientra nell’intervallo 245-365mm allora la calzatura va bene.

Come posso essere sicuro che la mia calzatura vada bene su Snowfoot?
Consigliamo in ogni caso di misurare la suddetta BSL. E’ molto probabile che la calzatura sia comunque di dimensioni sufficienti, anche se la misura del tuo piede è minore del 38.


Lo Snowfoot che ordinerò sarà esattamente come illustrato?
Le illustrazioni in questa presentazione sono rappresentazioni accurate del prodotto finito, ma non definitive. Potranno esserci lievi modifiche alle tonalità di colore o alla componentistica minore. Sarà nostra cura tenervi informati in caso di variazioni sensibili.

He was struck by a vehicle in front of his house on the morning of 6/30/12 and dragged approximately 50 feet. The driver fled the scene. Despite his injuries he was able to get inside his house and call for help. Kyle was in surgery for several hours and doctors were able to piece together his left arm socket with a metal plate and ten screws. He is in stable condition but will endure a long road to recovery. The vehicle in the news story that was impounded was actually his vehicle, which was parked at his house, and was not involved in the incident. He actually has to pay to get his vehicle out of the impound lot.Kyle is currently being cared for in the Burn Unit of Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) in Minneapolis, MN.His injuries include:

Two broken ribs
Broken right clavicle
Broken left upper arm
Broken pelvis
Skinned to the bone on elbow and wrist
Skinned head with exposed skull
What am I doing about it?Kyle is going to be facing some extra expenditures; works for a plastic manufacturing company and will likely not be able to return to work for some time. As a good friend I am starting this campaign to help him out during his recovery.The goal is set at $5000. I don't think this will cover all medical expenses. But I do think this will help him out, and at least alleviate some of the concern associated with a recovery of this type. Had this not been a hit and run, he would likely be in a better situation. My hope isn't to make him rich, just to help a friend who is down and needs a helping hand. I know I would appreciate it had I been in this situation.Even if the goal is not met, I want him to be able to pay his bills, rent, take care of his dog, etc...Kyle is a cool and unique individual. Even though he is severly injured, he is still in good spirits and altough his path to recovery will be tedious, I suspect he will recover with a good attitude. If anyone was deserving of a contribution, it would be him. I can surely attest that anyone's help will surely not go unnoticed.Why help?Because we are all human. And being human is what we are good at. Helping Kyle would be a selfless act and truly a notable deed. We all have had our moments when we were down and needed a little help, well Kyle is having one of those times. Some people may choose to pray, or some may choose to do something that will really help him. I want to show him that the combined forces of people helping will actually make a difference. So let's help him out!Here's a few reasons I think you should help:

Even something small will help.
Modern medicine can only fix his wounds.
Dude, his head was skinned to his skull!
It feels good to help a friend in need.
Empathize, it would suck to be in this shape right now.
How else can I help?If you can't contribute, that's ok. But here are some things you can do:

Spread the word! Tell others about this!
Send him a card!
Give him some kind or encouraging words!

<h3>Why SHAPED?</h3>
<p>Women and men have been plagued with numbers measuring their attractiveness as long as numbers have existed. The size of clothing, the weight of the body, height, bust, waist, thigh gap, ect. The truth is these numbers are generalities that work for some and make the rest of us feel unattractive. The SHAPED app will analyze the one true measure of physical beauty, the body's shape. 100 lbs or 300 lbs, there is an attractive shape. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/686/691/f8ed62e0faa57d12081fbd68c698cce7_large.png?1371668576"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>How it Works</h1>
<p>SHAPED uses patent pending technology to scan the body. First the user enters some general data to fine tune the scanning process; a height, sex,and body type is all that's needed. Then the app gets right down to business, just take a picture through the app and let it analyze the shape of your body. Wearing as little clothing as is comfortable and tight fitting clothes improves the accuracy of the scan. Once the app has analyzed the user's shape it will report back by highlighting areas of the picture that fall outside the desired body shape. By using targeted exercises and nutrition the user can shape their body to its full potential!</p>
<h1>Where are we now?</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/687/756/4d935ead180fcf1ee95a40e4dcc9a4d7_large.jpg?1371692376"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can see above that we have a working prototype that we now use in conjunction with a laptop and a basic digital camera or webcam. It can capture an image, it detects the outline of a body, and it does a lot of math attempting to analyze the body shape. Sometimes this prototype gets it right and sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/687/188/265dfe1c7ea8b6fde4f796d7f860fd4b_large.jpg?1371678896"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>We have spent a lot of time discussing the challenges of capturing a user's body and analyzing it. What happens if the user's arm covers one side of their body? What's the best mathematical model for each body type? The conclusion is that our prototype needs an image processing expert and a smartphone developer to be successful.</p>
<h1><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></h1>
<p>Developing apps is getting easier every day. There are a lot of people developing Tetris clones and fun games of the sort. SHAPED is not your ordinary software, it’s a complex tool. The analysis of the user’s body is very mathematically intensive. Capturing a picture of the user, normalizing it for orientation and size, and presenting the results to the user will require some strong image analysis and manipulation skills. With your support we will hire a specialized app developer and image processing guru.</p>
<h1><strong>Our Vision!</strong></h1>
<p>SHAPED will be a fantastic app with just its base scanning function. We are hoping the world sees the potential and helps us shape this app to its fullest. With enough money we can bring the SHAPED app to <strong>Android </strong>as well. Below are some future goals we can achieve when we pass the funding levels required.</p>
<p><strong>GOAL 1 - $30,000</strong></p>

<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h3>
<p>Software development isn't an easy process to manage. Many developers have strong egos, and the rate of work is very unpredictable. Fortunately for SHAPED, one of our founders has many years experience developing hardware and software for companies like Hewlett-Packard. We understand the challenges and here's our plan to keep them in check:</p>
<p>What if the developer we select doesn't meet our needs?     It's hard to know if a developer really has the skills they claim until they start working. We will do an extensive interview with candidates asking them for lots of sample work and explanations of that work until we are satisfied that they meet our needs. If the person we choose doesn't meet our expectations, then we will restart the interviews all over again. We are committed to SHAPED and will invest as much time and money as it takes to deliver.</p>
<p>What if we can't get the app into the AppStore?      There are lots of stories out there about apps being censored for silly reasons, but the truth is that Apple has clear rules for what you can and can't do. Part of our developer selection will be compliance with those rules and demonstration of apps that have made it into the app store. If the worst happens and we get thrown out, we will adjust our app to get it back in the store.</p>
<p>We want to hear what's on your mind and how you think SHAPED could be better. Please feel free to contact us with any suggestions or comments.                               </p>
<p>                            ""<strong>Beauty is the Shape, not the weight.""</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
</div></div>","Why SHAPED?
Women and men have been plagued with numbers measuring their attractiveness as long as numbers have existed. The size of clothing, the weight of the body, height, bust, waist, thigh gap, ect. The truth is these numbers are generalities that work for some and make the rest of us feel unattractive. The SHAPED app will analyze the one true measure of physical beauty, the body's shape. 100 lbs or 300 lbs, there is an attractive shape. 



How it Works
SHAPED uses patent pending technology to scan the body. First the user enters some general data to fine tune the scanning process; a height, sex,and body type is all that's needed. Then the app gets right down to business, just take a picture through the app and let it analyze the shape of your body. Wearing as little clothing as is comfortable and tight fitting clothes improves the accuracy of the scan. Once the app has analyzed the user's shape it will report back by highlighting areas of the picture that fall outside the desired body shape. By using targeted exercises and nutrition the user can shape their body to its full potential!
Where are we now?

 
You can see above that we have a working prototype that we now use in conjunction with a laptop and a basic digital camera or webcam. It can capture an image, it detects the outline of a body, and it does a lot of math attempting to analyze the body shape. Sometimes this prototype gets it right and sometimes it doesn't.

We have spent a lot of time discussing the challenges of capturing a user's body and analyzing it. What happens if the user's arm covers one side of their body? What's the best mathematical model for each body type? The conclusion is that our prototype needs an image processing expert and a smartphone developer to be successful.
Why Indiegogo?
Developing apps is getting easier every day. There are a lot of people developing Tetris clones and fun games of the sort. SHAPED is not your ordinary software, it’s a complex tool. The analysis of the user’s body is very mathematically intensive. Capturing a picture of the user, normalizing it for orientation and size, and presenting the results to the user will require some strong image analysis and manipulation skills. With your support we will hire a specialized app developer and image processing guru.
Our Vision!
SHAPED will be a fantastic app with just its base scanning function. We are hoping the world sees the potential and helps us shape this app to its fullest. With enough money we can bring the SHAPED app to Android as well. Below are some future goals we can achieve when we pass the funding levels required.
GOAL 1 - $30,000

LOCKED
Basic body scanning functions:
    User enters sex, height, age, and body shape/genetics (banana, apple, pear, hourglass). The app scans the body and gives back an image that is shaded to highlight the problem areas.
GOAL 2 - $70,000

LOCKED
Android support and additional app features:
    The user can press on problem areas and view HD Videos (Female or male) with their specific body type working that muscle group, customized nutritional advice, and data can be saved and monitored to track progress or failure. 
    This level of funding will also allow us to bring the app to the Android platform. This is a larger challenge that you might expect due to the diversity of Android devices. There are several different operating system versions and even more different types of cameras with different resolutions. If we reach this goal we will make it happen for our user's!
GOAL 3 - $150,000 

LOCKED
Clothes Scanner and Body Morph: 
    From the very beginning we wanted the app to scan user's clothes like it does for their bodies. We all want to know if our clothes fit right, or if those jeans are enhancing the butt in all the wrong ways... This is the hardest challenge of all, though. There are many different types of fashion and a lot of research needs to be done to mathematically model them in software for the analysis.

<p>It has always been just my mom and I. When I was little, I remember asking my mom ""Can I have a little brother or sister?"", but I guess, in a sense, I liked having her all to myself. Now, though, it would definitely help having a sibling to share this situation with.</p>
<p>My name is Heather. I am the only child of Charlette who, up to about one month ago, was the healthiest person I know. I am talking serious health nut: exercise 5 times a week, eating select food items, taking vitamins, and, even, passing on her health tips to friends and family! Who knew that after a mammogram 5 weeks ago, she’d find out she had a cancerous lump. After the biopsy results came back, she was told that she had Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma, 3.5 cm in diameter. Stage 2 Breast Cancer. After much research, consultation and prayer, she decided to have a double mastectomy with reconstructive plastic surgery following up with chemotherapy and hormonal therapy. Recovery time = up to 4 months. My world seemed to slowly fall apart day by day.</p>
<p>Being so far away from my mom (about 650 miles) puts me in a very vulnerable place. I want so much to be with her during this time (and I will for the surgery), but with having just begun graduate school, starting a new job, and moving to a new state - I struggle every day. I can only do so much for her, and it breaks my heart.</p>
<p>Since 2010, my mother has been affected by the deflated economy. She has been unemployed intermittently and has struggled finding full-time employment regardless of her over 12 years of paralegal experience. Unemployed and being diagnosed with cancer is a bit much to handle. The old adage “when it rains, it pours” started to ring true.</p>
<p>Just like anyone, my mom has bills and with the unemployment benefits at its end, rent, car insurance, groceries, utilities, etc., all still need to be paid. I am all she has. But, hopefully she has you too. I want my mom to spend her recovery time actually recovering, not worrying where to get an extra 5 bucks to keep the lights on. My goal is to help cover her monthly expenses for the entire time she is recovering; nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>I need your help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monetary donations are more than helpful. Prayers are appreciated as well.</li>
<li>I want this to spread, though, like a wild fire. You can do that by   passing on the link to this campaign on any social media network (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, etc.) that you use to your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, the mailman, whomever! See above. OR Email, “Snail” mail, and word of mouth are awesome as well. Anything to get the word out.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>I know there are many people whom struggle every day with different diseases; however, she is all I have, and I want to do my best by her as she has done for me all these years.  </p>
<p>We can’t change the past, but we can change the future. Pay it forward. Thank you in advance to everyone for your time, love, and support - what it means to me is indescribable.</p>

<p>We’re a 15-year digital agency focused on education and fun for families. Based in Brooklyn, NY, we’re also huge supporters of our community, specifically local schools and social action issues.</p>
<p>But, let’s face it, the Healthcare Industry and specifically the Health Insurance Industry, is an extremely difficult world to navigate, especially for families of all types not to mention those with fewer means. So, we’d like to build a FREE APP, available in both English and Spanish, providing critical information about changing healthcare legislation; and, particularly, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as The Affordable Care Act. For both lower income and those families hovering around the middle class, many life changing options will become available starting in 2014! But, how will any of us know how to take advantage of them? This app will help.</p>
<p>Your contribution helps us build a mobile app that anyone can use with any basic smartphone. Simply by answering a few basic questions, you can gain access to your rights to healthcare, according to the new Affordable Care Act. This app can save you countless dollars in health care costs, adding significantly to your quality of life and the lives of millions of others.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While costs for mobile apps are more affordable these days, making a great app that works for most smartphones, tackling such a huge endeavor like the Affordable Care Act requires investment. As a small business with big dreams, we need your support.</p>
<p>We plan on dedicating <strong>75%</strong> of our fundraising resources to the development of the app itself. Based on the work and research we’ve completed to date, we believe this is the right budget to build the best possible app solving the most difficult problems for families.</p>
<p>Our free app will be a very friendly, practical user experience guiding users to information as quickly and smoothly as possible.  Previously uninsured?  Here are your options.  Pre-existing conditions?  Here are your benefits.  Young families?   Yours.  Small business person struggling to afford healthcare?  Your benefits…and so on.</p>
<p>Further, given the enormous size and complexity of the Affordable Care Act, we plan to commit <strong>15%</strong> to research helping the average citizen cut through the intricacies of the bill with our app. Our experts will break down the bill into various scenarios crafted to help everyone with easy to comprehend language. The remaining funds, approximately <strong>10%</strong>, will be allocated to maintenance and support of the app after it launches.</p>
<p>In terms of perks, we want to give credit where credit is due.  Our team would love to share the credit for building a free tool for millions of insured and uninsured Americans who struggle to understand the best way to cover themselves and their families.  In this way, we all change our lives for the better – together.</p>

<h3>Note: Check the ""Updates"" tag for video updates!<br/><br/>Me!</h3>
<p>- ""Dysautonomia"" first became a part of my vocabulary in 2008 when I first got sick. That was senior year of high school. Secondary issues have been vast and troublesome and we're still chasing down an exact primary disorder. (My website is <a href=""http://www.flutedcupsandampersands.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.flutedcupsandampersands.com/</a> and there's a tab at the top that has a reeeeeeeeeeeally long version of my disease's story. But this campaign is about more than that.)</p>
<p>- Living in Alabama, I haven't always been near people who had the right information or other patients in similar situations. Joining online communities has helped me exponentially. I've come to have several relationships with people in similar (and not so similar) situations to my own. The internet helps bridge the gap between patients who might not otherwise know each other.<br/><br/>- I'm 23. I'm a senior in college and I do note differences between how I view things and how a lot of other e-patients view things. I have a unique perspective at times and I do think that I can contribute to the online health world. I believe that patients should take an active role in their health whenever possible and I believe that healthcare is moving towards a more technological based system. <a href=""http://participatorymedicine.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Participatory medicine</a> is important to me.</p>
<p>- I intend to follow in the footsteps of e-patients who have made an impact in the medical community and have helped better the entire system for everyone. Attending this symposium is a huge step towards that. There are reasons why I chose this conference over others. I'm extremely active on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, through my blog, and through various forums. I try to connect with people whenever possible and this is a chance for me to do that - in person!</p>
<p><br/><strong><em>If you have any questions at all - please feel free to ask.</em></strong> I'm not going to feel insulted. Almost nothing is off limits. Like...don't ask me what I'm wearing. That's weird, man. If I say ""our"" anywhere on this campaign, I'm generally talking about my best friend Taylor and myself. She's helping me with this whole thing and is pretty cool.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>------------------------------------------------------<br/>What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>- Look to the right! All those perks. Perk perk perk. Those could be allllll yours for the small price of...whatever the listed price is for that incentive!</p>
<p>- Don't see anything you want? You don't have to cash in on any of the incentives. You can simply invest. HOWEVER, we are more than willing to work with you to get you what you want, especially if you don't live nearby and want a more long distance friendly perk. There ARE perks listed for people who don't live near Northern Alabama, but there are less than the local perks. As long as it's not gross and creepy, we're game for negotiation. We understand that not everyone needs a tutor or wants to go to an amazing RayTay event with entertainment provided. If you're investing your time to spreading the word or investing your money to help this cause? You are a rockstar and you deserve our consideration and attention.</p>
<p>- Remember: Any of the incentives can be given away as gifts. Have a friend who has a million children but you want her/him to go out to the bar with you one night? Give her/him the gift of a babysitter. (And yes - for things like babysitting and tutoring, credibility and whatnot will all be approved by you beforehand.)</p>
<p>- Was the video interesting at all? Because if this is successful, we plan to give video updates on the whole process that will be mostly like the silly parts of the main pitch video.<br/><br/>------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>The Total Cost: $3,200<br/>I will be transparent and consistent with information regarding how the money is used and I'm willing to answer any questions regarding pecuniary matters.

- ""Dysautonomia"" first became a part of my vocabulary in 2008 when I first got sick. That was senior year of high school. Secondary issues have been vast and troublesome and we're still chasing down an exact primary disorder. (My website is http://www.flutedcupsandampersands.com/ and there's a tab at the top that has a reeeeeeeeeeeally long version of my disease's story. But this campaign is about more than that.)
- Living in Alabama, I haven't always been near people who had the right information or other patients in similar situations. Joining online communities has helped me exponentially. I've come to have several relationships with people in similar (and not so similar) situations to my own. The internet helps bridge the gap between patients who might not otherwise know each other.- I'm 23. I'm a senior in college and I do note differences between how I view things and how a lot of other e-patients view things. I have a unique perspective at times and I do think that I can contribute to the online health world. I believe that patients should take an active role in their health whenever possible and I believe that healthcare is moving towards a more technological based system. Participatory medicine is important to me.
- I intend to follow in the footsteps of e-patients who have made an impact in the medical community and have helped better the entire system for everyone. Attending this symposium is a huge step towards that. There are reasons why I chose this conference over others. I'm extremely active on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, through my blog, and through various forums. I try to connect with people whenever possible and this is a chance for me to do that - in person!
If you have any questions at all - please feel free to ask. I'm not going to feel insulted. Almost nothing is off limits. Like...don't ask me what I'm wearing. That's weird, man. If I say ""our"" anywhere on this campaign, I'm generally talking about my best friend Taylor and myself. She's helping me with this whole thing and is pretty cool.


------------------------------------------------------What's In It For You?
- Look to the right! All those perks. Perk perk perk. Those could be allllll yours for the small price of...whatever the listed price is for that incentive!
- Don't see anything you want? You don't have to cash in on any of the incentives. You can simply invest. HOWEVER, we are more than willing to work with you to get you what you want, especially if you don't live nearby and want a more long distance friendly perk. There ARE perks listed for people who don't live near Northern Alabama, but there are less than the local perks. As long as it's not gross and creepy, we're game for negotiation. We understand that not everyone needs a tutor or wants to go to an amazing RayTay event with entertainment provided. If you're investing your time to spreading the word or investing your money to help this cause? You are a rockstar and you deserve our consideration and attention.
- Remember: Any of the incentives can be given away as gifts. Have a friend who has a million children but you want her/him to go out to the bar with you one night? Give her/him the gift of a babysitter. (And yes - for things like babysitting and tutoring, credibility and whatnot will all be approved by you beforehand.)
- Was the video interesting at all? Because if this is successful, we plan to give video updates on the whole process that will be mostly like the silly parts of the main pitch video.------------------------------------------------------------------
The Total Cost: $3,200I will be transparent and consistent with information regarding how the money is used and I'm willing to answer any questions regarding pecuniary matters.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Howrah South Point (HSP) is an Indian organisation looking after kids in serious poverty. Many of these kids have also been born with congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV) or clubfeet. As part of trying to provide these kids a better future, HSP has invited a team to provide operations to kids who would otherwise not have this option. Over 2 weeks, the kids will be given the chance to walk normally, opening up a new future for them. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking to provide as many funds as possible to support this trip and provide funds for the ongoing treatment of these children. Funds will be used to purchase the medicines, plaster, dressings and other medical equipment that will be used to look after the kids. And if there's any funds left over, we'll donate all of that to Howrah South Point to help support the ongoing care of these kids (and the other kids they look after). </p>
<p>What does your money provide:</p>
<p>$10 would be enough to provide the necessary plasters for one of the kids.</p>
<p>$20 would be enough to provide anaesthesia for one of the operations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, if you contribute even a small amount, you will be part of changing the life of one of these kids (with accompanying warm inner glow guaranteed).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And naturally, there's the opportunity to share in some of the perks to commemmorate your contribution.</p>
<p>$25 or more - this gives you a place on our website honour roll.</p>
<p>$50 or more - as well as the above, we'll send a photo from the trip, giving you a permanent memento of the smile you were a part of.</p>
<p> $100 or more - as well as both of these, we'll send on something handmade from Howrah South Point. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These kids face some big hurdles in their lives, coming from a background where $2 a might be a day's pay. Hampered by the shape of their lower limbs, their mobility will always be limited. It can be harder to get an education, and then hard to find work. An operation can change that future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the third time this team has been invited back. Over the last 2 trips, we've helped more than 60 kids walk into a different future. We've seen the smiles on their faces when they come back to visit, and heard their stories from school and the sporting fields. </p>

dread, and don't know what else to do. Nothing is sustainable anymore, 
moving HAS to happen, and a big move at that. I need to move from 
Seattle to Portland (Beaverton or Vancouver WA for affordability &amp;

 now there is nowhere that we could live within our means, and moving 
around in the city would waste money, I need a BIG move to somewhere

and pay friends since I cannot pack or move myself (Moving 2 miles 2 
years ago cost more than 5k, and moving to another state could be 10k or
 more - more recent estimates are less, but it is ~2.5tons according to our 
last move, I think, and we might save some money if we use pods). So basically, I need to raise even more so I can 
try to offer a very large deposit of several months rent or more to try 
to convince anyone to rent to us. We have a good history, no evictions

that during renovations to the building I live in, we were served an illegal eviction notice and the city forced them 
to rescind it, but after the 90 day freeze that was put on the owners 
here, I imagine they will try again. So I have maybe 90 days to come up 
with enough funding to move. I may have less if construction horrors 
continue to happen (please read the link above re: flooding, safety 
issues, etc.). Currently the 90 day hold on eviction issuance ends in early November (extended because they broke rules again).</b><br/><br/>The constant extra pressures: <br/><br/>Figure
 out rent for however much longer we're here (Because of the illegal eviction notice we are currently frozen at ~1200, but they are chomping at the bit to raise it to 1700). The sooner I get a large

paying bills here. Pay the outstanding utilities (also because 
other than just being overdue to a point where they may be able to legally evict us, it may prevent us from renting somewhere 
else if we have outstanding utilities): Electric is currently paid, 
Cable is about 80 and W/S/G is down to about 400, maybe less if they either find the credit that's missing (but if it isn't missing, there might be fraud, then we're still at ~400). (If cable and electric don't stay on, neither of us can do 
what we do to earn money, they will not shut off the water but it will

 The last couple of years have been tough, and getting tougher still. I 
spent almost all of 2013 being sick, and injured, and I'm not in a good 
place physically. With each passing month bills only get higher while I 
have less and less ways to do anything for it. I'm full of panic and 
dread, and don't know what else to do. Nothing is sustainable anymore, 
moving HAS to happen, and a big move at that. I need to move from

 be bus service to my current neighborhood come fall, and it may be

The sliding door has been like this from the start of construction, they're had it in and out, and right now it's in, but the door itself is loose...And we're apparently expected to live with the blinds like this until they're done (All the construction was supposed to be 3 weeks, but as I write this we're ending the 8th week...)Another week when they left for a weekend without setting up rain protection, I put tarps out and fixed it myself, but come Monday they took the tarps and used them for themselves.

We have to do this most days in order to NOT be forced to inhale drugs.The new windows have been like this for weeks now.Before they did the windows, this was the notice we were given.

<h1>HOW DOES
IT WORK?</h1>
<br/></span></h2><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>Nature
is full of beneficial substances for your body. We made <span>Otomi Workout Recovery Wax from only <b><i>natural</i> herbal oil
extracts</b>; it doesn´t have any mineral oil extracts. For us, it is important
that our products are natural; as a matter of fact, you can eat the wax and
nothing bad will happen to you. <b>We don´t use any petroleum-</b><b>based ingredients.</b> </span></p>
<p>We
only use high-quality ingredients. The beeswax comes from bee farmers, and
almost every plant that we use comes from small communities in Mexico. The
cold-pressed oils in our products are subtracted from these plants. </p>
<p>We
use ginger,mint<a href=""#_msocom_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>,
honey, beeswax, and grape and avocado seeds among other ingredients in our
formula, all of them natural. These ingredients will nourish and relax the body
parts you worked out. We also use some natural anesthetic plant extracts that
will help reduce the natural pain you feel after an intense workout.</p>
<p>Through
your skin, your body takes away what you don´t need. And through the same skin,
you can also take in what you <i>do</i>
need. Otomi Workout Recovery Wax will fulfill that role and nourish and protect
your muscles naturally. Did we mention it smells great?</p>

I care about them, I care about their health and I really care about creating healthy products that they can safely use. They are the motivation behind all that I do. For a number of years I have been developing natural personal care products for client companies. The problem with most of these corporations is that they are huge and impersonal, and they often include harmful ingredients in their formulas.                                                 Knowing that most deodorants are not good for you to use, my team has worked to develop a deodorant that not only eliminates odors, but is actually beneficial to use. And FINALLY, we've cracked the code!We have created a natural deodorant that actually works and is long lasting. Many people who love to use natural and organic products, have told us that they have been unable to find a natural deodorant that really works. Many of the deodorants they have tried over promise and under deliver.                                                                                                            Skin meets Nature's™ totally natural deodorant is different. First of all, it works and is long lasting. Secondly, unlike most deodorants it is CHEMICAL FREE!The formula has been mastered. We have some fanatically loyal customers. The problem is that we need funds to produce this product in larger quantities to keep up with demand. A second problem we face is that there are Billion dollar companies who currently manufacture and sell deodorant on a massive level.    These corporations have power. Power to steal a formula like ours and make it their own. They are GOLIATH and we are David. They can easily crush us.With adequate funding, we will be able to properly guard and protect our intellectual property. We will be able to patent our formula.                                                                                           With your help Skin Meets Nature™ will become a thriving business, able to produce enough product to keep you smelling sweet. We will be able to keep the giants off of our door step and out of our kitchen. We will be protected.                         Please take a moment to contribute financially, call friends, share on social sites, LIKE us on facebook, order product, ENJOY smelling good!!How your funds will help us HELP YOU:
We need to raise a minimum of: 
$15,000 USD in order to successfully launch this product and business. 
$30,000 would get us up and running at a quicker pace. 

$75,000 would help us acquire more equipment, which would enable us to sell in more stores.

$100,000 would provide local jobs, and we would be able to build relationships with indigenous farmers around the world and ensure that we are Sourcing genuine Fair Trade ingredients.

LATY is a brand that creates mindfully designed and timeless products that will last a lifetime without compromising beauty or functionality. The BHUMI MAT will improve any practitioners' alignment and posture consistency thanks to specific, low profile visual cues. Additionally, due to cork's amazing natural properties, it will provide you the essential grounding energy (so important!) in our busy daily lives.


                                                  ········································



We asked advanced yoga instructors what they thought the number one issue was in yoga, they overwhelmingly responded.. alignment! Even in advanced classes where the flow goes fast, instructors notice how challenging consistent and correct alignment can be. That is why LATY collaborated with highly advanced yoga teachers to create designs based on accurate posture and alignment. The result is the BHUMI MAT in three timeless, subtle and attractive designs where key posture reference points are provided.

Studies show that more than 65 million Americans suffer from back pain. But with longer work hours and more people working from home, most of us are sitting more than ever. The Leband Electric Sit-Stand Desk gives you the freedom to get off your chair and onto your feet, while still getting plenty done. It features a quiet but powerful electric motor, and X-Type slide track technology that can adjust to any height you need. So you can make use of any spot in the house to get more done, comfortably. With one-touch electric lifting, you’ll never have to struggle with levers or lift your desk into place. And once you find the sweet spot for your workflow, the Leband will memorize your height settings for the next time you come back. Your sofa. Your kitchen table. The desk in your office. With the Leband’s light and portable design, any surface can become your new workspace. Where you can do what you do best while avoiding neck and back pain from too much awkward sitting.Work is tough. But creating a great workspace should be easy. The Leband is light, portable, and easy to move, so you can place it on any surface, in any room. From your desk, to the coffee table, to the kitchen counter, it lets you turn any room into an ideal workspace for every family member. Already have a standing desk? Compared with the traditional standing desk, the Leband is a desk converter featuring a lightweight compact design without taking up extra floor space. You have the freedom to work where you feel most comfortable, and customize to any height you need.Think better on your feet? The Leband Electric Sit-Stand Desk can be adjusted to fit any height. Whether you’re standing up firing off emails at your desk. Or polishing your masterpiece at a coffee table. So you can spend less time looking for the sweet spot, and more time in the zone getting your best work done.Get busy doing great work. Not busy lifting. Bulky, gas powered standing desks are a hassle to lift and can feel outdated. The Leband is electric powered, so it does all the lifting for you. Just press the button, and let it rise to the exact height you need. This desk works almost as hard as you. Almost. No more heavy lifting or gas-powered levers to get your desk into place. With one-touch lifting, the Leband does the work for you. A low phone battery can quickly kill your workflow. That’s why the Leband features a wireless device charging surface. Just place your phone on the Leband desk, and let it charge while you work. No need for cords and plugs. Did somebody say convenience?If you’re like us, you probably count on several devices to get the job done. The Leband features a built in USB port for convenient device charging at any time. So you can keep going when it matters most.Most standing desks are so massive, they take over your entire workspace. The Leband is compact enough to fit anywhere, but wide enough to hold your work essentials. From your laptop and mouse, to your pens, and of course your favorite coffee mug. Everything is right there in arms reach.Finding the right place to be productive at home can be tough. The Leband Electric Standing desk gets you there with one touch. Once you find the perfect height setting for your workflow, the Leband will memorize it for the next time you come back. So you spend less time fiddling with settings, and more time in the sweet spot doing what you do best.Sometimes our home offices have visitors. The Leband’s Child Lock function keeps your children and your workplace safe at all times. After three minutes of inactivity, a red light will flash and the Leband will lock into place. So you don’t have to worry about it rising or lowering with children around. Or curious hands getting into your confidential files.Got a heavy workload? With a 33lbs weight capacity, the Leband is stable and sturdy enough to hold it all. Whether it’s your monitor, a stack of books, or 14 laptops piled on top of each other. Yep… we tried that, too.Life is unpredictable. That’s why the Leband’s surface is built strong to take the bumps. It features a scratch resistant surface in case of unexpected visitors… even the furry kind. And we also made it super-easy to clean. So sip that coffee and get into the zone, without stressing about the little things. Nothing ruins your mood like a tangle of cords. With our integrated cable management system, cord tangles are never a problem. No more sifting through a thousand USB cables to find the right one. Everything is tidy, organized, and right where it should be.It’s no secret kids love to explore. That’s why the Leband features rounded corners to keep little ones protected. They’re safer than the sharp corners used on most desks, meaning you don’t need to worry about little ones bumping into it while exploring. Our silicone table foot pads also protect your table-tops and other furniture from scratches. So you can relocate the Leband without worrying about scuffing up the table. Sometimes long hours of sitting are unavoidable. The Leband lumbar back support keeps your back healthy for the long haul. It features a dual torsion spring design to give you the firmness you need. While still being soft enough that you can relax. And one-key lift makes it a breeze to adjust no matter your height or weight. If you take care of your neck and back, they’ll take care of you. The Leband massage sticker helps keep your neck and back muscles loose, relaxed, and ready to go the distance. So you can keep performing at your best, day after day. With 5 different massage modes and 10 unique massage strengths, you can treat your muscles to the care they need. You work hard all day. Your neck and back deserve the best. Leband, a leading brand under Xiaomi ecosystem, belongs to OGAWA Group, which is Asia's largest massage equipment company as well as the world’s largest massage appliance production base.

What is Craniosynostosis?

Craniosynostosis (from cranio, cranium; + syn, together; + ostosis relating to bone) is a condition in which one or more of the fibrous sutures in an infant skull prematurely fuses by ossification, thereby changing the growth pattern of the skull. Because the skull cannot expand perpendicular to the fused suture, it compensates by growing more in the direction parallel to the closed sutures. Sometimes the resulting growth pattern provides the necessary space for the growing brain, but results in an abnormal head shape and abnormal facial features. In cases in which the compensation does not effectively provide enough space for the growing brain, craniosynostosis results in increased intracranial pressure leading possibly to visual impairment, sleeping impairment, eating difficulties, or an impairment of mental development combined with a significant reduction in IQ.
Craniosynostosis occurs in one in 2000 births. Craniosynostosis is part of a syndrome in 15 to 40% of the patients, but it usually occurs as an isolated condition. It is important that families seek out the opinion of a Pediatric Craniofacial Physician who has experience with craniosynostosis for proper diagnosis, surgical care, and followup.
The infant's skull consists of the metopic suture, coronal sutures, sagittal suture, and lambdoid sutures. The metopic suture is supposed to close between three to nine months of age. The lambdoid, sagittal and coronal sutures are supposed to close between 22 to 39 years of age.

<p>Here is what lead to our decision:</p>
<p><strong>Choices, Choices and More Choices: </strong>The Scrum sled market is pretty saturated. There are a lot of options out there. Sleds ranged from the basic model that we all know and love to machines that move on their own, are hydraulically powered, and tell you how hard you engaged (Set for all you young players). These machines range from $2000 to $15,000. So we had plenty of options to weigh when making our choice.</p>
<p><strong>Our Criteria for a Sled: </strong>When picking a sled we came up with a list of 5 things that we felt would benefit the undergraduate club long term and solved some of the issues the old sled had</p>
<ol>
<li>Vertical Pads, each moving independently. All of our previous sleds fell short here. This allows the sled to mimic the real feel of a scrum more accurately</li>
<li>Grips located for props to practice correct binding technique.</li>
<li>Ability to upgrade the sled with new and improved parts. Plus this allows us to continue to give to club</li>

Im transgender, which means Im a dude born in a chicks body.Im now taking medical steps to help me escape my female body so I can live as the guy I was always ment to be. Im starting male hormones in two months from now. Hormones will give me a deep voice, a more masculine physique and facial hair, but sadly i wont grow a penis and my man boobs won't magically fall off. :(</p>
<p>I am currently saving up for top surgery( surgery to remove my female breasts) Because you know..what kind of guy wants boobs? This surgery costs 6'500, I now have 2'000 saved up at the moment. Being only 18 years old and working at a fast food chain resturant, getting enough money for this surgery Is taking me a very long time. As you can imagine, being a guy trapped in a girls body isn't always easy, everytime I get dressed, or look in the mirror im forced to see my female chest.

<p>Not only will getting this surgery FINALLY allow me to look in the mirror with a smile on my face, but it will also allow me to live more comfortably. I'll finaly be able to go to the beach shirtless, something I only dreamed of doing since I was five years old. No longer would I be self conciecous worrying if people can see my hidden female chest, which I bind daily using a binder (a very tight compression shirt) or worrying everytime someone hugs me or taps me on the shoulder if they felt it. This surgery would help give me the confidence I need to go out in the world and live my life to its full potential. </p>
<p>Waiting for this surgery is very hard for me, which is why im trying to raise the money needed. Any amount no matter how BIG or how SMALL I would be forever thankful for..Words can't express my gradtitude and appreciation for any help given! Even spreading the word by sharing my video would help me loads! </p>
<p>Thank you very much! - Hugo Landry</p></div>","Hi, i'm Hugo! Im transgender, which means Im a dude born in a chicks body.Im now taking medical steps to help me escape my female body so I can live as the guy I was always ment to be. Im starting male hormones in two months from now. Hormones will give me a deep voice, a more masculine physique and facial hair, but sadly i wont grow a penis and my man boobs won't magically fall off. :(
I am currently saving up for top surgery( surgery to remove my female breasts) Because you know..what kind of guy wants boobs? This surgery costs 6'500, I now have 2'000 saved up at the moment. Being only 18 years old and working at a fast food chain resturant, getting enough money for this surgery Is taking me a very long time. As you can imagine, being a guy trapped in a girls body isn't always easy, everytime I get dressed, or look in the mirror im forced to see my female chest. Most guys are privileged to be born with a body that matches their mind, but for me I wasnt so lucky.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Let Go... Let Peace Come In Foundation was founded in 2008 by Peter S. Pelullo.  A survivor himself, Pete recognized that while there are many organizations scattered throughout the US to help children who experience sexual abuse there are no real resources for adults to help them heal from their childhood sexual abuse trauma.</p>
<p>Since its inception the organization has worked to provide a platform for survivors to find their voice and share their stories via the foundation's website <a href=""http://www.letgoletpeacecomein.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.letgoletpeacecomein.org</a>.  It has also aligned with the number one public health school in the world to support pioneering intitatives focused on prevention, early intervention, research, and access to a higher quality of care for survivors.</p>
<p>Child sexual abuse is more common than you think and it can occur within the family or by individuals outside the home.  1 in 3 girls and 1 in 4 boys will experience at least one sexual violation before the age of 18.  </p>
<p>It only takes one time---one sexual violation to change the life course of a survivor.  The long-term emotional and psychological damage resulting from child sexual abuse can be devastating to survivors and those who care about them most.</p>
<p>By supporting the Let Go... Let Peace Come In Foundation you will be saving lives.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently the foundation is working on all fronts to raise more than $3 million to support its prevention, intervention, research, and care initiatives.  This social funding campaign is one component of an overall funding strategy aimed at bringing healing, recovery, and scientific knowledge to the survivor community. </p>
<p>In addition to the changing the world through knowledge and the prospect of revolutionizing the public policy landscape thanks to our alignment with the number one public health school in the world, the foundation also directly subsidizes trauma therapy treatment for adult survivors who do not have the means or adequate insurance to begin their own healing process.</p>
<p>The Let Go... Let Peace Come In Foundation was the only organization to reach out to and offer treatment to the young men affected by the perpetrations of Jerry Sandusky.  Two of the young men who testified in court received therapy subsidies from the foundation for counseling and a third young man who did not testify as part of the original grand jury preceedings is also currently receiving subsidy assistance from the foundation for his therapy sessions.  All three of these young men have expressed their gratitude for the support and care that the foundation has provided them.  One of them is featured in the campaign video clip above.</p>
<p>Contributors who donate at least $500 will received a signed copy of Peter S. Pelullo's book <em>Betrayal and the Beast: A true story of one man's journey through childhood sexual abuse, sexual adiction, and recover</em>y.  In his memoir Pete reveals his own sexual violations as a child and describes how for 48 years he lived a disconnected double life rife with addictions in spite of his professional success.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With more than 60 million survivors existing the in US today and millions more across the globe each of us know a survivor and we probably know more than one.</p>
<p>These survivors are not just the downtrodden people living on the margins of society they are also successful business people, parents, and even adult children who have never spoken about their violations, but continue to exist in a life that could at a moments notice be triggered by a smell, a sound, a situation, or even the development of their own child.  Without organizations like the Let Go... Let Peace Come In Foundation that provide a voice for those who have been silenced these individuals will struggle in a society that expects them to just ""get over it"".  </p>
<p>The ubiquitous nature of child sexual abuse increases the possibility that our children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews will marry someone who has experienced sexual abuse in their lifetime.  The time to stop the cycle is now.</p>
<p>Since 2010 the foundation has raised enough funds to subsidize therapy sessions for 15 survivors in four states, but we need to do more.  On average one therapy session with a qualified trauma therapist costs about $100.  With your support we can help ""one survivor at a time"".  Additionally we have also raised more than $200,000 toward the advancement of prevention, intervention, research, and care efforts.  </p>

In order to grow as well as possible she needs one surgery in Russia a year. After each surgery follows  long period of costly rehabilitation. She needs tutors for maths and language, because she can't follow the school curriculum like the rest of her classmatesThere are some unique perks.
If we don't reach the goal, all the money collected will go to the cause nevertheless, but we shall try to compensate the rest from other sources


This is a story about a girl which, beside all hardships that she faces in her life, loves life and enjoyes it! Lara was born prematurely in 29th gestation week, almost three months earlier than she was supposed to. For three months she was in the neonatological hospital in an incubator. As a consequence she has cerebral paralysis, bronchial asthma and epilepsy. Her eye sight is also damaged from the oxygen in the incubator. Right side hemiparesys doesn't allow her to grow up equally, so she needs to have surgical interventions once a year to allow her right body side to develop as equally as possible to the left side. Those surgeries are performed in Tula, Russia and have to be paid. This way we are trying to collect the money for her surgeries and treatments that need to follow them THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOU HELP!!!

 
This is Lara's Facebook page, where you can find out all the details:

We are the University of Michigan's quidditch team! Since Fall 2010, we've bonded over a love of Harry Potter, athletics, and defeating our enemies in wizard duels.</div>

<h2>How else have you fundraised?</h2>
<p>We've been hard at work raising money for this since the season started in September. We have frequent t-shirt sales (our main source of income) around campus along with bake sales. </p>
<p>Our big effort was our Yule Ball, a campus wide dance that we hosted in January of this year. We provided wizard themed food and music for over 350 students and split the profits with USAAC, a local cancer research organization.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where the Money Goes</h2>
<p>Despite our great success in the past, we still receive NO funding from the University. As of now, we've been running fundraisers since September to help lessen the cost of the World Cup to our players. Unfortunately each of them is still paying $500 out of pocket to pay for transport, accomodations, food, and equipment.</p>
<p>If we were to meet our goal, we would be able to help lessen the total cost for all players. Additionally, some members aren't able to come because the event is simply too expensive. With enough of your support, we would be able to subsidize their trip even further, allowing them to participate!</p>
<p>Ideally we'll have enough money to give each needing member $100 to help them play the game they love. If we make more? Even more support for our players!</p>

</div>My Life is the heart and soul of Daily Companion.  It keeps you active and alert to your daily health requirements, while also providing critical health information to EMTs in the event of an emergency.  Below are some of its important applications:<div> 

<p align=""left""><b>- Critical Health Information Profile (CHIP) Application</b></p>
<div align=""center"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1095976/files/20141214135423-critical-info.jpg?1418594063"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>
<br/>
<p align=""left"">The Critical Health Information Profile (CHIP) stores and displays your vital health information on your Base Station and Smartphone for paramedics when a crisis arises.  No longer do paramedics have to search the home for pill jars and health information.  It’s right there in front of them!  This special feature includes:  (1) Personal Contact Information including your primary doctor, pharmacy and emergency contacts, (2) Medical History including recent health status, chronic diseases, illnesses, operations, and treatments, (3) Allergies and Reactions including immunizations, (4) Medications and prescriptions, and (5) Fax capability allowing paramedics to fax the information to the receiving hospital before you arrive.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>- Wellness and Medical Reminder Application</b></p>

The application provides daily pop-up screens to help remind you of important daily wellness and medication events such as scheduled medication intake or performance, drink water, eat meals, snacks, walk dog, park visit and special events such as birthdays, anniversaries or doctor visits and many more.  </p>
<p align=""left""><b>- Nurse-On-Call application</b></p>

<p align=""left"">Nurse on Call:  For any questions about health, seniors can press a button and get instant access to a registered nurse who can help them with questions regarding their health.</p>
<p align=""left"">Other applications included in My Life are: ‘Company’ contact information, and ‘I.D.’ the ability to leave your own personal message and snapshot for the CHIP.
</p>
<p align=""left""><b>The Emergency Communications System (ECS)</b></p>
<p align=""left"">Daily Companion’s TeleCare System comes with an Emergency Communication System (ECS) that is second to none.  The ECS is composed of three critically important healthcare applications: (1) The Call 911 to Call Center App and (2) the Emergency Notification System App and (3) the extractable CHIP memory stick.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>- Call 911</b></p>
<div align=""center"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1095991/files/20141214140240-911.jpg?1418594560"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>
<p align=""left"">By pressing the 911-button on the base station, wireless remote transmitter, or smartphone, you will receive immediate access to our Central Station where International Academy Emergency Dispatch-trained Daily Companion Assistants will help them with their crisis.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>- Extractable CHIP Memory Stick</b></p>
<div align=""center"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1009444/files/20141112141727-DC-13.jpg?1415830647"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Extractable CHIP Memory Stick<br/> </div>
<p align=""left"">The Home Base Station comes with a removable memory stick that contains your Critical Health Information Profile so that paramedics can transport your important health information to the receiving hospital even before you arrive.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>-  Emergency QR System</b></p>
<p align=""left"">Daily Companion’s patent-pending emergency QR system allows paramedics, using their computer tablet and our specialized Quick Response Scanner Software, to instantly down your medical information from the Base Station or your Smartphone right onto their system enabling even quicker protocol response to your crisis.  Here is how the system functions:</p>

<br/>
<p align=""left""><b>- Emergency Notification System</b></p>

The Emergency Notification System works behind the scenes on from the Home Base Station or Smartphone.  When the ECS system is activated, Daily Companion’s TeleCare system automatically places a call or text an alert message to those listed on your emergency notification list letting them know that your system has been activated.  Here is an example of the voice message<br/><br/><p align=""left""><b>OTHER FEATURED APPLICATIONS</b></p>
<p align=""left"">Daily Companion’s TeleCare system provides an array of features designed to keep you involved with the world, these include:</p>
<p><b>- Today</b></p>
<div align=""center"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1095998/files/20141214140718-today2.jpg?1418594838"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>
<p align=""left"">'Today' provides the user daily-updated brain-challenging exercises.  It’s important to keep your loved one’s brain active and engaged.  That’s why we’ve incorporated a suite of daily (automatic) downloads of new stimulating exercises such as ‘Word’, ‘Inspirational Messages’, ‘Quotes’, ‘Trivia’, ‘Lottery Numbers’, ‘My Sign Horoscope’ and ‘History’.  In the future, we plan on adding crossword puzzles, Sudoku, Solitare, and many others to help improve the mental health of our users.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>- Phone Book</b></p>
<div align=""center"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1009458/files/20141112142039-DC-16.jpg?1415830839"" src="""" style=""""/>
<br/>Phone Book and Dialer Screen<br/> </div>
<p align=""left"">Phone Book is an application accessible on many pages is ‘Phone’, a system that includes an address book that is downloaded from the Daily Companion profile that you’ve created for your senior parent.  With a touch of the face or name in the scrollable address book, the number is instantly dialed. When using the touch pad to dial a number, the number is announced for confirmation when touched.</p>
<p align=""left""><b>- Inactivity Notification</b></p>
<p align=""left"">As children of senior parents, we’re always concerned about the possibility of our parents having a stroke and no one is there to help them.  Sometimes seniors don’t get help for days… often ending in a bad situation.  Well, not any more.  Daily Companion’s TeleCare system provides the capability to monitor and report the ‘inactivity’ of the user.  The account holder can select a 24, 36 or 48 hour observation and can be notified of non-use.  Just one more way Daily Companion ensures the health and safety of the ones we love. </p>
<p align=""left""><b>PERSONALIZE YOUR DAILY COMPANION!</b></p>

Main TeleCare Screen 

MY LIFE:  PERSONAL CARE APPLICATIONS


My Life is the heart and soul of Daily Companion.  It keeps you active and alert to your daily health requirements, while also providing critical health information to EMTs in the event of an emergency.  Below are some of its important applications: 

- Critical Health Information Profile (CHIP) Application




The Critical Health Information Profile (CHIP) stores and displays your vital health information on your Base Station and Smartphone for paramedics when a crisis arises.  No longer do paramedics have to search the home for pill jars and health information.  It’s right there in front of them!  This special feature includes:  (1) Personal Contact Information including your primary doctor, pharmacy and emergency contacts, (2) Medical History including recent health status, chronic diseases, illnesses, operations, and treatments, (3) Allergies and Reactions including immunizations, (4) Medications and prescriptions, and (5) Fax capability allowing paramedics to fax the information to the receiving hospital before you arrive.
- Wellness and Medical Reminder Application

 

'Remind' is the Wellness and Medication Reminder application.  The application provides daily pop-up screens to help remind you of important daily wellness and medication events such as scheduled medication intake or performance, drink water, eat meals, snacks, walk dog, park visit and special events such as birthdays, anniversaries or doctor visits and many more.  
- Nurse-On-Call application

Nurse on Call:  For any questions about health, seniors can press a button and get instant access to a registered nurse who can help them with questions regarding their health.
Other applications included in My Life are: ‘Company’ contact information, and ‘I.D.’ the ability to leave your own personal message and snapshot for the CHIP.

The Emergency Communications System (ECS)
Daily Companion’s TeleCare System comes with an Emergency Communication System (ECS) that is second to none.  The ECS is composed of three critically important healthcare applications: (1) The Call 911 to Call Center App and (2) the Emergency Notification System App and (3) the extractable CHIP memory stick.
- Call 911



By pressing the 911-button on the base station, wireless remote transmitter, or smartphone, you will receive immediate access to our Central Station where International Academy Emergency Dispatch-trained Daily Companion Assistants will help them with their crisis.
- Extractable CHIP Memory Stick

Extractable CHIP Memory Stick 
The Home Base Station comes with a removable memory stick that contains your Critical Health Information Profile so that paramedics can transport your important health information to the receiving hospital even before you arrive.
-  Emergency QR System
Daily Companion’s patent-pending emergency QR system allows paramedics, using their computer tablet and our specialized Quick Response Scanner Software, to instantly down your medical information from the Base Station or your Smartphone right onto their system enabling even quicker protocol response to your crisis.  Here is how the system functions:



- Emergency Notification System

The Emergency Notification System works behind the scenes on from the Home Base Station or Smartphone.  When the ECS system is activated, Daily Companion’s TeleCare system automatically places a call or text an alert message to those listed on your emergency notification list letting them know that your system has been activated.  Here is an example of the voice messageOTHER FEATURED APPLICATIONS
Daily Companion’s TeleCare system provides an array of features designed to keep you involved with the world, these include:
- Today



'Today' provides the user daily-updated brain-challenging exercises.  It’s important to keep your loved one’s brain active and engaged.  That’s why we’ve incorporated a suite of daily (automatic) downloads of new stimulating exercises such as ‘Word’, ‘Inspirational Messages’, ‘Quotes’, ‘Trivia’, ‘Lottery Numbers’, ‘My Sign Horoscope’ and ‘History’.  In the future, we plan on adding crossword puzzles, Sudoku, Solitare, and many others to help improve the mental health of our users.
- Phone Book


Phone Book and Dialer Screen 
Phone Book is an application accessible on many pages is ‘Phone’, a system that includes an address book that is downloaded from the Daily Companion profile that you’ve created for your senior parent.  With a touch of the face or name in the scrollable address book, the number is instantly dialed. When using the touch pad to dial a number, the number is announced for confirmation when touched.
- Inactivity Notification
As children of senior parents, we’re always concerned about the possibility of our parents having a stroke and no one is there to help them.  Sometimes seniors don’t get help for days… often ending in a bad situation.  Well, not any more.  Daily Companion’s TeleCare system provides the capability to monitor and report the ‘inactivity’ of the user.  The account holder can select a 24, 36 or 48 hour observation and can be notified of non-use.  Just one more way Daily Companion ensures the health and safety of the ones we love.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Melissa Klein. I am 21 years old and I was diagnosed with <b>Mitochondrial Neurogastrointestinal Encephalopathy (MNGIE)</b> in December 2012. MNGIE is an autosomal recessive disorder that has no known cure. It affects the digestive and nervous system, including symptoms such as:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>hearing loss</li>
<li>peripheral neuropathy, leukoencephalopathy (white matter)</li>
<li>ptosis</li>
<li>dysmotility</li>
<li>dysphagia (trouble swallowing)</li>
<li>nausea, vomiting</li>
<li>diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain</li>
<li>intestinal blockage</li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>malabsorption</li>
<li>extreme weight loss</li>
<li>muscle weakness, reduced muscle mass</li>
</ul>
<p>I have developed all of these symptoms, and my quality of life is slowly getting worse. They say MNGIE patients usually pass on in their mid-30's, but I have been told that I won't make it that far.</p>
<p>I have been to NYC to see Dr. Michio Hirano, back in January, to see if he could help me with his clinical trial. However, because I also suffer from diverticulitis, I was considered high risk and ineligible and could not participate. Hirano informed me that there was being more research done in London, and it would more than likely reach the states in a few years, but after contacting Dr. Bax, I feel like this is my last chance, and I need to have this treatment done as soon as I can!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Research is being done and clinical trials are being held, however funding is scarce. The treatment I am working towards is called <b>erythrocyte encapsulated thymidine phosphorylase (EE-TP)</b> and is designed to ""fix the molecular defect behind MNGIE by replacing thymidine phosphorylase, the deficient enzyme, by encapsulating it within the patient's own erythocytes <i>in vitro,</i> and then returning these to the patient.""<br/></p>
<p>This treatment is being given compassionately, meaning the patients must provide funding themselves in order to pay for it. Two patients (that I am aware of) have received this treatment, and have both experienced amazing results. The cost of EE-TP would be about $6,100 a month, and this campaign is meant for one month and the travel costs for my husband and I.</p>
<p>When you donate, not only are you doing me a huge favor, but you are saving my life. I don't have much, but I would love to say thanks by providing a few perks that are all unique and very personal. If I could pay each and every one of you back, I would do that and more.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>All custom perks will be discussed via email, since that's the easiest way to contact me.</b></h3>
<p><b>Please email me at melissa.klein3@gmail.com</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I were to reach my goal, I would be able to travel to London with my husband, meet Dr. Bridget Bax, and be able to undergo the EE-TP treatment that could slow down the progression of my disease and prolong my lifespan.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know my goal is high, and I know that with today's economy, not everyone can donate to a cause like mine. And even though every dollar helps, it would also help me immensely if you spread the word! Some ways you could help me by only spending a minute or two of your time are:</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Our dear friend Calixto desperately needs back surgery he can't afford. For those of you who know Calixto, you know how selfless, warm, and generous he is. Most of you know that he has been having trouble with his back 
for several years, but has continued to work through intense pain.  He has been to 
different doctors in Santa Cruz and was told he needed 
surgery.  It is my understanding that he was put on the list for surgery 
three years ago and he is still waiting.  Unfortunately he is out of 
time and it takes forever to 
get care if you are only able to use the public (caja) system.  

 

Calixto has been taken by ambulance to the 
hospital on four occasions. He 
returns to La Buena Vida and continues to work and attempts things he shouldn't 
for residents and guests.  His work ethic and his desire to do his 
job is so strong.  He has continued to do his normal daily duties but 
he is in pain.  He's worried about his job....one that he wants to 
do, but frustratingly can't without injuring himself further or living with a lot 
of pain.   
 
His good friend Barbara took it upon herself to get an appointment with a private doctor in San Jose and accompanied Calixto for 
the initial appointment so she could know first hand the extent of his 
problem. He had an MRI and the neurosurgeon determined that he had a 
problem with a hernia between L4 and L5. 
 Calixto seldom is gone on his day off and 
doesn't take his vacation because he would rather work.  Renters come in and they all love him.  He takes good care of 
their needs and earns their respect.  Some of them have already voluntarily 
made generous offers of money to help.  I don't think I have to tell 
you how valuable he is to La Buena Vida and what a unique individual he 
is.    


The Impact

The doctor said he is in good health and his prognosis is very 
very good, but it is very serious and without surgery it will 
only get worse and could lead to paralysis or permanent nerve 
damage. The doctor can do microsurgery to perfectly correct his problem. Calixto will be up and walking the next 
day and back to work within two weeks doing his normal light every day 
duties. For the most part he will be back at in within two weeks. Going private the doctor can schedule the surgery for next Friday, February, Feb 
24th.  Barbara is here through March 2nd and can look out for him.  


What We Need & What You Get

The surgery cost including everything will be $8,500 to 
$9,000.  That's the hospital cost, the surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses, 
etc.  Plus hotel costs at $36 per night (includes breakfast and taxes) and 
some other meals and taxis.  In exchange for your generosity we can offer local portrait shoots, but if anyone has any products or services they could donate as incentives, that would be great!

Live Light stands for Living Light and being ""Free"" of gluten ,dairy and soy while also being vegetarian and eating clean, healthy, light foods. I have already started by altering and creating recipes to suit this lifestyle. </p>
<p>My <strong>current</strong> cookbook/ebook/Kindle book ""<em>Simply Gluten Dairy Free Baking: Plus, How to eliminate both from your diet in 3 easy steps.</em>"" has been a <strong>complete hit </strong><strong><em>(as well as the soy free edition)</em></strong> and I am looking to <strong>expand</strong> on it and create a cookbook featuring recipes that qualify under all categories: Appetizers, Snacks, Entrees, Desserts and Non-Alcoholic Beverages. (Not just desserts.)</p>
<p>Note: Not only will they be free of gluten, dairy, soy and meat- they will also be healthy, nutritious and good for you too. There will also be low sugar, low sodium options, and all will be preferably low glycemic. Some will even be free of nuts and/or eggs. And the book will feature a guide on how to eliminate them from your diet, similar to the one in my baking cookbook.</p>
<p>There will also be a full healthy living lifestyle guide.</p>
<p><strong>My philosophy</strong> is that you should <strong>never</strong> be deprived of the foods you love, simply because you have an allergy, sensitivity or specified or preferred way of life. You should be able to enjoy everything you love. And you should be able to eat healthy, light foods that are good for your body, mind &amp; soul.</p>
<p><strong>The funding will allow me to:</strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Cover the costs of ingredients</strong> to create these recipes (they are very expensive, because GF/DF/SF food is significantly more expensive than there conventional counterparts)</p>
<p>If each recipe costs me roughly $20 to make (and it only takes me one time to make it successfully) then I will need a minimum of over $6,000. Keep in mind it took me 8 loaves of bread before I made the successful loaf. It cost me roughly $80+ to make the bread recipe.</p>
<p>2. Cover the cost of the <strong>time</strong> it will take me to make this- over the next year. (Probably less than 1 year)</p>
<p>3. Allow me the ability to <strong>hire </strong>someone to <strong>edit, proof read</strong> and also create <strong>cover art </strong>for the cookbook. - As a photographer, I do all of the photography for the cookbook, which saves costs.</p>
<p> 4. It will also cover the costs of <strong>self-publishing</strong> to get you <strong><em>your copie</em></strong><strong>s</strong> of the book. And it will cover the cost of getting the book successfully published by a publisher.</p>

<p><strong>Why did I choose flexible funding?</strong></p>
<p>I chose flexible funding so I can use the funds that come in to make recipes and even if I don't meet my goal, I will still be able to use the funds donated to create as much as I can with what I raised. Plus, I will still be able to send you the copies of your books that you get.</p>

<p>Good question! My goal is<strong> 300</strong> or more- (that is why it is going to take so long.)

The other is a book called ""The Little Book of Manifesting"" (Learn how to create the life you want and deserve.)- Which is also currently a big hit.</p>

Live Light stands for Living Light and being ""Free"" of gluten ,dairy and soy while also being vegetarian and eating clean, healthy, light foods. I have already started by altering and creating recipes to suit this lifestyle. 
My current cookbook/ebook/Kindle book ""Simply Gluten Dairy Free Baking: Plus, How to eliminate both from your diet in 3 easy steps."" has been a complete hit (as well as the soy free edition) and I am looking to expand on it and create a cookbook featuring recipes that qualify under all categories: Appetizers, Snacks, Entrees, Desserts and Non-Alcoholic Beverages. (Not just desserts.)
Note: Not only will they be free of gluten, dairy, soy and meat- they will also be healthy, nutritious and good for you too. There will also be low sugar, low sodium options, and all will be preferably low glycemic. Some will even be free of nuts and/or eggs. And the book will feature a guide on how to eliminate them from your diet, similar to the one in my baking cookbook.
There will also be a full healthy living lifestyle guide.
My philosophy is that you should never be deprived of the foods you love, simply because you have an allergy, sensitivity or specified or preferred way of life. You should be able to enjoy everything you love. And you should be able to eat healthy, light foods that are good for your body, mind & soul.
The funding will allow me to:
1. Cover the costs of ingredients to create these recipes (they are very expensive, because GF/DF/SF food is significantly more expensive than there conventional counterparts)
If each recipe costs me roughly $20 to make (and it only takes me one time to make it successfully) then I will need a minimum of over $6,000. Keep in mind it took me 8 loaves of bread before I made the successful loaf. It cost me roughly $80+ to make the bread recipe.
2. Cover the cost of the time it will take me to make this- over the next year. (Probably less than 1 year)
3. Allow me the ability to hire someone to edit, proof read and also create cover art for the cookbook. - As a photographer, I do all of the photography for the cookbook, which saves costs.
 4. It will also cover the costs of self-publishing to get you your copies of the book. And it will cover the cost of getting the book successfully published by a publisher.
5. It will also help me turn all of this Gluten Dairy Free Vegetarian goodness into a website featuring many of these delicious recipes and more. (Something else I might have to hire someone for.)
Why did I choose flexible funding?
I chose flexible funding so I can use the funds that come in to make recipes and even if I don't meet my goal, I will still be able to use the funds donated to create as much as I can with what I raised. Plus, I will still be able to send you the copies of your books that you get.
How many recipes am I hoping to make?
Good question! My goal is 300 or more- (that is why it is going to take so long.) But I know I will finish it because I already completed 2 books already and one of them is the cookbook I mentioned above. The other is a book called ""The Little Book of Manifesting"" (Learn how to create the life you want and deserve.)- Which is also currently a big hit.

<p>My name is Daniela Anderson. I spent 4 months at the Naini Leprosy Hospital in India, volunteering and learning about infectious disease as part of a Watson fellowship. I blogged throughout about my experience there, see: <a href=""http://tracingleprosy.wordpress.com/2012/12/30/sumit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tracingleprosy.wordpress.com/2012/12/30/sumit/</a></p>

In the 4 months I spent with Sumit in the hospital, he became one of the most important people in the world to me. He was discharged shortly before I left India. Sadly his disease has now relapsed and he was recently readmitted. He could not stay for the course of his treatment because he can’t pay the medical bills, so he returned to his village.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;"">It is critical that he gets the medical attention he needs. I am asking for your support to help meet Sumit's needed care. His daily hospital costs are only about 500 rupees ($10) a day, and he stays one month at a time, about 6X a year. We are targeting $3,500 US, since this should cover him for the next several years. Of course, more money will ensure care for even more years! If you would like to help Sumit, please donate now so we can reach our target. Every donation no matter how big or small will help us reach Sumit in an enduring way.</p>

<h3>Let's fund research that could cure millions of chronic pain, disability and diseases of aging</h3>
<p>Many people believe stem cell therapy has great promise, but will not be available for 15 or 20 years. The reality is that adult stem cell therapy has already been utilized in a number of countries and in FDA trials with some success as a treatment for heart failure, multiple sclerosis, spinal injury, <span>arthritis,</span> joint problems and other conditions. <span><span><span>Unfortunately</span></span></span><span> the current treatment does not work for everyone and sometimes only to a small degree. Much of the difficulty is that each of us only has a limited number of stem cells that can be used and the greater their age the less effective they are.</span> At Centagen we have a new approach to expand your own stem cells up to a million times without aging. We believe this will greatly increase the success rate as well as improve results for those who have received only minimal benefits. This might even be a real beginning at reversing the aging process since it supplies the body with a large number of ones own rejuvenated stem cells to rebuild organs and tissues that have been damaged by aging, injury or disease. Even better this type of adult stem cell therapy could be available fairly soon.</p>

<p>We see no upper limits to wellness at any age, and critical technologies are related to adult stem cells.  We see these as some of the quicker paths to continually improving our bodies and minds.  While embryonic stem cells have attracted most of the investment funding, adult stem cell research can give faster and safer results and does not raise ethical issues. Adult stem cell therapies have the potential to cure many age related conditions and rejuvenate our bodies.</p>
<p>Won’t you be part of this pioneering effort that could dramatically extend the youthful portions of our lives and the lives of our families?  Supporting these technologies now could keep our generation from being left behind in this race for cures. Our Research Fund provides financing for adult stem cell research and development projects. These critical technologies have a hard time attracting investment dollars because they will most likely not show short-term profits.</p>

Along with our clinical therapeutics, we are developing additional supplements that promote our own stem cells and have a positive benefit on other mechanisms of aging. Stem Cell 100 does not contain any stem cells. It is made with pharmaceutical grade plant extracts that have been used for thousands of years.</p>
<p>SIGNALS was formulated to send your skin the same rejuvenating ""signals"" as young adult stem cells to lessen the effects of aging on your skin. Laboratory tests prove ongoing users look 10, 15, even 20 years younger. The 3-step Skin Care System includes Signals Exfoliant, Signals Day Lotion and Signals Night Cream.

This will help repair and rejuvenate organs and tissues damaged by aging, disease and injury.</p>
<p>Each of us has a limited supply of the kind of stem cells needed to rebuild, repair, and rejuvenate any part of our body. As we age, the supply of these cells become smaller while their healing power diminishes. By providing a practically unlimited supply of one's own rejuvenated stem cells, we believe it will be possible to keep people young and healthy for over a century. There is also great hope for those with various health conditions related to aging, disease or injury to recover and live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>Adult stem cells can be extracted from your blood, fat, or skin and then multiplied a million fold in rejuvenating tissue culture.  Our <em>technology</em> <em>requires no genetic engineering</em> of the stem cells, so the procedure is much safer than the current procedures requiring genetic tampering. Only your own adult stem cells would be used, so there are <em>no ethical issues common with embryonic stem cell use</em> or side effects due to tissue rejection by your immune system.</p>
<p>Everyone has adult stem cells that are capable of repairing nearly all tissues in the body. Unfortunately, these adult stem cells typically decline in number or function as we age and can be depleted by injuries or illnesses. The current use of adult stem cells is limited by the small number of such cells in the body and by the current difficulty of amplifying fully functional adult stem cells in cell culture.  Using our proprietary technology, we can multiply the rare adult stem cells in cell culture without aging them or degrading their function.  One innovation involves lengthening the telomeres while amplifying the stem cells.</p>
<p>It is difficult to obtain normal funding for this kind of research, as the current stem cell research is focused on embryonic stem (ES) cells or genetically induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) cells.  The potential of ES and iPS cells are very exciting, but that potential is many years away from yielding safe and affordable treatments of diseases and medical conditions.  Research indicates that many of the same remarkable healing benefits can be achieved sooner and cheaper by safely utilizing your own adult stem cells. </p>

<p>After sufficient research and clinical work on the safety and effectiveness of rejuvenated adult stem cells is obtained, the stem cells can be utilized by hospitals and clinics for a wide range of age-related disorders and medical conditions.  Adult stem cells have the potential to save billions of dollars by curing or greatly improving age related conditions that are now treated as chronic disorders needing continuous medical intervention.</p></div>","STEM CELL 100 IS STILL AVAILABLE AND CAN BE PURCHASED AT www.StemCell100.com

 
Let's fund research that could cure millions of chronic pain, disability and diseases of aging
Many people believe stem cell therapy has great promise, but will not be available for 15 or 20 years. The reality is that adult stem cell therapy has already been utilized in a number of countries and in FDA trials with some success as a treatment for heart failure, multiple sclerosis, spinal injury, arthritis, joint problems and other conditions. Unfortunately the current treatment does not work for everyone and sometimes only to a small degree. Much of the difficulty is that each of us only has a limited number of stem cells that can be used and the greater their age the less effective they are. At Centagen we have a new approach to expand your own stem cells up to a million times without aging. We believe this will greatly increase the success rate as well as improve results for those who have received only minimal benefits. This might even be a real beginning at reversing the aging process since it supplies the body with a large number of ones own rejuvenated stem cells to rebuild organs and tissues that have been damaged by aging, injury or disease. Even better this type of adult stem cell therapy could be available fairly soon.
Maximum Life Foundation

Since 1999, Maximum Life Foundation has been dedicated to eradicating aging-related diseases, and the aging process itself.
As we age, we see every reason to be completely independent, energetic and youthful with MORE time with family and friends and MORE time to achieve each of our goals and dreams.  Our mission is to make “100 years old the New 50.”
We see no upper limits to wellness at any age, and critical technologies are related to adult stem cells.  We see these as some of the quicker paths to continually improving our bodies and minds.  While embryonic stem cells have attracted most of the investment funding, adult stem cell research can give faster and safer results and does not raise ethical issues. Adult stem cell therapies have the potential to cure many age related conditions and rejuvenate our bodies.
Won’t you be part of this pioneering effort that could dramatically extend the youthful portions of our lives and the lives of our families?  Supporting these technologies now could keep our generation from being left behind in this race for cures. Our Research Fund provides financing for adult stem cell research and development projects. These critical technologies have a hard time attracting investment dollars because they will most likely not show short-term profits.
Some of the benefits of adult stem cell therapy are available now
Although the focus of Centagen is clinical therapeutics with amplified stem cells, we applied some of  our technology to create an effective nutraceutical supplement that promotes adult stem cells.  Stem Cell 100TM combines ten pharmaceutical-grade natural vegetarian extracts that promote regenerative stem cells in the body.  Stem Cell 100TM acts by stimulating biological processes needed to promote healthy stem cells, while inhibiting the degenerative inflammatory reactions that limit stem cell function. Along with our clinical therapeutics, we are developing additional supplements that promote our own stem cells and have a positive benefit on other mechanisms of aging. Stem Cell 100 does not contain any stem cells. It is made with pharmaceutical grade plant extracts that have been used for thousands of years.
SIGNALS was formulated to send your skin the same rejuvenating ""signals"" as young adult stem cells to lessen the effects of aging on your skin. Laboratory tests prove ongoing users look 10, 15, even 20 years younger. The 3-step Skin Care System includes Signals Exfoliant, Signals Day Lotion and Signals Night Cream. From a former Miss America to successful business leaders of today, people around the world are benefiting from the breakthrough stem cell technology of SIGNALS. It does not contain stem cells.
