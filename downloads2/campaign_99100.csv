<h3>PinGo Summary</h3>

<ul><li><p>Can you imagine a bigger contribution than helping parents know that their kids are safe?  Or to maintain a family united?</p></li></ul>

<p>We need to start with $100K US dollars to achieve the first goal, which is to finish the app, to manufacture the device, and packaging. If we exceed that goal, we can promote it, create a website, redesign the device for the next version, and improve some useful accessories (already in the pipeline).</p>
<p>You might have heard about similar devices, but ours is unique for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Global coverage</strong>:  We will look to have coverage in more than 180 countries.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simple two-way communication</strong>: Your kids or older love ones won't need a mobile phone to be able to talk to you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Constant monitoring</strong>: You can know the route of the device in real time (this is very important in emergency cases) and listen to what is around it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A unique App</strong>: Specially designed App to make tracking simple and helpful.</p></li>

<p>If we don't reach the entire goal here, we will look to find new ways to make this happen because we know we can help families with this solution.</p>
<p>The funds collected will be used to accelerate our project and help us provide a better solution and service.</p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","PinGo Summary
Having the peace of mind of knowing where the people or things you love are in real time, and knowing they are safe, is priceless.

We are PinGo Entrepreneurs and we have over 15 years experience in the consumer industry, looking at potential products of interest and developing winning concepts for the Mexican and Latin American population.
PinGo will improve our lives by helping us know where our loved ones are in real time.


PinGo integrates a children/pet/elderly - friendly device with a great app to help us to locate them at any time, giving our loved ones incremental space and freedom.

Our solution will give us peace of mind by giving us an accurate location and the possibility to communicate with our loved ones through the built-in two way communication system.

Can you imagine a bigger contribution than helping parents know that their kids are safe?  Or to maintain a family united?
Your contribution will help us to finish the app, improve the device (and possible redesign) and to start changing lives.

What We Need & What You Get

We need to start with $100K US dollars to achieve the first goal, which is to finish the app, to manufacture the device, and packaging. If we exceed that goal, we can promote it, create a website, redesign the device for the next version, and improve some useful accessories (already in the pipeline).
You might have heard about similar devices, but ours is unique for the following reasons:

Global coverage:  We will look to have coverage in more than 180 countries.
Simple two-way communication: Your kids or older love ones won't need a mobile phone to be able to talk to you.
Constant monitoring: You can know the route of the device in real time (this is very important in emergency cases) and listen to what is around it.
A unique App: Specially designed App to make tracking simple and helpful.


If we don't reach the entire goal here, we will look to find new ways to make this happen because we know we can help families with this solution.
The funds collected will be used to accelerate our project and help us provide a better solution and service.

The Impact
The device can be on any object that you want to track like bikes, cars, suitcases, drones, etc., but especially it's focused on children, elders and pets.

In pets, this is a good alternative to the chips used under the skin. More pets can be tracked.
Missing people problem
In many countries, missing children are not tracked.  It is estimated that at least 8 million children worldwide go missing each year.
A very large number of children will be reported missing each year:

When a child goes missing, the first 3 hours are the most crucial in finding the child safely. In some countries, it can take over 2 hours to get information about a missing child from a panicked parent.
Family abductions are the most common type of child abduction.
Additionally, people go missing for other reasons. For example, those who suffer from mental disorders and go missing often receive little attention.
In most jurisdictions, missing person cases receive low priority.
Those with drug and alcohol addiction, psychiatric problems, and the elderly suffering from dementia or Alzheimer’s make up the bulk of missing-adult cases. 

Risks & Challenges

Similar devices might be found but a few or maybe none with as integral a solution as ours.
To be compared with competitors that don’t consider family needs, in real situations and emergencies.
We need to have a dedicated team to improve the device and App features, 24-hour support to ensure the App is working correctly and key partnerships to generate an integral solution.
PinGo depends on the satellite coverage similar to a smart phone. The results are directly related to the signal in the zone.
We know we have to constantly improve our integral solutions. We really believe in this first version. We know there is a problem in several countries and we have been working for years on an integral solution. As a parent, I'm convinced that I would use it.
We might not be the first ones but we strive to be the best ones.

</div><p>We strongly believe that more people on bikes in our cities make for healthier and happier societies. The MIRA bags take one of the excuses out - imagine no more struggling with the following:</p><ul>
<li><p>taking your laptop to the office while commuting by bike. No more heavy bags on your shoulders. Let your bike carry your computer for you.</p></li>
<li><p>carrying your daily necessities on your back (goodbye backpacks, goodbye sweaty back on a summer morning!) or attached to your cycle with plastic bags, straps and other creative yet uncomfortable way. MIRA holds it all, in style.</p></li>
<li><p>carrying your water-resistant sporty pannier to the office. As many others you might have used your touring panniers for commuting purposes. It doesn't really go with your suit, we guess, nor is it handy to carry when you're off the bike. MIRA bag sorts this out for you, acting as both - office bag and bicycle pannier.</p></li>
<li><p>trying to squeeze your favourite handbag into a touring pannier. Errr. just stop it or you'll damage both. We believe that the Au Lait, the Swing Velvet or the Elston will become your new favourite handbag as it's become ours. AND it will clip on your bicycle in no time. You're welcome! :)</p></li>

We have gone through a number of meetings and sample makings with many manufacturers to be sure that the factory supplying our bags is reliable and trustworthy. After testing the final batch of samples earlier this year we are ready to have the production started. We are very excited about these designs and just can't wait to see our bags on your bikes around the world.</p><p>We need to raise £10,000 to complete the <b>production of the initial 3 styles</b> that will start the MIRA bag line. The costs will include the purchase of materials, workmanship, packaging, express shipping costs, customs and all legal charges that will apply. To keep the final prices reasonable (and this is what we are aiming for) we are required to place an order for a large number of bags so the manpower and materials used per piece are on an optimal level. We would also like to use expedited shipping so you could still enjoy your new bags this bike season and so your reward would be delivered to you as quickly as it is physically possible. </p><p>If we do not manage to raise the funds necessary, we will need to delay the production until we can save enough to have it running or we will need to increase the price of the bags due to making an order that does not match a Minimum Order Quantity for our factory. None of these is a perfect plan so we are counting on you!</p><p><b>We made these bags for you</b> - all urban cyclists out there - and we hope you will like them as much as we do. If so, <b>please support our project and help our bags get on your bikes!</b></p><div><br/></div><div>

Hi, we are Gosia and Maciek. We live by bicycle.
             
We both love cycling and we bike everywhere - any season, any weather (well, count the storms out!). We cycle to work, we do our shopping, work errands and all sorts of other activities by bike. Gosia even carried out a social/photography project aimed to show everyone that all year cycling is easy and doable - it was called “365 Days with a Bike”, covered 69 bicycles, 12 countries and, well, 365 days, the whole of 2013.In 2011 we decided to combine our passion with work and started our own company - Bike Belle, a boutique for cycle enthusiasts with a carefully selected collection of bicycle accessories to make your cycling easier, prettier and more you. Bike Belle stocks a range of bike baskets made of sustainably sourced wicker, colourful bicycle bells, waterproof seat covers, coffee holders, skirt guards and much, much more. Bike Belle branded items are designed by us and our team and made with great care and as such are now available from our website and from our stockists in over 12 countries worldwide with more international partners coming onboard very soon.                      MIRA is our perfect everyday cycling bag We know about bicycle accessories. Whatever we introduce in our boutique, we have tested ourselves. But there was still something missing for us: a pannier bag that could be elegant enough to be used as a business bag or a smart handbag. We both tester numerous panniers and and found nothing that would fully match our needs. 
So, as many times before, we went to design the perfect product ourselves. We called it MIRA, Spanish for ""look!"" as the bags draw immediate attention. The name is also the first letters of our surnames to emphasize how close we are to our own designs.We made it big enough to hold a regular 15'’ laptop ,we gave it a handle for comfortable carrying and a shoulder strap to make it more versatile. We attached an easy to use clip-on system to the back of each bag so it can be quickly taken on or off a bike. 


See how it works:


MIRA bags can help changing the world - one bike at a time. 
We strongly believe that more people on bikes in our cities make for healthier and happier societies. The MIRA bags take one of the excuses out - imagine no more struggling with the following:
taking your laptop to the office while commuting by bike. No more heavy bags on your shoulders. Let your bike carry your computer for you.
carrying your daily necessities on your back (goodbye backpacks, goodbye sweaty back on a summer morning!) or attached to your cycle with plastic bags, straps and other creative yet uncomfortable way. MIRA holds it all, in style.
carrying your water-resistant sporty pannier to the office. As many others you might have used your touring panniers for commuting purposes. It doesn't really go with your suit, we guess, nor is it handy to carry when you're off the bike. MIRA bag sorts this out for you, acting as both - office bag and bicycle pannier.
trying to squeeze your favourite handbag into a touring pannier. Errr. just stop it or you'll damage both. We believe that the Au Lait, the Swing Velvet or the Elston will become your new favourite handbag as it's become ours. AND it will clip on your bicycle in no time. You're welcome! :)
The MIRA bags provide the combination of style and functionality we have been looking for.  We hope the campaign will also raise awareness and show people that there does not need to be a compromise between your transport choice and style. Now we need your support to bring this idea to life.You can help make it happen!It took us over a year and a half to develop these bags. We have gone through a number of meetings and sample makings with many manufacturers to be sure that the factory supplying our bags is reliable and trustworthy. After testing the final batch of samples earlier this year we are ready to have the production started. We are very excited about these designs and just can't wait to see our bags on your bikes around the world.We need to raise £10,000 to complete the production of the initial 3 styles that will start the MIRA bag line. The costs will include the purchase of materials, workmanship, packaging, express shipping costs, customs and all legal charges that will apply. To keep the final prices reasonable (and this is what we are aiming for) we are required to place an order for a large number of bags so the manpower and materials used per piece are on an optimal level. We would also like to use expedited shipping so you could still enjoy your new bags this bike season and so your reward would be delivered to you as quickly as it is physically possible. If we do not manage to raise the funds necessary, we will need to delay the production until we can save enough to have it running or we will need to increase the price of the bags due to making an order that does not match a Minimum Order Quantity for our factory. None of these is a perfect plan so we are counting on you!We made these bags for you - all urban cyclists out there - and we hope you will like them as much as we do. If so, please support our project and help our bags get on your bikes!

<p>As it plays out, my AmeriCorps commitments end in November, and a HUGE opportunity has been offered to me, to spend 12 days in Nepal, rebuilding a village that was decimated by the second 7.2 Magnitude Earthquake that effected the area. I can't even put into words how thrilled I am to have this opportunity to change lives in Nepal! </p>
<p>Our work in Nepal will be to rebuild the local school, as well as local homes that were destroyed in the quake. We will work along side the local community to build their economy, livelihood and educational infrastructure. The trip will be hard- lots of hard labor, tent sleeping, 24 hours of travel one way... whew! What a crazy adventure! The trip itself is from <b>November 28th-December 9th</b>.</p>
<p>In order to make this Trip a reality, I have several hurdles to clear. </p>
<p><b>First</b>, I need to raise $500 to secure my spot on the team. This is an urgent need, as there are only 12 spots on each team, and over 60 people were asked to consider the trip! </p>
<p><b>Second</b>, I need an additional 1300 to cover my costs while in-country. According to the company that is hosting our team, this will cover our transportation, food, lodging and etc while in Nepal. <i>The $1800 I am hoping to raise in the first 60 days is to cover both the first and second hurdles! </i></p>
<p><b>Third</b>, I need around $1800 to cover the cost of my flight, round trip. </p>
<p><b>And Finally</b>, I'd like to have extra spending money to boost the economy in the area. The leadership has already mentioned that donations on-the-ground, and investments into projects are a possibility while we are there. I would love to have the chance to make some on-the-spot donations to the local community- whether that means buying homemade items, gifting funds, or purchasing tools to leave behind for the locals to utilize... I want to be able to go above and beyond to make a lasting impact in this village! </p>
<p><i><b>If I don't raise the money that I need to take the trip, I will donate the funds to someone else who IS going on the trip, or directly to Sherpa Karma, who owns the company that is sending volunteers, and is a member of the affected village. </b></i></p>
<p>I can't wait to take this amazing, epic adventure.

Siempre había soñado vivir como mis personajes favoritos, al estilo de indiana jones; entre la selva africana como Jane Goodall o caminar hacia la naturaleza salvaje con no más que una mochila como lo hizo Christopher McCandless. A mi manera, estoy viviendo y haciéndole honor a esos sueños de niña, montada en una bicicleta por el mundo, viviendo mi propia aventura de la vida.  WHO AM I? Daniella, 27 years old, dreamer, social communicator and journalist, cycle traveler, chronicle writer, focusing on body arts and movement. I was born in the central mountain range of the Andes of Colombia. I have always dreamed of living as my favorite characters, in the style of Indiana Jones; among the African jungle like Jane Goodall; or walking into the wild with no more than a backpack like Christopher McCandless did. In my own way, I'm living and honoring those girlish dreams, riding a bike around the world, and living my own life adventure. QUÉ ES? Ngongorokó tiene dos ejes principales: 1. Los talleres de expresión corporal: en donde se generan espacios de intercambio de saberes que ponen en tensión acciones y pensamientos en torno al cuerpo, tales como las prácticas estéticas base en el camino del autoconocimiento y aceptación de sí mismos para el amor propio. 2. La Escritura: se recolectan y documentan historias transformadoras desde la misma experiencia de amarse a sí mismos.  WHAT IS IT? Ngongorokó has two main axes: 1. Body expression workshops: where there are spaces for the exchange of knowledge that strains actions and thoughts around the body, such as aesthetic practices based on the path of self-knowledge and acceptance of oneself for self-love. 2. Writing: transformative stories are collected and documented from the experience of loving yourself.  POR QUÉ ES IMPORTANTE?Tenía preparada una super respuesta a esta pregunta, pero quiero decir unas cosas, un tanto más espontáneas: La verdad es que he estado creando este proyecto desde inicios del 2019, pero sólo hasta inicios del 2020, empecé a materializarlo por esta plataforma.Me dije a mi misma, que debía atreverme a hacer lo que mi corazón dictara, aunque tuviera miedo, aunque me diera vergüenza exponerme tanto. Y aunque no fue el coronavirus lo que generó este pensamiento, si fue el momento de la crisis, el que me permitió entender la importancia de los proyectos que nos devuelven imágenes de nosotros mismos. Por ejemplo, un individuo que nunca se ha visto reflejado frente al espejo, es un individuo que no se reconoce ni acepta con facilidad, un individuo por ende, con tremendos problemas para reconocer al otro. La importancia de este abordaje se remite precisamente al fenómeno de la expresión, la comunicación como aquello que se pone en común y es de significativo para la misma comprensión de la vida. Es necesario restituir la experiencia del otro y transformarla. Lo que se propone es vivir el cuerpo con espontaneidad, entendiendo la experiencia que se manifiesta en la cotidianidad. Haz parte del proyecto y ayúdame a dar mucho ngongorokó pu vó (amor pa’vos)  WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? I had prepared a super answer to this question, but I want to say a few things that are somewhat more spontaneous. The truth is that I have been creating this project since the beginning of 2019, but only after the beginning of 2020, I started to materialize it through this platform.I told myself that I should dare to do what my heart dictated, even if I was afraid.

<p><strong>The perfect gear when you need to cutaway </strong></p>
<p>Tired of bringing too much or not enough everytime you go outdoors? LINK is a versatile blanket with everything you need to relax outside, all in one tiny package! If there are trees, it’s a hammock, on windier days you can snap it around you. If there’s a field or you are back home in the sofa, it’s a cozy blanket. If you’re traveling, it’s a pillow or travelsheet. Perfect for backpacking, vanlife, festivals, home comfort, or just a day outside.</p>

<p><strong>These features can be combined to convert the blanket to what's needed for the situation. </strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the built-in ropes, it's possible to transition the blanket into a hammock or travelsheet in a few seconds. The ropes also works as weights to hold the blanket steadier on the ground. With the buttons you can snap it around you like a hammock cocoon, travelsheet or as a poncho. You can also turn it to a XL blanket by connecting two links. With the two-sized bag, you can pack it either small or big depending on what's needed for the situation. </p>

</div></div>","The perfect gear when you need to cutaway 
Tired of bringing too much or not enough everytime you go outdoors? LINK is a versatile blanket with everything you need to relax outside, all in one tiny package! If there are trees, it’s a hammock, on windier days you can snap it around you. If there’s a field or you are back home in the sofa, it’s a cozy blanket. If you’re traveling, it’s a pillow or travelsheet. Perfect for backpacking, vanlife, festivals, home comfort, or just a day outside.
 

 



 

These features can be combined to convert the blanket to what's needed for the situation. 
Thanks to the built-in ropes, it's possible to transition the blanket into a hammock or travelsheet in a few seconds. The ropes also works as weights to hold the blanket steadier on the ground. With the buttons you can snap it around you like a hammock cocoon, travelsheet or as a poncho. You can also turn it to a XL blanket by connecting two links. With the two-sized bag, you can pack it either small or big depending on what's needed for the situation. 
 
 

 
Progress and development
Since we launched our first campaign, we've recieved a lot of awesome feedback from you and from our live testing on festivals.  We've improved the new generation of LINK by adding smarter solutions to make it even more useful in your everyday life. 

 

If you're purchasing our products outside of EU, there might be added customs in your country. Custom fees are not included in the shipping. To see what you might have to pay your gouvernment - use this shipping calculator:

(See her paintings here: <a href=""http://katalinpazmandi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://katalinpazmandi.com</a>) We are both musicians as well. We own the land and live on it full time with our son Bo, who is 13 at the moment. We also have a dog: Coconut and a cat named Cicoka. We have 6 chickens and two ducks as well. </p>
<p>We sold our small house in order to purchase the land on August, 2020, with big dreams in our hearts.   But now we need help to make it possible!</p>

<p><b>The land:</b></p>
<p>The land is located on Mountaindale Rd in Greenfield Park, NY. It is an Upstate New York location that is very close to major hiking areas, many spiritual communities, state forests, and many fun small towns in the area. The land is 13.9 acres with forests, meadow, wetland and rocky outcrops in some parts. It has a tiny stream and a spring on it.  In order to develop the land as a campground, as a prerequisite we would need to put in a septic system and a well, and build a foundation for a tiny home that will be about 400 sq feet.</p>
<p>We will use it as a full time residence.</p>

<p>Our Forest Goddess Guardian. (Katalin Pazmandi: Forest Goddess (2020) katalinpazmandi.com)</p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div></div>","Yeti Research Healing Outpost Biodynamic Nature Preserve & Campground
 
A spiritual and biodynamic campground and event space offering traditions of natural living & bushcrafting, olde world gardening, healing, music, spirit work and higher self development.

Our principals:
Our principals are caring for and evolving the natural landscapes and forests, according to biodynamic, old world traditional skills and gardening, & forest caretaking. 
 
The idea: 
Our main idea is to facilitate and maintain sacred events and provide natural building structures  (indoor and outdoor) for spiritual gatherings, performances and educational workshops. This will include traditional craft making, bush crafting, off grid living, healing the soil & healing ourselves, permaculture, traditions of natural healing, wild foods & plant medicines, spiritual development, and sacred musical events.  These events will be small scale, up to max 200 people. 

About us:
Brian Gardner & Katalin Pazmandi.
Brian is a long time herbalist, natural healer, and Katalin is a visionary artist, gardener. (See her paintings here: http://katalinpazmandi.com) We are both musicians as well. We own the land and live on it full time with our son Bo, who is 13 at the moment. We also have a dog: Coconut and a cat named Cicoka. We have 6 chickens and two ducks as well. 
We sold our small house in order to purchase the land on August, 2020, with big dreams in our hearts.   But now we need help to make it possible!

The land:
The land is located on Mountaindale Rd in Greenfield Park, NY. It is an Upstate New York location that is very close to major hiking areas, many spiritual communities, state forests, and many fun small towns in the area. The land is 13.9 acres with forests, meadow, wetland and rocky outcrops in some parts. It has a tiny stream and a spring on it.  In order to develop the land as a campground, as a prerequisite we would need to put in a septic system and a well, and build a foundation for a tiny home that will be about 400 sq feet.
We will use it as a full time residence.

Event plans:
1.  Forest Art & Shamanic Practices school to learn natural art making techniques, spring and fall workshops for ages 10 to 18.

<br/><h3><b>What is Solbrite</b></h3>Solbrite is a solar fairy light that now has a detachable solar
panel.  Never seen before! It was created
in 2015 out of a personal need.  We have too much shade in our front patio
therefore the normal solar panel was not getting charged by the sun in able for
it to work.  Problem solved. Easy to detach – simply place in the sun
during the day, reattach at night and see the magic of these lights shine!  <u>They work in ALL shady areas and in your
home! </u>These lights are no longer
limited to being placed in direct sun. 
The uses are endless. Your contribution
will help people all over the world who love the ambiance of solar fairy lights, use
them anywhere – inside, outside, shady spots or sunny spots!

<p>It
is hard to comprehend what this means when it’s represented simply as data. It
should be as modest as: there’s a kid in need, let’s lend a hand! So that’s
what it comes down to. There are children in Portugal that could use your

places, but this is just another small stepping stone to support the sweet,

<h2><u>FAQs</u></h2>
<p><b>1. Why Portugal?</b> Unfortunately, there is not a shortage of
kids in need. My boyfriend and I currently reside in Portugal and it was the
best place for us to start. Hopefully we find ourselves capable of doing this
in many other countries across the world. <br/>
<br/><b>
2. How did this idea come about?</b> My boyfriend has spent many summer weeks
volunteering at a summer camp (CFT) for underprivileged children. Last summer
(2014), the summer camp bid their farewell and closed down due to lack of
government funding. Bruno will forever be heartbroken over the loss of this
camp as it was not only a humbling learning experience for him, but also a
wonderful escape for all the kids that don’t have the same opportunities as
their peers. It would require substantial budgeting changes from the government
or a large outside investor to get the camp going again. In comparison, this
project seems little but is my tribute to my boyfriend, to those kids, to those
volunteers, and to that camp. Also, it’s a 25<sup>th</sup> birthday present to
myself. </p>
<p><b>3. What age group will these backpacks be for?</b> 18.2% of kids
in social institution care facilities are 6 - 12 years old. These are kids who

Introducing the Mega Awesome All-in-1 (did
we say awesome?) Pen! This pen will take you to whole new levels,
get you doing things you never thought were possible! Check it out for
yourself! 

About this projectWhen
you support our project, you help to fill up some cool backpacks with essential
school supplies for an underprivileged kid in Portugal! Every
child is entitled to an education and we should strive to make sure that every
one of those children is as prepared for school as possible. Our mission is to
fill as many backpacks as possible with essentials for the school year (all
items that will be placed in backpacks can be found below!).  
It
is hard to comprehend what this means when it’s represented simply as data. It
should be as modest as: there’s a kid in need, let’s lend a hand! So that’s
what it comes down to. There are children in Portugal that could use your
helping hand, as there are unfortunately many other children in many other
places, but this is just another small stepping stone to support the sweet,
tiny, smiling faces of our world.  


Here's what's in each backpack!
• Backpack • 3 x Notebooks• Loose-leaf Paper• Pencil Sharpener• Pack of Highlighters• Pack of Pencils• Pair of Scissors• Pack of Erasers• Pack of Markers• Pack of Colored Pencils• Shatterproof Ruler• Pack of Glue Sticks• Pencil Pouch• Pocket Folder• Basic Calculator• Pack of Crayons• Pen Corrector• Binder• Hand Sanitizer• Copy of “The Little Prince”• Some Mega Awesome 50-in-1 Pens!
     (this list is subject to change as we meet more goals)


We are budgeting €50 per backpack just
in case of sold out items or prices going up after the ""start of the
school year sales"". However, all money will be utilized in buying supplies
for the kids. We are seeking potential sponsors of supplies that may decrease
some of these prices, in which case we'll be able to get even more
backpacks! 
Our
goal of €5,000 is set with the aim to supply 100 kids with packed
backpacks! 
TL;DR:You back us, get some Mega
Awesome All-in-1 Pens, and help buy school supplies for a kid in need. It's
a win, win! 
FAQs
1. Why Portugal? Unfortunately, there is not a shortage of
kids in need. My boyfriend and I currently reside in Portugal and it was the
best place for us to start. Hopefully we find ourselves capable of doing this
in many other countries across the world. 

2. How did this idea come about? My boyfriend has spent many summer weeks
volunteering at a summer camp (CFT) for underprivileged children. Last summer
(2014), the summer camp bid their farewell and closed down due to lack of
government funding. Bruno will forever be heartbroken over the loss of this
camp as it was not only a humbling learning experience for him, but also a
wonderful escape for all the kids that don’t have the same opportunities as
their peers. It would require substantial budgeting changes from the government
or a large outside investor to get the camp going again. In comparison, this
project seems little but is my tribute to my boyfriend, to those kids, to those
volunteers, and to that camp. Also, it’s a 25th birthday present to
myself. 
3. What age group will these backpacks be for? 18.2% of kids
in social institution care facilities are 6 - 12 years old. These are kids who
should be beaming with excitement for the new school year, much like many of us
were when we went shopping for new school supplies with our parents. However,
many of these institutions can barely keep up with providing the basics and
often rely on donations. 
4. How will we distribute the backpacks? Our plan is to
purchase and pack the backpacks. Then distribute to the various institutions
across the country (concentrating on smaller ones that don’t get as much
support as others). The actual number of different institutions we get to vary
on the amount of funds we raise. We will keep this page updated as we
distribute the backpacks! 
5. Are the pens really that awesome? Pretty much. Each purchased
pen puts a smile on our faces and hopefully on a wee kid’s face too!Further InformationIf you'd like to help support underprivileged children in Portugal in other ways, check out this site: http://www.iacrianca.pt/index.php/en/institute/... Unfortunately, it does not provide the information in English but you can send an e-mail asking for further information. Of course, you can always go to: www.supportunicef.org/donate and donate to children in need all over the world!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, we're Mike and Graham. Mike is a blogger and YouTuber, and Graham helps to run a mail order business specialising in all kinds of weird and wonderful magical and new age goodies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every year we go away, experiencing pubs - we've done Hull, Leeds, countless little villages, but our favourite place is Robin Hood's Bay in North Yorkshire. We're going for 3 nights in November, taking in a stop at Whitby while we're there.  And we'd love  for you to get involved!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're putting the trip up for sponsoring, from a third of a pint, right up to headline sponsors.  You can be a sponsor of the trip, getting your name the sponsor t-shirts that we'll be wearing, and you'll be featured on Mike's blog and video channel too!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's just a bit of fun of course - but what's wrong with helping to create a bit of fun? :)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for £500 (in an ideal world) to pay for the trip, transport costs, and spending money while we're there.  We're going in November when it's going to be cheaper, so we can keep costs down.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have tons of perks for you, and the great thing is that you can get involved from just £1!  Yes, you can sponsor a third of a pint of beer, and you'll get your name on the sponsor t-shirt just for that.  Amazing, but true.  By default what we'll have printed is your name will be from your Indiegogo account, but if possible we'll try to get in touch to ask if you have an alternative - but be aware that we'll be up against it time-wise to get the t-shirts printed so if we do email, expect to have to respond quickly if you want a custom name.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, if you want to sponsor a swift half, a pint (for either Graham or Mike - choose your favourite!), a round, or even a bed for the night, you can make that happen.  Check out the perks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't hit our target, that's fine, but every pound we do raise will go towards creating some great experiences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mike has done a successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign before, the Travelling Book Project, which enabled over twenty travelling journals to be sent around the world, visiting places such as the UK, Ohio, Las Vegas, Australia, and Germany.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>We do also have some stretch goals - if we hit £1000 we'll look at sending beer mats to certain levels, and beyond that we'll look at unlocking more stretch goals!!  If we get a silly amount of money we may well produce the sponsor t-shirt for some supporters also.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks - well, in life, there are always risks. Probably the biggest risk is that for you to get your name (or logo, if you're going for a big perk) onto the sponsor t-shirt we need those names in as soon as possible. We'll be using whatever name you use to support the project (and we do reserve the right to exclude any names which are a bit rude, sorry for that) but we'll need logos or special requests in asap to make them happen. Worst comes to worst - you'll be missed off the t-shirts. This will be a last resort, of course.</p>
<p>If we don't get anywhere near the target, we might have to rethink the t-shirts - the cost of printing 2 t-shirts for us isn't huge but is still a chunk of cash, so if we can't do it we may go for a low-budget option, like having your names stapled to a normal t-shirt.  No, I'm not looking forward to it either.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you think this is an awesome project but not for you, that's fine.  But don't forget that you can use the Indiegogo share tools to share the project with friends, that would be lovely too :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have enabled ""InDemand"" so that donations can be given after the campaign ends.  Any money which rolls in afterwards will go towards future trips :)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Stuff</strong></h3>
<p>We ought to say that being a sponsor doesn't mean that we recommend or endorse you or your organisation in any way (although we're very grateful to you for sponsoring us!!!)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those thinking about this as a business marketing proposition (haha), my blog - thoggy.blogspot.com - has had 25,000 views over its life, and according to Feedburner has currently over 40 subscribers. My YouTube channel - youtube.com/ravenswingthog - has 21,000 views and 99 subscribers. In the past I've been pleased to work with various brands and products such as Illumibowl, Little Party Parcels, Virtually Sorted, and Randomise.</p>

Probably the biggest risk is that for you to get your name (or logo, if you're going for a big perk) onto the sponsor t-shirt we need those names in as soon as possible. We'll be using whatever name you use to support the project (and we do reserve the right to exclude any names which are a bit rude, sorry for that) but we'll need logos or special requests in asap to make them happen. Worst comes to worst - you'll be missed off the t-shirts. This will be a last resort, of course.
If we don't get anywhere near the target, we might have to rethink the t-shirts - the cost of printing 2 t-shirts for us isn't huge but is still a chunk of cash, so if we can't do it we may go for a low-budget option, like having your names stapled to a normal t-shirt.  No, I'm not looking forward to it either.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you think this is an awesome project but not for you, that's fine.  But don't forget that you can use the Indiegogo share tools to share the project with friends, that would be lovely too :)
 
We have enabled ""InDemand"" so that donations can be given after the campaign ends.  Any money which rolls in afterwards will go towards future trips :)
 
Other Stuff
We ought to say that being a sponsor doesn't mean that we recommend or endorse you or your organisation in any way (although we're very grateful to you for sponsoring us!!!)
 
For those thinking about this as a business marketing proposition (haha), my blog - thoggy.blogspot.com - has had 25,000 views over its life, and according to Feedburner has currently over 40 subscribers. My YouTube channel - youtube.com/ravenswingthog - has 21,000 views and 99 subscribers.

<h3>Where to use?</h3>
<p>Everybody experienced it…. Dreamlike blue sky, you sit in the café, a beer garden, sports club or you are on tour in the nature, but unfortunately it is too cold to enjoy the atmosphere. This has happened too often to us! We now offer the solution. With the ButtHeater, freezing during chilling is a thing of the past. The smart designed heating wire net is arranged in such a way that heat from the seat cushion is radiated from the lower back region along the butt almost to the knee. The integrated heating blanket provides heat to the thighs, while at the same time ensuring that the heat remains on the body and is not released into the open air.<br/><br/>The Buttheater is therefore perfectly designed for outdoor activities or a visit to a restaurant in the open or under chilled rooms.</p>

here to tell you about a solution that will revolutionize the way we board and
deplane airplanes.  If you have traveled
on an airplane, then you know exactly what I am talking about.  The long wait you cannot avoid getting on and
off the airplane.  Every flight, every
airline and every zone has the same problem. 
You hurry to get in line only to find yourself waiting to get through
several segmented lines.  You have the
line to scan your ticket, then a line in the connector hallway, and then a line
when stepping on the plane and another to find your seat, and one more to place
your bag and get seated.  And this all
happens after you spent 40 minutes waiting for your zone to be called.</span></p>
<p>Often times we spend more time waiting than actually on our
flight.  This fact is exactly how I came
up with my solution.  A few years ago I
realized I was waiting longer than I was flying.  Then I started to research and I realized
that the airlines are only making money when airplanes are flying.  So the airlines want a solution just as badly
as the disgruntled flier.  And this was
the beginning of my journey.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Several months and over 2,100 hours of researching,
simulating, testing, and prototyping, later, Dynaerobridge, a jet way that
provides multiple access points to aircraft, has sparked the interest of
airports and was selected as first-place winner of Discovery Day, a research
competition hosted by the Office of Undergraduate Research at Embry-Riddle

<p>I want you to see the vision behind this venture, so I’ve explained more about it below. You’ll find out WHAT I am doing, WHEN I am doing it, WHO I am, WHY this campaign matters so much, and HOW you can help.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Last Spring I worked with Airline Optimization and
Simulation System experts to test the time savings capability of Dynaerobridge. We
tested Dynaerobridge in worse case scenarios to see the minimum amount of
boarding and deplaning time that could be saved if airlines adopted this
innovative jet bridge. Using our proprietary method, it takes on average, </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">7 to 9 minutes </b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> to board 137 passengers with carry-ons
through the front and rear door of a Boeing 737-700. This time savings is ground
breaking considering that it currently takes airlines 30-40 minutes to board
the same number of passengers. Similarly, using Dynaerobridge, deplaning 137
passengers only takes on average, </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">5 to 7
minutes</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.  Again, this is revolutionary!  </span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dynaerobridge is an add-on system that can be attached to existing jet bridges, allowing passengers to board or disembark an airplane through multiple access doors, simultaneously. Dynaerobridge offers airlines and airports worldwide a cost-effective solution to increase efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability.</p>

</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As you can see from the video, by removing the issue of that gridlock as everyone enters through the same door,  Dynaerobridge makes it easy for everyone to get on and off the plane fast and safe.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471056195/3_sgz8hb.png"" src="""" style=""width: 575.355px;height: 91px;""/></p>
</div><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Most air travelers have common story of misery about their experience during the boarding process through a single door.  But that is about to change. Dynaerobridge will allow passenger to exit the aircraft through the access door closer to their seat, removing the need to exit the aircraft through a single door, which is usually at the forward side of the aircraft. With Dynaerobridge, passengers with tight connecting flights can exit the aircraft in time to catch their next flight.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The usage of Dynaerobridge means that you would be able get to your gate 10 minutes before departure and still be able to catch your flight. It means less missed connecting flights, easy boarding for the handicapped, </span>elderly,<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> those traveling with infants, more time in the air and less waiting, happier customers, more revenue for airlines, lower ticket costs for those who like to fly with low cost carriers, and overall a more seamless flying experience for everyone: pilots, operators, flyers and flight attendants.  And this is what we have been looking for so long.  A solution that pleases every party while remaining safe, cost effective and enjoyable.</span></span></p><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The
purpose of this campaign is to raise  money to create further test the design and engineering features of Dynaerobridge. This will be </span>accomplished through  the development of a scaled model prototype. Once the design and engineering testings are complete,<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the next phase will be to enter into licensing agreement with companies who already manufacture jet ways.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The prices for jetways  can go anywhere between $350K to $4M   so in order to begin manufacturing Dynaerobridge myself, I will need at least $5M. Although I will be amazed and humbled if I could raise that amount here on Indiegogo,  at this </span>initial<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> stage, I am considering </span>licensing<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Dynaerobridge so it can get to airports as soon as possible. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">From my end, I have single handedly funded this project from design to getting a patent. That is because because I believe in the Dynaerobridge’s potential of making air travel less stressful for frequent air travelers. You too can contribute to see this dream come true!</span></p>

I took the risk up front by delaying the launch of this campaign until I believed it was ready, to lessen the risk to my backers. I have worked with industry experts to test the Dynaerobridge’s time savings, and the results are remarkable. There is little or no risk here. As explained earlier, Jet ways cost anywhere from $350K to $4M each so my intention is not to start production. Rather, my goal is to raise enough money to develop a demonstration prototype, which will be used to pitch to those who have the means to make the Dynaerobridge a reality such as airport and airlines.  I have the backing of a great team so I don't predict many obstacles here.  But there is always the unknown. I will face every obstacle with the same tenacity and perseverance that I have had from the start.</span></p>

<p>First off, yes my real name is Dynamite.  So you can imagine the pressure I feel with a name like that. (kidding) Dynamite originates from the Greek word – “Dunamis” which means power.  So my goal is to use my strength in problem solving, my devotion to learning and my passion for helping others, to make this come to life.</p>
<p>I was born in the war-torn part of northern Nigeria but I immigrated to the USA in 2010 to pursue my passion for aviation. Currently, I am an aerospace engineering senior at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Florida. I am concentrating in aeronautics with minors in aeronautical studies, aviation safety, and commercial space operations. I have worked on several aerospace projects including a Single Person Spacecraft (SPS), as well as a low –orbital, Satellite Imaging System.  I have  also played the role of chairperson for the design, construction and development of Eco-dolphin, a fleet of three Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, designed to monitor coastal environments and help researchers study underwater life. <br/></p>

<p>Because it will be unrealistic and of no use to ship a Dynaerobridge to each supporter, I had to come up with a smart and creative way to reward Dynaerobridge's fans for all their support and donations. I am very blessed to have the support of great artists from different parts of the world who have agreed to help me out with my perks. These artists see the potential in Dynaerobridge and its potential to change the way we board and exit airplanes that they all have gone  out of their ways to release the rights of their work at no additional cost. In order words, you are free to use the perk(s) you get through this campaign for anything you like because <b>you will not be infringing on, or violating the artist's copyrights. </b></p>

here to tell you about a solution that will revolutionize the way we board and
deplane airplanes.  If you have traveled
on an airplane, then you know exactly what I am talking about.  The long wait you cannot avoid getting on and
off the airplane.  Every flight, every
airline and every zone has the same problem. 
You hurry to get in line only to find yourself waiting to get through
several segmented lines.  You have the
line to scan your ticket, then a line in the connector hallway, and then a line
when stepping on the plane and another to find your seat, and one more to place
your bag and get seated.  And this all
happens after you spent 40 minutes waiting for your zone to be called.
Often times we spend more time waiting than actually on our
flight.  This fact is exactly how I came
up with my solution.  A few years ago I
realized I was waiting longer than I was flying.  Then I started to research and I realized
that the airlines are only making money when airplanes are flying.  So the airlines want a solution just as badly
as the disgruntled flier.  And this was
the beginning of my journey.
Several months and over 2,100 hours of researching,
simulating, testing, and prototyping, later, Dynaerobridge, a jet way that
provides multiple access points to aircraft, has sparked the interest of
airports and was selected as first-place winner of Discovery Day, a research
competition hosted by the Office of Undergraduate Research at Embry-Riddle
Aeronautical University, Florida on April 13. Dynaerobridge was also the
recipient of the People’s Choice Award at the “Launch Your Venture”
Entrepreneurship Expo at Embry-Riddle’s College of Business on April 12.





I want you to see the vision behind this venture, so I’ve explained more about it below. You’ll find out WHAT I am doing, WHEN I am doing it, WHO I am, WHY this campaign matters so much, and HOW you can help.




Last Spring I worked with Airline Optimization and
Simulation System experts to test the time savings capability of Dynaerobridge. We
tested Dynaerobridge in worse case scenarios to see the minimum amount of
boarding and deplaning time that could be saved if airlines adopted this
innovative jet bridge. Using our proprietary method, it takes on average, 7 to 9 minutes  to board 137 passengers with carry-ons
through the front and rear door of a Boeing 737-700. This time savings is ground
breaking considering that it currently takes airlines 30-40 minutes to board
the same number of passengers. Similarly, using Dynaerobridge, deplaning 137
passengers only takes on average, 5 to 7
minutes.  Again, this is revolutionary!  













Dynaerobridge is an add-on system that can be attached to existing jet bridges, allowing passengers to board or disembark an airplane through multiple access doors, simultaneously. Dynaerobridge offers airlines and airports worldwide a cost-effective solution to increase efficiency, customer satisfaction, and profitability.



As you can see from the video, by removing the issue of that gridlock as everyone enters through the same door,  Dynaerobridge makes it easy for everyone to get on and off the plane fast and safe.


Most air travelers have common story of misery about their experience during the boarding process through a single door.  But that is about to change. Dynaerobridge will allow passenger to exit the aircraft through the access door closer to their seat, removing the need to exit the aircraft through a single door, which is usually at the forward side of the aircraft. With Dynaerobridge, passengers with tight connecting flights can exit the aircraft in time to catch their next flight.The usage of Dynaerobridge means that you would be able get to your gate 10 minutes before departure and still be able to catch your flight. It means less missed connecting flights, easy boarding for the handicapped, elderly, those traveling with infants, more time in the air and less waiting, happier customers, more revenue for airlines, lower ticket costs for those who like to fly with low cost carriers, and overall a more seamless flying experience for everyone: pilots, operators, flyers and flight attendants.  And this is what we have been looking for so long.  A solution that pleases every party while remaining safe, cost effective and enjoyable.


The
purpose of this campaign is to raise  money to create further test the design and engineering features of Dynaerobridge. This will be accomplished through  the development of a scaled model prototype. Once the design and engineering testings are complete, the next phase will be to enter into licensing agreement with companies who already manufacture jet ways.
The prices for jetways  can go anywhere between $350K to $4M   so in order to begin manufacturing Dynaerobridge myself, I will need at least $5M. Although I will be amazed and humbled if I could raise that amount here on Indiegogo,  at this initial stage, I am considering licensing Dynaerobridge so it can get to airports as soon as possible.  
From my end, I have single handedly funded this project from design to getting a patent. That is because because I believe in the Dynaerobridge’s potential of making air travel less stressful for frequent air travelers. You too can contribute to see this dream come true!





I have taken the time to get nearly everything in place before launching this campaign. I took the risk up front by delaying the launch of this campaign until I believed it was ready, to lessen the risk to my backers. I have worked with industry experts to test the Dynaerobridge’s time savings, and the results are remarkable. There is little or no risk here. As explained earlier, Jet ways cost anywhere from $350K to $4M each so my intention is not to start production. Rather, my goal is to raise enough money to develop a demonstration prototype, which will be used to pitch to those who have the means to make the Dynaerobridge a reality such as airport and airlines.  I have the backing of a great team so I don't predict many obstacles here.  But there is always the unknown. I will face every obstacle with the same tenacity and perseverance that I have had from the start.





Money is not everything. If you are still reading this, it means that you are interest in seeing Dynaerobridge become something that can be seen at every airport and I really appreciate you for that. You can help me reach my funding goal by sharing this campaign using Indiegogo share tools on your social media page so we can get Dynaerobridge trending.





First off, yes my real name is Dynamite.  So you can imagine the pressure I feel with a name like that. (kidding) Dynamite originates from the Greek word – “Dunamis” which means power.  So my goal is to use my strength in problem solving, my devotion to learning and my passion for helping others, to make this come to life.
I was born in the war-torn part of northern Nigeria but I immigrated to the USA in 2010 to pursue my passion for aviation. Currently, I am an aerospace engineering senior at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Florida. I am concentrating in aeronautics with minors in aeronautical studies, aviation safety, and commercial space operations. I have worked on several aerospace projects including a Single Person Spacecraft (SPS), as well as a low –orbital, Satellite Imaging System.  I have  also played the role of chairperson for the design, construction and development of Eco-dolphin, a fleet of three Autonomous Underwater Vehicle, designed to monitor coastal environments and help researchers study underwater life. 



Because it will be unrealistic and of no use to ship a Dynaerobridge to each supporter, I had to come up with a smart and creative way to reward Dynaerobridge's fans for all their support and donations. I am very blessed to have the support of great artists from different parts of the world who have agreed to help me out with my perks. These artists see the potential in Dynaerobridge and its potential to change the way we board and exit airplanes that they all have gone  out of their ways to release the rights of their work at no additional cost. In order words, you are free to use the perk(s) you get through this campaign for anything you like because you will not be infringing on, or violating the artist's copyrights.

About my wife and me
 
     We have just started to built our dream: we have bought the land that we have been waiting for so long. Now we can start building our own Hotel.

About the Hotel
 
     Right now we are working in the plan and adjusting the construction budget. The hotel is situated 400 meters from the beach named Playa Punta Popy, in Las Terrenas, in the north coast of Dominican Republic.
 

 
The houses will be built in a creole-victorian style, very similar to this 3D recreations:
 


 
You will find:

8 double rooms of 31 square meters each with 7 square meters of terrace, complete bathroom with shower, big closet, queen size bed, air conditioning and private external shower.
2 double rooms with the same characteristics as the other ones but with a private external jacuzzi.
Free wi-fi
A swimming pool with a wide place to sunbath or simply rest in the comfortable loungers.
Private, guarded and free parking.
24 hours surveillance.
Common area for breakfast and bar service under an spectacular and cozy palapa.

 

 

Big smiles. Shoes are optional.
Punta Popy Hotel will only allow guests over 16 years old and will not accept any kind of pets.


 
Let’s go
 
     We need the funds for the total construction of the hotel. The construction will start in December 2018 - January 2019 and will take 6 or 7 months. We will be ready to receive our guests and friends in September 2019.
    This will be a living project that you can follow in our instagram (hotelpuntapopy). We will update once or twice a month with pictures and/or videos the evolution of construction so you can see the results of your collaborations and you can start the countdown for your holidays.
     Right now we are ready to show you the project blueprints that we have just finished:

I have learned throughout my life that it pays to be patient and plan in stages. So here is my plan for phase 1:</p><ul>
<li>Raise CAD$12,000 to be able to go back to Thailand and purchase at least 1000 genuine leather insoles.</li>
<li>Purchase enough water resistant fabric to be able to have all 1000+ Sole-Safes completed.</li>
<li>Have marketing materials and plastic-free packaging printed.</li>
<li>$12,000 is not much but will get me going. I might not be able to take much profit at this point, if any, but it will be enough to get the ball rolling.</li>
</ul><p>At this point, I am able to source out manual labour to an experienced individual with a sewing machine, or small sewing shop.</p><p><strong>Phase 2</strong></p><p>To be able to set up my own shop in Thailand with only CAD$12,000 is rather unrealistic and hence calls for phase 2:</p><ul>
<li>Once I have established my systems and produced the first 1000+ units, I will step up my marketing strategy and advertise Sole-Safe with the goal of 1000+ orders per month.</li>
<li>I will advertise Sole-Safe to stores as well as online.</li>
<li>This is also where I will be able to commit to renting a space, buying equipment like sewing machines and cutting tables, and hiring my own team; a seamstresses or two, a shipper, and someone to process incoming orders.</li>
<li>But first things first, let’s focus on phase 1 for now.</li>
</ul><p>What you get in return for backing my campaign is a super deal on the pre-purchase of your Sole-Safes.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>I truly believe in my idea and being able to jumpstart it on Indiegogo would mean that I am actually creating a viable business that allows me to pay fair, living wages to the people I am working with, while equally making and honest living to support my own family.</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>My main challenge is that I will not get enough orders to be able to immediately manufacture in Thailand. To set up shop there, I will need approximately 1000 pre-orders. And even at that point it will be a tight squeeze.</p><p>However, regardless of how many Sole-Safes I am able to pre-sell through my Indiegogo campaign, I guarantee you your purchase. I have been an entrepreneur and craftsman for most of my adult life and am more than happy to make every single Sole-Safe in my living room until all orders have been satisfied.</p><p>So even though my preference is to create a company that offers opportunities to low income families in Thailand earning a fair, living wage, I have no problem with getting my own hands involved in production.</p><p><strong>Returns</strong></p><p>If we accidentally sent you the wrong size, or if there is anything wrong with your Sole-Safes, we will send you a replacement free of charge and you are welcome to keep the pair that we sent you in error. Clear proof of damage or wrong sizing must be included in your documentation. I.e. a photo with a measuring tape next to your unaltered Sole-Safes or pictures of inadequate stitching will do the job.</p><p>If, by accident, you ordered the wrong size we would like to suggest that you gift the erroneously ordered pair to friend or family member and order a new pair at your own expense.

Let me know how many Sole-Safes you would like and I will create a special perk just for you ---Introducing the Original Sole-Safe, a smart and effective way to tuck away some back-up cash while trotting the globe. Keep yourself safe from pickpockets and have that cash that pays for your trip to the next consulate, your hotel, or a replacement passport.  Sole-Safe, the insole that doubles as a hiding spot for your back-up cash just in case your wallet goes missing.I trotted the globe for many years, and, like anyone who loves to travel, spent many a days worrying about the safety of my hard earned cash.                  During my travels, I met numerous people who lost all their money, credit cards, and passport. Some fell victim to a pair of nifty long-fingers where others simply forgot part of their luggage while getting on or off a bus, plane, train or ferry. Having a few bills tucked away in a place that is least likely to fall into the hands of the criminal minded can make all the difference.Sole-Safes are made from genuine leather and water resistant fabric. Both sides, left and right, have a pocket sewn under. Lost your wallet on a crazy night out? Have that cab fare hidden in your Sole-Safe!        Sole-Safes make great gifts for: 
Anyone who loves to travel, may it be your children, friends, or classmates. 
Your elderly parents touring Italy or spending their winters in a more pleasant climate.
Snowbirds (that's a Canadian thing :))
Exchange students. 
Business travellers who go to places of lesser safety.
NGO's and volunteers who try to make the world a better place. 
Really anyone can benefit from a little extra safety pretty much anywhere in the world.
Think Christmas: Sole-Safes make great stocking stuffers!
Volunteering in Peru or teaching English in Shanghai? Sole-Safe is for you!On beer tour in Europe! Dude, you need Sole-Safe!Exploring Uzbekistan or Bhutan? Don’t leave without Sole-Safe!Sole-Safes are safest on your feet. So if you take your shoes off to enter that temple in Chiang Mai don’t leave them out for the taking!          Other ways to benefit from Sole-Safes are:
Getting stuck in a disaster zone. 
You spent all your cash on your stag or bachelor party in Las Vegas and find yourself ""Hangover"" style in the wrong part of town, your wallet is missing, and the only thing you are wearing are your shoes.
Being involved in an accident while travelling.
Your credit card is short $50 on that 800 Dollar pair of shoes you really want. Then you suddenly remember that you have some cash hidden in your shoe.
You simply want to make sure that your children will never get stuck somewhere in a situation where they cannot make their way back home.
If the world is your playground....
Living in a large metropolis? Are thieves and pickpockets part of your landscape? You don't need to travel to justify a pair of Sole-Safes! All you need is to live in a not-so-safe-kind-of-place.  Stinky money?We tested Sole-Safes for several months traveling through Europe and Asia and found that there was no unpleasant smell on the bills we walked on. However, if you should have concerns based on your own stinky feet being stinkier than mine or those of my friends, you can always use a small ziplock bag to protect your hard earned cash from money munching bacteria. But then again, better to have some stinky money than have no money at all...The Dont'sWe do not recommend inserting credit cards into our product or over-stuffing it with money. However, a photocopy of your travel documents may be wise to add as a backup to assist with their replacement in case of loss.Sole-Safe does not condone the illegal import/export of money or counterban.If you should be so unlucky that you do lose the content of your Sole-Safes, we from Sole-Safe shall, of course, not be held responsible under any circumstances.All our packaging will be PLASTIC FREE!!! Sole-Safe is for a clean environment, everywhere! Please reduce your use of plastic products while travelling. Plastic is poison.SizesClearly state your shoe size in an email to us! You can use US/Canadian, UK, or Euro sizing, or measure your feet in centimeters or inches. Sole-Safe comes in sizes of i.e. 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12 etc.. You may need to trim your Sole-Safes slightly for that perfect fit. A sizing pattern is included in your package.What We Need & What You GetPhase 1The dream of any entrepreneur is always to start with a big bang. I have learned throughout my life that it pays to be patient and plan in stages. So here is my plan for phase 1:
Raise CAD$12,000 to be able to go back to Thailand and purchase at least 1000 genuine leather insoles.
Purchase enough water resistant fabric to be able to have all 1000+ Sole-Safes completed.
Have marketing materials and plastic-free packaging printed.
$12,000 is not much but will get me going. I might not be able to take much profit at this point, if any, but it will be enough to get the ball rolling.
At this point, I am able to source out manual labour to an experienced individual with a sewing machine, or small sewing shop.Phase 2To be able to set up my own shop in Thailand with only CAD$12,000 is rather unrealistic and hence calls for phase 2:
Once I have established my systems and produced the first 1000+ units, I will step up my marketing strategy and advertise Sole-Safe with the goal of 1000+ orders per month.
I will advertise Sole-Safe to stores as well as online.
This is also where I will be able to commit to renting a space, buying equipment like sewing machines and cutting tables, and hiring my own team; a seamstresses or two, a shipper, and someone to process incoming orders.
But first things first, let’s focus on phase 1 for now.
What you get in return for backing my campaign is a super deal on the pre-purchase of your Sole-Safes.The ImpactI truly believe in my idea and being able to jumpstart it on Indiegogo would mean that I am actually creating a viable business that allows me to pay fair, living wages to the people I am working with, while equally making and honest living to support my own family.Risks & ChallengesMy main challenge is that I will not get enough orders to be able to immediately manufacture in Thailand. To set up shop there, I will need approximately 1000 pre-orders. And even at that point it will be a tight squeeze.However, regardless of how many Sole-Safes I am able to pre-sell through my Indiegogo campaign, I guarantee you your purchase. I have been an entrepreneur and craftsman for most of my adult life and am more than happy to make every single Sole-Safe in my living room until all orders have been satisfied.So even though my preference is to create a company that offers opportunities to low income families in Thailand earning a fair, living wage, I have no problem with getting my own hands involved in production.ReturnsIf we accidentally sent you the wrong size, or if there is anything wrong with your Sole-Safes, we will send you a replacement free of charge and you are welcome to keep the pair that we sent you in error. Clear proof of damage or wrong sizing must be included in your documentation. I.e. a photo with a measuring tape next to your unaltered Sole-Safes or pictures of inadequate stitching will do the job.If, by accident, you ordered the wrong size we would like to suggest that you gift the erroneously ordered pair to friend or family member and order a new pair at your own expense. Your return shipping charges in addition to our ridiculous $10 you-ordered-the-wrong-size-return-fee adds up to pretty much the same price of a new pair. So make sure you order the right size. Our price guarantee will make sure that you will pay no more than you paid for your initial purchase, even if the Perk you chose should not be available any longer. Please expect normal wear and tear, nothing lasts forever. However, you should be able to get great mileage out of your purchase.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease share my campaign with your family, friends, clients, customers and coworkers. Please share through your social network in any way you feel comfortable and as many times as you like. Please share share share…Thank you'sBig thanks go out to my friends Richard, who was my cameraman, and Grant, who gave me such a fantastic product review in my video.

A huge thank you to the generous couple who gifted me their vintage sewing machine so I was able to make my prototypes.

<div>Domein Reynaert is geboren uit de liefde voor fermentatie.</div>
<div>Na een opleiding tot Zytholoog (biersommelier) zijn we begonnen met het thuis brouwen van ons eigen bier. Bij vele vrienden viel het in de smaak.</div>
<div>Door het opvolgen van het fermentatieproces begon de liefde te ontluiken voor ambachtelijke bereidingen (bier, wijn, sake, ...).</div>
<div>Omdat we in onze toenmalige woonst in Melsele hiervoor te krap behuisd waren gingen we op zoek naar wat meer plaats. Dit vonden we in Beveren, vlak bij Vrasene. Een huis met tuin en een stukje landbouwgrond waar we aan onze hobbies konden uitwerken.</div>
<div>Weigerend om het klein te zien is toen Domein Reynaert opgericht, vanwege onze affectie met het Waasland was de naamskeuze snel gemaakt.</div>
<div>Er werd begonnen met ons eerste bier: ""Nobel"", naar koning Nobel uit de sage ""Van den Vos Reynaerde"". (De koning is de eerste burger van het land, toepasselijk dus om ons eerste bier naar hem te dopen)<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439042438/ghmgakhewqvykpllga1t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>De vele positieve commentaren en een vlotte verkoop gaven ons de kans om daarnaast ook uit te komen met ons tweede bier: ""Ysengrin"", de eerste klager aan het hof van koning Nobel.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439042150/aztereb6qxkzyoxcdvjl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>Dit alles hebben we zelf gedaan, de bieren zijn we gaan brouwen in Brouwerij 't Kroontje in Denderbelle... Maar zouden graag nu de stap wagen om een eigen micro-brouwerij met proeflokaal op te richten, en zo Beveren (met z'n rijke brouwerij geschiedenis - <a href=""http://www.bloggen.be/brouwerijenwaasland"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bloggen.be/brouwerijenwaasland</a> ) eindelijk terug zijn eigen brouwerij te geven!</div>
<h3>Eigen inbreng</h3>
<div>Over de afgelopen 2 jaar hebben we elke eigen euro in ons huis en het domein gestoken. Met de nodige bankleningen hebben we alles kunnen verbouwen.</div>
<div>Nu onze beide bieren op de markt zijn (en we plannen hebben voor meer) vonden we de tijd rijp om uit te kijken om onze bieren ook daadwerkelijk in onze eigen achtertuin te kunnen maken.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Hoe willen we dit doen?</h3>
<div>Om deze plannen uit te voeren hebben we goed rondgekeken naar de juiste oplossing voor onze situatie. </div>

Omdat we in onze toenmalige woonst in Melsele hiervoor te krap behuisd waren gingen we op zoek naar wat meer plaats. Dit vonden we in Beveren, vlak bij Vrasene. Een huis met tuin en een stukje landbouwgrond waar we aan onze hobbies konden uitwerken.
Weigerend om het klein te zien is toen Domein Reynaert opgericht, vanwege onze affectie met het Waasland was de naamskeuze snel gemaakt.
Er werd begonnen met ons eerste bier: ""Nobel"", naar koning Nobel uit de sage ""Van den Vos Reynaerde"". (De koning is de eerste burger van het land, toepasselijk dus om ons eerste bier naar hem te dopen)

De vele positieve commentaren en een vlotte verkoop gaven ons de kans om daarnaast ook uit te komen met ons tweede bier: ""Ysengrin"", de eerste klager aan het hof van koning Nobel.

Dit alles hebben we zelf gedaan, de bieren zijn we gaan brouwen in Brouwerij 't Kroontje in Denderbelle... Maar zouden graag nu de stap wagen om een eigen micro-brouwerij met proeflokaal op te richten, en zo Beveren (met z'n rijke brouwerij geschiedenis - http://www.bloggen.be/brouwerijenwaasland ) eindelijk terug zijn eigen brouwerij te geven!
Eigen inbreng
Over de afgelopen 2 jaar hebben we elke eigen euro in ons huis en het domein gestoken. Met de nodige bankleningen hebben we alles kunnen verbouwen.
Nu onze beide bieren op de markt zijn (en we plannen hebben voor meer) vonden we de tijd rijp om uit te kijken om onze bieren ook daadwerkelijk in onze eigen achtertuin te kunnen maken.   Hoe willen we dit doen?
Om deze plannen uit te voeren hebben we goed rondgekeken naar de juiste oplossing voor onze situatie. 
Hoeveel hebben we nodig?


€ 12.000,- Gebouw voor proeflokaal en productieruimte






€ 5.000,- Inrichting van productieruimte

€ 15.000,- Brouwinstallatie, gisttanks & klein materiaal






€ 2.500,- Beginstock grondstoffen






Dit brengt ons op een totaal van € 34.500,- welke we moeten investeren om alles klaar te krijgen voor de opstart en houdt nog geen rekening met diverse kleine kosten.

Van dit bedrag hebben we al een deel kunnen bekomen van familie en vrienden, maar voor het grootste stuk willen we graag de community betrekken.
Wat geven we jou ervoor terug?
We hebben als dankbetuigingen enkele rewards gepland:


€ 5,- : Een bedankings e-mail en registratie voor onze online nieuwsbrief
€ 15,- : Een glas van Domein Reynaert, dat je in het proeflokaal mag afhalen samen met een gratis consumptie ter plaatse. (+ reward 1)
€ 20,- : T-Shirt, op te halen in ons proeflokaal, bovenop reward 2
€ 25,- : T-Shirt, Glas en 1 bier, verzonden via Kiala naar een punt in jouw buurt.
€ 50,- : MUUR. In ons proeflokaal reserveren we 1 muur waar jouw naam zal worden gegraveerd bij iedereen die ons vanaf dit bedrag steunde (+ reward 3)
€ 75,- : Brouwer voor een dag! Je wordt uitgenodigd om een dagje mee te komen brouwen. (afhankelijk van beschikbaarheid) (+ reward 5)
€ 100,- : Beer Taster. Elk experiment, speciaal brouwsel of colab roepen we jou op, op een door ons gekozen dag, om het bier te onderwerpen aan jouw smaak en beoordeling. (+ reward 5) (max 15)
€ 150,- : Launch Party! Je zal worden uitgenodigd om samen met een vriend(in) deel te nemen aan de lancering van ons eerste thuisgebrouwen bier. Receptie, bierdiner en afterparty. Na afloop neem je een van de eerste lokaal gebrouwen bakken mee naar huis!
€ 180,- : Beer Taster + 1. Zelfde als reward 7, en breng telkens een vriend mee!
€ 250,- : Eerste bier van de maand. Kom levenslang elke maand een gratis biertje drinken in ons proeflokaal! (+ reward 5) (bij begin nieuwe maand vervalt de vorige maand, exclusief speciale, experimenten en/of colab's)
€ 360,- : Bakje (b)hier! Kom jaarlijks een volledige bak bier uit ons assortiment ophalen (24x33cl, mag gemixed, exclusief leeggoed en uitgezonderd speciale, experimenten en/of colab's).
€ 500,- : Bakje (b)hier Spécial! Zelfde als reward 11, maar ook voor speciale, experimenten en/of colab's (let wel, kom tijdig want OP = OP!).
€ 800,- : My Taste, My Beer! Stel samen met ons een bier samen! We brouwen dit bier en brengen het op de markt met de door jou gegeven naam en met jouw naam en foto op het etiket (wil je dit liever niet? Dan doen we dit niet). (+ reward 5)
€ 1.000,- : Gist tank. We graveren jouw naam in één van onze gisttanks en vermelden op het etiket van het bier dat het dankzij jou tot stand kwam! (max 5)
€ 2.000,- BUNDLE! Reward 14 + 13 + 12
€ 5.000,- Dank je om zo in ons te geloven! Neem voor toe te zeggen contact met ons op en we werken een reward uit die reflecteerd wat dit voor ons betekent!

Hoe verdelen we het geld?
Wat als er geld over is?
Als er nog fondsen over zijn, worden die gebruikt voor de uitbouw van ons terrein en ons biergamma. We kunnen ervoor zorgen dat we voldoende capaciteit hebben (brouw, warme kamer, koude kamer, stockage) en natuurlijk voor beleving. Ontvangen van scholen/groepen om hen wegwijs te maken in de wereld van het bier.
Wat als we niet aan het beoogde bedrag geraken?
Dan gaan de plannen nog steeds door!
We zullen blijven brouwen en sparen voor het proeflokaal en de brouwerij! Alle rewards zullen beschikbaar blijven om uit te voeren (behalve rewards 5, 10, 12 en 13. Hiervoor zoeken we een passend alternatief. Reward 8 zal wel doorgaan met een bak gebrouwen bij 't Kroontje als -take home gift-).
Maar we hopen dat dit niet nodig zal zijn.

    Impact
Als deze crowdfunding campagne lukt, kunnen we Beveren terug een brouwerij geven! Honderden jaren brouwgeschiedenis zullen terug tot leven komen in het proeflokaal en iedereen kan dan weer van plaatselijk gerstenat genieten!
    Risico's
Natuurlijk zijn er risico's verbonden aan deze crowdfunding.
Maar geen waar we geen weg rond zullen vinden.
Mocht het toch gebeuren dat we niet het nodige kapitaal bijeen krijgen, dan zullen we voort blijven doen zoals we nu reeds bezig zijn, en sparen om toch aan een proeflokaal te geraken.
Andere manieren om te helpen?
 Je bent financieel niet in de mogelijkheid om ons te steunen op dit moment? Geen probleem! Je kan ons nog op verschillende manieren helpen, bvb:


Heb je nog memorabilia van oude Wase brouwerijen? Je mag deze altijd doneren of in bruikleen geven voor de opsmuk van het proeflokaal.
Kom geregeld een biertje drinken vanaf we open zijn.
Groene vingers? Een grote tuin vereist meerdere handen. Als je ons wilt komen helpen, steeds welkom!
Deel deze crowdfunding met je vrienden! Hoe meer zielen, hoe meer vreugd.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TAILGATE WITH AMERICAN WOOD.</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">FratWood began building custom tables for fraternities in 2017. What originally started as a few fraternity brothers building tables in a sketchy garage quickly turned into something so much more. Our first bulk order was to a fraternity at Indiana University, and after a small hiccup with the drug dealing neighbors, freight fraud, and a police escort to our garage, the tables made it safe and sound to Indiana and FratWood was born.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549679511/glsavmlkbmvi3y9qsmjq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> FratWood was a good idea, even Billy McFarland agreed. After pitching FratWood to Billy, he offered us a jaw-dropping amount of money to make FratWood the biggest fraternity table and beer dye company the United States had ever seen. One month later, after several insufficient wire transfers, Fyre Festival blew up and Billy was arrested. FratWood lived on. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Now, FratWood is the leading wooden tailgating table company. FratWood builds luxury wooden tailgating tables for the men and women who want to make a statement with their wood, not with plastic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our mission is to fight imported plastic by bringing American wood to tailgates. We knew this wouldn't be possible with a poorly made table... so we teamed up with one of the top woodworkers in Oregon and designed a beautiful, unique, foldable and transportable wooden table. Be proud of what you’re part of and represent it right. Life is short, might as well show off your wood.</p>

</div></div>","ENOUGH OF THE IMPORTED PLASTIC TABLES. 
TAILGATE WITH AMERICAN WOOD.
 
FratWood began building custom tables for fraternities in 2017. What originally started as a few fraternity brothers building tables in a sketchy garage quickly turned into something so much more. Our first bulk order was to a fraternity at Indiana University, and after a small hiccup with the drug dealing neighbors, freight fraud, and a police escort to our garage, the tables made it safe and sound to Indiana and FratWood was born.

 FratWood was a good idea, even Billy McFarland agreed. After pitching FratWood to Billy, he offered us a jaw-dropping amount of money to make FratWood the biggest fraternity table and beer dye company the United States had ever seen. One month later, after several insufficient wire transfers, Fyre Festival blew up and Billy was arrested. FratWood lived on. 
Now, FratWood is the leading wooden tailgating table company. FratWood builds luxury wooden tailgating tables for the men and women who want to make a statement with their wood, not with plastic.
Our mission is to fight imported plastic by bringing American wood to tailgates. We knew this wouldn't be possible with a poorly made table... so we teamed up with one of the top woodworkers in Oregon and designed a beautiful, unique, foldable and transportable wooden table. Be proud of what you’re part of and represent it right. Life is short, might as well show off your wood.
LONG LIVE THE FRATWOOD

FRATWOOD TABLES
 
Right now, we offer the House Table. The House Table is our big boy, meaning this table is thick and durable:

Table Length: 8 feet
Table Width: 4 feet
Table Height: 30 inches 
Table Weight: 150lbs  
Folded dimensions: 4 feet x 4 feet x 6 inches  
Surface Wood: Washington State Birch 
Leg and Apron Wood: Oregon Wild Douglas Fir 

We offer the House Table either NAKED or CUSTOM.
 
NAKED

 
Just as the name suggests, this table is naked. No stain, no print, just the table. We want to give our customer the ability to buy our tables NAKED, not just to offer a cheaper price for the House Table, but to allow a 100% customizable experience. With the NAKED option, customers can paint their own table, cover it with stickers, pictures, you name it. Create your own masterpiece, and send us photos by messaging us through our Instagram (@fratwood). Your photo could be featured on our Instagram. 
Price: $699.99
 
CUSTOM


Our CUSTOM House Table comes with your choice of stain and logo. We hand-stain the table and then print your logo directly onto the wood surface using state of the art UV LED Printing Technology. The table is then finished with a protectant coat. The CUSTOM House Table is truly a work of time, precision, and art. 
Price: $899.99
 
*We do not condone standing, sitting, jumping, or placing any weight of over 80lbs on our tables as this could be dangerous and result in damage or destruction of the table as well as personal injury.*
 

Why are we raising money? 
There are three reasons why we are raising money: 

To fund the prototyping and production of our new Tailgater Table
To fund official NCAA/Greek Life licensing
To build a CUSTOM Table design studio on our website

We will be running this as a 20-day campaign and are leveraging our USA based manufacturers that we have worked with on past projects to ensure fast delivery. Engineered Safety: Fold-Away Feature, Side Guards and Brass Hook What sets our tool apart is the fold-away feature with internal Teflon side guards paired with a Brass Hook.  Fold-Away FeatureThe fold-away feature sheaths the hook into the body of the tool. Single piece tools do not store the contact surface leaving things it is exposed to such as your pocket, keys or counters. Stay safe and tuck it away!.   Teflon Side GuardsTwo internal Teflon side guards ensure that the hook does not touch the body of the tool when storing into the handle. Brass HookThe no-touch hook is designed out of brass.  Research completed by the American Society for Microbiology, has firmly established helpful properties of copper and brass surfaces.  Stop FeatureA uniquely designed pivot point with an O-ring allows the brass hook to flip out similar to a pocket knife and ensures that the tool remains in the open or closed position. Exploded View Everyday UsesUse our tool to protect yourself whether you are out and about shopping or when opening packages delivered to your home.Door OpenerButton PusherTouchscreensBox OpenerKeypadsBag CarrierKeyring Carry Our Commitment to YouWe know that there are certain concerns around transparency, communication, and delivering on crowdfunding campaigns.

Thanks for doing it right!” - Josh G.I’ve backed nearly a hundred crowdfunded campaigns over the last six years and this is, by far, the best-run one I’ve backed. I wish that some of the radio-silent creators I’m still waiting on would take to heart Brian’s approach to communicating what’s going on, as in update #9. (And, of course, that things appear to be going really well doesn’t hurt matters… ;)” – Andy D.“Reordered.  Just wanted to let you know, I’ve contributed to over 10 Indiegogo campaigns.  You were by far the best in terms of communication and project management.”  – Mike P.“Not only a great product you are providing, but also formidable campaign management. I encouraged everyone I know with interest in such tools to support the campaign. Again, thank you very much for such a great tool.” – Manuel T.“This is staying on my key ring forever! Overall this has been the BEST run campaigns on Indiegogo. Brian is simply fantastic! He’s the gold standard for developers and campaigners. There are many who could learn from him.” – Anand J.“The quality of this tool is very nice and it will definitely fit in well with my EDC. Thanks for showing good production, operation and delivery standards.” – John W.“3 HUGE, LOUD CHEERS for Brian and family on the wonderful progress! Thank you all for your commitment, long hours of hard work, and vision. You’re creating a support useful tool for EDC.” – Dean W.""You are the exemplar in how to run an Indiegogo campaign.

 The most advanced brake sensor technologyThe Raz Pro adopts the highest accuracy 6-axis motion-based position detection technology, which makes it different from most brake tail light on the market. This means you can mount the Raz Pro at different angles — and it would be the perfect fit even for an inclined frame.More accurate with enhanced algorithmRaz pro is set up with different braking algorithm under different riding occasions. Thus enhances the brake sensitivity and reduces the brake misjudge.  And that's not allRaz Pro is not just a tail light: it’s packed with intelligent sensors and back-up features for a truly comfortable ride: Light Sensor, Auto Brake Alerts, Road Bump Alerts and Auto Wake-Up.  Light SensorRaz Pro knows when it's dark and knows when it's bright. It will automatically turn on and off depending on the outside conditions letting you focus on the road ahead. If you are not using your bike for over 4 minutes, the light will turn off automatically to save battery.  Auto Wake-up Raz Pro is ready when you are. Simply hop on the bike and start moving and the light will turn on automatically — no buttons to press or settings to tweak with. Road Bump AlertsRaz Pro is an explorer. Heading off the main road? No worries, Raz got your back. The Road Bump Alert feature will make the light turn white every time you encounter a bump in the road warning the cyclists behind you.  Sync with Discovery Pro GPS UnitSimply pair the Discovery Pro bike computer with Raz Pro via Bluetooth and the Discovery Pro's warning light will instantly sync with the Raz Pro and adopt the same color and lighting mode. Full-Color Daytime LightRaz is versatile. You can pick and choose between a full range of color options for the light via the Shanren Sports App. Here, you can also adjust the flashing modes and select preferred patterns. 80 hours on a single chargeRaz Pro can be easily charged with its handy magnetic charger and won't need to be recharged for another 80 hours of standard use — which is plenty for both daily commute and long relaxing bike rides.  Installation & MountsRaz Pro comes with a Twist & Lock mount and optional brackets for seat posts, saddles or helmets. You will be able to fix the tail light in place in no time and it will stay securely in its place even throughout the bounciest of rides.  DesignIt took us over 3 years to develop, engineer and design Raz Pro. We have taken the time to bring the product to life subjecting it to rounds of rigorous testing and gathering feedback from prototypes to make further improvements. The manufacturing of every single Raz requires 60 seconds of laser etching, extensive waterproofing (IP68) and extensive performance and endurance tests. As a result, you are getting a bike light that will be a reliable companion for all your bike trips, no matter the weather or terrain.  SpecificationsModel: SR-BTL20Connection: BLE4.0Battery: Rechargeable Li-batteryRecharge: Magnetic chargingRecharge time: 2 hoursWork time: 24-80 hoursBrightness:60lmWaterproof: IP68Size: 41X41X19mmWeight: 20gAPP support: Shanren SportIOS & Android devices: iOS 7.0 or later, Android 4.3 or later. Meet ShanrenOur story began in 2012 as three young professionals from the fields of electronics, products development and the internet started a company named SHANREN.  The name of our company reflects one of our key principles: people living in harmony with nature — and, as a tech company, we incorporate this principle into the design and functionality of our products: innovative high level fitness and health tracking devices for cycling enthusiasts.Over the 7 years on the cycling market, we have reengineered our company time and time again to keep up with the growing demands of the cycling industry and opening new avenues for innovation.

In addition to traveling and getting to know new cultures we will do economic studies and comparisons about different factors in each country such as:

The price of water and food 

Ice Creams Around the World 
Evaluation of the country's gastronomy (and the country's coffees!) 
Evaluation of the hospitality and friendliness of the people 
Price of public transport 
Photos of the best places in each country



 
The Book: ""Around The World in 50 days""
- The book will be produced by a portuguese editor.
- The cover of the book will be drawn, free of charge, by a portuguese designer who accepted to be part of our project.
- We'll start creating the book when we get back from the trip. We promise to be as fast as we can, but we have not yet been able to define the date of launch.
- The profits from the book will be donated to charity.
- We chose Unicef ​​to receive the money from the book

<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<p>We’re Ethan and Conner Borlé, brothers from Alberta, Canada. We started a small residential construction business together in 2014 that we named “Borlé Bros. Contracting Corp.” I know, creative right? </p>
<p>We’re eager to start 2019 off with a bang and reach our goal of bringing healthier, durable, energy efficient, and AFFORDABLE homes to the average person.</p>
<p>We want to show you how a modern home can and should be built, so that together we can drive architects, designers, builders, governments and code regulation authorities to do more to ensure we all have better homes to live in.</p>
<p>And we’re going to start off by building a tiny house on wheels to one of the highest, most respected standards in the building industry. And then we’re going to give it away to one of our Indiegogo supporters!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546724625/g2ql0qx2wgm4d2o8ps3d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We’re running an all-or-nothing campaign. That means, if we don’t reach our funding goal, we don’t take any of your money. Your credit card is only charged if we reach our target by our chosen end date. So, you don’t have to worry about winning a half completed tiny house that doesn’t live up to the hype. We only want to go forward with the project if we know we can do it right.</p>
<p>Continue reading to learn how you can support the campaign and win the tiny house for yourself. If you want to know even more visit our webpage (<a href=""https://www.borlebros.ca/tiny-house-for-you.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a>) for loads of additional information!</p>
<h2>Contest Rules</h2>
<p>Contest open to residents of Canada, with the exception of Quebec, who are at least 18 years of age. To enter, make a pledge that is identified as including entry to the contest. Then show us why you should win the house by posting your short story, video, or other artistic work to Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram and tag @borlebros, or send your entry to us by email to tiny4u@borlebros.ca. Contest ends on February 18th, 2019 at 11:59 AM MT and judging will take place thereafter. Prize shipping destination must be within mainland Canada and directly accessible by continuous paved road from the shipping origination point. Limit one (1) entry per person. Only one (1) prize is available throughout Canada. Prize valued at approximately $125,000. Odds of winning depend on the number of entries received and the ability of an entry to achieve a high score.

<p>One of the central tenants of our project is to go way beyond what a code-built house is today.</p>
<p>We want to blow this standard out of the water so we’re targeting LEED Certification, a third-party verified building rating system. So, you’ll know it’s a scientifically verified, better building.</p>
<p>LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is the most used green building rating system in the world. LEED helps drive the creation of healthy, highly efficient and cost-saving structures through an adaptable credit system which spans an array of building related issues. To reach our goal of becoming LEED Certified we’ll be addressing such things as:</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>The impact of our campaign might seem clear, one deserving individual is going to walk away with a fully functioning tiny house, and a stellar one at that!</p>
<p>But we hope the campaign has a farther reaching and longer lasting impact than that. You see, most of us are living in sub-optimal conditions and we don’t even know it! We’ve been in these conditions for so long we just don’t realize what are homes and workspaces are doing to us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling tired all the time? It could be because there is not enough ventilation in your home, leading to lower oxygen levels, or perhaps the lighting isn’t designed with your natural circadian rhythm in mind.</li>
<li>Contaminants in the air can make us fall ill more frequently, causing us to miss work and time with our families and friends.</li>
<li> Productivity levels are lower in these poorly designed environments.</li>
<li>Buildings have a negative impact on the environment, not just when they are being built, but every day they operate afterwards.</li>
<li>Many of us experience chronic stress due to the never-ending mortgage payments, utility bills, and maintenance expenses that arise with home ownership.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to show as many people as possible that they don’t have to put up with these typical symptoms of a “sick” building. And we want to help people get into these healthier buildings by making all our planning documents available at a fraction of their actual cost, literally less than 1% of what we’re paying for them! We’re also focusing on a smaller, more adaptable design to keep the build costs low and in recognition of the fact that more square footage does not equal more happiness.</p>
<h2>The Team</h2>
<p>We’ve teamed up with multiple companies and professionals in the field to make sure our design is the best it can be. </p>

<p>Ethan Borlé graduated from university in 2013 with a Bachelor of Commerce and cofounded Borlé Bros. Contracting Corp. shortly after with his brother in 2014. While managing the day-to-day aspects of the business Ethan also pursued further education in the field, completing a Diploma in Renewable Energy and Conservation in 2017. Additionally, he is continually updating his knowledge through training provided by the Canadian Green Building Council and the US Green Building Council and received his LEED Green Associate accreditation, also in 2017. He has also presented twice at the Building Lasting Change Conference hosted by the CaGBC in the Emerging Green Professionals Innovation Challenge.</p>
<p>Conner Borlé helped found BBCC in 2014 while pursuing a Bachelor of Secondary Education. He graduated in 2015 with a Major in Physics and a Minor in Mathematics. During his first year of teaching he was nominated for the Edwin Parr Teacher Award for Outstanding New Teachers and won in his school division.  As a teacher, Conner recognizes the importance of education in driving change and is spearheading the educational component of our tiny-house campaign. His goal is to complete the successful campaign with not just one tiny-home winner, but an entire host of people ready to demand more from their homes, the professionals who build them, and the governments who permit them.</p>
<h2>Design Requirements</h2>
<p>As stated, we’ve got some specific goals we want to achieve with this tiny house build, including LEED Certification. But to give you a better idea of what the end product will be like, we’re going to share some of the design requirements that the team will use to guide their work on the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>The tiny house should be as self-contained as possible, providing its own energy, water, and waste treatment/storage. Accomplished via the use of solar energy, rain water harvesting and storage, composting of organic wastes, etc.</li>
<li>These systems should be interactive, much as one might describe a solar energy system as grid-interactive. The idea is that when the owner chooses a long-term home for the unit, they can install extra storage on site for water, electricity, etc. The house must be able to take from these sources when required but to also feed into these sources when over-producing.</li>
<li>The tiny house should provide as many of the typical comforts of a home as possible.</li>
<li>The unit must be future ready so that it can be paired to an electrified tow vehicle, such as those under development by several companies.</li>
<li>It must be durable and resilient to withstand the stresses of frequent movement and a large variety of climatic conditions.</li>
<li>The structure should be within reasonable weight and size limitations to enable easier transportation without the requirement of special permits.</li>
<li>The design should focus on perfecting the envelop and mechanical systems of the house while allowing for flexibility in appearance and build-out so that it can be easily adapted for different circumstances, such as an increase in size, placement on a permanent foundation, and other changes.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>This is breakdown of all the costs associated with the successful campaign and tiny house build.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546726049/vvk3xt9jioe7pumlbrih.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You’ll notice that there are three sections we included in the budget that we valued at zero:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create Crowdfunding Campaign Promotional Videos</li>
<li>Getting the Word Out! (Running Ads)</li>
<li>Crowdfunding Campaign and Mailing List Management</li>
</ul>
<p>We wanted your campaign contribution to go directly to the tiny house, not the operating expenses of the project. So, we’re covering all the costs associated with these aspects of the campaign ourselves with a combination of investments of money from ourselves and our company, and a whole lot of unbilled labour hours working towards a successful campaign.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>We’re not asking you to fund any old ordinary tiny house build, because most tiny homes are built the same way that regular homes are built, and this typically leaves a lot to be desired. We want it to be extraordinary, and that means our costs are going to be higher than the typical design and build for a tiny house and in turn that we need to raise more money from more people to complete a successful campaign. So, our two big challenges in this regard is to reach a lot of people with the campaign and convince those people that this project is something worth funding.</p>
<p>Our last major challenge…can we actually do it? To ensure that we can meet our very ambitious goals we’ve assembled a team of industry experts from a variety of highly respected companies who’ve worked together before and completed many successful projects in the past that have reached these same high standards. Check out the Team Section to meet these individuals and companies and check out the links below to some of the projects they’ve worked on previously:</p>

<p>Finally, as discussed earlier, we are aiming to achieve LEED Certification for our tiny house. This is a hard-enough task in and of itself as not every building that works towards this designation achieves it. But to add to this difficulty the current LEED Rating system doesn’t recognize mobile structures such as the one we are planning. So, not only do we have to achieve enough credits in the rating system to get certified we also have to convince the certification body that our structure is worth recognizing and is in alignment with LEED’s end goal of reducing a building’s environmental impact.</p>
<p>Again, our team is essential in overcoming this challenge. We are designing this project as if we will be applying for LEED Certification whether we can do so in the end or not. No matter what, we’ll still have an extraordinary home. And with EcoAmmo on our side, a company extremely experienced with coordinating with Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI), we have a greatly improved chance of achieving this goal.</p>

</div></div>","The Campaign
We’re Ethan and Conner Borlé, brothers from Alberta, Canada. We started a small residential construction business together in 2014 that we named “Borlé Bros. Contracting Corp.” I know, creative right? 
We’re eager to start 2019 off with a bang and reach our goal of bringing healthier, durable, energy efficient, and AFFORDABLE homes to the average person.
We want to show you how a modern home can and should be built, so that together we can drive architects, designers, builders, governments and code regulation authorities to do more to ensure we all have better homes to live in.
And we’re going to start off by building a tiny house on wheels to one of the highest, most respected standards in the building industry. And then we’re going to give it away to one of our Indiegogo supporters!

We’re running an all-or-nothing campaign. That means, if we don’t reach our funding goal, we don’t take any of your money. Your credit card is only charged if we reach our target by our chosen end date. So, you don’t have to worry about winning a half completed tiny house that doesn’t live up to the hype. We only want to go forward with the project if we know we can do it right.
Continue reading to learn how you can support the campaign and win the tiny house for yourself. If you want to know even more visit our webpage (HERE) for loads of additional information!

Targeting LEED Certification

One of the central tenants of our project is to go way beyond what a code-built house is today.
We want to blow this standard out of the water so we’re targeting LEED Certification, a third-party verified building rating system. So, you’ll know it’s a scientifically verified, better building.
LEED, or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is the most used green building rating system in the world. LEED helps drive the creation of healthy, highly efficient and cost-saving structures through an adaptable credit system which spans an array of building related issues. To reach our goal of becoming LEED Certified we’ll be addressing such things as:
Water Efficiency
Energy & Atmosphere
Material & Resources
Indoor Environmental Quality
Innovation
If we are successful, we will have the first ever tiny house on wheels to achieve LEED Certification in the WORLD!

The Impact
The impact of our campaign might seem clear, one deserving individual is going to walk away with a fully functioning tiny house, and a stellar one at that!
But we hope the campaign has a farther reaching and longer lasting impact than that. You see, most of us are living in sub-optimal conditions and we don’t even know it! We’ve been in these conditions for so long we just don’t realize what are homes and workspaces are doing to us.

Feeling tired all the time? It could be because there is not enough ventilation in your home, leading to lower oxygen levels, or perhaps the lighting isn’t designed with your natural circadian rhythm in mind.
Contaminants in the air can make us fall ill more frequently, causing us to miss work and time with our families and friends.
 Productivity levels are lower in these poorly designed environments.
Buildings have a negative impact on the environment, not just when they are being built, but every day they operate afterwards.
Many of us experience chronic stress due to the never-ending mortgage payments, utility bills, and maintenance expenses that arise with home ownership.

We hope to show as many people as possible that they don’t have to put up with these typical symptoms of a “sick” building. And we want to help people get into these healthier buildings by making all our planning documents available at a fraction of their actual cost, literally less than 1% of what we’re paying for them! We’re also focusing on a smaller, more adaptable design to keep the build costs low and in recognition of the fact that more square footage does not equal more happiness.
The Team
We’ve teamed up with multiple companies and professionals in the field to make sure our design is the best it can be. 

 
 

Anthony G. Cameron | Architect, AAA, SAA, MRAIC, M.Arch., B.A.
Anthony, founder of Left Hand Architecture & Design Inc. will be bringing his creativity to our tiny house project. His responsibilities include the design of the building envelope, architectural details, and selection of materials and finishes to ensure we use sustainable products that will keep the occupants healthy. Anthony will be bringing not only his creative and collaborative approach to the team but also Passive House training through the Canadian Passive House Institute.

What We Need
This is breakdown of all the costs associated with the successful campaign and tiny house build.

You’ll notice that there are three sections we included in the budget that we valued at zero:

Create Crowdfunding Campaign Promotional Videos

No matter what, we’ll still have an extraordinary home. And with EcoAmmo on our side, a company extremely experienced with coordinating with Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI), we have a greatly improved chance of achieving this goal.

With the development of society, the security of luggage would be a problem that we needed to concern as it becomes essential.For this purpose, we designed I-Keeper to solve the safety issue.As tourism development growing over these years, people are traveling than ever before. When suitcases become indispensable, safety would be a problem that we needed to concern. Luggage is convenient but sometimes, it is not.  We may face many problems while traveling
I-Keeper is a vacuum suction device, the steel wire of it first hitch onto the luggage and then you can set up a password to lock the luggage. After that, the suction device will fix to the floor and connect with the luggage base on its vacuum principle. Besides, the I-Keeper attains 80 kg vacuum suction which is difficult to destroy by tools. Beginning in July 2019, We conducted a test by setting twenty I-Keeper in different locations, such as the shopping center, subway station, and Airbnb. Nevertheless, it was 100% secure as none of the products were destroyed. I-Keeper not only retains the benefit of traditional locker but also solves the shortcomings of it, including insufficient storage space and limit location.     Undeniably, the valuables inside of the luggage are costly. Through the development of luggage within different brands, it turns luggage from the necessity to luxury goods gradually. Therefore, we should not place luggage in public areas negligently as it is dangerous. Except for applying         I-Keeper in luggage protection, you can use it in the bicycle, stroller or pet as well.
I-Keeper is the first product that applies the combination lock into a vacuum suction device. We sincerely hope this product could bring peace and comfort to your life. I-Keeper adopts the vacuum principle to create a suction device which is a safe and stable technology through our testing. In New York, there is a man challenge to climb the building from the ground floor to the 58 floors using suction devices. Eventually, he succeeded in this challenge. This story told us this brave man trust the security of suction device as he risked life to do it.Moreover, the applications of suckers are extensive use in the industry. The breakthrough of the I-Keeperis applied the industrial sucker to create daily goods that bring convenience to people's lives.We think of creating a new business opportunity needs to solve the problem that is long-standing in society. When we come up with this idea, we realized that the circumstance of people placing luggage in public areas casually become severe. Below photos were shooting in different locations on the same day. We guarantee those photos are 100% real. As a result, the situation seems worse than we imagined and those photos tell us we should pay attention to keep luggage safe.Below is the overall crime ratio statistic of these cities  (count by per 100 000 population) 
Hong Kong - 827
Tokyo          - 1074
New York   - 2036
Paris           - 11983
London      - 8932
Toronto      - 4331
 
On-The-Go  Protection 
Non-exposed sucker, which increases its durability.
Structure assembly – able to replace the components of product
Stretched steel wire
 Easy to use-only 3 steps1. Press the button to pull out the steel wire depends on your luggage size. 2. Press another button to pull up the handle after fixing I-Keeper on the floor or any smooth surface.3. Press the handle to lock the vacuum sucker to complete the whole procedure.I-Keeper is appropriate for indoor or outdoor use. For example, you can use this product to prevent strangers open the door when staying at a hotel. Some thieves may know well to the hotel door locks and know how to unlock it. Therefore, you should adopt measures against theft to keep your safety.I-Keeper changes the weaknesses of the traditional locker. With no restrict storage location, you can enjoy the day with no barriers. The breakthrough point of this product applies the technique of vacuum suction to the anti-theft device. As long as using the vacuum suction device properly, the protective effect would more powerful than using other locks.We had to go through a lengthy design process, try various materials, and perform numerous tests.The first time we held the product in our hands we knew it was different, we just feel it is perfect, the quality, the right weight, the sleek design and the sense of security. FORSETI is a new brand for designing luggage and related protective devices. As far as we know, the problem of luggage security is considered as a concern by people all the time. Therefore, we decided to solve this problem which is why our brand start. We hope our product able to change people's lives for the better and break the boundaries. We have designed, improved and tested countless times until created ''I-Keeper'', an innovative protective product.Travel has become a way of life that turns luggage into a necessity in people's minds. Therefore, we believe that the I-Keeper will popularize from now on or even spanning the world. All of you are the members of the team and bringing power to us. Thank you for your support. We already applied for patent protection to the I-Keeper.Risks and challengesI-Keeper is the result of a year of the project. During the period of research, we’ve had issues with the design of the product. As we have to ensure every customer feels safe when using our product, it was very important to have a sturdy design. For this reason, we have to work with a lock manufacturer to investigate which structure along with materials could maximize the effectiveness of the I-Keeper. After the product design is performed, we have tested countless times until it attains our expectations. Another challenge we faced is finding the appropriate manufactory to produce the product due to I-Keeper is an innovative product that you’ve never heard. For that, we did a lot of research as well as communicated with different manufacturers. Now, we are ready to get the ball rolling. This is our first Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, we need your support to launch this safe, convenience and innovative safety device. Sometimes unforeseen barriers may appear, like shipping delays or production delays. However, we will pull out all the stops to minimize those possible risks.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

You simply open the kit, pop out the pieces, put them together, and fish! Kids love ‘em--- adults love ‘em--- but most importantly, FISH love ‘em!The designs of the Streamer Series of lures is based on well-known streamer fly patterns:The Worry Wort (Warden’s Worry)Your Sharona (Miss Sharon)The Mick Pocket (Mickey Finn)Casper’s Beard (Grey Ghost)Ken’s Winnebago (Kennebago Smelt)The Boss Man (Supervisor)Spectre Noir (Black Ghost)Mini Mud (Muddler Minnow)The Hobbit’s Foot (Matuka)Last April, we had a booth at the Maine Sportsman trade show, and had nearly 200 kids stop by to build a free lure! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95_Sbfx1dZYLaz’R Lure’s unique body shape makes them suitable for many different types of fishing action, including spin fishing, fly fishing, trolling, twitching retrieves, erratic crankbait movements, and strike-inducing spinning.Over the course of testing, we’ve caught large and smallmouth bass, rainbow, brown and brook trout, perch, pickerel, pike, and crappie!Laz’r Lure was created and developed by Richard deCosta, a registered Maine guide with nearly 40 years of experience in fishing, fly tying, and lure building. Our laser team, headed by Len Ludnum, has over 16 years of laser-based production experience. Our lure design artist Edward Luterio is one of the best in the business, and is well-known not only for lure design, but for amazing nature art and murals. Our manufacturing process is so refined and efficient that our lure kits can be created at a fraction of the cost of traditional lures! Imagine, nine beautiful wooden fishing lures for less than $12!By following the instructions included in each kit, or video instructions online, these lures can be put together in minutes and fished IMMEDIATELY. Because they are built up from 9 layers of birch plywood the finished lures are TOUGH. By adding a coat or two of epoxy sealer you can be sure they will last for MANY fishing seasons to come.Laz'R Lures can be fished in many ways.

<li>
<strong>Weight factors:</strong> Lights are one important EDC tool that you’ll never want to skimp on.</li>
<li>
<strong>Power Outages: </strong>A dark elevator, a movie theater or just about any typical daily-life situation. Even the smallest lights can be a major help in a power outage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tasks in the dark: </strong>Breaking down on a dark highway in the middle of nowhere, or trying to fix something underneath your car even in broad daylight can be a hassle without a light of some sorts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Identifying dangers </strong>: If you’re ever left in the dark, for any reason, you can shine your light into dark, murky areas, dark corners and dark approaches.</li>
<li>
<strong>Excellent : </strong>You’re left in the dark and better be darn sure to have a light source in your pocket. Carrying your EDC light can make a world of difference when depending on light to guide your way through a variety of situations.</li>

<strong>Peace of Mind:</strong> Lastly, a light source provides you with peace of mind. Knowing that you’ll have a reliable light source in your pocket.</li>

Convenience: A light is useless if it's a hassle to carry every day.

Ease of use:  What's important is that your light should functions as easily as possible to you.

Weight factors: Lights are one important EDC tool that you’ll never want to skimp on.

Power Outages: A dark elevator, a movie theater or just about any typical daily-life situation. Even the smallest lights can be a major help in a power outage.

Tasks in the dark: Breaking down on a dark highway in the middle of nowhere, or trying to fix something underneath your car even in broad daylight can be a hassle without a light of some sorts.

Identifying dangers : If you’re ever left in the dark, for any reason, you can shine your light into dark, murky areas, dark corners and dark approaches.

Excellent : You’re left in the dark and better be darn sure to have a light source in your pocket. Carrying your EDC light can make a world of difference when depending on light to guide your way through a variety of situations.

Peace of Mind: Lastly, a light source provides you with peace of mind. Knowing that you’ll have a reliable light source in your pocket.
It’s very important to have compact size, hassle free light source so everyone feel safe and secure every night.Qto-X uses Origional CREE, XP-G2 LED which delivers up to 20% more lumens per watt. Combining high light output, reliability and efficacy, XP-G2 is optimized for directional, high-lumen applications, from indoor and outdoor activities. Hard anodized coatings provide specific advantages on aluminium used for engineering components, with the properties of light weight and ease of machining plus a hard surface. ""Why should I carry an extra light when my phone has one?""this is by far the most common question we get from people.

It is not unusual for us to find out that bringing GPS, walkie talkie, camera, video camera and all other necessary electronic devices become a real burden. Also, under extreme environment such us -22 ℉ in snow mountain or 140 ℉ in desert, the stability of all these devices become a real challenge.With two years hard work and all our passion, SHOWPRO team devotes to provide outdoor activity enthusiasts the world’s first multifunctional Hybrid DMR (Digital Mobile Radio) Walkie Talkie Camcorder in high performance. The whole process was very challenging in both design and the technology development. But we made it.

Most of the functions are actually very suitable for use in the field of security.   We started the idea of SHOWPRO and developed the first version in 2015, through decent amount of tests we eventually have it in real with even more amazing features:  1.

<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>   Traveling is great and fun but it can cause a strain on your neck that can be very painful, caused from car seats to plane seats that do not take your neck into consideration. That’s why the extra cushioning of travel neck pillows is a warm welcome. Travel neck pillows is important for every time you spend propped up on a chair for long hours or just needed to rest your head for a quick nap. Perfect not just when you travel, as office chairs aren't kind to your neck and lower back either. Incorporating neck pillows into working hours gives your neck a little more love than you normally do and can save from unnecessary pain or doctor's bills. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The GERRY RIG:</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Simply Twist, Pull, and Place®</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I developed The Gerry Rig while showering in a federal prison in Texas. When I realized the universal appeal for such an invention, I contacted INVENTHELP for help in making this idea into a real-life product. After enlisting the help of my fellow inmates, we designed a product that would not only meet our needs, while incarcerated but also be of use to the millions of people who find themselves navigating cramped shower spaces. That is college students, military personnel, tiny house and RV owners, business travelers, gym-goers, so forth and so on. The list is quite long. There is definitely a need for The Gerry Rig, a device used to help promote the organization, protection, and accessibility of various personal items and showering necessities in particulary small shower stalls.</p>
<p>Specifically, while incarcerated, I found that the confined shower stall left me with no room to store personal items and toiletries in a convenient and easily accessible manner. Making efficient use of the limited space within the small shower areas, my invention would fulfill the need for a means of storing, protecting, and organizing a wide range of personal care items and other accessories so that they would be within easy reach while showering in a particularly small or confined shower space.</p>
<p>The appealing features of The Gerry Rig would be its novelty, portability, space-savings, convenience, compact design, and ease of use and installation. The Gerry Rig could be easily transported to a shower stall, where it could be suspended from a shower rod, article of clothing, or possibly mounted to the shower stall via suction cups.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What's Needed:</strong></p>
<p>The amount of funding I need is <strong>$25,000</strong>.</p>
<p>This money will be used toward the purchase of the <strong>Premium Package</strong> offered by <i>InventHelp</i>. We have already created a marketing plan, a preliminary patent search, and have a patent pending on my invention.</p>
<p>InventHelp, for $16,900, will create the following, and more, for my invention. For instance (this isn't an exhaustive listing):</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation of color New Product Submission Brochure that includes a 3D graphics illustration;</li>
<li>InventHelp Data Bank: Attempt to match invention with company stated areas of interest. Submission of New Product Submission Brochure to companies in the InventHelp Data Bank. (Companies that would potentially market and manufacture invention.)</li>

</div></div>","The GERRY RIG:
Simply Twist, Pull, and Place®
 
I developed The Gerry Rig while showering in a federal prison in Texas. When I realized the universal appeal for such an invention, I contacted INVENTHELP for help in making this idea into a real-life product. After enlisting the help of my fellow inmates, we designed a product that would not only meet our needs, while incarcerated but also be of use to the millions of people who find themselves navigating cramped shower spaces. That is college students, military personnel, tiny house and RV owners, business travelers, gym-goers, so forth and so on. The list is quite long. There is definitely a need for The Gerry Rig, a device used to help promote the organization, protection, and accessibility of various personal items and showering necessities in particulary small shower stalls.
Specifically, while incarcerated, I found that the confined shower stall left me with no room to store personal items and toiletries in a convenient and easily accessible manner. Making efficient use of the limited space within the small shower areas, my invention would fulfill the need for a means of storing, protecting, and organizing a wide range of personal care items and other accessories so that they would be within easy reach while showering in a particularly small or confined shower space.
The appealing features of The Gerry Rig would be its novelty, portability, space-savings, convenience, compact design, and ease of use and installation. The Gerry Rig could be easily transported to a shower stall, where it could be suspended from a shower rod, article of clothing, or possibly mounted to the shower stall via suction cups.
 
What's Needed:
The amount of funding I need is $25,000.
This money will be used toward the purchase of the Premium Package offered by InventHelp. We have already created a marketing plan, a preliminary patent search, and have a patent pending on my invention.
InventHelp, for $16,900, will create the following, and more, for my invention. For instance (this isn't an exhaustive listing):

Preparation of color New Product Submission Brochure that includes a 3D graphics illustration;
InventHelp Data Bank: Attempt to match invention with company stated areas of interest. Submission of New Product Submission Brochure to companies in the InventHelp Data Bank. (Companies that would potentially market and manufacture invention.)
Preparation of Press Release and posting to an online publicity distribution service.
Inclusion of my invention information in the InventHelp VirtualTrade Show and in the Virtual Invention Browsing Experience (VIBE).
Preparation of a Virtual Invention Presentation (VIP), a video containing 3D renderings and the computer generated animation highlighting the main function and use of my invention. 
Prototype model: Preparation of the computer aided drawings (CAD) of invention and creation of one prototype model, in white ABS plastic.
The remaining funds will go towards incorporating a Limited Liability Company (LLC), developing video and print marketing tools, and developing a professional logo and product packaging.

With your minimum donation of $10, you will be one of the first to receive a finished GERRY RIG for your own enhanced shower experience. 
If I do not achieve the funding goal as hoped, I will donate the funds to REACHING OUT FROM WITHIN, www.rofw.org and THE EAST HILL SINGERS (Arts in prison) www.artsinprison.org/the-choir.

<p>Imagine you have a car accident, or your car breaks down while driving. Unfortunately, it can happen to anyone at anytime on the road.</p>
<p>In the case of an accident you are likely to be in a state of shock and confusion, nervously trying to figure our what to do next.</p>
<p>You have to act IMMEDIATELY - secure yourself and everyone else around you by placing a warning triangle to warn others of the crash ahead.</p>
<p>Now try to build the warning triangle quickly and correctly in your shocked state!  Chances are you are going to have a hard time.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For over half a century we have used the same kind of warning triangle. Since then, numerous safety and functional improvements have been developed for cars. However, the warning triangle has remained the same - a flimsy design that people struggle with.</p>

<p><strong>SAFETREE®</strong> is the solution to this problem. An automatic deployable warning triangle ready to use with a simple flick of the wrist.</p>

<p><strong>The SAFETREE®</strong> warning triangle is the simple and practical solution to this problem.</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Imagine you have a car accident, or your car breaks down while driving. Unfortunately, it can happen to anyone at anytime on the road.
In the case of an accident you are likely to be in a state of shock and confusion, nervously trying to figure our what to do next.
You have to act IMMEDIATELY - secure yourself and everyone else around you by placing a warning triangle to warn others of the crash ahead.
Now try to build the warning triangle quickly and correctly in your shocked state!  Chances are you are going to have a hard time.   
 
For over half a century we have used the same kind of warning triangle. Since then, numerous safety and functional improvements have been developed for cars. However, the warning triangle has remained the same - a flimsy design that people struggle with.

 
SAFETREE® is the solution to this problem. An automatic deployable warning triangle ready to use with a simple flick of the wrist.
 
                               

Stored in a practical SmartBag, the SAFETREE® is ready to be immediately used in any emergency situation. Secure an accident site or warn others of a breakdown ahead without wasting valuable time.
Our SAFETREE® is QUICKER, EASIER AND MORE VISIBLE compared to a standard warning triangle. Integrated LED lights improve visibility for both day and night, allowing other drivers to spot you sooner. With the simple push of a button, the hazard and signal lights switch on.

 
SAFETREE® is the additional guardian angel that can be used in a wide variety of areas:



● We have designed SAFETREE® so that it can be quickly and easily stowed in any trunk using a practical SmartBAG.
● The core of the SAFETREE® is made of sturdy steel and aluminum to keep the structure stable and give it the ability to withstand strong wind.
● The fabric is made of reflective polyester fibers, and is waterproof. Sizes and colors are aligned with safety standards. 
● The LED lights are waterproof as well. Both the flashlight and the LED of the body are powered by AA batteries. We have included a storage space for emergency batteries in the SmartBAG.

<p><strong>Us</strong></p>
<p>We are a husband, wife and foster fail family who have been traveling the globe for the past 6 years capturing the beauty of the world through photos and videos. We traveled in search of adventure. In search of culture and animals. In search of beauty, luxury and love. And in search of food. Lots of food. But no matter where we went, every hotel we stayed in compromised our values in some way. We were desperate for somewhere we could happily give our money to. </p>
<p>We are both long term vegans for the animals, for the environment and for our health. We are environmentalists who are passionate about sustainable living. And we are animals lovers who ache to help strays and injured animals more than we are currently capable. </p>
<p>So at the beginning of 2018 we quit doing what we love; taking photos, capturing the world and exploring, so we could create<i> </i>something important, something essential and a <i>place</i> that we love. And so, PlantLife was born.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is so incredibly important because the travel industry is not keeping up. We need to take steps to make EVERYTHING about our world more sustainable and more compassionate.</p>
<p>By backing PlantLife you will be helping us, to not only build the very first hotel of its kind, but you will also be demonstrating to the world and the travel industry that truly responsible, sustainable and compassionate travel <i>is</i> possible without having to stay in a straw eco-lodge without electricity. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Where</strong></p>
<p>Cloaked in the disguise of a seemingly secluded oasis, miles from civilisation, PlantLife will, in fact, be conveniently located on the west side of Thailand's vegan paradise island of Koh Phangan. We will be near the village of Srithanu, Zen beach, Hin Kong and a short distance from Koh Phangan's main pier. This beautiful island already has a huge amount of vegan restaurants and eateries to cater for the existing eco-conscious and compassionate community.  </p>
<p>At the foot of a mountain and surrounded by national park, our luxury paradise location will provide breathtaking scenery in every direction. Nestled under tall coconut palms, among an abundance of native fruit trees and flower bushes, PlantLife will be the perfect setting for a tranquil and secluded luxury experience.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There’s no doubt this is a HUGE project, and it’s the largest crowd funding campaign for a hotel, EVER. We’re asking for your support to raise a whopping $870,000 - It’s a whole lot of money so we need a whole lot of people to get involved. </p>
<p>PlantLife is a collaborative project that we have been developing for just over a year. This means that instead of VC’s providing a capital injection, we’re essentially sharing the company between a few invested parties.</p>
<p>Our collaborative structure means we’ve managed to reduce our initial startup costs by a whole bunch, as well as introducing new and exciting collaborative ideas by some pretty passionate people. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552537238/bfevfoulgjskos55okwv.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Where the money will be going</strong></p>
<p><strong>​</strong>So you're probably thinking, so what do you need us for?... Well there are a lot of other expenses that we will need to cover in order to get PlantLife off the ground.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/2zZLiFBnVoLIWA8ksv/giphy.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>What if we do not meet our target?</strong></p>
<p>If we do not meet our target before the campaign ends, unfortunately, the campaign will be cancelled, you will all be refunded and we will have to attack this mountain from a different angle. Because we need so many people to be involved in this campaign, it means that you’ve got to share the hell out of this link! - otherwise it will take much, much longer to complete the project. We are determined and tenacious. We know there may be bumps and hurdles along the way, but we are confident that PlantLife will become a reality.</p>
<p><strong>What if we get overfunded?</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Overfunding opens us up to the possibility of increasing our current land-plot size, which will allow us to build more villas. Any extra money that we raise will also give us a little extra padding to fall back on, which would be incredibly helpful as a new company. </span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Think about the last time you went to a luxury hotel... or any hotel for that matter. Think about all the tiny details that you may not have noticed at the time. The plastic use, energy use, food wastage or even the type of food served at the hotel. Every tiny detail, even down to the impact that hotel has on its local community adds up. From a lot of seemingly small decisions that that hotel has made somewhere down the line, one big impact and footprint is created. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Animal Residents Care</h3>
<p><strong>(A long but necessary explanation!)</strong></p>
<p>ALL of our animal residents will be neutered, spayed &amp; vaccinated with no exceptions. </p>
<p>Donations are often the only way shelters &amp; sanctuaries survive. This means that, unfortunately, many of these shelters are so underfunded that the animals end up living in cramped and miserable conditions. We have seen this first hand and it is very sad to see. Although these animals are better off in these shelters with the medical care that they need, they are often still cooped up. </p>
<p>We have met and spoken to animal shelters and rescuers on Koh Phangan in regards to adopting animals who are most in need of a home; think of us as a halfway home for animals that are recovered, vaccinated, neutered/spayed and awaiting their forever home! All of these animals will be adoptable if guests take a shine to them. We will facilitate this with the help of animal shelters and relocators here in Thailand. This will enable us to keep adopting animals. </p>
<p>We will have a full-time, animal carer on-site, dedicated to ensuring that the animals are well looked after. We will also have an animal safe zone on the premises with a quarantine zone (similar to a small veterinary surgery) and emergency medical supplies and vaccinations. We will be partnering with local vets to give our animals routine check ups and vaccinations on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Unlike most sanctuaries with limited space and resources, our animals will be free to roam the 19,200 sqm area; we have nooks, hideaways and shrouded areas for them to explore and play. PlantLife will be surrounded by a very tall and cat-proof perimeter wall, to ensure that the animals are kept safe and sound on our premises, and to ensure that no potentially sick animals can wander on site before they have been treated and vaccinated.</p>
<p>We know that cats are natural hunters and we will be taking all the steps we can, to make sure this does not impact our natural wildlife. All cats will wear bell collars to minimise any unfortunate incidents. We will also be taking all the measures possible to keep any potentially dangerous critters such as snakes off the premises and away from our guests and animal residents. </p>
<p>We believe it is important for our guests to understand why we do what we do, and to remember that we are not a petting zoo, or a place where the animals serve as entertainment for us. We will provide our guests with information and education on the plight of feral &amp; free-roaming animals &amp; their affect on wildlife.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<p><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Cat Food</strong></p>
<p>Although we aim to be 100% vegan in every aspect of our hotel operations, cat food will be one area in which we will not be able to be totally vegan, for fear of compromising our cats’ health. Dogs can be fed a plant based diet and are not obligate carnivores. They can, and do, thrive on a properly formulated vegan diet including foods like rice, sweet potatoes, carrots, lentils and other plant-based foods. In fact, one of the longest lifetime lengths recorded for a dog is 27 years or 189 years in dog years, was from a dog named Bramble who was vegan and her story is quite famous!</p>
<p>Cats, however, are hyper carnivorous (or obligate carnivores) and require taurine found in meat to keep them healthy. In an ideal scenario, animals would catch their own food, and would not be contributing to the environmental and ethical factors that cause concern in animal agriculture, but sadly, domesticated animals like cats, are dependant on us for everything that is important in their lives, including food. Unfortunately, this means we would need to provide our cats with a source of animal based protein to keep them healthy. The small consolation we take here, is in the fact that most cat and dog foods do not come from animals being slaughtered to feed cats and dogs, but rather from by-products from animals being killed to feed people (i.e. made from animal proteins which are not allowed to be sold as human ‘food’). </p>
<p>We know that vegan cat foods are being developed, but we don't believe that there is one on the market at this time has been proven to keep cats healthy and happy. If an option like this does become available we will be open to considering it, if it is locally available and proven (without doubt) to be sufficient for cat's health.</p>
<p>This is something that we’ve tackled with personally and as a business. The issue is, PlantLife will be situated on an island in the gulf of Thailand, Koh Phangan - being able to ship potentially viable vegan cat food hundreds of miles across multiple transportation is not sustainable. Currently, the closest supplier is Singapore, but the product testing and customer feedback that we’ve read through extensively, doesn’t make this a product that we would be happy to feed our animals.</p>

<p>... You’re welcomed by a warm and friendly team and handed a chilled lemongrass tea and a fragrant warm towel to refresh you after your long journey.</p>
<p>... Imagine the sweet smell of jasmine and orchids whilst you enjoy the plush, authentic and traditional surroundings. You notice the low hum of a therapeutic pur radiating from a small, furry cat curled up on a colourful woven cushion beside you; greeting you like an old friend into their safe haven. Imagine walking the path through the abundant and vibrant hotel grounds, you approach your villa and pluck a fresh and juicy rose apple from a tree at your doorstep. You enter what will be your home for the next few days and notice the soaps, the lotions, the furnishings, even the dressing gowns and beach bags in your room are ethical and vegan. You enjoy the cool air; a welcome refuge from the warm morning sun. Imagine knowing that you can enjoy the refreshing, cool air and warm water from a rainfall shower worry-free, because this hotel runs entirely on solar energy and renewable water sources.</p>
<p>... Imagine wandering to the restaurant with a rumbling tummy, knowing that whatever you order will be completely guilt-free in more ways than one; nutritious, delicious and cruelty-free. You wander through lush palm and fruit trees and spy a fluffy clowder of kittens warming themselves in a patch of sun under a flowering banana tree.</p>
<p>...Imagine being accompanied to the hidden botanical library cafe by a wise &amp; peaceful soi dog, after enjoying a refreshing dip in the luxurious, chemical-free swimming pool.</p>
<p>... Imagine sinking into your soft bed after an evening under the stars and fairy lights, watching your favourite movie in the company of kind, like-minded people and PlantLife’s furry residents. You relax further into your bed and think about your long day exploring this heaven that you have been excited about for so long.</p>
<p>... Imagine just before you close your eyes to rest, you look across the room and see a small bundle curled up in a Thai wicker basket; your new friend on your first day at PlantLife.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>
<strong>What happens if we don't reach our target?</strong> Rest assured, if we don't reach our target your money will be refunded. If this happens, then sure, that would suck, BUT it wouldn't necessarily be the end of PlantLife... The more you share this video and campaign and the more we can show some tangible numbers demonstrating how interested we <i>know </i>you guys will be in a hotel like this, then the easier it will be for us to attain funding from other sources such as VCs if necessary. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<b>Implementing solar power will be difficult won't it?</b> To properly implement solar panels in the most effective way, it is a great idea to integrate them into the build rather than add them later, which is what we are doing. However, not all construction companies know how to do this effectively. This is why we have Phangan Solar on board to help advise us on things such as effective insulation, which will help us down the line to ensure we do not waste any power and how to properly integrate the solar panels into the hotel build. The electricity grid on Koh Phangan is pretty temperamental, so solar will be quite a reliable power source in comparison, considering the consistency of sunny days in Thailand. We will also have batteries to store solar power for use throughout the night. However, in the unlikely scenario that the batteries run out, we will have back up power. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Isn't Koh Phangan a party island? </strong>Yes and No.<strong> </strong>Koh Phangan was first inhabited by Monks who were impressed by the island's spiritual energy. This sparked the beginning of the spiritual community who live by kind and gentle practices such as ahimsa, which is the concept of non-violence towards other humans, animals and the land. This community is now predominantly on the West side of the island where many vegan cafes and yoga retreats are situated (and where PlantLife will be built). This community began the respectful, spiritual and ceremonial celebration of the full moon on Koh Phangan. In recent years, however, Full Moon Parties have been come to be known as something very different. These parties mostly take place on the South East of the island in Haad Rin. Although this presents itself as a threat, and despite, unfortunately, being disruptive to the South East of the island, these parties are not a threat to the peaceful West side of the island. Koh Phangan has its own strict zoning system in place to protect the island and ensure these party areas do not grow. In fact, the disruptive nature of these parties is actually prompting the Thai authorities to implement more and more measures to help conserve the environment and communities on Koh Phangan and have, for example, recently banned ‘unfriendly activities’, such as fishing, fish feeding, anchoring on coral reefs, construction on the beach, and walking on the seabed on the islands (implemented in July 2018). So yes, there are full moon parties on Koh Phangan (on the other side of the island), but we are confident that, as travellers are becoming more conscious and authorities are becoming stricter with disruptive tourism, that these parties will become less and less over time, leaving Koh Phangan a relatively untouched, unspoilt and quiet island with many eco practices. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Why is the resort not on the beach? </strong>We believe being situated a short distance from the beach will allow us to achieve a secluded paradise oasis. The majority of beach areas have at least some population, therefore factors such as noise pollution, potential litter, already occupied beaches and music from restaurants and hotels will be totally out of our control in these areas. This secluded piece of land gives us an opportunity to create a completely peaceful, spacious and secluded environment. But, don't worry! We know that a holiday isn't a holiday without the ocean, so we will be providing free shuttles (7 minute ride) to Srithanu beach (aka Zen beach) 3-4 times daily and bicycle hire will be available if you would rather a short cycle.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>But you don't have experience in building hotels... </strong> It is true that neither of us have experience in building or managing a hotel. However, our travels have given us extensive and valuable insight into what makes a memorable and remarkable hotel. We know that we are <i>exactly</i> our target audience, which puts us in the unique position of knowing exactly what our guests want. Many hotel operators or developers do not have this insight; we believe this is why many hotels fail to be personable, responsible and memorable. However, we know that there are many inner workings of a hotel build and operation that we will need help with. This is why we are hiring a strong and passionate team to help us develop, build &amp; operate PlantLife.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>What if I don't like animals? </strong>The emphasis at PlantLife will be that our guests are never forced to interact with the animals, if they do not choose to, and vice versa. The smart architecture of the whole resort will be designed around the animals. The animals will have nooks, hideaways and beds all over the resort, so guests can choose to interact with the animals when and if they like. We will also have an ‘animal &amp; guest lounge area’, where both animals and guests can relax together on hammocks, daybeds and furnishings if they want to. The interior will be carefully designed to create a luxury, cohabit space for both guests and resident animals. The guests will not be obliged to, but will have the option to invite the animals into their rooms during the day or night to enjoy the space together. Villas will utilize smart architecture to integrate the animals and facilitate guest interaction. The animals will not be trapped in any place where they are forced to interact (like many cat cafes), so there is no forced interaction both ways.  </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>But I'm not vegan... </strong>Don't worry, our menu has so much variety and lots of plant based meat, so you won't even know the difference; you might even feel healthier by the end of your stay, which is an unusual bonus at the end of a luxury holiday!   </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>What if Im allergic to cats or dogs?! </strong>Fear not! 2 of our villas will be designated for guests with dander allergies. They will be dander free zones!</li></ul>

Us
We are a husband, wife and foster fail family who have been traveling the globe for the past 6 years capturing the beauty of the world through photos and videos. We traveled in search of adventure. In search of culture and animals. In search of beauty, luxury and love. And in search of food. Lots of food. But no matter where we went, every hotel we stayed in compromised our values in some way. We were desperate for somewhere we could happily give our money to. 
We are both long term vegans for the animals, for the environment and for our health. We are environmentalists who are passionate about sustainable living. And we are animals lovers who ache to help strays and injured animals more than we are currently capable. 
So at the beginning of 2018 we quit doing what we love; taking photos, capturing the world and exploring, so we could create something important, something essential and a place that we love. And so, PlantLife was born.
Why
This campaign is so incredibly important because the travel industry is not keeping up. We need to take steps to make EVERYTHING about our world more sustainable and more compassionate.
By backing PlantLife you will be helping us, to not only build the very first hotel of its kind, but you will also be demonstrating to the world and the travel industry that truly responsible, sustainable and compassionate travel is possible without having to stay in a straw eco-lodge without electricity. 





 
Where
Cloaked in the disguise of a seemingly secluded oasis, miles from civilisation, PlantLife will, in fact, be conveniently located on the west side of Thailand's vegan paradise island of Koh Phangan. We will be near the village of Srithanu, Zen beach, Hin Kong and a short distance from Koh Phangan's main pier. This beautiful island already has a huge amount of vegan restaurants and eateries to cater for the existing eco-conscious and compassionate community.  
At the foot of a mountain and surrounded by national park, our luxury paradise location will provide breathtaking scenery in every direction. Nestled under tall coconut palms, among an abundance of native fruit trees and flower bushes, PlantLife will be the perfect setting for a tranquil and secluded luxury experience.
 
What We Need & What You Get
There’s no doubt this is a HUGE project, and it’s the largest crowd funding campaign for a hotel, EVER. We’re asking for your support to raise a whopping $870,000 - It’s a whole lot of money so we need a whole lot of people to get involved. 
PlantLife is a collaborative project that we have been developing for just over a year. This means that instead of VC’s providing a capital injection, we’re essentially sharing the company between a few invested parties.
Our collaborative structure means we’ve managed to reduce our initial startup costs by a whole bunch, as well as introducing new and exciting collaborative ideas by some pretty passionate people. 


Where the money will be going
​So you're probably thinking, so what do you need us for?... Well there are a lot of other expenses that we will need to cover in order to get PlantLife off the ground.
 
What if we do not meet our target?
If we do not meet our target before the campaign ends, unfortunately, the campaign will be cancelled, you will all be refunded and we will have to attack this mountain from a different angle. Because we need so many people to be involved in this campaign, it means that you’ve got to share the hell out of this link! - otherwise it will take much, much longer to complete the project. We are determined and tenacious. We know there may be bumps and hurdles along the way, but we are confident that PlantLife will become a reality.
What if we get overfunded?
Overfunding opens us up to the possibility of increasing our current land-plot size, which will allow us to build more villas. Any extra money that we raise will also give us a little extra padding to fall back on, which would be incredibly helpful as a new company.

Our Partners 
PlantLife will be a collaborative project; this means that instead of VC’s providing a capital injection, we’re essentially sharing the company between a few invested parties. Our collaborative structure means we’ve managed to reduce our initial startup costs by a whole bunch, as well as introducing new and exciting collaborative ideas by some pretty passionate people.
The invested collaborators will be as follows:
         - A Thai construction company with knowledge on how to implement eco and solar practices into the build.
         - A Thai architect experienced in designing eco conscious and sustainable buildings.
         - The land owner.  
And our on board consultants will help us ensure that we are as eco friendly and solar efficient as possible.      

 
The Impact
Think about the last time you went to a luxury hotel... or any hotel for that matter. Think about all the tiny details that you may not have noticed at the time. The plastic use, energy use, food wastage or even the type of food served at the hotel. Every tiny detail, even down to the impact that hotel has on its local community adds up. From a lot of seemingly small decisions that that hotel has made somewhere down the line, one big impact and footprint is created. 



 
Experiences
We are focused on offering our guests authentic travel experiences that enrich our local community and give our guests memorable travel experiences. All of PlantLife's experiences are centred around Thai culture, our local community, sustainable living, animal welfare and the plant based lifestyle. For our full list of experiences, head over to our website. 
https://www.plantlifehotel.com/experience 




 
Restaurant 
PlantLife restaurant will be a luxury, plant based dining experience. Our extensive menu boasts healthy and delicious dishes created with fresh, seasonal and local ingredients. We will tailor our menu for each season. 
Check out our full menu at our website address below:
www.plantlifehotel.com/restaurant
But here are a few pages for a taster...



 
Animal Residents Care
(A long but necessary explanation!)
ALL of our animal residents will be neutered, spayed & vaccinated with no exceptions. 
Donations are often the only way shelters & sanctuaries survive. This means that, unfortunately, many of these shelters are so underfunded that the animals end up living in cramped and miserable conditions. We have seen this first hand and it is very sad to see. Although these animals are better off in these shelters with the medical care that they need, they are often still cooped up. 
We have met and spoken to animal shelters and rescuers on Koh Phangan in regards to adopting animals who are most in need of a home; think of us as a halfway home for animals that are recovered, vaccinated, neutered/spayed and awaiting their forever home! All of these animals will be adoptable if guests take a shine to them. We will facilitate this with the help of animal shelters and relocators here in Thailand. This will enable us to keep adopting animals. 
We will have a full-time, animal carer on-site, dedicated to ensuring that the animals are well looked after. We will also have an animal safe zone on the premises with a quarantine zone (similar to a small veterinary surgery) and emergency medical supplies and vaccinations. We will be partnering with local vets to give our animals routine check ups and vaccinations on a regular basis.
Unlike most sanctuaries with limited space and resources, our animals will be free to roam the 19,200 sqm area; we have nooks, hideaways and shrouded areas for them to explore and play. PlantLife will be surrounded by a very tall and cat-proof perimeter wall, to ensure that the animals are kept safe and sound on our premises, and to ensure that no potentially sick animals can wander on site before they have been treated and vaccinated.
We know that cats are natural hunters and we will be taking all the steps we can, to make sure this does not impact our natural wildlife. All cats will wear bell collars to minimise any unfortunate incidents. We will also be taking all the measures possible to keep any potentially dangerous critters such as snakes off the premises and away from our guests and animal residents. 
We believe it is important for our guests to understand why we do what we do, and to remember that we are not a petting zoo, or a place where the animals serve as entertainment for us. We will provide our guests with information and education on the plight of feral & free-roaming animals & their affect on wildlife.
 

Cat Food
Although we aim to be 100% vegan in every aspect of our hotel operations, cat food will be one area in which we will not be able to be totally vegan, for fear of compromising our cats’ health. Dogs can be fed a plant based diet and are not obligate carnivores. They can, and do, thrive on a properly formulated vegan diet including foods like rice, sweet potatoes, carrots, lentils and other plant-based foods. In fact, one of the longest lifetime lengths recorded for a dog is 27 years or 189 years in dog years, was from a dog named Bramble who was vegan and her story is quite famous!
Cats, however, are hyper carnivorous (or obligate carnivores) and require taurine found in meat to keep them healthy. In an ideal scenario, animals would catch their own food, and would not be contributing to the environmental and ethical factors that cause concern in animal agriculture, but sadly, domesticated animals like cats, are dependant on us for everything that is important in their lives, including food. Unfortunately, this means we would need to provide our cats with a source of animal based protein to keep them healthy. The small consolation we take here, is in the fact that most cat and dog foods do not come from animals being slaughtered to feed cats and dogs, but rather from by-products from animals being killed to feed people (i.e. made from animal proteins which are not allowed to be sold as human ‘food’). 
We know that vegan cat foods are being developed, but we don't believe that there is one on the market at this time has been proven to keep cats healthy and happy. If an option like this does become available we will be open to considering it, if it is locally available and proven (without doubt) to be sufficient for cat's health.
This is something that we’ve tackled with personally and as a business. The issue is, PlantLife will be situated on an island in the gulf of Thailand, Koh Phangan - being able to ship potentially viable vegan cat food hundreds of miles across multiple transportation is not sustainable. Currently, the closest supplier is Singapore, but the product testing and customer feedback that we’ve read through extensively, doesn’t make this a product that we would be happy to feed our animals.

<span>Second, choose from a range of accessories to give your drone a specific functionality; if you want a drone for photography, choose the gimbal, if you want it to carry something, add on our hook. These accessories are easily interchangeable. Eventually we hope to extend the amount of accessories available to our customers after our (hopefully!) successful IndieGoGo campaign. But, to give you an idea, the next potential things we have in mind are a FPV kit and arms kitted out with LED lights. The possibilities really are endless.</span><p></p>

<p></p>
<p>So how did it all happen? Well, just one year ago, a group of 
friends began to develop the idea of a personalized drone based on a DIY
 concept. It had to have great performance to compete with the 
industry’s finest, but it also needed to be easy to assemble and 
customizable. Over the following months, and with the help of advances 
in 3D printing, the Mosquito, our new DIY Drone, started to take shape.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457972859/iy4ubqngponxfo4xqz1v.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
BonaDrone consists of the following members:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Pep Martí Saumell:</b> Industrial engineer, 5 years of working experience as Industrial product designer. Passionate of 3D printing and its the multiple applications. Responsible of the design and the development of the Mosquito.
</li>
<li>
<b>Josep Tomàs Vergés:</b> Industrial engineer, 4 years working experience as project manager coordinating production, transport, assembly and commissioning. Starting flirting with drones 2 years ago. Responsible of the commercial and logistics issues.</li>
<li>
<b>Daniel López Hidalgo:</b> Informatic engineer, more than 6 years of experience in web &amp; software development.  Responsible of drone controller settings and intern software.</li>
<li>
<b>Alex Cazorla Solà:</b> Informatic engineer, more than 6 years of experience in web &amp; applications development. In charge of the website development and marketing.</li>
<li>
<b>Jordi Grau Boladeras:</b> Electronic assembly technician, more than 8 years working as electronic technician of petrol stations. In charge of the production and assembly process and the quality control.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span>The idea of BonaDrone was born at an airport in Germany, where Pep and Alex were visiting Josep, who was doing his Erasmus in Berlin. Later Dani and Jordi joined the team, and nowadays BonaDrone is a group effort between 5 childhood friends- each with expetise in either engineering or IT.</span></p>
<p>We are based in a small town near Barcelona, Spain. From there we have decided to start this exciting new project combining 3D printing and drones; two technologies that stand to revolutionize our daily lives in the coming years. </p>
<p>Our first step was to buy spare parts, assemble a drone and discover the electronic components required. With this first drone we started to understand how it worked and what was necessary to make it fly. Unfortunately the result was a drone that was pretty difficult to pilot and downright ugly. We named it “Frankenstein”. </p>After plenty of reflection and countless hours of investigation, we concluded that we were not the only ones who were trying to create our own drone from scratch. Instead we decided to use our skills and knowledge to start creating our first drone through 3D printing.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img alt=""BonaDrone team members"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455720425/yf2t227bntrzr9j2h1cw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The final product that you see above is the result of a long journey full of doubts, struggles and lessons learned. </span></p>
<p>And therein lies the real motivation behind this project. We want to offer a pack that can help anybody design, assemble and fly their very own drone - but with high performance at the first time of asking. We’ve experienced Frankenstein already, and nobody needs to go through that again. We have already been in the position of every ambitious user, and want to make the whole process way easier for those who decide to join this wonderful world of drones and 3D printing.</p>
<p>After implementing some modifications with our first prototype, we are proud to be left with the product which is the foundation of our idea, the “Mosquito”. From this basis, any user will be available to assemble a unique drone on our platform.</p>That is how the Mosquito and the idea of our DIY Drone project was born. Welcome to the BonaDrone philosophy.<p></p>

</div></div>","The wait is over. Drone lovers and tech enthusiasts now have the chance to personalize and assemble their very own 3D-printed, modular drone. The Mosquito, from BonaDrone, is an easy-to-fly and customizable smart quadcopter. It also happens to be the product of two of the most exciting innovations in technology right now: Drones and 3D Printing.
Our mission is simple. We want to give everyone the opportunity to design and build their own unqiue, 3D-printed drone through our platform. We’ve done the hard work, it’s down to you to decide what the final result will look like and your drone’s functionalities.While we are happy to send your final Mosquito fully set up and ready to fly, we encourage our users to receive their drones in pieces. We think this is a great way to give everyone the chance to learn about how drones work and discover the technology behind what we do. As well as being customizable and 3D-printed, the Mosquito also comes with a range of autonomous flight features and the promise that we will be there to guide you on your journey, every step of the way.
























The BonaDrone experience begins with a basic product, the “Mosquito”. From this platform you can personalize, assemble and take apart your drone. You can improve and upgrade it, or adapt it to perform a specific task to suit your needs and preferences. Design your drone in 3 easy steps:








First up you have to customize the appearance of the Mosquito. This involves selecting the colors for every part of the drone, including the logo on the top cover.  








Second, choose from a range of accessories to give your drone a specific functionality; if you want a drone for photography, choose the gimbal, if you want it to carry something, add on our hook. These accessories are easily interchangeable. Eventually we hope to extend the amount of accessories available to our customers after our (hopefully!) successful IndieGoGo campaign. But, to give you an idea, the next potential things we have in mind are a FPV kit and arms kitted out with LED lights. The possibilities really are endless.







Finally all of our users can decide if they want to improve the performance of their Mosquito drone. This can be done by replacing part of the frame with carbon fiber, upgrading the flight controller or upgrading from a 4 propeller drone (Quadcopter) to an 8 propeller drone (Octocopter). 









At BonaDrone, we will always be on hand to support our users, and care deeply about building the foundations for a strong community, not just a great drone. That is why all of our products will be delivered with a complete assembly and electronic connections manual. Moreover we have an address, support@bonadrone.com, and a skype channel, BonaDrone Support, which will offer useful resources and be clear points of contact. 







BonaDrone fuses two innovative and exciting technologies: drones and 3D printing. We want to spread the latest in innovation to as wide an audience as possible, and feel that the best way to do this is through our Mosquito drone. All in all we provide an immersive, enjoyable way for people to customize and build their very own drone, offering step by step guidance along the way. Anybody can follow our simple instructions, configure their own drone and, most importantly, fly!




We offer personalizations and improvements to push the limits of your creativity. We also encourage community members to suggest proposals and designs for future features and products. You can share your ideas with us at www.bonadrone.com/suggestion , and we will put the most popular into production after a vote from our users. 
Thanks to a system that allows users to assemble and disassemble accessories easily, any new ones we develop will be completely interchangeable. Exciting possibilities are opening up in front of us all the time, and we hope that the Mosquito drone will contribute greatly to the DIY drone community and grow alongside it.

So how did it all happen? Well, just one year ago, a group of 
friends began to develop the idea of a personalized drone based on a DIY
 concept. It had to have great performance to compete with the 
industry’s finest, but it also needed to be easy to assemble and 
customizable. Over the following months, and with the help of advances 
in 3D printing, the Mosquito, our new DIY Drone, started to take shape.





BonaDrone consists of the following members:



Pep Martí Saumell: Industrial engineer, 5 years of working experience as Industrial product designer. Passionate of 3D printing and its the multiple applications. Responsible of the design and the development of the Mosquito.


Josep Tomàs Vergés: Industrial engineer, 4 years working experience as project manager coordinating production, transport, assembly and commissioning. Starting flirting with drones 2 years ago. Responsible of the commercial and logistics issues.

Daniel López Hidalgo: Informatic engineer, more than 6 years of experience in web & software development.  Responsible of drone controller settings and intern software.

Alex Cazorla Solà: Informatic engineer, more than 6 years of experience in web & applications development. In charge of the website development and marketing.

Jordi Grau Boladeras: Electronic assembly technician, more than 8 years working as electronic technician of petrol stations. In charge of the production and assembly process and the quality control.


The idea of BonaDrone was born at an airport in Germany, where Pep and Alex were visiting Josep, who was doing his Erasmus in Berlin. Later Dani and Jordi joined the team, and nowadays BonaDrone is a group effort between 5 childhood friends- each with expetise in either engineering or IT.
We are based in a small town near Barcelona, Spain. From there we have decided to start this exciting new project combining 3D printing and drones; two technologies that stand to revolutionize our daily lives in the coming years. 
Our first step was to buy spare parts, assemble a drone and discover the electronic components required. With this first drone we started to understand how it worked and what was necessary to make it fly. Unfortunately the result was a drone that was pretty difficult to pilot and downright ugly. We named it “Frankenstein”. After plenty of reflection and countless hours of investigation, we concluded that we were not the only ones who were trying to create our own drone from scratch. Instead we decided to use our skills and knowledge to start creating our first drone through 3D printing.



The final product that you see above is the result of a long journey full of doubts, struggles and lessons learned. 
And therein lies the real motivation behind this project. We want to offer a pack that can help anybody design, assemble and fly their very own drone - but with high performance at the first time of asking. We’ve experienced Frankenstein already, and nobody needs to go through that again. We have already been in the position of every ambitious user, and want to make the whole process way easier for those who decide to join this wonderful world of drones and 3D printing.
After implementing some modifications with our first prototype, we are proud to be left with the product which is the foundation of our idea, the “Mosquito”. From this basis, any user will be available to assemble a unique drone on our platform.That is how the Mosquito and the idea of our DIY Drone project was born. Welcome to the BonaDrone philosophy.

































Since its creation, the Mosquito has been piloted by many different people, from children to teenagers, grandparents and even a helicopter pilot. Everybody has enjoyed discovering the latest trend in technology and witnessing what can be done with a 3D printer. As the “Mosquito” takes to the sky it lets the imagination fly too; just imagine all of the future possibilities!





If you like the world of technology, you will love the Mosquito. Our dream is to inspire people’s creativity and let our users influence the design by adapting and assembling the Mosquito. We want people to learn all about this new technology, and discover the endless possibilities of the drone revolution. 





Finally, we would like to thank you for taking the time to visit the BonaDrone’s project. We hope that you will back us and spread the word!











As with any  technological product with complex characteristics, there is a risk that users will struggle to piece things together. In order to avoid that, on top of our channels of support available, we have developed easy-to-use manuals, as well as tutorial videos that will be shared with our backers.

What we can say is that we are on target for the hub of a delta weight of 350 g (12.35 oz) over typical OEM hub (what you get on your new bike). For the air-reservoir on the rim, it’s ~200 g (7oz) more.</p><p>So, it’s heavier than your current hub… yet before you stop reading, just consider first that on a bike we are all first concerned about added weight because:</p><ol>
<li>It increases the amount of energy we need to put when pedaling.</li>
<li>It makes the wheel feel more sluggish due to increased moment of inertia.</li>
</ol><p>For 1, it doesn’t take long to realize that a mountain bike is much slower in pavement than a road bike not because it’s heavier, but because it has a much larger rolling resistance! Strap yourself an 8 lbs backpack when road biking and you can try testing this going uphill, straight or down.</p><p>So for mountain biking, rolling resistance is a major factor to your energy expenditure, and the amount of energy “wasted” by a tire at the wrong pressure can be really significant, easily over 15% on large tire. Remember this happens while climbing, rolling over flats and even downhill!  So in a typical ride, with our Hub you will end up spending less energy overall! </p><p>For 2, most of the added weight is in the center of the wheel, of which ~ 150 g are non-rotating mass.  Then the air-reservoir is actually supporting tire at low pressure and also providing a very strong shock protection to the rim.  This enables you to mount lighter, more efficient tires and also light but delicate rims.  A fully optimized wheel has a similar moment of inertia but with lower rolling resistance.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2) Why does it cost so much?</strong></p><p>Because it is very costly to manufacture...</p><p>Well, making a very large but still light-weight hub that can withstand all the punishment mountain biking can inflict requires the use only the best materials and processes available. The main structure of the hub that you can see is fully collaborated with European CNC partners (with USA negotiations underway). It’s not just made of your average 7075-T6 Aluminum (which is made in China. Oops!) but also it’s sourced from the most reputable USA providers. Similarly for the carbon fiber hub-body and the rest of the stuff that one cannot see from the outside.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>3) And… are there other advantages to the WhiteCrow Hub beyond tire pressure regulation?</strong></p><p>Yes, the oversized nature of the hub allows us to build wheels with shorter spokes in a wide “cantilever”. This results in much stiffer wheels, which are more energy efficient and handle better in rough terrain.  Note how SRAM highlights this feature in its new Boost standard; we do Boost and much better still!  </p><p>Also, the freewheel has over 130 engagement points (or less than 2.7 deg), this provides a very “tight” feeling with a practically-immediate return of pedaling power to get you out of any tricky situation.  Go ahead and check the internet to see how many competitors do better than us!</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Awesome benefits</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483173153/qxbsd3lhykqqytldguuz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483174238/jivr8xjcaz7s7md8ngm7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2>The journey - We need you Now!</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483174403/oqpkouazq8fyeveoldbx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Late 2013 </strong>--Initial idea under the shower after a night-ride across a muddy Belgian forest.</p><p><strong>Feb 2014</strong> -- First Patent Application.</p><p><strong>March 2014</strong> -- First engineering studies.  Industrial engineer Mathijs Verstraete joins, followed by bike wheel expert Rob Bruyndonckx. 1st iteration project starts in collaboration with the multidisciplinary industry research lab “Sirris” resulting in a complete conceptual mockup of the design.</p><p><strong>Oct 2014</strong> -- WhiteCrow Tech SA established.</p><p><strong>Dec 2015</strong> -- Award-winning industrial designer Etienne Brandt joins the team.

When deflating, air is stored in a reservoir where the pressure is higher than the air in the tire. This makes tire re-inflating effortless, fast and very clean.  The Buzz“This is a very interesting project. It’s something we at Ibis have been thinking about for a long time. Glad to see someone is trying it.”-- Scot Nicol, Founder “Just imagine using that in a race, how applicable it can be!”“Bottom line is, this will allow you to run even lower pressures and not bottom the tire out, just not even using the inner chamber to save your rim... I’d be really interested to see how this one works out. I think it could end up being in a really cool situation.” “The one Iditarod veteran we mentioned the hub to was extremely excited about the idea and hustled over to take a look- so White Crow may well find itself a hungry market.” “Besides just getting lower pressures and the associated improvement in comfort and traction, the WhiteCrow system has other side benefits. The inner air reservoir goes a long way to preventing tubeless burping, and also protects the rim from obstacle impacts and pinch flats. That also means you can ride much thinner (read: lighter) rims on more technical trails. The setup also makes it easier to mount non-tubeless tires and rims tubeless because of the added security.”“The WhiteCrow air pressure regulation system was developed in Belgium, and is said to be able to stand up to muddy and wet conditions. That’s good, because foul weather is probably where this type of a system would really shine.”  “As a competitive Fat Bike racer I need every advantage I can get. Often during races the snow conditions on the trail change and as little as a 1/2 psi tire pressure adjustment can make the difference between winning and losing. Having the ability to adjust tire pressures while on the bike keeps me moving efficiently and the WhiteCrow Hub is a promising approach.”-- Gabe Klamer, Winner of 200km Fat Pursuit 2016 “Fat Bikes are great fun, they can ride everywhere and they provide a lower rolling resistance than narrow tires, if they are set to the appropriate tire pressure. But that’s the main issue! Stepping off the bike to adjust tire pressure takes too much time.  A system that would allow me to adjust the pressure on the fly would be great and I would prefer WhiteCrow’s mechanical solution. That way you can just pick your bike for a ride instead of worry about an empty battery or CO2 canister!”-- Arnout Matthys, First biker on one leg to finish 650km Crocodile Trophy “Impressive!!! This looks amazing. We are very much looking forward installing the WhiteCrow Hub on our Fat Bikes!!!”-- David Espallargas, Founder  Why is this Revolutionary?A genius idea: an air-closed fully mechanical design, enabling almost instantaneous tire inflation in any situation. No refills nor batteries needed!Tire Inflation

 
Tire inflation is very simply achieved by releasing air from the high-pressure air reservoir into the tire. The WhiteCrow Hub has a simple bypass valve enabling this. This process is totally effortless and quick.

 
Tire deflation
 

This is where the magic happens:  the Air Pump is used to deflate the tire!
Tire deflation is achieved by compressing air from the tire into the reservoir. Inside the WhiteCrow Hub, a relatively large air compressor is driven by the wheel rotation itself (the Air Pump).
 Advantages of in-tire air reservoir
It prevents tubeless-ready burping.
It protects the rim from nasty knocks when the tire pressure is very low.
It allows for efficient rolling as there is no contact between the inner surface of the tire and the reservoir (except when you hit something hard, see above point).
Finally, weight is saved allowing the use of ultra-thin rims when this would normally be too risky.

   The magic inside the WhiteCrow HubOur hub is an engineering marvel and is probably the most audacious piece of technology introduced into mountain biking since the times of the first oleo-pneumatic forks. Moreover, while the first suspensions and disc brakes were “ports” of technologies initially developed for motorcycling, our hub is genuinely brand new kit specifically designed for mountain biking.  Our greatest engineering challenge, the Air Pump has no pistons but only two mechanically-actuated parts (with a core eccentric that translates rather than rotate). This allows for an all-temperature range as well as an ultra-light all-polymer design. Moreover, when the pump’s not in use it doesn’t generate any parasitic drag.  THE COMMAND CLUTCHThe clutch is controlled from the handlebar via a standard shifter cable routed along the bike’s frame and through the center axle of the wheel.

Deflation: Torque-modulated air-inflation through Air Pump actuation. THE HUB BODYThe lightweight oversized design with large flanges allows for building ultra-strong wheels. In 7075 T6 aluminum and light weight carbon fiber, the body is also designed for an optimized all-weather-proof (living in Belgium, we know what extensive mud damage looks like!). THE FREEWHEELTo be released in both Shimano 11x and SRAM XD versions, it provides over 130 engagement points… Nice, isn’t it?! WHAT ELSE?Obviously, we’ve designed our hub for easy maintenance.

<p><strong>A SUMMARY </strong></p>
<p><strong>FOR REAL VALUE PLEASE READ THOUGH THIS</strong></p>
<p>The art of real driving – <strong>OUR PASSION</strong></p>
<p>The art of driving eludes most people all their life.</p>
<p>Most drivers simply do not <strong>ever</strong> understand the art of driving nor are they <strong>aware of the wonderful experience</strong> to master and apply good driving skills.</p>
<p>At <strong>Rallystar Motorsport Academy</strong> in South Africa we refine top ranking competition driver's skills, train beginners saving them (especially the parents) huge amounts of money in the process.</p>
<p>Our youngest student was 14 and the eldest 79.</p>
<p><strong>We evaluate</strong> aspiring race - and rally drivers as well as navigators to confirm potential, or suggest another career. This is a <strong>great money saver</strong> as a lack of potential usually ends with an expensive accident, while we either manage to <strong>prevent damage or suggest a non-start</strong> well before damage occurs.</p>
<p>At our <strong>new venue our revised course</strong> will include training and educating young people to become safer and better drivers. <strong>A community service long overdue in South Africa.</strong></p>
<p>The owner of the <strong>Rallystar Motorsport Academy</strong>, <strong>Leon Botha</strong>, is a multiple rally champion and has been involved in the sport for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>His <strong>enthusiasm</strong> for the sport and his <strong>passion for driving</strong>, is <strong>legendary</strong> and makes him a deserving recipient of your contribution. To listen to him <strong>speak about the art of driving</strong> and his passion for the sport, <strong>is worth the effort and money</strong>. Just for interest sake, he also offers a motivational business course, <strong>“Rally your business to success!”</strong></p>
<p>Rallystar Motorsport Academy operated successfully at its previous venue, for more than 14 years until mid 2016 when the premises was sold.</p>
<p>After the sale, advanced negotiation for an alternative venue came to nothing, which was a <strong>great disappointment to all</strong>.</p>
<p>Leon then decided to take a sabbatical until he could find the <strong>“right spot”</strong> to reopen and run the business on, but took a firm decision not to re-start the business if he did not have the resources to apply his experience and make it work properly.</p>
<p>This would require a substantial amount of money and therefore <strong>this honest effort to raise the required funds </strong>through <strong>Indiegogo crowd-funding</strong>.</p>
<p>This humble but much needed effort <strong>relies on the support of people like yourself, </strong>who <strong>realized the importance</strong> of people being made aware of training to drive well!</p>
<p>Due to the lack of enough economically active people in South-Africa we need to admit that it is virtually impossible to raise the funding we need - which is why <strong>we truly depend on your generosity</strong>.  </p>
<p>Through the years, running Rallystar, Leon has paid millions in ""school fees""  and has done more for the sport and for driving skills, than most people who weer involved in motorsport.</p>
<p><strong>He truly deserves your support</strong> (no matter how big or small).</p>
<p>Leon says: “When I started Rallystar Motorsport Academy in 2002 there was no handbook, no guidelines or rules on which I could base this type of business, and goodness knows, I paid heavily for the lessons I had to learn!""</p>
<p>""This is why I decided that I would only restart Rallystar again, if I could afford to purchase the right equipment and do proper preparation of the tracks. If I can not get the right things in place, the maintenance of the cars will simply be too expensive and so will continuous preparation and maintenance of the roads be.”</p>
<p>""I want to make Rallystar a memorable experience for all involved!” he said and continued; “I have now <strong>successfully negotiated a fantastic new premises</strong>, much better and more convenient than the rugged “old” Rallystar – although I loved every inch of that ground!""</p>
<p>He added that, ""This time around I know how to start, what to allow and what not, how to control drivers  and how to save the cars from damage - <strong>because I wrote the only handbook!”</strong></p>
<p>“The new venue is in the <strong>perfect location</strong>, with <strong>diverse entertainment</strong>, <strong>accommodation for the customers</strong>, <strong>workshops</strong> and <strong>fantastic roads</strong> for us to work with.”</p>
<p><strong>“This will be magic!” he added, “any real driver’s dream!”</strong></p>
<p>Although the deal has been signed and sealed the venue may only be revealed once we are ready to start, which is also a reason for this urgent appeal.</p>
<p>The moment we reach the minimum startup funding, we will tell you all about this venue!</p>
<p><strong>You will love it!</strong></p>
<p>Did we mention that there is a <strong>nature reserve</strong> right next to the “<strong>new</strong>” Rallystar premises where the <strong>family can go for game drives</strong>, while <strong>the brave hearts drive rally cars</strong>.</p>
<p>There will be bicycle and horseback rides as well as other forms of entertainment - such as <strong>Hot Air Balloon-trips</strong> etc.</p>
<p>Rallystar will be <strong>a bucket list MUST</strong> for every tourist who aspires to experience Africa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>YOUR SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>We can not stress the <strong>importance</strong> of your support enough - your contribution will help re-establish this great academy in a country where its <strong>function is essential</strong>.</p>
<p>We will also invest our own funds, but this kite can only fly properly with your support.</p>
<p>You can <strong>help us achieve our new goals</strong> and at the same time <strong>contribute to road safety</strong> and help us <strong>create jobs</strong> in a country where <strong>unemployment is touching on the 60%</strong>.</p>
<p>There is always a demand for good drivers in the job market! <strong>HELP US, TO HELP THEM!</strong>  </p>
<p>We have in the past also <strong>trained quite a number of overseas visitors</strong> who came to South Africa <strong>specifically for this purpose</strong> and in most cases they insisted on being trained <strong>by the master of the game himself</strong>, Leon Botha.</p>
<p>You will find that over and above the good perks as incentive, we will <strong>apply your contribution wisely and effectively</strong>.</p> <p><strong>WHAT IS IN IT FOR ALL?</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is no two ways about it</strong> - if you want <strong>real holiday and business value</strong> – I mean real <strong>value for your Dollar, Pound or Euro</strong> - <strong>South Africa is where you will find it</strong>.</p>
<p>South Africa - is without doubt one of the most beautiful countries in the world. This is where you can see the <strong>perfect combination of human talent</strong> in development, the <strong>shortcomings of our society</strong> and at the same time - a few kilometers out of the cities - the <strong>grace and goodness of The Creator</strong>.   </p>
<p>A place where you can once again <strong>find a little peace for the soul</strong>, relax and enjoy the best of both worlds <strong>without spending tear-jerking amounts of money!</strong></p>
<p>At the writing of this proposal - your <strong>One Dollar’s</strong> worth <strong>fluctuated between 12 and 15 Rand</strong> - which means that about <strong>$8</strong> - yes <strong>eight Dollar</strong> will <strong>buy</strong> you a <strong>decent steak</strong> in an up-class restaurant!   </p>
<p><strong>A return trip</strong> to South Africa from the USA will cost you <strong>approximately $750</strong>, while a return trip <strong>from London to Johannesburg </strong>will cost you anything <strong>from £400 or €450</strong>. (Rates calculated on 8 September 2017 and flight estimated costs for May 2018)</p>
<p><strong>Can you beat that?</strong></p>
<p>Fact is, <strong>almost anyone can afford to visit this wonderful country.</strong></p>
<p>Your visit to the Rallystar Motorsport Academy is <strong>important</strong>  - as we would love to entertain you and give every qualifying contributor the best experience ever, but it is <strong>not essential.</strong></p>
<p>We will appreciate every contribution and will try to give you the acknowledgement you deserve.</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The perks for this offer will be valid until the <strong>end of 2020!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Better than that - no one can do!</strong></p>
<p><strong>PAY BACK…</strong></p>
<p>If by <strong>end 2020</strong> if you have <strong>contributed $500+</strong> but could not visit us and you will not be able to do so in the near future, then - we will pay back <strong>25%</strong> of your contribution <strong>within six months after a written confirmation that you can not take up the perks.</strong></p>
<p>Of course <strong>you may keep the cap and shirt</strong> if you qualified for it!</p>
<p>If you make a <strong>smaller contribution</strong> - you will still receive excellent and exclusive perks from us, to show our appreciation and who knows - <strong>we may still see you around and offer you special prices when you pay us a visit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY DO WE DEPEND ON YOUR HELP?</strong></p>
<p>As said - it is almost impossible to raise this sort of money in South Africa due to circumstances, which is why we appeal for your appreciated assistance.</p>
<p>With the required funding <strong>we will be able to establish a state of the art facility</strong> and run a number of <strong>proper rally- and training</strong> cars.</p>
<p>We <strong>will be able to start up without raising the full amount</strong> - and will extend and improve the quality of our service as we progress.</p>
<p>If you have a <strong>petrol head and heart</strong> and <strong>agree to assist</strong> we will be able to develop everything we need right from the start.</p> <p><strong>IN RETURN FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION</strong></p> <p><strong>THE +$500 CLUB</strong></p>
<p>Every person who contributes $500 or more will receive a fantastic treat when they visit South Africa. * (see the affordable rates above @ ""What is in it for all?"".)</p>

<p><strong>Can you</strong> drive a rally car memorizing instructions, executing one while listening to the next...??  </p>
<p>You will have an experienced navigator/instructor at your side and you will have to listen to the <strong>machine-gun-tempo instructions</strong> coming your way, listening to a new instruction, while executing a previous one, judging speed, applying power at the right moments, reducing speed where needed and at the same time keep the car on the route!</p>
<p><strong>A REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE</strong></p>

<p><strong>GENERAL</strong></p>

<p><strong>South Africans funding this project</strong> must <strong>please contact us directly</strong> to arrange their bonus packages and booking times.</p>
<p><strong>Special rates available for groups</strong> and <strong>fantastic corporate fun-days </strong>can be arranged!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO WE NEED?</strong></p>
<p>In order to set up this facility the way we want it to be, we need  funding for U$195 000</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW WILL THE FUNDING BE SPEND?</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest expenses will be the <strong>development and treatment of the tracks</strong> to reduce dust and compact the surface in an <strong>Eco-friendly</strong> way. This is also a contractual condition from the landowners to which we have agreed.</p>
<p>Just to put the Environmentalist's hearts at ease, hardly any bush or tree will be affected and the environment will be improved if anything.</p>
<p><strong>Rallystar won an evironmental award</strong> from the controlling body of motor-sport in South Africa while it was still situated at the previous premises. We are very environmentally conscious.  </p>
<p><strong>Almost 50% of the funding will go towards replacement rally vehicles.</strong></p>
<p>Leon is adamant to start with the best quality cars with durable suspensions. <strong>This was Rallystar's biggest expense</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>weakness</strong> during our first 14 year run and will now be <strong>eliminated.</strong></p>
<p>The aim is to purchase cars of the same make or at least two each of the same make to reduce the spares we need to carry.</p>
<p>If all the money is not raised Rallystar will start off with fewer vehicles and purchase more as the time goes by and finances allow.  </p>
<p>A good <strong>second-hand water truck </strong>(to contain the Africa dust) will be bought. This is an essential part of the setup to ensure dust control and will also be used to <strong>wet grassy areas and trees.</strong></p>
<p>We will acquire the <strong>best safety equipment</strong> to ensure the safety of all involved.</p>
<p>The <strong>recreation facility directly at the track</strong> area needs to  be upgraded to give everybody a great experience. This will also cost a fair amount of money - around 15% of budget</p>
<p><strong>A portion of the funding</strong> will be obviously <strong>be applied to cover the costs for your perks</strong> and to make sure you or your nominated guest <strong>enjoy great times with us!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We will make it worthwhile for you and prove that we deserve your trust.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT OF THIS VENTURE</strong></p>
<p>The Rallystar Motorsport Academy will <strong>contribute to local communities.</strong></p>
<p>We <strong>employ local people from the area during events</strong>, we also do some <strong>training and involve the community</strong> in the sport.</p>
<p>The venue will <strong>draw national and international currency</strong> to the area.</p>
<p>Most of all – if we  put this project together the way we hope and aim for, we will <strong>improve driver skills and quality of driving</strong> in South Africa and elsewhere.</p>
<p>It needs to be said that while Rallystar Motorsport Academy operated from its previous site, we <strong>trained a substantial number of  international competition drivers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tourists always loved the facility</strong> and we promise – <strong>you will all be crazy about the new one.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>We are here to give you more <strong>adrenaline driven excitement</strong> than you ever had behind the steering of a car.  We will <strong>make a trip to South Africa worthwhile</strong> or create <strong>the best present</strong> you can give any motoring enthusiast!</p>
<p>We will inform contributors who want to know, about special tourist packages to our beautiful country.</p>
<p>The tour can include other “adventures” such as Hot Air ballooning, white water rafting, bungee-jumps, game drives etc. at other venues. We have contacts form Cape Town to our Northern Borders.</p>
<p>See us as your friends and contact in South Africa.</p>
<p><strong>NOWHERE IS TOO FAR…</strong></p>
<p>Nowhere is too far to travel these days and Africa is <strong>one continent you have to visit</strong> before you depart from earth.</p>
<p>The <strong>exchange rate is totally in your favor</strong> and you will receive incredible value for your money!</p>
<p><strong>A few Pound, Euro or Dollar get you here and back!</strong></p>
<p><strong>They say Africa is where it all started – come have a look!</strong></p>
<p>Come enjoy the trip of a lifetime and top it all -  drive in a real rally car on the African Continent.</p>
<p><strong>Bucket list - TICK!</strong></p>
<p>Please spread the word and get your friends to join in.</p>
<p>We will appreciate every bit of help - even if you can not come visit - please help us.</p>
<p>Rallystar and Africa is fun, but even more so if you bring a few friends with.</p>

FOR REAL VALUE PLEASE READ THOUGH THIS
The art of real driving – OUR PASSION
The art of driving eludes most people all their life.
Most drivers simply do not ever understand the art of driving nor are they aware of the wonderful experience to master and apply good driving skills.
At Rallystar Motorsport Academy in South Africa we refine top ranking competition driver's skills, train beginners saving them (especially the parents) huge amounts of money in the process.
Our youngest student was 14 and the eldest 79.
We evaluate aspiring race - and rally drivers as well as navigators to confirm potential, or suggest another career. This is a great money saver as a lack of potential usually ends with an expensive accident, while we either manage to prevent damage or suggest a non-start well before damage occurs.
At our new venue our revised course will include training and educating young people to become safer and better drivers. A community service long overdue in South Africa.
The owner of the Rallystar Motorsport Academy, Leon Botha, is a multiple rally champion and has been involved in the sport for more than 40 years.
His enthusiasm for the sport and his passion for driving, is legendary and makes him a deserving recipient of your contribution. To listen to him speak about the art of driving and his passion for the sport, is worth the effort and money. Just for interest sake, he also offers a motivational business course, “Rally your business to success!”
Rallystar Motorsport Academy operated successfully at its previous venue, for more than 14 years until mid 2016 when the premises was sold.
After the sale, advanced negotiation for an alternative venue came to nothing, which was a great disappointment to all.
Leon then decided to take a sabbatical until he could find the “right spot” to reopen and run the business on, but took a firm decision not to re-start the business if he did not have the resources to apply his experience and make it work properly.
This would require a substantial amount of money and therefore this honest effort to raise the required funds through Indiegogo crowd-funding.
This humble but much needed effort relies on the support of people like yourself, who realized the importance of people being made aware of training to drive well!
Due to the lack of enough economically active people in South-Africa we need to admit that it is virtually impossible to raise the funding we need - which is why we truly depend on your generosity.  
Through the years, running Rallystar, Leon has paid millions in ""school fees""  and has done more for the sport and for driving skills, than most people who weer involved in motorsport.
He truly deserves your support (no matter how big or small).
Leon says: “When I started Rallystar Motorsport Academy in 2002 there was no handbook, no guidelines or rules on which I could base this type of business, and goodness knows, I paid heavily for the lessons I had to learn!""
""This is why I decided that I would only restart Rallystar again, if I could afford to purchase the right equipment and do proper preparation of the tracks. If I can not get the right things in place, the maintenance of the cars will simply be too expensive and so will continuous preparation and maintenance of the roads be.”
""I want to make Rallystar a memorable experience for all involved!” he said and continued; “I have now successfully negotiated a fantastic new premises, much better and more convenient than the rugged “old” Rallystar – although I loved every inch of that ground!""
He added that, ""This time around I know how to start, what to allow and what not, how to control drivers  and how to save the cars from damage - because I wrote the only handbook!”
“The new venue is in the perfect location, with diverse entertainment, accommodation for the customers, workshops and fantastic roads for us to work with.”
“This will be magic!” he added, “any real driver’s dream!”
Although the deal has been signed and sealed the venue may only be revealed once we are ready to start, which is also a reason for this urgent appeal.
The moment we reach the minimum startup funding, we will tell you all about this venue!
You will love it!
Did we mention that there is a nature reserve right next to the “new” Rallystar premises where the family can go for game drives, while the brave hearts drive rally cars.
There will be bicycle and horseback rides as well as other forms of entertainment - such as Hot Air Balloon-trips etc.
Rallystar will be a bucket list MUST for every tourist who aspires to experience Africa.
 
YOUR SUPPORT
We can not stress the importance of your support enough - your contribution will help re-establish this great academy in a country where its function is essential.
We will also invest our own funds, but this kite can only fly properly with your support.
You can help us achieve our new goals and at the same time contribute to road safety and help us create jobs in a country where unemployment is touching on the 60%.
There is always a demand for good drivers in the job market! HELP US, TO HELP THEM!  
We have in the past also trained quite a number of overseas visitors who came to South Africa specifically for this purpose and in most cases they insisted on being trained by the master of the game himself, Leon Botha.
You will find that over and above the good perks as incentive, we will apply your contribution wisely and effectively. WHAT IS IN IT FOR ALL?
There is no two ways about it - if you want real holiday and business value – I mean real value for your Dollar, Pound or Euro - South Africa is where you will find it.
South Africa - is without doubt one of the most beautiful countries in the world. This is where you can see the perfect combination of human talent in development, the shortcomings of our society and at the same time - a few kilometers out of the cities - the grace and goodness of The Creator.   
A place where you can once again find a little peace for the soul, relax and enjoy the best of both worlds without spending tear-jerking amounts of money!
At the writing of this proposal - your One Dollar’s worth fluctuated between 12 and 15 Rand - which means that about $8 - yes eight Dollar will buy you a decent steak in an up-class restaurant!   
A return trip to South Africa from the USA will cost you approximately $750, while a return trip from London to Johannesburg will cost you anything from £400 or €450. (Rates calculated on 8 September 2017 and flight estimated costs for May 2018)
Can you beat that?
Fact is, almost anyone can afford to visit this wonderful country.
Your visit to the Rallystar Motorsport Academy is important  - as we would love to entertain you and give every qualifying contributor the best experience ever, but it is not essential.
We will appreciate every contribution and will try to give you the acknowledgement you deserve.
Please note: The perks for this offer will be valid until the end of 2020!
Better than that - no one can do!
PAY BACK…
If by end 2020 if you have contributed $500+ but could not visit us and you will not be able to do so in the near future, then - we will pay back 25% of your contribution within six months after a written confirmation that you can not take up the perks.
Of course you may keep the cap and shirt if you qualified for it!
If you make a smaller contribution - you will still receive excellent and exclusive perks from us, to show our appreciation and who knows - we may still see you around and offer you special prices when you pay us a visit.
WHY DO WE DEPEND ON YOUR HELP?
As said - it is almost impossible to raise this sort of money in South Africa due to circumstances, which is why we appeal for your appreciated assistance.
With the required funding we will be able to establish a state of the art facility and run a number of proper rally- and training cars.
We will be able to start up without raising the full amount - and will extend and improve the quality of our service as we progress.
If you have a petrol head and heart and agree to assist we will be able to develop everything we need right from the start. IN RETURN FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION THE +$500 CLUB

WHAT DO WE NEED?
In order to set up this facility the way we want it to be, we need  funding for U$195 000
 
HOW WILL THE FUNDING BE SPEND?
One of the biggest expenses will be the development and treatment of the tracks to reduce dust and compact the surface in an Eco-friendly way. This is also a contractual condition from the landowners to which we have agreed.
Just to put the Environmentalist's hearts at ease, hardly any bush or tree will be affected and the environment will be improved if anything.
Rallystar won an evironmental award from the controlling body of motor-sport in South Africa while it was still situated at the previous premises. We are very environmentally conscious.  
Almost 50% of the funding will go towards replacement rally vehicles.
Leon is adamant to start with the best quality cars with durable suspensions. This was Rallystar's biggest expense and weakness during our first 14 year run and will now be eliminated.
The aim is to purchase cars of the same make or at least two each of the same make to reduce the spares we need to carry.
If all the money is not raised Rallystar will start off with fewer vehicles and purchase more as the time goes by and finances allow.  
A good second-hand water truck (to contain the Africa dust) will be bought. This is an essential part of the setup to ensure dust control and will also be used to wet grassy areas and trees.
We will acquire the best safety equipment to ensure the safety of all involved.
The recreation facility directly at the track area needs to  be upgraded to give everybody a great experience. This will also cost a fair amount of money - around 15% of budget
A portion of the funding will be obviously be applied to cover the costs for your perks and to make sure you or your nominated guest enjoy great times with us!
We will make it worthwhile for you and prove that we deserve your trust.
THE IMPACT OF THIS VENTURE
The Rallystar Motorsport Academy will contribute to local communities.
We employ local people from the area during events, we also do some training and involve the community in the sport.
The venue will draw national and international currency to the area.
Most of all – if we  put this project together the way we hope and aim for, we will improve driver skills and quality of driving in South Africa and elsewhere.
It needs to be said that while Rallystar Motorsport Academy operated from its previous site, we trained a substantial number of  international competition drivers.
Tourists always loved the facility and we promise – you will all be crazy about the new one.
CONCLUSION
We are here to give you more adrenaline driven excitement than you ever had behind the steering of a car.  We will make a trip to South Africa worthwhile or create the best present you can give any motoring enthusiast!
We will inform contributors who want to know, about special tourist packages to our beautiful country.
The tour can include other “adventures” such as Hot Air ballooning, white water rafting, bungee-jumps, game drives etc. at other venues. We have contacts form Cape Town to our Northern Borders.
See us as your friends and contact in South Africa.
NOWHERE IS TOO FAR…
Nowhere is too far to travel these days and Africa is one continent you have to visit before you depart from earth.
The exchange rate is totally in your favor and you will receive incredible value for your money!
A few Pound, Euro or Dollar get you here and back!
They say Africa is where it all started – come have a look!
Come enjoy the trip of a lifetime and top it all -  drive in a real rally car on the African Continent.
Bucket list - TICK!
Please spread the word and get your friends to join in.
We will appreciate every bit of help - even if you can not come visit - please help us.
Rallystar and Africa is fun, but even more so if you bring a few friends with.
We will be ready and waiting to receive you! Other Ways You Can Help
Please tell and share this with your friends. Tell them all about this great opportunity to become part of an incredible journey and let them contribute to a great cause.
Please use the Indiegogo-sharing facility – that will help us too.
That brings us to the end of this proposal but to the start of a great relationship that will help us develop a worthwhile venture.
We truly hope that we have convinced you to contribute - no matter how small.
Thank you from our Rallystar Hearts - hope to see you soon - so we can make this wonderful gesture up to you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our Patented rotating buckle not only allows for easy transformation between backpack and duffle bag but also makes it one of the most comfortable bags on the market.The buckles allow the shoulder and hip belts to move freely keeping the paq in the most ergonomic position as you walk.  
Do you offer a warranty?
Yes. While we are a start up we will absolutely stand behind our product and offer a warranty on our bags.

Can I return my bag if I don't like it?

Shipping Information
We are proud to offer free shipping in the USA and discounted International shipping. In the USA, shipping will be sent via ground by UPS, USPS, DHL or Fedex. For international shipping, your order may be handed off to your local post office for final delivery. Our prices do not include VAT, GST, or any of the other various duties and taxes. You will be responsible to pay these.
Paq bags was created by reinventing something that you didn't even know needed to be reinvented. We turned the simple buckle into a 360 degree rotating buckle and designed the perfect travel bag around these buckles.Paq Bag founder, Matthew Jensen, created the buckle in 2011 and was granted a patent in 2015. Travel and backpack enthusiast Alex Howard joined the team to help design a travel bag that would be both functional and revolutionary. After creating the first round of prototypes, Alex set off on a month long journey to Peru to test the bag first hand. Since then, prototypes have traveled all over the world and with each new journey came new ideas to better the bags. They had designed the perfect travel bag, but something was still missing.Tech guru and fellow traveler, Chase Bell, made the team complete and helped spread the word and launch the company. Countless hours have been spent by this group of travelers and entrepreneurs to bring you the perfect travel bag.Now it's your turn to get a Paq and see the world.We want to be completely transparent with you guys about our product and our campaign.We have been working at this launch for multiple years now, and we are working with a major reliable factory in Vietnam to bring you the product at the highest quality and on time. We won't name names, but this factory works with some major brands and even has a track record of bringing other highly successful crowdfunded bag projects to market on time.Unfortunately, in this world things can go wrong, but we are hoping they do not and it runs smoothly. The worst case for you as a backer is that there is a delay in you receiving your backer reward.We have been, and will continue to do everything in our power to make sure everything is on time, but want to thank you in advance for being understanding if there is a delay.Let's talk some specific hypotheticals:If this campaign is tremendously successful (20,000+ backers), our factory has promised they can make as many bags as we need, but there may be issues. For instance, we could use up the stock of the shell material, and would have to wait for the textile factory to make more for us.Another source of uncertainty is navigating shipping container, and import issues. We anticipate this will be straight forward, but it is not something we can handle ahead of time. Shipping companies don't like to talk to you until you have an actual shipment you need to make.",43.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Technical Details</h3>
<p><strong>What will the Production version of THUMB SAVER look like?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly  the same as the pre-production prototype that was fully tested and viewed in our video's but will include some minor improvements not noticeable.</p>
<p><strong>What will THUMB SAVER be made of?</strong></p>
<p>The Thumb Saver will be constructed from durable nylon materials and stainless steel components specially selected for harsh outdoor environments. It features a highly responsive sealed ball bearing unit selected for minimal possible friction and greatest possible feel on the line to maintain your angling experience. A super tough interchangeable heavy duty Fuji Guide is supplied to protect the line and avoid wear or damage.</p>

<p><strong>WHO'S MANUFACTURING?</strong></p>
<p>We are. Our team mate Mike Burke from <a href=""https://jamb.com.au/thumb-saver/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jamb Design Solutions</a> is appointed to design and manufacture all tooling and equipment necessary for us to fulfill all orders of the THUMB SAVER.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Risk</strong></p>
<p>Virtually none. We have successfully produced and  fully tested the  pre-production prototype. as seen in the earlier videos. Before we designed and  built the pre-production version,  we built <strong>a proof of concept prototype</strong> so we could thoroughly test the concept . We know it works; simple as that. Watch the video.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DBlOzPNsIY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Manufacturing THUMB SAVER is a no brainer. All tooling and manufacturing costs have been fully quoted.  <strong>We are ready to go!</strong></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><p style=""text-align: left;"">Here's an image of the first assembled pre-production prototype when it was first made and assembled.</p></div>

<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>In the case for our straps design, the compounds available for 3D machining required for prototyping them, meant the material was harder or stiffer than we intended in our design.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516222440/g6rergep5oqhxol3c7pw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Even though they worked,  they were harder to tighten up or loosen. In our manufactured version, we will be using a softer more durable material.  So we have resolved to <strong>allow time for fine tuning</strong> in the tooling phase of our project to make them work. Based on our design, we know it can be done because its been done before.  Worst case scenario is that we supply off-the shelf straps that will do the job.</p>
<p>That's why we have asked you to <strong>allow us up to 3-4 months shipping</strong> from the end of our campaign <strong>to allow us sufficient time to make the tooling and fine tune the dies</strong> to final production quality, before we can place our first production order and then ship direct to you.</p>
<p>Please be patient, we will keep you informed regularly as we progress from when we start making the  tooling, right through to our first production order.</p>

Dino Appla - Retired  Rocket Scientist, and co-inventor.
 

And we teamed up with  Mike Burke, JAMB Systems Pty Ltd  - our Industrial Designer and Manufacturer to develop the THUMB SAVER.

 
Technical Details
What will the Production version of THUMB SAVER look like?
Exactly  the same as the pre-production prototype that was fully tested and viewed in our video's but will include some minor improvements not noticeable.
What will THUMB SAVER be made of?
The Thumb Saver will be constructed from durable nylon materials and stainless steel components specially selected for harsh outdoor environments. It features a highly responsive sealed ball bearing unit selected for minimal possible friction and greatest possible feel on the line to maintain your angling experience. A super tough interchangeable heavy duty Fuji Guide is supplied to protect the line and avoid wear or damage.

WHO'S MANUFACTURING?
We are. Our team mate Mike Burke from Jamb Design Solutions is appointed to design and manufacture all tooling and equipment necessary for us to fulfill all orders of the THUMB SAVER.
 THUMB SAVER is Australian Invented, Designed and Made

 
Risks and Challenges
Risk
Virtually none. We have successfully produced and  fully tested the  pre-production prototype. as seen in the earlier videos. Before we designed and  built the pre-production version,  we built a proof of concept prototype so we could thoroughly test the concept . We know it works; simple as that. Watch the video.

Manufacturing THUMB SAVER is a no brainer. All tooling and manufacturing costs have been fully quoted.  We are ready to go!
Here's an image of the first assembled pre-production prototype when it was first made and assembled.

Challenges
In the case for our straps design, the compounds available for 3D machining required for prototyping them, meant the material was harder or stiffer than we intended in our design.  

Even though they worked,  they were harder to tighten up or loosen. In our manufactured version, we will be using a softer more durable material.  So we have resolved to allow time for fine tuning in the tooling phase of our project to make them work. Based on our design, we know it can be done because its been done before.  Worst case scenario is that we supply off-the shelf straps that will do the job.
That's why we have asked you to allow us up to 3-4 months shipping from the end of our campaign to allow us sufficient time to make the tooling and fine tune the dies to final production quality, before we can place our first production order and then ship direct to you.
Please be patient, we will keep you informed regularly as we progress from when we start making the  tooling, right through to our first production order.

<p>Hello!  The GoGo Guide team is made up of Americans and Russians who have taken part in international exchange programs as language partners, tutors, and/or students.  We care passionately about cross-cultural communication and helping different people get along through mutual understanding.  Language and cultural knowledge are key to understanding people from other cultures, so we have created GoGo Guide to help people learn and connect with each other and improve their linguistic and cultural skills. </p>
<p>We want to help tourists and foreign students make meaningful connections within their host cultures.  We want to help interested locals meet foreigners in their cities.  We want to encourage cultural exchange and help people to competently speak foreign languages. </p>
<p>The GoGo Guide App will involve an interactive map, which users can use to find friends, language partners, tutors, guides, and professional language teachers in their city.  Users can create or join groups, earn money by helping or tutoring others, and learn about or organize local events.  The main goal of the app is face-to-face interaction between users.  Users can find others who can help them improve their language skills in a variety of languages, or just find someone who can help them find their way around an unfamiliar city or country.  The goal is not only the improvement of language skills, but also the development of cross-cultural friendships. </p>
<p>The goal of this funding campaign is to fund the programming and development costs for the creation of the GoGo Guide App.  We have already identified a team of ready programmers.   Once we reach our funding goal, we expect to have our App launched within three months! </p>
<p>We have identified our funding costs as $15,000, which will pay our team of programmers for their time developing the GoGo Guide platform.  The idea and the plan for GoGo Guide are ready to go.  We want to develop the app as quickly as possible and launch our app within three months after our funding campaign.  If we do not reach our goal, the funding will still go toward the programming costs of the app, but the development of the app will be slower as we continue to raise funds. </p>
<p>If you contribute to our campaign, we will give you two main perks.  First, you will have access to an advertisement-free version of GoGo Guide for life.  And second, you will be able to earn money with GoGo Guide as a guide or tutor without paying any commission to GoGo Guide. </p>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute, please tell other people about our project!  The app will start in major cities, but we hope to expand to college towns and tourist destinations throughout the world.  Please spread the word about GoGo Guide at your university, to your friends, and to multicultural organizations in your city! </p>
<p>Help us promote international friendship and understanding today! </p>

Multiple Docking Station (Wireless or Cable Charging of your Smartphone, Smartwatch - especially Apple Watch, Power Bank, Trackers & more) - DOCKING VIDEO LINK - 00:27


Double Holder for Watching Movies (Landscape Mode for Smartphone & Tablet) - MOVIE VIDEO LINK - 00:32

Ambient Smart LED Light (On/Off, Dimming Effect, Multi Color Ambient) - LED VIDEO LINK - 00:17
        

Fully Portable (able to charge multiple devices wherever you are thanks to the integrated Power Bank)

         

Meet STÆTIONToday
everyone wants to use the newest technology designed for staying connected with
family and friends, watching the latest movies and using multiple apps in our
everyday lives. For this purpose we are using our smartphones, smartwatches,
trackers and other smart devices. All of these accessories need to be charged
almost every day.However
with necessary charging our living space is losing harmony, clarity and other aesthetic
aspects. With this in mind STÆTION was created to be a fully multi-functional Docking Station with a strong focus on exclusive design.If
you wish to have a rest, you can simply close your STÆTION and enjoy the moment
in a nice relaxed atmosphere......whenever
you wish, you can Watch Movies in landscape mode position and have a full
access to your devices during charging time.For
your comfort we also integrated a Smart LED Ambient Light into the
STÆTION as a possible replacement of your traditional desk lamp.With
the dimming effect you can select the light intensity to suit your moods... ...and the LED multicolor function helps you to arrange the desired atmosphere for every moment.Additionally,
in the watching mode position you can simply change the STÆTION to be your
desk clock or alarm clock using the different kinds of already existing
applications (e.g. Dock Clock for Android, Rise & Shine for iOS). 
EASY Grip & Stability

Thanks to the integrated EASY Grip system you have quick and easy access
to your smartphone. Additionally a gap between back of your
smartphone and the dock bottom part allows you to put your fingers slightly
under your phone.The Micro-Suction Cup Technology holds your phone and the whole STÆTION secure. 
Docking Everywhere

Thanks to the compact design and the integrated massive Power Bank with 10.000 mAh you can use all of the STÆTION features everywhere.Store EverythingDown storage space of your STÆTION is primary  constructed for charging  smartphones.However you choose those mobile devices you want to store or charge in the upper storage space (for specifications please see the chapters below). Alternatively you can store also your jewelry and mechanical watches in the upper storage space if you wish.STÆTION Materials

On
the way from the idea to the first functional prototype many different natural
materials have been approved in order to meet the design and construction
requirements. Finally
we chose Aluminium as a native environmentally friendly material because
of its stability and excellent optical properties in brushed surface form. We
also chose Wood as a very light construction material with great
properties and with its peaceful and soothing effect without compromising its
durability. Wood as a surface material also presents its organic natural
beauty.                          For
creating STÆTION we use only certified wood (FSC and PEFC) from sustainable
forestry and STÆTION is originally designed and handmade in Austria, Europe. 
All another materials (e.g. LED lights, electric cables, switcher, power bank
etc.) are certified to meet all necessary regulation.STÆTION Specifications

Surfing has been our passion since We were little boy. My brother and I both joined the Navy and served 20 years. We are both disabled Veterans but we don’t let that slow us down. <br/>We started building surfboards because we love surfing, the ocean, the waves, and the community. We have so much experience from our Military careers that we decided to go at it on our own. <br/>We have ran a successful business for 5 years in the state the Navy dropped us both off ( Virginia) after consulting our families we thought it best to get closer to family and we moved the business. <br/>This move was tough on us, our families, and our businesses of course. We lost a few big ticket items in the move that have set us back a little. We also are owed a large sum by a surf shop that should go out of business and it seems recouping those funds will either take a long time or not at all. Not getting paid for product you made is tough to swallow. <br/>We are resilient and are working hard to recoupe these losses. We have so many exciting and new plans for us to engage in our community. Such as, Surf for Autism, surf for the cure, we also repair used boards and give back to unfortunate children who want to learn to surf, or we give the boards to the Disabled Veterans Surf club so they can take veterans with all sort of ailments surfing.  </h3></div><div>

</div></div>","My brother and I (Joe and Matt) the owners of our Surfboard Surf Shop. Surfing has been our passion since We were little boy. My brother and I both joined the Navy and served 20 years. We are both disabled Veterans but we don’t let that slow us down. We started building surfboards because we love surfing, the ocean, the waves, and the community. We have so much experience from our Military careers that we decided to go at it on our own. We have ran a successful business for 5 years in the state the Navy dropped us both off ( Virginia) after consulting our families we thought it best to get closer to family and we moved the business. This move was tough on us, our families, and our businesses of course. We lost a few big ticket items in the move that have set us back a little. We also are owed a large sum by a surf shop that should go out of business and it seems recouping those funds will either take a long time or not at all. Not getting paid for product you made is tough to swallow. We are resilient and are working hard to recoupe these losses. We have so many exciting and new plans for us to engage in our community. Such as, Surf for Autism, surf for the cure, we also repair used boards and give back to unfortunate children who want to learn to surf, or we give the boards to the Disabled Veterans Surf club so they can take veterans with all sort of ailments surfing.

<p>At Grand Fusion Housewares, we design products to make life easier. We work with a talented group of product designers and inventors.  We focus on products we are passionate about. And, that includes keeping drinks cold in hot weather. </p>
<p>There are many water bottles and beverage insulators on the market, but we wanted something that was multi-functional that could be used in a wide variety of situations including the beach, pool, tailgating, camping, hiking, and more....  We wanted something that could really take a beating and hold up to the challenges of someone with an active lifestyle.  We reached out to our customers to get feedback from them on an ideal solution and we also added our own ideas. We then collaborated with Gary Moore to make the product beautiful. The result is the Icy Bev Kooler V 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CAN INSULATOR</strong> – The double wall vacuum sealed base will fit most 12 oz. beer and soda cans keeping them ice cold for hours. Use the sizing disc for proper fit on short cans.</p>

You can either paddle together, or you can steer the canoe from the back while your paddling partner enjoys a carefree experience.   Seek out new travel routes We have gathered already more than hundred adventures and travel routes all over the world from our fellow ONAK enthusiasts. All of these can be found on our website. We would love to hear about your ONAK adventures as well.As seen onOK, a tiny bit of boasting should be allowed :)  The launch of ONAK did not go unnoticed. Our canoe has received several awards including a Great Gear Award, an Outdoor Industry Award and a Bizidee Award.   Alos, ONAK has gathered exposure in highly respected media sources such as National Geographic, Business Insider, and Canoeroots Magazine. Moreover the reinvention of ONAK 2.0 was already featured in the renowned Tech & Science magazine New Atlas.We developed the ONAK 2.0 to make paddling even easier and more accessible than ever before. The countless adventures of our customers provided us with amazing feedback. Now we've implemented all these suggestions in our ONAK 2.0. Let’s take a look at what we improved.Stronger  ONAKs are made from an in-house developed Honeycomb - Curv™ Polypropylene composite. After hours of study and development we have created a material that is lighter, stiffer, and stronger than the aluminium used in classic canoes (strength-to-weight). The fold lines are flexible so they can be folded and unfolded for thousands of times. Simplified  A pulley system has been added to the straps. Not only does this require minimal effort to tighten, but the straps stay permanently connected so you don’t have to figure out which buckle fits where. This system really speeds up the set-up process.Once on the water, the canoe moves fast thanks to its streamlined design: The stiffness transfers your the energy instead of absorbing it, while still being comfortable with the adjustable wooden seats. Assembling the ONAK takes less than 15 minutes and disassembling only takes about 5 minutes. Compact  ONAK delivers the high quality of a professional canoe, but without any of the usual hassle like storage place and transportation limitations due to size and weight.  Fold the ONAK and enjoy the many possibilities of transportation: stash it in the trunk of your car, carry it around on foot or with public transport or attach it to a bicycle.This whole project could never have been possible without the support of our loyal community. Which is why we want to offer a reward for our awesome backers: Every ONAK owner who refers a friend to support this Kickstarter will receive a message and is able to get a little extra. With the help of our loyal community, we gathered all the feedback to further achieve our end goal: to provide everyone with the means to paddle wherever and whenever they want, without having to settle for lesser quality or experience.We are convinced that the result does the trick, as we managed to improve on many product features of an already remarkable product.

</span></div>","The BOWRANGER is the world’s first commercially available electronic bow 

sight with integrated rangefinder. The power of the BOWRANGER lies in the speed and accuracy with which a perfect shot can be achieved.It takes care of all human factors and removes all the guesswork


no distance guessing


no interpolation errors between pins


no missed opportunities due to time consuming
ranging and guessing  


no more wounded animals (more ethical hunting)


Just RANGE-AIM-SHOOT because the BOWRANGER does all the work for you!

How does the BOWRANGER supports ethical hunting?

No Guessing:  Precision arrow placement. The BOWRANGER measures the distance and angle to the target and calculates the correct pin setting for the selected arrow. The correct pin is then highlighted (LED marker) ensuring precision arrow placement.
Speed:  Ranging, calculating and setting the correct LED marker takes less than 0.2s. Thus the full cycle of targeting, ranging, aiming and shooting can be achieved in the shortest time possible when the shot is clean. 
Stealth:  No additional body movement as with the use of a hand-held rangefinder.

How does the BOWRANGER work?


Range Finder:  The specially developed small and light weight integrated range finder has a single measurement function and also a continuous scan function which will allow the user to scan distances every second without pressing any button. In scan mode the correct LED marker will also be continuously 

updated.  
Arrows and Pins:  Up to 10 arrows with up to 10 pins per arrow can be calibrated and stored for up to 5 users.


not limited to a small number of pins. More pins equals higher accuracy


not restricted to one arrow type when hunting


seamless switching between users and arrow types


backup and share calibration via USB.

Pins:  Actual flight path parameters are established from
the calibrated pins. The perfect pin for the perfect shot is calculated based on these parameters. This completely eliminates the user guessing between
pins under stressful conditions. The BOWRANGER  is equipped with 64 pins, more than a 

pin for every meter under ethical
hunting conditions. 

Angle shots: The pin position is compensated for inclined and declined shots.



OLED Screen: The clear OLED Screen provides feedback to the user. The feedback includes:







target distance so the user can determine if the
correct target was ranged


angle of shot


rotation angle of bow for increased accuracy


battery status


temperature


warning messages to enhance ethical hunting.


Ambient light sensor:  OLED screen and pin indicator brightness is continuously updated according to ambient light intensity to avoid glare.



Battery: The BOWRANGER is equipped with a lithium polymer battery compatible with 5V micro USB cell phone chargers. It provides 16 hours of continuous use from a 2 hour charge cycle. (This is adequate for many weeks of active hunting.) An auto power off battery saving function is standard.




How to use the BOWRANGER while hunting?




Aim to Range:  When aiming at a target you simply aim through the peep sight on the target and get the center green LED marker on target. A manual sight is also provided.



Range: When the green LED marker is on target press the range button and the desired red LED marker for that distance will be illuminated and the distance displayed on 

the OLED screen.




Aim to Shoot: Aim at the target with the illuminated red marker.



Shoot: When the illuminated  red LED marker is on target just release the arrow.



How do I mount the BOWRANGER on my bow?




Mounting:  Mounting your BOWRANGER to your bow is similar to mounting a conventional sight. The only difference is that the BOWRANGER has a three axis mount that allows the rangefinder to be aligned.




Range Button: The BOWRANGER is equipped with an extended ranging button that is mounted to the bow's grip, allowing ranging with the bow in a fully drawn position.




We need your support!

has been on the market since 1940. We have just given them a new shape and utilization.
Despite their size, they last up to 50% time of a usual pen. They stick firmly
inside the pen and you can therefore write with an incredible precision.</p>

to use materials of good quality. </p>

<p>We would like to make Infinity Pen something far more
than a usual pen. Good design, minimalistic, elegant. Some products simply do
not deserve the plastic material. The body is made from aluminium and the pen
parts stick together using neodymium magnets sometimes referred to as ‘rare
earth’.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Aluminium:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Aluminium is theoretically 100% recyclable
     without any loss of its natural qualities. </li>
<li>We have used aluminium because it is lighter than
     titanium and it preserves its hardness and resistance as well. The pen is
     therefore very resistant and it can last very long. It is also not unduly
     heavy.</li>

neodymium magnet:</b></p>

     Sumitoto Special Metals.</li>
<li>Neodymium magnets are the strongest type of
     permanent magnet commercially available.</li>

     the parts together.</li>

<p>100% of money will be used on the first production
run. In addition, it will also be used on keeping the sufficient amount of
fillings in store for the future refilling. Our goal is little bit more
ambitious than selling some because the pen consists of more parts and each
requires a special attention during the preparation of manufacturing. None of
the existing forms can be used for creation our parts. There is therefore no
risk of neglecting a certain part of the pen and all the parts will be of the
highest quality.</p>

<p>The preparation of the product and everything connected with it took us
almost a year. During this long period, we managed to solve everything in
advance. Everything is ready and settled. Manufacturers are the best in their
field and we have also services of great technicians and designers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main risk, which might occur, is a delay in the manufacturing process
due to unexpected issues. However, we will be receiving frequent updates after
the fundraising campaign so you will stay informed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Another possible risk must be mentioned. It is the fact that after finishing
the package, we will no longer have full control over the exact time the
package gets to you. It might be slower or faster in some states. The
unexpected checks at the customs might also cause some problems. We have
already some tips on reliable delivery services but we are also open to your
suggestions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The most formidable challenge is to expand the availability of fillings and
pens in local stores as much as possible. Furthermore, it is also the development
of new types of filling, with which we will broaden the usage of Infinity Pen.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>The last but not least, we would like to thank
everyone who has decided to join us. We have spent tremendous amount of time and
effort on fruition of this project. The result has far exceeded our initial
expectations. We cannot wait till the product hits the market.</b></p>

</b><p><b>Can the magnets
damage my cell phone or credit card?</b></p>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>The magnets in
the <b>pen</b> have no effect on cell phones, tablets or modern laptops whatsoever. The
magnets in the Infinity Pen have no such power to damage any modern electronic
device. The same applies to credit cards.</p>
<p>We do not
recommend putting precious metal things, such as watch, on <b>Levitation Box</b>. There are stronger magnets than the ones in the pen,
which could damage delicate metal parts inside. Levitation Box is meant only
for Infinity Pen.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Can other fillings be used to refill Infinity Pen?</b></p>
<p>The only usable fillings
are the ones meant for Infinity Pen. After the end of the fundraising campaign,
we guarantee the availability of all types of fillings on our e-shop worldwide.
One of our primary objectives after the fundraising campaign is to ensure the
availability of fillings in local stores of our partners. We are willing to
cooperate with other manufacturers of pens and fillings.</p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","Sharing our project is also huge help for us. Thank you that you care. For
many creative people, pen is the most powerful tool ever created. It is the
tool, from which the concepts of the most successful business on the planet
come. We can also include there design concepts and countless groundbreaking ideas,
which would otherwise stay merely thoughts without paper and pen. These ideas
could have been conveyed only because of the discipline and diligence of its
authors.   With
this modular pen, you can now save your ideas, create new projects, and put
down any notes more effectively every day. Or
you can simply play with the magnets just for fun. There are 729 possibilities how to design this modular pen. Because you know what suit’s you the best.                  „Design is not just what it looks like. Design is how it works.“Steve Jobs     TIP: INFINITY Pen is great for students and people who would like to learn or get better at something because the more we visualize things on paper, the easier it is for our brain to absorb and learn new things. 







TIP:
Especially creative people can put a better and easier visualization to a good
use in order to keep track of their whole concept and thoughts while making
something new.
Featured on:





Pen itself is made from high quality materials as aluminium and neodymium magnets. There are 9 high quality refills you can put inside Infinity Pen.





You
do not have to worry about the technical quality of our refills. Our chosen manufacturer
has been on the market since 1940. We have just given them a new shape and utilization.
Despite their size, they last up to 50% time of a usual pen. They stick firmly
inside the pen and you can therefore write with an incredible precision.
Available refills are:






Technical
info:


A tip of the blue pen’s filling is technically similar to Pilot Hi-Tec-C pen’s

All markers have
0.5mm tips

A tip of a
highlighter is triangle-shaped leaving a trace 1 to 4mm wide
Our fillings are
basically the same as the ones usually obtainable but they have a slightly
changed shape so they can fit inside the Infinity Pen








All these options will allow you to adjust the pen according to your
personality because you know exactly what is the most suitable for you. If you
find out that you need something new then you easily put the old fillings out
and put the new ones in. You can have an entirely new tool then.



            

As the authors of Infinity Pen, we personally prefer using a combo pen/red
thin marker/green thin marker combination.
TIP: You can add more fillings in the rewards. They may come handy when
you run out of them.
You design! We provide!



      „INFINITY PEN , infinity possibilities! Hmm… actually.. it’s 729
possibilities“

Availability
of fillings:
After
the end of the campaign, we will be able to guarantee the availability of all
fillings on our e-shop with a possibility to ship anywhere in the world. It will
be in stock in America as well as in Europe. We hope that some penguins also join
the campaign so that we could open a store in Antarctica. We are already trying
to get the pen inside established local shops of other traders. 
         
                „The deepest creativity bleeds from the pen of inspiration""                                 
We do hope that we will manage to accomplish everything together. After the end of this campaign, the pens as well as fillings can be available even in your city.


          


What is hidden under the second cap? 


                           Ohh yeah! It's stylus. Because everybody need's one. 
A stylus will automatically become a part of every pen for free.



A width of the
     stylus is 5 mm 


It can be used on all contact
     surfaces, smartphones, and tablets. (iPhone / iPad / Samsung devices / HTC
     devices / Nokia / Sony / LG / ... and many other) 








Your pen is a powerful tool, which accompanies you
throughout your whole day and therefore we think that it absolutely necessary
to use materials of good quality. 


We would like to make Infinity Pen something far more
than a usual pen. Good design, minimalistic, elegant. Some products simply do
not deserve the plastic material. The body is made from aluminium and the pen
parts stick together using neodymium magnets sometimes referred to as ‘rare
earth’.
Aluminium:                                                                   „rare earth“ neodymium magnet:



We wanted to create premium tool, so we had to use premium materials and premium parts.

Aluminium:

Aluminium is theoretically 100% recyclable
     without any loss of its natural qualities. 
We have used aluminium because it is lighter than
     titanium and it preserves its hardness and resistance as well. The pen is
     therefore very resistant and it can last very long. It is also not unduly
     heavy.


‘Rare earth’
neodymium magnet:

Also known
     as NdFeB, NIB or Neo magnet.
Developed in 1982 by General Motors and
     Sumitoto Special Metals.
Neodymium magnets are the strongest type of
     permanent magnet commercially available.
The pen can be used more comfortably because of
     these magnets, which save your time you would otherwise spend on screwing
     the parts together.






We are more than pleased to introduce you the most elegant and ingenious pedestal
for a pen in the world.        
   
         „Simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication.“  Leonardo Da Vinci

Our first goal was to create an effective tool for creative people. It was not until then when we realized what the neodymium magnets have to offer. 
They are absolutely brilliant!
Anyone, who comes to your office / room / kitchen or anywhere where your pen is, will stand astonished by its clear and minimalistic design.

         
The pen
beautifully levitates above the box and its one side is leaned on a transparent
glass ‘crystal glass’. The pedestal also serves as a beautiful box in which the
pen will get to you. 
      

The box/pedestal
can be considered as the so-called icing on the cake and it clearly
demonstrates that practical things can
also be elegant.




The box is made from high quality oak wood and cork.
           


TIP: Levitation box is a very convenient, elegant, and
unusual asset for your office or desk.




100% of money will be used on the first production
run. In addition, it will also be used on keeping the sufficient amount of
fillings in store for the future refilling. Our goal is little bit more
ambitious than selling some because the pen consists of more parts and each
requires a special attention during the preparation of manufacturing. None of
the existing forms can be used for creation our parts. There is therefore no
risk of neglecting a certain part of the pen and all the parts will be of the
highest quality.
We hope that together we will be able to finish this amazing product.



We thank everyone who has decided to support our project. To show good
faith, we would like to offer you our product for cheaper price before the
others can buy it.
Special offer for students: 

We have prepared an extended version for the price of the standard one for
the secondary school and university students.

of your student’s ID on student@infinitypens.com --> we will then send you
the Infinity Pen extended =)

TIP: You can choose any colours, types of filling, pens, and boxes in a
survey, which we will send you to your email at the end of this fundraising
campaign.







Special offer for supporters from Canada:  We have a special present for all supporters from Canada. You will get one extra magical mini neodymium magnet with every purchased Infinity Pen.


Worldwide shippping included in every perk!





TIP: Infinity Pen will get to you before Christmas. It
can become a very unusual and useful Christmas present.

How to choose Infinity Pen colour, levitation box colour, type, colour, and
number of refills?

After the fundraising campaign, you will be sent a survey where you will be
able to choose the pen’s colour, levitation box colour, type, colour and number
of refills.
How To Make Fresh Orange Juice



The preparation of the product and everything connected with it took us
almost a year. During this long period, we managed to solve everything in
advance. Everything is ready and settled. Manufacturers are the best in their
field and we have also services of great technicians and designers.

The main risk, which might occur, is a delay in the manufacturing process
due to unexpected issues. However, we will be receiving frequent updates after
the fundraising campaign so you will stay informed.

Another possible risk must be mentioned. It is the fact that after finishing
the package, we will no longer have full control over the exact time the
package gets to you. It might be slower or faster in some states. The
unexpected checks at the customs might also cause some problems. We have
already some tips on reliable delivery services but we are also open to your
suggestions.

The most formidable challenge is to expand the availability of fillings and
pens in local stores as much as possible. Furthermore, it is also the development
of new types of filling, with which we will broaden the usage of Infinity Pen.

The last but not least, we would like to thank
everyone who has decided to join us. We have spent tremendous amount of time and
effort on fruition of this project. The result has far exceeded our initial
expectations. We cannot wait till the product hits the market.



Can the magnets
damage my cell phone or credit card?


The magnets in
the pen have no effect on cell phones, tablets or modern laptops whatsoever. The
magnets in the Infinity Pen have no such power to damage any modern electronic
device. The same applies to credit cards.
We do not
recommend putting precious metal things, such as watch, on Levitation Box. There are stronger magnets than the ones in the pen,
which could damage delicate metal parts inside. Levitation Box is meant only
for Infinity Pen.


Can other fillings be used to refill Infinity Pen?
The only usable fillings
are the ones meant for Infinity Pen. After the end of the fundraising campaign,
we guarantee the availability of all types of fillings on our e-shop worldwide.
One of our primary objectives after the fundraising campaign is to ensure the
availability of fillings in local stores of our partners. We are willing to
cooperate with other manufacturers of pens and fillings.


How much does
the whole pen weigh?
Infinity Pen standard with fillings weighs 25 grams or 0.882 ounces
Infinity Pen extension with fillings weighs 35 grams or 1.235 ounces
Why do you want
to check my student ID?
Scanned or photographed student ID is only to verify that you still
study. All the personal details will not made public anywhere and we will erase
all the data after rewards have been sent.

Why do the
supporters from Canada get an extra magical mini magnet?

<h2>The next level of Sports Utility Transportation</h2>
<p>It all started on one of our many surf trips to Hourtin Plage by the Atlantic Coast. Tired of carrying our surf boards and gear to the beach we built our own surfboard trailer using a windsurf bow, old bike wheels and a tarpaulin. After receiving many envious looks and positive feedback we just had to take our idea further.</p>

<p>Back home we developed the first reacha prototype in cooperation with a bunch of creative minds.<br/>Our friends at auswall in Tegernsee made it possible to take our prototype to the next level.

<h2>about reacha</h2>
<h3>the features</h3>
<p>The reacha consists of an extremely stable frame, trunk (I don’t think this is the right word, but I don’t know what to use instead) and adjustable bike wheels. The aluminium frame is produced in Bavaria. You can customize reacha with wheels from 20 to 28 inches. This makes it suitable for all kinds of sports and terrains. It allows you to transport any kind of equipment like several surf boards, stand up paddle boards, canoes and kitesurf equipment. Optional fat bike wheels help your reacha become even more stable.</p>
<p>The maximum load capacity for reacha is 45 kg when attached to a bike and 60 kg when used as a hand trailer.</p>

<h2>accessory</h2>
<p>our reacha accessory will upgrade your reacha and adjust it to your needs even better. From our reacha bike connector to our expansion options - we've really thought it through!</p>
<h3>bike connector</h3>
<p>Our optional reacha bike connector makes it possible to pull the trailer with a bike. You can attach reacha to any bike in less than a second. No annoying tucking-the-board-under-your-arm while riding your bike! With the bike connector and our 22"" - 26"" reacha wheel options you're ready to roll. </p>
<p>You won't need an additional adapter, the bike connector is material-friendly and compatible with any bike.</p>

<h3>bow</h3>
<p>the bow makes sure that your equipment always stays safe! If you want to transport several surf or SUP boards - or your little kids that do not feel like walking all the way to the beach anymore - the reacha bow is the stabilizer in our reacha family.<br/>(We will activate this perk later during the campaign.)</p>

<h3><strong>XL kit</strong></h3>
<p>The XL kit allows you to widen the reacha for bigger adventures: How about just bringing your canoe or kayak right to where you want to start your journey on the water? Or just load your reacha with up to six surf boards.</p>
<p>With the XL kit you get 1 meter of reacha loading area - in case you were planning on opening a surf school - this is the right accessory for your plan! <br/>(We will activate this perk later during the campaign.)</p>

It all started on one of our many surf trips to Hourtin Plage by the Atlantic Coast. Tired of carrying our surf boards and gear to the beach we built our own surfboard trailer using a windsurf bow, old bike wheels and a tarpaulin. After receiving many envious looks and positive feedback we just had to take our idea further.

Back home we developed the first reacha prototype in cooperation with a bunch of creative minds.Our friends at auswall in Tegernsee made it possible to take our prototype to the next level. With extensive experience in ergonomics, design and technology we could not wish for better partners in crime.
Being the sports lovers that we are, our mission is to take the drag out of sports utility transportation. It would be amazing to see our baby go into serial production, so a huge thank you to everyone who wants to support us during this journey!

<h3>WORK &amp; JOURNEY is all you need!</h3>
<p>You may ask us why? Well the answer is below.</p>
<p>The idea of our mobile application occured once we were through our own journey. We were run out of our money and we were about to earn some extra cash to finish our trip. We found out that looking for a small jobs around the world is a bit difficult challenge. Walking from house to house takes too much time when you have your trip planned. Also we found out that there is no such application on the market. This inspired us to introduce mobile application like this.</p>

With our application you will have a chance for both. You will see job offers in your neighbourhood on a map. It is your decision to choose which of them you want to do and which are not interesting.

Use our heads and they can stay mounted on the tripod even with the legs inverted - keeping it still just 20 inches long!

We love gear that stays out of our way. The SWAP System uses a 75mm half ball with quick release clamp so changing heads is effortless.
There’s even an adapter plate so you can convert your other ⅜” heads and accessories to the SWAP System.

Switching to your jib or slider is so easy it’ll bring a smile to your face. 

You can even swap the heads from the tripod to the top of your jib and slider. 

Fast feels good!
Instead of spending time re-configuring gear, you can focus on making a great film.
There are universal, quick release anti-twist plates that work on just about any camera. And they don’t block your camera’s battery door. So satisfying.

We also include cleaning and waste removal so you don't have to worry about much as a guest using this incredibly convenient service.</p>

<p><strong>So what is a Camper Trailer? </strong>A travel trailer or camper trailer is towed behind a road vehicle to provide a place to sleep which is more comfortable and protected than a tent (although there are fold-down trailer tents). </p>

<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>How We Do It All</h3>
<div>How do we achieve all this? You may think we have invested in a thousand campers nationwide and hired drivers to deliver them in various locations across the U.S. That is not the case. Instead, we utilize a growing army of camper owners to form what we call a ""Delivery Network."" Each day we are signing on new Camper Delivery Providers who deliver and set up their own Travel Campers for customers. That's right, we use the very people who own and pay the bills on their own campers, enabling them turn their Campers into assets and make money on them when they are not using them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are over 9 million RV owners in the U.S. today, and most languish in driveways and yards and go unused most of the time. What we are doing is handpicking the best quality Travel Campers out there and their committed owners to join our network so they can make money on them as Camper Delivery Providers as part of our National Delivery Network.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPC8CYpYbVE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div></div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Our Technological Plans</strong></h3>
<div>How is technology going to shape our success in the future?</div>
<div>Well, what if you could sit down on a park bench during a break, touch a button and be able to easily and quickly request a camper delivery for the future? Within 24 hours of you submitting the dates, # of guests, destination address where you want it and other pertinent info you receive a quote through the app. And in that quote is included images of your pre-ordered camper along with the photo and short bio of the person delivering it? Their track record, camper ownership history, maybe even a blurb about their #1 camping spot or outdoor/camp food. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So you review the info, agree that the quote is fair and maybe even think about picking up the recipe to replicate the Camper Owners favorite dish. Then you press a button and book it. Your payment is processed before you can blink, you receive a confirmation email with the service request form attached, receipt, and you still have 15 minutes left on your break.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQ46zGT1b7U?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>Transparency </strong></p>
<p>As the days pass and your Camper rental delivery date inches closer, the mobile app will remind you of certain things:</p>
<p>1. What to bring for supplies</p>
<p>2. What to pack</p>
<p>3. What the camper is stocked with</p>
<p>4. Camper amenities</p>
<p><strong>You have a busy life and may forget certain things. So as you get within 24 hours of delivery:</strong></p>
<p>1. Message is sent giving you the camper owners contact # so that you may communicate if it is needed.</p>
<p>2. Receive ETA (estimated time of arrival) information via a real time message board built inside the app.</p>
<p>3. The same goes for pickup and messages sent regarding ETOP (Estimated Time Of Pickup) </p>
<p>4. Any other pertinent reminders they should stay informed on.</p>
<p>5. Finally, after the service is completed within 24 hours a final short text message (survey) is sent to the customer asking how their experience was. This enables us to track performance. </p>
<p><b>Customer Service For Camper Delivery</b></p>
<p>During the entire Delivery service process, the customer will have all the answers in the palm of their hand. They can:</p>
<p>1. Track the Campers location real time using GPS</p>
<p>2. Stay informed as to any delays and changes that will be sent via the app message board </p>
<p>3. Have a direct link to the camper owner at all times</p>
<p>4. Prevent any disconnects with communication, expectations or feelings of the unknown</p>
<p><strong>Provider Performance Tracking</strong></p>
<p>The more services we run, the more important it's going to be to store, track and use the data related to each Delivery Provider. Are they on time? Do they have a history of not showing up? How do they handle the customer? Is the camper the same quality as described and shown in images? Did they cause damage to the guests property? All this information must have a place to be stored and protected so that we can properly manage our delivery network moving forward.  In time, we hope to create algorithms for this data that can be used to produce real time ""Service Ratings"" for each provider where we can use it to prioritize them when it comes to service selection. </p>

<h3>Why We Do This</h3>
<p>We are a company that has chosen to work hard for important causes as part of our Mission Statement. We contribute to Veterans Groups, the American Cancer Society, The Humane Society, The Aids Healthcare Foundation and more.  We contribute by creating our own professional, premium content Videos for charity. These videos are designed by us and donated so that these causes and charities can use them to help spread awareness about important issues or to spur donations to allow that group to flourish and continue their mission. Here are a few that we have created and donated in order to raise awareness and donations:</p>

</div>
<h3>Campin' For A Cause</h3>
<div>Starting this year our Camper Delivery Providers will be donating their campers at their choosing for children and adults suffering from life threatening or debilitating illnesses, as well as disabled veterans and the homeless.  The campers will be delivered and set up at campgrounds and private land areas across America to provide refuge, solace and comfort with their friends and families in the quiet setting of nature.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Our Pledge:</strong> For every Camper Owner who donates their Camper for a period of time, we will create and donate one 45 second video ad to their favorite cause to help bring awareness and donations.  We will help spread this awareness by showing the videos on social media and through other outlets.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550806240/sqdwqwwsybyn4lg5ycey.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Why Invest In Us?</h3>
<p>First, we are going to be around for a long time and everything we do is based on growth. We offer a unique and groundbreaking service that helps many people and has the potential to help many more. We are light years ahead of anyone else.  As for technology, we are offering a first of its kind innovation that will change the way we view campers and how we use them. We just need the resources to accomplish all this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Technological Investment plans for Camper Delivery orders that provide transparency for all users and a game changing breakthroughs in customer satisfaction.</li>
<li>Camper Owners: This service allows camper owners to turn their RV's into an asset. It produces income and has the capacity to even make it a business for themselves. </li>
<li>The Customer: The people who are renting these and having them delivered are afforded an amazing convenience for themselves and their families. Whether they are going to their homes so they can stay close while remodeling is being done or to a campground, this service offers them a chance to save money and spend more time with their families. </li>
<li>Charitable Causes: As we grow so will our charitable contributions, we are committed to doing good and helping people. We are huge believers in taking care of one another and in the idea that in life, it isn't about how much money we make but how we treat people. </li>
</ul>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mX0Hb0Rvu0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Our Challenges:</strong></h3>
<p>Our biggest challenges remain in three areas: Advertising, Technology and Infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Advertising/National Exposure</strong></p>
<p>This service is a new and big idea that few people have heard of. So our biggest challenge above anything else is making people aware that our service even exists. This will require a substantial Marketing budget, which we are seeking by utilizing this platform. The funds are needed to invest in more Google Ads/SEO as well as a substantial increase in our Social Media campaign spending. </p>
<p><strong>Technology: Mobile App </strong></p>
<p>The second challenge is ensuring we innovate and build the technology that we need in order to grow properly and maximize efficiencies. The majority of our technology budget must go to the build and implementation of a mobile app where customers can order a Camper Delivery easily from anywhere in the same manner we order a pizza. We also need website improvements and and enhancements in order to maximize functionality and user efficiency for our customers.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure: In-house Data System/Platform</strong></p>
<p>We need to build a place to store, track and protect our information. As we grow, we will be adding more data that will need to be organized and made transparent. Our goal is to have the ability to store all information from each delivery from the gross revenue to profit, and Provider Performance Metrics that will enable us to closely track how our providers perform. In the future, we hope to assign service metric scores for each provider that will include ETA accuracy, Camper Quality, CSI (Customer Service Index) and Complaint Ratios. </p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxFGR0i-62E?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Final Pitch: What You Get</h3>
<p>You will find there are numerous perks listed with incredible deals that you will not find anywhere but here. This service is valuable and convenient for many families across America but few know we exist. There is little or no competition in this market but it will not be long before more companies catch on and begin imitating our strategy and business model. While we are on the trajectory of growth, we need more help to expand faster, gain a strong tech advantage and bring exposure to our wonderful service to many more people. </p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your contributions. And if you need anything or have a question, please feel free to call me directly. I am always here for you. </p>

7. Full Cleaning. You are not required to thoroughly clean the camper, we handle that.
8. Waste removal. We remove the waste from the black and gray tanks safely and by code.
 


 

How We Do It All
How do we achieve all this? You may think we have invested in a thousand campers nationwide and hired drivers to deliver them in various locations across the U.S. That is not the case. Instead, we utilize a growing army of camper owners to form what we call a ""Delivery Network."" Each day we are signing on new Camper Delivery Providers who deliver and set up their own Travel Campers for customers. That's right, we use the very people who own and pay the bills on their own campers, enabling them turn their Campers into assets and make money on them when they are not using them.
 
There are over 9 million RV owners in the U.S. today, and most languish in driveways and yards and go unused most of the time. What we are doing is handpicking the best quality Travel Campers out there and their committed owners to join our network so they can make money on them as Camper Delivery Providers as part of our National Delivery Network.
 

 
Our Technological Plans
How is technology going to shape our success in the future?
Well, what if you could sit down on a park bench during a break, touch a button and be able to easily and quickly request a camper delivery for the future? Within 24 hours of you submitting the dates, # of guests, destination address where you want it and other pertinent info you receive a quote through the app. And in that quote is included images of your pre-ordered camper along with the photo and short bio of the person delivering it? Their track record, camper ownership history, maybe even a blurb about their #1 camping spot or outdoor/camp food. 
 
So you review the info, agree that the quote is fair and maybe even think about picking up the recipe to replicate the Camper Owners favorite dish. Then you press a button and book it. Your payment is processed before you can blink, you receive a confirmation email with the service request form attached, receipt, and you still have 15 minutes left on your break.
 


 

Transparency 
As the days pass and your Camper rental delivery date inches closer, the mobile app will remind you of certain things:
1. What to bring for supplies
2. What to pack
3. What the camper is stocked with
4. Camper amenities
You have a busy life and may forget certain things. So as you get within 24 hours of delivery:
1. Message is sent giving you the camper owners contact # so that you may communicate if it is needed.
2. Receive ETA (estimated time of arrival) information via a real time message board built inside the app.
3. The same goes for pickup and messages sent regarding ETOP (Estimated Time Of Pickup) 
4. Any other pertinent reminders they should stay informed on.
5. Finally, after the service is completed within 24 hours a final short text message (survey) is sent to the customer asking how their experience was. This enables us to track performance. 
Customer Service For Camper Delivery
During the entire Delivery service process, the customer will have all the answers in the palm of their hand. They can:
1. Track the Campers location real time using GPS
2. Stay informed as to any delays and changes that will be sent via the app message board 
3. Have a direct link to the camper owner at all times
4. Prevent any disconnects with communication, expectations or feelings of the unknown
Provider Performance Tracking
The more services we run, the more important it's going to be to store, track and use the data related to each Delivery Provider. Are they on time? Do they have a history of not showing up? How do they handle the customer? Is the camper the same quality as described and shown in images? Did they cause damage to the guests property? All this information must have a place to be stored and protected so that we can properly manage our delivery network moving forward.  In time, we hope to create algorithms for this data that can be used to produce real time ""Service Ratings"" for each provider where we can use it to prioritize them when it comes to service selection. 
 


 

Why We Do This
We are a company that has chosen to work hard for important causes as part of our Mission Statement. We contribute to Veterans Groups, the American Cancer Society, The Humane Society, The Aids Healthcare Foundation and more.  We contribute by creating our own professional, premium content Videos for charity. These videos are designed by us and donated so that these causes and charities can use them to help spread awareness about important issues or to spur donations to allow that group to flourish and continue their mission. Here are a few that we have created and donated in order to raise awareness and donations:


 


 


Campin' For A Cause
Starting this year our Camper Delivery Providers will be donating their campers at their choosing for children and adults suffering from life threatening or debilitating illnesses, as well as disabled veterans and the homeless.  The campers will be delivered and set up at campgrounds and private land areas across America to provide refuge, solace and comfort with their friends and families in the quiet setting of nature.
 
Our Pledge: For every Camper Owner who donates their Camper for a period of time, we will create and donate one 45 second video ad to their favorite cause to help bring awareness and donations.  We will help spread this awareness by showing the videos on social media and through other outlets.  

Why Invest In Us?
First, we are going to be around for a long time and everything we do is based on growth. We offer a unique and groundbreaking service that helps many people and has the potential to help many more. We are light years ahead of anyone else.  As for technology, we are offering a first of its kind innovation that will change the way we view campers and how we use them. We just need the resources to accomplish all this.

Technological Investment plans for Camper Delivery orders that provide transparency for all users and a game changing breakthroughs in customer satisfaction.
Camper Owners: This service allows camper owners to turn their RV's into an asset. It produces income and has the capacity to even make it a business for themselves. 
The Customer: The people who are renting these and having them delivered are afforded an amazing convenience for themselves and their families. Whether they are going to their homes so they can stay close while remodeling is being done or to a campground, this service offers them a chance to save money and spend more time with their families. 
Charitable Causes: As we grow so will our charitable contributions, we are committed to doing good and helping people. We are huge believers in taking care of one another and in the idea that in life, it isn't about how much money we make but how we treat people. 


 
Our Challenges:
Our biggest challenges remain in three areas: Advertising, Technology and Infrastructure.
Advertising/National Exposure
This service is a new and big idea that few people have heard of. So our biggest challenge above anything else is making people aware that our service even exists. This will require a substantial Marketing budget, which we are seeking by utilizing this platform. The funds are needed to invest in more Google Ads/SEO as well as a substantial increase in our Social Media campaign spending. 
Technology: Mobile App 
The second challenge is ensuring we innovate and build the technology that we need in order to grow properly and maximize efficiencies. The majority of our technology budget must go to the build and implementation of a mobile app where customers can order a Camper Delivery easily from anywhere in the same manner we order a pizza. We also need website improvements and and enhancements in order to maximize functionality and user efficiency for our customers.
Infrastructure: In-house Data System/Platform
We need to build a place to store, track and protect our information. As we grow, we will be adding more data that will need to be organized and made transparent. Our goal is to have the ability to store all information from each delivery from the gross revenue to profit, and Provider Performance Metrics that will enable us to closely track how our providers perform. In the future, we hope to assign service metric scores for each provider that will include ETA accuracy, Camper Quality, CSI (Customer Service Index) and Complaint Ratios. 
 

 
Our Final Pitch: What You Get
You will find there are numerous perks listed with incredible deals that you will not find anywhere but here. This service is valuable and convenient for many families across America but few know we exist. There is little or no competition in this market but it will not be long before more companies catch on and begin imitating our strategy and business model. While we are on the trajectory of growth, we need more help to expand faster, gain a strong tech advantage and bring exposure to our wonderful service to many more people. 
Thank you very much in advance for your contributions. And if you need anything or have a question, please feel free to call me directly. I am always here for you. 
Warmly,

<h1><strong>The Ultimate Adventure Pack</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Top Grain, Roll-Top Leather Backpack</strong></p>
<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p><strong>We are Kodiak Leather</strong> (<a href=""http://kodiakleather.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kodiakleather.com</a>), a startup in Lehi, Utah founded by Jared Morse, an outdoorsman who was frustrated by the lack of reasonably priced leather bags that would hold up through all the wear and tear of daily use. This inspired Jared to create Kodiak Leather and our custom leather bags. After finding only the highest quality leather and hardware, we set out to build a bag that would last a lifetime. </p>
<p><strong>Fast Forward 3 1/2 Years...</strong></p>
<p>After having 3 successful Kickstarter campaigns, the <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/886384381/kodiak-leather-buffalo-leather-satchel-briefcase-w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buffalo Leather Satchel</a>, T<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/886384381/kodiak-leather-classic-weekender-duffel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">he Classic Weekender Duffel</a>, and our most recent <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/886384381/sitka-leather-messenger-a-bag-for-cameras-and-ever"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sitka Leather Messenger</a>, we have come full circle on offering a wide variety of travel bags (mainly duffel bags), briefcases (similar to the satchel and the messenger), as well as some smaller, everyday carry items. </p>
<p>We have had countless insights on product design, future product offerings, and functionality suggestions from our nearly <strong>2700</strong> previous backers.  </p>
<p>We have had many requests over the last couple of years to produce a leather backpack, that kept the rugged, adventure-ready Kodiak Leather look and feel, while maintaining functionality and a reasonable price point.</p>
<p>Well..  We are happy to introduce the <strong>Kobuk Roll-Top Leather Backpack.</strong></p>

<p>This design was inspired by a roll-top leather duffel bag we came across that was super functional (could handle a good amount of gear), and had a bulletproof look about it.</p>
<h1><strong>The Kobuk Roll-Top Backpack was designed with functionality, durability and simplicity in mind.</strong></h1>
<p>True to Kodiak Leather form, we wanted this bag to have the same ""Alaska - Ready"" look to it,  while being able to accommodate a wide variety of daily uses and individuals.</p>

The Ultimate Adventure Pack
Top Grain, Roll-Top Leather Backpack
Our Story
We are Kodiak Leather (www.kodiakleather.com), a startup in Lehi, Utah founded by Jared Morse, an outdoorsman who was frustrated by the lack of reasonably priced leather bags that would hold up through all the wear and tear of daily use. This inspired Jared to create Kodiak Leather and our custom leather bags. After finding only the highest quality leather and hardware, we set out to build a bag that would last a lifetime. 
Fast Forward 3 1/2 Years...
After having 3 successful Kickstarter campaigns, the Buffalo Leather Satchel, The Classic Weekender Duffel, and our most recent Sitka Leather Messenger, we have come full circle on offering a wide variety of travel bags (mainly duffel bags), briefcases (similar to the satchel and the messenger), as well as some smaller, everyday carry items. 
We have had countless insights on product design, future product offerings, and functionality suggestions from our nearly 2700 previous backers.  
We have had many requests over the last couple of years to produce a leather backpack, that kept the rugged, adventure-ready Kodiak Leather look and feel, while maintaining functionality and a reasonable price point.
Well..  We are happy to introduce the Kobuk Roll-Top Leather Backpack.

This design was inspired by a roll-top leather duffel bag we came across that was super functional (could handle a good amount of gear), and had a bulletproof look about it.
The Kobuk Roll-Top Backpack was designed with functionality, durability and simplicity in mind.
True to Kodiak Leather form, we wanted this bag to have the same ""Alaska - Ready"" look to it,  while being able to accommodate a wide variety of daily uses and individuals.

Whether you’re headed up to the mountains for a hike, taking it to the office, or packing this to class,  this pack was designed with you in mind!

</div></div>","Welcome to your unexpected journey 
Hello and welcome to the Park of Fantasy!
The Park of Fantasy is a dream dreamed by a small group of visionaries. We want to give you the chance to dive into a world full of fantasy. We are a Team of seven persons who want to create an adventure park which includes a holiday resort. The most of us are passionate fantasy fans, LARP player or cosplayer. Others are more intrested into videogames, literature, photo- and filmography. Together we want to bring YOU the complete feeling of living in a fantastic world!
 
What is the campaign about?
 
Our campaign is all about funding the Park of Fantasy in Hungary, Europe. The Park of Fantasy is an adventure world with different accommodations to rent and a big variety of leisure activities. The Park of Fantasy  will be a pure LARP (Live Action Role Play) and Archery/Crossbow project, at first. This means that in the first time we'll have tents in different sizes and comforts. Also we will have guesting houses, an archery and crossbow - shootingrange and an Archery Attack™ -field.
Archery Attack™
 

 
Later on, the different offers for animations, such as:

horse riding
swimming,
boat rentals,
blacksmithing,
swordplay, etc.,

and also events, such as big LARPs, festivals, e.t.c., will follow.
Also we'll start to build up rental houses next to the tents. There will also be different sizes and comfort standarts for the houses.
Please visit our Website for further informations. Thank you!
Vision for the Park of Fantasy in 2019

 
What do we need your financial help for?
 
With your financial help we want to collect an amount of 320'000 € for the first part of the Park of Fantasy, which includes:


120 different tents in different comfort standarts
2 guesting houses
the shooting range
the Archery Attack™ - field and the Archery Attack™ equiptment
the LARP fields
decorations for the fields
the staff

 

 
What happens if the funding goal won't be reached?
If we can't collect the 320'000 €, all your promised funds will not be debited from your bank accounts. If we can't reach the fund goal the whole project will be cancelled.
 
 

 
What are our thoughts behind the Park of Fantasy?
 
Together with you, we want to create one of the biggest LARP-, Fantasy- and Cosplay communities. We want to bring together all the fans of our planet and we want to give you and us the opportunity to live our passion with like-minded people in an authentic place.

<p>About this project</p>
<p>SAVIOR,  is the world’s 1st titanium double-sided screwdriver including bottle opener with its titanium key ring. After all successful design and manufacturing stages it is finally ready to show you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We aimed to produce a strong, compact and versatile EDC (every day carry) tool which can be a savior when you have it and makes your daily things easier. In order to be successful, we firstly focused on people’s daily life. By doing so we obtained the knowledge of what kind of things they mostly face with every day. Then according to this knowledge the design and prototype stages were started and finalized successfully.</p>
<p>SAVIOR, attached to a titanium key ring, is the world’s most compact, brilliant and multipurpose titanium tool which will be a savior in your pocket!</p>
<p>PRODUCT INFORMATION</p>
<p>Material: Titanium Grade 5 has high strength, low weight ratio and outstanding corrosion resistance. Thus we used Titanium Grade 5 for Savior </p>
<p>Weight: Since SAVIOR is made from titanium it is very light, 6 gr.</p>
<p>5 axes CNC milling machine is used to manufacture each SAVIOR which enables use to produce them at minimal time and maximum quality. Then, sandblasting is used in order to obtain a visually better product. We quarantee our backers by providing them SAVIOR at minimal time, maximum material, manufacturing and visual quality.</p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>We simplified manufacturing of SAVIOR very much by using 5 axes CNC milling machine. Since it cuts rapidly with a good quality, we do not have a time problem. Only some machining malfunctions and some other production related mishaps can slightly delay production. However, since we planned our existing production plan as including such slight delays, we feel very confident that your SAVIOR will be on your pocket on time.</p>

Many times we would be in the same campground. Sometimes even within a couple of spots. We have been in the middle of the desert and was parked next to one of our friends on Instagram and didn't know until the 3rd day after changing our Wi-Fi SSID to our Instagram name and they saw it.</p><p>For the last 2 years we have been working on a social media platform that would solve this problem. We call it Fernweh. A feeling of homesickness for places you've never been. This community will help travelers come to together, share their travels, and connect in a more real way than other social media platforms allow.</p><h3> </h3><h3>The Plan </h3><p>We are currently in Phase 2 which is the most crucial phase of the launch. For the Fernweh platform to succeed and grow as a top community platform it will need to be turned into an app and be heavy marketed. The framework for the app build is fully ready and the marketing plan is set up.  Both teams are ready to push hard and take Fernweh to the next level. </p><p>The App will take approximately 3 to 5 days to be in testing phase and about  1 week to be in the Google Play and Apple store and ready to use. It will sync with the website so members can switch devices with no issues.  The cost of the app development will cost just over $1,400 one time fee and monthly $500 for hosting and maintenance. We will also need to switch to a dedicated hosting server for the website and database to handle the influx of members and to scale the server size easily without any downtime. The dedicated server cost starts out at $200 a month. </p><p>Marketing will be done through Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and LinkedIn.  Marketing budget depends on the amount of funding we receive. The more marketing budget we have the harder we can push which will allow us to get in front of the most people. Our minimum marketing goal is $5,000.</p><p>We have set our overall goal to $15,000.

That’s what the Kids Adventure Games creates with each of its races: An exceptional kids event with far reaching, lifelong lessons.

When their twins were born it became a passion to create experiences that would be fun for their kids and friends. Just like Walt Disney, who himself was out with his children and had a revelation and an idea on how he could create experiences for children and families that would transform their lives.</p><p>And so, starting with their twins' 1st birthday party, The Mattisons made it an annual event to design an adventure course for their kids and friends. First in their backyard and later in a local campground, set in mountainous and snow covered terrain, early November, every year. Adding zip lines, biking, hiking, cargo nets, rappelling, rafting and orienteering over the years, the vision for the Kids Adventure Games began taking shape. </p><p>In the kids' kindergarten year, The Mattisons approached the Town of Vail Recreation District about co-producing an annual event during the summer months. With only 50 spots available as a single day event in its inaugural year, it was wildly successful. Within 4 years, the event grew into a 5 day festival with multiple length courses and skills clinics, with over 1200 kids vying for a spot. Trying a few additional markets between 2014 and 2019, the Kids Adventure Games is a proven concept and the groundwork is laid for a larger vision.</p><p> </p><div>

We feel a great responsibility on course but also for the impact the experience has on our athletes, parents, grandparents, non-participatory spectators, staff, volunteers, and our alumnis.Young people are 40% of the population but they are 100% of our future. We aim to encourage children to become independent thinkers, expand their vision and show them their worth. With your support and generosity, we can continue this journey. Please read below about our past, present and our future strategic vision, our challenges, our goals and how we plan to get there.        Thank you for reading, sharing with your network and contributing to the future of the Kids Adventure Games.                     “Priceless. The sense of achievement I felt from my kids made me so very proud. A really great, unique event"" Big Sky Mom                                              ""Magic in Motion"" Our mission is to make an impact globally, encouraging kids to ""Be an Outsider"" and ""Thrive Outside"", inspiring them to set goals and go way further than what they think they can do. Mainly though, we want the kids to have fun. Combine the two and you have the recipe for 'The Kids Adventure Games'. We are looking to raise funds for marketing, operations and expanding into additional markets.  The EventThe Kids Adventure Games offers kids, ages 6 through 14, the opportunity to experience the thrill of adventure racing.  During the race, teams of two will work together to navigate a variety of sports and problem-solving challenges, hiking, tubing, archery, a ropes course, a zip line, a climbing wall, a Tarzan swing, a giant slip-n-slide and more, all the while studying their map to get through the course in the fastest possible time. The races emphasize teamwork, problem solving, sportsmanship, environmental awareness and fun. The kids cross the finish line, muddy, sweaty, smiling and full of pride.   UniqueThere is no other race like this in the world.  The sport of Obstacle Racing attracted 6,000,000 adult weekend warriors in 2019. Globally the numbers are thought to reach over 20,000,000 and growing rapidly.In this space, The Kids Adventure Games is the only event of this kind. We are not just an obstacle course: we identify as an adventure race which is a multidisciplinary team sport where kids follow a map to pass through checkpoints and which involve adventurous obstacles inspired by the wilderness terrain.The race will encourage team independence as family members will only be allowed to spectate and watch as the teams of two navigate the course. “Part of the fun will be to allow the kids to take ownership of the race and do it themselves,” said Mattison. “We’ll have plenty of checkpoints, aid stations and course marshals to help as needed.”Parents understand this recipe for success: to be challenged yet have fun, be determined, develop good character, sportsmanship, teamwork, build grit and resilience, be able to think on your feet and finish the day with a smile. That’s what the Kids Adventure Games creates with each of its races: An exceptional kids event with far reaching, lifelong lessons. The Kids Adventure Games builds community and encourages environmental stewardship.  Our StoryEver since our founders, Billy and Hélène  Mattison, met in Meribel, France they have managed to breathe adventure into every aspect of their lives. When their twins were born it became a passion to create experiences that would be fun for their kids and friends. Just like Walt Disney, who himself was out with his children and had a revelation and an idea on how he could create experiences for children and families that would transform their lives.And so, starting with their twins' 1st birthday party, The Mattisons made it an annual event to design an adventure course for their kids and friends. First in their backyard and later in a local campground, set in mountainous and snow covered terrain, early November, every year. Adding zip lines, biking, hiking, cargo nets, rappelling, rafting and orienteering over the years, the vision for the Kids Adventure Games began taking shape. In the kids' kindergarten year, The Mattisons approached the Town of Vail Recreation District about co-producing an annual event during the summer months. With only 50 spots available as a single day event in its inaugural year, it was wildly successful. Within 4 years, the event grew into a 5 day festival with multiple length courses and skills clinics, with over 1200 kids vying for a spot. Trying a few additional markets between 2014 and 2019, the Kids Adventure Games is a proven concept and the groundwork is laid for a larger vision. 

 
""Dear Helene and the KAG team!This event is SO AWESOME! Teagan and Eli (Coed 8-9 year old category) had THE BEST TIME! They loved every minute of the race and we loved seeing them push themselves and support each other along the route. We love how this event promotes and teaches the kids about what it means to work as a team and support others…and how to overcome obstacles. It teaches them about sportsmanship and being mindful of their environment. Both kids walked away from the event feeling proud of their accomplishments and excited to try new and exciting things.Thank you very much for your hard work and dedication to this event! WE LOVE IT!Haley & Scott Kelly; (Teagan’s parents); Park City, UT""  ChallengesMarketing and Advertising: Our largest challenge is raising awareness of the event. Up until this point, we have primarily grown via word of mouth. In order to achieve our goal of reaching more kids we need to increase visibility of the event through a media campaign, and strategic partnerships.Operations: Traveling nationwide with all of our equipment is tough on vehicle maintenance, travel cost and long hours of driving. To be able to alleviate this we need to double our equipment and double our operations team.  ""All 4 of my girls participate every year,  and their cousins and now a many of their friends. We plan for it every year. But it was a challenge to get my 8 year old to do it, she rarely wanted to go outside. She surprised herself when finishing her first year of the Kids Adventure Games. Now 3 years later and a regular at the Stowe races, she loves her homemade, Kids Adventure Games inspired course in her backyard.""Bethany Gibson, Concord Mass.          Vision
Creating a participatory 'stay-cation' for active families in premier destinations around the world. A proven concept in the Town of Vail, CO, with 3 days of racing, 2 days of skills clinics, a Family Adventure Zone, merchandising, evening entertainment and ancillary events like an obstacle run for the whole family and a balance bike race for kids up until 5 years of age
Exploring franchising options, on a global scale
 Additionally: 
The Kids Adventure Games as a National and International Series with a World Championship as early as 2021.
An inclusive event for athletes will all abilities
Partnerships with nonprofits to engage in fundraising aspects
An internship program for college outdoor education programs. 
  The AskSelf funded for many years, with additional sponsorships, it's been mostly a labor of love. Now in our 6th year, in order to be a sustainable company and expand, we need to restructure with a first round of funding that is based on this financial model. Funding Goals in order of importance:MarketingThrough more quality and quantity visibility we can 10x our participation. ($35,000)Operations Funds towards updating our equipment like ropes, harnesses and climbing hardware. Investing in newly designed obstacles and a general face-lift of  the start/finish area and signage. ($7,500)Stretch goals: (if the target funing is reached, additional monies will be allocated toward:)
Put efforts toward expanding our reach to the Eastern Seaboard and Southern States. This would mean building an additional team, as well as doubling our equipment to increase the number  of events we are able to put on. 
Put efforts toward franchising and licensing the event.
