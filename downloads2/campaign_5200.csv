The Story:
The grandeur and spirit of the Olympic Games is one that
inspires the imagination, at times sends chills over oneâ€™s body. The images
that come to mind are athletes on the podiums, shots of crossing finish lines,
celebrations of a team reaching their goals, the trials and tribulations of the
struggles and successes of the athletes. Now, we see another side of the gamesâ€¦ images of the stage
for the Olympics being built, scaffolding lined with workers, the unsafe work
conditions. There are pictures of the squalor of the migrant workers on the
construction sites, sequences of their long journeys from home and the
hardships endured.

We look to the second principle in the Fundamental
Principles of Olympism,
the Olympic Charter states that:  â€œThe goal of Olympism is to place sport at
the service of the harmonious development of man, with a view to promoting a
peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity.â€ 

Tajikistan
is a country that once formed part of the Soviet Union. Today it is one of the most migration-dependent countries in the
world. Traditionally, it is a country with a surplus labor force and is
increasing each year. The unemployment rate is currently at 40%.
Economic desperation and high unemployment rates have forced 800,000 to
migrate, with unofficial figures standing as high as 1.5 million people. 

Russia
is a primary destination country for migrants from Tajikistan due to
familiarity with language, labor needs and ease on work visas. Although this
familiarity is helpful, Tajiks suffer many abuses along their journeys to
Russia and once they have arrived to their final destinations. In order to
increase migrant communitiesâ€™ influence in protection of their own rights,
there is a need for self-empowerment. Despite existing benefits of unions and
organized groups to advocate for improved conditions, there is limited
organizing among migrants from Tajikistan. 



 


The Plan:

This
phase of the project begins in March-April of 2012, a month after Zamira has
established her in-country investigation in Tajikistan. Rut plans on joining
Zamira to support her efforts by documenting the work (film + photography) and
starting to work with migrants who have already been recruited to travel to
Sochi. Once in Tajikistan, we will have class twice a week with support from
local migrant support organizations. 
After
several weeks of training, and as migrants start to leave for the work season,
we will go to Sochi to meet back with the migrants we trained in Tajikistan. If
the conditions are favorable in Sochi (Phase II of the project) we look to
expand the project and create some footage for short clips to be used by
international awareness organizations. Once finished in Sochi, we plan on
returning to the States to put together a photo series of the images created by
the migrants and short video clips to further support their efforts.


 
The Need:

Here is the deal... We need over $15,000 to get this project underway and be able to be in Tajikistan by April to begin classes before the migrants leave for Russia.

What needs to happen before all of this is: gathering cameras (for migrants to  use) and related equipment, applying for travel visas, obtaining permits to  travel with the equipment and purchasing the travel tickets. So, this  contribution will pay for these items, as well as in-country expenses such as rental  of spaces to hold workshops, photography materials for migrants to work  with, translation services and computer use, communication expenses to get the word out, room and board in Russia (in Tajikistan we would rely on  friends and family).

We know that this is a rich story with the Olympic element, but it is difficult to raise money from foundations at this stage of the game. We are reaching out for help from PEOPLE LIKE YOU â€“ people who love the challenging stories intermingled with the arts and believe in people being triumphant. Your money will help fund photography, graphic design and other organizing/ advocacy workshops for Tajik migrants and get enough photographs to create a larger story, which are the elements that foundations like to see before placing their support.

Our total cost for the entire project - complete with the final creation of the report, supporting images to create a photo journal, exhibits and  short clips of video footage - is over $60,000, so all of this IndieGoGo money is vital for our ability to make this happen.
 
*We will send a financial report to all contributors upon completion of the project.

<h3>Tom Adam Photography</h3>
</div>
<div>I've spent years working in IT for somebody else, and could only do photography in my ""free time.""  As I thought about what makes me happy, I realized how much more fulfilled I feel helping people document their special moments, particularly their weddings.  A photograph is not just something you put in a book, or even on a wall; it should be a time-machine that takes you back to that moment - the sights, smells, and emotions of that unique time.  It can also become complete personalized art.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With hearts in our throats, my wife and I are looking to expand to a full time photography business. We're so proud of the work we've done so far, which you can see at <a href=""http://www.tomadamphotography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tom Adam Photography</a> (weddings/fashion portraits) and <a href=""http://www.amberjannusch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Life in Motion by Amber</a> (portraits/lifestyle).  But to go further and produce the highest quality images and products, we need to add and upgrade equipment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for your support to help us upgrade our equipment.  Our goal of $3500 will help us purchase our primary camera body - a Canon 5diii.  Any additional funds will help us get additional lenses and professional lighting equipment.</p>
<p>As a thank-you for your support and belief in our talents, we would like to provide you with some of the fine art photographs I have taken, or even do a portrait session or wedding with you, if you live in the Eastern Iowa area. (Heck, if you're willing to pay travel expenses, we'll come do your shoot ANYWHERE.)</p>
<p>You can see some of the fine art pictures <a href=""http://tomadamphotography.smugmug.com/FineArtPrints/Fine-Art/23920106_r73pBD#!i=1940620226&amp;k=TQz78VV"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Tom Adam fine art"">here</a>.</p>

I've spent years working in IT for somebody else, and could only do photography in my ""free time.""  As I thought about what makes me happy, I realized how much more fulfilled I feel helping people document their special moments, particularly their weddings.  A photograph is not just something you put in a book, or even on a wall; it should be a time-machine that takes you back to that moment - the sights, smells, and emotions of that unique time.  It can also become complete personalized art.
 
With hearts in our throats, my wife and I are looking to expand to a full time photography business. We're so proud of the work we've done so far, which you can see at Tom Adam Photography (weddings/fashion portraits) and Life in Motion by Amber (portraits/lifestyle).  But to go further and produce the highest quality images and products, we need to add and upgrade equipment.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking for your support to help us upgrade our equipment.  Our goal of $3500 will help us purchase our primary camera body - a Canon 5diii.  Any additional funds will help us get additional lenses and professional lighting equipment.
As a thank-you for your support and belief in our talents, we would like to provide you with some of the fine art photographs I have taken, or even do a portrait session or wedding with you, if you live in the Eastern Iowa area. (Heck, if you're willing to pay travel expenses, we'll come do your shoot ANYWHERE.)
You can see some of the fine art pictures here.

<h3>Art For Shelters will give 250 paintings to New York City shelters in the next 12 months with your support.</h3>
<h3> <br/>OUR MISSION : Art For Shelters (AFS) gives the gift of art, creating a vision for social responsibility. <br/><br/>OUR PROJECT: Art For Shelters will create and donate 250 paintings to New York City Shelters in the next 12 months. <br/><br/>We donate vibrant art work to shelters, in order to inspire and uplift the spirit of victims of domestic violence and their children, victims of child abuse and sex trafficking as well as homeless teens living in shelters. Similar to the business model of our hero, (Blake Mycoskie of Toms Shoes), Art For Shelters is based on a one for one concept. For each work of art sold, artwork of equal value will be donated to a shelter. A ""special thanks"" plaque engraved with the buyer's name will accompany the donated art acknowledging their special participation. Once we meet our funding goal, we will send you images and videos via Indiegogo of the AFS team delivering the paintings to the shelters. <br/><br/>OUR FUNDING: Upon funding $40,000, we will be able to accomplish the following:<br/><br/>* create the first 25 paintings for New York City shelters<br/><br/>* purchase supplies for the remaining 225 paintings<br/><br/>* execute the public relations launch campaign<br/><br/>* launch the marketing and sales campaign for AFS<br/><br/>* launch a social media campaign for AFS<br/><br/>* transportation costs to deliver paintings to NYC shelters<br/><br/>OUR ART:</h3>
<h3>AFS will donate modern paintings by artist, Gina Raphaela, a New York City based artist and co-founder of AFS. Gina's work is held in private collections throughout the world. Her work has also been featured in publications such as VAGA and NY Arts. Her exhibit, Love or Fear, opened last month in Chelsea with Nona Hendryx. Critics hailed Gina’s exhibition: “a very fluid and provocative show."" Her constructive sculpture, Timed, “a life size figure covered with 16,000 mini-marshmallows brilliantly emphasized the universal desire to look young."" After donating 250 of Gina's paintings in the first year, AFS will bring other artists on board and expand to shelters throughout the United States. Our long-tern vision is a global operation where art is donated to shelters and orphanages around the world; as well as developing an educational project that allows Art For Shelters to bring a day of making art to the people living in these shelters. <br/><br/>OUR DREAM: By participating in our funding goal, we hope you will become inspired to look at what you have right in front of you; then create it, donate it and uplift those who need it most. Imagine how your own business or place of employment can create a one for one concept. Do it....then do a little happy dance.<br/><br/>We believe social responsibility is cool. <br/><br/>OUR PRIZES: See details of our prizes to the right and some images in gallery. After our funding goal is met, we will reach out to all of our generous supporters and obtain all details necessary to fulfill your prizes!</h3>

<p>
</p>
<p>People like Dr Dax helped
make the world a friendlier place for those of us, our friends and family
members who may experience mental ill health during our lives.</p>
<p>Dr Eric Cunningham Dax was a
pioneering psychiatrist who helped reform the mental health system in
Australia. He introduced far-reaching innovations that gave dignity and a
quality of life to patients that had previously been sadly lacking. He started
community-based services such as Lifeline - a world’s first at the time. He
fought hard against the stigma around mental illness throughout his long
career.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Dr Dax also believed in the
value of art and creativity, and initiated art programs for patients in
institutions as far back as the 1940s. He salvaged many artworks from skip bins
and rubbish heaps as the institutions closed down in the 90s - these formed the
kernel of the Cunningham Dax Collection – one that has grown to around
15,000 works today.</p>

<p>A
selection of artworks will form a survey exhibition of the Cunningham Dax
Collection, a collection of over 15,000 artworks created by people with a lived
experience of mental illness or trauma. Within the exhibition, the Collection’s
most recent acquisitions, donated by artists within the last two years, will
share the gallery space with the Collection’s most historic works, created in
psychiatric hospitals and institutions in the 1950s and 1960s, collected by
psychiatrist and founder of The Dax Centre, Dr Eric Cunningham Dax. The works
will reflect both the historic foundation of the Collection, along with it’s
continued engagement with artists and community groups today.</p>
<p>Employing
diverse media and techniques, the contemporary and historic works reveal the
artists’ raw emotional experiences, often using the physical body in various

  ► The Impact
NE Fest 1 was a test for us - whether we had the will and motivation to create something out of nothing in the name of art. We started the preparation for the festival having no money and no experience. Luckily, we met the support of the Student Council at the Art Academy in Sofia, Bulgaria who donated a small amount of money to our project. Even though it was a difficult task to accomplish, in the end, we did a great job and what is more, we learned that if you believe and work hard enough, anything is possible. 
After almost a year of constant work on the second edition of NE Fest, we are still missing the financial stability. And this time we are standing up pledging for your support. YOUR HELP WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE and contribute to the development of a new trend of art - the independent experimental art, and its evergrowing followers.
If we have a successful campaign, we will become one of the few festivals in the world and the first in Bulgaria raised by the public. 

WE RELY ON YOU!
----------
  ► Risks & Challenges  Since we have already successfully pulled off the pilot edition of the festival, we have gathered the valuable experience required to foresee and avoid many of the risks and challenges a project of this caliber implies.  The main hurdle we cannot overcome on owr own yet is securing the financial side of the festival and this was the reason we came to www.indiegogo.com to find you.
----------

► Other Ways You Can Help Even if you cannot afford funding our project, you can still help us spread the word about the festival and share our campaign and facebook page. 
(Please, use the Indiegogo share tools.)
If you like NE Fest, make sure your friends and family like it, too! :)

<h3><strong>What is Klawedis?</strong></h3>
<p>The Klawedis Project gives you the opportunity to support global artists and their communities while buying affordable art.</p>
<h3><strong>How?</strong></h3>
<p>Klawedis will source art from talented global artists and bring it to you through the Klawedis website. Buying their work gives them the exposure and compensation they need.</p>
<h3><strong>But <em>how</em> do you get the art?</strong></h3>
<p>The Klawedis Journey has two phases.</p>
<p>The first phase will rely on our travel in search of unique and undiscovered art, creating a new audience for our global artists throughout the Klawedis community. </p>
<p>The second phases enables Art Ambassadors to discover unique and authentic pieces, and share them with the larger Klawedis community. Art Ambassadors will receive a percentage of each of their discovered artists’ sales.</p>
<h3><strong>What is an Art Ambassador? </strong></h3>
<p>It could be you! Or anyone that is traveling that comes across a piece that the world needs to see. We will work with you to procure the art and give you a percentage of the sale while fully compensating the artist and giving them the opportunity to grow their audience.</p>
<h3><strong>What about the name Klawedis?</strong></h3>
<p>We picked<em> Klawedis </em>because it’s not a word in any language. It’s sidewalk spelled backwards, but also reflects how art doesn't need a language to tell a story.</p>
<h3><strong>The Inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>The <em>Klawedis</em> journey was inspired by a trip to Cozumel, Mexico. Exploring the small town we came across a back alley and walked inside a tiny shop. Inside was an incredible art studio with unique handmade pieces in all sizes. The artist was in the back creating the skull and watermelon piece shown here. We learned that he had been painting for 30 years in the same location. Unique canvas paintings inspired by the culture of Mexico, we had to buy one! Not on the main strip, he gets the occasional tourist customer but still struggles to sustain an income. We felt talent like this is often overlooked and created <em>Klawedis </em>to share the talent and story of artists like him with the world.</p>

<h3><strong>What is sidewalk art?</strong></h3>
<p>Sidewalk art has a story. It's that amazing piece that can only be found off the beaten path. Each piece is truly unique and reflects not only the artist but also the culture. Our goal is to bring you the piece along with their story. The art featured will be paintings, photography, jewelry, and pottery.</p>
<h3><strong>The <em>Klawedis</em> Website.</strong></h3>
<p>The Klawedis Website will serve to showcase art and artists from around the world while providing a marketplace for you to buy affordable art. Video diaries documenting the personal Journey of the artists will accompany the pieces and provide more depth to the background of the art and artist you choose to support. As the Klawedis Project grows the website will also support submissions from world travelers like yourself that find an artist in need of greater exposure.</p>
<h3><strong>Where does the money go?</strong></h3>
<p>The funds we raise will go towards the procurement of art from around the world and building a website capable of displaying these pieces.  In the first phase all of the art will be purchased on location and resold via the website. As we build relationships and find Art Ambassadors the cost of acquisition will be reduced.</p>

After ‘retiring’ from rowing Deaglan joined the technology sector. With a passion for global initiatives we created <em>Klawedis</em> to affect positive change in both art and communities. </p>

a social sculpture at stattbad wedding
host / 3ECK, STATTBAD 



project dates
start / July 8th, 2014
opening / August 2nd, 2014
closing / September 6th, 2014 (approximately)

Most crowdfunding campaigns help finance products and provide their donors with certain rewards.
Instead of providing a product, our campaign offers donors the opportunity to be part of a social interaction. Together we would like to live up to and communicate our ideas so that we can achieve and experience a playfull interconnection. 
Beyond the collective work we have created, this is a truly collaborative project and can not exist with out your help. Therefore we are calling for people's support so that we can realize this project independently.
All donors, regardless of how much each individual decides to contribute, will have their name engraved in the surface of The Wave.
 




Für die deutsche Version, bitte folgt dem Link zu unserem Blog:
diewelleimwedding.com

As
a dynamic object, The
Wave
follows Joseph Beuys’ example of working and performing, creating a
life-synthesing piece of art that results in a social sculpture, a
completed tangible form that is likely to emerge whenever people feel
and perceive without judgement. It’s an interactive evolution that
does not follow a given scale and can be altered at any second.The
initial idea behind the wave-shaped ramp is clear. It
symbolizes
a recollection of the skateboard
movement's roots: some of the first skateboarders were surfers,
surfers who were looking for the perfect
wave - even outside the water. As an experienceable object the wave
is first of all an oversized skateboard-ramp in the shape of a wave
that reminds the spectator of a megaramp. Thanks to its conceptual
design, however, it can at the same time be used at a much smaller scale.
The
Wave has a wide range of possible uses because of its design and
size. 

Besides
its function as a skate ramp, it is intended to become a platform for
a variety of cultural events, such as theatrical performances, movie
screenings, classical and modern concerts, exhibitions, readings, and
so on.


The
intention behind the project is to create a forum for cultural
exchange in which anyone can take part. It is a comprehensive piece
of art that grows and thrives because of the ongoing events and
happenings that take place on the basis of its existence. It is an
egalitarian object that invites its own co-creation. Thus the
interactive process already begins with a three-week construction
period and culminates in the following six-week exhibition phase.

measurements









At a width of 33 feet and a length of 75 feet, the wooden stream poors down into the deep end of the former men's swimming pool, where it hits the blue-tiled wall, slowly rises up, and finally breaks at the breathtaking height of 20 feet. The dynamic power of moving water, icebound within a wooden sculpture. A snapshot. Accessible. Palpable. Playable and tangible. A playground for a whole city.
 
what the money is being used for
15.000 €      / construction wood

  3.000 €      / metal
  2.500 €      / logistics

and I am a student at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I am double majoring
in Studio Art and Education, with a concentration in Printmaking, and a minor
in Art History. I’m originally from a small town in Iowa, and while I wasn’t
afforded many opportunities growing up, I've always had big ambitions. My dream is to
create and study art all over the world, and by helping me fund my study abroad
I’ll be able to dip my toes in the water, so to speak. </p>
<p>In May I will be
travelling to London for two weeks with about 80 other students from my
University. This group will be a mix of criminal justice and art history
majors, traveling for different aspects of the culture. During this trip we
will visit every major museum; cathedral, historical site… basically everything
we can with art historical significance. I have never traveled outside of the
United States, and this trip is truly a dream come true. </p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p><p>Overall, I’ll need about
$5,000 to cover the costs of my airfare, lodging, food, as well as spending
money and my bills/pet care back home while I’m away, so every little bit helps.
If you help me fund this dream trip, not only will you receive my eternal
gratitude, but I’ll also be providing a few gifts to show my thanks. These
range anywhere from a postcard sent to you during my trip abroad, to a
souvenir, to some handmade items that you’ll get before I even step on the
plane! Unfortunately I can’t afford anything huge, but I promise the perks you
do receive will be full of love and gratitude! If I don’t make my full goal,
that’s ok! I can use every penny, and will still be able to go on my trip. The
study abroad is charged to my tuition account, and is paid for with my student
loans. However, I am accustomed to using that money for bills like rent,
electricity, and groceries as I am a full time student. As you can see, this
means I still need to raise these funds so that I still have a home to come
back to!</p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p>This trip is important
for a young artist like myself because I, and most of the artistic community,
believe that one must have a solid base knowledge in art’s history as well as a
wide world view in order to create the best work one possibly can. And we all
know that art significantly impacts our communities, as well as the world. </p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>
</p><p>I also understand that
while some may want to help me fund this adventure, the money just isn’t there.
And believe me, asking for money can be really awkward. If you’d still like to
help me out, please feel free to share this link and get the word out. Like I

Since 2006, over 20 ensemble-based performance companies have formed in New Orleans and stand amongst the established artists that returned post-Katrina. With few traditional theatre houses, very little funding support, no centralized ticketing system, and absent rehearsal spaces, New Orleans performing artists have mounted over 1,000 performances in the past five years. More than half of these performances exhibited original work utilizing ensemble practices, behaviors, and conceptual strategies.</p><p>The DISTILLERY exists to support New Orleans artists by providing them with the resources that they need to focus on their creative development. </p><br/><br/><p><b>Here’s How:</b></p><p>The DISTILLERY imagines what <b>4 New Orleans mid-career artists</b> could achieve if provided <b>local mentorship, national mentorship, rehearsal space, free public showings</b> and a <b>development stipend</b> in a comprehensive <b>3 month fellowship program</b> at the <b>Contemporary Arts Center, New Orleans (CAC).</b></p><p>The DISTILLERY fellowship captures dynamic processes utilized in the rehearsal room when engaging new creative disciplines. </p><p>The DISTILLERY fosters an audience-driven critical dialogue that promotes a sustainable approach to making performance work in a constantly varying environment.</p><br/><br/><p><b>Why Contribute:</b></p><p>The DISTILLERY is currently a <b>pilot program</b> that needs <b>$10,000</b> to fund our inaugural year. This much-needed funding will go toward mentors, workshops, showcases, documentation, website, and administrative expenses. This funding also serves as a HUGE show of support for a program that we hope to continue next year, the year after, and the year after that…</p><p>Your support will ensure that The DISTILLERY will be a sustainable program and that it will have the administrative support that it deserves. </p><p>If you can't donate, it is just as important to send this link on to friends and people who love and support arts in New Orleans.</p><p>Thank you!</p><br/><br/><p><b>Current Support:</b></p><p>This fellowship will be housed at the Contemporary Arts Center in the summer of 2014. As our partner, the CAC has been generous in the development of The DISTILLERY program as a tool to elevate the opportunities available to local performing artists. The CAC has provided its gorgeous Freeport/McMoRan black box theater as a rehearsal space and venue for public showings, and has offered to finance the fellows' living and material stipends. The CAC is one of New Orleans's largest connections to national and international performing arts and will offer their wisdom and experience in advising program planning and in sourcing mentors and resources. </p><p>The DISTILLERY team also received a kick-off grant from the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation to begin our process and get the ball rolling. The Jazz and Heritage Foundation and the Arts Council of New Orleans have offered continuous administrative support with heavy focus on community connections and local resources. </p><b><br/><br/></b><p><b>The DISTILLERY 4 Critical Components:</b></p><p>1) MENTORSHIP</p><p>Two established New Orleans creative artists will act in The DISTILLERY fellow selection process, fellow development discussions, and fellow public showings.

You will receive necessary records after the campaign has concluded.*The DISTILLERY A Multi-Disciplinary Artist Residency Housed at the New Orleans Contemporary Arts CenterJune, 2014Why The DISTILLERY?A performing artist continuously redefines how they make work based on the concrete resources of a given environment. Since 2006, over 20 ensemble-based performance companies have formed in New Orleans and stand amongst the established artists that returned post-Katrina. With few traditional theatre houses, very little funding support, no centralized ticketing system, and absent rehearsal spaces, New Orleans performing artists have mounted over 1,000 performances in the past five years. More than half of these performances exhibited original work utilizing ensemble practices, behaviors, and conceptual strategies.The DISTILLERY exists to support New Orleans artists by providing them with the resources that they need to focus on their creative development. Here’s How:The DISTILLERY imagines what 4 New Orleans mid-career artists could achieve if provided local mentorship, national mentorship, rehearsal space, free public showings and a development stipend in a comprehensive 3 month fellowship program at the Contemporary Arts Center, New Orleans (CAC).The DISTILLERY fellowship captures dynamic processes utilized in the rehearsal room when engaging new creative disciplines. The DISTILLERY fosters an audience-driven critical dialogue that promotes a sustainable approach to making performance work in a constantly varying environment.Why Contribute:The DISTILLERY is currently a pilot program that needs $10,000 to fund our inaugural year. This much-needed funding will go toward mentors, workshops, showcases, documentation, website, and administrative expenses. This funding also serves as a HUGE show of support for a program that we hope to continue next year, the year after, and the year after that…Your support will ensure that The DISTILLERY will be a sustainable program and that it will have the administrative support that it deserves. If you can't donate, it is just as important to send this link on to friends and people who love and support arts in New Orleans.Thank you!Current Support:This fellowship will be housed at the Contemporary Arts Center in the summer of 2014. As our partner, the CAC has been generous in the development of The DISTILLERY program as a tool to elevate the opportunities available to local performing artists. The CAC has provided its gorgeous Freeport/McMoRan black box theater as a rehearsal space and venue for public showings, and has offered to finance the fellows' living and material stipends. The CAC is one of New Orleans's largest connections to national and international performing arts and will offer their wisdom and experience in advising program planning and in sourcing mentors and resources. The DISTILLERY team also received a kick-off grant from the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation to begin our process and get the ball rolling. The Jazz and Heritage Foundation and the Arts Council of New Orleans have offered continuous administrative support with heavy focus on community connections and local resources. The DISTILLERY 4 Critical Components:1) MENTORSHIPTwo established New Orleans creative artists will act in The DISTILLERY fellow selection process, fellow development discussions, and fellow public showings. Whether the local established artist shares the same medium as the fellow (puppetry and puppetry) or has seemingly very little in common with the fellow’s medium (puppetry and modern dance), the established artist will provide critical feedback, creative discussion and local resources for each of The DISTILLERY fellows. These two local artists are critical to the development of The DISTILLERY throughout its pilot program and are engaged before the selection process begins and after the fellows conclude the program.Two established national artists will join The DISTILLERY fellows for one weekend each. During this weekend, there will be a roundtable discussion with our program Creative Consultant Craig Peterson and a free public showing to New Orleans audiences. Following this showing, there will be a roundtable discussion or creative training led by Craig and the visiting artist for the 4 participating fellows.

notre cuisine ?

<p>D’une simple question, j’ai vite découvert les méandres de
la conception de cuisine aménagée. </p>
<p>Il existe tant de choix, de qualité et de prix, qu’on ne
sait jamais si notre achat est le meilleur.</p>
<p>De ce constat, j’ai parcouru le monde de la conception de
cuisine durant des années, de livreur de meubles de cuisine, à la pose de
cuisines, en passant par des postes de vendeurs en magasin de grandes enseignes
à la direction d’un magasin. J’ai découvert aussi les différences de politique
commerciale entre les différentes marques avec les fameuses remises
commerciales qui ne veulent plus rien dire car elles sont <b><i>systématiques voir
malhonnêtes</i></b>. </p>
<p>Parce que je crois sincèrement que cette époque est
dépassée, et qu’aujourd’hui nous sommes dans une époque de grande transparence
avec la clientèle, j’ai décidé de créer un concept où le client aura toujours
la certitude d’obtenir le meilleur prix et cela dès la première présentation de
tarif. </p>
<p><b>Toujours le prix le plus
bas et en direct, c’est ainsi que j’ai décidé de mettre en place pour la
première fois dans ce métier le ‘’meilleur prix garanti ou remboursement de la
différence’’.</b></p>
<p>J’ai aussi compris qu’avant d’arriver chez les clients, les
cuisines passaient par plusieurs intermédiaires. Des plateformes d’assemblage,
des intermédiaires de stockage, des agents distributeurs, des enseignes, et
tout cela peut représenter jusqu’à 15 % du prix de la cuisine. Après cela, il

<p><b>Mon objectif
unique : proposer des cuisines sur mesure et uniquement de qualité, à des
prix abordables, conçu en fonction des besoins et des habitudes du client</b>.</p>
<p>Pour arriver à cet objectif, plusieurs challenges à gagner.
Premièrement, trouver un fabricant proposant des produits de très grande
qualité qui accepte de produire nos cuisines. Après plusieurs portes fermées ou
produits de mauvaises qualités, après avoir refusé tous les fabricants de cuisine
en kit synonyme de mauvaise résistance dans le temps, une usine allemande
accepte de produire nos cuisines. Ce sera la plus grosse usine européenne de
fabrication de cuisine connue sous le nom de NOBILIA. Et pour varier le choix,
le plus gros fabricant Italien de cuisine, spécialisé dans les portes sans
poignées et dans les laques, ce sera ARMONY CUCINE.</p>
<p>Reste un point, aussi important que la qualité et que le
prix, c’est le service. Pour permettre de bien comprendre les besoins des
clients, rien de mieux que de voir  le
projet sur place. C’est pourquoi tous nos concepteurs qui conseilleront les
clients dans leur choix, feront leur rendez-vous directement chez les clients,
pour bien comprendre leurs habitudes et aussi pour bien découvrir les
contraintes liées à l’habitation.</p>
<p>C’est ainsi que le concept de vente de cuisine à domicile
s’est construit.</p>
<p><b>Et maintenant qu’on a
un concept … que fait-on ?</b></p>
<p>La grande interrogation, comment trouver des clients sans
même avoir un magasin ! Et bien il existe aujourd’hui de nombreux canaux
de communication, de réseaux de rencontre et de mise en avant de concept, mais
surtout les réseaux sociaux et relationnels. Et c’est là que je vais avoir
besoin de l’aide du plus grand nombre d’entre vous. </p>
<p>Premièrement, pour faire parler de ce concept il faut un
support pour montrer ce que l’on sait faire. Le site internet est aujourd’hui
un moyen de faire parler de nous facilement et à petit prix. Mais il faut que

conceptions de cuisines sur mesure et de très grande qualité avec des exemples
de prix pour prouver que nous avons des

<p>Dans le financement d’une entreprise standard, les

20  cuisines par mois sur les départements

notre cuisine ?

D’une simple question, j’ai vite découvert les méandres de
la conception de cuisine aménagée. 
Il existe tant de choix, de qualité et de prix, qu’on ne
sait jamais si notre achat est le meilleur.
De ce constat, j’ai parcouru le monde de la conception de
cuisine durant des années, de livreur de meubles de cuisine, à la pose de
cuisines, en passant par des postes de vendeurs en magasin de grandes enseignes
à la direction d’un magasin. J’ai découvert aussi les différences de politique
commerciale entre les différentes marques avec les fameuses remises
commerciales qui ne veulent plus rien dire car elles sont systématiques voir
malhonnêtes. 
Parce que je crois sincèrement que cette époque est
dépassée, et qu’aujourd’hui nous sommes dans une époque de grande transparence
avec la clientèle, j’ai décidé de créer un concept où le client aura toujours
la certitude d’obtenir le meilleur prix et cela dès la première présentation de
tarif. 
Toujours le prix le plus
bas et en direct, c’est ainsi que j’ai décidé de mettre en place pour la
première fois dans ce métier le ‘’meilleur prix garanti ou remboursement de la
différence’’.
J’ai aussi compris qu’avant d’arriver chez les clients, les
cuisines passaient par plusieurs intermédiaires. Des plateformes d’assemblage,
des intermédiaires de stockage, des agents distributeurs, des enseignes, et
tout cela peut représenter jusqu’à 15 % du prix de la cuisine. Après cela, il
existe des charges structurelles comme la location du magasin et le coût des expositions
qui représentent 20 % du prix de vente de la cuisine.
En éliminant ces deux grandes dépenses, nous arrivons à des
offres bien inférieures à celles du marché et cela permets de proposer des
produits de qualité très abordable. L’idée de la vente à domicile se profile
doucement.
Mon objectif
unique : proposer des cuisines sur mesure et uniquement de qualité, à des
prix abordables, conçu en fonction des besoins et des habitudes du client.
Pour arriver à cet objectif, plusieurs challenges à gagner.

clients dans leur choix, feront leur rendez-vous directement chez les clients,
pour bien comprendre leurs habitudes et aussi pour bien découvrir les
contraintes liées à l’habitation.
C’est ainsi que le concept de vente de cuisine à domicile
s’est construit.

un concept … que fait-on ?
La grande interrogation, comment trouver des clients sans

I created this book to further share their voice from a visual voice I painted to allow more individuals to hear/view the ocean voice and make well informed choices in their lives. These choices can create a better life for the animals, their community, and the earth.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am an advocate for improving the educational system to allow us as individuals to evolve with the changes that are occurring around the world. Today is the time for ""PROTECTION"" of what is still alive on this planet.</div>
<div>""EDUCATE to ACTIVATE"" is the objective so why not donate books to the school system and public libraries. If they are on the shelves then they can be shared immensely!<br/><br/>There are at least 60 art photos shared in the book including the individual paintings that have a strong story to expose in each chapter. The chapters speak about an animal and their background, then how this story was painted as a visual voice, finishing with the positive impacts that have happened the past 6 years that have impacted this species life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This book not only educates with awareness of what is happening in the ocean and its inhabitants it also INSPIRES people that change does occur with perserverance when you can look back over a set amount of time.</div>

<p>Capoeira. The first martial art actually developed in the America’s.  Capoeira is described as a Brazilian martial art that was developed around the 16th century by African slaves in Brazil to effect their liberation from slavery.  Developed in secret, it was disguised as a dance so the slaves could openly practice it in front of their masters on their Sunday day of rest. </p>
<p>Capoeira, in spite of its challenging looks, is suitable for men, women, and children of all ages.  It is common for people with physical disabilities to excel at Capoeira because its form is tailored to the abilities of each person, allowing it to benefit a greater audience than more commonly known Asian based martial arts.</p>
<p>Capoeira incorporates more than just “martial arts”.  It is truly a cultural experience, combining music, dance, acrobatics, and martial arts skills to promote health, knowledge, and self-confidence in people of all different walks of life and physical abilities.</p>
<p>While Capoeira is an American martial art, it is still new and relatively unknown here in the United States. We at West Michigan Capoeira seek to promote the appreciation, awareness, and benefits of Capoeira to our Region and beyond, to demonstrate to others that their lives are not bound by their perceived limitations.</p>
<p>Centuries ago, Capoeira helped to liberate its founders from slavery. Today, West Michigan Capoeira students can experience that Capo continues to liberate; unshackling us to achieve far beyond our expectations, not only in our martial art, but in every facet of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Who is West Michigan Capoeira?</strong></p>
<p>West Michigan Capoeira, was founded in 2007 by Capoeira instructor Show Grande, and is based in Kalamazoo and Lansing, Michigan. We are an independent, unfunded organization that trains primarily at Western Michigan University, Michigan State University, or on the street, as traditional Capoeiristas.</p>
<p>We are a relatively small group, and as an independent organization have to fund all of our activities from our own limited means.</p>
<p><strong>Our 2013 Batizado Project:</strong></p>
<p>We are making plans for our 3rd annual Batizado which will take place on September 6 - 8, which is a festival that initiates all new Capoeira students into the international Capoeira community.  Batizado simply means “Baptism” in Portuguese, and is when Capoeirista’s from all over come together to celebrate the initiation of the new students and more advanced students are promoted to higher ranks.</p>
<p>It is a centuries-old tradition to invite some of the few Capoeira Masters from all over the world to come to regional Batizado’s to evaluate, instruct, and inspire all students and their instructors to excel, and to honor both the students and the Masters by presenting them with their new ranks.</p>
<p>We hope that in 2013 we can host one of the largest Batizado’s in Michigan, inviting other Capoeira groups to participate, as well as invite several Capoeira Masters from Brazil, Israel, and all around the United States to participate in this celebration.  The event will be free to the public to allow maximum outreach by our organization to educate people about the art of Capoeira, the only actual martial art founded in America.</p>

<h2>These painted images touch on just about all of the full range of human (and Plafundian) emotions and activities – and manage to be funny, heartfelt, and erotic too!</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why am I asking for money?</span></strong> </h3>
<p>I’ve come up with this new way of telling a very cool story through words and pictures. I also think<em> <strong>Dreams of Patoot</strong></em> is some kind of category-breaker. Much progress has already been made in the areas of software development and interactive design, but these services do not come cheaply. </p>
<p><em><img alt=""Patoot iPad"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/fmj7s0.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""iPad Patoot""/></em></p>
<h3>I need your financial contribution to complete this project. <strong>Will you help?</strong>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Some background</span></strong></h3>
<p>As an editorial illustrator, I produced images for some of North America’s finest magazines. My originals have been exhibited in Japan, Italy and France, as well as the United States and Canada. Currently my professional interests lie in the areas of painting, and the writing and illustration of books.</p>
<p>My visual work is represented on my <a href=""http://www.blairdrawson.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""website"">website</a>. You can also friend me on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/blair.drawson"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Facebook"">Facebook</a> and follow Patoot on Twitter.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who is Patoot?</span></strong></h3>
<p>Patoot is a young citizen of Plafunda. Like young citizens everywhere, he has friends and relations, and they all have their own distinct storyline separate from, and parallel to, the main narrative. That’s the interactive part of the app.<em> </em></p>
<p><em><img alt=""Patoot Images"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/2iw7pqt.gif"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Patoot Images""/></em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What is Plafunda?</span></strong></h3>
<p>It is a distant benevolent planet, similar to our own in many ways, yet significantly different in others. The text for <em><strong>Dreams of Patoot</strong></em> is in a form of Plafundatongue, channeled by me through email messages from the Plafundans themselves. They have asked that Patoot’s adventurous story be shared with all of Terra. </p>

<p> </p></div>","My project, Dreams of Patoot, features more than 400 of my illustrations in an Interactive Visual Narrative specifically made for the iPhone and iPad.
These painted images touch on just about all of the full range of human (and Plafundian) emotions and activities – and manage to be funny, heartfelt, and erotic too!
 

Why am I asking for money? 
I’ve come up with this new way of telling a very cool story through words and pictures. I also think Dreams of Patoot is some kind of category-breaker. Much progress has already been made in the areas of software development and interactive design, but these services do not come cheaply. 

I need your financial contribution to complete this project. Will you help?

 
Some background
As an editorial illustrator, I produced images for some of North America’s finest magazines. My originals have been exhibited in Japan, Italy and France, as well as the United States and Canada. Currently my professional interests lie in the areas of painting, and the writing and illustration of books.
My visual work is represented on my website. You can also friend me on Facebook and follow Patoot on Twitter.
 
Who is Patoot?
Patoot is a young citizen of Plafunda. Like young citizens everywhere, he has friends and relations, and they all have their own distinct storyline separate from, and parallel to, the main narrative. That’s the interactive part of the app. 

 
What is Plafunda?
It is a distant benevolent planet, similar to our own in many ways, yet significantly different in others. The text for Dreams of Patoot is in a form of Plafundatongue, channeled by me through email messages from the Plafundans themselves. They have asked that Patoot’s adventurous story be shared with all of Terra. 
 

You can help enable that mission!  By contributing you will help me pay publishing, software development, and interactive design service costs.

and writer on art, and I live in New York. The idea of the Artists At 
Work (AAW) project is to create a major photo-documentary record of 
contemporary 
art-making; the work processes, practices, work spaces, and portraits 
of over 150 leading, established and emerging visual artists based in 
the US.  The major goal is to publish a book and create an online archive. <br/><br/> Part curatorial project, part photo essay, part documentary
archive, AAW is also related to and a continuation of an online video 
project that I produced from 2006-2012, <a href=""http://newarttv.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">newarttv.com</a>, comprising about 200 videos and films on contemporary artists.  Some fifty AAW shoots have been 
completed to date, and there are another 120-150 shoots  projected through 
2015-16, mainly in the New York and Los Angeles areas, and elsewhere as 
circumstances allow.  The gallery images  are a selection
 from shoots of the last year.<br/><br/>
<p>I think of AAW as following in the footsteps of Hans 
Namuth, Rudy Burckhardt, and other photographers who left an important 
documentary record of many of the leading artists of the 20th 
century. The interest, support,  participation that artists have 
given AAW has been amazing.  Funds are needed to advance and 
complete production,
 publish a book, and build an AAW web site and online archive. The 
contributor rewards  include 
editioned prints of  photos from the current AAW series and a projected 
AAW book. And every contributor from $10 on up gets the monthly AAW 
e-newsletter, with project news and images of current shoots, which 
should be fun. So consider 
supporting the Artists At Work project with a contribution.

<h3>How MIDDAY Began</h3>
<p>MIDDAY founder/curator Marissa Molinar was a late-comer to contemporary dance, starting her professional training in 2009. She left her role as Membership Coordinator at Boston Dance Alliance in 2015 ready to dive into her training by taking 15 dance classes a week, but she was saddened to see many established teachers in Boston retiring while new teachers' classes folded almost immediately due to high cost of space and underdeveloped teaching skills. Marissa created Midday Movement Series in response to this: MIDDAY was designed as a space for emerging contemporary dance teachers to find their voice and hone their teaching practice while offering affordable, innovative classes to advanced and professional dancers. MIDDAY currently offers classes Tuesday to Thursday from 12-2 PM at <a href=""http://ballettheatre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">José Mateo Ballet Theatre</a>.</p>
<p>For the last 3.5 years, MIDDAY has hosted weekly classes with three inaugural teachers, but we are ready to take it to the next level!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How MIDDAY Is Growing</h3>
<p>We've grown a lot already in 2019. Since <u>December 2018</u>, we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>established a new 6-person <a href=""http://www.middaymovement.org/schedule.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Midday Shuffle Cohort</a>; </li>
<li>established new <a href=""http://www.middaymovement.org/schedule.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Short Series offerings</a> to include somatic methods; </li>
<li>welcomed a new ongoing teacher, <a href=""https://www.mystiqueillusionsdancetheatre.org/director"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ronnie Thomas</a>, to hone his teaching practice while working with Marissa one-on-one to obtain organizational and administrative skills; and</li>
<li> begun creating an internship program to support new arts administrative activists</li>
</ul>
<p>But there's so much more we are still working on! This year, in response to feedback from artists in our community, we'll be creating an informal showing series; hosting workshops and master classes with guest artists; creating resources of support to emerging choreographers and company directors; hosting social gatherings and dance parties, and more.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Weekly dance classes are the core of what we do at MIDDAY - not only to work our artistic brains and bodies, but also because weekly in-person engagement is vital to nurturing the strong social bonds we are building in our community. Our $6000 goal is our annual cost of space rental for our classes. Your donation will not only let these classes continue, but will also allow MIDDAY to flourish even further!</p>
<p>As a <strong>Thank You</strong>, our perks include class cards and show tickets from MIDDAY teacher-choreographers to directly invite you to join our community. You are also welcome to gift any part of your ""perk package"" to a friend to keep the community growing!   </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What began merely as a class series is transforming into an initiative for broad impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>MIDDAY has drawn hundreds of class-takers through its doors over the years, which not only raises visibility for professional-level dance in Boston but also gives our dance professionals a platform to connect directly to a wider public, helping them to find and train dancers, meet new collaborators, and grow their audiences for performances as well as for their classes;<br/> </li>
<li>MIDDAY teachers consult extensively with Marissa in areas including administration, development, marketing, social justice, and social capital to gain skills as holistic arts entrepreneurs;<br/> </li>
<li>MIDDAY is growing a name for dance in Boston by inviting and hosting emerging teachers from other dance cities, including New York, Philadelphia, and Brussels, Belgium.<br/> </li>
<li>MIDDAY is connecting Boston-area dance artists to create a growing, lasting network of professionals, increasing the viability of this art form in our city.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>You Can Help</h3>
<p>While donations at any level help immensely, MIDDAY also firmly believes in the power of people coming together, and <u>we cannot do this without you</u>!

<p>• Funding the printing of the book is the biggest challenge to the project. A reliable printer has been chosen but I need to fill it with as many equine paintings as I can.  More paintings = more pages so I'm challenging myself to spend the next 9 months of my life painting, painting, painting.</p>
<p>• I have already devoted my art career to raising money for rescue, so I'm confident in seeing the project through to completion.  I have expenses and fees for using this platform but my plan is to give as much money back to the horse rescues as I can.</p>
<p>• I'm working closely with a few key rescues I've developed a relationship with, but the more exposure this art project recieves, the more horses that are ultimately helped with this venture.  I'm not a fundraiser, just an Artist wanting to help horses so please be patient, I will post any and all updates as quickly as I can.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
</div>
</div></div>","On behalf of abused and neglected horses everywhere, thank you for taking a peek at my campaign.  I've been passionate about animal rescue since I was a young girl so as a Fine Artist I've been involved with many rescue organizations and have chosen to give a portion of my proceeds to help raise money for their care.  
My goal with this hardcover book is to create a visually appealing look at the beauty that still resides in the unwanted.  So many horses wind up at auction and are saved just in the nick of time by the many caring volunteers that have dedicated their lives to saving these poor innocent creatures.  
 

FAQs

When will the book come out?

I plan on having the book published in late October 2013 so they will be available for the upcoming 2014 Year of the Horse.
 

What's in the book?

Paintings of the various rescued horses and their stories that are from my contributors as well as showcasing horses from many of the rescue organizations this book will be supporting.  The more submissions/contributions I receive, the larger the book will be!
 

Who selects the art in the book?


I will be curating the book. But I won't be doing it alone. I will be reaching out to equine rescues and more importantly, YOU. All campaign contributors will be welcomed to join in on discussions pertaining to the contents of the book.


What does my money go towards?

The funds raised will go towards:

The very high costs of producing hardcover books
Additional perks ex: Year of the Horse Calendar
Art Supplies
The Rescue Organization of your choice

 

But I don't own a horse! What's in it for me?

You can choose any level of perk you want and we'll work out a solution involving an original painting of your choice or even an archival fine art print of an existing piece of artwork.  I also have functional items like ipad and iphone cases, there's something for everyone. 
 

I have no money! How can I help?

Spread the word! Let everyone know about your love of horses and my campaign to help them! Mention it on Twitter or Facebook or any other social media site to help get the word out.
 

Will the books be available anywhere else?

They will be available in my Etsy Shop and on my Website and available for auction by various rescue organizations.
 

How much will shipping cost?

Shipping will be estimated to cost:
Canada                     $10-15
USA                          $10-20
Everywhere Else      $20-30
Expedited shipping will be available to all contributors and you will be informed of all your shipping options via email at the book's completion.

Yes.

(<i>Roooobot Affliction</i> - ATHF).  <span style=""font: 14.0px Lucida Grande;""><br/><br/></span>Secondly, and this is just my personal belief, Robots are the next evolutionary step of mankind. I say this (because I'm a huge geek) because this planet is a finite residence for humanity, meaning eventually billions of years from now the Sun will burn out...SCIENCE...look it up. This is my opinion here, the logical evolutionary step for continued existence is to be unshackled from the needs of a planet, any planet. To be able to exist in a vacuum and only require a single source of energy (not a combination of various gasses and chemical processes like breathing and eating). Robots already possess this ability and there are other geeks in lab coats trying desperately to give this things Artificial Intelligence...I'm pretty sure they'll figure it out sooner than later.*</p>

Now, I'm not equating artificial life with human life by saying that robots will be the future models of humanity.  It is just my belief that they are the same and rather than ""painting"" (see how I did that?) a bleak picture on  human beings as becoming extinct, I'm optimistic that no matter what shape humanity will become whatever form we happen to be Millions of years from now....</p>

As an avid video game enthusiast I play a lot of Halo 4 (Yeah guys I'm the Jerk driving the Warthog, lol ) , so I ""get"" the human need for escapism. When doing research for this series (<a href=""http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=lurking"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: #1597bb;"">lurking</span></a> on LARPING forums, watching some <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/LARP-Alliance-New-York-City/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: #1597bb;"">local campaigns in action</span></a>) I have come to deeply respect and admire LARPers. The level of creativity, dedication and passion I have seen in this community has been a great source inspiration for me, not only for this series but for future projects. <span style=""font: 14.0px Lucida Grande;""><br/><br/></span>This level of zealotry (generally found in those who engage in this kind of behavior, especially someone who custom fabricates every piece of their level 37 Paladin armor - Mike!) has my utmost admiration and respect. Escapism grants the ability to actively transcend into a reality that removes you from the boring. I NEED that from time to time (standing on line at the DMV playing Inotia4 on my smartphone) and if your still reading this I suppose you do too.</p>

You'd better be able to back your talk up with skill or you are not worth the time.  I like that. It is that kind of vibe that gives me the pit of your stomach feel that I often find when I challenge and surprise myself...I live for that. It is in the air in Newark...that ""raw and powerful"" jazz I am talking about in the video is not inflated Art-speak. I have been to a number of cities and not once has anything moved me to get off my ass and commit to a passion - I see that here, at every show, with most everyone here.

Well, over the past few years I have had this desire to do a Gallery show and rather than campaign for funds to sit in an studio and paint by myself...I want to show what happens INSIDE the studio. It was only until this year that the desire manifested itself into a serious compulsion...and only a crazy person would attempt it...a crazy person or someone who is haunted by Dr. Gordbort's Robot Factory. Did I do that apostrophe right? Damn apostrophes.
The Project:
""To intimately document the completion of a Gallery show from the early stage planning , painting and setup to the actual show itself.  When complete, the film should give you a front row seat into what it takes to take a dream, lots of gumption, and right platform to bring it to reality. Really, this is my ode to Newark, the place that rekindled my passion for painting.  I want to bring these things to life here where it started and to bring my brand of fun into a city that would benefit most from a little levity.""
Components:
Finish the large 8-10  acrylic on canvas series portraits45"" x 31.5""114.3 cm x 80.1 cmpieces in various stages of completion as well as 8 smaller study pieces 25"" x 25"" 63.5cm  x 63.5cmto be entered into show.
Here is a mock up of framed pieces.(frames subject to change on indv. basis but overall the look is what is pictured here):Main SeriesThis requires:  1-2 Months of studio space, painting materials/ framing (think chunky old timey museum frames), A/V equip, Videographer, Fabricator (for frames) Gallery space, Show budget, management and advertising.
TIMELINEGilosan Indiegogo Timeline
Chronicle entire process of paintings through a video documentary. This will be an intimate look at how these painting are made. I will be talking in front of an small group 3-4 people (guest appearances will be scheduled in advance and if you are in applicable the rewards bracket, we will give you a heads up to who will be at taping).
This will serve as a POC (Proof of Concept) for future DVD and possible live shows highlighting different artists from Newark.

The DVD
Stage :
studio set up
The elements for the video are subject to change but will include these 4 core elements.
1 - What series of events led to this show and how you got to this point.  This is where I will be talking on camera about the many decisions that eventually led to this event, including some of the setbacks and hardships along the way.  Topics which I will be discussing include but are not limited to: spending 6 mos. hanging around and performing the open mic scene in NYC, driving taxi cab in Tenafly, NJ to help fund this show (I have stories), my experiences in the illustration, design and digital asset management worlds.  (I delve into my experiences on the road to getting here, some good, some bad...most definitely not for minors.)
2 - How I paintI paint at a fast pace on multiple easels at a time. I will be explaining  my process on how I tackle specific academic things like lighting, shadow, blending and composition.
3 - Guest Local ArtistsDiscuss themes ideas and techniques (shop talk). Currently scheduling interviews for local guest Newark artists (5 slots) slots and (3 slots) non local.
4 - Whats NextShowcasing and preparing the groundwork for the next subject series. Currently : Dr. Gordbort's old timey robot boxing - my take on the fantastic promotional series of barefisted boxing from the turn of the century and 70's bollywood posters as my homage to my childhood influences.
** If this model proves to be successful, my plan is to eventually fold similar minded artists into a show tour.
You talk a lot about Robots.  What's this theme you're on about?First off,I like painting robots. (Roooobot Affliction - ATHF).  Secondly, and this is just my personal belief, Robots are the next evolutionary step of mankind. I say this (because I'm a huge geek) because this planet is a finite residence for humanity, meaning eventually billions of years from now the Sun will burn out...SCIENCE...look it up. This is my opinion here, the logical evolutionary step for continued existence is to be unshackled from the needs of a planet, any planet. To be able to exist in a vacuum and only require a single source of energy (not a combination of various gasses and chemical processes like breathing and eating). Robots already possess this ability and there are other geeks in lab coats trying desperately to give this things Artificial Intelligence...I'm pretty sure they'll figure it out sooner than later.*
Then what? We will be the outdated models of humanity? Now, I'm not equating artificial life with human life by saying that robots will be the future models of humanity.  It is just my belief that they are the same and rather than ""painting"" (see how I did that?) a bleak picture on  human beings as becoming extinct, I'm optimistic that no matter what shape humanity will become whatever form we happen to be Millions of years from now....
There will still be those who, in order to dispel the occasional ""mundacity"" of existence, will put on some goblin armor and LARP.
I wanted to compose these images; the robots look as if you were a casual observer at a Larping event taking candid pictures. 
It is this idea of escapism that I am exploring here. As an avid video game enthusiast I play a lot of Halo 4 (Yeah guys I'm the Jerk driving the Warthog, lol ) , so I ""get"" the human need for escapism. When doing research for this series (lurking on LARPING forums, watching some local campaigns in action) I have come to deeply respect and admire LARPers. The level of creativity, dedication and passion I have seen in this community has been a great source inspiration for me, not only for this series but for future projects. This level of zealotry (generally found in those who engage in this kind of behavior, especially someone who custom fabricates every piece of their level 37 Paladin armor - Mike!) has my utmost admiration and respect. Escapism grants the ability to actively transcend into a reality that removes you from the boring. I NEED that from time to time (standing on line at the DMV playing Inotia4 on my smartphone) and if your still reading this I suppose you do too.
*If you see me at the show ask me about Occums Razor and I will tell you why I am convinced it is inevitable :) Ah, enough high brow prattle. It boils down to this...these robots and exist in my head. I want them OUT. Bringing them to life is a fun experience I wish to share and...""I'm not STOP!""
You Love Newark? Really?
I know Newark has a reputation of being rough around the edges and almost torn up at spots ( lol ), but it is this environment that breeds inspiration. Don't believe me? Wait 'til we finish this project...this is just the beginning.
Newark has been my stomping grounds for the last couple of years. I have a lot of close friends and family here. I sleep at my apartment, office or random couches after too much partying,lol ...I LIVE in Newark.
Simply, Newark and more importantly the artists here...has a real put up or shut up mentality that I find different from other places I have been.  That is until I started getting involved in the Art Scene here. You'd better be able to back your talk up with skill or you are not worth the time.  I like that. It is that kind of vibe that gives me the pit of your stomach feel that I often find when I challenge and surprise myself...I live for that. It is in the air in Newark...that ""raw and powerful"" jazz I am talking about in the video is not inflated Art-speak. I have been to a number of cities and not once has anything moved me to get off my ass and commit to a passion - I see that here, at every show, with most everyone here. Its really quite startling at first, now it fuels my lust for painting.
You know sometimes you just get lucky, I feel lucky to have been exposed  to the kind of talent and skill that inspires creation, here in Newark.
It is this attitude that made me realize...I dont wanna do dull stuff anymore I want to push myself past easy and into DAMN! 
With your help I feel I can do just that.
I'm thinking this is a good disclaimer:
I am not insinuating from this project that I am anything other than an illustrator who enjoys painting, this is not intended as a fine arts show or an instructional video on how to.
This is a crazy dream of mine, that has a small chance to become reality...and possibly some colossal beast which consumes my every being(possibly) with your help.
I want to thank you for taking the time to check out my project.
I would like to take this time to thank my friends and family, without whom I couldn't have even gotten this far.
You guys have been patient and supportive throughout all this madness...I am lucky and blessed to have you guys in my life.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div><strong>PURPOSE:</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>What we are trying to is raise at least 6000 dollars (our target, naturally, is more--there is much more we will be able to do on this installation with these craftsmen when our resources expand) in order to create a beautiful and magical storytelling experience on a hillside in Armenia.  The money raised will be spent in Armenia on artisans and other workers to create the site and experience known as Crystals of Refrain.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>INTRO:</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>For the past decade I have been traveling around the world installing bronze plaques and historic sites that honor events from a parallel world I call Kcymaerxthaere.  Kcymaerxthaere is a alternative universe--the project is like a novel with every page in a different place. <em>Where </em>you read such a page influences <em>how </em>you visualize that story. It may sound a bit unusual, but it is so rewarding to see how many people conjuring up another reality without a single digital enhancement--all by themselves in the real world with their mind.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And ultimately I think that is what Indiegogo is for: to connect people with beautiful and unexpected things that can help bring into the world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Currently we are at 90 markers and sites in 20 countries so far.  We're very excited to add the story and installation <em>Crystals of Refrain</em> in the village of Aghtsk, Armenia this spring.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was first invited to Armenia by my friend Al Eisaian and found it was even more magical than I imagined.  In particular, I was lucky enough to spend some time in Aghtsk where Al was working on establishing his yoga retreat.  Looking around there I realized it was the perfect spot for <em>Crystals of Refrain.</em>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are so many things I could say about this project, I almost don't know where to start: the incredible experiences Kcymaerxthaereal followers have by searching for our sites in unfamiliar places or the experiences the local kids have when they realize they are connected through a fantastical story to kids like themselves all over our real world? And of course the rich experiences I am fortunate to have by working with the local community to realize my vision which becomes a part of the story of their place.  We are only at the beginning of the process of telling this story all around the world.  I have a feeling that the site in Armenia will be particularly special but it will also find itself connected to other remarkable places around what we call the earth.  With your support of this particular installation, this enchantment can continue to grow.</div>

<div><strong>THIS STORY / INSTALLATION</strong></div>
<p>With the installation <em>Crystals of Refrain</em> in Aghtsk, Armenia will be home of one of the key stories in Kcymaerxthaere, the story of Eliala Mei-Ning - the woman whose voice was too beautiful to be concealed - and her adventures crossing paths with a boy who is fleeing a flash flood caused by a wave on a beach by his home in what we call Northern Spain.  Eliala's beautiful voice crystalizes the water, allowing the boy to make his way to safety (there is much more to this story and feel free to ask us in comments!).</p>
<p>The landscape and locale in the village of Aghtsk is the perfect setting for this--and not just because it happened there in the parallel world.  We will be installing on a beautiful 4,000 (400 square meter) square foot area not far from the gorge through which the flash flood poured-- and with views over the village to Mount Ararat.  The story will be carved on many different stones and will be revealed to the visitor as they walk through this embedded narrative showcasing mathematics, numbers, mysteries, and explaining how Eliala Mei-Ning and the boy from the sea happened to cross paths so far away from their respective homes.  </p>
<div><strong>ARE YOU REINTERPRETING LOCAL HISTORY?</strong></div>
<div>Not really.  To me, local history is fantastic and Aghtsk has plenty of treasures.  It doesn't need me to make it special, it is special.  But what I do <em>hope</em> is that this project offers something totally different, but also valuable and affecting: the chance to look at the world fresh--not only this landscape in particular but the world in general.  Because that is what Kcymaerxthaere does in <a href=""http://kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/markers/forests_rest"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><strong>place</strong></span></a> after <a href=""http://kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/markers/krblin_jihn_cabin"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><strong>place</strong></span></a>, interestingly the result that all these stories and locations stitch together in the human mind, as result helping people see the <a href=""http://kcymaerxthaere.com/index.php/content/markers/bragansas"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><strong>things</strong></span></a> that aren't there.</div>
<p><strong>WHO CARES WHAT'S NOT THERE?</strong></p>
<div>People ask me that all the time. All I can say is that for most of us, some of the most important things in our lives are the things that were vivid in our minds but did not exist--though they eventually did: a relationship, a business, our families, a career, whatever.  Experiencing a parallel world viscerally engages that part of ourselves--and besides it turns out to be a great way to tell a story.</div>
<p><strong>WHY HELP?</strong></p>
<div>

<div>
<strong><em>Expanding the story </em></strong>--One of the beauties of the Kcymaerxthaere project is that every time we add a new site it makes all the other sites a little bit richer.  By adding Armenia, we enhance a very interesting aspect of the project which is when you imagine the map of our world with the parallel world upon it that mental map in itself becomes an aesthetic object.  And <em>you</em> will have made that happen.</div>

<p><strong>WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?</strong></p>
<div>The money raised is for the creation of the site and the perks made in Armenia.  The exciting part is that we plan to spend all the funds hiring local artisans, stone, stone carvers as well as other vendors in this one of a kind installation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T RAISE ENOUGH?</strong></div>
<div>Excellent question.  We will still make something cool but it will be smaller.  This is why we went for the flex-funding option-our vision for the site is so extensive that even a fragment will tell an important part of the story. We will still have the opportunity to hire local Armenian artisans and craftsmen but on a smaller scale.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU RAISE TOO MUCH</strong></div>
<div>We would love to have that problem and we are ready for it!  We would use it to extend the craft work (more stone for more stories) as well as for other costs of the project in Armenia, such as land and translation expenses.  In edition, we would love to commission other additional works in other media by Armenian craftspeople.  And beyond that it could support the continuation of the story in connected locations.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We welcome any and all conversation and questions related to this vision.</div>

THIS STORY / INSTALLATION
With the installation Crystals of Refrain in Aghtsk, Armenia will be home of one of the key stories in Kcymaerxthaere, the story of Eliala Mei-Ning - the woman whose voice was too beautiful to be concealed - and her adventures crossing paths with a boy who is fleeing a flash flood caused by a wave on a beach by his home in what we call Northern Spain.  Eliala's beautiful voice crystalizes the water, allowing the boy to make his way to safety (there is much more to this story and feel free to ask us in comments!).

ARE YOU REINTERPRETING LOCAL HISTORY?
Not really.  To me, local history is fantastic and Aghtsk has plenty of treasures.  It doesn't need me to make it special, it is special.  But what I do hope is that this project offers something totally different, but also valuable and affecting: the chance to look at the world fresh--not only this landscape in particular but the world in general.  Because that is what Kcymaerxthaere does in place after place, interestingly the result that all these stories and locations stitch together in the human mind, as result helping people see the things that aren't there.
WHO CARES WHAT'S NOT THERE?
People ask me that all the time. All I can say is that for most of us, some of the most important things in our lives are the things that were vivid in our minds but did not exist--though they eventually did: a relationship, a business, our families, a career, whatever.  Experiencing a parallel world viscerally engages that part of ourselves--and besides it turns out to be a great way to tell a story.
WHY HELP?

The perks are cool--Seriously check them out.

Expanding the story --One of the beauties of the Kcymaerxthaere project is that every time we add a new site it makes all the other sites a little bit richer.  By adding Armenia, we enhance a very interesting aspect of the project which is when you imagine the map of our world with the parallel world upon it that mental map in itself becomes an aesthetic object.  And you will have made that happen.

It helps Armenia--Although Armenia has no lack of cultural treasures this will add a unique destination for the cultural tourist.

It helps Armenia--In addition to the cultural tourism aspect, it is equally important to us that the project be inward facing as well.  And we find around the world that many of the sites become a source of local pride and that kids reimagine themselves as part of a global community.  

It helps Armenia--On a very practical level it helps Armenians because skilled laborers and artisans get work and an opportunity to showcase their gifts on an international platform 

 

It supports the project--There is nothing like Kcymaerxthaere, a unique expression of multidimensional storytelling. And it may seem a bit idealistic but we really do believe the world is a little bit better with each of our installations because it helps people to see the world fresh.   Folks who interact with this, encounter one of our installations, often begin to see possibilities.  Help us encourage that!

Excellent question.  We will still make something cool but it will be smaller.  This is why we went for the flex-funding option-our vision for the site is so extensive that even a fragment will tell an important part of the story. We will still have the opportunity to hire local Armenian artisans and craftsmen but on a smaller scale.  
 
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU RAISE TOO MUCH
We would love to have that problem and we are ready for it!  We would use it to extend the craft work (more stone for more stories) as well as for other costs of the project in Armenia, such as land and translation expenses.  In edition, we would love to commission other additional works in other media by Armenian craftspeople.  And beyond that it could support the continuation of the story in connected locations.   
 
We welcome any and all conversation and questions related to this vision.

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Crack'd Pot Ceramics is a Paint Your Own Pottery Studion in Charlotte, NC that wants to go mobile to reach out to those who cannot come to us. We'll provide you with a selection of ceramics and everything you need to decorate them. We then return the painted pottery back to you, which we glaze and fire within a week. We'll arrange to collect and deliver everything to you when and where you want it. For schools, hospitals, nursing homes, senior centers, home schoolers and other off-site events!</p>
<p>We mainly want to support the arts in the schools. Programs for music, film dance and art are in the crosshairs in most school districts. It's a familiar refrain for school art supporters, who believe they are often among the first areas to be cut when times get tough. This year, they acknowledge, new sources of money might be needed to keep school art programs viable in some communities.</p>
<p>Without art in public schools, students will potentially have less options including their time when school is not in session. Without these artistic pursuits, one effect could be an increase in home entertainment options such as computer use, video games and other such devices. While this could certainly lead to creative practices and hobbies, it risks doing so without proper learning or supervision.</p>
<p>We risk dampering our children's desire to experience and appreciate the arts later in life. This means fewer Americans visiting and supporting museums,  music and stage arts, or less demand for arts overall. Already, according to a report, fewer Americans between 18 and 24 years are attending fine arts performances or visiting museums.</p>
<p>Art is for all ages, support the art programs in your neighborhood!</p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to go mobile in my community. The things I need to make that happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>To hire at least one employee, I run my business right now by myself</li>
<li>To make sure I have enough inventory for small and large classes</li>
<li>Trade small kiln for another large kiln to handle the extra incoming bisque</li>
<li>Plastic containers to transport bisque and painting supplies</li>
<li>Upfit 2006 Scion XB to make sure it's in good health for the task for the amount of miles it will be getting traveling across the great City of Charlotte</li>
</ul><p>For making a donation to Crack'd Pot on Wheels you will receive a Paint Your Own or customized Perks of choice to you specifications. *There will be some limitations*</p>

Perhaps it is more appropriate to think of arts education as a particularly important dimension of the nation’s cultural ""ecosystem"", rather than a landscape.

<h3>About Jera Sky</h3>
<p>I'm a local artist with the ultimate goal of having my art all around the world!</p>
<p>I've been doing art for 20+ years. My mom first taught me all the years growing up, then I had a super supportive teacher in high school, Ms. Eaves and then I majored in art in college but finished with a media arts degree as the studio art system was never as supportive as my Mom or Ms. Eaves. A few years ago I was doing a lot of baground work on movies and TV, and having a lot of down time I started drawing a lot and decided to do 365 days of art. I made one piece of art each day for a year. </p>
<p>Since then I've constantly pushed myself in my art, having made a very unsucessful cartoon: PuppyDragon Land as well as so much art that I basically now just have sitting around stored in my apartment.</p>
<p>I'm basically a big kid. I love cokes and candy and chocolate (but only cokes with real sugar!) I feel like my art reflects that. </p>

<h3>The Free Painting A Day Giveaway</h3>
<p>I make too much art to list each piece and attempt to sell it. I'd rather just give it away and someone actually have and enjoy it. So thats when I decided  to give out a piece a day for as long as I could sustain it (March 6th 2012) Within 24 hours I had 40 requests for pieces. I want to be able to fulfill all requests I get, and since I'm basically a broke artist who does a lot of improv on the side, I could use some help with this project!</p>
<p>The $1200 should cover the costs for the indigogo campaign and sustain the project for at the very least 365 days (a full year!) Covering everything from shipping and packaging costs and all art supplies for those 365 pieces. By no means will I actually make any money on this $1200, it will simply allow 365+ people to have my art and keep me from going completely broke on this project. </p>
<p>Ideally if I raise more than my $1200 goal, I'd like to increase how many paintings I give away a day to 2 or more! </p>
<p>You don't even have to donate a thing to get on my free art list, but you will have to wait for your piece. </p>
<p>You can simply email jerascustombuttons@gmail.com with FREE ART REQUEST in the subject line and your address in the body to get on the list, that way I can ship out your painting when you come up on the list. </p>
<p>Everyday I post the piece I mail out on my site so you can follow as the year goes on at <a href=""http://www.JeraSky.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.JeraSky.com</a> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>No matter what you donate to me, you will get a painting from me of at least 3"" x 3"" size or greater. The larger the donation, the larger the piece (as shipping for larger pieces cost more)! </p>
<p>Listed below are all different breakdowns (titled as the presidents on those bills) and what you'll get. Trust me you won't be disappointed so long as you like the style of my art. </p>
<p>All art will be in my style as seen all over my site (<a href=""http://www.JeraSky.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.JeraSky.com</a>). I'm goofy and quirky and so is my art. Some of it is cuter and some of it is ""darker"". Definitely specify if this is going to go in a kids room or something of that nature, not that anything of mine is overly mature, but possibly too scary for a child. The more I know about you or whomever the piece is for, the better chance you will get at getting a piece you truly love! </p>

<p>OUR STORY</p>
<p>Pepatian has three main events in Spring 2012:</p>
<p>1)   BX-RATED: LA MEZCLATINA RISING  - a dance theater collaboration with artists JESSIE FLORES, NADIA HALLGREN, CARIDAD DE LA LUZ/LA BRUJA, CYNTHIA PANIAGUA.  This project explores issues of first and second generation Latina identity in a coming together of powerful, unapologetic voices that speak to personal journeys and female realities in the tight rope between urban life and ancestry. The artists have two month-long residencies and three informal showings in Spring 2012 (this work will have its final premiere in Spring 2013);</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2)   BRONX HIP-HOP ACADEMY - acclaimed teaching artists: CRYSTAL CLARITY (Visual Art), ROKAFELLA (Dance), LA BRUJA (Spoken Word), and DJ FRED ONES (Music) provide workshops culminating in a performance opportunity for teens at BronxWorks. This project also includes an Entrepreneurship Seminar led by Business Advisor, Prince Thomas, from the Small Business Development Office at Lehman College;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3)  PROJECT LAUNCH: PISO and HUNTS POINT HOMES</p>
<p>NOEMI SEGARRA began working on her mobile project PISO in June 2011 with dancer Marili Pizarro in Puerto Rico.  Spring 2012 marks its first presentations in NYC! </p>
<p>Also introduced in Spring 2012 is the very beginning of a new collaborative project entitled HUNTS POINT HOMES, with choreographers/dancers: ALICIA DIAZ and MATTHEW THORNTON, MARION RAMIREZ and JUNG WOONG KIM.</p>
<p>These two individual projects are introduced in Spring 2012 at various sites in NYC and the Bronx, including a shared evening at Danspace Project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE IMPACT</p>
<p>These three projects are very important to Pepatian and the 14 participating artists.</p>
<p>We need your help to ensure that these events are all properly funded and supported.</p>
<p>We aim to raise $3500 for Pepatian Spring 2012 events.</p>
<p>Each of the three projects (BX-RATED, BRONX HIP-HOP ACADEMY, Spring 2012 launch of PISO and HUNTS POINT HOMES) will get $1000, and $500 will cover admin and office supplies for Spring 2012. </p>

<h3>Hi--I'm<strong> Diana Heyne, an American professional artist currently residing and traveling in France. I have a passion for art that draws our attention to both the magical qualities of the natural world and the mystery of what lies within the human mind and heart. I have spent many years exploring cultural history, mythology, folklore and natural science to support the conceptual basis of my art while studying widely in the realm of materials and techniques so that I can work with media as varied as sound installation and mask making or drawing and puppetry. I have an extensive exhibition and performance background in the US and Europe and I hold a batchelor of fine arts degree with honors from Virginia Commonwealth University School of The Arts.  An important component of my art is directly engaging others through teaching and my<strong> experience includes an adjunct professorship, Waldorf kindergarten and workshops for museums and cultural institutions. I spent five years as an artist with the nationally acclaimed US atelier, Applied Imagination, making and installing ""botanical architecture"" (miniatures in natural materials) for large exhibitions at the New York Botanical Gardens, the National Botanical Gardens in Washington and other well known arboretums and botanical gardens across the country. Here in France I create art and street theatre and sell my work online via my Etsy shops and website. For more information on my art and travels:<br/></strong></strong>

<h3><strong>My campaign seeks to raise funds to purchase a dependable used van in order to more successfully transport the objects, tools and materials needed to teach workshops, perform and provide a ""home on wheels"" when needed. With all of this I would be able to teach and perform more extensively in Europe and the UK than is now possible. Funds would be used to cover van purchase, simple renovation of interior space for living and eventual external transformation to a work of art on wheels. I am particularly fond of the magical caravans and vardos used by traveling carnivals and nomadic folk of the past and would like to create something of this ambiance with the ""outer skin"" of my transport, albeit using recycled materials and affordable art techniques. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>In the enchanted realm workshops that I teach we make miniature furniture, houses and puppet figures in twigs, bark, pods and other found objects. Workshops are open to all ages--a bit out of the ordinary but a very successful sharing of energy and skills. I strive to encourage closer connection to the natural world and its beauty through the use of organic materials and heightened imagination. Storytelling is a natural extension of the process of making. We experience relaxed observation of the world of forest and field and even nature pushing up through concrete in the urban realm, merging with recycled bits to transform cast-offs to artistic treasure. Participants work with found forms to create an enchanting and relaxing miniature realm that provides a place of calm and creative satisfaction. Children are encouraged to spend more time out of doors. All ages can be engaged by the simple magic of shadow figures or marionettes and the timeless beauty of storytelling. We are all enriched by the surprising things that happen when people become still and listen to nature.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong> I'm asking for your help to bring a program of participatory arts and nature to a greater audience but I'm also offering you gifts in return to show my gratitude. These range from photo cards of my popular natural material miniature caravans through art prints of cut paper shadow puppets, to original art shadow boxes valued at $200. So you can enjoy art as well as support it! For those of you who aren't able to provide financial support you can still help to get the word out by sharing this link on Facebook and other social media as well as among your friends. To everyone who takes the time to read and look I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Please know that even if the campaign here doesn't reach its goal in full, I will continue to pursue support by all possible means and all funds will be used to provide appropriate transportation to teaching and performing venues.<br/></strong></h3>

<p>Hi! I’m Cedra Wood, a visual artist living in New Mexico.</p>
<p>I’m excited and honored to have been invited to join <a href=""http://www.thearcticcircle.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Arctic Circle 2012</a>, an international residency program that invites artists, scientists, writers, musicians, and educators to the Arctic to conduct investigative work. For nearly three weeks, the other residents and I will sail together on an ice class barkentine tallship, exploring Svalbard, a High Arctic archipelago just ten degrees from the North Pole, observing, creating, and collaborating as we go.</p>
<p>In addition to being a life-changing personal experience, this trip holds untold potential for the enrichment/development of my work. As one element of my painting practice, I insinuate myself into natural environments, sometimes mimicking the tactics of other, better-adapted creatures, yielding imagery that is by turns comical, wistful, discomfiting, and surreal; these performances allow me to address ideas of belonging, isolation, and survival through metaphor. You can imagine how being immersed in such an extreme, unfamiliar environment will inform the images that I create. Another facet of my project will be to maintain a detailed, handwritten travelogue, in keeping with the history of Arctic explorers.</p>
<p>I have a few places to go alone on the journey, before and after the official residency. In order to acquaint myself with the history and current focus of Polar travel, I’ll spend several days at the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, and attend the British Antarctic Society’s <em>UK Antarctic Science Conference</em>. Following the residency, having returned to Oslo from Svalbard, I’d like to take a ferry all the way up the coast of Norway—from Bergen to Kirkenes—painting and documenting along the way. From there I hope to bus into Russia and attend a conference in Murmansk—<em>Integrated Researches of Spitzbergen Nature</em>—which ideally will provide a useful context for the natural phenomena I will recently have experienced firsthand.</p>
<p>I’ve received a grant from the <a href=""http://www.harwoodartcenter.org/ss/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Harwood</a> Emerging Artist Fund to offset the cost of ice-worthy art supplies, and have scraped up enough on my own to pay for the residency’s fees, plus the flight that will get me from Oslo to Svalbard, but I’m still in serious need of funding for a number of other things, including airfare from the US to the UK, then home to the US from Russia; the myriad other train, boat, bus, and plane rides that will get me from place to place while abroad; vital items of cold-weather gear; an archival handmade book in which to keep my travelogue; and three weeks’ worth of modest meals and hostel fees—plus the less interesting but inevitable miscellaneous expenses that crop up while preparing for such a trip (visas, a new camera battery, travel insurance, electrical adapter, etc).</p>

<strong>ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN</strong> </h2>
<p>The Crystal Brush Awards are a fantastic opportunity for anyone who is professionally involved in the world of miniature painting. Unfortunately, <strong>the trip to Chicago from Spain carries an economic effort hardly acceptable for me. Air tickets and stay cost came close to $1300</strong>.</p>
<p>For this reason I am asking for your help to support me and my adventure in this year´s Awards, and why not, try to win any of the grand prizes kindly provided by CoolMiniOrNot and the <a href=""http://www.crystalbrush.com/sponsors/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Crystal Brush sponsors</a>.</p>
<p>In return, I offer you the opportunity to get some rewards that I am sure will be very interesting, most of them focus on learning about miniature painting.</p>
<p>I can´t yet reveal nothing about my two projects in competition, but I can say something: Will be awesome!!. One will be a diorama based in the zombie world with several 70 Mm. figures, and the other will have two 90 Mm. Orc figures, based on the Warhammer 40k. universe.</p>

</div>","ABOUT ME
My name is Enrique Velasco, also known as emuse. I am a professional freelance miniature painter from Spain. I have collaborated with many manufacturers and collectors from around the world and have garnered awards and recognition for my work, both domestic and international.
With strong influences of film, comic, illustration, History and 80´s and 90´s popular culture. All these influences are captured in some ideas that attempt to express in my works.
 

 
ABOUT THE CHICAGO CRYSTAL BRUSH AWARDS
The Crystal Brush Awards are meant to celebrate the fascinating and fantastic hobby of miniature painting. These awards are created and organized by CoolMiniOrNot.com.
With a large grand prize, and beautiful trophies, CMON hope that with the support of the miniature painting community this will be the event for miniatures enthusiasts everywhere!
Internet voting will be conducted at CoolMiniOrNot.com and CrystalBrush.com and will comprise 50% of the final score of each entry. The other 50% will comprise of a panel of judges selected from industry professionals and AdeptiCon staff.
The third Crystal Brush Awards will be held April 21 2013 at AdeptiCon 2013 in Chicago.

 

ABOUT THIS CAMPAIGN 
The Crystal Brush Awards are a fantastic opportunity for anyone who is professionally involved in the world of miniature painting. Unfortunately, the trip to Chicago from Spain carries an economic effort hardly acceptable for me. Air tickets and stay cost came close to $1300.
For this reason I am asking for your help to support me and my adventure in this year´s Awards, and why not, try to win any of the grand prizes kindly provided by CoolMiniOrNot and the Crystal Brush sponsors.
In return, I offer you the opportunity to get some rewards that I am sure will be very interesting, most of them focus on learning about miniature painting.
I can´t yet reveal nothing about my two projects in competition, but I can say something: Will be awesome!!. One will be a diorama based in the zombie world with several 70 Mm. figures, and the other will have two 90 Mm. Orc figures, based on the Warhammer 40k. universe.

<h3>THE GRIDBOARD</h3>Hey everybody! This is the Gridboard. It is an entirely innovative cruiser deck, made of 100 % carbon-fiber – a super lightweight high-tech material that is mainly used in the aviation and automotive sectors, which makes the Gridboard lighter than common cruisers. The grid makes the unique, outstanding design. By the way, the Gridboard has been awarded for its innovative material use - the MATERIALICA product silver award! </span>
</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The gridboard is also nominated for the German Design Award 2016. Keep your fingers crossed for us.</div>

<p>We are fully committed to realizing the project Gridboard because we believe  in this brand new cruiser deck with all our designers' passion.</p>
We already made several prototypes in our workshop, tested and confirmed by handpicked longboarders of the local scene.<br/>Currently we are about to go into mass production, therefore we are already cooperating with a manufacturer who is now preparing the pre production. <br/>

THE GRIDBOARDHey everybody! This is the Gridboard. It is an entirely innovative cruiser deck, made of 100 % carbon-fiber – a super lightweight high-tech material that is mainly used in the aviation and automotive sectors, which makes the Gridboard lighter than common cruisers. The grid makes the unique, outstanding design. By the way, the Gridboard has been awarded for its innovative material use - the MATERIALICA product silver award! 

The gridboard is also nominated for the German Design Award 2016. Keep your fingers crossed for us.



We are fully committed to realizing the project Gridboard because we believe  in this brand new cruiser deck with all our designers' passion.
We already made several prototypes in our workshop, tested and confirmed by handpicked longboarders of the local scene.Currently we are about to go into mass production, therefore we are already cooperating with a manufacturer who is now preparing the pre production. 
With your support you help us financing the pilot series.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Timeless Motion in brief.</span><br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<b><i>Timeless Motion</i></b> is a gallery exhibition featuring cinematic installations by seven artists (<strong>Paul Clipson, Keith Evans, Kerry Laitala, Jeanne Liotta, Kathleen Quillian, Scott Stark and Mark Wilson</strong>) that reveals the science and magic behind cinema. Using photography, collage, drawing, film, sculptural installation and projected light, the exhibition shows how moving image art is created and how the human response to visual phenomena drives the illusion of movement. The exhibition<b> </b>was organized as part of SOMArts Gallery's 2015-16 curatorial residency program and will be on view <strong>February 18—March 23, 2016 </strong>at <b>SOMArts Gallery</b> in San Francisco.<strong></strong> All funds donated to this campaign will be processed through our fiscal sponsor Artists' Television Access.</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>Our vision is big. We need your help to make it happen.<br/>
</h3> <p>As a one-time exhibition, we generally fall outside the scope of most institutional funders. But our vision is big and we have a lot things we want to do with this project--including workshops, a panel discussion and 3 expanded cinema programs--to further engage interested community members in exploring the history and techniques involved in experimental and moving image art.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $7500 through this crowd-sourced fundraising campaign. The money will be used to directly support the creation of work, both in the gallery exhibition and related events. We have a ton of great gifts: DVDs, prints, photographs, collages and more, all made by the exhibiting artists as a way to thank you for your support of our work and vision. </p> </div> <div> <h3>More about us and the exhibition.<br/>
</h3> <p>All of the artists in this exhibition have long and involved histories of exhibiting and participating in the experimental film community. This exhibition is a way for us to further explore themes and elements in our respective practices in a gallery context, a new way of thinking and working for many of us. Through <i>Timeless Motion</i> we intend to bridge two distinct exhibition contexts, the black box of the theater and the white box of the gallery.  <br/></p>
<p>The exhibition will consist of cinematic installations and artworks created with the basic elements of moving image art.  The components of moving image phenomena will be laid out in their most fundamental forms. From sequential still images to flickering archival imagery, to scintillating light and shadow, the audience will engage with the illusion of cinema and understand how the human response to visual phenomena creates the magical perception of movement. <br/></p>
<p><b>Kerry Laitala</b>’s para-cinematic devices reveal the mechanics of cinema as larger-than-life kinetic sculptures. <b>Kathleen Quillian</b>’s work in animation relies on the composition and construction of a series of still images to create the illusion of motion. <b>Paul Clipson</b>’s film installation reconfigures the experience of the moving image through an immersive, boundless sea of sound, light and image. <b>Mark Wilson</b> uses drawing and printmaking to zero in on the details of moving image work. <b>Scott Stark</b> explores the spectacle of light and movement in a cinematic installation made from industrial and organic material. <b>Keith Evans</b> paracinematic ecologies integrate A/V media and unusual sculptural elements to construct an integrated, organic, microcosmic universe. <b>Jeanne Liotta</b>'s installation illustrates the complexity of the spacetime continuum. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Complementing the <i>Timeless Motion</i> exhibition are a series of events and workshops including <b>three expanded cinema programs</b> of live film and music collaborations, a <b>panel discussion</b> celebrating the history of underground cinema in the Bay Area with film artists, scholars and curators who have been key participants and witnesses to the movement and <b>two workshops</b> that will introduce participants to resources and techniques integral to the creative process of moving image art, including cut-out animation and hand exposed camera-less filmmaking (or cinegrams).</p>
<p>As long-time members of the Bay Area experimental film community, we have extensive experience working together in various capacities, including organizing screenings, workshops and exhibitions both with and for each other. We have served in administrative capacities as staff and board members at many of the Bay Area’s most notable institutions dedicated to experimental film and video including the San Francisco Art Institute, SFMoMA, San Francisco Cinematheque, Canyon Cinema, Oddball Cinema, the Prelinger Archives, Artists’ Television Access and Shapeshifters Cinema. In between running our own organizations, we also create and exhibit our own work in screenings and festivals around the world including SF International Film Festival, International Film Festival Rotterdam and the Whitney Biennial, to name a few. We know what it takes to make a great exhibition and we are pooling together all of our know-how to make the <i>Timeless Motion</i> exhibition one to remember.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Timeless Motion in brief.
 
Timeless Motion is a gallery exhibition featuring cinematic installations by seven artists (Paul Clipson, Keith Evans, Kerry Laitala, Jeanne Liotta, Kathleen Quillian, Scott Stark and Mark Wilson) that reveals the science and magic behind cinema. Using photography, collage, drawing, film, sculptural installation and projected light, the exhibition shows how moving image art is created and how the human response to visual phenomena drives the illusion of movement. The exhibition was organized as part of SOMArts Gallery's 2015-16 curatorial residency program and will be on view February 18—March 23, 2016 at SOMArts Gallery in San Francisco. All funds donated to this campaign will be processed through our fiscal sponsor Artists' Television Access.  Our vision is big. We need your help to make it happen.
 As a one-time exhibition, we generally fall outside the scope of most institutional funders. But our vision is big and we have a lot things we want to do with this project--including workshops, a panel discussion and 3 expanded cinema programs--to further engage interested community members in exploring the history and techniques involved in experimental and moving image art.  
Our goal is to raise $7500 through this crowd-sourced fundraising campaign. The money will be used to directly support the creation of work, both in the gallery exhibition and related events. We have a ton of great gifts: DVDs, prints, photographs, collages and more, all made by the exhibiting artists as a way to thank you for your support of our work and vision.    More about us and the exhibition.
 All of the artists in this exhibition have long and involved histories of exhibiting and participating in the experimental film community. This exhibition is a way for us to further explore themes and elements in our respective practices in a gallery context, a new way of thinking and working for many of us. Through Timeless Motion we intend to bridge two distinct exhibition contexts, the black box of the theater and the white box of the gallery.  
The exhibition will consist of cinematic installations and artworks created with the basic elements of moving image art.  The components of moving image phenomena will be laid out in their most fundamental forms. From sequential still images to flickering archival imagery, to scintillating light and shadow, the audience will engage with the illusion of cinema and understand how the human response to visual phenomena creates the magical perception of movement. 
Kerry Laitala’s para-cinematic devices reveal the mechanics of cinema as larger-than-life kinetic sculptures. Kathleen Quillian’s work in animation relies on the composition and construction of a series of still images to create the illusion of motion. Paul Clipson’s film installation reconfigures the experience of the moving image through an immersive, boundless sea of sound, light and image. Mark Wilson uses drawing and printmaking to zero in on the details of moving image work. Scott Stark explores the spectacle of light and movement in a cinematic installation made from industrial and organic material. Keith Evans paracinematic ecologies integrate A/V media and unusual sculptural elements to construct an integrated, organic, microcosmic universe. Jeanne Liotta's installation illustrates the complexity of the spacetime continuum. 

Complementing the Timeless Motion exhibition are a series of events and workshops including three expanded cinema programs of live film and music collaborations, a panel discussion celebrating the history of underground cinema in the Bay Area with film artists, scholars and curators who have been key participants and witnesses to the movement and two workshops that will introduce participants to resources and techniques integral to the creative process of moving image art, including cut-out animation and hand exposed camera-less filmmaking (or cinegrams).
As long-time members of the Bay Area experimental film community, we have extensive experience working together in various capacities, including organizing screenings, workshops and exhibitions both with and for each other. We have served in administrative capacities as staff and board members at many of the Bay Area’s most notable institutions dedicated to experimental film and video including the San Francisco Art Institute, SFMoMA, San Francisco Cinematheque, Canyon Cinema, Oddball Cinema, the Prelinger Archives, Artists’ Television Access and Shapeshifters Cinema. In between running our own organizations, we also create and exhibit our own work in screenings and festivals around the world including SF International Film Festival, International Film Festival Rotterdam and the Whitney Biennial, to name a few. We know what it takes to make a great exhibition and we are pooling together all of our know-how to make the Timeless Motion exhibition one to remember.

</div></div>","Hello, i'm fundraising for SkatePal, I need money to buy materials to build a skatepark in Palestine.


My name is Joshua Perkin, I work as a freelance writer and artist in Barcelona. 

 At the end of August this year i'm going to spend two months in Asria El Shamalyia, near Nablus. I'm going with a small team of volunteers to build a skatepark , with a registered charity called skatePal.

Due
to the political situation in Palestine, areas such as sport and art are often
underfunded and neglected, and this non-for-profit charity will bring something with no ulterior motives other than fun to the town. 
No focus on sexes, no focus on ages, no focus on religious or political beliefs. Just something that is centred around personal progression to be enjoyed by anyone. 


What We Need & What You Get

 We need to raise a total of £18,000.00 for the skatepark alone, so every penny is going to help. For each contribution, you will receive a piece of my handmade art.  
Where the money will go:

1. Construction materials: lumber, concrete, gravel, water facilities
2. Construction equipment: power tools, digger, buckets, shovels, 
3. Skateboarding equipment: elbow pads, knee pads,helmets, skate shoes, skateboard trucks, skateboard decks.
4. Transportation costs. 
What you can chose to receive:
£8


- A hand
made Tote bag, made from quality materials with a custom printed design. 

£18

- A hand made Tote bag
- An exclusive print of an original painting.

£25

- A hand made Tote bag
- An exclusive print of
an original painting
- A one off original hand painted tile

£100

- 
A one off original 40cm/30cm mixed
media painting

£200

- 
A commissioned
70cm/50cm painting – choose your own concept
The Impact

 
The difference that you will make to the children of Palestine will be huge... somewhere to play, somewhere to feel equal, somewhere to be free.
  Risks & Challenges In terms of the ongoing conflict in Gaza...SkatePAL has been running successfully for over three years and has kept the participants safe through last years' conflict. The guide and director, Charlie frequently visits the OPT and has travelled extensively across Israel and Palestine, has met with local authorities to ensure as safe an environment as possible.
This is a non-for-profit charity, that means that myself and everyone else involved is taking a lot of time out of their working lives to go and work for a cause in which we collectively believe. This is why we need your help. 
    Other Ways You Can Help SPEAD THE WORD!

<h3></h3>
<h3>Our Story:</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are a group
of five women (Sarah, Paddi, Jessi, Shelley and Eleanor) who came together when
we realized that we have all dreamed of seeing a creativity-focused studio that
is open to the public. We dreamed of a space where members of the community
(like you) can come gather, create art and support one another in a safe, welcoming and sustainable space. This space can be the catalyst for greater change in our
community, in the social fabric and the physical fabric. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This community studio
is for everyone, regardless of artistic ability or background, and each
person’s unique contribution is appreciated and needed. Together with the
community, we envision a vibrant and inspiring grassroots studio space that
will help members along their creative path. We have found in our own lives
that creative self-expression and art making helps and heals by giving a
feeling of possibility, hope and empowerment. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">We see magpies as collectors of potential. They see
discarded items as gems, building their nest sculptures by finding the shiny
bits of meaning in them. We see ourselves as magpies, looking for meaning in
the every day, and taking those discarded items to upcycle them into something
new, beautiful and functional. Magpies are known to be one of the most
intelligent species of animal, and are even able to learn to use tools. Perhaps they
would make crafts given the chance! By focusing on upcycling, we help to divert waste from landfills, and turn junk into beauty.</p>
<h3>Where You Come In:</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Grassroots funding is our current focus, and is also
where you come in. We have been looking for funding to open a studio for you to
join us and create! So far, we have been hosting free, monthly pop-ups,
including nature art, assemblage from discarded materials, fabric collage,
painted fabric circle murals and flower printmaking. In the works for the
coming months, we have chopstick mobiles, upcycled creations, collage,
silhouettes, and an embroidered community map. We welcome your feedback, and please
let us know what you would like to see in the future! The funding we have
received thus far has gone to pay for supplies for our workshops. We
have received a Neighbourhood Small Grant, a Community Partners Grant, and a
grant from East Feast through Britannia Community Centre. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">As a new not-for-profit group, the funding we are seeking
is difficult to access. We also realize that our supporters and community are
our greatest resource. Some of you have been asking how you can help, and now
we can answer you. We are starting this grassroots fundraising campaign, with the
goal of raising enough money for our first 3 months rent in our studio space. This approach makes sense,
because rather than relying on big funders, we can get a little (or a lot, we
will also be thrilled with a lot!) help from a large number of people in order
to have sustainable and diversified funding. We will also be holding a benefit concert as a culminating celebration of this campaign, so stay tuned!</p>
<h3>We are asking for:</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">$1500/month rent</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">$300/month utilities and expenses</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">$750/month honorariums and workshop facilitators</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">for 3 months =$7650</p>
<h3>You will get:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">-A space to feel at home, meet your neighbours and explore your own creativity</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">-A hand-embroidered leaf honouring you ($25) a surprise craft kit mailed to you ($50) and a FREE workshop of your choice ($100) </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">-A sense of joy!</span></p>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>We believe that we can be a place for families and individuals in the community to build self-confidence, relationships, and to come and work together as equals. The
space will become a safe and trustworthy community hub and can be a
remedy for the loneliness and isolation felt by many members of our community, as evidenced in this Vancouver Foundation report: <a href=""http://www.straight.com/news/vancouver-study-city-loneliness-and-unfriendliness"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.straight.com/news/vancouver-study-city-loneliness-and-unfriendliness</a>.
It is important to us that we work together as a true community,
inter-generationally, and with people from different backgrounds and
experiences. Creative art and craft is the perfect way to share and learn from people we might not
necessarily meet otherwise, and transcends language. By working alongside your neighbours, the community and every day interactions will be enriched.</p>
<p>This start-up fund will help us to get an initial nest egg, until we open (planned for October 2013). We will become self sustaining by selling studio memberships, operating a storefront shop, gallery, small cafe, and generating revenue from special
workshops and studio rentals. We will be documenting our activities to share with you, and with bigger funders. We see this start-up fund as the catalyst for our future grant success! We want to make this space as affordable as possible, so that there are no barriers to creating art. </p>

have received a Neighbourhood Small Grant, a Community Partners Grant, and a
grant from East Feast through Britannia Community Centre. 
As a new not-for-profit group, the funding we are seeking
is difficult to access. We also realize that our supporters and community are
our greatest resource. Some of you have been asking how you can help, and now
we can answer you. We are starting this grassroots fundraising campaign, with the
goal of raising enough money for our first 3 months rent in our studio space. This approach makes sense,
because rather than relying on big funders, we can get a little (or a lot, we
will also be thrilled with a lot!) help from a large number of people in order
to have sustainable and diversified funding. We will also be holding a benefit concert as a culminating celebration of this campaign, so stay tuned!
We are asking for:
$1500/month rent
$300/month utilities and expenses
$750/month honorariums and workshop facilitators
for 3 months =$7650
You will get:

-A space to feel at home, meet your neighbours and explore your own creativity
-A hand-embroidered leaf honouring you ($25) a surprise craft kit mailed to you ($50) and a FREE workshop of your choice ($100) 
-A sense of joy!
The Impact

We believe that we can be a place for families and individuals in the community to build self-confidence, relationships, and to come and work together as equals. The
space will become a safe and trustworthy community hub and can be a
remedy for the loneliness and isolation felt by many members of our community, as evidenced in this Vancouver Foundation report: http://www.straight.com/news/vancouver-study-city-loneliness-and-unfriendliness.
It is important to us that we work together as a true community,
inter-generationally, and with people from different backgrounds and
experiences. Creative art and craft is the perfect way to share and learn from people we might not
necessarily meet otherwise, and transcends language. By working alongside your neighbours, the community and every day interactions will be enriched.
This start-up fund will help us to get an initial nest egg, until we open (planned for October 2013). We will become self sustaining by selling studio memberships, operating a storefront shop, gallery, small cafe, and generating revenue from special
workshops and studio rentals. We will be documenting our activities to share with you, and with bigger funders. We see this start-up fund as the catalyst for our future grant success! We want to make this space as affordable as possible, so that there are no barriers to creating art.

Here's how it works: </div><div>For every $20 raised through our campaign on Tuesday, December 3rd only, Indiegogo will match $1! So please support us on #GivingTuesday as we promote +More WoCA in 2014! Thanks in advance for your support!</div><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Since WoCA Projects opened in February 2013, we have had a very successful run of exhibitions and programming. Our mission was to highlight the contemporary art by women artists of color and artists of diverse backgrounds through exhibitions and community arts programming. Our initial goal was to have at least 4 exhibitions this year, and we accomplished that and then some while nearly 2 months shy of our 1 year anniversary! Here are some key accomplishments that we've made within our first year:</p><ul>
<li>featured over emerging and established 30 artists through both solo, group, and juried exhibitions.</li>
<li>featured a total of approximately 10 exhibitions (solo, group, and juried) with accompanying opening receptions and event programming.</li>
<li>partnered with local youth arts academy to feature over 100+ student works.</li>
<li>started a monthly ""Afternoon Teas @ WoCA"" event series, featuring women leaders in the arts.</li>
<li>advocated and promoted the works of featured artists to area collectors, curators, and institutions.</li>
<li>created positive visibility and exposure for our featured artists and local arts community!</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>+ MORE WoCA in 2014 </h3><p>We have big plans for 2014 and as we enter our second year of exhibitions and programming we are ready to kick things up a notch! The + More Campaign is all about vision casting and helping us to continue our mission to highlight contemporary art by women artists of color and diverse artists of all backgrounds. We have more exhibitions and programming that we'd like to offer and more artists, creative entrepreneurs, arts leaders, and arts educators both locally and nationally that we'd like to bring in to support our local arts community. Here is what your contribution will do:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>Our goal is to raise $15,000,</b> which will cover our operational and programming costs for the year. This amount covers the base level costs of our exhibition space, marketing/promotion, exhibition expenses, opening receptions, and programming events. And remember, the more we raise the more we will be able to do!</li>
<li>
<b>As a thank you for supporting our campaign we have some amazing perks available</b>, such as, postcard/email blast announcements, a WoCA notebook, tickets to our Afternoon Teas @ WoCA event, or having your name/organization on our contributors wall during exhibitions, and much more!</li>
<li>
<b>Our campaign is flexible, so all monies that are contributed will go to our project. </b>Even if we don't raise our entire goal (eventhough we really hope we do!), every dollar raised will be used towards operational and programming costs. Not raising our goal just makes it that much harder to fund all of the cool exhibitions and programs we have planned for 2014.</li>
<li>
<b>Your contribution is tax-deductible! </b>WoCA Projects is a fiscally sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization, and therefore your contribution is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Note: Your Tax-deductible contribution is minus the value of any perks you receive by participating in this campaign (i.e., For $25 contribution: Perk received: WoCA Notebook, value is $8; Tax-deductible amount: $17).</li>

Let us tell you why:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>Your contribution allows us to create exhibition opportunities for artists</b>! With your help we are able to expose the art world to emerging, mid-career, and established artists to our local arts community. </li>
<li>
<b>Your contribution is going towards a quality arts program.</b> Within a short period of time, our exhibitions and programs have become highly regarded within our local community. Your contribution will be a part of an effort that is doing great things not just for artists but for the local community and young student artists.</li>
<li>
<b>We need you! </b>Your contribution matters because it takes people like you to make great things happen. WoCA would not exist without the help of supporters, so without you we can not continue to do our work in the community.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Even if you are not able to contribute to our campaign there are still so many ways you can help our effort:</p><ul>

Here's how it works: For every $20 raised through our campaign on Tuesday, December 3rd only, Indiegogo will match $1! So please support us on #GivingTuesday as we promote +More WoCA in 2014! Thanks in advance for your support!Short SummarySince WoCA Projects opened in February 2013, we have had a very successful run of exhibitions and programming. Our mission was to highlight the contemporary art by women artists of color and artists of diverse backgrounds through exhibitions and community arts programming. Our initial goal was to have at least 4 exhibitions this year, and we accomplished that and then some while nearly 2 months shy of our 1 year anniversary! Here are some key accomplishments that we've made within our first year:
featured over emerging and established 30 artists through both solo, group, and juried exhibitions.
featured a total of approximately 10 exhibitions (solo, group, and juried) with accompanying opening receptions and event programming.
partnered with local youth arts academy to feature over 100+ student works.
started a monthly ""Afternoon Teas @ WoCA"" event series, featuring women leaders in the arts.
advocated and promoted the works of featured artists to area collectors, curators, and institutions.
created positive visibility and exposure for our featured artists and local arts community!
+ MORE WoCA in 2014 We have big plans for 2014 and as we enter our second year of exhibitions and programming we are ready to kick things up a notch! The + More Campaign is all about vision casting and helping us to continue our mission to highlight contemporary art by women artists of color and diverse artists of all backgrounds. We have more exhibitions and programming that we'd like to offer and more artists, creative entrepreneurs, arts leaders, and arts educators both locally and nationally that we'd like to bring in to support our local arts community. Here is what your contribution will do:

Our goal is to raise $15,000, which will cover our operational and programming costs for the year. This amount covers the base level costs of our exhibition space, marketing/promotion, exhibition expenses, opening receptions, and programming events. And remember, the more we raise the more we will be able to do!

As a thank you for supporting our campaign we have some amazing perks available, such as, postcard/email blast announcements, a WoCA notebook, tickets to our Afternoon Teas @ WoCA event, or having your name/organization on our contributors wall during exhibitions, and much more!

Our campaign is flexible, so all monies that are contributed will go to our project. Even if we don't raise our entire goal (eventhough we really hope we do!), every dollar raised will be used towards operational and programming costs. Not raising our goal just makes it that much harder to fund all of the cool exhibitions and programs we have planned for 2014.

Your contribution is tax-deductible! WoCA Projects is a fiscally sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization, and therefore your contribution is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Note: Your Tax-deductible contribution is minus the value of any perks you receive by participating in this campaign (i.e., For $25 contribution: Perk received: WoCA Notebook, value is $8; Tax-deductible amount: $17).
For a contribution of $25 you will receive a big thank you and a WoCA notebook!For a contribution of $100 you will receive a WoCA notebook + be listed as a WoCA Champion on our exhibition sponsors wall and on our website.For a contribution of $250 you will receive a WoCA notebook + be listed as a WoCA Major Exhibition Sponsor on our exhibition sponsors wall and on our website + 2 tickets to attend one of our monthly Afternoon Teas @ WoCA events. Afternoon Teas @ WoCA are every 2nd Saturday of the month ( except January 2014).For a contribution of $1000 you will receive a WoCA notebook + be listed as a Major Exhibition Sponsor on our exhibition sponsors wall and on our website + 2 tickets to attend one of our monthly Afternoon Teas @ WoCA events + host a private meeting/reception in our space for approximately 40 people  + have the change to sit on our advisor committee and give advice and input on programming and community outreach for the space.Why Your Contribution Matters?Your contribution makes a difference! Let us tell you why:

Your contribution allows us to create exhibition opportunities for artists! With your help we are able to expose the art world to emerging, mid-career, and established artists to our local arts community. 

Your contribution is going towards a quality arts program. Within a short period of time, our exhibitions and programs have become highly regarded within our local community. Your contribution will be a part of an effort that is doing great things not just for artists but for the local community and young student artists.

We need you! Your contribution matters because it takes people like you to make great things happen. WoCA would not exist without the help of supporters, so without you we can not continue to do our work in the community.

<h3>Why Should I Fund Deez's Birthday Extravaganza?</h3>
<p>Deez is not only an awesome person who strives his hardest to provide joy and happiness to everyone he possibly can, he is also extremely selfless and giving.  Here are some examples of some of the philanthropic activities Deez has contributed to society:</p>
<ul>
<li>He has donated to charities.</li>
<li>He has volunteered at Animal Shelters.</li>
<li>He has done Americorps work and staffed several teen-focused substance abuse prevention projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Long story short, Deez is a nice guy who is waiting for karma to come back around and deserves to have a positively memorable birthday!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Does Deez Need &amp; What Do I Get?</h3>
<p>Here's how it's going down.  All the money that is donated towards this project is dedicated to my birthday celebration, whether I meet the goal or not.  The total goal is what I need for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air fare to and lodging in Cincinnati: nothing fancy, flying coach and Holiday Inn.</li>
<li>The VIP package for the SuicideGirls Blackheart Burlesque show.</li>
<li>Cab fare and very basic food necessities.</li>
</ul>But Deez, what happens if you don't hit your goal by the deadline (a week before Deez's b-day)?  Let me tell you!  If I do not hit that goal all funds will go towards:<div>
<br/><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The VIP Package for the SuicideGirls Blackheart Burlesque show within closest driving distance.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Food, gas and lodging for the event.</span></li>
<li>Extra special treats for donors if I receive more than I need!</li>
</ul>
<div>Okay, Deez, I know what you get out of this: an awesome fucking birthday.  What do I, as a donor, get out of making a donation to this cause?  It's a good thing you asked!  Anyone who donates towards this cause will get a free pass to a special passworded bath show that I will do from my hotel room after the Burlesque Show.  Other <b>awesome</b> donation perks are offered by donation price.</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How Will This Impact Deez's Life?</h3>
<p>At risk of sounding like a pity-party, let me explain why this birthday extravaganza would deeply enrich Deez's life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deez has never seen a Burlesque show in his life and is very eager to experience this first-hand for the first time.</li>
<li>Deez works from home, lives alone in the middle of nowhere and is starving for real-life social interaction.</li>
<li>Deez's family hasn't really celebrated birthdays in about 10 years; if he doesn't go to the show he will either be on cam or at home alone.</li>
<li>Deez has never had a truly, positively memorable birthday experience in all of the almost 27 years of his life.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute monetarily, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't help good ol' Deez out.  Here are some other ways to help Deez:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word about Deez's Burlesque B-Day to people that you think <i>could</i> and <i>would</i> contribute monetarily.</li>

<h3>We Need Your Help!</h3>
<p>We are a small art/animation studio (Jazza Studios) and also a YouTube channel, (Draw With Jazza). For any of you that know Jazza you all understand the type of guy he is, incredibly genuine, self depreciating, hopeful, positive and full of creativity (he didn't write this, by the way, Mrs Jazza did). He hopes that through the channel he communicates his message 'Art is an Adventure Playground for Everyone' and if you were to ask him he would 100% say that all he wants is to encourage and support others in their art. </p>
<p>It is hard to keep a small art setup going, keep delivering free content and compete with large studios, production companies and networks, with their money and equipment. We need help to stay current and deliver ambitious content - We need a better space to film in. Because we are small and with the matching small financial resources (but we try and think big), we are looking at our Garden Shed, only at the moment it has holes in and it is a rusty wreck. We need to plug the holes and to turn it in to a great studio space, for all of us! Thank you so much for reading and for checking out our 'perks'! Any help you give is so much appreciated and will keep us delivering free stuff, online.</p>
<p>For more information regarding the details of the perks, please refer to the <a href=""https://jazzastudios.com/perks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">information page</a> we set up which explains what each perk includes, in much greater and very specific detail.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need: <i>The Studio</i><br/>What You Get: <i>Sweet Perks and Epic Content!</i>
</h3>
<p>We do not need anything flash, just a safe, dry space to make stuff, for you! We hope to have a dry (non leaky and non Floody) safe (properly reinforced and wired) medium size room with a lino floor (For art challenges, to wipe off paint), and a toilet (for Jazza Poo's, so he can stay in there longer, but he won't film the poos... I hope).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Shed Transformation Plan:</h3> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/jyFVLKJ.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p> </p>
<p>The shed is currently in <i>very poor</i> condition. Jazza tried to build himself a studio room in it but it has already flooded twice (see video) and frankly, isn't safe by a long shot. The roof has holes in it and is falling off, the gutters have the bottoms rusted out, and the surrounding concrete runs water directly into the shed! Jazza tried to waterproof his room, which only meant the water ran in and didn't leave (it sat in the room like a bowl). The electrics are not properly done (run on a cable over from the house) so to be safe they need to be put in a proper underground conduit. You will possibly have seen that Jazza picks up the tools when he can to try and get things done as cheaply as possible for the channel, but this scope of work is beyond him and we have to get some professional help.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/GCrYQJn.gif"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>We looked in to renting space for Jazza to make video content, but that would cost approximately $20,000 per year, ongoing - and that's not taking into account the additional costs for internet, electricity etc. so that is not possible for us. Instead the best way we can see to get a filming spot would be to fix the shed and we hoped that would be economical. The quotes came in a little higher than expected, but still at least we could sustain it as it is cheaper than renting year after year.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Costs: </h3>
<p><i> *Please Note: Costs shown are in Australian Dollars (AUD), however the total has been converted to USD for the campaign goal, as most of our audience reside in the US.</i></p>
<p><strong>Shed Repairs:</strong> drainage, roof, rotted wood, internal plastering $15,583.00</p>
<p><strong>Tin walls replaced with cladding:</strong> $8,337.00</p>
<p><strong>Electricity repairs to make safe:</strong> $1,500.00</p>

<h3>What your support of Draw With Jazza Means to Us: </h3>
<p>It is hard for independent video producers to keep up with large studios. They have the equipment, and they have the money and they command high prices for what they do. It is especially hard if you are a small family from a country town in Australia, with the big local power station closing down unemployment is high and funds are low. We know we can't create a professional level studio, but we believe (with hard work) we can get damn close - in our garden shed - and keep delivering you free content, even improving on the quality and variety.</p>
<p>Your support will strengthen a community with which people from all over the world participate and discover passion and excitement - a community that is positive, supportive, fun and educational. Subscribers have contacted us from the middle of war zones, or with depression, with serious illness and with bullying, and have expressed that they found something here that is worthwhile and has helped them overcome or deal with the difficulties they face. These are people Jazza has reached out to (digitally) from a country town in Australia, without even realising he has managed to help people and this has touched him deeply on many occasions. We believe strongly that art, education, and a welcoming community are for everyone. </p>
<p>To keep sustainable and keep providing content for free, we have to keep up with worldwide changes in technology and innovation - your support will help us keep making a difference and keep Draw With Jazza going, and growing!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h3>
<p>We know there will be challenges along the way, but we have a good and very reasonable builder on board. We got many quotes and did our research. We are confident that with his help and Jazza's mad handyman skills, we will be OK! You may see the return of 'HANDYMAN JAZZA!' that some of you might have seen in the vlogs. We are not afraid of hard work- Here's proof!</p>

<p>If you want to contribute but don't have the money for a perk, even a few dollars is a help - it will buy us some sand paper or something! You can also share this fundraiser on your social pages, with friends or classes, to get the word out in support of our small indie outfit! </p>

<h3>The Perks:</h3>
<p>We've thought and planned, long and hard, to create a set of perks we believe will be valuable and special to our donors. These include <strong>Signed Prints</strong> (which we have never done, and don't have plans on doing in the future), <strong>Video Calls with Jazza</strong> one on one (or with your class/club) to learn, talk or shoot the breeze, <strong>Video Collaboration</strong> with Jazza where he will work with you to create original content on his channel and thank you for your support - and yes, he is even, for the first time ever, <strong>selling his Original Artworks</strong> - he is extremely sentimental about and attached to his artwork, but he is willing to do it because a) he knows they will go to loving homes, and b) our goals and dreams for the future of the channel mean so much to him.</p>
<p>You can see a list of the available artworks/prints below - he set up a <a href=""https://jazzastudios.com/artforsale/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">web page with all of the artworks displayed individually</a>, and we have also set up a separate web page with all of the <a href=""https://jazzastudios.com/perks/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">details of the perks</a> and how they will be divvied out and distributed.</p>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/5aFWbS3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>","We Need Your Help!
We are a small art/animation studio (Jazza Studios) and also a YouTube channel, (Draw With Jazza). For any of you that know Jazza you all understand the type of guy he is, incredibly genuine, self depreciating, hopeful, positive and full of creativity (he didn't write this, by the way, Mrs Jazza did). He hopes that through the channel he communicates his message 'Art is an Adventure Playground for Everyone' and if you were to ask him he would 100% say that all he wants is to encourage and support others in their art. 
It is hard to keep a small art setup going, keep delivering free content and compete with large studios, production companies and networks, with their money and equipment. We need help to stay current and deliver ambitious content - We need a better space to film in. Because we are small and with the matching small financial resources (but we try and think big), we are looking at our Garden Shed, only at the moment it has holes in and it is a rusty wreck. We need to plug the holes and to turn it in to a great studio space, for all of us! Thank you so much for reading and for checking out our 'perks'! Any help you give is so much appreciated and will keep us delivering free stuff, online.
For more information regarding the details of the perks, please refer to the information page we set up which explains what each perk includes, in much greater and very specific detail.
 

What We Need: The StudioWhat You Get: Sweet Perks and Epic Content!

We do not need anything flash, just a safe, dry space to make stuff, for you! We hope to have a dry (non leaky and non Floody) safe (properly reinforced and wired) medium size room with a lino floor (For art challenges, to wipe off paint), and a toilet (for Jazza Poo's, so he can stay in there longer, but he won't film the poos... I hope).
 
The Shed Transformation Plan:  
The shed is currently in very poor condition. Jazza tried to build himself a studio room in it but it has already flooded twice (see video) and frankly, isn't safe by a long shot. The roof has holes in it and is falling off, the gutters have the bottoms rusted out, and the surrounding concrete runs water directly into the shed! Jazza tried to waterproof his room, which only meant the water ran in and didn't leave (it sat in the room like a bowl). The electrics are not properly done (run on a cable over from the house) so to be safe they need to be put in a proper underground conduit. You will possibly have seen that Jazza picks up the tools when he can to try and get things done as cheaply as possible for the channel, but this scope of work is beyond him and we have to get some professional help.

We looked in to renting space for Jazza to make video content, but that would cost approximately $20,000 per year, ongoing - and that's not taking into account the additional costs for internet, electricity etc. so that is not possible for us. Instead the best way we can see to get a filming spot would be to fix the shed and we hoped that would be economical. The quotes came in a little higher than expected, but still at least we could sustain it as it is cheaper than renting year after year.
 
The Costs: 
 *Please Note: Costs shown are in Australian Dollars (AUD), however the total has been converted to USD for the campaign goal, as most of our audience reside in the US.
Shed Repairs: drainage, roof, rotted wood, internal plastering $15,583.00
Tin walls replaced with cladding: $8,337.00
Electricity repairs to make safe: $1,500.00
Toilet installation estimate: $1,900.00
Flooring- vinyl planks: $1,650.00
Campaign Fee's (IndieGoGo + Paypal and credit card fees) 10%:  $2,897.00 
TOTAL $31,867 AUD

</div></div>","OMG PROJECT SUMMARY
VICTORIA VESNA has been commissioned to be one of the keynote artists for this year’s Glow Art event in Santa Monica, California, which takes place on 28 September 2013. Together with her wonderful team, she is developing the Octopus Mandala Glow project for the famous Pacific Wheel— the only solar-powered wheel in the world!






""This work is particularly important for me as it has the potential of connecting public art, social networks and ready-made aesthetics in significant ways. OMG is a celebration of the end of the dominion of the machine, which invites people to occupy their ferris wheels around the world and record themselves at the top of the wheel chanting OM. The recorded voices will comprise a global chorus.
This collective chorus of voices will be played on the beach and streamed online. OMG in Santa Monica is only the premiere project with a goal of launching a series of projects with ferris wheels as mandalas around the world.

OMG is an attempt to create a collective mandala utilizing the ferris wheel.  It a ready made machine inspired in part by Duchamp’s bicycle wheel, and part by the Octopus and the NanoMandala project that I worked on together with a nanoscientist and tibetan monks. That sand mandala (chakrasamvara) created by the tibetan monks was thrown back into the ocean at the same Santa Monica beach!
The magic number of this project is eight— 8 spokes of a buddhist wheel, 8-bit LED system of the Pacific Wheel, octogonal gondolas, 8 legs of the octopus, and 8 of us in the core team.""YOUR HELP will not only make this global project possible, but will also have you directly participating in the launch of an idea into fruition. You will be helping us create a worldwide interactive experience, complete with handmade ceremonial objects, and an artist book documenting the process.


 GLOW art event in Santa Monica, California on 28 September 2013 will attract about 200,000 people on site, and many more online. People are invited to participate with their videos/voices from wheels they occupy solo or in groups all over the world!
➤ FOR MORE INFO, VISIT HTTP://OCTOPUSMANDALA.COM
 WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
The keynote artist commission is already half spent in developing the prototypes, graphic designs, testing lighting sequences and launching the website. The team that came together is incredibly talented and they have been working for minimum funds and maximum enthusiasm. Your help will make this unique public art event happen in a most magnificent way— extending out to the online community, creating octopus ceremonial suits and hats that are works of art projecting onto the ocean! 


This project has been in development since September 2012, and the inspiring process has been well documented. Extensive research has been made about the history of ferris wheels in parallel to discovering more and more about mandalas in buddhism and western mysticism, along with the amazing scientific findings about the octopus from evolutionary biologists and neuroscientists.
Your contributions will not only help us achieve a spectacular event— you will also receive a token of our appreciation, which in turn will give you a glimpse into the depths of OMG, or even give you a once in a lifetime chance to be an integral part of the performance event! The Artist's Notebook (one of the premiums we are offering), now in development, will provide our benefactors with a glimpse into the technological aspects of the interactive works we are creating, sharing every detail of what is involved in our process.


We may have enough to do the bare minimum, but ONLY YOU can make these happen:
• Sponsor Tibetan Monks to chant on the wheel.
• Sponsor other artists to participate from remote wheels around the globe.
• Develop an app for Iphone and Android.
• Design and print an artist book that describes the process and shares research on the mandalas, octopuses and other art / science aspects of this piece.
• Rent a high resolution projector for the event and project people inside the wheel onto the ocean.
• Buy audio equipment to record and distribute the voices around the beach during the event (to be uploaded to the website thereafter).
• Buy wireless equipment for the gondolas to communicate with the people on the wheel and stream live on the web.
• Design, silk-screen, print and distribute the t-shirts and posters.
• Give honorarium to the team that is working for minimal funds and maximum enthusiasm.
 



THE IMPACT
Public Art Events such as Octopus Mandala Glow (OMG) are a way of sharing and celebrating our humanity, building a global community and having fun and experiencing joy together.
The GLOW Festival is a public art event and OMG is one of the featured exhibits. We hope to use OMG as a prototype of a fun public art event and we are making plans to utilize Ferris Wheels all over the planet as a cohesive and symbolic theme of celebrating of the end of the dominion of the machine.

<h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
<p>We are <a href=""http://spicyzine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>SPICY</i></a>: a creative collective led by women of color and queer/trans people of color working at the intersection of art, activism, and publishing. Launched in February 2018, we've published over 60 articles, held over a dozen events, and most importantly we’ve disrupted the white-dominated media landscape.</p>
<p>We’re approaching our one-year anniversary, and we’re currently in the process of creating our first print zine. It will include essays, op-eds, and art that deconstructs the colonialist ideals that we've been taught. We hope that this project will confront what it means to “<i>unlearn</i>,” and prepare us for the possibility of “<i>reimagining</i>”.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHY DO WE NEED FUNDING?</h3>
<p>Everything that we do is a labor of love. We’re entirely self-funded, and many of our events and publishing costs come out of our own pockets. The money we raise will help us print our first zine (and future ones!), plan upcoming events, and maintain the platform we've built for our community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT IS OUR IMPACT?</h3>
<p>In the past year, our work has transformed into an entire community-based effort. We would be nothing without all the relationships we've built with like-minded creatives, and we want to continue providing a platform for people to connect, grow, and learn from each other.</p>
<p>We've provided an online platform for WoC and QTPoC to connect, share, and publish their work. We believe in healing through storytelling - and holding space for that transformative work, and those moments of growth and reflection, are the reason why we continue doing what we do.</p>
<p>We also believe that it's important to hold spaces in real life for our community to have fun, while making sure our events are all safe and inclusive environments (#POCTOTHEFRONT). We hosted panels, an open mic, a clothing swap, and a bunch of parties in 2018, and this year we want to do even more. With your help, we can.</p>

<h3>WHAT IF WE DON'T RECEIVE FUNDING?</h3>

<li>Create the IRL experiences our community deserves. This year we held open mics, panels, parties, markets, clothing swaps and more - but this year we want to do EVEN MORE.</li>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Caravan. We are a collective of artists, designers and architects aiming to set up a new and exciting travelling gallery, based in Edinburgh, Scotland. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We want to take innovative art, design and architecture to every corner of Scotland, England, Ireland, Wales and beyond! We also want to establish world-wide connections and tour the best possible art and design work.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The caravan needs a new refit and respray to turn it into a new lovely gallery, that's where you can really help...<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Caravan will enable the founding members to live out their dream and create jobs and opportunities for artists and designers all over Scotland, and - to be perfectly honest - live much happier lives. The money raised will go towards making a sustainable gallery and working space for some of the best creative talent Britain has to offer. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>All the money we raise via IndieGoGo - whether or not we reach the target - will go towards refitting and respraying the caravan. We have all put money into the pot, but it is just not enough as a full respray will cost a considerable amount. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>To thank all the kind people who donate to our worthy cause, we have worked out what we think is a very appealing list of perks. Taken from English money slang, we have created five levels of amazing perks and presents! We hope you find them enticing!</div>

<h3>2000 Pounds of Iron</h3>
<p>In July of 2007 I started my first small print shop in Walla Walla, WA. I had 110 square feet, a Kelsey Excelsior 5x8 tabletop press, and ten cases of type. Since then, my collection has grown and my needs have expanded. I acquired a C&amp;P 14x22, a double type cabinet, and 24 cases of type from a closing print shop and began plans to expand my business.</p>
<p>All this went on hold while I attended graduate school from 2009-2011, but now I'm out of school and ready to start printing again. Currently, my equipment is stored in Walla Walla, waiting to be brought out and used. I'm looking to move it to Seattle and open my press. I'm still working on the press name, so feel free to make suggestions. I'll release some as updates as the campaign progresses.</p>
<p>In March of this year I teamed up with another printer to begin looking for space. On March 30th, we found it! We're getting ready to sign a lease on 450 square feet in the ""Center of the Universe"" the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle.</p>
<p>My long term goal is to print a line of greeting cards; work with local poets, authors, and illustrators on fine press books; create custom stationary; and do small runs of custom lables for the many wineries and breweries in the state.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now I'm looking to raise $2200 to cover moving expenses (hauling a cast iron press across the mountains isn't cheap), a Boxcar Base for printing from plates (<a href=""http://www.boxcarpress.com/boxcar-base/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.boxcarpress.com/boxcar-base/index.html</a>), paper, and to offset the cost of rent while I work on getting clients. More specifically:</p>
<p>$300 for moving expenses</p>
<p>$300 for the Boxcar Base (with shipping)</p>
<p>$150 for paper</p>
<p>$300 for new rollers</p>
<p>$300 to put windows in the door</p>
<p><span>The balance will help with setting up the space, putting in an extra light and shelving, and general expenses. Anything over the goal will go towards ongoing operating expenses and supplies and will be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p>What you'll get:</p>
<p>$5 - A personal thank you email and a shout out on Twitter</p>
<p>$10 - Specially designed letterpress printed thank you card or calendar card</p>
<p>$25 -Thank you card and letterpress printed calendar card or five pack of greeting cards</p>
<p>$25 - Thank you card, calendar card, and five pack of greeting cards</p>
<p>$75 - Thank you card, calendar card, and hand bound paperback journal</p>
<p>$100 - The $75 level plus a five-pack of greeting cards</p>
<p>$200 - All of the above plus 20% off of up to $200 of custom work, stationary, or journals</p>

The exhibit, A Slight Suggestion, is presented by Catalyst Projects and will open April 12.It's a multimedia show featuring works that are inspired by my encounters with the world of shadows that surround us, a world that we often miss. Shadows of tree leaves on sunny, windy days animating sidewalks, and ordinary objects casting intricate silhouettes on various surfaces are all part of a lively theatre that’s constantly appearing and disappearing around us. This fleeting world is sometimes as wild as the wildest dancing, more poignant and arresting than sunsets and poetry--and it is all hidden in plain view.I'm asking for your contribution to help cover some of the costs involved with this project, which will include photo printing and mounting, the porcelain and electronic components required for making the illuminated-porcelain sculptures and other materials for the site-specific installations. I hope you can contribute. Thank you!Steve",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Contexte</h3>
<p>Le contexte politique et économique auquel fait actuellement face la Ville de Montréal n’est pas des plus reluisants: allégations de corruption, exode des familles en banlieue, pertes d’emplois majeures sur l’île, infrastructures de transport déficientes… pour ne nommer que ces exemples. Les critiques envers la métropole fusent de toutes parts, générant malheureusement un climat cynique récurrent dans notre quotidien. Mais le tableau est-il aussi sombre dans toutes les sphères d’activités de notre ville? Ne soyons pas si pessimistes.</p>
<p>Un exemple positif et concret est celui du design urbain de Montréal qui est en pleine effervescence depuis l’obtention du titre « Ville Unesco de design » en 2006. Montréal n’est peut-être pas encore une capitale mondiale de l’architecture, certes, mais on ne peut négliger les efforts consentis ces dernières années pour améliorer le sort de la métropole. Certains observateurs préfèrent voir le verre à moitié vide et critiquer le manque de vision de nos élus; personnellement, je perçois un verre à moitié plein qui ne demande qu’à être rempli. Les bons coups se multiplient sans cesse et doivent servir d’exemple pour le Montréal du futur.</p>
<p>C’est pourquoi ma carrière en journalisme a pris un tournant majeur en 2012 en me spécialisant en design urbain et en architecture. Que ce soit sur les ondes de CIBL, de la Première Chaîne de Radio-Canada ou encore à l’écrit dans le Journal Métro, l’architecture de qualité et le design urbain responsable restent au cœur de mes priorités.</p>
<p>Très peu de mes collègues couvrent actuellement ces secteurs d’activités, alors que le visage de Montréal évoluera rapidement ces prochaines années avec des chantiers majeurs comme l’échangeur Turcot, le nouveau pont Champlain, ou encore, le redéveloppement de quartier comme celui de Griffintown.

<h3>Mon projet</h3>
<p>Comment puis-je donc pousser encore plus loin mes efforts pour améliorer notre paysage urbain? En allant couvrir la prochaine édition du World Architecture Festival cet automne à Singapour. </p>
<p>L’événement accueillera de nombreux architectes-conférenciers du monde entier qui viendront partager leur vision et leur expertise sur diverses thématiques : la valeur économique et culturelle de l’architecture, le design urbain responsable, le rôle des architectes face aux changements climatiques, la densification des milieux urbains… Des thématiques qui nous touchent directement en sol québécois.</p>
<p>Mon but? Aller recueillir de nouvelles idées pour inspirer, voire influencer, notre développement urbain en les partageant via les tribunes médiatiques qui me sont offertes sur une base hebdomadaire. Cette expérience unique au World Architecture Festival me permettrait également d’aller peaufiner mes acquis en assistant aux nombreuses conférences sur le site, et m’offrirait du même coup une chance inespérée de me bâtir un réseau de contacts international.</p>
<p>L’architecture et le design urbain ont tant d’impacts sur notre économie, la santé publique, le tourisme et notre qualité de vie qu’on doit y développer une plus grande sensibilité ces prochaines années. </p>

is a program in which up to 15 participants will engage in <b>hands-on ceramic
arts experiences</b> over six months with local artist mentors and Gallery arts
educators. With your help we will provide a special opportunity for a group of
teens, who <span style="""">might not normally have
access to such an in-depth creative arts program</span>. The participants <span style="""">will be identified and nominated by
community health, education and social service organizations.<i> </i></span>art4teens
will empower these teens. The experience will allow for free expression of
ideas through their art with fellow participants and ultimately with the
community. Through the accessible arts programming and resources we will help
create a positive path as our teens move forward in their lives.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 14.0pt;"">art4teens will be celebrated with a public exhibition at the Gallery that invites the community to meet the artists and see their creative expressions.

express them. Please join us in support of art4teens. <b>Every dollar helps to

</div></div>","What is art4teens?

 

art4teens
is a program in which up to 15 participants will engage in hands-on ceramic
arts experiences over six months with local artist mentors and Gallery arts
educators. With your help we will provide a special opportunity for a group of
teens, who might not normally have
access to such an in-depth creative arts program. The participants will be identified and nominated by
community health, education and social service organizations. art4teens
will empower these teens. The experience will allow for free expression of
ideas through their art with fellow participants and ultimately with the
community. Through the accessible arts programming and resources we will help
create a positive path as our teens move forward in their lives.
art4teens will be celebrated with a public exhibition at the Gallery that invites the community to meet the artists and see their creative expressions. We can all learn from the teen artists and conversations about their ideas and their art will stimulate and inspire attendees and participants alike.
Why We Need YOUR Help

It is so easy for teens to think that their community
doesn’t care for them…they often feel they are alone and detached. Our staff and
Gallery supporters believe art4teens sends a strong message that we do care
about their feelings, about who they are, about their thoughts and the means to
express them. Please join us in support of art4teens. Every dollar helps to
support this worthwhile program. Why not get your business, club, class or team
together and make a group donation! The project is a way for all of us to give
back to the community and show that we believe in young people.
    
""We must provide access to creative outlets for teens...offer hands-on experiences that allow ideas and emotions to come out in something physical ""
Murray Gamble, community leader and arts advocate




Be A Part Of art4teens And See The Impact On Teen Participants Who Will:

Develop pride within themselves and within their communities through public display of their work.
Build confidence through engaging in activities where they can express their identity.
Develop communication skills by sharing ideas with others.
Grow skills and team work by working with others and by participating in arts activities that require cooperation, collaboration and team work.
Develop an understanding of new ceramic processes by working long term with local professional artists





Expression is the key takeaway from this program. By supporting art4teens you are giving the participants a chance to develop skills that will be carried through their everyday lives. Not only will you make a difference now, but also for their future.

Any funds that are received from this campaign will go directly to art4teens and the further development of this community program. We will issue tax receipts for the maximum allowable amount.


About Our Artist Mentors
The Clay & Glass is an ideal environment for such a program as we have the expertise in-house through our accomplished staff: Nadine Badran, Manager of Public Programs and Sheila McMath, Curator. We also have selected three artist mentors: Natalie Prevost-Mero, Chris Hierlihy, Jaclyn Ryan. They are prepared to mentor and teach the teens within their respective areas of expertise (wheel work, hand building, image transfer and glazing). They are especially receptive to the ideas and needs of participants and are sensitive to the specific challenges faced by teens.

The Clay & Glass... A Creative SpaceAs a contemporary art gallery we host dynamic exhibitions
featuring the work of Canadian and international artists with a focus on ceramic,
glass and enamel art works. We attract over 4,000 youth through our programs
that include Play with Clay, camps, after-school programs, and school field
trips. We also offer customized programs for youth at risk and those with
special needs.The Gallery itself is a stunning open architectural space. It houses many outstanding artworks that will inspire the teens. Through viewing other accomplished artists' works and meeting many arts practitioners they will grow their knowledge of ceramics and contemporary art. That could be a springboard to further study and this bodes well for the long-term emotional and social growth of the teen participants who, with your help, will become more active, productive, creative, arts-conscious and engaged community members.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, we need to fill this wall with eye-popping color that will make The Lake Park Arts District visible from outer space! Okay, maybe that's a bit unrealistic, but we still want to beautify this town with public art. The extent to which the wall gets painted depends on how much money we raise.</p>
<p>100% of all the funds raised will be going towards supplies, rental equipment, permitting and actually paying these artists because artwork is WORK. Once we reach our initial goal any additional money raised will be put into escrow and applied to the next round of muralists until we are able to paint the entire 700 building (pretty much a city block) every six months. After that, we start again right back at the beginning so there is always fresh imagery to inspire our community.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481483126/v7z6ztz7ww4b9igckcjx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are also partnering with local businesses, art stores, construction companies, and the suppliers themselves in order to minimize the amount of money we have to actually spend to make this wall happen. In turn, we are able to put more money into the artist pockets allowing them to continue to share their work and make a living.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481483151/ymabsojvevezf0vbwqhz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

He creates art, for him, with hopes that it will stir something in the viewer…there is no other reason.

</div></div>","Introducing Kelsey Cares. After multiple community projects to revitalize the Town of Lake Park through the arts, specifically our renowned mural projects, we are now furthering our efforts through receiving our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status. Founded in 1919, the original Kelsey City (now Lake Park) was a cultural hub and we are continuing Harry Kelsey's vision by cultivating The Lake Park Arts District. Kelsey Cares is Funding art, theater, music, film, and cultural development through community outreach by providing subsidies for productions, events, artists and musicians to carry out their mission.

 
The Back Alley Mural Project  
Thanks to the local community the launch of The Kelsey Theater has been a growing success, and even given birth to what we now call The Lake Park Arts District. That left us wondering, ""What else can we do to make Lake Park great?"" The answer is to utilize the only real estate we have left in a project that benefits local artists and the community alike.
Where others saw only a blank wall A.J. Brockman and company saw a blank canvas with seemingly endless opportunities. The plan is to turn the back side of the 700 block into a giant mural with contributions from multiple artists. Much like Miami's Wynwood we are taking an otherwise unremarkable alleyway and turning it into a cultural destination. 

So why are we raising money? All of the artists involved are professionals, people who make their living from their art. Many times people get artists to do something like this in exchange for ""exposure"" and as artists ourselves we feel that is not always fair. They deserve compensation for their contribution. So the money raised will first purchase the materials needed and then every remaining cent will go to paying the artists for their work. 
Won't you join us and make Lake Park beautiful again?

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">On the 15th of February 2013, a 4.5-billion-year-old relic of the solar system unexpectedly pierced Earth’s atmosphere and began its fiery descent toward the surface. It exploded 15 seconds later in a half-megaton explosion. The meteorite was named Chelyabinsk and it is recognized as one of the century's most historical meteorite impact. </span></p></figure>
<p>We are a team of designers from Bath UK, who after seeing the fireball's descent to Earth and learning about the incredible journey of the Chelyabinsk Meteorite, were inspired to share this rare artifact with the world. We wanted a piece of the Chelyabinsk Meteorite to be shared with everyone, and thus, the concept of INFINITY - The Pen From Space was born. </p>

<p>We set ourselves the challenge of designing a unique Pen centered around showcasing the Meteorite while delivering an exceptionally high-quality writing experience yet at an affordable price. </p>
<p>After solving the problem of how we would process the Meteorite to the correct form and then combine it in a water clear encapsulation, we went on to review as many Pen body designs, nibs and refills that we could source and finally selected an established,  beautiful, classic, well balanced pen body design, that is compatible with the world's best German engineered nibs and refills, in order to combine an iconic look and feel with a high-quality, contemporary, smooth and consistent writing experience.</p>

<p>Moving in excess of 12 miles per second (faster than Mach 60), 62 miles above the glaciated plains of the Russia–Kazakhstan border, a 4.5-billion-year-old relic of the solar system punctured the Earth’s atmosphere and began its fiery descent over the snow-covered Kurgan and Chelyabinsk Oblasts. It was tailed by a pair of smoky, iridescent plumes, and constantly shed debris before abruptly decelerating and exploding in a final half-megaton explosion. The whole explosive journey took just over 15 seconds after over 4 billion years tumbling silently through space. </p>
<p>The explosion left behind a group of rocky remnants that headed west, passing 25 miles from Chelyabinsk city center. The largest landed 18 miles farther in Lake Chebarkul at the foot of the Ural Mountains, creating a 6-meter wide hole in its ice. The event was the most dramatic near-Earth asteroid airburst since the 1908 Tunguska impact blast in Siberia. It is a unique meteor event in being recorded in such vivid detail.  </p>

<p>Meteorites are some of the oldest, rarest and most remarkable objects on our planet. They carry within them messages and materials that have traveled enormous distances from the depths of space and they’re truly some of the most enchanting things we’ll ever get to experience.</p>
<p>After seeing the incredible footage of the Chelyabinsk meteorite entering the earth’s atmosphere, we wanted to ensure that everyone had the opportunity to hold this rare and amazing piece of the universe in the palm of their hand.</p>

It exploded 15 seconds later in a half-megaton explosion. The meteorite was named Chelyabinsk and it is recognized as one of the century's most historical meteorite impact. 
We are a team of designers from Bath UK, who after seeing the fireball's descent to Earth and learning about the incredible journey of the Chelyabinsk Meteorite, were inspired to share this rare artifact with the world. We wanted a piece of the Chelyabinsk Meteorite to be shared with everyone, and thus, the concept of INFINITY - The Pen From Space was born. 


We set ourselves the challenge of designing a unique Pen centered around showcasing the Meteorite while delivering an exceptionally high-quality writing experience yet at an affordable price. 
After solving the problem of how we would process the Meteorite to the correct form and then combine it in a water clear encapsulation, we went on to review as many Pen body designs, nibs and refills that we could source and finally selected an established,  beautiful, classic, well balanced pen body design, that is compatible with the world's best German engineered nibs and refills, in order to combine an iconic look and feel with a high-quality, contemporary, smooth and consistent writing experience.


INFINITY has been designed in limited numbers and comes as either a Fountain Pen, Rollerball, or Ballpoint Pen. All three have been perfectly weighted and contrast a dark matter resin with a polished metal finish, to produce an exceptional everyday pen.


The Infinity - Ballpoint, Rollerball and Fountain Pen



Moving in excess of 12 miles per second (faster than Mach 60), 62 miles above the glaciated plains of the Russia–Kazakhstan border, a 4.5-billion-year-old relic of the solar system punctured the Earth’s atmosphere and began its fiery descent over the snow-covered Kurgan and Chelyabinsk Oblasts. It was tailed by a pair of smoky, iridescent plumes, and constantly shed debris before abruptly decelerating and exploding in a final half-megaton explosion. The whole explosive journey took just over 15 seconds after over 4 billion years tumbling silently through space. 
The explosion left behind a group of rocky remnants that headed west, passing 25 miles from Chelyabinsk city center. The largest landed 18 miles farther in Lake Chebarkul at the foot of the Ural Mountains, creating a 6-meter wide hole in its ice. The event was the most dramatic near-Earth asteroid airburst since the 1908 Tunguska impact blast in Siberia. It is a unique meteor event in being recorded in such vivid detail.  

Meteor Landing Site - Lake Chebarkul
It took Russian scientists 5 months to identify the meteorite buried in mud in the depths of the lake. An operation to recover the meteorite began in September 2013 and concluded with the raising of a fragment with an estimated mass of 654 kg.

Meteorites are some of the oldest, rarest and most remarkable objects on our planet. They carry within them messages and materials that have traveled enormous distances from the depths of space and they’re truly some of the most enchanting things we’ll ever get to experience.
After seeing the incredible footage of the Chelyabinsk meteorite entering the earth’s atmosphere, we wanted to ensure that everyone had the opportunity to hold this rare and amazing piece of the universe in the palm of their hand.
Our goal was to combine this historic artifact that had traveled across the Universe from the beginning of time, with something that you could use every day, and thus INFINITY - The Pen From Space was born.

I’ve worked hard on my dream of earning a living from my wood/art work. Working with wood grounds me and fills me with more positive rewards than any job I have done. It’s great to see people’s reactions when they see what can be made from so called waste wood. I Started again with my wood art last year after a challenging split from a long term relationship. I know that getting robbed won’t stop me from achieving my goals, but It has set me back financially. If I can get some help from you good people, even for just some of the essential tools, it will enable me to get straight back to working on my art so I can pay my way. That will be a blessing and a great help towards my target of working with wood full time.</p><p><strong>A brief history of Wayne!</strong></p><p>My passion for working with wood started around 2001 when I went to a green fair near my home town in Lancashire. There was a saw miller and a chainsaw carver making benches, bird boxes, Viking chairs all from one/two inch thick boards cut straight off the mill there and then. I got chatting to them. They were under staffed and within an hour I was selling the finished pieces for them to the public. It went so well they asked me to come back the following day. By the end of the weekend I’d sold their entire stock! We got on so well that they offered me a job. I worked as groundsman for a year and then ended up managing their yard. A favourite role at the yard was working with the miller cutting the wood to spec and selling the milled wood to carvers, joiners, cabinet makers, turners - craftsmen of all sorts. I learnt a lot from the older crafts men who regularly visited the yard. One day I was out on a big job - a copper beech whose roots were sadly badly damaged. I noticed straight away that its branches had a multitude of curves, shapes and letters running everywhere and I was really drawn to that. I couldn’t bring myself to feed such beautiful shapes and fusions into the chipper, so I worked a little harder to keep up with the climbers and saved a lot of the branches. I could see archways, L shaped sections, snake like branches and lots of ‘natural fusions’. I decided I could make a natural shaped chair out of all these bits. With a little help from my friend I made my first chair out of the branches and from that moment on I was hooked. Since then I have been salvaging odd shaped branches, stems, root balls, ancient bog oak, hollows, punky, burr and spalted wood. I source from anywhere there is what most people would call waste wood. I look beyond the mud, lumps of fungi and rot and see the natural shapes, usually hidden in the piece.  It could be a chair, sculpture, coffee table, display unit, bed board, bowl – almost anything really. That’s the beauty of wood, if you know what to look for, there is every conceivable shape imaginable! I love seeking it out, saving it from being wasted, and working it to reveal its natural beauty.</p><p><strong>Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Any assistance what so ever is greatly appreciated, I am so thankful for your contributions - even the smallest of donations will help.

It’s great to see people’s reactions when they see what can be made from so called waste wood. I Started again with my wood art last year after a challenging split from a long term relationship. I know that getting robbed won’t stop me from achieving my goals, but It has set me back financially. If I can get some help from you good people, even for just some of the essential tools, it will enable me to get straight back to working on my art so I can pay my way. That will be a blessing and a great help towards my target of working with wood full time.A brief history of Wayne!My passion for working with wood started around 2001 when I went to a green fair near my home town in Lancashire. There was a saw miller and a chainsaw carver making benches, bird boxes, Viking chairs all from one/two inch thick boards cut straight off the mill there and then. I got chatting to them. They were under staffed and within an hour I was selling the finished pieces for them to the public. It went so well they asked me to come back the following day. By the end of the weekend I’d sold their entire stock! We got on so well that they offered me a job. I worked as groundsman for a year and then ended up managing their yard. A favourite role at the yard was working with the miller cutting the wood to spec and selling the milled wood to carvers, joiners, cabinet makers, turners - craftsmen of all sorts. I learnt a lot from the older crafts men who regularly visited the yard. One day I was out on a big job - a copper beech whose roots were sadly badly damaged. I noticed straight away that its branches had a multitude of curves, shapes and letters running everywhere and I was really drawn to that. I couldn’t bring myself to feed such beautiful shapes and fusions into the chipper, so I worked a little harder to keep up with the climbers and saved a lot of the branches. I could see archways, L shaped sections, snake like branches and lots of ‘natural fusions’. I decided I could make a natural shaped chair out of all these bits. With a little help from my friend I made my first chair out of the branches and from that moment on I was hooked. Since then I have been salvaging odd shaped branches, stems, root balls, ancient bog oak, hollows, punky, burr and spalted wood. I source from anywhere there is what most people would call waste wood. I look beyond the mud, lumps of fungi and rot and see the natural shapes, usually hidden in the piece.  It could be a chair, sculpture, coffee table, display unit, bed board, bowl – almost anything really. That’s the beauty of wood, if you know what to look for, there is every conceivable shape imaginable! I love seeking it out, saving it from being wasted, and working it to reveal its natural beauty.Ways You Can HelpAny assistance what so ever is greatly appreciated, I am so thankful for your contributions - even the smallest of donations will help. And if you can’t support me financially, you can still help by sharing this campaign with your friends and family and spreading the word.Your willingness to share this project and ask for support on my behalf is of incredible value to me and I thank you for that! Love and lightWayneFor those who are interested, here's a breakdown of all the equipment stolen, so you know exactly where any donations you make will end up.

It’s important to note that for every major move in my life art and art making has always been a strong motivating factor.

Ever wondered what an artist residency abroad looks like? Want to see what I'm doing when I'm doing it? Curious about Slovenia? I'll be off all social media sites while working at D'Clinic Studios -- with the exception of these weekly emails. Starting one week before I leave and ending one week after I return, this perk will give you an exclusive look at what an artist residency can look like, how my work output will take shape, and all the Slovenian factoids I can fit in! Plus, lots of pictures!</p><p>For a little more money, I also suggest the ""Artist's Book."" As part of my residency at D'Clinic Studios I will be completing a published Artist's Book.

of this could have happened without all the support I've gotten from 
everyone. Literally every dollar counted towards my goal, no amount of 
support was too small.<br/><br/>Having said that: there are still perks to be had for your walls and bookshelves! Please consider 
sharing this campaign via your social networks to get the word out. <br/><br/>For
 complete transparency: money that is received above and beyond my 
initial amount will go directly towards travel and art supply costs 
while in Slovenia as well as transportation of my finished work back to 
the States. This IS NOT going towards things like paying my rent or 
utilities in Philadelphia.<br/><br/>Again, thank you so much for 
everyone's support. Initially I felt a mixture of emotions when deciding
 if I should do this or not -- mostly embarrassment -- but the kind 
words and financial support I have received have been truly inspiring.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Thank YOU!<br/>

The $1700 I'm asking for will cover a roundtrip ticket.Perks:I'm offering a variety of pieces that I have completed over the last two years. I highly suggest the ""Exclusive Update Emails."" Ever wondered what an artist residency abroad looks like? Want to see what I'm doing when I'm doing it? Curious about Slovenia? I'll be off all social media sites while working at D'Clinic Studios -- with the exception of these weekly emails. Starting one week before I leave and ending one week after I return, this perk will give you an exclusive look at what an artist residency can look like, how my work output will take shape, and all the Slovenian factoids I can fit in! Plus, lots of pictures!For a little more money, I also suggest the ""Artist's Book."" As part of my residency at D'Clinic Studios I will be completing a published Artist's Book. This will be a unique look at my time and work output while in Slovenia. I will be receiving 20 copies, 15 of which I offer to you!International supporters: Please consider donating extra to help offset shipping costs! **UPDATES** With 62 hours left in my campaign, 111% was hit!Absolutely none 
of this could have happened without all the support I've gotten from 
everyone. Literally every dollar counted towards my goal, no amount of 
support was too small.Having said that: there are still perks to be had for your walls and bookshelves! Please consider 
sharing this campaign via your social networks to get the word out. For
 complete transparency: money that is received above and beyond my 
initial amount will go directly towards travel and art supply costs 
while in Slovenia as well as transportation of my finished work back to 
the States. This IS NOT going towards things like paying my rent or 
utilities in Philadelphia.Again, thank you so much for 
everyone's support. Initially I felt a mixture of emotions when deciding
 if I should do this or not -- mostly embarrassment -- but the kind 
words and financial support I have received have been truly inspiring.Thank YOU!
