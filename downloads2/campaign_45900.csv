I realized at a young age that I wanted to create. After high school I decided to go to college for Graphic Design, but soon after concluded that my heart wasn’t in it. My dreams of being a designer were stifled only by the feeling that I might not have what it took. When my nails started to turn heads everywhere I went, I realized it was time to go for it. What did I have to lose? I started designing my own nails because I couldn’t find salons that were able to do what I wanted done. It is not exactly how I thought I would get started, I just kind of fell into it, but I am passionate about it. Nails, for me, had become my most important accessory when putting an outfit together. We ALL know how important accessories are. With that in mind I decided to acquire my certification in Nail Technology, and to develop my own line of hand painted nails. After premiering my first couple nail collections, I expanded my line to offer other handmade accessories.</p>

</div></div>","They say words have power and here at UpLyft Wear we not only agree with that, but we allow you to put your ""Power Words"" right on the front of your custom designed shirt for the world to see.
Your favorite new shirt has a mission. Here at UpLyft Wear every shirt we make, and you help design, has a very special mission. To help you be a better you. To help you see the powerful you that sometimes gets lost in the day to day hustle and bustle of the world. Your favorite new shirt lets you show the world exactly what you stand for in no uncertain terms. 
What is your Power Word? It's that word that resonates all the way to the center of your being. We all have them, and some of you have a few of them and each one states exactly who you are and how you are committed to changing the world. 
On our website you will be able to design your own shirt. You choose your ""Power Word"" that will be printed on one side and a design of your choice for the other side. Each shirt is custom designed by you and individually printed by UpLyft Wear. At present there are 20 designs and over 50 words. Have a word that isn't on our list. You will be able to submit it and if our team agrees that it is uplifting we will be happy to print it for you with your chosen design.Oh, and it's a top quality shirt made to last you for years because that's the way we believe things should be done. We will be adding additional shirt styles and designs as we grow so you can create a collection of ""Power Word"" shirts if you want.
Here at UpLyft Wear we are not just making clothing we are on a mission. We are on a mission to help change the world. And we will do it one shirt at a time by helping our clients share what they stand for with the world. By helping each and every client stand up and start a conversation with the world without even having to say a word, if they don't choose to. To shout out loud this is who I am and this is what I stand for while remaining silent. And we invite you to be part of this change. To be part of a world that is changing for the better.
We knew that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stood for EQUALITY.We knew that John F. Kennedy stood for CHANGE.We knew that Steve Jobs stood for INNOVATION.They were on big stages and lived their lives showing what they stood for. What drove them. Not all of us live in that type of environment but each and every one of us can inspire change. Each and every one of us can stand up for what we believe in. We can stand up and show the world what drives us and how we are changing the world in our own way.We all know people that live their deepest truths on a day by day basis. The teacher who must EDUCATE, the scientist who must DISCOVER, the gardener who must NURTURE, The entrepreneur who must CREATE , the medical professional who must HEAL. Many people build their careers around their power words, others their hobbies and lifestyles. But we all know when we are doing the things that let us share our souls. That is when we are truly living. What do you stand for? Compassion? Wisdom? Freedom? Connection? Expression? Leadership? 
What gift do you already share?We want you to share your gifts and help us change the world....one shirt at a time. And that will inspire one action at a time...and that is our way of helping to change this planet for the better.""Be the change you want to see in the world"" - Mahatma Gandhi.
Why do we need your help?
Although we have created samples and initial designs we now need to get products out there being worn and seen. We have manufacturing companies ready to go for initial production orders. We need to get samples to our marketing partners. We need to have our website completed which will allow our clients to design and then order their shirts. And most of all we need people out there wearing our shirts and sharing both our concept and their personal message with the world.Our priority if we are only partially funded will be to get our website up and running and deliver all the promised premiums. We have a number of joint venture partners ready to start taking orders and spreading our message just as soon as our website is ready to take orders.Later we will be doing another fundIng to actually bring all manufacturing in house allowing us to maintain the highest quality standards on each and every shirt we ship for you to wear.Please look at the pledge options and even if you can't help financially help us by spreading the word through family, friends and social media and use the IndieGoGo share tools.Thanks,The UpLyft Team

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p><i>My name is Grace Cuffy. I am a 20 yr old aspiring Fashion Designer attending the Art Institute of Fashion Design. I am working toward graduation with my BA in March of 2012 but dreams dreams don't have due dates.The project i am working on is called the Annuaire de la Mode Fashion Show which pretty much means ""Fashion Yearbook"" in French. it's a </i><i>modern presentation of a </i><i>collection of the past decades. This Show is to present myself to the world as a designer with something to say. I want to change the way people look at fashion and make it accessible to everyone. I want to use the skills that I've learned to help people in the less fortunate Caribbean islands to have those same skills accessible right where they are. </i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>I want to begin a program where i can travel to different schools among the islands (and hopefully around the world) every summer, to give kids and young adults who have the dream of designing, the tools to make it happen from their own homes. I want to share what i was taught with them so that they in turn can keep it going and help others in their own way. </i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>In the fashion world what you see is what you get and in order to reach the necessary people i need to help me reach my goal i also need to get the necessary help to meet these people. With the donations i hope to receive from whoever is reading, i will be that much closer to being able to help those kids make their own dreams come true. So helping me in turn helps a lot more than initially intended. There's no better feeling than being a part of that.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>My ultimate goal is to create a household brand that will benefit everyone and not just one type of person. I want to create clothing that will make people excited to get dressed to go anywhere, and feel good about themselves all the time. They shouldn't have to worry about saving up multiple paychecks to do so one garment at a time. Someone who doesn't care for a large wardrobe will look just as put together as someone who cant keep the same clothes in their closet for longer than 3 months. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>I want a percentage of profit to go towards giving kids and young adults coming up, an opportunity to better their skills without having to leave home.

If i can get started with the right people,to eventually grow from design summits in high schools and colleges to actual facilities on different islands.In order to reach that goal i need readers to know that i'm here and i'm serious.

My ultimate goal is to create a household brand that will benefit everyone and not just one type of person. I want to create clothing that will make people excited to get dressed to go anywhere, and feel good about themselves all the time. They shouldn't have to worry about saving up multiple paychecks to do so one garment at a time.

Not only are you impacting women, but you are also impacting teens and young ladies by reminding them of their inner beauty, while providing them with a way to dress in a way that is in style and flattering.I believe this is an incredible way to just love ladies! Not only will they be able to fit in with current trends in fashion, but they will receive a message that goes far beyond 'physical' and encourages their character and idea of self-worth.Other Ways You Can HelpCan't contribute financially? We still need your help:
Help us advertise! Show other's this goal and encourage them to contribute and spread the word about Ruth Vintage
Use Indiegogo's share tools to share this campaign on social media
And of course, encouragement! Kind words are always appreciated.  
Help me make this dream and focus a reality. Do it for the ladies.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Speak, and CoWatch will listen. With a built in dynamic speaker - and as the first smartwatch to integrate Alexa, Amazon's cloud-based voice service, you can ask for a traffic report, control connected devices, make a phone call to a friend, order a taxi to your home, pay your bills, and so much more. As long as your CoWatch is connected to a WiFI network or to your phone with a data connection, Alexa will be on!

Your smart home is at your fingertips. The power of Bluetooth 4.1 and cloud connectivity lets you dim the lights, check on your car, turn up the heat, and interact with the devices, products, and services that matter to you most.



Friends encourage friends to stay healthy. Be proactive and let CoWatch sweat the small stuff. CoWatch can track your calories burned, count your steps, even monitor your heart rate after and during a workout. Using a nine-axis accelerometer, digital compass and gyroscope, as well as heart rate sensor and vibro motor, CoWatch can help you keep track of every move.


Maximize efficiency and connect with a simple touch. Send a quick response through text message, check your emails, review your calls on your phone, connect to your favourite streaming service, and turn on your favourite song - CoWatch can do it all.


CoWatch unites classic watch design with state of the art technology. Elegantly constructed and at a price point that competes with other luxury brands, you have a choice between carbon black or mineral silver stainless steel, with a fracture-resistant zirconia composite ceramic body for excellent wireless signal (2.4G 802.11 b/g/n). The vivid super AMOLED 400 x 400 high-resolution touch screen has an interchangeable and reactive watch face, catering to your mood, experience, and look, from day to night. 
Hand pick the watch face that matches your mood. Professional? Minimalist? Fun? We've created a variety of watch faces to choose from that anyone can enjoy. Switch on the fly and be  ready to pair with any ensemble or occasion.




The design of CoWatch's software and hardware architectures were carefully synchronized with Cronologics, a software platform built to deliver a precise next generation smartwatch experience. The essentials, and then some - app developers will also soon have an opportunity to get involved to build a unique experience on every CoWatch.

With a platform that competes in a class of its own, including an industry leading internal processing capability (1.2GHz), the cherry on top is the CoWatch is one of the first smart watches with 8GB of memory to guarantee unmatched performance.









With up to 32 hours of battery life in an always-on mode, CoWatch works as hard as you do - from dusk 'til dawn. Connect directly to the magnetic charging cradle and within one hour, you'll be guaranteed up to 70% battery capacity, working as fast and efficiently as your CoWatch.

</div></div>","'The Socks no.1513' is made from the ""Organic cotton"" produced by minimizing the chemical process and the ""Copper(CU)"", the only metal that can remove up to 99.9% of the bacteria in the fiber. 

 Our feet consist of 30 joints, 52 bones, and 19 muscles. And we walk an average of 5,000 steps a day and about 62,000 miles over our lifetime.
 As such, our feet have long been the center of our body rhythms, a so called ""second heart"", and we have a duty to make sure our feet are pleasant and clean.
 

 Copper(CU) ion of 'The Socks no.1513' destroys the cell structure of the microorganism and strongly suppresses the propagation of bacteria.
 'The Socks no.1513' excellent antimicrobial ability by inhibiting the frowth of gerems is basically blocked the odor from bacterial feces.

 
 

 

 In August 2010, a Chilean mine collapsed and 33 miners were trapped. The miners were all dramatically alive after 69 days, but what happened in the mine for about two months? The miners lived with the help of government and people, supplied for the food, medicines, etc. necessary for survival.

 However, due to the heat and the humid environment, their feet began to develop fungal diseases such as athlete's foot.Initially, they treated their feet with antifungal ointment. But when it was not possible to cure it, they replaced the treatment with the socks containing   ""copper"". They reported by the JAMA Network that after two weeks of wearing copper socks, nearly 90% of the cases had improved symptoms.


  ""Overall, their skin condition, especially on their feet…were extremely good despite 69 days of exposure to an environment that promoted the growth of skin-damaging microbes,"" the researchers wrote in their report.

<h3>Kathmandu, Nepal</h3>
<p>Nepal is famous for its mountains, topping the world at 8,850m at the summit of Everest. Yet everything else operates at a much lower level. Nepal is the second poorest country in Asia after Afghanistan, and a high percentage of its population is vulnerable to human exploitation.</p>

<p><strong>The Community</strong></p>
<p>Nepal is the second poorest country in Asia. That is not without a long list of reasons. The specter of its 10-year civil war that ended in 2006, the political instability that ensued, ongoing rampant corruption, difficult access to markets (exemplified by the 5-month blockade at its border with India earlier this year), make an environment that is barely conductive to business and investment.</p>
<p>And that is without considering the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake the country suffered on April 25th, 2015, that levelled almost half a million homes and affected 5.6 milion people.</p>
<p>It is no surprise then that 1 in 5 Nepalis have left the country to find work abroad, often in situations that make them extremely vulnerable to abuse, exploitation and bonded labour. For those that remain, opportunities are few and far between. The average worker makes less than $4/day and unemployment is above 40%. Human exploitation, including sex trafficking, exists within its borders and, while pervasive, especially affects lower castes, people living with disease, certain religious groups and women — who are often treated as second-class humans.</p>
<p>We were particularly disturbed to learn that Nepal is a major source of children subjected to sex trafficking. UNICEF estimates that 7,000 women and girls are trafficked to India alone every year. It is not uncommon for parents to regard “extra” children, particularly girls, as a liability. In some cases, parents sell their children. More commonly, parents or children are lured to “big city” opportunities that inevitably end under lock in brothels in cities like Kathmandu, Kolkata, Delhi or Mumbai.</p>

<h3>Jaipur, India</h3>
<p>Jaipur is the capital city of Rajasthan. Home to 6.6 milion people, it is a popular tourist destination with a strong tradition in textiles – above all, block printing.</p>

<p><strong>The Makers</strong></p>
<p>Shari Keller is an American who has found her second home in India. She holds a PhD in anthropology and, as Fulbright scholar, undertook research in the slums of Hyderabad for a year. In short, she has direct and extensive experience of the difficult reality of the destitute in the country she first visited in 1975.</p>
<p>It is very telling, therefore, that Shari has chosen to found a clothing social enterprise in Jaipur, as a way to make a living and contribute to the community. Entering Mehera Shaw’s facilities, the collegial atmosphere quickly denotes this company’s true socially conscious culture – a lingering feeling that goes over and above her Fairtrade certification hung on the office wall. In fact, the staff, hired regardless of caste and economic background, are Shari’s extended family.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476668189/o9rfieaz1fbbec4u1qus.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>The Community</strong></p>
<p>Jaipur, like the rest of India, is a difficult destination for any first-timer Westerner traveller. It is difficult to assimilate the misery of families living under bridges in cardboard boxes and seeing destitute children eat out of the garbage while life, overcrowded and drowned in the noise of seemingly chaotic traffic, goes on all around.</p>
<p>Rajasthan is home to a strong heritage in artisan industry such as jewelry and textiles. In the garment industry, it is particularly known for its traditional block printing. Carvers repeatedly hammer nails as chisels on a block of wood, slowly creating intricate patterns that can take up to two days of labour to complete. These are then charged with garment dye and carefully placed on extended fabrics to create Rajasthani traditionally artisan fabrics. The whole process is part of our human heritage to be preserved.</p>
<p>Growth, however, is in tourism. The Pink City of India is well-known to foreigners as it is home to the Amber Fort and Hawa Mahal among its many sights – all part of the golden triangle tourist routeI. Tourism provides opportunities to individuals and families from elsewhere in the Rajasthani region and is a big draw for internal migration – adults and children who upon arriving to Jaipur typically settle by under the bridges around the train station. There is a clear need to provide opportunities to disadvantaged individuals and families, regardless of background and caste.</p>

<h3>Tadó, Colombia</h3>
<p>Tadó is a small town in Chocó, Colombia’s poorest region in the Pacific rainforest. The National Liberation Army (ELN), a Marxist guerrilla, continues to wrestle with state forces in one of the last active areas of Colombia’s armed conflict.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/178960792?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>The Makers</strong></p>
<p>Beatriz is a good example of what is untrue in the usual poor and lazy stereotypical portrait of the people of Chocó. She is full of energy and strives to make things better around her. She is the director of La Platina, a dance group designed to keep the local folkloric heritage alive and, at the same time, offer a positive pastime to youth that would otherwise be in danger. For years, she has sewn the dance group’s costumes.</p>
<p>Astrid’s eyes light up when she tells the story of her first times behind her mother’s sewing machine as a child. She was not allowed to touch it, lest she break it. In hiding, she would use any opportunity to have a go at the machine. One time the needle went through her nail and, in fear of being found out, she did not utter a sound. That's passion.</p>
<p>Alexander is a professional tailor. He does not have children of his own but is proud to support his extended family. Not a small feat for a physically handicapped individual in this part of the world. And it is proof that sewing is, in his own words, “my destiny”.</p>
<p>Silvia’s story is the most touching. Raised by an aunt who did not want her niece to do better than her own children, Silvia was held back from school. She married, and the story repeated itself: the husband restricted her to the house in his need to fill in the shoes of breadwinner. Unable to cope with the role, the husband shot himself in the living room in front of their children. Silvia was left with no education, no skills and three children to care for, the youngest just a baby. With Beatriz’s support along with that of the community, she “empirically” learned the clothes-making trade and, not short of pain and strife, over the years she has been able to put food on the table, a roof over their heads and put her eldest through university. Her youngest is doing well in school at 15. It is not all rosy: her middle child is an alcoholic at 18. But her story is a tremendous inspiration to overcoming obstacles.</p>

<p><strong>The Community</strong></p>
<p>Tadó is a town of some 10,000 people nested in the thick of the Pacific rainforest and almost exclusively populated by black decedents of former slaves. Until recently, the lack of decent roads kept this town relatively isolated, which is evident in the apparent slow pace of life as people great each other incessantly. But the slow pace is also an ingrained consequence of the lack of jobs. There are no official figures, but we were told that maybe 35% of people have employment. The town traditionally made do sifting for gold, a back-breaking but sustainable lifestyle. However, more recently, outsiders with machinery offered the locals to do the work in exchange of a minimal proportion of the exploit. And exploit they did. They left the overturned soil barren and polluted the pristine rivers with diesel and mercury.</p>
<p>Today, the gold is gone and the town is paying a heavy price, not only environmentally but also socially as the gold rush brought drugs, prostitution and, most notably, the guerillas. For the National Liberation Army (ELN, in Spanish) is present and active in the area. Tadosanos refer to their security situation as the “public order issue”. The ELN often kidnaps Tadosanos for ransom, has laid out mines in the outskirts and even bombed the local police station in late 2014. The military and special forces are since involved in what can be described as a low-intensity conflict zone. It should not be a surprise that this town is out-of-bounds according to US, Canadian and UK official travel advisories.</p>

<h2>Our own story</h2>
<p>The Fabric of Humanity is a team of three. Nahuel is our visionary; an avid traveller as well as an economist and business consultant, he was the first to understand the profound impact that clothing can have to connect us to the human stories of the makers and to bring about opportunities in the places where they live. Wendy is our know-how girl, with 30+ years of detailed industry experience including product development, manufacturing and technical skill building. Mauricio is our storyteller with 15+ years of videography and documentary-making experience around the world. So, from us to you: <i>Hello!</i></p>

<h3>Where we go from here</h3>
<p>This campaign comes at a key moment for us. The funds we raise will allow us to undertake two equally important tasks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Deliver, for the first time, on the projects you pick. This will allow us to tell the stories of people and communities that you actually change for the better with our clothing. A living proof that The Fabric walks the walk. We are looking forward to building on the links we established with grassroots groups and community organizations in India and Nepal - and learn from the experience so that we can better roll out projects in other communities in the future.</li>
<li>Grow. Grow. Grow. Our first crowdfunding campaign was a successful test of concept. We have delivered on what we committed ourselves to and then some more. Now it is time to take The Fabric to the next level. We will use the funds we raise to implement more ideas that will make our altruistic shopping experience more comprehensive, invest in the necessary resources and bring more communities under our umbrella.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have a great team at The Fabric of Humanity. Not only do we have the qualifications and experiences to pull this off, we actually think this is what we are meant to do!</p>
<p>Like all startups, The Fabric has its risks and challenges, and we are conscious of them. Money is the bloodline to any business, and we are no exception. Overall, we are extremely excited to find awesome people like you to help us fund The Fabric and to help us get it to the next level.</p>
<p>Once we get the support we are looking for, we feel there is little risk in providing you with your very-well-deserved Perks. Our X'MAS early bird Perks are ready to ship as soon as we get your survey responses. And we have dependable and ethical production ready for the job for our April batch.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/190799755?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>We are fully transparent at The Fabric, as the trust that you place on us is of upmost importance to us. There are a few things that you should keep in mind in contributing to our project.</p>
<ul>
<li>The availability of our inventory for the X'MAS early bird Perks assumes customary demand patterns. That is, if it turns out that everybody is ordering M-sized units and no-one wants S's or L's, we may run out of M's before we are able to fulfil your Perk. We are keeping extra units at hand to try to minimize the likelihood of this scenario. Should it happen nonetheless, we will contact you as soon as possible and ask you how you'd like to proceed.</li>
<li> We will be placing a dedicated order for the Perks to be shipped in April. This timing works well with production lead times. In the event of an extraordinary demand for our Perks, it may be the case that we need to divide our production into two or more batches. If this were the case, we will do our best to minimize wait times and to process Perks in the order the contributions were received.</li>
<li>Our Indian Heritage shirts make use of upcycled trims for the inside collar, cuff, button placket and sleeve tab. Depending on the level of demand for these Perks, it may be the case that the exact trim may not be available. If this were the case, we would contact you as soon as possible and give you more trim options at the time.</li>
</ul>

The Stories (and community projects)

Tadó is a small town in Chocó, Colombia’s poorest region in the Pacific rainforest. The National Liberation Army (ELN), a Marxist guerrilla, continues to wrestle with state forces in one of the last active areas of Colombia’s armed conflict.

 
The Makers
Beatriz is a good example of what is untrue in the usual poor and lazy stereotypical portrait of the people of Chocó. She is full of energy and strives to make things better around her. She is the director of La Platina, a dance group designed to keep the local folkloric heritage alive and, at the same time, offer a positive pastime to youth that would otherwise be in danger. For years, she has sewn the dance group’s costumes.
Astrid’s eyes light up when she tells the story of her first times behind her mother’s sewing machine as a child. She was not allowed to touch it, lest she break it. In hiding, she would use any opportunity to have a go at the machine. One time the needle went through her nail and, in fear of being found out, she did not utter a sound. That's passion.
Alexander is a professional tailor. He does not have children of his own but is proud to support his extended family. Not a small feat for a physically handicapped individual in this part of the world. And it is proof that sewing is, in his own words, “my destiny”.
Silvia’s story is the most touching. Raised by an aunt who did not want her niece to do better than her own children, Silvia was held back from school. She married, and the story repeated itself: the husband restricted her to the house in his need to fill in the shoes of breadwinner. Unable to cope with the role, the husband shot himself in the living room in front of their children. Silvia was left with no education, no skills and three children to care for, the youngest just a baby. With Beatriz’s support along with that of the community, she “empirically” learned the clothes-making trade and, not short of pain and strife, over the years she has been able to put food on the table, a roof over their heads and put her eldest through university. Her youngest is doing well in school at 15. It is not all rosy: her middle child is an alcoholic at 18. But her story is a tremendous inspiration to overcoming obstacles.

The Community
Tadó is a town of some 10,000 people nested in the thick of the Pacific rainforest and almost exclusively populated by black decedents of former slaves. Until recently, the lack of decent roads kept this town relatively isolated, which is evident in the apparent slow pace of life as people great each other incessantly. But the slow pace is also an ingrained consequence of the lack of jobs. There are no official figures, but we were told that maybe 35% of people have employment. The town traditionally made do sifting for gold, a back-breaking but sustainable lifestyle. However, more recently, outsiders with machinery offered the locals to do the work in exchange of a minimal proportion of the exploit. And exploit they did. They left the overturned soil barren and polluted the pristine rivers with diesel and mercury.
Today, the gold is gone and the town is paying a heavy price, not only environmentally but also socially as the gold rush brought drugs, prostitution and, most notably, the guerillas. For the National Liberation Army (ELN, in Spanish) is present and active in the area. Tadosanos refer to their security situation as the “public order issue”. The ELN often kidnaps Tadosanos for ransom, has laid out mines in the outskirts and even bombed the local police station in late 2014. The military and special forces are since involved in what can be described as a low-intensity conflict zone. It should not be a surprise that this town is out-of-bounds according to US, Canadian and UK official travel advisories.

Our own story
The Fabric of Humanity is a team of three. Nahuel is our visionary; an avid traveller as well as an economist and business consultant, he was the first to understand the profound impact that clothing can have to connect us to the human stories of the makers and to bring about opportunities in the places where they live. Wendy is our know-how girl, with 30+ years of detailed industry experience including product development, manufacturing and technical skill building. Mauricio is our storyteller with 15+ years of videography and documentary-making experience around the world. So, from us to you: Hello!

 


 
Where we go from here
This campaign comes at a key moment for us. The funds we raise will allow us to undertake two equally important tasks.

Deliver, for the first time, on the projects you pick. This will allow us to tell the stories of people and communities that you actually change for the better with our clothing. A living proof that The Fabric walks the walk. We are looking forward to building on the links we established with grassroots groups and community organizations in India and Nepal - and learn from the experience so that we can better roll out projects in other communities in the future.
Grow. Grow. Grow. Our first crowdfunding campaign was a successful test of concept. We have delivered on what we committed ourselves to and then some more. Now it is time to take The Fabric to the next level. We will use the funds we raise to implement more ideas that will make our altruistic shopping experience more comprehensive, invest in the necessary resources and bring more communities under our umbrella.


 

Risks & Challenges
We have a great team at The Fabric of Humanity. Not only do we have the qualifications and experiences to pull this off, we actually think this is what we are meant to do!
Like all startups, The Fabric has its risks and challenges, and we are conscious of them. Money is the bloodline to any business, and we are no exception. Overall, we are extremely excited to find awesome people like you to help us fund The Fabric and to help us get it to the next level.
Once we get the support we are looking for, we feel there is little risk in providing you with your very-well-deserved Perks. Our X'MAS early bird Perks are ready to ship as soon as we get your survey responses. And we have dependable and ethical production ready for the job for our April batch.

We are fully transparent at The Fabric, as the trust that you place on us is of upmost importance to us. There are a few things that you should keep in mind in contributing to our project.

The availability of our inventory for the X'MAS early bird Perks assumes customary demand patterns. That is, if it turns out that everybody is ordering M-sized units and no-one wants S's or L's, we may run out of M's before we are able to fulfil your Perk. We are keeping extra units at hand to try to minimize the likelihood of this scenario. Should it happen nonetheless, we will contact you as soon as possible and ask you how you'd like to proceed.
 We will be placing a dedicated order for the Perks to be shipped in April. This timing works well with production lead times. In the event of an extraordinary demand for our Perks, it may be the case that we need to divide our production into two or more batches. If this were the case, we will do our best to minimize wait times and to process Perks in the order the contributions were received.
Our Indian Heritage shirts make use of upcycled trims for the inside collar, cuff, button placket and sleeve tab. Depending on the level of demand for these Perks, it may be the case that the exact trim may not be available. If this were the case, we would contact you as soon as possible and give you more trim options at the time.


And now, it's up to YOU!
That's all folks! So, take a look at our Perks again and start by choosing the item you'd like. Together we can make incredible things happen.",43.0,4,"1 Campaign

A fashion fabrics project
The aim of my work is to base production in Ivory Coast primarily in order to contribute to the growth and wealth of the locals.
Akwa utilizes handmade fabrics from craftsmen to create an elegant and trendy, yet simple clothing line.
There are many traditional fabrics and each region has its own particular styles and techniques.
They are part of popular history, and a precious heritage, which should be preserved, enhanced and shared. 
 


 
Goal
With your campaign contributions we aim to accomplish the following goals:
•Providing manufacturing and shipping for all the reserved perks from a trusted network of local craftsmen
•Writing a statute and a fair contract model for local workers•Renting a small manufactory for Akwa•Design & Implementation of the Akwa website and web shop•Producing the first Akwa collection•Traveling expenses to Côte d'Ivoire for business trips •Making a video documentary about the network
If we do not achieve full funding we will use the accumulated resources with the primary goal to create the perks for our supporters and the web shop.
 

 
Ivory Coast
The Ivory Coast is a strategic trade center in West Africa. Migrants from Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal, are moving to Ivory Coast, to find work. Ivory Coast is a place where you can meet the culture and traditions of many West African tribes.
There are lots of people who produce handmade goods and who are willing to offer their craftsmanship at an affordable price.
We wish to see a reevaluation of handmade and custom-made fashion in Europe and we are dedicated to create a connection between the buyers and craftsmen through the Akwa network.
 

 
Risks
We are aware that the uncertainty of crowdfunding can discourage buyers to buy foreign textiles online, but we hope to be able to solve this problem through a communications campaign which enables the supporters to get in touch with the suppliers, and keep track of the progress.

<p>My name is Tito Rosado. I am the founder of Transverse and creator of the very first boxers that hold your pants up. I am a husband and a father. I've been skateboarding for more than half of my life and I've been in retail management for over 15 years. I have always dreamed of starting my own company and wanted my brand to mean something more while creating something innovative to bring to the industry. </p>
<p>I came up with the idea over 5 years ago and it has been a side project I've worked on after work and weekends. After struggling with finding the right manufacturer, I was able to lock down a solid partner. I received so much positive feedback during our prototype testing that I knew I needed others to experience the comfort Transverse can bring. </p>
<p>While my initial Kickstarter campaign was not as successful as I'd hope, I was still fortunate enough to fund the first minimum purchase order to launch our product and get it into your hands.   Our product is ready to be shipped and sold as soon as our campaign comes to an end. </p>
<p>This has been a long journey and I cannot thank you enough for your support. After this campaign ends and all Indiegogo orders are fulfilled, I will open up the shop on our website to begin taking orders. </p>
<p>As this is our first product, I am always open for feedback and ways to improve. I look forward to hearing about your experience with Transverse!</p>

<h3>Why Northbound Notebooks?</h3>
<div> </div>
<p>Our story starts with Adam. <i>That's me.</i> </p>
<p>I've been a scribbler ever since I could hold a pencil. I spend a lot of time writing. I always will. I know there's something special about putting pen to paper.</p>
<p><b>It's where your ideas grow</b>. </p>
<p>I was tired of burning through expensive notebooks and their thin paper. So I turned to other options. I looked online. I searched far and wide. Dozens later, I was left frustrated. I couldn't find a solid refillable notebook with great paper. It was even harder to find something big enough for practical use. </p>
<p><b>Big ideas don't fit on tiny pages.</b> </p>
<p>That's around where I met up with an old friend. <i>That's Mark.</i> Turns out he had some great ideas about design, leather, and how we could make the coolest notebooks possible. </p>
<p>So we put our heads together. In a few quick months we built something really special. And we're here to share that with you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Let's make one for you.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442791705/aypkyflnbewegeyd6iz7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We start with locally sourced leather. We wanted something that would age and mark beautifully. It has to grow with your story and projects. You take pride in your own unique work. Your notebook should reflect that. So we cut and punch each piece by hand to make sure every notebook is as original as it's owner.</p>
<p>Then we add premium vellum paper. Well-reviewed and high performance notebooks have been using this stuff for a long time. It's a thicker paper at 100gsm. This means it has enough weight to hold heavier inks beautifully. We've sized it at A4, the international standard for paper. Each page measures 8.3"" x 11.7"" -- enough space for even your biggest ideas or designs. <b>We're offering options in lined or blank</b> for now.</p>
<p>We bind it all together with silver or brass hardware. The convenient binding makes it really easy to add or remove paper. You can keep your notebook going for years and years. Then we add a clip to keep it all sealed and looking sharp.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our goal &amp; your next notebook.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442793349/rokvksyrzn3kubypvhft.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're looking to secure orders and raise <b>$1,500 USD</b>. This is enough for us to get better rates on leather, paper, tools, and supplies we need to make this project a reality.</p>
<p>We're here to specialize on something. We aren't looking to create a notebook for everybody. We want to focus on an amazing experience for the creatives who need it. Each pledge takes us one step closer towards that goal.</p>
<p>Lets talk transparently. Our biggest flexible cost, believe it or not, is our paper. The larger quantity we can secure (that means the more notebook packages we pledge), the better price we can offer on our future refills. Our goal is to make great paper available at a fair price. Whenever you need it.</p>
<p>Putting your trust in us means a lot. We're just two guys who like to build and write and design. But if you stand beside us as a founding backer, you are sharing a commitment to authentic, hand-made goods. Why tell your story with anything less?</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; challenges.</h3>
</div><div> </div><div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442793773/upt0e6epvt4evpzjtibl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're a two man team. There's only so much we can tackle at once. Cutting leather too quickly has dangerous consequences. Those knives are sharp.</p>
<p>We want to ensure each notebook is the highest quality we can produce. So we're going to release them in batches. If you take an early-bird perk, we're going to try our damnedest to deliver for December 2015. That means we'll make it on time for an amazing gift or surprise for someone special.</p>
<p>If you miss that perk, don't worry. We'll get our next batch out in early 2016 at the latest.</p>
<p>And, lastly, an important note: we value original products. Each piece of leather has its own handsome markings and character. Each cut is handled differently on each hide. No two notebooks will look the same. Don't hide your personality. Get excited about what makes yours unique.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How 'bout them perks?</h3>
<div>
<p><b>[For any notebook perk, we will e-mail to confirm paper type (lined or blank)]</b></p>
<p><b>** Please note that due to overwhelming demand, and because we're just two guys, we are not able to guarantee December delivery unless previously stated. We're trying our best, and we don't want to let anyone down, but for orders made on or after Oct 8, shipping will likely be in early 2016. </b></p>
<p><b>Nice, Northbound. NICE - $5</b></p>
<p><i>Since you are being so great, helping us out, we're going to cut you a little piece of leather, sign it, and mail it to you anywhere in Canada or the continental USA. We'll even write something nice. Thanks for the support.</i></p>

<h3>More info and some quick things.</h3>

<div>
<p><b>Free Canadian shipping on all refill orders. Add $4 USD for USA.</b>  We know paying for shipping sucks, and especially for something you might order regularly. We want you to write, scratch, scribble, and create. So we’re eating this cost for you. Don’t worry about it. Our pricing for paper refills will be announced at the end of the campaign.</p> <p><b>Our notebooks are made from authentic, locally sourced leather.</b> That means they will wear with age and show their handsomeness with time. Because of the nature of untreated leather, each notebook will have its own story and imperfections.

Why Northbound Notebooks?
 
Our story starts with Adam. That's me. 
I've been a scribbler ever since I could hold a pencil. I spend a lot of time writing. I always will. I know there's something special about putting pen to paper.
It's where your ideas grow. 
I was tired of burning through expensive notebooks and their thin paper. So I turned to other options. I looked online. I searched far and wide. Dozens later, I was left frustrated. I couldn't find a solid refillable notebook with great paper. It was even harder to find something big enough for practical use. 
Big ideas don't fit on tiny pages. 
That's around where I met up with an old friend. That's Mark. Turns out he had some great ideas about design, leather, and how we could make the coolest notebooks possible. 
So we put our heads together. In a few quick months we built something really special. And we're here to share that with you.
 
 
Let's make one for you.

 
We start with locally sourced leather. We wanted something that would age and mark beautifully. It has to grow with your story and projects. You take pride in your own unique work. Your notebook should reflect that. So we cut and punch each piece by hand to make sure every notebook is as original as it's owner.
Then we add premium vellum paper. Well-reviewed and high performance notebooks have been using this stuff for a long time. It's a thicker paper at 100gsm. This means it has enough weight to hold heavier inks beautifully. We've sized it at A4, the international standard for paper. Each page measures 8.3"" x 11.7"" -- enough space for even your biggest ideas or designs. We're offering options in lined or blank for now.
We bind it all together with silver or brass hardware. The convenient binding makes it really easy to add or remove paper. You can keep your notebook going for years and years. Then we add a clip to keep it all sealed and looking sharp.
 

Our goal & your next notebook.
 
 

 
We're looking to secure orders and raise $1,500 USD. This is enough for us to get better rates on leather, paper, tools, and supplies we need to make this project a reality.
We're here to specialize on something. We aren't looking to create a notebook for everybody. We want to focus on an amazing experience for the creatives who need it. Each pledge takes us one step closer towards that goal.
Lets talk transparently. Our biggest flexible cost, believe it or not, is our paper. The larger quantity we can secure (that means the more notebook packages we pledge), the better price we can offer on our future refills. Our goal is to make great paper available at a fair price. Whenever you need it.
Putting your trust in us means a lot. We're just two guys who like to build and write and design. But if you stand beside us as a founding backer, you are sharing a commitment to authentic, hand-made goods. Why tell your story with anything less?


 
Risks & challenges.
 
 

 
We're a two man team. There's only so much we can tackle at once. Cutting leather too quickly has dangerous consequences. Those knives are sharp.
We want to ensure each notebook is the highest quality we can produce. So we're going to release them in batches. If you take an early-bird perk, we're going to try our damnedest to deliver for December 2015. That means we'll make it on time for an amazing gift or surprise for someone special.
If you miss that perk, don't worry. We'll get our next batch out in early 2016 at the latest.
And, lastly, an important note: we value original products. Each piece of leather has its own handsome markings and character. Each cut is handled differently on each hide. No two notebooks will look the same. Don't hide your personality. Get excited about what makes yours unique.
 
 
How 'bout them perks?

[For any notebook perk, we will e-mail to confirm paper type (lined or blank)]
** Please note that due to overwhelming demand, and because we're just two guys, we are not able to guarantee December delivery unless previously stated. We're trying our best, and we don't want to let anyone down, but for orders made on or after Oct 8, shipping will likely be in early 2016. 
Nice, Northbound. NICE - $5
Since you are being so great, helping us out, we're going to cut you a little piece of leather, sign it, and mail it to you anywhere in Canada or the continental USA. We'll even write something nice. Thanks for the support.

More info and some quick things.
 

Free Canadian shipping on all refill orders. Add $4 USD for USA.  We know paying for shipping sucks, and especially for something you might order regularly. We want you to write, scratch, scribble, and create. So we’re eating this cost for you. Don’t worry about it. Our pricing for paper refills will be announced at the end of the campaign. Our notebooks are made from authentic, locally sourced leather. That means they will wear with age and show their handsomeness with time. Because of the nature of untreated leather, each notebook will have its own story and imperfections. Get excited about yours. Why vellum paper? A thicker paper holds fountain pen ink and marker beautifully. Lines are cleaner, the writing motion is more fluid, and the end result is beautiful and inspiring. We could absolutely sell cheaper paper, but we won’t. Once you feel the difference you’ll understand. And you’ll want some more. How much will refills cost me? The short answer: We don’t know yet. The more we can manufacture and order at a time, the lower our paper costs will be. Refills will be sold in two or three packs, ranging from $5-10 per refill. Remember, our game plan is to guarantee free shipping for life on refills. Refills available only through northboundnotebooks.com. Want some specs? Each notebook measures about 9” x 12” x .5”. The leather is about ⅛ of an inch thick. The paper refills are in international A4 standard size.

Pairs well with stingy or generous pants, ups and downs, and definitely when looking smart.Powll BeigePowll Burgundy  The RbutusThe Rbutus is great for the runner that sometimes has to walk, too. The urban-outdoors are calling. Great for hikes, bikes, and getting likes. Pairs well with anything showing a little ankle; good shorts, wild tights, superwide denim, and even rolled up slacks.Rbutus White Rbutus Black  The LonsThe Lons is a marine classic for modern urbanites. Cool and casual. Great for boardwalks, top decks, and beach indulgence. Pairs perfectly with your closet-country-club get-up, your yacht ensemble, or easily with casual high-ankle denim or dungarees.Lons Storm GreyLons Black/White Here's a universal sizing chart. If you're in between sizes, better to go up.      We've spent the better part of 2 years engineering shoes that are designed to be better for your body, delivering uncompromising comfort, and never sacrificing style. The following 4 categories make-up the technology that gives SKYE Footwear the ultra-comfy promise. SKYE Impact + Rebound InsoleIt's like a gel bed with a rebounder. SKYE Impact is a built-in deep gel heel cup for impact absorption in the heel strike zone, for happy ankles. And SKYE Rebound is engineered with a springy gel to keep a natural bounce in your step, for happy walking.  The mid-arch is crafted for smart responsive anatomical support, making for stress-free feet and euphoric legs. And there’s an anti-stink layer to prevent the growth of odour-causing bacteria.Nose and knee gratitude aplenty.  SKYE Foam OutsoleIt's our ground warrior. The midsole is our ultra-soft, shock absorbing foam rubber base; our own patent pending design. The pillow-like EVA cushion compresses with every step and reforms back to full shape for seamlessly soft heel-to-toe movements.And it’s super light. Like walking on air. The Loop-LokInspired by SUPing. Our patent-pending Loop-Lok means a snug laceless fit around your foot, inspired by West Coast watersports like stand-up paddleboarding. The bungee cables loop and gently lock across the upper mid-foot, like a good hug.You never need to tie a knot. 4-way Stretch UpperThe form-fitter. The material-mix for the shape-fit upper gives true 4-way stretch for a premium form-fit feeling. The breezy breathable fabric feels like air to the toes, while the microfiber structure retains strength and support in its grip. Feet still think they’re naked. SKYE shoe anatomyEvery single detail contributes to the smooth, comfortable feeling of SKYE shoes.     Our backers get an amazing limited time price on SKYE shoes. The Early Bird VIP price is for the first of the first backers, and all backers get the VIP discount price.For the most dedicated individualistic SKYE lovers, we have custom color options and care kits in the higher tiers of perks. And of course, you can go right out and get the whole collection. Custom ColorwayFor the most individual of individualistic backers, the Custom Colorway perk gets you a personal consultation with our designer to select a completely unique color scheme for your pair. Yes, the only one in the world.The heel loop, upper materials, and Loop-Lok laceless feature can all be customized. The EVA outsole can be specified in either black or white.A few ideas...   As we mentioned, we've been at this for a while. Here's a quick look at everything we've done to date, and what lies ahead as we prepare the launch the shoes.   First of all, we love shoes. We’re mostly busy folks. Always travelling, working, bustling, and always on our feet. But we’re constantly left brokenhearted when our crazy little lifestyle doesn’t jive with our favorite pairs of shoes – great looks yet tired feet and sad knees. We were begging for stylish comfort.We set out to make shoes that do comfort like we dreamed. A beautiful everyday shoe that pairs with every outfit (the mark of a true favorite), built for real comfort and long, long wearing.​So comfy you feel like you never touch the ground.  So, we’ve spent 18 months designing and redesigning, searching and testing materials, never sacrificing comfort, never sacrificing style, never at the expense of poor labor conditions, and never at the cost of our precious planet.And. Here. We. Are.  With the success of this project, we'll have the funding to create shoe molds for all sizes, order materials, and meet the factory minimum quantities.    We’re not completely new to bringing a product to market.We’ve been coordinating manufacturing and developing footwear, accessories, and toys for a collective 30+ years. But this is our biggest and most exciting leap.We have been working on the lineup of SKYE products for over 18 months, iterating dozens of rounds of product development, finding and working with the best vendors for the perfectly calibrated shoe, for true comfort.  Our first small run of samples has been a great success. We’re thrilled to be bringing this idea tolife, and getting beautiful, ultra-comfy pairs of shoes into the hands of all our backers.Don’t hesitate to let us know if you have any questions or concerns.Email ForAlways@SKYEfootwear.com if you want to chat.  Domestic All shipping costs in the US and Canada* are a fixed additional cost depending on location. International We will ship internationally, using major carriers with tracking, so your new shoes get to you safely and as affordably as possible.     For international backers, there can be import duties or taxes when your order arrives. It’s important to us that your order and experience is smooth and comfortable, so get in touch with us and we’ll be happy to update you on what we’ve uncovered for your region.   We’re only happy if you’re super-comfy and look amazing.We’ll be sure to exchange your shoes so long as they are unworn, still have the tags attached, and you have the original receipt within 60 days of receiving the shoes.Once our shoes are available for retail (a few months after backers receive the early-birds), you’ll need to purchase your correct size from us at retail, and we’ll refund the difference.Email: MakeItComfy@SKYEfootwear.com and we’ll sort you out.   We are unbelievably grateful for your support in helping us reach our project goal, and in return we commit to your true comfort in SKYE Footwear.If there’s a manufacturing issue with your shoes, no problem, we’ve got it covered. If it’s more of a preference thing, we’ll get you into another pair of SKYE Footwear better suited for you.",37.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Perks range from unique Birds N Bones merchandise not sold on our website, to getting 10-30% off on your next order from us.You'd be at the forefront for getting these new designs from us and we'd be ever grateful for your support and help. It's just us two who make everything for Birds N Bones Jewelry and we need more capital in order to continue expanding our collections. With the donations we receive, you grant us the ability to purchase materials to create awesome designs, time to finalize the designs, and moola so we can launch with product photos as well as a look-book. We love making jewelry and we love having it reach people all over the world... we are just in need of funds to keep on creating and growing.Please donate if you can and share our campaign with friends and family. Thank you!!P.S. We get our animal bones and parts from sources like Paxton's Gate, natural history museum stores, and sometimes Amazon and Ebay. We always make sure they were ethically sourced and are from naturally deceased animals. We only use one of the bones/skulls/series-of-claws to make a mold from it and do all of our castings from the mold. The mold is injected with wax and then we use those in the ""lost wax"" casting process. There isn't actually a bone in our finished product, it's all sterling silver.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>My inspiration for this campaign is the aloe vera plant (as in ""A.Vera""), which aside from having nutritious leaves, also produces a gel that is soothing on the skin, suitable as a base for blending aromatherapy scents, and useful for the infusion of those scents into leather goods.  Whereas <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhIoNV-XZyc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my smartwatches use a Mediatek platform</a>, my aromatherapy wristwatches in this project will be based on an aloe vera one. </p>

<p>Personally, I have struggled with obesity since the age of 9.  For most of my adult life, I have been on a yo-yo diet roller coaster.  Undoubtedly, the stresses of life triggered and amplified the ups and downs.  My obesity went hand in hand with insomnia, migraines and hypertension.  In 2008, I had a<a href=""http://www.webmd.com/diet/weight-loss-surgery/lap-band-surgery"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Lap-Band</a> surgically installed and have since lost over 160 lbs.</p>

<p>The process of losing so much weight has made me reconsider how each of the senses inform my health and behavior.  No matter how much weight I lose, my ears, eyes, tongue and nose do not seem to get much smaller.  Thankfully.</p>
<p>Smell, which is inextricably linked to taste and touch, not only signals when and where it is time to eat - but what is safe and clean to breathe in, drink and even kiss.</p>

<p>At the same time, many humans (including myself) live and work in big, polluted megalopolises.  The words ""smell"" or ""odor"" to urbanites evoke memories of squalor, filth and decay.  We are trained to want no smell, just supermarket sterility. The supermarket experience itself has removed us farther from the hunting, gathering and gardening of our ancestors.  Everything has been air conditioned, hosed and sprayed to insulate us from disease and, unfortunately, from smells, flavors and textures.</p>

<p>The modern age means adaptation and accommodation to groups.  One of the first thing we've allowed ourselves to sacrifice for those groups are the joys of the senses.  We have tacitly accepted the idea that ""sniffing, snorting and smelling"" is now just for vagrants, criminals, hysterics, dogs, rodents and other critters. </p>
<p>I spent most of the last two years in China, where millions of pedestrians cover their face to protect themselves from contaminants in the air.  The simple pleasures of the nose are increasingly segregated to restaurants, massage parlors, spas, perfumeries and candle shops.  In Asia, there is still an association between scent and freshness.  This is precisely because food, water and air there has been polluted beyond the reach of even modern science's curative powers.  Chinese need to and do smell the things they buy, prepare and eat - to know if they are authentic and safe to consume.  We in the West have been spared this hassle, but at what cost?</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here is a break-down of how the $1000 will be used:</p> <ul> <li>Creation of four blended aloe vera oil based scented leather straps that each specifically promote (1) relaxation, (2) satiety, (3) energy and (4) joy.  At the moment, that would be lavender, bergamot, eucalyptus and jasmine respectively.  If you look at our perks, we  offer a variety of aromatherapeutic deliverables, aside from A.Vera watches, including: (1) scented straps that can put on your other wristwatches, (2) scented ink, (3) scented paper and even (4) scented gloves.  </li> <li>Creation of an A. Vera companion coffee table book that will help end users understand the value of how to incorporate wrist-worn aromatherapy into their overall wellness goals - weight loss, stress relief, pain management, etc.  (No guarantee the book itself will be scented, unless someone takes advantage of the Premier Enthusiast perk.)</li> <li>Creation of additional watch face designs that can remind wearers of complimentary, aromatherapeutic activities such as gardening, wine tasting, cooking, hiking, attending farmers markets, fishing, hunting, etc.  So far, we only have the one face design. </li>
<li>If we only raise a portion of the $1000 dollars, we will focus on the development of the scented leather oils.  The A.Vera companion book would then have to be an e-book not available in printed format.  Our target is to deliver A.Vera kits by June and launch more broadly via Amazon and luxury boutiques by the end of the year.</li>

<p><span style=""text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">In order to address what may go wrong with the scenting of the leathers, we will be warranting them for at least 1 year.  If a backer gets an A.Vera watch and hates the smell, we will replace it with a stronger/weaker scented strap.  Hopefully, after enough A.Vera backers have given us feedback, future A.Vera customers will find their timepieces to be therapeutic and something worth showing off.  As for the science itself, I can only guarantee that we will do our best to follow the literature - not that the watches or straps will ""definitely, every time, no matter what, for all people"" cause some direct change of condition, mood or behavior.  I see A.Vera aromatherapeutic effects being fairly benchmarked against Bath and Body Works consumer products, not against Pfizer and Merck medical devices and drugs.  The goal is to start now with Lavender, Bergamot, Eucalyptus and Jasmine, then expand to custom formulas based on end user feedback.</span></p>

</div></div>","A. Vera - A Bouquet On Your Wrist

My name is David Bychkov and I have a PhD in Media and Communication Studies. Since 1999, I have been a psychophysiology researcher and smartwatch manufacturer.  I believe that smell is one of the most powerful and unused modes of communication in the brain-body struggle for healthy eating. Clinical studies consistently demonstrate the power of aromatherapy to modulate emotions, improve sleep quality and provoke powerful memories.  In this Indiegogo campaign, I am pitching a line of aromatherapy-enhanced wristwatches called A.Vera.  My goal here is to help people achieve their physical and mental health goals by rediscovering their sense of smell.  



My inspiration for this campaign is the aloe vera plant (as in ""A.Vera""), which aside from having nutritious leaves, also produces a gel that is soothing on the skin, suitable as a base for blending aromatherapy scents, and useful for the infusion of those scents into leather goods.  Whereas my smartwatches use a Mediatek platform, my aromatherapy wristwatches in this project will be based on an aloe vera one. 
  Aloe Vera Gel Combined With:                                               Jasmine Essential Oil
    +                                                                                                            ....Or....Lavender Essential Oil                                                                                                                                                                                     ....Or....Eucalyptus Essential Oil 
                                                                                                                                                                                   ....Or....Bergamot Essential Oil 


                                                                         
Sensory Health - Why I Believe in Aromatherapeutic Leather Watches
Personally, I have struggled with obesity since the age of 9.  For most of my adult life, I have been on a yo-yo diet roller coaster.  Undoubtedly, the stresses of life triggered and amplified the ups and downs.  My obesity went hand in hand with insomnia, migraines and hypertension.  In 2008, I had a Lap-Band surgically installed and have since lost over 160 lbs.

                                                          
The process of losing so much weight has made me reconsider how each of the senses inform my health and behavior.  No matter how much weight I lose, my ears, eyes, tongue and nose do not seem to get much smaller.  Thankfully.
Smell, which is inextricably linked to taste and touch, not only signals when and where it is time to eat - but what is safe and clean to breathe in, drink and even kiss.

                           
Just as the aroma of bergamot and fennel can dampen cravings for sweets, lavender and vanilla fragrance can help some people fall asleep.   For one of our family's dogs, the simple smell of my wife's hand helps him fall asleep.  On a primal level, her scent means he is safe and loved.  Her scent is his sleeping pill.


At the same time, many humans (including myself) live and work in big, polluted megalopolises.  The words ""smell"" or ""odor"" to urbanites evoke memories of squalor, filth and decay.  We are trained to want no smell, just supermarket sterility. The supermarket experience itself has removed us farther from the hunting, gathering and gardening of our ancestors.  Everything has been air conditioned, hosed and sprayed to insulate us from disease and, unfortunately, from smells, flavors and textures.
This is a dog's supermarket, as far as his nose is concerned.

                       
The modern age means adaptation and accommodation to groups.  One of the first thing we've allowed ourselves to sacrifice for those groups are the joys of the senses.  We have tacitly accepted the idea that ""sniffing, snorting and smelling"" is now just for vagrants, criminals, hysterics, dogs, rodents and other critters. 
I spent most of the last two years in China, where millions of pedestrians cover their face to protect themselves from contaminants in the air.  The simple pleasures of the nose are increasingly segregated to restaurants, massage parlors, spas, perfumeries and candle shops.  In Asia, there is still an association between scent and freshness.  This is precisely because food, water and air there has been polluted beyond the reach of even modern science's curative powers.  Chinese need to and do smell the things they buy, prepare and eat - to know if they are authentic and safe to consume.  We in the West have been spared this hassle, but at what cost?
                          This is my sad nose en route to some meeting in Beijing.

                                                            
                         This is my energized nose refreshed by salty French sea breeze. 

                                      Why not just spray myself with aromatherapy air fresheners when I get hungry or cranky?  Certainly, there are a wide range of aromatherapy products already out there.  Some are even available in the supermarket.  So far, none of them are convenient to carry, none of them are fashionable, and none of them really get near my nose when I would need them (at the table or in bed).  They all have that chemical, factory after smell as well.  The standard aromatherapy delivery system is tainted by ozone or wax afterbirth.

A.Vera - A New Way to Transmit Aromatherapy

The A. Vera delivery system is soft, Italian calf skin leather.  There is something almost food-like about the A.Vera strap leather even before it is soaked in the fragrant oil.  This makes it even more tempting to touch and wear than a bottle of air freshener or a can of Perriair.

           Since 2013, I have been working with traditional wristwatch makers, leather artisans and essential oil producers to craft A. Vera.  From the start, my vision has been of luxury timepieces with interchangeable, Italian leather straps infused in aloe vera and other essential oils that promote fullness, comfort and rest. A. Vera backers can choose from a range of styles and scents based on their wellness goals. The scents last at least 1 year. The timepiece itself comes with a Japanese movement and 3-year warranty.

                      
The idea is to have a living, breathing bouquet on your wrist - not a dead, lifeless machine. Those who eat, sleep, work and play with their personalized A. Vera will have something to savor that helps fights off fatigue, depression, anxiety and compulsiveness.

             

I know that it seems unnatural to imagine someone at the dinner table sniffing or smelling something they wear.  From the 13th to 17th Century, the monarchs and nobility of France prized those glove makers who added scents to their leathers. Since then, leather tanneries around the world have used perfumes and scents that disguise the raw, rotten notes in dried cattle skin.  For hundreds of years, it was indeed fashionable to ""smell the glove.""  I am hoping to integrate the innovations in the science of aromatherapy with the fashion sensibilities of Catherine de Medici, who knew a thing or two. 


My team has already produced about 20 prototypes in three styles: white and black with Swarovski crystal elements on the case bezel (for ladies) and simple black with crystal elements on the face (for gentlemen).  Each of the Italian calf skin leather straps are perforated, interchangeable and contain an embedded layer soaked in aloe vera oil, hence the name ""A. Vera.""  Aside from its well known skin soothing properties, aloe vera oil itself is often used as a base in which to transmit additional scents.  I am looking to raise $1000 to expand the offering to include straps with more scent variations that address specific emotions, based on data from studies collected at the National Library of Medicine.  For example, ""A.Vera Peppermint"" for sugar cravings, ""A.Vera Sandalwood"" for insomnia, ""A.Vera Cucumber"" for stress, etc.

                  


What We Need & What You Get Here is a break-down of how the $1000 will be used:  Creation of four blended aloe vera oil based scented leather straps that each specifically promote (1) relaxation, (2) satiety, (3) energy and (4) joy.  At the moment, that would be lavender, bergamot, eucalyptus and jasmine respectively.  If you look at our perks, we  offer a variety of aromatherapeutic deliverables, aside from A.Vera watches, including: (1) scented straps that can put on your other wristwatches, (2) scented ink, (3) scented paper and even (4) scented gloves.   Creation of an A. Vera companion coffee table book that will help end users understand the value of how to incorporate wrist-worn aromatherapy into their overall wellness goals - weight loss, stress relief, pain management, etc.  (No guarantee the book itself will be scented, unless someone takes advantage of the Premier Enthusiast perk.) Creation of additional watch face designs that can remind wearers of complimentary, aromatherapeutic activities such as gardening, wine tasting, cooking, hiking, attending farmers markets, fishing, hunting, etc.  So far, we only have the one face design. 
If we only raise a portion of the $1000 dollars, we will focus on the development of the scented leather oils.  The A.Vera companion book would then have to be an e-book not available in printed format.  Our target is to deliver A.Vera kits by June and launch more broadly via Amazon and luxury boutiques by the end of the year.

          The ImpactI am one of the earliest pioneers of the smartwatch movement, having launched the Exmocare BT1 Bluetooth biosensor wristwatch in 2006.  Since then I have been trying to come out with more and more battery powered gadgets to put on the body.  There is still a genuine need for that when dealing with chronic and elderly care.  Nevertheless, I am taking a step back to consider how to incorporate nature and our own natural capacities into what we wear.  A.Vera is an opportunity for those of us who have become too encased in technology to literally wake up and smell the coffee.  I have done 99% of the work already on this project and would like this Indiegogo campaign to help me gauge if other people in the world also want to reconnect to aromas, scents and their own noses.


Risks & Challenges
How do we make the oils?  There are a wide variety of perfume experts (""noses"") in the world, some of whom were my students and colleagues at Universita' dell' Immagine in Milan, Italy.  Others work with massive fragrance production companies in Europe.  I have consulted with them to design oils that reflect the data I have already compiled from articles at the National Library of Medicine.  They have provided me the initial samples I needed for my first 20 prototypes and will continue to supply me going forward.  The main costs going forward are testing on leather samples at the timepiece and strap factories we work with in Asia.                                             
The following things can go wrong: (1) the scents we design may be subjectively perceived as too strong or too weak, (2) specific combinations of scents may fade from the leather too quickly, (3) the scents may not age well when exposed to household chemicals and cleaning soaps, (4) some people will disagree/argue about which scent best addresses which emotions and behaviors.
In order to address what may go wrong with the scenting of the leathers, we will be warranting them for at least 1 year.  If a backer gets an A.Vera watch and hates the smell, we will replace it with a stronger/weaker scented strap.  Hopefully, after enough A.Vera backers have given us feedback, future A.Vera customers will find their timepieces to be therapeutic and something worth showing off.  As for the science itself, I can only guarantee that we will do our best to follow the literature - not that the watches or straps will ""definitely, every time, no matter what, for all people"" cause some direct change of condition, mood or behavior.  I see A.Vera aromatherapeutic effects being fairly benchmarked against Bath and Body Works consumer products, not against Pfizer and Merck medical devices and drugs.  The goal is to start now with Lavender, Bergamot, Eucalyptus and Jasmine, then expand to custom formulas based on end user feedback.
With regards to the timepieces, we are partnering with one of the most respected watch factories in Asia - which happens to be owned by our teammate Ricky Tsang. They currently output 400,000 luxury wristwatches and straps per month, using Japanese, Swiss and Chinese movements.  I have visited their facilities repeatedly and am confident of their ability to produce on time.  Actually, this is the least stressful design or manufacturing project I have ever worked on (this would be the most stressful one, if you are curious).  The success or failure of A.Vera really boils down to understanding emotion and ""synaesthetics,"" as my early mentor Fabrizio Ferri calls it.
                                      
Our Team
Although I am the Creative Director of the A.Vera project, I am blessed to have a couple of key players helping me.  First on the roster is Ricky Tsang:
                              
Ricky is a master wristwatch maker of over 20 years experience.  Born in Hong Kong, Ricky has developed and produced luxury timepieces, leather straps and handbags for American, European and Asian brands.  He has also created his own luxury wristwatch brand, Subcrew.  As Ricky said, ""When I was still young I fell in loves with watches.  As I remember, I was given my first watch at 11 years old by my father.  It was an old watch that my father wanted to flow.  It didn't work too well but I loved it.  Everyday I wound it up and listened to the tick tock sound emanate from it. "" After completing design college in 1989, Ricky started out as a professional graphic designer and advertising campaign professional.  In 1992, he landed his first job in his lifelong career as a wristwatch designer.  In the first years, Ricky had to learn on his own by doing his own hand drawings and graphics, visiting component factories, learning how to make cases, duals, hands and straps.  ""Everyday was busy but fun,"" Ricky said,  ""And I found out that watches are beside me, like my wife and family.  It is one of the most important parts of my life.  Time has gone fast from 1992-2014...a total of 22 years I work in the watch industry.  I have witnessed the change of watches from timepieces to fashion icons, from daily equipment to a representation of lifestyle. Watches tell you the time and time reminds you everyday that you must continue on your roadmap and make your dreams come true.""  Ricky and I have worked together on smartwatches for the last two years and, as you can judge from the A.Vera watch designs, he is brilliant.
The other critical member of our team is Ying Yi He, our Project Coordinator:         
                                  
A Shunde-native, Ying Yi finished her bachelor's degree in 2012.  She speaks perfect English, Mandarin and Cantonese and served as a volunteer in the 2010 Asian Games.  Ying Yi has managed a variety of projects over the last two years, from product testing and quality control, customer care and human resources, to shipping logistics and factory inspections.  Over the last year, she has become a bit of an expert in wearables, having helped produce the Empath 2.1 video.  In her free time, Ying Yi likes to go bungee jumping in Macau, study graphic design and prepare to get her master's degree.  Her job on the A.Vera project is to ensure that Ricky gets his essential oils and our backers' perks are properly drop-shipped worldwide from Hong Kong.

turn a hobby into a business.  I began to sell at the local farmer's market, and when the demand became too great I enlisted hope from local ladies who needed work that they could do from home.  Unbeknowns to me, the law says that I can sew and sell my wares from my home, but I cannot have seamstresses sew for me in their homes.  AND, also unbeknownst to me, I was ""manufacturing"" because I was making a wearable robe.  If I had been only been making blankets I would not have been manufacturing.  You can imagine my surprise when the state cobbled a case against me and fined me $28,600 for these extraordinary offenses.  Who knew something like that could even happen?  I am now trying to convince my state representative to help me with legislation to change some of the laws that make this outrageous behavior by the California department of Labor even possible.  Apparently someone doesn't want any competition in the garment industry here.  If I can raise funds through crowd funding, it will lift the burden of paying these magnanimous fines, and allow me to continue to pursue my mission to have a small run of Gubby Gear manufactured in time for the Holidays this year.  What We Need I'm looking for enough funding to help pay my fines through the end of the year (1/2 the total), to pay for licensure, which is now double because I am an ""offender"", and purchase enough fabric and pay for my first run at contract manufacturing.$13,000 (1/2 the total fine), $1000 Licensure, $7,000 Manufacturing.If I can raise at least $5,000 it will give me enough runway to get started.All products offered are below retail, and all hand sewn by me, prior to manufacturing.  What You GetInfinity Scarf:  You've seen them, but you haven't seen one like this.  Choice of 3 colors, this scarf wraps twice around the head and is as soft as a kitten.  Choose pink, ivory, or grey zebra stripe.  $20 donation.     Lovey:  This Little Lovey is a BIG deal.  The baby can drag it around without ""dragging"" it around.  15 inches of soft fabulousness will be the only one at your daycare.  $25 donation.    Gubby Gear Basic Baby Blanket:  These blankets are made to fit each baby's individual personality.  Please choose baby blanket fabrics from my site www.gubbygear.com to choose just the right fabric for you, the leave your choice in the comments section of Indegogo.  $55

Our Solution


We’ve developed a range of stainless steel eco-bottles called The
MessageBottle. The idea is simple: Your Cause, Your Bottle.



Each bottle is color-coded and reflects your individual commitment to a wide range of environmental efforts and social causes. The proceeds from each bottle will fund a correlating cause. We’ve identified 17 different causes that are aligned with the UN Global Goals Initiative (www.globalgoals.org).  Our goal is to raise at least USD 30,000 to successfully manufacture the bottle. The first run will feature a First Edition Green Climate Action Bottle (Pictured above). Funds raised will go towards HeroesToo's EcoPledge program. You can learn more about the cause and how the funds will be used here: http://heroestoo.org/about-the-ecopledge/. As we raise more funds, we’ll introduce more causes and colors to the line.                                                       




***UPDATE 1***
We are proud to announce that we have teamed up with Masarang, an organization which protects endangered Asian species, promotes reforestation and empowers local communities. You now have the choice of donating your money to either our EcoPledge program or Masarang's reforestation initiatives in Indonesia when purchasing your MessageBottle.

***UPDATE 2***
After several requests from friends and supporters of HeroesToo, we have now decided to add a new bottle to our campaign - the solid green. The concept is the same; by preordering your MessageBottle you donate money to our EcoPledge, but now you have the choice of either getting the first edition stainless steel bottle with green lid, or the new special edition solid green bottle.

Reduces the need for single use plastic bottles
Supports great causes

                                                 

What We Need & What You Get


With your contribution
we can start manufacturing the first of many MessageBottles.  Early birds
will also be entitled to a limited edition neoprene sleeve with their bottle:
             
As
the success of the MessageBottle grows, we hope to manufacture different
colors of the bottle to benefit other causes in line with the UN Global
Goals such as gender equality and poverty alleviation.
Join our campaign to create the MessageBottle for a better planet.
      One Bottle, Global Impact

The Impact 

1. Reduce single use plastic bottles-with billions of
plastic bottles ending up in landfill and entering our oceans, plastic is
negatively affecting our wildlife and environment.  You can help make a difference by using a
reusable water bottle instead of buying drinks bottled in single use plastics.
2. Support the EcoPledge Program in schools in
Hong Kong, Canada, United States and United Kingdom initially, then in schools
in other countries.
3. Support other environmental and social programs in line
with the UN Global Goals.
Our goal is to raise at least USD 30,000 to successfully
manufacture the bottles and raise partial funds for the EcoPledge Program, but with
more funding, we’ll be able to support more schools in addition to backing other charities once we’ve passed this target! One Bottle-Global Impact!

A watch enthusiast for years, Stijn decided to create his own brand and infuse his passion into the market. He’s well-versed in the nuances of vintage and heritage timepieces and approached Méraud’s designs from the mindset of a passionate collector.Méraud’s mission is to create exceptional, yet affordable vintage-inspired timepieces. The result is the Méraud Bonaire. A mechanical timepiece built by modern standards with a pure design where form follows function.""Onyx Black""""Marine Blue""""Graphite Grey""""Méraud Bonaire - lume shot""Méraud's inaugural model is the Méraud Bonaire dive watch. The name Méraud is derived from the French word for emerald (émeraude), symbolizing something precious. Bonaire is a Caribbean island that’s also known as ‘Diver’s Paradise’.  The Bonaire has a case size of 39mm and a thickness of 12,5mm, including the crystal. Lug to lug it measures 48,50mm. The Bonaire’s unidirectional diver’s bezel design was inspired by the Bakelite bezels from the 1950s and 1960s and is finished with a scratch-resistant sapphire to complement the active lifestyles of our time. It will be available with three different dial variations (you will be asked to choose the one you'd like at the end of the campaign).""Onyx Black""The Bonaire ""Onyx Black"" comes with a deep gloss black dial. The lume markers are filled with patina-like C3 Swiss SuperLuminova®. The indexes are applied and polished steel. Slightly domed sapphire crystal with anti-reflective coating on the inside.

The STP1-11 operates at 28,800 beats per hour and offers a 44-hour power reserve. The movement has a “perlage” finish, while the rotor has the “Côte de Geneve” finish and Méraud signature. The movement is modified to a no-date movement, all components releated to the date have been removed. Upon request STP has adjusted the movements that there are only 2 crown, one for winding and one position to set the time. Photo of the modified STP1-11 caliber used in the BonaireThis video below gives a good view on the production facilities of Swiss Technology Production, the manufacturer that is producing the movements for each Méraud Bonaire. Staying true to the watches of the 60's, the elegant 316L stainless steel cases measure a perfect 39mm. In addition, the cases are finished with striking contrasts thanks to a mix of linear, circular, and high-polished brushed finishes.With a height of 12,5mm and a classical case build the watch has a masculine, elegant and sporty look on the wrist. Perfect for any occasion. Thanks to the drilled lugholes the straps can easily be exchanged by using the strap tool that is added with the package. The screwed caseback has a polygon shape referring to the casebacks from back in the day. It's a minimalistic approach and it's finished by a combination of circular brushing and sandblasting.

<div>On top of the Time Teller review, we've also been written about by the acclaimed <strong>Steve Huyton</strong>, who writes about all things design (Architecture, art, horology, design, etc) for <strong>Esquire Magazine</strong> and on his own blog: Total Design Reviews</div>
<div> </div>
<div>He's a published author and reviewer of over 3 books on horology and design, including one that specifically covers 6-figure ultra-luxurious timepieces. Here's a link to just one of of his 3 published books on horology:</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Being that he’s such an authority on all things design and especially since he’s reviewed other 6-figure tourbillon timepieces before, it’s an honor to receive a glowing review from him about the work we’re doing here at ERA. You can read his review on our ERA Prometheus here:</div>

The ERA Prometheus is our first model, which features a skeletonized HZ3360A Tourbillon movement with a GMT / Dual timezone complication on the left and a sun-moon complication on the right. ERA Timepiece's CEO is Michael Galarza, who started the company by partnering up with master watchmakers that he's met over the years through his luxury goods distribution business.<br/><br/>Our concept seems to have legs, as we raised $50K before even launching on Kickstarter, then another additional $175K in 1 week on Kickstarter, and then hit the $700K mark in less than 4 weeks after launching.<br/><br/>This proves that regular people want Tourbillons to be accessible to them. They want tourbillon timepieces that created by a real brand that understands how to do proper branding and all the details associated with that, yet isn't trying to price gouge because they need to spend the bulk of their advertising budget on celebrity sponsorship deals.<br/><br/>The inspiration of our branding as you can see from our logo is Art Nouveau, and centered around the time period of the Great Gatsby. So streamline, black chrome blue color palette, early Rimowa suitcases, etc.</p><p>Leading ERA Timepieces is Michael Galarza, who has been enthralled with timepieces since before he could read and write. One of his earliest memories is sitting in the corner of the room, with his ear to a pocketwatch that his father owned, listening to its rhythmic beating.<br/><br/>As an adult, he created a boutique luxury goods sourcing and distribution business that specialized in helping companies find the highest quality suppliers worldwide. From the farms that provide the wool that eventually go into a famous British brand's hallmark checkered cashmere scarves to the leatherworkers who produce leather bags for famous French and Italian brands, Michael has a knack for identifying the world's absolute best quality producers in emerging economies.<br/><br/>As he got to know the producers better, he came to a realization that the actual price he could get these same products made for was many times 10% or 5% of what the eventual retail markup was -- far far below what the famous luxury brands charged for them and much higher than the usual markups in standard wholesaling. He realized that the crazy markup was required for these brands to keep paying for celebrity endorsements and sponsoring global sporting events to try to increase brand strength.<br/><br/>The luxury watch segment of the market was especially egregious, as he got to know more master watchmakers and boutique horological shops that made turnkey watches for large Swiss conglomerates, who would use a loophole in the weakness of the trade directive term ""Swiss Made"" to just ship an engraved rotor from Switzerland to China, and then source and make 100% of the rest of the watch there, and then it would ship directly to its final point of sale.<br/><br/>And so he decided to see if there was a market for people who cared about receiving a quality timepiece without an overly inflated budget for marketing dollars, who wanted a true timepiece that was worth its value. And so he decided to create a quality dependable Tourbillon timepiece that would be under $1000 that would still have all the hallmarks found in higher end watches.<br/><br/>That was how the ERA prometheus was born.</p><div data-id=""22470328""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1540405144/wrylg3d4ehljqzjr82le.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""22477433""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p>

It was made to counter the ill effects of gravity on the accuracy of his timepieces.</p><p>Breguet’s solution was to create an escapement that was constantly in a state of motion. Called the tourbillon (French for “whirlwind”), the escapement is housed in a rotating cage that, because of the constant motion, averages out the effect of gravity when the watch is stuck in different positions. </p><p>They’ve remained common among the uppermost echelon of the watch market. Most Swiss-made examples start at around $40,000 and price tags often break the six-figure barrier. </p><p>This is because tourbillons are arguably one the most difficult movement to make by hand. The tourbillon mechanism is tiny, weighing in at under a gram, and is usually crafted with more than 40 parts, finished by hand and made from lightweight metals like aluminum and titanium. They require a special set of tools and a lot of time to make. For example, just to make a single A. Lange &amp; Söhne Tourbograph Pour le Merite, its tourbillon chronograph movement takes 18 months.</p><p><em><strong>I saw a tourbillon for $100 - what’s the difference?</strong></em></p><p>Simply put, those aren’t tourbillons. </p><p>These are scammers that are trying to pass off an open heart / flywheel off as a real tourbillon.  They are preying on the customer thinking they can see some simple gears and equating it with a tourbillon. What you are probably seeing is an attempt by a Chinese seller to pass a regular mechanical watch as a tourbillon-like watch.</p><p>They are allowed to advertise in such a confusing and possibly ill-intention manner because the platform (aliexpress, amazon, ebay, etc.) lets them.</p><p>There are no trusted brands who sell mechanical tourbillon watches for under $1000.</p><p>And that’s why we created ERA</p><p><em><strong>Is your tourbillon real? How is it so much less expensive?</strong></em></p><p>There is no such thing as a “real” or “fake” tourbillon. You either have the mastery to make it or you don’t. </p><p>And most cannot - they are a feat of technology and creativity, both beautiful to look at and very difficult to make by hand. . </p><p>That’s why tourbillon watches will always be pricey.</p><p>But by breaking through the cartel and monopoly, we are able to get you a world-class tourbillon for on average 99% OFF what you would pay for another similar Tourbillon.</p><p><em><strong>Will I be forced to pay high VAT / Customs fees?</strong></em></p><p>We strive to keep costs as low as possible for you, although you are responsible for any import tariffs.  We have the infrastructure necessary to customize the appropriate declared value so after consulting with your local import tax authority, send us a message though and we will surely be able to work with whatever value you need us to declare.</p><p><em><strong>What about servicing for my watch?</strong></em></p><p>Mechanical masterpieces like our Tourbillons have parts that move tens of thousands of times a day, and over a few years... the lubricating oil inside evaporates and parts wear down... and so servicing a mechanical timepiece every 3 years is absolutely essential.</p><p>Now if you're familiar with servicing any Swiss mechanical watch, you'll know they don't ever charge less than $450 and that's not counting shipping or other extra fees for parts etc. For many brands, servicing a Tourbillon starts between $1500 and $4000 USD.</p><p>We created ERA timepieces with a simple mission -- to make haute horological complication attainable for normal people. We knew our timepieces wouldn't be very attainable for normal people if we kept up this same tactic, and so that's why have an EXTREMELY lucrative flat-rate $150 servicing fee that covers parts, labor, and EXPRESS global DHL shipping with 100% insurance both TO our service center and back to you for just $150.</p><p>Just shoot us a message when you want your watch serviced, and we'll take care of the rest!</p><p><em><strong>Technical Questions?</strong></em></p><p>We are avid readers of watchuseek and consider ourselves watch nerds. We are very open to a healthy discussion regarding a myriad of topics like: movement, sensitivity, movement comparisons, tourbillon comparisons, price vs value, etc.</p><p>We only ask that you backup your claims with data or relevant technical images, because whenever we can - we will as well.</p><div data-id=""22470549""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1540405146/tp1qh0aqur7pv1ot1tsm.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>With a project of this scale, there are almost countless people we need to thank, because without their help: our project would never have came together. </p><p>So special thanks to the many members of watchuseek.com for constantly taking the time to answer obscure questions.

Most Funded Tourbillon Watch & Most Funded NYC Watch Campaign IN HISTORY.

  We all want millionaire watches. You know the kind.Watches so unique, they are instant conversation starters.Watches so expensive, they stun the room and make people whisper our name.Watches with that ONE thing that make them cost more than a house -- the Tourbillon.Put a tourbillon into any watch — the price explodes: Six Figures. Seven Figures. INSTANTLY.The world’s most expensive watches??No surprise - they are all tourbillons.  Want to buy a tourbillon for five figures? Good luck. The New York Times says that is almost impossible. Clearly tourbillon watches are out of reach for me and you, for nearly everyone. Yet...do they have to be? When you think about making a more inexpensive tourbillon, simply “cutting out the middlemen” or “eliminating manufacturer markup” won’t bring down the price of tourbillon watches. Those are overused marketing buzz words for making yet ANOTHER “affordable luxury” watch. This is harsh language but it needs to be said. Any brand that talks about “cutting middlemen” and selling true luxury watches “direct to consumer” is telling you a nice fairy tale. It sounds nice in practice but it isn't based in reality whatsoever. Why?  Because in reality: a basic minimal watch with a turnstile Miyota movement can NEVER be a luxury watch.It's putting lipstick on a pig. You are paying a “luxury” price for craftsmanship on par with a Walmart bargain bin watch.What you’re getting isn’t “affordable luxury”, you’re paying $270 for a fabricated story and $19 for a cheap watch.This isn't bringing you affordable luxury - it is robbing you. Fortunately, or unfortunately for us, we just saw that tourbillon watches really ARE 6 or 7 figures. Again if that sounds insane - I agree with you 100%. But what is even more insane, what will REALLY make you mad...is the reason they are so expensive. And the reason is all too familiar; a small group is controlling nearly everything. There is actually a ""secret watch society” actively price gouging high-end timepieces and stopping us from wearing what we want.  To uncover this unfairness, we first need to see why tourbillon watches are intrinsically so valuable. Only then can we know and what is or isn’t fair to pay for them. Here’s why they will always be pricey...Manufacturing Precision In order to make a tourbillon, expert machinists use million dollar equipment like the Willemin 5-Axis. These machines give form and function to finest of raw materials. This machine transforms precious metals into the cases, bezels, fasteners, and dials of your tourbillon watch.Want an ultra high-end watch?  Then you need high-end watch parts.  And high-end watch parts can only come from high-end machines. A tourbillon cannot be built in an environment that is less than perfect. Every piece is made precise and accurate. The margin of error is only microns. But these are JUST the watch parts.We haven't even begun the Grand Ballet of Watch Assembly yet.100s Of Hours Of DetailBecause you see, after machining, these intricate parts are hand-worked. The attention each piece receives walks a fine line between obsession and passion. You don’t just have one watchmaker dedicated to making your timepiece. A small army of master horologists add hours...and hours - of laser focused, hand-crafted detail.And It takes 100s of painstaking hours to make ONE tourbillon. Yet hyper-focused eyes and minds are not enough. To successfully build a tourbillon timepiece, you need the most important ingredient of all.Watchmaking MasteryMaster watchmakers are the only ones capable of building a tourbillon. Only through years and years of training, practice, and learning can they tackle complications such as minute repeaters, grand sonnier, and the tourbillon.Because for these elite artisans, it isn’t just watchmaking. They approach their craft like its heart surgery. And this tourbillon assembly? That’s a HEART TRANSPLANT.If all this seems excessive, remember - NOTHING about a tourbillon watch is supposed to be “affordable” or “normal” or “accessible”.From the million dollar equipment, to the surgically precise watch partsFrom 100s of artisanal labor hours, to the world-class fingers of the horologists:A Tourbillon IS the supercar of watches, A marvel of engineering,And... expensive.But does it really have to be THAT expensive? Does it really have to be THAT ridiculously priced? We believe no watch should be beyond our grasp. ERA represents the first way to finally access ultra high end watches. We are the only solution to the question:How Do You Buy Millionaire Watches For Under $1000?Hopefully you are skeptical. Knowing how tourbillons are now made, how is it even remotely possible to buy them for 3 figures? Great instincts. Remember that watch “secret society” we mentioned earlier? The one purposely keeping you away from the watches you love, purposely holding you back. Lets expose them. See, the ultra-luxury watch brands are making fools out of you and me. We are being lied to and manipulated by a select group of corporations, AGAIN. Remember: we just saw that only elite watchmakers can build a tourbillon.But... the ultra-luxury brands control the world’s elite watchmakers.So, you want a tourbillon watch? No problem. You can get one through a luxury watch brand and they will charge you anywhere from $100,000 to even $1,000,000 dollars or more.Don’t like that price?Too bad.Who else is going to make the watch for you?  The luxury watch brands control the world’s elite watchmakers.If that sounds like an unfair monopoly or cartel -- you’re right. It Is But here at ERA, we want to finally break this monopoly and we are in a unique position to do so.Having first worked as luxury brand distributors, we got to see “behind the scenes” and how things worked in the watch industry.More importantly after years of networking and forming strategic partnerships:We got to know the same master watchmakers who build tourbillons for the luxury brand cartel. By partnering with these same master watchmakers, we broke through the cartel wall.  And together with these master watchmakers, we finally made the world’s first ever accessible tourbillon. In Greek mythology Prometheus stole fire from the Gods and gave it to mankind.He took from those with unlimited power, and shared a gift that was meant for all.Inspired by this timeless myth, we made a tourbillon watch attainable for all.Made EXACTLY like other tourbillon watches, the ERA Prometheus comes with a lower half, exposed mechanism.Here we see the balance wheel, pallet fork, hairspring: watchmaking virtuosity in full display.Other than the show-stopping Tourbillon, the ERA Prometheus has even more complications that you would expect from a 6-figure watch.Every timepiece is detailed and engraved with gears and other flourishes. Such as a 24 hour GMT Timer on the left and a dual revolving sun-moon dial on the right. All these mechanisms are housed behind beautiful sapphire crystal and a special made stainless steel body. As befitting for a watch of its caliber, the Prometheus also features a hornback leather croc style band that is stitched with premium midnight blue threading.Alternate Strap ColorsWe originally didn't want to offer brown bands with this particular model because we are extreme horological and design purists here, and brown doesn't usually go with the blues we have on the dial of our timepiece (earth tone palettes and cool ones usually don't go together).That being said, we still took some photos with some prototype sourced brown hornback croc bands and put them on our Instagram for fun awhile back.After so many of our fans wrote in wanting them, we took a hard look at our stance and we're pleased to announce we are going to give our customers what they want.In Total, we now have 5 colors to choose from, and 2 bezel finishes:

Lastly on the back, each watch is engraved with a unique serial number. So your timepiece will be a limited edition and always, one of a kind.The finest timepieces must be stored in the finest way, so it's no surprise that we have a hand-crafted and polished lacquered wood box to house your legendary timepiece.And as amazing as it already looks -- this box shown here is actually just a prototype, the final version will be even more custom and stunning!We're proud to announce that we will be introducing other variants for those who simply must have the finest Tourbillon upgrade pick:  The ERA Prometheus Titan Edition 


The ERA Prometheus Titan Edition is a special limited-edition versions that feature over 2.3 carats and over 78 gigantic diamonds that have been fused with the bezel and stretched around all surrounding metallic surfaces.It features a PLATINUM bezel and all the diamonds on both are natural Bright cut round GH colored diamonds with a clarity of VS1.The Titan Edition is meant for a real world Titan, like the current UNDEFEATED, UNDISPUTED WBA Super Bantemweight World Champion Ryan Burnett.  He is a huge fan of what we're doing at ERA and can be seen here wearing the ERA Prometheus Titan Edition with over 78 diamonds and 2.3 carats at his world title defense:But with such amazing timepieces, it's important to remember that while your tourbillon timepiece is bound to attract a lot of attention,  owning an ERA Prometheus is not about flaunting a 6 figure timepiece. It’s about - NO WATCH being beyond our grasp. It’s about - NO ONE telling us where our place is in life.It’s about - NOTHING being impossible to get.If you agree with that...then please, back our timepieces and support our kickstarter. 
For those of you who want a completely UNBIASED review, here is one from critically acclaimed watch reviewer: the Time Teller:

 
On top of the Time Teller review, we've also been written about by the acclaimed Steve Huyton, who writes about all things design (Architecture, art, horology, design, etc) for Esquire Magazine and on his own blog: Total Design Reviews
 
He's a published author and reviewer of over 3 books on horology and design, including one that specifically covers 6-figure ultra-luxurious timepieces. Here's a link to just one of of his 3 published books on horology:

Being that he’s such an authority on all things design and especially since he’s reviewed other 6-figure tourbillon timepieces before, it’s an honor to receive a glowing review from him about the work we’re doing here at ERA. You can read his review on our ERA Prometheus here:

And right now Erik Slaven of Monochrome Watches, which is Europe’s LARGEST watch publication and #5 in the world is reviewing it and will have his review up in a few weeks.
 We pride ourselves in being the most most accessible high-end tourbillon timepieces in the market. So for a full 24 months (2 Years):If your watch is suffering from any mechanical defect, we will gladly service it for free during this time and make it right.We are aiming to make our shipping fees as quick and as affordable as possible. And although you are responsible for local duties and fees, we will strive to make VAT, custom duties, and taxes as low as possible for you.Diameter: 44 mm           Thickness: 12.72 mmAccuracy: +/-25 seconds/dayPower Reserve:  ~42hoursFrequency: 28,800 vphJewels: 20Case: Hand Finished 316L Stainless Steel Crystal: Ultra Scratch-resistant Sapphire GlassWater Resistance: 5 ATM / 50 MetersMovement: HZ3360A TourbillonStrap: Black Hornback Style 100% Leather With Midnight Blue StitchingWeight: 3.53oz / 100 gramsERA Timepieces set out with one singular goal -- to take haute horlogerie complications and make them accessible to the common man. The ERA Prometheus is our first model, which features a skeletonized HZ3360A Tourbillon movement with a GMT / Dual timezone complication on the left and a sun-moon complication on the right. ERA Timepiece's CEO is Michael Galarza, who started the company by partnering up with master watchmakers that he's met over the years through his luxury goods distribution business.Our concept seems to have legs, as we raised $50K before even launching on Kickstarter, then another additional $175K in 1 week on Kickstarter, and then hit the $700K mark in less than 4 weeks after launching.This proves that regular people want Tourbillons to be accessible to them. They want tourbillon timepieces that created by a real brand that understands how to do proper branding and all the details associated with that, yet isn't trying to price gouge because they need to spend the bulk of their advertising budget on celebrity sponsorship deals.The inspiration of our branding as you can see from our logo is Art Nouveau, and centered around the time period of the Great Gatsby. So streamline, black chrome blue color palette, early Rimowa suitcases, etc.Leading ERA Timepieces is Michael Galarza, who has been enthralled with timepieces since before he could read and write. One of his earliest memories is sitting in the corner of the room, with his ear to a pocketwatch that his father owned, listening to its rhythmic beating.As an adult, he created a boutique luxury goods sourcing and distribution business that specialized in helping companies find the highest quality suppliers worldwide. From the farms that provide the wool that eventually go into a famous British brand's hallmark checkered cashmere scarves to the leatherworkers who produce leather bags for famous French and Italian brands, Michael has a knack for identifying the world's absolute best quality producers in emerging economies.As he got to know the producers better, he came to a realization that the actual price he could get these same products made for was many times 10% or 5% of what the eventual retail markup was -- far far below what the famous luxury brands charged for them and much higher than the usual markups in standard wholesaling. He realized that the crazy markup was required for these brands to keep paying for celebrity endorsements and sponsoring global sporting events to try to increase brand strength.The luxury watch segment of the market was especially egregious, as he got to know more master watchmakers and boutique horological shops that made turnkey watches for large Swiss conglomerates, who would use a loophole in the weakness of the trade directive term ""Swiss Made"" to just ship an engraved rotor from Switzerland to China, and then source and make 100% of the rest of the watch there, and then it would ship directly to its final point of sale.And so he decided to see if there was a market for people who cared about receiving a quality timepiece without an overly inflated budget for marketing dollars, who wanted a true timepiece that was worth its value. And so he decided to create a quality dependable Tourbillon timepiece that would be under $1000 that would still have all the hallmarks found in higher end watches.That was how the ERA prometheus was born. 
 What exactly is a tourbillon?A tourbillon is the invention of famed watchmaker Abraham-Louis Breguet. It was made to counter the ill effects of gravity on the accuracy of his timepieces.Breguet’s solution was to create an escapement that was constantly in a state of motion. Called the tourbillon (French for “whirlwind”), the escapement is housed in a rotating cage that, because of the constant motion, averages out the effect of gravity when the watch is stuck in different positions. They’ve remained common among the uppermost echelon of the watch market. Most Swiss-made examples start at around $40,000 and price tags often break the six-figure barrier. This is because tourbillons are arguably one the most difficult movement to make by hand. The tourbillon mechanism is tiny, weighing in at under a gram, and is usually crafted with more than 40 parts, finished by hand and made from lightweight metals like aluminum and titanium. They require a special set of tools and a lot of time to make. For example, just to make a single A. Lange & Söhne Tourbograph Pour le Merite, its tourbillon chronograph movement takes 18 months.I saw a tourbillon for $100 - what’s the difference?Simply put, those aren’t tourbillons. These are scammers that are trying to pass off an open heart / flywheel off as a real tourbillon.  They are preying on the customer thinking they can see some simple gears and equating it with a tourbillon. What you are probably seeing is an attempt by a Chinese seller to pass a regular mechanical watch as a tourbillon-like watch.They are allowed to advertise in such a confusing and possibly ill-intention manner because the platform (aliexpress, amazon, ebay, etc.) lets them.There are no trusted brands who sell mechanical tourbillon watches for under $1000.And that’s why we created ERAIs your tourbillon real? How is it so much less expensive?There is no such thing as a “real” or “fake” tourbillon. You either have the mastery to make it or you don’t. And most cannot - they are a feat of technology and creativity, both beautiful to look at and very difficult to make by hand. . That’s why tourbillon watches will always be pricey.But by breaking through the cartel and monopoly, we are able to get you a world-class tourbillon for on average 99% OFF what you would pay for another similar Tourbillon.Will I be forced to pay high VAT / Customs fees?We strive to keep costs as low as possible for you, although you are responsible for any import tariffs.  We have the infrastructure necessary to customize the appropriate declared value so after consulting with your local import tax authority, send us a message though and we will surely be able to work with whatever value you need us to declare.What about servicing for my watch?Mechanical masterpieces like our Tourbillons have parts that move tens of thousands of times a day, and over a few years... the lubricating oil inside evaporates and parts wear down... and so servicing a mechanical timepiece every 3 years is absolutely essential.Now if you're familiar with servicing any Swiss mechanical watch, you'll know they don't ever charge less than $450 and that's not counting shipping or other extra fees for parts etc. For many brands, servicing a Tourbillon starts between $1500 and $4000 USD.We created ERA timepieces with a simple mission -- to make haute horological complication attainable for normal people. We knew our timepieces wouldn't be very attainable for normal people if we kept up this same tactic, and so that's why have an EXTREMELY lucrative flat-rate $150 servicing fee that covers parts, labor, and EXPRESS global DHL shipping with 100% insurance both TO our service center and back to you for just $150.Just shoot us a message when you want your watch serviced, and we'll take care of the rest!Technical Questions?We are avid readers of watchuseek and consider ourselves watch nerds. We are very open to a healthy discussion regarding a myriad of topics like: movement, sensitivity, movement comparisons, tourbillon comparisons, price vs value, etc.We only ask that you backup your claims with data or relevant technical images, because whenever we can - we will as well.With a project of this scale, there are almost countless people we need to thank, because without their help: our project would never have came together. So special thanks to the many members of watchuseek.com for constantly taking the time to answer obscure questions. Ariel from ablogtowatch.com for his insightful articles, MHC for showing us the beautiful process of making a tourbillon, Watchfinder&Co for their insightful video analysis, and our beta users for all their feedback and reviews!

We would like to thank each and every one of you for all of your support this month! It was a truly exciting campaign. We will be launching our official website this weekend.  
Stay tuned and Stay Positive,Anthony Gracey & The Selftees Team






What is a Selftee?


It's the socially conscious t-shirt that blends positive causes with positive virtues. We wanted to make a tee that represented what YOU stand for... and stand UP for. That’s why every Selftee donates 20% of all sales to a specific cause, which was carefully matched with each design.





Positivity is contagious! When you wear a Selftee:

You're going to feel good, look good, and others will notice. Selftees are a natural conversation starter and morale booster.

You're going to feel empowered knowing that you're doing your part to help those less fortunate than yourself in your community and worldwide.














The design is made with clean typography and uses color theory to further enrich each tee's message. Every shirt is a modern slim fit and made in the USA.



What Does Your Selftee Mean To YOU?

We asked our original Selfteem members what their favorite Selftee was, and what it meant to them. Here's what Yan had to say about it:



The Selftees Mission
We hope to raise $200,000 in charity and increase awareness for the many difficulties we face and have personal attachments to over the next year. Going forward, we hope to inspire a movement of like-minded self empowered people and take our mission to even greater heights.



20% Straight to Charity
We paired each shirt with a charity that we felt aligned with the tee's concept and cause.  Many causes already have an established color, so we did our best to align the cause's color with our virtues and available color-ways. 
For every sale, we’ll donate 20% straight to that cause. Check out the charity breakdown:




Our Vision and GrowthSelftees is about the people, and this journey starts with YOU. That's why, over the next 12 months, we are asking you to join us on a mission to raise $200,000 for our selected charities.  


We believe Selftees will be an excellent promoter of awareness for many causes moving forward. We will be there supporting our communities, partnering with local organizations, and doing what we can the best way we know how.


Join The Selfteem!
When our website launches on November 21, every contributor of our campaign will gain access to our exclusive member's area. When you grab your first Selftee, you're already a part of the Selfteem!
Hook 5 friends up with a 10% discount on their first purchase, and you will earn a free Selftee for yourself.
In the member's area of our new website, you'll be able to:


Learn how to earn 20% off your next purchase for every new friend who uses your code (They get a nice 10% discount too!).
If you've got enough credit, you can even redeem your Selftee for free!
Send a friend a Selftee.
Or, just have us donate the money to any of our selected charities!

<h2>The Pregancy Seat Belt System</h2>
<p>The vehicle safety belt as we know it today, was first patented in 1955. Since then, there has been little change as far as fit and comfort, and there have been no improvements to accommodate a pregnant woman and her growing fetus. Recent changes in family lifestyles have led to a significant increase in the number of miles that mothers drive daily. As a result, maternal and fetal injuries from car accidents are on the rise.</p>
</div>
<p><br/>Car accidents are the leading cause of trauma related maternal and fetal death, killing on average more than one fetus each day.  To illustrate just how delicate a growing baby is, a fetus is 15 times more likely to die from a car crash, than a person up to 14 years old with a gunshot wound. Most significant injuries to a pregnant mother occur as a result of intense lap belt loading forces against the abdomen in a crash. The Pregnancy Seat Belt® is an innovative design that completely eliminates the dangerous lap belt. Instead, it holds the thighs and pelvis firmly in place. The result is no additional forces to the abdomen, eliminating lap belt loading. Also, a double ""cross your heart"" belt system minimizes chest wall trauma by holding the mother's upperbody firmly in place.</p>
<p><br/>A need for a product of this type was first recognized by co-founder Pete Calderon Jr. who, as a first responder and transportation specialist, personally witnessed severe injury and death to young mothers and their growing child within. Richard D. Fan, a trauma specialist working in a busy southern CA emergency department also recognized the lack of a safe and practical vehicle primary restraint system for pregnant women. The two men shared stories and ideas and took action to develop the Pregnancy Seat Belt®.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Need for a Product of This Type</strong></h2>
<p>There are approximately 6 million pregnancies in the U.S. per year in which 170,000 pregnant women are involved in a traffic collision. Of those, up to 1000 fetuses will die as a result of injuries to the mother, according to the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Injury Research and Control (CIRCL). Additionally, automobile accidents are the single largest cause of accidental death in pregnant woment. More pregnant women die from car crashes than any other kind of pregnancy complication</p>
<p>What causes maternal and fetal injury in car crashes? The answer lies in blunt force trauma during impact caused the steering wheel and intense seat belt forces against the abdomen, causing tearing or separation of the placenta. Placenta abrupto, causes loss of blood flow and oxygen to the baby, and eventually fetal demise. Other severe injuries can also occur such as massive tearing of organs and abdominal wall and rupture of the bladder.</p>
<p>Over the years, education and aggressive law enforcement has improved seatbelt compliance for drivers, however “proper” wearing of seatbelts, specifically the placement of the lap belt continues to be a problem. Pregnant and obese drivers often complain of poor and uncomfortable fit and of lap belts across the waist. Additionally, lap belts often spontaneous creep up to the abdomen instead of staying in the proper position across the hips, putting both fetus and vital organs in danger of traumatic forces.</p>
<p>Recently, fetal rights and therefore “fetal right to sue for wrongful death” is becoming more commonplace. Courts are increasingly allowing the surviving family to sue on behalf of the fetus during motor vehicle accidents citing that the unborn child is indeed a passenger in the car and should carry the same rights as any other passenger. A few examples of this evolving trend can be seen in the following examples:<br/>2010 Wisconsin 4th District Court of Appeals Shannon Tesar vs. American Family Mutual Insurance Company<br/>2011 Alabama Supreme Court: Mack vs. Carmak <br/>2012 Senate Bill 674 signed by Governor Bob McDonnell that approves tort cause of action in Virginia for the wrongful death of an unborn child <br/>2/3 of states have adopted statutory and case law allowing cause of action for wrongful death of the unborn child. <br/>A seatbelt system designed for pregnant women can significantly reduce the liability of insurance companies, automakers, and many more potential defendants. While data for the exact amounts of losses due to claims and court settlements in this arena is poorly tracked, estimates of savings from claims and damages could be in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>What is the solution to the problem of standard equipment seat belts used by auto manufacturers today?</p>
<h2>
<strong>Solution: The Pregnancy Seat Belt</strong> </h2>
<p>The Pregnancy Seat Belt system is a patent pending device that completely eliminates the lap belt. This eliminates the dangerous compressive forces against the placenta, bladder and gastrointestinal organs. The system features a double cross chest restraint to protect the upper body and double thigh and perineal strap to secure the pelvic girdle in the event of a collision. Best of all, this unique system is designed to retrofit into all automobiles in regular production today.</p>
<p>The Pregnancy Seat Belt is constructed of DOT approved seat belt webbing rated at 5000 pounds shear strength, and industry proven rated standard seat belt buckles.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Existing Competition</strong><br/>The Tummy Shield, an Australian product consisting of a seat cushion with thigh straps that attach between the legs with a stainless steel hook.</p>
<p>Pixie Safety Harness: An England based product consisting of a four point harness that secures the shoulders and chest. You must still use the car’s existing lap belt across the waist. This system does not eliminate the abdominal and fetal load on impact.</p>
<p>There are a few other insignificant seat belt modifiers that reposition the OEM shoulder harness for driver comfort. None of these models eliminate the problem of lap belt loading forces.</p>

<h2><strong>Summary Description of Business</strong></h2>
<p>There is no known successful widely used product of this type on the market today of this type and both the maternity and automotive industries are wide open for an introduction of the Pregnancy Seat Belt®. The Pregnancy Seat Belt® is designed as a retrofit device and is adaptable to most cars, and can be used for drivers and front passengers. Furthermore, this product can be used for protection of the obese vehicle occupant.</p>
<p>CalFanCo has designed and tested 5 variations of the Pregnancy Seat Belt. The final prototype is now in ready for crash testing and a patent pending status has been achievd with Patel and Alumit LLC.  All designs are currently registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and have achieved patent pending status. The final testing of the Pregnancy Seat Belt® is scheduled at this time and the short-term goals of the company are to test the product with an independent government approved crash test facility (Karco in Adelanto,CA). We will then produce the first run of successful Pregnancy Seat Belts® and then license the product to major auto manufacturers and auto accessory manufacturers. The long-term objectives of the company are to dominate the industry in this niche, building a reputation for saving lives and becoming the new standard in vehicle safety for pregnant women. Our continuing long term goal includes point of purchases sales in department and specialty stores, and to continue the development of this product for use by vehicle occupants sitting in any seat of a vehicle.</p>
<p>CalFanCo has already engaged in talks with leading auto manufacturers, including Honda Motors of America, Ford Motor Company, and Volvo. Specifically we have been discussing the development of our product with the safety and research and development teams. There are no solid commitments as of yet, as our product is not yet finished. However, interest is very high including very promising discussions with Laura Kvarnstrand of Volvo, a pioneer in crash safety during pregnancy and developer of the first computer 3D simulated crash test dummy.</p>
<p>With the competition in the automotive industry today, each auto manufacturer is looking for a innovation that will put them ahead of the pack, in terms of value, innovation, and crash safety.</p>
<p>We need your support</p>
<p>Ultimately, we would like to license this product for use by major auto manufacturers. Alternatively, a corporation with major funding may choose to acquire and further develop this unique product.  Either way, we want to make this product available to ""moms to be"" all over the world.   Please help us save a life and thanks for your support!</p>

<p><strong>Wallets that are smart are on the rise</strong> - they make life easier and protect some of your most important and private information. On Kickstarter there has been countless wallet options introduced to the market. Wallets do have one major issue though:</p>
<p>they're not <strong>YOUR</strong> wallet. You've got a wallet - maybe one you've had for years. It's the right size, it's the right look, you'll never use anything else. LEIF is the solution. LEIF looks like every other card you carry - but it turns your wallet smart. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475722590/p7vfkl4kqyyhojvuhuru.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>LEIF is incredibly thin</strong> - that means no added bulge to your favorite wallet. Other devices you could use are too thick, and only track. LEIF is undetectable in your wallet, and does so much more. Custom Radius Tracking, Pick-Pocket Theft Alerts, and amazing Pin-Dropping Smart dial recovery. See the details of each specific feature below. </p>
<p><strong>1) C U S T O M   R A D I U S   T R A C K I N G</strong></p>
<p><strong>LEIF is ridiculously smart</strong>. Most tracking devices are too attentive at all the wrong times. You might walk to the bathroom, and all the sudden your phone buzzes, telling you you've left something behind, but really it's sitting safely in your kitchen. </p>
<p><strong>LEIF's custom radius tracking</strong> allows you to drop pins and set custom ""safe zones"" like your Home, where you don't get buzzed by a wallet simply left on the other side of the house. Drop a pin on your map, then drag the radius to your desired distance. It's that simple. Need to find your wallet in that radius? It's simple - hit find, then the LEIF app counts down the feet till your wallet is secure. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475722641/i7rn3u0gljz9vhjmjeso.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>2)  P I C K - P O C K E T   T H E F T   A L E R T S</strong></p>
<p><strong>When you're away from</strong> your set Home radius, you're protected. Have your wallet snatched from you or leave it behind at a table? LEIF knows when you and your wallet are separated. Get further than 30 feet apart (default distance) and the LEIF app will let you know. </p>
<p><strong>Retrace your steps</strong>, or follow your suspect thief, and LEIF will notify you when your wallet is back in range. Once in range, click find, and the LEIF app will count down the feet until your wallet it secure. Thieves beware, LEIF will find you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475722708/y8ykd72bhgjpy69dufpg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>3) P I N   D R O P   S M A R T   D I A L   R E C O V E R Y</strong></p>
<p><strong>What happens if</strong> you don't notice the early warning? Maybe LEIF tells you your wallet is out of range, but you didn't hear the warning chime. Don't worry - LEIF has the solution there too. </p>
<p><strong>After the early warning</strong> theft/leave behind notification, LEIF does you an amazing favor: it drops a pin at the exact location of your wallet, then harnesses the power of google maps to pull the information of the store/restaurant/event center at which you left your wallet. Up to your screen is pulled the phone number of said location, so you can quickly call them and let them know you're on you're way to pick it up. </p>
<p>Maybe we haven't said it enough: <strong>LEIF is incredibly smart</strong>.</p>

<p>Bend &amp; Flex Tech makes it nearly indestructible </p>
<p>Our unique bend &amp; flex tech means you'll never have to worry about sitting on your wallet. This truly is a smart device unlike any other - thin &amp; flexible so it works WITH you rather than you having to make it work with your setup.</p>

</div></div>","Wallets that are smart are on the rise - they make life easier and protect some of your most important and private information. On Kickstarter there has been countless wallet options introduced to the market. Wallets do have one major issue though:
they're not YOUR wallet. You've got a wallet - maybe one you've had for years. It's the right size, it's the right look, you'll never use anything else. LEIF is the solution. LEIF looks like every other card you carry - but it turns your wallet smart. 

LEIF is incredibly thin - that means no added bulge to your favorite wallet. Other devices you could use are too thick, and only track. LEIF is undetectable in your wallet, and does so much more. Custom Radius Tracking, Pick-Pocket Theft Alerts, and amazing Pin-Dropping Smart dial recovery. See the details of each specific feature below. 
1) C U S T O M   R A D I U S   T R A C K I N G
LEIF is ridiculously smart. Most tracking devices are too attentive at all the wrong times. You might walk to the bathroom, and all the sudden your phone buzzes, telling you you've left something behind, but really it's sitting safely in your kitchen. 
LEIF's custom radius tracking allows you to drop pins and set custom ""safe zones"" like your Home, where you don't get buzzed by a wallet simply left on the other side of the house. Drop a pin on your map, then drag the radius to your desired distance. It's that simple. Need to find your wallet in that radius? It's simple - hit find, then the LEIF app counts down the feet till your wallet is secure. 

2)  P I C K - P O C K E T   T H E F T   A L E R T S
When you're away from your set Home radius, you're protected. Have your wallet snatched from you or leave it behind at a table? LEIF knows when you and your wallet are separated. Get further than 30 feet apart (default distance) and the LEIF app will let you know. 
Retrace your steps, or follow your suspect thief, and LEIF will notify you when your wallet is back in range. Once in range, click find, and the LEIF app will count down the feet until your wallet it secure. Thieves beware, LEIF will find you. 

3) P I N   D R O P   S M A R T   D I A L   R E C O V E R Y
What happens if you don't notice the early warning? Maybe LEIF tells you your wallet is out of range, but you didn't hear the warning chime. Don't worry - LEIF has the solution there too. 
After the early warning theft/leave behind notification, LEIF does you an amazing favor: it drops a pin at the exact location of your wallet, then harnesses the power of google maps to pull the information of the store/restaurant/event center at which you left your wallet. Up to your screen is pulled the phone number of said location, so you can quickly call them and let them know you're on you're way to pick it up. 
Maybe we haven't said it enough: LEIF is incredibly smart.

Below is a shot of the LEIF home screen. Adjust your setting by tapping the menu button, see how far you are from your wallet using the central distance meter, or find your LEIF using the map function. 

S P E C I F I C A T I O N S

The LEIF is smart, but simple. Here's a few technical specs you need to know:
Dimensions: 85.60 × 53.98 mm (standard credit card size)
2 mm Thin (about 2x standard credit card thickness)
Bluetooth: CSR 4.2
Range: Up to 100 FT
Battery Life: 1 Year
Bend & Flex Tech makes it nearly indestructible 
Our unique bend & flex tech means you'll never have to worry about sitting on your wallet. This truly is a smart device unlike any other - thin & flexible so it works WITH you rather than you having to make it work with your setup.
R E W A R D   L E V E L S
There's really only one reward, and it's well worth the wait. Coming from our last Kickstarter? There's a unique reward level just for you. Looking for a LEIF for you and a friend? We've got you covered with our multi-pack reward levels. See all the offered level on the right, or below.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Allison, and I am the founder and formulator at Rogue Republic Cosmetics. We were conceived in winter 2012, founding in May and finally launching the line in July. We are committed to the mission of creating mineral-based VEGAN cosmetics that keep sensitive skin in mind and can withstand demanding, active lifestyles. Our final product has been compared by some of our customers, makeup artists and everyday women alike, to companies like MAC and Bare Escentuals for their color payoff, blendability, and staying power.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why IndieGoGo if we're so great?</h3>
<p>But we <strong>need your help</strong> to grow. Our line consists of loose powder pigments, at present. We are now working on offering palettes of pressed shadow in coordinated colors, lip glosses, powder foundation and concealer, and lipstick palette/samplers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a lot of waste in the formulating process. Ingredients are wasted, packaging is ruined and becomes not reusable...the costs add up before the successul product is complete and ready for testing and going to market. We currently have 6 shades we're waiting to release due to this exact issue and the need to purchase enough ingredients to stock the products in our store.</p>
<p>You contribution will allow us to help you feel your best when you use Rogue Republic products. <strong>We will not release products we cannot stand behind</strong>, which is why our formulating can become a rigorous testing ground for each potential product, and much doesn't make the cut. By participating in our indiegogo campaign you are doing more than simply trying out our products or decorating your home with our art--you are joining a beauty movement and helping me fulfill my dream in a way that is sustainable for the business in the long run.</p>
<p>YOU are becoming an investor. You are the shark tank, and you are the partners we are looking for to expand our cruelty-free, beautiful empire.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise the operational expenses needed to expand our line at the most basic, early stage: our cosmetic kitchen.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need at least $300 for raw ingredients. Many ingredients we try to incorporate don't make the cut and that's what can lead to waste. But we need to try all our options in these formulas to get the best, vegan makeup that is as gentle as possible on your skin while still matching up to our existing line.</li>
<li>Additional funds around $200 are needed for packaging these products, and more beyond that for marketing these new additions. We have been featured in The Petite Alternative for our products and have an ad coming out in Filigree Magazine next quarter--but this is only the beginning.</li>
<li>Our perks range from ways you can test out our products yourself, to original art you can get to customize your home, office, lair, etc. <strong>We are even making a loose pigment that is exclusive to this IndieGoGo campaign</strong>'s perk. You can even get customized packages of products for your skin tone, eye color, and hair color!</li>
</ul>
<p>We will of course incur other costs as we grow, such as registering as an LLC and organizing photo shoots to improve our store with more true-to-life images of our pigments. Rest assured every penny raised will be more than appreciated; it will be put to WORK. Whether it's in spreading our message and word of our company, or in creating our next round of new products, it will be used to the fullest to make this company become what I know it can be!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Rogue Republic aims to be the high-end, eco-conscious cosmetics company you dream of at a budget that doesn't break your wallet, and with a mission that doesn't irk your conscience. Our target audience is those men and women in alternative subcultures who seen long lasting, bold makeup that stands up to stage lights, long photo shoots, and all nighters at the club--without sacrificing sensitive skin or resorting to animal cruelty for our own gain.We never test on animals and neither do our suppliers. We are 100% transparent about what goes into our products, and no formulas include any animal products or byproducts. Cruelty-free, gentle, vegan, beautiful.</p>
<p>This is our first go at gaining investors and seeking your help. We already have <strong>a lot of people who believe in us</strong>, such as the beautiful women (inside and out) at MediaVault/The Petite Alternative and in our adopted Philly home. These are people who HAVE tried our products and truly think it is everything we taut it to be. But what we need now is to grow; to grow we need investors who also believe in what we are doing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Right now this is a one-woman operation. It's me, Allison Gretsuk. I am a woman who works full time during the day, am a fine artist and artisan by night, and spend every other waking hour at this dream, despite many chronic health problems which I am bound and determined to shove out of my way. We want to grow and absorb the cost of hiring employees and gaining a team of experienced make up artists, advisors, and friends. We want to be your beauty community, whether you're in an alternative scene or not. Our customers so far span gender, age group, occupation, and lifestyle, which is something I never expected as an indie alternative company, and it always puts a smile on my face.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a mother of a 2 year old I have been very frustrated with the common onesie. There is no way to check my son's diaper without undressing him or trying to peek through the leg of the diaper which can leave your finger a little messy. So I designed the Peek-a-poo onesie to solve this problem! This onesie has a unique design which allows the caregiver the ability to peek into the top of the diaper without taking off shoes, pants or unsnapping the onesie.</p>
<p>I've been working on this design for a year now and it is finally ready for manufacturing!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What your money is going toward... Your pledge will help me purchase my first bulk order of Peek-a-poo onesies! I can offer two sizes 3-6 month and 6-12 month. They will both be in classic white.</p>
<p>Once fully funded I will be able to add more colors, designs, and sizes to the Peek-a-poo collection. These will then be available for future purchase on my website.</p>
<p>The Peek-a-poo pictured is my sample design. The onesies available will be in classic white</p>

I am Francis, owner of a small watch brand called Tangramatic based in Sydney. Back in 2014 I bought a watch to commemorate my stay in Australia which eventually got me into watch designing and engineering. Truly, one of those moments when you found something you really love doing.

Introducing the Nereid
After our second model the 39a, we felt that offering a new, clean, and creative design would get people to discover or even renew their love for watches.
The result of that concept is the Nereid, based from the original marine watches used by sailors to navigate the seas long before GPS was invented.


Today, we all live in the age of smart devices. But one thing's for sure, there is still appreciation for the beauty of craftsmanship.

<h2><strong>The Story</strong></h2>
<p>Growing up neighbors and competing against each other in sports, we have been best friends since we can remember.  After going our own ways following high school (Kramer currently attends University of California Santa Barbara and Kevin is at The University of Oregon) and learning what we have in school, we have worked diligently the past six months designing this great wallet.  We took all the great features of wallets and money clips and put them into one affordable, stylish,and sleek leather design.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1285.photobucket.com/albums/a585/Kramer_Kevin/0fd6404c-445b-44d9-a0e4-8b3f83fe8ccb_zps1c94b631.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p>

<h1>Pure Convenience-Patent Pending</h1>
<p>We got annoyed with pulling the same card in and out of our wallets several times a day. During the week we use our debit cards, while on the weekends we mostly use our ID. With this in mind, we integrated a pocket on the back of the wallet which allows the user to easily access their most used card. With the finger slide feature, you can either slide the card out halfway to swipe it, or conveniently remove and replace the card without ever having to open the wallet. You won't want to go back to a conventional wallet after using this feature...we promise. </p>

<h1>The Perfect Wallet</h1>
<p>In search for a sleek, stylish and affordable wallet, all we could find were money clips and credit card holders.  These worked great for holding your cards, but folding and unfolding your cash wasn't efficient and added bulk.  We also explored the option of high-end designer brands due to their great quality, however couldn't rationalize paying $200 for a wallet.  The idea with Articulate Wallets is to cut out the brand inflation of designer wallets, and to offer a high- quality, genuine leather wallet that looks great and does everything you need it too do--all at an affordable price.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1285.photobucket.com/albums/a585/Kramer_Kevin/d94335cd-1f35-44d6-82ae-98ad3ccb993c_zps8354c1e0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1>We wanted a wallet that:</h1>
<ul>
<li>is lightweight</li>
<li>is low profile</li>
<li>is designed simplistically</li>
<li>is stylish</li>
<li>is affordable</li>
<li>is high quality</li>
<li>Allows easy access to your cards and cash</li>
<li>Isn't limited to a fixed number of cards you can carry</li>
<li>Allows you to slide out a card and never have to take it out</li>
<li>Can be fully customized to fit the user, not the user fitting the wallet</li>
</ul><h1>The Design</h1>
<p>The Articulate Wallet combines genuine leather with a beautiful design that looks great in his or her pocket. We were tired of cheap fake leather or velcro wallets that we see everywhere. We wanted a wallet that we would be proud to show off to our friends. This is why we came up with the Articulate Wallet.</p>

<p> </p>
<h1>Unique X design</h1>
<p>In order to keep the wallet lightweight, low-profile and simple, we needed to minimize the amount of leather used.  Using an X elastic design, we eliminated unnecessary pockets, making your cards easy to store and easily accessible.</p>

<h1>Manufacturing</h1>
<p>Articulate Wallets are made from 100% Genuine Leather along with a high quality, durable elastic material.  We reviewed several different manufacturers until we found one that produces at a very high quality and  timely fashion.  We have the packaging material designed and ready to go. Now, with your help we can get out the first production run of  Articulate Wallets!  <strong>Your pledge will go directly into the production and final assembly costs of the wallets,  allowing us to meet the minimum order quantity</strong>. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the wallet, or would like to give some feedback, we would love to hear it.  Your support is greatly appreciated!!</p>

<span>Risks and challenges</span> </h2>
<p>The challenges of Articulate Wallets will be getting the word out, and convincing backers to participate. With so many great projects to choose from, we hope ours will stand apart from the rest. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help spread the word.</p>
<p>Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a manufacturer for months and have established a solid relationship, which has has given us a lot of confidence in them.</p>

Growing up neighbors and competing against each other in sports, we have been best friends since we can remember.  After going our own ways following high school (Kramer currently attends University of California Santa Barbara and Kevin is at The University of Oregon) and learning what we have in school, we have worked diligently the past six months designing this great wallet.  We took all the great features of wallets and money clips and put them into one affordable, stylish,and sleek leather design.
 

 

Pure Convenience-Patent Pending
We got annoyed with pulling the same card in and out of our wallets several times a day. During the week we use our debit cards, while on the weekends we mostly use our ID. With this in mind, we integrated a pocket on the back of the wallet which allows the user to easily access their most used card. With the finger slide feature, you can either slide the card out halfway to swipe it, or conveniently remove and replace the card without ever having to open the wallet. You won't want to go back to a conventional wallet after using this feature...we promise. 



The Perfect Wallet
In search for a sleek, stylish and affordable wallet, all we could find were money clips and credit card holders.  These worked great for holding your cards, but folding and unfolding your cash wasn't efficient and added bulk.  We also explored the option of high-end designer brands due to their great quality, however couldn't rationalize paying $200 for a wallet.  The idea with Articulate Wallets is to cut out the brand inflation of designer wallets, and to offer a high- quality, genuine leather wallet that looks great and does everything you need it too do--all at an affordable price.


We wanted a wallet that:

is lightweight
is low profile
is designed simplistically
is stylish
is affordable
is high quality
Allows easy access to your cards and cash
Isn't limited to a fixed number of cards you can carry
Allows you to slide out a card and never have to take it out
Can be fully customized to fit the user, not the user fitting the wallet
The Design
The Articulate Wallet combines genuine leather with a beautiful design that looks great in his or her pocket. We were tired of cheap fake leather or velcro wallets that we see everywhere. We wanted a wallet that we would be proud to show off to our friends. This is why we came up with the Articulate Wallet.



 
Unique X design
In order to keep the wallet lightweight, low-profile and simple, we needed to minimize the amount of leather used.  Using an X elastic design, we eliminated unnecessary pockets, making your cards easy to store and easily accessible.

Manufacturing
Articulate Wallets are made from 100% Genuine Leather along with a high quality, durable elastic material.  We reviewed several different manufacturers until we found one that produces at a very high quality and  timely fashion.  We have the packaging material designed and ready to go. Now, with your help we can get out the first production run of  Articulate Wallets!  Your pledge will go directly into the production and final assembly costs of the wallets,  allowing us to meet the minimum order quantity. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the wallet, or would like to give some feedback, we would love to hear it.  Your support is greatly appreciated!!

Risks and challenges 
The challenges of Articulate Wallets will be getting the word out, and convincing backers to participate. With so many great projects to choose from, we hope ours will stand apart from the rest. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help spread the word.
Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a manufacturer for months and have established a solid relationship, which has has given us a lot of confidence in them.",28.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p>Do you really know if motorists can actually see you at night while you are biking, walking or jogging? A lot of sport apparels have reflective tape but is it really good enough? Reflective tape works by reflecting light back to the original light source only. Therefore, a car’s headlight can only see you if you are in line with the headlight. Why wait for motorist to see you? With Badger 360°, you will be visible from all directions!</p>

<h1><strong>Prototype Stage:</strong></h1>
<p>During the prototype stage of development, we had to figure out the best way to route the LED strings.  We made our first prototype and went to more than 40 bikes shops and running stores around Los Angeles to ask for their comments and suggestions.  We were glad that we did that because we realized the jacket was lacking lots of key features.</p>

<p>Soft Production:  Rather making thousands of jackets at one time.  We are going to have a soft production run of 500 units.  That way, we can adjust the assembly line if necessary.  Also, we can make sure those 500 units are meeting our standards. </p>
<p>Hard Production: Once the 500 units have been tested and passed our inspection, we will continue to make the rest of the units. </p>
<p>Communication: Communication with our manufacturer will be extremely important. We have been working with our manufacturers for more than 12 months now and it has been running pretty smoothly.  We will work hard and continue our effort until the merchandise are ready to ship. </p>

<div>My story begins 22 years ago at 22 years old.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That is when I first taught myself to make a hat.  My determination and love for hat making has been ongoing since.  I took on having a shop one year into starting to design.  At the time I was very green in the profession, however, I have incredibly strong natural business skills and still to this day, I have people complementing me on hats they bought 20 yrs. ago!  As well, jump ahead two decades and I am now fully skilled and absolutely ready to launch!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have continued to make hats, stock small boutiques here and there, launch collections at craft fairs and on line via Facebook and my website: <a href=""http://www.katherinecarey.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.katherinecarey.com</a>.  HOWEVER, I seem to still be stuck in the phase of not being able to grow due to seed money.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sure I can make a hat out of practically nothing.  I am actually excellent at that.  But for my business to launch to a level where it is a label globally known for quality and creativity (the actual goal), it requires a different level of design.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I started out creating originals and now I create lines.  Of course there are always originals popping out, but for the larger markets, a consistent line is required and desired.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Millinery tools and materials are not inexpensive.  Hence why handmade quality hats can cost so much.  A savvy shopper I truly am!  Not frivolous or complacent.  I am excellent at stretching my dollars!  And now that I live in New York City, I have access to an abundance of resources to create beautiful consistent hats at the best price points available.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So where do I need help?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, this 22 year journey has taken me from Los Angeles to Maui to New York... all the while I have done my most diligent to maintain and sustain my business and my life.   Sometimes more successfully then other times.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am not what a bank views as a perfect client for a business loan due to my artist living/hand to mouth existence. I have hit a block.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I can not continue to launch to the level I inspire to with the level of support I currently have.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I need to raise funds!!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>How will they be used:</div>
<div>Equipment!  Proper millinery equipment.  A real hat sewing machine instead of an inexpensive house machine.  A set of real hat blocks instead of blocking from plastic hat inserts and dishes, bowls, and always make-shifting my tools.  A real studio space where I can grow my dream properly instead of squeezing my dream down to the size of the work space.  All time saving needs for a more productive business.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With these needs met, this would open up the opportunity to be able to commit to a very large wholesale order that can sustain my business allowing me the ability to purchase the materials needed until I am paid for the work.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's really the only way I can grow to the next level.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>How I look forward to hiring staff that can grow with me while I help to sustain their lifestyles.  That part comes next.  But what I see launching ALL of this is landing a large order that can give my business a boost to maintain itself.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My goal is reasonable.  We all know that business start ups actually require more.  But with $8000, I can truly get the business to a level to launch itself.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>No matter what I will continue to grow...but I so appreciate the nutrients!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My gratitude is overwhelming.  I know we all have places we want to see our hard earned money go.  I thank you for taking the time to read this and for considering participating in the continuation of a life long dream to be an entrepreneur creatively growing my business.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sharing helps so much too!</div>

<div>I thank you for considering sharing my campaign.  The way to reach my goal is to get as many people to my campaign as possible.</div>

<div>p.s.  Today's launching of this campaign is a classic example as to WHY I truly need funding.  With the computer broken <span>every bit of this has been done via iPhone.  What should have taken a couple hours has sucked up an entire day.  My hat production is the same way.  What should be efficient isn't, making each hat takes so much longer than it should.</span>
<div> </div>
<div>I just about didn't launch this campaign today.  The frustration level of working on equipment not equipped to do the job just about got to me, however, just like with my business...I prevail.</div>

<h3>ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW:</h3>
<h3>Hello, my name is Unique Weston. I founded Monroe Threadz at the age of 20yrs old. Growing up as an orphan without a lot of belongings or resources I fell in love with fashion design. All I wanted to do was design beautiful clothes since I was never fortunate enough to own beautiful attire myself. Being a foster child hindered my ability to dream, because at times I felt that I didn't know where I belonged and I didn't know where to begin.</h3>
<h3>    I was inspired to pursue my dream of becoming a fashion designer by Marilyn Monroe, a 1950's Model and Movie icon. After reading her biography, I learned that Marilyn had also grown up as an orphan, but still managed to accomplish her goals as an actress without parents, or her family's financial support. I  was motivated to do the same with my big dreams as well. At the age of 18,After being lost for many years, I let go of my insecurities and began making my dreams reality. I began hand-sewing dresses and modeling them in front of a camera. Like Marilyn, my modeling skills took off like a rocket. A year later, the fashion line Monroe Threadz was born; the combination of Marilyn MONROE and Unique's passion for fashion; THREADZ.</h3>
<h3>This is not just another fashion line. It holds a very valuable meaning and message. Monroe Threadz is dedicated to all the girls and boys around the world who have dreamed, believed and perceived their own greatness. For the girls and boys who have dreams that feel unreachable, the purpose of my clothing line is to inspire them to pursue their dreams no matter what they look like, how old they are, or what their current living situation may be. I believe everyone was born with a God given talent and it's our job to live out our dreams for the future! I can not express enough how much any contribution you make will help me achieve my goal of being a successful Fashion Designer, tell my story, and make history.</h3>
<h3>WHAT M.T. NEEDS &amp; WHAT YOU GET:</h3>
<h3>I took a huge leap of faith and moved from my Mountain top hometown of Denver, Colorado all the way to the Pacific coast of Los Angeles, California with NOTHING but my supportive boyfriend, sewing machine, designs, and faith in my dream. As we all know running your own business is difficult, but starting from the bottom in a new city makes the journey that much more Challenging. The first half of the money Monroe Threadz raises will go towards acquiring a company car, setting up an online boutique, an industrial serger machine, and assembling a new Monroe Team. The second half will be used to pay showroom fees for my Spring 2013 Collection, samples, and production. With the capital that I have already contributed and the money I will raise with your help, I will be able to put together a wonderful California collection that will help Monroe Threadz get off the ground and into closets around the world! Growing up in foster care has taught me that giving is more important than receiving. so to show my gratitude I have many perks to offer. Monroe Threadz T-Shirts, Monroe Threadz swimsuits, Monroe Threadz stickers, shout-outs, an invitation to Spring fashion show, and 2 pieces from my new collection.</h3>
<h3>SUCCESS IS AROUND THE CORNER:</h3>
<h3>
<strong>Modeling and designing in denver brought lots of success. Not only have I taken thousands of photos and attended 100's of fashion shows, I've given various women and men (age 2- 42) the confidence, and inspiration, to follow their dreams. I've taught many girls how to model and motivated designers to continue to pursue their dreams. I know that if Monroe Threadz can generate the funds it needs; it will continue to touch people's lives in a way that a fashion line has never done!</strong><br/>Thoughts become things and if you can believe it, you can most certainly achieve it! I know Monroe Threadz will be a success. Im hoping you believe as well!</h3>
<h3>THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH:</h3>
<h3>I know a lot of us are struggling to make ends meet these days, so I understand if you can't necessarily contribute money. But that doesn't mean that you can't help me succeed.

    I was inspired to pursue my dream of becoming a fashion designer by Marilyn Monroe, a 1950's Model and Movie icon. After reading her biography, I learned that Marilyn had also grown up as an orphan, but still managed to accomplish her goals as an actress without parents, or her family's financial support. I  was motivated to do the same with my big dreams as well. At the age of 18,After being lost for many years, I let go of my insecurities and began making my dreams reality. I began hand-sewing dresses and modeling them in front of a camera. Like Marilyn, my modeling skills took off like a rocket. A year later, the fashion line Monroe Threadz was born; the combination of Marilyn MONROE and Unique's passion for fashion; THREADZ.
This is not just another fashion line. It holds a very valuable meaning and message. Monroe Threadz is dedicated to all the girls and boys around the world who have dreamed, believed and perceived their own greatness. For the girls and boys who have dreams that feel unreachable, the purpose of my clothing line is to inspire them to pursue their dreams no matter what they look like, how old they are, or what their current living situation may be. I believe everyone was born with a God given talent and it's our job to live out our dreams for the future! I can not express enough how much any contribution you make will help me achieve my goal of being a successful Fashion Designer, tell my story, and make history.
WHAT M.T. NEEDS & WHAT YOU GET:
I took a huge leap of faith and moved from my Mountain top hometown of Denver, Colorado all the way to the Pacific coast of Los Angeles, California with NOTHING but my supportive boyfriend, sewing machine, designs, and faith in my dream. As we all know running your own business is difficult, but starting from the bottom in a new city makes the journey that much more Challenging. The first half of the money Monroe Threadz raises will go towards acquiring a company car, setting up an online boutique, an industrial serger machine, and assembling a new Monroe Team. The second half will be used to pay showroom fees for my Spring 2013 Collection, samples, and production. With the capital that I have already contributed and the money I will raise with your help, I will be able to put together a wonderful California collection that will help Monroe Threadz get off the ground and into closets around the world! Growing up in foster care has taught me that giving is more important than receiving. so to show my gratitude I have many perks to offer. Monroe Threadz T-Shirts, Monroe Threadz swimsuits, Monroe Threadz stickers, shout-outs, an invitation to Spring fashion show, and 2 pieces from my new collection.
SUCCESS IS AROUND THE CORNER:

Modeling and designing in denver brought lots of success. Not only have I taken thousands of photos and attended 100's of fashion shows, I've given various women and men (age 2- 42) the confidence, and inspiration, to follow their dreams. I've taught many girls how to model and motivated designers to continue to pursue their dreams. I know that if Monroe Threadz can generate the funds it needs; it will continue to touch people's lives in a way that a fashion line has never done!Thoughts become things and if you can believe it, you can most certainly achieve it! I know Monroe Threadz will be a success. Im hoping you believe as well!
THANK YOU EVER SO MUCH:
I know a lot of us are struggling to make ends meet these days, so I understand if you can't necessarily contribute money. But that doesn't mean that you can't help me succeed.

<em>Who Are We?</em> | <strong>FUTR Footwear</strong>
</h1>
<p>FUTR Footwear is a company started by 2 college students, in Los Angeles CA, that have a passion for success and a love for fashion. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/536/108/fe80b2e575868dccb77b487e88392fbf_large.png?1366700972"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>The Philosophy </strong></p>
<p>It is natural then, that the philosophy of FUTR Footwear is to provide shoes that are both fashionable and compliment the lifestyle of young people striving to succeed.</p>
<p>The goal of FUTR Footwear is, for all products that bear its name, to make the person wearing them feel like success is nothing but guaranteed for them on the road ahead.  </p>
<p>Simply put, FUTR Footwear is the story of a person that <strong><em>will</em> </strong>make it. </p>
<p><strong>Let's Meet the Makers</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Andre Marcarian </em>| </strong>Founder and CEO</p>
<p>The idea for FUTR Footwear was initially drafted up by Andre Marcarian. Before deciding to start FUTR Footwear, Andre was pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Business and Finance, working in downtown Los Angeles. Some people would already find that a busy enough schedule, but Andre felt that he still was not putting, what little was left of, his free time into something meaningful. And so, FUTR Footwear was thought of by Andre to make shoes that support, embrace, and compliment his lifestyle and the lifestyle of other driven individuals like him.</p>
<p><strong><em>Armand Gharakhani </em>|</strong> Head Designer and Consultant on Fashion Industry</p>
<p>After the concept of FUTR Footwear was completed, Andre needed a designer and partner. Of course this person had to not only be a good designer but also had to befit the FUTR Footwear culture of young success driven individuals. The perfect candidate came when Andre met Armand Gharakhani. Armand has been working for his parents' high fashion clothing company for years and is also in school pursuing a Bachelor's in Vehicle Design. </p>
<h1>
<em>What Have We Done?(so far)</em> | DayDreams</h1>
<p>The First step taken to initiate the vision for FUTR Footwear was designing the very first shoe. Easy right? Sure! All that was needed was to draft a design, find a designer, find a manufacturer, drink coffee...lots of coffee, order a sample, network, and tell the world.  </p>
<p><strong>Let's Meet the ""DayDreams"" </strong></p>
<p>The first model designed by FUTR Footwear is the DayDreams. The name DayDreams is an homage to all the young people out there that begin their plan for success with a simple DayDream. </p>
<p>And so for FUTR Footwear, the DayDreams are the first step in their plan. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/513/578/a3e20ab778faaaccadf40ccdd623db29_large.jpg?1365905218"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Creative Process</strong></p>
<p>The creative process that went into designing the DayDreams started form the humble beginnings on notepads, when Andre was looking for a way to express the FutrFootwear culture he imagined, with a breakthrough shoe that could compliment the lifestyles of young motivated individuals.  </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/574/273/c28d9b7e68d22757c56c322005bd2b45_large.jpeg?1367982181"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>As it turns out, Andre is more talented at the conceptual side of a creative process than drawing the idea out. This is when Armand joined the team and brought his skills and experience of both fashion and vehicle design into the mix.</p>
<p>Inspiration for the DayDreams come from many facets of a lifestyle befitting the FutrFootwear culture. Elements were taken from contemporary architecture, New York loft spaces, and even luxury vehicles. </p>
<p>The collaboration between Andre and Armand brought the notepad sketches along with the overall theme of the shoe, to the computer screen and software. The design was shown to fashion designers, professors of vehicle design, and even architecture grad students in brain-storming meetings for their insight and advice. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/574/547/959e595179d16d5309262d7e1f150f14_large.jpg?1367989207"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>When the renderings of the first concepts were finalized they were sent out to a manufacture to produce a sample prototype. Designs were altered with testing of the prototype to increase both comfort, aesthetics, and quality. A new sample was ordered form the manufacturer with the adjustments and testing was conducted across all standards. </p>
<p>Along with designing, adjusting, and testing the prototype, branding for the logo and branding for FutrFootwear is developing in synch with exposure to social media and advertising outlets.  </p>
<p><strong>Production Plan</strong></p>
<p>Here is the Production Process that has lead to the current prototype of the DayDreams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Designing the Shoes</li>
<li>Submitting Design to Manufacturer</li>
<li>Receiving the sample, making adjustments and testing</li>
<li>Submitting adjustments and receiving current sample</li>
<li>Final round of testing and minor adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The DayDreams were designed in-house and tested for quality, durability, comfort, and of course sexiness. This current prototype is fully functional and will look the same as the production models that will be ordered, with the exception of very minor changes such as changing the lace rings from silver to black.  </p>
<p><strong>Design </strong></p>
<p>The DayDreams were designed, for the FUTR Footwear culture, to be a shoe that could make many different statements. The shoes look perfect when worn casually, semi-formally, and even add a hint of funk when worn with your favorite suite. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/515/715/ec2a1c24ebb052d65f78d30ebd7bb506_large.jpg?1366003361"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Texture</strong></p>
<p>The diamond stitching is inspired by the upholstery found in classic luxury cars, and has even made a reappearance into modern luxury cars which use the texture to trigger nostalgia and romanticism of high end car culture. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/513/970/5c9787e4a33ac12985f52337b95ab746_large.jpg?1365926270"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Materials</strong></p>
<p>The Daydreams involve a combination of materials to produce a shoe that can make a statement in many different settings.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Leather |</strong> is the main material on the DayDreams and offers the luxurious feel and look that compliments the texture of the diamond stitching.</li>
<li>
<strong>Suede | </strong> trims on the DayDreams bring contrast of tones as well as the oh-so-smooth and sexy feel. </li>
<li>
<strong>Rubber | </strong>may not be smooth or sexy, but is found on the soles of the DayDreams which are designed carefully to offer comfort and stability as you wear them.</li>
</ul>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/514/527/f9336f00978ec019f4fa06cee602fdb0_large.jpg?1365959886"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>For the first edition of DayDreams, they will only come in black with a dark red interior. Of course, other colors are definitely going to be introduced for the DayDreams, including some special colors for limited edition series. As for now, the black color serves as a good starting point because it is a very flexible and universal shade for complimenting most outfits and moods. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/514/517/048cdcee89dc5f7cbd01424509e60de0_large.jpg?1365959764"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Quality</strong></p>
<p>FUTR Footwear is designed for young motivated individuals. This motivation involves a very active lifestyle, whether it is running from meeting to meeting or spending hours working behind a computer. This is why the DayDreams have been tested and made sure that they can keep up with anyone's daily activities and still make them feel like they own the building.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/514/529/c95eb31ffc4aca7aada5feebfdbc0377_large.jpg?1365959977"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p><strong>Sizes</strong></p>
<p>The DayDreams will be available in ten USA Adult Male sizes ranging from 8.5-13.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing</strong></p>
<p>The plans for manufacturing the final version of the DayDreams will involve dealing with an outside manufacturer. The firm that was chosen to produce the DayDreams was picked after a long process of interviewing, visting and examining multiple different manufacturers to ensure that the people making the DayDreams will meet strict standards. The standards that are expected of the manufacture are dedication to quality, commitment to ethical work standards, uses of environmentally friendly processes, timely delivery of the product, and of course, awesome people  to build a lasting relationship with. </p>
<p>Out of many manufacturers that were observed, the one that met all standards with excellence was chosen and collaboration has begun with the prototypes. The sole responsibility of the manufacturer at this point is to be ready to start producing orders of the DayDreams and delivering them to FutrFootwear</p>
<p>Since Andre and Armand both live their life's based on the FUTR Footwear culture of working towards success, they've spent close to a year testing the DayDreams on their own feet while they were up and about. Many adjustments were made until the DayDreams met the standard that was expected of them. </p>

<strong><em>Do We Really Know What We Are Doing? </em>| Experience and Commitment</strong> </h1>
<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>
<p>FUTR Footwear's Head Designer and Consultant on the Fashion Industry  has worked for years at Nikole Bakti, a large women's formal wear company based in Los Angeles, and the vision and advice he has brought to the table has helped FUTR Footwear become a ""new kid"" that knows his way around the block. </p>
<p><strong>Commitment</strong></p>
<p>Can we really pull this off? Of course we can! It is expected that making FUTR Footwear the perfect shoe company for young people striving for success, is no easy task but it is a task that we live and breath. The very culture that represents FUTR Footwear is the same culture that will ensure its own success. </p>

<p>Along with researching, testing, and improving the current DayDreams, FUTR Footwear has already come up with several special edition DayDreams that are in testing. </p>

<p><b>How will I benefit from a Scrubba Wash Pack?<br/></b>Being able to wash clothes anywhere, anytime means that you can pack less clothes when you travel and wash them for free.  You will save on bag fees at the airport and laundry fees, which we all know can be exorbitant when traveling.  You no longer need to buy a day pack or dry bag as the Scrubba Wash Pack performs these functions.  With the Scrubba Wash Pack, you really can follow the Scrubba mantra and travel clean, light and free.</p>

<p>Thanks for spreading the word and congratulations on getting your Scrubba product for free.  Credits above the purchase price are forfeited but before the campaign ends you can increase your purchase using the credits.</p>
<p>For Example: You pledged $99 for a Scrubba Wash Pack and then 15 of your referrals made purchases so you have $150 of credit.  After the campaign we will send you a refund for the $99.  However if you pledge for a second Scrubba Wash Pack, you can use the rest of the credit and you would have only paid $48 for 2 Scrubba Wash Packs.  For full details of our referral program, please click <a href=""http://thescrubba.com/pages/scrubba-wash-pack-indiegogo-referral-program"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a>.</p>
<p><b>How does the Scrubba Wash Pack wash clothes?<br/></b>The Scrubba Wash Pack works on the same principle as an old-fashion washboard.  Clothing is cleaned by rubbing them against the washboard.  As opposed to an old-fashion washboard, the Scrubba Wash Pack is lightweight, compact and self-contained (you no longer need a bucket or basin).  Furthermore, the Scrubba Wash Pack can minimise exposure of the user to cleaning materials.  Independent testing by one of Australasia’s leading washing machine manufacturers has shown that 3 minutes of rubbing in the Scrubba Wash Pack provides a machine quality wash.</p>
<p><b>Do I wear the Scrubba Wash Pack when washing clothes?</b></p>
<p>While that sounds pretty cool, it would be pretty heavy and the clothes wouldn't rub against the washboard enough to clean clothes.  See the question above for how to wash clothes in the Scrubba Wash Pack.  </p>
<p><b>How much clothing can be washed at once?<br/></b>Generally, the Scrubba Wash Pack is effective at cleaning a couple of T-shirts, a couple of pairs of underwear and a couple of pairs of socks at once (e.g. 2 days worth of summer clothes).  While the Scrubba Wash Pack can hold more clothing, the washing efficiency may be reduced if too much clothing is added.</p>
<p><b>How large is the Scrubba Wash Pack?<br/></b>The Scrubba Wash Pack when laid flat measures approximately 54 cm x 32 cm (21.3 x 12.6 inches).  You can pack it in your travel bag flat, compactly rolled up or use it to organise your clothes and separate them from your other travel gear.</p>
<p><b>How does the valve work?<br/></b>Our air valves are double closure air valves.  The first closure is the cap, while the second is a deformable base component.  In its normal position, the deformable base component will not let air out of the valve.  To let air out simply open the cap and squeeze the sides of the valve.  This will force the base component open at the slit.  Squeezing the valve from the outside while watching from the inside will help to determine the best finger positioning that enables the air flow channel to open.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What's the quickest way to expel air from the Scrubba Wash Pack?<br/></b>We know that the valve on the Scrubba Wash Pack is pretty small.  The reason for this is to keep the Scrubba Wash Pack compact, light and flexible.  However, this does mean that expelling a large amount of air through the valve can take some time.  You can quicken the process by laying the bag down and gently pressing on it to remove most of the air before you seal the bag.  After sealing the bag you can get rid of any remaining excess air by opening and squeezing the valve.</p>
<p><b>What is the capacity of the Scrubba Wash Pack?<br/></b>The total volume of the Scrubba Wash Pack is around 13L (~3 gal).  However, as the washing method requires you to seal the bag and rub the clothes against the washboard from the outside, the optimal working volume is around 3-4L (~1gal).  We have markings on the front of the Scrubba Wash Pack to help you add the right amount of water and clothes.</p>
<p><b>How long does the Scrubba Wash Pack take to clean a load of clothing?<br/></b>For most clothing, simply rubbing them against the washboard from outside the bag for 20-40 seconds is sufficient to remove oils, dirt and odour from the clothing.  For a machine quality wash, rub the clothes for 3 minutes and use a quality laundry liquid.  For stubborn stains, the clothing may be rubbed for longer and/or the clothing may be allowed to soak in the Scrubba Wash Pack for 2-3 hours.  If soaking clothing in the Scrubba Wash Pack, ensure the Scrubba Wash Pack is stored upright (e.g. seal facing upwards) to prevent water wicking through the seal.</p>
<p><b>Can I use hot water in the Scrubba Wash Pack?<br/></b>Due to the waterproof lining in the bag, we recommend that water no hotter than 50°C (122°F) be used.  Warm water (e.g. 30°C – 50°C or 85°F – 122°F ) can assist the washing process. Simply put, if it is too hot to hold your hands in, the water is too hot for the Scrubba Wash Pack.</p>
<p><b>What cleaning product should be used with the Scrubba Wash Pack?<br/></b>A variety of detergents have been tested in the Scrubba Wash Pack with success. We've found the use of liquid detergents to be more efficient due to the extra time it takes to dissolve solid detergents (powders, leaves, etc.). Using a liquid enables active suds immediately, reducing the overall time required for rubbing out a wash.</p>
<p>While the Scrubba Wash Pack has been made with a highly chemically resistant form of urethane, use of very harsh bleaches may reduce its longevity. We do not recommend soaking with such products in the Scrubba Wash Pack for prolonged periods</p>
<p>We are conscious of the fact that every traveler has different priorities. For some travelers, weight is the most important factor in packing, so a single product that can perform multiple tasks is beneficial. A small dollop of 3-in-1 bodywash-shampoo-shave liquid may be used in the Scrubba Wash Pack and we have found this to work well in refreshing clothes.</p>
<p>If you don't mind carrying extra products, then packing a very small (~25-30ml) bottle of washing liquid (e.g. Omo or the like) is a good idea when traveling. Washing liquids are generally the most efficient for cleaning your clothes, as they are purpose designed for removing oils and dirt from fabrics. You really only need to use the smallest amount (probably a few ml per bag load) as washing liquids are generally highly concentrated.</p>
<p>For environmentally conscious travelers, there are a number of bio-washing liquids on the market (often released by outdoor brands and available at camping stores) that are better for the environment (e.g. phosphate free). These probably fall somewhere between using bodywash/shampoo and a washing liquid in efficiency but are much better for use in the back country. </p>
<p>You can test for quantities of different cleaning products in the Scrubba Wash Pack by checking the amount of suds visible through the clear section of the bag. If you still have suds after 30 seconds of rubbing, then you can probably reduce the amount of product for the next batch. Optimising the amount is not only better for the environment, but will also minimise the amount of rinsing required.</p>
<p><b>Why isn't there a loop for hanging the Scrubba Wash Pack to dry?<br/></b>As we recommend turning  the Scrubba Wash Pack inside out after use to dry, the loop would need to be added to the inside of the bag, which would affect the washing performance.  When you turn the bag inside out, you can make good use of the clips to hang the inverted bag to dry.  This is shown in the following image:</p>
<p></p>

<p><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>How do I reduce water wicking out of the seal?</b><br/></p>
<p>How do I reduce water wicking out of the seal?While our fabric and the seams of the Scrubba Wash Pack are waterproof, the roll-down-and-clip closure can allow a small amount of water to wick through over time.  This can be minimised by rolling the top down as tightly as possible and at least 4-5 times.  When tightly rolled, water typically won't wick through the top for at least 20 minutes, which should be a sufficient amount of time to perform a standard Scrubba wash.  If you position the buckles of the roll-down-and-clip seal to face upwards, this will also reduce wicking. </p>
<p><b>How long will the Scrubba Wash Pack last and how do I care for it?<br/></b>The Scrubba Wash Pack is designed to last and you can take steps to ensure a prolonged life.  This includes avoiding contact with sharp objects which could puncture the Scrubba Wash Pack, avoiding contact with strong bleaches, abrasive surfaces and high temperatures (less than 50°C (122°F) is fine).  For good hygiene we also recommend turning the Scrubba Wash Pack inside out to allow the bag to dry.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is there a warranty on the Scrubba Wash Pack?<br/></b>Is there a warranty on the Scrubba Wash Pack? Yes.  To the original owner,  our company, Calibre8 Pty Ltd, provides a guarantee against defects in materials and craftsmanship. If your product fails due to a defect, we will replace, repair or refund it at our discretion.  While manufacturing defects are rare, the occasional bad egg can sometimes make it past our dedicated quality control inspection team.  If there is a defect in the materials or craftsmanship, you will realise fairly quickly and all you need to do is email us at info@thescrubba.com and we will work with you to make it right.  </p>If you are purchasing a Scrubba Wash Pack before a trip, we suggest that you test the Scrubba Wash Pack before you leave as there are some pretty remote parts to the world that can make replacing the bag difficult.<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Can the Scrubba Wash Pack be used on all clothing?<br/></b>The Scrubba Wash Pack can be used on most forms of clothing.  While clothing made of thick materials such as denim jeans may be washed in the Scrubba Wash Pack, it may be necessary to open the bag and rotate the jeans to ensure sufficient contact between the whole jeans and the washboard.  Care needs to be taken for clothing with zips or buckles, which could potentially damage the internal coating of the Scrubba Wash Pack.</p>
<b>Will the Scrubba Wash Pack damage my clothing?<br/></b>Independent testing by one of Australasia’s leading washing machine manufacturers has shown that the Scrubba Wash Pack is gentler on clothing that washing machines and on par with handwashing.  However, as all washing techniques cause some wear on clothes, users should always follow the washing instructions on their clothing.<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Can my Scrubba Wash Pack be repaired?<br/></b>It sure can and we are planning to include a repair patch that is really simple to use. The repair patch is made from the same type of fabric as the front of the Scrubba Wash Pack and has a purpose designed urethane adhesive.  Simply clean the area of the Scrubba Wash Pack that needs to be repaired, cut the patch to size, remove the backing of the repair patch and apply the patch to the shiny side of the fabric (the inside of the bag).  Press patch firmly over the repair area and allow the adhesive to cure for 4 hours before use.</p>
<p>Alternately, a bicycle tyre puncture repair kit (from your local bicycle store) or inflatable mattress/tent repair kit (most camping stores sell this) may be used.</p>
<b>How do I dry my clothing?<br/></b>Great question.  You can simply wring out the clothes and hang them to dry or use the Scrubba wash &amp; dry pack, which includes a large Scrubba travel towel, inflatable hangers and pegless clothesline.  After rinsing the clothing, lay them on the Scrubba towel.  Roll the towel up and press down on the towel as hard as you can.  This will transfer much of the residual water from the clothing to the towel.<br/><p></p>
<p><b>What do I do with the dirty water if I am camping or trekking?</b></p>
<p>If you use the Scrubba Wash Pack in the countryside, we recommend using an environmentally friendly laundry liquid to minimise potential damage to the local ecosystem.  Most camping stores sell a range of eco laundry liquids.  If washing near a water source (e.g. a river, stream, lake, etc.), we recommend that dirty water be tipped out at least 30 metres (100 feet) from the water source to prevent pollution.</p>
<p><b>How long are the shoulder and waist straps?<br/></b>Each of the shoulder straps are adjustable between around 55 cm to 105 cm [21-41 inches] (with an additional 40 cm [16 inches] between the anchor points) and the waist strap is adjustable between around 47 cm and 90 cm [18.5-35 inches] (with an additional 15cm [6 inches] between the anchor points). If you feel you may need longer straps, please contact us and we will see what we can do.</p>
<p><b>What is the purpose of the waist strap and pouch?<br/></b>The waist strap functions to hold the pouch, which has convenient pockets large enough for most smart phones and passports, making it great for use at the airport.  For those who are more active, the waist strap also assists in keeping the Scrubba Wash Pack tight against the body, which can be important for active pursuits such as jogging and hiking to minimise the bag bouncing around.</p>
<p><b>Why would I buy this instead of a Scrubba wash bag?<br/></b>The Scrubba wash bag is the world’s smallest and lightest washing machine for travel and camping.  If you don’t need a lightweight day pack, then the Scrubba wash bag may be more suitable for you and they are available globally at <a href=""http://thescrubba.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thescrubba.com</a> and <a href=""http://thescrubba.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thescrubba.com.au</a> (for Australians).  However, if like most people you pack a daypack in your backpack or suitcase when you travel, then you will love the Scrubba Wash Pack.  Not only is it a lightweight, weatherproof and versatile day pack, but at the end of the day you can still wash your clothes in just minutes.</p>
<p><b>What if I only like messenger-style sling bags?<br/></b>No worries at all.  We know people like to wear bags differently, which is why the Scrubba Wash Pack has been designed to be extremely versatile.  If you don’t like the waist strap, simply un-clip it – it only takes seconds.  If you don’t want to wear it like a backpack, just unclip one of the shoulder straps and adjust the length of the remaining shoulder strap.  Now you have a sling bag. It really is that easy.</p>
<p><b>Do I need the Scrubba Wash &amp; Dry Pack?<br/></b>If you like your clean clothes to also be dry then you may need it.  Just kidding.  It is possible and quite easy to dry clothes after washing them in the Scrubba Wash Pack.  Simply wring them out and find somewhere to hang them.  Where the Scrubba Wash &amp; Dry Pack comes in handy is that it includes a huge travel towel that can accelerate the drying process by par drying the clothes before you hang them on the inflatable hangers or pegless clothesline that are included in the Wash &amp; Dry Pack.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions


The logo looks different in the videos and images.  Why is this and how will the final product look like?
The Scrubba Wash Pack has been an 18 month project and we have had several prototypes along the way as the product (and the logo) has evolved.  The video and photos show some of the different prototypes along the way but your product has a more discreet and cool looking logo.  It will look more like this image:

How will I benefit from a Scrubba Wash Pack?Being able to wash clothes anywhere, anytime means that you can pack less clothes when you travel and wash them for free.  You will save on bag fees at the airport and laundry fees, which we all know can be exorbitant when traveling.  You no longer need to buy a day pack or dry bag as the Scrubba Wash Pack performs these functions.  With the Scrubba Wash Pack, you really can follow the Scrubba mantra and travel clean, light and free.

If you still have suds after 30 seconds of rubbing, then you can probably reduce the amount of product for the next batch. Optimising the amount is not only better for the environment, but will also minimise the amount of rinsing required.
Why isn't there a loop for hanging the Scrubba Wash Pack to dry?As we recommend turning  the Scrubba Wash Pack inside out after use to dry, the loop would need to be added to the inside of the bag, which would affect the washing performance.  When you turn the bag inside out, you can make good use of the clips to hang the inverted bag to dry.  This is shown in the following image:




How do I reduce water wicking out of the seal?
How do I reduce water wicking out of the seal?While our fabric and the seams of the Scrubba Wash Pack are waterproof, the roll-down-and-clip closure can allow a small amount of water to wick through over time.  This can be minimised by rolling the top down as tightly as possible and at least 4-5 times.  When tightly rolled, water typically won't wick through the top for at least 20 minutes, which should be a sufficient amount of time to perform a standard Scrubba wash.  If you position the buckles of the roll-down-and-clip seal to face upwards, this will also reduce wicking. 
How long will the Scrubba Wash Pack last and how do I care for it?The Scrubba Wash Pack is designed to last and you can take steps to ensure a prolonged life.  This includes avoiding contact with sharp objects which could puncture the Scrubba Wash Pack, avoiding contact with strong bleaches, abrasive surfaces and high temperatures (less than 50°C (122°F) is fine).  For good hygiene we also recommend turning the Scrubba Wash Pack inside out to allow the bag to dry.


Is there a warranty on the Scrubba Wash Pack?Is there a warranty on the Scrubba Wash Pack? Yes.  To the original owner,  our company, Calibre8 Pty Ltd, provides a guarantee against defects in materials and craftsmanship. If your product fails due to a defect, we will replace, repair or refund it at our discretion.  While manufacturing defects are rare, the occasional bad egg can sometimes make it past our dedicated quality control inspection team.  If there is a defect in the materials or craftsmanship, you will realise fairly quickly and all you need to do is email us at info@thescrubba.com and we will work with you to make it right.  If you are purchasing a Scrubba Wash Pack before a trip, we suggest that you test the Scrubba Wash Pack before you leave as there are some pretty remote parts to the world that can make replacing the bag difficult.
Can the Scrubba Wash Pack be used on all clothing?The Scrubba Wash Pack can be used on most forms of clothing.  While clothing made of thick materials such as denim jeans may be washed in the Scrubba Wash Pack, it may be necessary to open the bag and rotate the jeans to ensure sufficient contact between the whole jeans and the washboard.  Care needs to be taken for clothing with zips or buckles, which could potentially damage the internal coating of the Scrubba Wash Pack.
Will the Scrubba Wash Pack damage my clothing?Independent testing by one of Australasia’s leading washing machine manufacturers has shown that the Scrubba Wash Pack is gentler on clothing that washing machines and on par with handwashing.  However, as all washing techniques cause some wear on clothes, users should always follow the washing instructions on their clothing.
Can my Scrubba Wash Pack be repaired?It sure can and we are planning to include a repair patch that is really simple to use. The repair patch is made from the same type of fabric as the front of the Scrubba Wash Pack and has a purpose designed urethane adhesive.  Simply clean the area of the Scrubba Wash Pack that needs to be repaired, cut the patch to size, remove the backing of the repair patch and apply the patch to the shiny side of the fabric (the inside of the bag).  Press patch firmly over the repair area and allow the adhesive to cure for 4 hours before use.
Alternately, a bicycle tyre puncture repair kit (from your local bicycle store) or inflatable mattress/tent repair kit (most camping stores sell this) may be used.
How do I dry my clothing?Great question.  You can simply wring out the clothes and hang them to dry or use the Scrubba wash & dry pack, which includes a large Scrubba travel towel, inflatable hangers and pegless clothesline.  After rinsing the clothing, lay them on the Scrubba towel.  Roll the towel up and press down on the towel as hard as you can.  This will transfer much of the residual water from the clothing to the towel.
What do I do with the dirty water if I am camping or trekking?
If you use the Scrubba Wash Pack in the countryside, we recommend using an environmentally friendly laundry liquid to minimise potential damage to the local ecosystem.  Most camping stores sell a range of eco laundry liquids.  If washing near a water source (e.g. a river, stream, lake, etc.), we recommend that dirty water be tipped out at least 30 metres (100 feet) from the water source to prevent pollution.
How long are the shoulder and waist straps?Each of the shoulder straps are adjustable between around 55 cm to 105 cm [21-41 inches] (with an additional 40 cm [16 inches] between the anchor points) and the waist strap is adjustable between around 47 cm and 90 cm [18.5-35 inches] (with an additional 15cm [6 inches] between the anchor points). If you feel you may need longer straps, please contact us and we will see what we can do.
What is the purpose of the waist strap and pouch?The waist strap functions to hold the pouch, which has convenient pockets large enough for most smart phones and passports, making it great for use at the airport.  For those who are more active, the waist strap also assists in keeping the Scrubba Wash Pack tight against the body, which can be important for active pursuits such as jogging and hiking to minimise the bag bouncing around.
Why would I buy this instead of a Scrubba wash bag?The Scrubba wash bag is the world’s smallest and lightest washing machine for travel and camping.  If you don’t need a lightweight day pack, then the Scrubba wash bag may be more suitable for you and they are available globally at thescrubba.com and thescrubba.com.au (for Australians).  However, if like most people you pack a daypack in your backpack or suitcase when you travel, then you will love the Scrubba Wash Pack.  Not only is it a lightweight, weatherproof and versatile day pack, but at the end of the day you can still wash your clothes in just minutes.
What if I only like messenger-style sling bags?No worries at all.  We know people like to wear bags differently, which is why the Scrubba Wash Pack has been designed to be extremely versatile.  If you don’t like the waist strap, simply un-clip it – it only takes seconds.  If you don’t want to wear it like a backpack, just unclip one of the shoulder straps and adjust the length of the remaining shoulder strap.  Now you have a sling bag. It really is that easy.
Do I need the Scrubba Wash & Dry Pack?If you like your clean clothes to also be dry then you may need it.  Just kidding.  It is possible and quite easy to dry clothes after washing them in the Scrubba Wash Pack.  Simply wring them out and find somewhere to hang them.  Where the Scrubba Wash & Dry Pack comes in handy is that it includes a huge travel towel that can accelerate the drying process by par drying the clothes before you hang them on the inflatable hangers or pegless clothesline that are included in the Wash & Dry Pack.
I'm from the media and want to run a feature on the Scrubba Wash Pack.  How do I get more information?

Thanks for your interest in spreading the word about the Scrubba Wash Pack.  Please send us an email to info@thescrubba.com and we will provide you with our media pack.

<p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>Production - We experienced explosive success in our first crowdfund, selling over 10,000 dresses (when our goal was ""only"" to sell 400) and as a result we had major production delays. We learned a lot, and we now have more experience, have tested factories that have been proven to be reliable, and have a team that is more ready than ever. If we are lucky enough to be as successful as we were in the past, we are 100% positive that we now have the knowledge, contacts, and resources to complete this project in a timely manner. In comparison, we are already much, much farther in development on Version 2 (and ready to produce) than we were on Version 1 when we launched last year. Production is always a challenge, but we are very confident that we have all the right partners, and resources to get the job done, and done well!</p><br/></div>","The Undress - SPORT, allows you to CHANGE CLOTHES, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, WITHOUT GETTING NAKED.

</div></div>","Our Story
A project 17 years in the making, The Athaenum is the brainchild of Shaye Mckenney, creator and owner of La Library.  Aptly named, La Library was a former prototype clothing library housed in San Francisco’s Mission District. The new-and-improved project, The Athenaeum, will be an eco-friendly fashion library and community events space in the San Francisco Bay Area. It will make new and used haute couture, designer, vintage, and reconstructed clothing accessible to folks from all economic backgrounds. The Athenaeum will also provide in-house librarians (professional stylists) to help clientele put together selections from the collections to meet individual needs.Beyond providing the community with an affordable way of attaining fashion and style, the Athenaeum's ultimate purpose will be to provide an alternative to ideas of ownership, and take the focus away from personal possession and place it instead on community sharing.  Lastly it will offer various classes, and fashion design internships for aspiring youths.

The Impact
 
We believe in making the world a more beautiful place & that fashion alongside with sharing is one medium through which this can be achieved.  The Athenaeum model reduces waste such as that created by “fast-fashion” and by giving a new “living” home for the “dead storage” of people’s unused treasures hibernating in the backs of their closets. 
Another main purpose of the library is to facilitate community-building via an in-house fashion design program and by hosting a variety of classes, all of which bring a diverse population together.  Diversity is key to a strong environment. We are working to build a place where people who normally might not cross paths can find common joys, build new friendships, and learn from each other. In summary, our method of commerce will not only provide one of the most eco-friendly and socially just fashion options to local consumers, it will also strengthen a weakened local economy, build and strengthen community, foster the arts, and provide professional opportunities to San Francisco’s youth.
 


What We Need & What You Get

If we exceed our funding goal, additional donations will be put towards the purchase of a trailer for use as a mobile library and towards shooting a reality TV show about the Athenaeum and eventually expanding to open another library in Los Angeles.  If our goal isn't reached, the money will stay in a trust fund as we pursue other avenues to complete funding and will be used altogether once funding is complete.

</div></div>","Unlike standard smartwatches, which use large digital displays and need to be recharged daily, the Mas Carney is a smartwatch with a traditional watch face that runs for well over a year on a single battery. It also allows you to wear a smartwatch only you’ll know is a smartwatch.


 



Stainless Steel BodyBuilt using time-honed watchmaking techniques, the Mas Carney is constructed with quality in mind. The case and back uses 316L Stainless Steel to protect the hybrid mechanical interior movement and to give it a 5 ATM waterproof rating.

Your Choice of ColorDecide between two simple, bold colors for your Mas Carney - Copper or Steel - to add a regal tone to your wrist.

Sapphire CoatingMas Carney's simple and dignified face is protected by crystal glass with a sapphire coating making it essentially scratch-proof.

Genuine Leather StrapAnd it rests gently on your wrist with a fully adjustable and replaceable leather strap. Each Mas Carney also arrives with a silicone strap allowing you to switch out straps at any time and for any occasion.
 

Let your watch do more than just tell the time. Mas Carney syncs to your smartphone to silently update you of every important notification.

Phone AlertsMas Carney gently vibrates to inform you when calls or texts reach your phone. You can set specific actions for your Mas Carney to display individual contacts calls; its seconds hand will move to specific icons on the watch face to show you different incoming notifications.
Silent Alarm ClockSet up your Mas Carney to act as a silent alarm clock for all your notifications. It will vibrate on your wrist to wake you up each morning, remind you of your after-lunch meetings, and tell you it's time to read before bed.

NFC E-CardShare your contact information or phone number just by holding your Mas Carney up other phones who have enabled NFC sharing.

Time SyncThe Mas Carney automatically syncs to whatever time zone you find yourself in. 


Fitness NotificationsFitted with comprehensive activity tracking, Mas Carney tracks your fitness information when you’re walking, running, swimming or even sleeping. Just select the appropriate mode on the iPowerful App and it'll do the rest.

Sedentary AlertsIt’ll even remind you get moving with its sedentary alerts when you sit still for too long.

Real Time Data AnalysisMas Carney compiles all of this data for you in the iPowerful App for easy analysis. See everything from your steps taken and distance covered to the activities you’ve done that day.
 

Unlike many other hybrid and full smartwatches Mas Carney works as hard as you do. Thanks to its powerful button battery it is guaranteed to run for a full year using daily smart features before needing a battery replacement. And if you use it as just a regular watch its battery can last up to 4 years.

<p><strong>CURRENT PROJECT: MAHAMERU  </strong></p>
<p>The new model takes its name from Mount Mahameru, or “Great Mountain,"" an active stratovolcano and the highest mountain in Indonesia’s most populated island, Java. The design pays homage to the classic dress watches from the 1950s such as the 1954 Omega Seamaster. The design revisits not only the elements but also the spirit of classic watchmaking, an era where craftsmanship and quality came first, and beauty naturally followed.</p>
<p><strong>DESIGNS &amp; INSPIRATIONS </strong> </p>
<p>The Mahameru design of pays homage to the classic dress watches from the 1950s such as 1954 Omega Seamaster, 1959 Rolex Tudor, and 1954 Ulysse Nardin. The design chose to revisit not only the design elements but also the spirit of 1950s classic watchmaking, an era where craftsmanship and quality come first, and beauty naturally comes out through utility rather than mere fashion accents.</p>
<p>Through the Mahameru, we try aims to invite those that have directly experienced 1950s watches to relive the era and create a new story of their own. We believe that a watch’s value isn’t measured in currency, but rather the story it brings and moments its wearers associate with it – there is no real value in hefty price tags for poor specifications and played out designs. To achieve this, we offer our watches at the price that won’t put a hole in your pocket to invite more people to join and write the story together.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503110574/rghoyis2xjjgj0qll0xg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Dress watch and classic touch are the perfect mixes, make that watch very suitable to be a reminder, put the debate aside, we can all agree that some people can relive the moment and memories just by wearing and looking into the watch, especially those who really knew the story behind the watch. All more reasons to make the classic watch is an area that many people are attracted to. </p>
<p>More wanted, means more pricey, that you might end up pay about thousand dollars to own one. We intend to make our timepieces similar to that category, but with a bargain price, so it won’t make your constraints about the budget. What makes this watch so interesting is it has some details and quality you will not usually find at this price point.</p>

<p>The 3rd step is assessing a design from the 3-dimensional point of view makes our timepieces’ prototypes being more accurate and representative after the sampling process is finished.</p>
<p>With an elegant round case in steel, we offer the Mahameru in a polished steel case and rose gold colors. The case is 39mm wide, 11.8mm thick, 47mm lug to lug and 18mm lug width. These combinations make the Mahameru a very comfortable and exceedingly wrist-friendly option for those with smaller or thinner wrists. It will really hit the spot, not too big nor small. The Mahameru also have water resistant to 100m and have the double AR-coated sapphire crystal. The case is produced in stainless steel and has a see-through case back.  </p>
<p>The dial is also interesting and attractive part here. We offered 5 dial and case combinations from cream white, black and even blue dials. Dial colors vary with the combination of baton-style hour markers and Arabic numeral 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock hour markers with applied indices, making for a slightly dressier look. Breaking up the smooth expanses you have the logo up at 12 o'clock and the small seconds dial down at 6 o'clock. One bit of visual interest pops up in this sub dial - the 60 is printed in red to adds more visual appeal to the watch. We put the radial guilloche dial pattern on the sub dial to make it more aesthetic for the users. The hour and minute hands are done in a sword style which matches nicely with the hour markers. The Mahameru will feature a black leather band, while the red gold iteration comes on a brown leather strap.</p>

</div></div>","CURRENT PROJECT: MAHAMERU  
The new model takes its name from Mount Mahameru, or “Great Mountain,"" an active stratovolcano and the highest mountain in Indonesia’s most populated island, Java. The design pays homage to the classic dress watches from the 1950s such as the 1954 Omega Seamaster. The design revisits not only the elements but also the spirit of classic watchmaking, an era where craftsmanship and quality came first, and beauty naturally followed.
DESIGNS & INSPIRATIONS  
The Mahameru design of pays homage to the classic dress watches from the 1950s such as 1954 Omega Seamaster, 1959 Rolex Tudor, and 1954 Ulysse Nardin. The design chose to revisit not only the design elements but also the spirit of 1950s classic watchmaking, an era where craftsmanship and quality come first, and beauty naturally comes out through utility rather than mere fashion accents.
Through the Mahameru, we try aims to invite those that have directly experienced 1950s watches to relive the era and create a new story of their own. We believe that a watch’s value isn’t measured in currency, but rather the story it brings and moments its wearers associate with it – there is no real value in hefty price tags for poor specifications and played out designs. To achieve this, we offer our watches at the price that won’t put a hole in your pocket to invite more people to join and write the story together.

Dress watch and classic touch are the perfect mixes, make that watch very suitable to be a reminder, put the debate aside, we can all agree that some people can relive the moment and memories just by wearing and looking into the watch, especially those who really knew the story behind the watch. All more reasons to make the classic watch is an area that many people are attracted to. 
More wanted, means more pricey, that you might end up pay about thousand dollars to own one. We intend to make our timepieces similar to that category, but with a bargain price, so it won’t make your constraints about the budget. What makes this watch so interesting is it has some details and quality you will not usually find at this price point.
DESIGN PROCESS  
Hand Sketching 

Hand sketching is the very 1st step that we've done to manifested our thought to something real.
3D DESIGNING


The 3rd step is assessing a design from the 3-dimensional point of view makes our timepieces’ prototypes being more accurate and representative after the sampling process is finished.
With an elegant round case in steel, we offer the Mahameru in a polished steel case and rose gold colors. The case is 39mm wide, 11.8mm thick, 47mm lug to lug and 18mm lug width. These combinations make the Mahameru a very comfortable and exceedingly wrist-friendly option for those with smaller or thinner wrists. It will really hit the spot, not too big nor small. The Mahameru also have water resistant to 100m and have the double AR-coated sapphire crystal. The case is produced in stainless steel and has a see-through case back.  
The dial is also interesting and attractive part here. We offered 5 dial and case combinations from cream white, black and even blue dials. Dial colors vary with the combination of baton-style hour markers and Arabic numeral 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock hour markers with applied indices, making for a slightly dressier look. Breaking up the smooth expanses you have the logo up at 12 o'clock and the small seconds dial down at 6 o'clock. One bit of visual interest pops up in this sub dial - the 60 is printed in red to adds more visual appeal to the watch. We put the radial guilloche dial pattern on the sub dial to make it more aesthetic for the users. The hour and minute hands are done in a sword style which matches nicely with the hour markers. The Mahameru will feature a black leather band, while the red gold iteration comes on a brown leather strap.
THE DETAILS  
Case and Finishing


A dress watch should have the polished finish rather than the brushed one. The smooth surface indicates our watches to have a top notch polished finishing crown.
Guilloche Subdial 

The term ""Guilloche"" is also used more generally for repetitive architectural patterns of intersecting or overlapping spirals or other shapes, as used in the classic architectural decorations. We adopted it in our sub dial patterns as you can see.
Applied Indices 

We used applied indices which are also known as “Applique Indices”, using raised metal batons attached to the dial via adhesion or pegs.
Engraved Crown 

The Crown is positioned between 4 and 5 markers. It is engraved with the initial letter “N” from NAM at its side. A little detail yet leaves a strong impression.
See Through Back Case  

With a transparent back case, you can peek into our watch’s heart, which is the mechanical movements of Miyota 8245.
Engraved Buckle 

Our buckle is made from 316L stainless steel (which has high a corrosion resistant) with a polished finishing touch. It is also engraved with initial letter “N” from NAM at its side.
Curved-End Leather Strap

Our watch’s band has a curved end with the padded style, making it suitable for watches with round cases. These watch bands allow for a smoother transition between your watch and the watch band. All of them are also made from genuine leather which will sit comfortably on your wrist.
Packaging

We used recycled paper from the home industry as the main material, which is eco-friendly and non-toxicant. We did all the little things above because of nothing but to support their economy even if it's not significant and to keep the environment green. Constructed with semi-rigid built and customized for safety.
THE MOVEMENT 

From the inside, Mahameru is powered by Miyota 8245 which is a non-hacking twenty-one (21) jewels with an accuracy of -20 to +40 seconds per day, and a power reserve of over 40 hours which can be seen through the back case that engraved with NAM logo on the rotor.

(Check out more of my work at Cescca.net)My love for children's wear developed my senior year at SCAD, and I have never looked back. There is a huge need in the American kid's wear market for clothes that are FUN, not just functional!Cescca||Dew Drops||What is it?
 Dew Drops is a collection I designed for Cescca while a senior at the Savannah College of Art and Design. Since graduation, I have wanted to put the collection into production -and the timing just feels right, right now. The collection features about 20 looks, for girls ages 3-8. You can see the full collection at Cescca.net! Cescca||Dew Drops||Money Talk$4000. Thats a lot of money. Here's where it is going to go:
An industrial sewing machine - about $1000
A pattern/cutting table - about $400
Fabric!!! - about $1000
Yarn!! - about $1000
Notions (zippers, buttons, etc.) - about $350
Even if I don't reach $4000, even if I don't come close - every dollar helps get me closer to making the collection a reality. 

Cescca||Dew Drops||Perks!!

Crocheted accessories - these are created by hand, from silk or wool (backer's choice.) Small accessories, for the $10 reward will be coin wallets, cell phone cases, etc. Large accessories will be scarves, hats, or gloves (backer's choice.)
The famous owl print! The very first and most popular print that I have designed, seen here:

The tote bag will feature the print, but not be overpowered by the print - and each one will be unique. Crocheted details will be on the owls!

Cescca||Dew Drops||Why Cescca?
Why this campaign? I want to change American kid's wear. I'm tired of seeing pink dresses, blue suits, or a shirt with a Disney character - and that's it. Let's spice up children's wear with prints and crazy shapes! And it is time to bring back well made kid's clothes. Made in the USA. Touched by hands who love what they do.Why now? I am ready to make my dreams a reality. I have wanted to be a fashion designer since I was about 5. I'm 30 now, and I don't know when another opportunity to try will come. Soon marriage and kids and other responsibilities will take over my life.Cescca||Dew Drops||How to Help
There are so many ways to help spread the word, donations are not the only way to send me to fashion week!
Social Media - don't blast, but please share on facebook, twitter, etc.
E-mails to friends and family!
Good ol' fashioned conversation!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

With over 5 years of website and graphic design experience I have decided to combine both my passions into one project. As an individual I work hard to keep my day job, AFO and currently TruthTShirts afloat, and as much fun as I have creating new content and designs, it consumes alot of my time and money, and that is why I am asking for your help.</p>
<p>TruthTShirts.com is just coming to the end of it's beta phase but cannot do so without the essential tools. Most of these tools have already been purchased and are in full working order, however I do not currently have the funds required to complete the final piece of the jigsaw - the Roland GX-24 Vinyl Cutter (pictured at the top of this page).</p>
<p>The vinyl cutter is just what I need to make the leap from making average quality t-shirts, to brilliant quality t-shirts the buyers deserve. However the cutter comes with a hefty price above it's head, over 1000 GBP. The t-shirts I am currently making are of an average standard, and come at a low price. With your help I will be able to improve the t-shirts to store quality standards, but also keep the same cost efficient price. TruthTshirts is trying to spread the word to the world at the lowest cost possible, but I can only do it with your help.</p>

<p>With the amount of money I am currently earning from month to month it would be next to impossible to afford a piece of equipment of this <span>caliber</span>.

<p>Truth T Shirts is exactly what it says in the title - a T-shirt website that is here to bring the <em>real</em> information to light through informative clothing. High quality, professional designs are being created every day on a wide variety of different subjects, such as aliens, UFOs, Chemtrails and fluoride etc, but if I am going to be taken seriously in the worldwide truth movement, a higher quality piece of equipment is required. If you wish to find out more about what your money would be funding, visit the website:</p>

<p>It is easier for us to keep track of our customers wishes and shipping details in a central system like CrowdOx. Once you select and purchase a perk on our IndieGogo campaign, you will receive an invitation from CrowdOx within 24 hours. With that invitation you can manage your pledge: you can select the options you want for your watch (wood type, movement color) and maintain your shipping address. You can even change your options and shipping address during the campaign by clicking the same invitation in your e-mail.</p></figure></div><div data-id=""14072538""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480456803/chdplbwtwxlidc9twzcd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""14072550""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480456804/uppm9kzilosgs61s8901.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""14072555""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480456806/dwmlvhh9pbvorohaqjaz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""14018331""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480456807/vhveyv8amm8rvdizsgqp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""14018334""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480456808/cjwxjvsucxnuu7gsixsd.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""14018337""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480456808/ylakz9cgkcjwqgspvftw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""14018340""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480456809/gug3si2qxwfexaz7tojn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""14018344""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480456810/xnedhe6d7q4prglhs8dk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p>That’s us, Theo and Bart.

We’re two real Dutchmen with a passion for bold, practical and stylish design, and we make up Lumbr. The idea for Lumbr originated in the summer of 2013 when we invented the Beatblok, a wireless wooden speaker.We started selling our handcrafted wooden products, and apparently the Netherlands had been waiting for this crossover between authentic craftsmanship and contemporary design for quite some time. We acquired fans throughout the entire country, and just like that, Lumbr was off to a brilliant start! In the meantime, both our collection and our team have expanded. We’ve gained fame outside the Dutch borders, as well, while our passion has stayed the same: create beautiful wooden products with a sturdy look, bold design and an honest price. So, thank you all for your support, and thanks for climbing aboard!  We want to say thank you for checking out our project and for helping us make Troy a success.A stretch goal lies just beyond the horizon, and we know you can help us get there, so share your hearts out, and we’ll continue to do our part!We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can’t give a dollar or buy a watch, if you love the project as much as we do, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!",43.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have professional experience in brand management, so I have always had a profound passion for marketing and strategy from a global perspective and understand the importance of creating consumer first brands and products. As a Nigerian woman that was born in Paris, France and raised in Vienna, Austria, Lagos, Nigeria, Kuwait city, Kuwait and Texas in the United States, my collective experiences have shaped my creative passions. I desire to offer people a taste of various cultures through connecting distinct cultural designs that create comfortable and quality loungewear items designed to be worn at home.  </p>
<p>PJGB’s founder is a nomad that has lived in various countries around the world as a 3rd culture kid, and has been on the journey to be comfortable in her own skin. PJGB is just that. Comfort in your own skin. PJGB is an acronym for the word Pajamagbada, which is one of the brands signature creations. The word is a combination between Pajama + Agbada, merging two distinct items of clothing together to create a new wave. Pajama is defined as a loose usually two-piece lightweight suit designed especially for sleeping or lounging, and Agbada a traditional item of clothing from the Yoruba ethnic group in Nigeria meaning a loose-fitting robe. This specific style represents the beauty of the Yoruba culture, and the beauty of being comfortable in your own skin/home which is generally what the brand represents. Most items in this collection will feature a similar cultural connection, but all pieces will ultimately represent comfort. Consumers of this brand enjoy lounging round the house, watching a great show and entertaining family or friends, while feeling luxurious, relaxed and comfortable at the same time. PJGB strives to give customers the comfort and flexibility to find personal peace through loungewear that is made just for you.</p>
<p>As I embark on the product development phase, I am thankful for the community around me that is able to support my journey. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am seeking $10,000 in order to develop this brand from the ground up, work with the right partners and ensure I am to launch quality items. In order to properly develop an apparel brand, there a are few key steps that are required to proceed, and all of these steps require capital:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brand development and brand design</li>
<li>Apparel ideation, research, and design (digital designs)</li>
<li>Fabric sourcing- I will need to work with various fabric mills and sourcing partners to find the best fabrics for my designs</li>
<li>Pattern making- In sewing and fashion design, a pattern is the template from which the parts of a garment are traced onto fabric before being cut out and assembled. This will allow us to create the blueprint the final items, and there is a $200-$600 cost for each individual pattern made, and I will need 7-10 patterns created. Costs vary depending on the intricacy of the design</li>
<li>Product samples and prototype - once I have the patterns made I will be able to get samples made in my desired fabric. There is is a $200-$600 cost for each individual pattern made, and I will need 7-10 samples created. Costs vary depending on the intricacy of the design</li>
<li>Grading Process- needed to build out the different sizes of the designs prior to production . Costs vary</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This contribution will allow me to work with the best partners to develop my designs and create the best samples. </p>
<ul>
<li>Taking the right steps in the product development stage are critical and ensuring the best final product</li>
<li>As a brand manager I am trained in working closely with teams to ensure all elements tie back to the brand guidelines and consumer first insights from the research conducted </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always potential risks and obstacles I may face on the way to achieving my goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>That is why it is important for me to pay attention to detail to ensure that all items not only look nice, but are also functional. Working with the right partners will be the first step in reducing any risks in the functionality of designs</li>
<li>While I am not an expert in all aspects of the product development phase, I plan to work very closely with all external partners to ensure visibility and collaboration at all steps </li>
</ul>
</div><div>

The word is a combination between Pajama + Agbada, merging two distinct items of clothing together to create a new wave. Pajama is defined as a loose usually two-piece lightweight suit designed especially for sleeping or lounging, and Agbada a traditional item of clothing from the Yoruba ethnic group in Nigeria meaning a loose-fitting robe. This specific style represents the beauty of the Yoruba culture, and the beauty of being comfortable in your own skin/home which is generally what the brand represents. Most items in this collection will feature a similar cultural connection, but all pieces will ultimately represent comfort. Consumers of this brand enjoy lounging round the house, watching a great show and entertaining family or friends, while feeling luxurious, relaxed and comfortable at the same time. PJGB strives to give customers the comfort and flexibility to find personal peace through loungewear that is made just for you.
As I embark on the product development phase, I am thankful for the community around me that is able to support my journey. 

What We Need & What You Get
I am seeking $10,000 in order to develop this brand from the ground up, work with the right partners and ensure I am to launch quality items. In order to properly develop an apparel brand, there a are few key steps that are required to proceed, and all of these steps require capital:

Brand development and brand design
Apparel ideation, research, and design (digital designs)
Fabric sourcing- I will need to work with various fabric mills and sourcing partners to find the best fabrics for my designs
Pattern making- In sewing and fashion design, a pattern is the template from which the parts of a garment are traced onto fabric before being cut out and assembled. This will allow us to create the blueprint the final items, and there is a $200-$600 cost for each individual pattern made, and I will need 7-10 patterns created. Costs vary depending on the intricacy of the design
Product samples and prototype - once I have the patterns made I will be able to get samples made in my desired fabric. There is is a $200-$600 cost for each individual pattern made, and I will need 7-10 samples created. Costs vary depending on the intricacy of the design
Grading Process- needed to build out the different sizes of the designs prior to production . Costs vary


The Impact
This contribution will allow me to work with the best partners to develop my designs and create the best samples. 

Taking the right steps in the product development stage are critical and ensuring the best final product
As a brand manager I am trained in working closely with teams to ensure all elements tie back to the brand guidelines and consumer first insights from the research conducted 


Risks & Challenges
There are always potential risks and obstacles I may face on the way to achieving my goal.

That is why it is important for me to pay attention to detail to ensure that all items not only look nice, but are also functional. Working with the right partners will be the first step in reducing any risks in the functionality of designs
While I am not an expert in all aspects of the product development phase, I plan to work very closely with all external partners to ensure visibility and collaboration at all steps

<p><strong>We are dedicated to promoting positivity within the hip-hop genre. </strong></p>
<p><b>How
many clothing brands get celebrity love before they even release an actual
collection? Now that’s hype. Heist Society Clothing has attacked the street
apparel industry with a promotion campaign that includes artists, such as
Common, Snoop Dogg, Tyga, and The Game to give a few notables. Our team which
consists of best friends, Effie Krekos and Nashmil Sadjadi has even bigger plans
now for how to make the brand stick next year, and even 5 years from now. 
We have succeeded in mixing the young and wild lifestyles of Hip-hop and urban
culture with our own hallmarks of positivity and determination in the short
span of a year. </b></p>
<p><b>Hailing
from the Bay Area, we are two strong-minded women who decided to enter the
street wear industry that has always been mostly male-dominated.  With our
attention to detail and keen knowledge of the latest trends, we have created an
entity that allows us to put our twist on street wear like never seen
before.  Additionally, we pride ourselves on the fact that all of our
apparel is MADE IN THE USA hence creating jobs for our fellow Americans. </b></p>
<p><b>Street
wear speaks to a spectrum of subculture in society, specifically hip-hop. The
message that we swear by: conquer what is yours. Take for example, a lot of
companies might just send an email to an artist’s manager, but not us. We are
our own marketing, therefore will use any guerilla-marketing tactics necessary
to get the job done. We stood in front of Snoop Dogg’s tour bus for 10-hours
straight to give an elevator pitch without any bathroom breaks.  After the
pitch, he was sold into representing our brand.  Heist Society represents
stealing a dream and it has become a lifestyle. After the dog father
endorsement of a Rastafarian “Society Tee” went up on Instagram, our social
media account blew up with over 10 thousand new followers. Join our following

<p><b>Starting
a business has been a 10 year dream in the making.  We have dedicated
ourselves and every extra penny to making this business a success. We do feel
that we still need to grow and show the world the rest of our designs. Over 30

our apparel from the other lines is that we use top quality fabrics and inks
for screen prints.  Our customers come back indicating that our products
have remained the same after multiple washes.  They notice the same
vibrancy and note that the clothing is ready to wear out for a night on the

<h2><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h2>
<p>3D Printing allows people to manufacture three dimensional objects, on demand, from designs they create using computer aided design (CAD) software. The benefits of 3D printing are being applied to many industries including heathcare, aerospace, automotive, among many others. The<strong>industry has evolved </strong>to the point where consumers are now buying 3D printed “copies” online and at retail stores. </p>
<p> <a href=""http://3dlt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">3Dlt.com</a> is a 3D template marketplace. Like a stock photo site, we’ve created a marketplace where professional designers, students, companies, and other organizations can sell their designs online. Our powerful search algorithm makes it easy for consumers to find the things they’re interested in. In addition to file download we also offer printing services, online and at retail. </p>
<p>More than just a design marketplace, <a href=""http://3dlt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">3Dlt.com</a> is a <strong>fast track to innovation</strong>. We think our platform and 3D printing can play a role in solving some of the world's big problems. For our first initiative we plan to launch an Innovation Challenge using 3D printing to improve gun safety. </p>
<h3><strong> WE ARE NOT TAKING A STANCE ON GUN OWNERSHIP. </strong></h3>
<p> Somewhere between 70 and 80 million Americans own a total of <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/14/statistics-firearms-industry_n_2303336.html%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">270-300 million guns</a>. Since the FBI began mandating background checks for firearms purchases in 1993, 165 million have been conducted. </p>
<p> In 2010 guns <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsmartgunlaws.org%2Fgun-deaths-and-injuries-statistics%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0y7GRNB52cT8NODPWr_MtZbI2FA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">took the lives</a> of 31,076 people. 73,505 Americans were treated in hospital emergency departments for non-fatal gunshot wounds. Guns were used in 11,078 homicides and 19,302 suicides. Gun-related accidents killed 606 people. More than 75% of guns used in suicide attempts and unintentional injuries of 0-19 year-olds were stored in the residence of the victim, a relative, or a friend. </p>
<p> Beyond injury and death, firearm theft creates even more problems. It has been estimated that over 500,000 firearms are stolen in the USA each year. An increase in gun ownership <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2010%2F06%2F11%2FAR2010061103259.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEH8_TR_fjyv_3NwLanq7LkEkU4eQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">could lead to an increase in burglary</a> - especially as stolen guns are easy to sell quickly and at good prices. </p>
<p> For a number of reasons, including recent events, fear and talk of stricter control, gun sales are at an all-time high. In 2002 the FBI processed 8.5 million background checks. In 2012? 16.5 million. Black Friday 2012 was the busiest single day ever, with over 150,000 checks conducted. </p>
<p>While most of the economy has struggled, the firearms industry has flourished. Since 2008, <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ycharts/2012/11/11/gun-maker-stocks-a-replay-of-the-obama-sales-boom/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">profits are up</a> over 100% at two of the biggest firms, and employment in the sector is up 30%. With the demand, many outlets have sold out of popular models and prices have gone up, driving even more demand. Ammunition sales are also brisk. Winchester’s ammunition sales for instance, have gone up 33% since 2007. In fact, many retailers and eCommerce websites cannot keep popular calibers and brands in-stock. </p>
<p>Then there’s concealed carry. Since the mid-1980’s 49 states have enacted some kind of legislation solidifying their citizen’s rights to carry a concealed firearm in public either without a permit or after obtaining one. Nationally, the <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2012/08/23/what-the-left-wont-tell-you-about-the-boom-in-u-s-gun-sales/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NSSF estimates</a> there are 6.8 million concealed-carry holders today. This is up from about one million in the mid-1980s. </p>
<h2><strong>PROBLEM </strong></h2>
<p>More people (including untrained newbies) are buying guns and they are purchasing and stockpiling more ammunition than they otherwise might. Since they are unable to find ammunition in their local store, they are ordering it online and having it shipped to them (via UPS, FedEx, and other commercial carriers.) This has the potential to alert others to the presence of a gun or create a liability as deliveries can be left without a signature. Beyond that, a growing percentage of the population is legally permitted to carry loaded firearms in public. We believe that together, these things have the potential to exacerbate the gun safety issue...soon. </p>
<h2><strong>RESOLUTION</strong></h2>
<p>Innovations in firearm safety have the potential to save thousands of lives each and every year. Whether you support 2nd Amendment rights or think tougher gun legislation is the answer, <strong>we can all agree that gun safety is vitally important.</strong> More guns and ammo in the hands of more untrained users could lead to more crime, injury and death.</p>
<p>For many reasons <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2012/12/smart_guns_we_have_the_technology_to_make_safer_guns_too_bad_gunmakers_don.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">product innovation in firearm safety has stifled</a>. </p>
<h3><strong>The Innovation Challenge will focus on using 3D printing to develop new products that improve firearm safety. </strong></h3>
<p>What types of firearm safety products could be 3D printed? Gun locks, safety accessories, and ammunition storage all seem like opportunities. Following are two examples of gun safety products that could potentially have a 3D printed component. </p>

<h3><strong>Please note we are not promoting the use of 3D printing to produce guns or gun enhancements. </strong></h3>
<p>The concept of 3D printed firearms is getting lots of press coverage and exposure right now. The eventual availability of 3D printed guns creates an ever greater need for improved gun safety. While some see 3D printing as a problem, we think it can also be part of the solution. All entries in our challenge will be vetted and <strong>only those with potential to improve safety</strong> will be accepted. </p>
<h3><strong>Why focus on innovation in 3D printing? </strong></h3>
<p>We’re promoting a 3D design-first philosophy. 3D printing provides on demand manufacturing, anywhere in the world. It's also a fast track to product innovation. Projects created for 3D printing are generally ready for mass production, when and where it makes sense.</p>
<h3><strong>How will it work? </strong></h3>
<p>We’ll use the money from this crowdfunding campaign to fund a competition among designers to submit designs for 3D printable products that promote firearm safety. We’ll offer different categories (with different sponsors, and have an overall champion). Voting will be split 50/50 between our panel of experts (TBD) and the general public. Vote early and often for your favorite designer. </p>
<h3><strong>Transparency</strong></h3>
<p>We’ll operate the Innovation Challenge in a completely transparent manner. Winners will pay out as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Prize: 25% of crowdfunded total </li>
<li>2nd Place: 15% of crowdfunded total </li>
<li>3rd Place: 5% of crowdfunded total </li>
<li>Honorable Mention: 2.5% of crowdfunded total </li>
<li>Other awards: 2.5% of crowdfunded total </li>
</ul><p>The remaining 50% will be used to market and operate the Innovation Challenge. At the conclusion of the event an expense summary will be published to our website. Any remaining funds will be applied towards a future Innovation Challenge.</p>
<h3><strong>Scalability</strong></h3>
<p>The scalability of the Innovation Challenge will allow us to fulfill our commitment to our investors regardless of whether we raise $100 or $100,000. But the more you invest, the more we can pay our winners. Your dollars drive innovation. As the payout gets bigger the quantity and quality of submissions will likely increase. </p>
<h3><em><strong>What’s in it for Us?</strong> </em></h3>
<p>Designs from the Innovation Challenge will be featured and sold on <a href=""http://3dlt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">3Dlt.com</a>. But more importantly, it's our chance to make the world a better place, one problem at a time.</p>
<h3><em>What’s in it for You as an Investor? </em></h3>
<p>Get cool stuff, foster innovation, and potentially save lives by making the world a safer place. </p>

Winchester’s ammunition sales for instance, have gone up 33% since 2007. In fact, many retailers and eCommerce websites cannot keep popular calibers and brands in-stock. 
Then there’s concealed carry. Since the mid-1980’s 49 states have enacted some kind of legislation solidifying their citizen’s rights to carry a concealed firearm in public either without a permit or after obtaining one. Nationally, the NSSF estimates there are 6.8 million concealed-carry holders today. This is up from about one million in the mid-1980s. 
PROBLEM 
More people (including untrained newbies) are buying guns and they are purchasing and stockpiling more ammunition than they otherwise might. Since they are unable to find ammunition in their local store, they are ordering it online and having it shipped to them (via UPS, FedEx, and other commercial carriers.) This has the potential to alert others to the presence of a gun or create a liability as deliveries can be left without a signature. Beyond that, a growing percentage of the population is legally permitted to carry loaded firearms in public. We believe that together, these things have the potential to exacerbate the gun safety issue...soon. 
RESOLUTION
Innovations in firearm safety have the potential to save thousands of lives each and every year. Whether you support 2nd Amendment rights or think tougher gun legislation is the answer, we can all agree that gun safety is vitally important. More guns and ammo in the hands of more untrained users could lead to more crime, injury and death.
For many reasons product innovation in firearm safety has stifled. 
The Innovation Challenge will focus on using 3D printing to develop new products that improve firearm safety. 
What types of firearm safety products could be 3D printed? Gun locks, safety accessories, and ammunition storage all seem like opportunities. Following are two examples of gun safety products that could potentially have a 3D printed component. 
 Examples: http://www.safetybullet.com/testimonials.html
http://www.tarnhelm.com/magna-trigger/gun/safety/magna1.html 
Please note we are not promoting the use of 3D printing to produce guns or gun enhancements. 
The concept of 3D printed firearms is getting lots of press coverage and exposure right now. The eventual availability of 3D printed guns creates an ever greater need for improved gun safety. While some see 3D printing as a problem, we think it can also be part of the solution. All entries in our challenge will be vetted and only those with potential to improve safety will be accepted. 
Why focus on innovation in 3D printing? 
We’re promoting a 3D design-first philosophy. 3D printing provides on demand manufacturing, anywhere in the world. It's also a fast track to product innovation. Projects created for 3D printing are generally ready for mass production, when and where it makes sense.
How will it work? 
We’ll use the money from this crowdfunding campaign to fund a competition among designers to submit designs for 3D printable products that promote firearm safety. We’ll offer different categories (with different sponsors, and have an overall champion). Voting will be split 50/50 between our panel of experts (TBD) and the general public. Vote early and often for your favorite designer. 
Transparency
We’ll operate the Innovation Challenge in a completely transparent manner. Winners will pay out as follows: 

Grand Prize: 25% of crowdfunded total 
2nd Place: 15% of crowdfunded total 
3rd Place: 5% of crowdfunded total 
Honorable Mention: 2.5% of crowdfunded total 
Other awards: 2.5% of crowdfunded total 
The remaining 50% will be used to market and operate the Innovation Challenge. At the conclusion of the event an expense summary will be published to our website. Any remaining funds will be applied towards a future Innovation Challenge.
Scalability
The scalability of the Innovation Challenge will allow us to fulfill our commitment to our investors regardless of whether we raise $100 or $100,000. But the more you invest, the more we can pay our winners. Your dollars drive innovation. As the payout gets bigger the quantity and quality of submissions will likely increase. 
What’s in it for Us? 
Designs from the Innovation Challenge will be featured and sold on 3Dlt.com. But more importantly, it's our chance to make the world a better place, one problem at a time.
What’s in it for You as an Investor? 
Get cool stuff, foster innovation, and potentially save lives by making the world a safer place.

<p><b>Welcome to my Selah by Shenaye Indiegogo!</b></p>
<p><b>Big thanks to the Indiegogo community!!</b> We are seeking funding for my newly launched clothing label Selah by Shenaye. </p>
<p>I’ve found that getting dressed can be a huge hassle for us women, and we often dread doing it. We all want to look like the stylish bloggers, but oftentimes don’t end up looking like how we want. That’s where Selah comes in. A line full of basic, staple pieces that are easy to build upon for any outfit. A line that fully enhances a woman's sexy curves, not the lines and flaws we don't want seen.  A line where there's a perfect piece for everyone. A line that makes you feel like the IT girl, because you are.It's about simplicity, sexiness and details. Confidence, quality, and ease.</p>
<p>This is our big chance to make our mark in a growing industry. Dream it Big! </p>
<p><b>There is plenty of work behind the scenes when creating beautiful imagery for a clothing line.</b> Hair stylists, make-up artists, photographers, art directors, mentors, and friends. Those people that help fill the gap when you fully realize you just can't do alone. We are so grateful. Right now both me and my amazing mentor Priscilla Barroso have spent that past months finalizing the designs for the line from every detail down to the buttons. We need your help to produce a full size run to sell on our website. Your contributions will help Selah by Shenaye with all necessary start up costs including the costs of manufacturing, producing a Spring fashion show, our Spring 2014 Lookbook, and the absolute potential to expand this dream to a full out reality! Our ultimate goal in the future is to be able to take part of our profits and start a charity to help fund designers dreaming to produce their own collection. ""It is not about competition, it is about the community.""</p>
<p><b>You might ask why $8,000?</b> It is a pretty exact number when calculating funds needed for the launch. The costs of manufacturing a full size run is about 3,000, not including extra sizing going towards rewards :) (and all the extra sweet gifts!) + producing a strong promotional plan (including a fashion show) + creating the “Support Your Local Dreamer” charity. Selah by Shenaye Indiegogo will allow us to gain exposure in the retail world, crucial for sales and growth, and ultimately help other designers to do the same. </p>
<p><b>A little about me as a designer....From San Antonio to Rhode Island. The story comes full circle. </b>During my time away at school, I study Fashion Merchandising + Retail Marketing at Johnson &amp; Wales University. While at school I started a fashion blog and YouTube channel geared to helping young women like myself learn how to style themselves and feel confident. After receiving messages and comments from my viewers saying how much I helped them, I knew I wanted to do more. I knew I had to create a line of clothing that would further push what I taught in my blog posts and videos. I wanted to help women feel as trendy as a blogger without all the hassle and stress in getting dressed. My one drawback is that I’m a horrible sketcher and my sewing still needs a lot of work, however, I had a vision. I refused to let my “drawbacks” stop me. I took this issue and reached out to a designer that I’d been following for three years. This designer, Priscilla Barroso, has been quite successful in her career thus far, and was even on a TV show called NBC Star. I was surprised when she responded in such depth to my questions and even offered to help me create my vision.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">The Baseball cap reinvented. Contribute and grab one of the awesome perks in the right column. Part of the proceeds will be donated to the Canadian Cancer Society. </span></h3>
<p>TCaps has invented and patented the TCap which is the first and only complete integration of sunglasses into a baseball cap. The advantages and uses are many as is shown in the video and on the web site. The TCap has been blessed with very positive feedback from many different sources and we now need to capitalize upon those reactions to bring the TCap to the next level. </p>
<p><img alt=""Guys and girl with white TCap"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/920171/pictures/original/20130709171502-TopHeader-Option-4.jpg?1373415301"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""TCaps features"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/926327/pictures/original/20130712123352-TCaps-specs.jpg?1373657635"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Next level:</strong> the company needs to enter into a partnership agreement with a company able to market and distribute the TCaps to a broader audience.</p>
<p>We have received strong interest from a few entities, especially in the promotional world, provided we can supply them with enough stock of sunglasses and in return they will provide the hat part of the TCap in equal quantities, assemble the two parts together, warehouse and market them. One company in particular has already committed to this deal if we create a 20,000 pcs stock of sunglasses. </p>
<p>Their reasoning, validated by our due diligence, is that customers in the promotional world need to receive their orders in a very timely manner and we therefore need to have enough product in stock to satisfy that need. </p>
<p>The promotional world is also very price sensitive. The only way we can bring our pricing down to the required level is to order enough stock to begin with. </p>
<p>Your contribution is crucial to allow TCaps to succeed in accomplishing those two key tasks.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To accomplish our goals to get into this partnership and into the lucrative promotional industry, we have estimated our needs at US$50,000.00 to allow us to produce the sunglasses moulds and necessary stock.</p>
<p>Nascar has also shown interest in the TCap but while they like the current product, they would prefer to have us produce a new sunglasses design. So this is a great opportunity for us to get into that promising market which could open many other doors for us. </p>
<p><img alt=""TCaps in action"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/921649/pictures/original/20130710102911-TCaps_in_action.jpg?1373477357"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Should we fall short of the entire goal, we will just produce as many sunglasses as the funds allow us so that we can at least initiate some form of partnership with one of those promotional companies.</p>
<p>You can be among the first to get your hands on your own TCap by helping us. See more details in the Perks column on the right.</p>

TCaps has invented and patented the TCap which is the first and only complete integration of sunglasses into a baseball cap. The advantages and uses are many as is shown in the video and on the web site. The TCap has been blessed with very positive feedback from many different sources and we now need to capitalize upon those reactions to bring the TCap to the next level. 

 

 
Next level: the company needs to enter into a partnership agreement with a company able to market and distribute the TCaps to a broader audience.
We have received strong interest from a few entities, especially in the promotional world, provided we can supply them with enough stock of sunglasses and in return they will provide the hat part of the TCap in equal quantities, assemble the two parts together, warehouse and market them. One company in particular has already committed to this deal if we create a 20,000 pcs stock of sunglasses. 
Their reasoning, validated by our due diligence, is that customers in the promotional world need to receive their orders in a very timely manner and we therefore need to have enough product in stock to satisfy that need. 
The promotional world is also very price sensitive. The only way we can bring our pricing down to the required level is to order enough stock to begin with. 
Your contribution is crucial to allow TCaps to succeed in accomplishing those two key tasks.



What We Need & What You Get
To accomplish our goals to get into this partnership and into the lucrative promotional industry, we have estimated our needs at US$50,000.00 to allow us to produce the sunglasses moulds and necessary stock.
Nascar has also shown interest in the TCap but while they like the current product, they would prefer to have us produce a new sunglasses design. So this is a great opportunity for us to get into that promising market which could open many other doors for us. 

Should we fall short of the entire goal, we will just produce as many sunglasses as the funds allow us so that we can at least initiate some form of partnership with one of those promotional companies.
You can be among the first to get your hands on your own TCap by helping us. See more details in the Perks column on the right.



The Impact from your help
Your contribution will help us to not only break into the huge promotional market 

BUT...
.... will further help us open the doors to the many other channels available to the TCap, such as:

<h3>Athaya Vintage - A Timeless Timepieces</h3>
<div>
<p>My passion for timepieces started when I was a young boy. I still remember, as a little 9 year old, saving my money for several months just so I could buy my first watch. After finally saving enough to buy it, you couldn’t get that watch off my wrist.<br/></p>
<p>Many years later, in 2010, now a man with a family, my passion for watches was rekindled after finding some interesting watch forums. On these forums, I followed fascinating discussions on all kinds of different watches, but I was especially fascinated by threads on how to build your own watch. These forums started to change my whole point of view on watches. Everyday my passion grew stronger and before I knew it, I had collected many different watches.<br/></p>
<p>As I got deeper into customizing, modding and building watches for myself, I started thinking to myself ""Why don't I start producing watch parts?"" Not long after that, in 2011, I began selling watch parts for vintage watches.  Things were going well with my watch parts business, but then a new idea started creeping into my mind to the point where I couldn’t ignore it any longer: ""Why don't I start my own watch brand?"" I resolved to myself that before the end of 2014 I would release my own brand of watches. And, like that, “Athaya Vintage” was born.  I chose that name for two reasons: Athaya is my username on watch forums, and, more importantly, Athaya is also my son’s name.<br/></p>
<p>My biggest hope for Athaya Vintage is to enrich everybody's passion for watches by creating timeless timepieces now, tomorrow and forever.</p>
<br/><p></p>
</div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Help up realize our Watch Project....<br/>
</h3>Athaya Vintage Watch specializes in creating watches based on the greatest vintage watch masterpieces ever made. My first project was the AV001 Type B Pilot Watch. It is based on the vintage WW2 Pilot Watch FL23883. This project generated a great deal of interest with vintage watch collectors and has been very successful. This success has laid a strong foundation for me to continue on to my next project: The Athaya Vintage AV002 Lamafa Diver Watch.<br/> <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Athaya Vintage - Lamafa Diver Watch<br/>
</h3>This diver watch is based on the legendary 6105-8110 diver watch, considered by many to be one of the best divers ever made. The name ‘Lamafa’ refers to Whalers from the eastern part of my country, Indonesia. I chose this name to honor them and their struggle to keep their traditions alive.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130111/files/20150104012033-av002_006.jpg?1420363233"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b><br/>The Movement....<br/></b>The AV002 Lamafa diver watch is powered by a Seiko NH35A automatic movement that has 24 Jewels, 21,600 Vibrations Per Hour, a Power Reserve 41 hours, and Hacking Feature. This movement is one of Seiko’s best movements and has a proven track record of excellent performance in the watch industry.<b><br/></b>

</div></div>","Athaya Vintage - A Timeless Timepieces

My passion for timepieces started when I was a young boy. I still remember, as a little 9 year old, saving my money for several months just so I could buy my first watch. After finally saving enough to buy it, you couldn’t get that watch off my wrist.
Many years later, in 2010, now a man with a family, my passion for watches was rekindled after finding some interesting watch forums. On these forums, I followed fascinating discussions on all kinds of different watches, but I was especially fascinated by threads on how to build your own watch. These forums started to change my whole point of view on watches. Everyday my passion grew stronger and before I knew it, I had collected many different watches.
As I got deeper into customizing, modding and building watches for myself, I started thinking to myself ""Why don't I start producing watch parts?"" Not long after that, in 2011, I began selling watch parts for vintage watches.  Things were going well with my watch parts business, but then a new idea started creeping into my mind to the point where I couldn’t ignore it any longer: ""Why don't I start my own watch brand?"" I resolved to myself that before the end of 2014 I would release my own brand of watches. And, like that, “Athaya Vintage” was born.  I chose that name for two reasons: Athaya is my username on watch forums, and, more importantly, Athaya is also my son’s name.
My biggest hope for Athaya Vintage is to enrich everybody's passion for watches by creating timeless timepieces now, tomorrow and forever.


   Help up realize our Watch Project....
Athaya Vintage Watch specializes in creating watches based on the greatest vintage watch masterpieces ever made. My first project was the AV001 Type B Pilot Watch. It is based on the vintage WW2 Pilot Watch FL23883. This project generated a great deal of interest with vintage watch collectors and has been very successful. This success has laid a strong foundation for me to continue on to my next project: The Athaya Vintage AV002 Lamafa Diver Watch. 
  Athaya Vintage - Lamafa Diver Watch
This diver watch is based on the legendary 6105-8110 diver watch, considered by many to be one of the best divers ever made. The name ‘Lamafa’ refers to Whalers from the eastern part of my country, Indonesia. I chose this name to honor them and their struggle to keep their traditions alive.
The Movement....The AV002 Lamafa diver watch is powered by a Seiko NH35A automatic movement that has 24 Jewels, 21,600 Vibrations Per Hour, a Power Reserve 41 hours, and Hacking Feature. This movement is one of Seiko’s best movements and has a proven track record of excellent performance in the watch industry.

The Lamafa will be available in 2 colors with 2 style options per each color, the available combinations are:

Black insert and Black sunburst dial with Date and Black rubber strap.
Black insert and Black sunburst dial without Date and Black rubber strap.
Blue insert and Blue sunburst dial with Date and Blue rubber strap.
Blue insert and Blue sunburst dial without Date and Blue rubber strap.





Watch will be produce in limited 500pcs only, which will devide 125pcs for each styles.
Each color variant, Black & Blue, will also have their own special caseback engraving.  The black color variant will have an engraving that shows a Lamafa struggling with a Whale.  The Blue color variant will have an engraving of a Lamafa alone, in flight with his spear.


The Luminova....Swiss C1 Luminova will be used on dial indices, hands and Bezel 12H pip. Swiss C1 Luminova will give a pure white color in daylight and very bright Luminova color in dark.

Beautiful Rubber Strap to match with the divers passions...In keeping with the spirit of a pure diver, each Lamafa will come standard with a beautiful rubber diving strap.

Each watch will come with a beautiful Handmade Leather Watch Pouch, which will come in very handy when travelling to exotic diving locations.

<br/><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THE BRAND</b></p>
<p>Inspired by East Indian traditions and style, Haati Chai encompasses both bold and simplistic designs.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To be worn as an extension of your personality, Haati Chai 一 literally meaning “elephant” and “tea” in </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Bengali 一 encourages its wearers to think outside the box. Layers, chunky statements, and delicate </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">designs can be combined to make the perfect look for anyone 一 men included. Contemporary meets </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">tribal, Haati Chai is a blend of culture with elegant designs that cannot simply be defined as jewelry.</span></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<p><b>THE DESIGNER</b></p>
<p>Haati Chai designer Stella Simona takes inspiration from her East Indian culture, merging tribal influence <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">with contemporary designs. Growing up, Stella’s grandma would return home to India &amp; Bangladesh for </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the summer or winter and would ask Stella to send a list of what she wanted from her travels. To begin, it</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">was always little trinkets or jewelry, but as Stella grew older her grandma suggested she should draw the </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">designs she wanted. Their family jewelry smith would then bring the designs to life. From these humble </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">beginnings, eventually, Haati Chai was created.</span></p>
<p>With the understanding that art and design have a personal effect on our daily lives, Stella Simona creates <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">her pieces to make bold statements of individuality. In her native culture, each piece of jewelry represents </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">something personal and is passed down from generation to generation. Each piece tells a story and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">marks different moments of your journey throughout life. Every collection designed at Haati Chai has been </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">made with the idea of offering something which can be a part of one’s story 一 YOUR story. Mixing </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">everyday function with a touch of exotic sensuality, the detail in the designs help you escape to different </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">places or moments.</span></p>
<p>Majoring in communications, Stella gained extensive industry experience with internship opportunities <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">working in sales showrooms, PR, assistant styling, and ultimately landing a position working in artist </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">development where she helped brand and rebrand artists from labels such as Sony and RCA records. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Being in different facets of the industry, she was never truly satisfied with the aesthetic of the jewelry used </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">in the projects she worked on. Expressing this to her close friends and family, they pushed her to take </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">matters into her own hands. Shortly after releasing her first set of designs, Stella Simona received great </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">feedback from around the world. Her custom designs began selling out immediately and received </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">features from blogs from the likes of THEY ALL HATE US. Celebrity stylist friends began reaching out as </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">well for placements and within the first month of launching Haati Chai was featured on Xfactor</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">UK.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Almost 4 years into its life, Haati Chai continues to rapidly expand as well as gain further global <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">recognition. Celebrities from the likes of Demi Lovato and Ashley Tisdale, to Kylie Jenner, Lana del Rey </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and Victoria’s Secret models Jasmine Tookes and Candice Swanepoel have all been seen and featured </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">wearing Haati Chai. Jhene Aiko performed at the 2014 BET Awards head-to-toe </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">in custom-made </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Haati</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Chai pieces, which won rave reviews from viewers who demanded they be available for sale. Featured in </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">magazines across the world from Cosmopolitan Mexico, Vogue Australia, People Style Watch and sold in </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">retailers such as Free People, AISHTI , and boasting a collection of boutique retailers from U.S. extending </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to the Middle East and Australia , the designs transcend all barriers 一 cultural and fashion alike</span></p>
<br/>The ultimate purpose of this line is to embrace the idea of culture. Over the years the major harms, tribulations societies have had to face is from people being inadequately educated on whats going on around them. There are less than 3,000 elephants left in the world. Poaching and enslaving these animals into circuses has been quickly killing the species among other factors. The populations, particularly younger generations, in the regions these animals live lack much knowledge on how precious these animals are to earth. Together the potential bond they can build is destroyed with ideas such as $20000 poaching rewards in South Africa, where they reward people for poaching since it helps clear lands.  By supporting Haati Chai we’re moving one step closer to being proactive .  The ultimate goal of this brand and each collection within the brand is to grow knowledge within the individual. Each piece they purchase comes with a story and when you purchase a piece it becomes apart of your story. This story is pretty grand, and you will be apart of our journey. </div><div>We want to create a sanctuary for elephants and children, particularly orphaned elephants and children, where we raise awareness and  create a safe haven for them. Together the elephants will live with orphaned children of the region where the sanctuary will be located. In third world countries where care for the less fortunate is very rare, an orphaned child faces an unbearable struggle - financially, emotionally, physically. </div><div>
<p>Terror, rage and stress, unfortunately, are also commonplace in the elephant repertoire of emotions. Terror afflicts baby African elephants who wake up screaming in the middle of the night after they have witnessed their families murdered and poached — a type of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>
<p>Some researchers suggest a species-wide trauma is taking place in wild elephant populations. They say that elephants are suffering from a form of chronic stress after sustaining decades of killings and habitat loss. The recent surge in cases of wild elephant rage reported by the media is a sad indicator of the kind of stress that wild elephants are undergoing. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The elephants and orphans will create a bond to serve as an example to the rest of the world, in addition help heal one another.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By giving to this cause you will recreate the idea of fashion and trend. The origins of jewelry indicate pieces that were made were of qualities that would hold a story and be passed on from generation to generation. That idea rarely exists today. A specific piece may indicate someone is married, or a loved one passed away, or an accomplishment. Our goal is to grow this brand through recognition on fashion and retail platforms financially. The faster we grow the closer we will be to our ultimate goal -- helping the orphaned children &amp; elephants.

Inspired by East Indian traditions and style, Haati Chai encompasses both bold and simplistic designs.To be worn as an extension of your personality, Haati Chai 一 literally meaning “elephant” and “tea” in Bengali 一 encourages its wearers to think outside the box. Layers, chunky statements, and delicate designs can be combined to make the perfect look for anyone 一 men included. Contemporary meets tribal, Haati Chai is a blend of culture with elegant designs that cannot simply be defined as jewelry.


THE DESIGNER
Haati Chai designer Stella Simona takes inspiration from her East Indian culture, merging tribal influence with contemporary designs. Growing up, Stella’s grandma would return home to India & Bangladesh for the summer or winter and would ask Stella to send a list of what she wanted from her travels. To begin, itwas always little trinkets or jewelry, but as Stella grew older her grandma suggested she should draw the designs she wanted. Their family jewelry smith would then bring the designs to life. From these humble beginnings, eventually, Haati Chai was created.
With the understanding that art and design have a personal effect on our daily lives, Stella Simona creates her pieces to make bold statements of individuality. In her native culture, each piece of jewelry represents something personal and is passed down from generation to generation. Each piece tells a story and marks different moments of your journey throughout life. Every collection designed at Haati Chai has been made with the idea of offering something which can be a part of one’s story 一 YOUR story. Mixing everyday function with a touch of exotic sensuality, the detail in the designs help you escape to different places or moments.
Majoring in communications, Stella gained extensive industry experience with internship opportunities working in sales showrooms, PR, assistant styling, and ultimately landing a position working in artist development where she helped brand and rebrand artists from labels such as Sony and RCA records. Being in different facets of the industry, she was never truly satisfied with the aesthetic of the jewelry used in the projects she worked on. Expressing this to her close friends and family, they pushed her to take matters into her own hands. Shortly after releasing her first set of designs, Stella Simona received great feedback from around the world. Her custom designs began selling out immediately and received features from blogs from the likes of THEY ALL HATE US. Celebrity stylist friends began reaching out as well for placements and within the first month of launching Haati Chai was featured on XfactorUK.

Almost 4 years into its life, Haati Chai continues to rapidly expand as well as gain further global recognition. Celebrities from the likes of Demi Lovato and Ashley Tisdale, to Kylie Jenner, Lana del Rey and Victoria’s Secret models Jasmine Tookes and Candice Swanepoel have all been seen and featured wearing Haati Chai. Jhene Aiko performed at the 2014 BET Awards head-to-toe in custom-made HaatiChai pieces, which won rave reviews from viewers who demanded they be available for sale. Featured in magazines across the world from Cosmopolitan Mexico, Vogue Australia, People Style Watch and sold in retailers such as Free People, AISHTI , and boasting a collection of boutique retailers from U.S. extending to the Middle East and Australia , the designs transcend all barriers 一 cultural and fashion alike
The ultimate purpose of this line is to embrace the idea of culture. Over the years the major harms, tribulations societies have had to face is from people being inadequately educated on whats going on around them. There are less than 3,000 elephants left in the world. Poaching and enslaving these animals into circuses has been quickly killing the species among other factors. The populations, particularly younger generations, in the regions these animals live lack much knowledge on how precious these animals are to earth. Together the potential bond they can build is destroyed with ideas such as $20000 poaching rewards in South Africa, where they reward people for poaching since it helps clear lands.  By supporting Haati Chai we’re moving one step closer to being proactive .  The ultimate goal of this brand and each collection within the brand is to grow knowledge within the individual. Each piece they purchase comes with a story and when you purchase a piece it becomes apart of your story. This story is pretty grand, and you will be apart of our journey. We want to create a sanctuary for elephants and children, particularly orphaned elephants and children, where we raise awareness and  create a safe haven for them. Together the elephants will live with orphaned children of the region where the sanctuary will be located. In third world countries where care for the less fortunate is very rare, an orphaned child faces an unbearable struggle - financially, emotionally, physically. 
Terror, rage and stress, unfortunately, are also commonplace in the elephant repertoire of emotions. Terror afflicts baby African elephants who wake up screaming in the middle of the night after they have witnessed their families murdered and poached — a type of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Some researchers suggest a species-wide trauma is taking place in wild elephant populations. They say that elephants are suffering from a form of chronic stress after sustaining decades of killings and habitat loss. The recent surge in cases of wild elephant rage reported by the media is a sad indicator of the kind of stress that wild elephants are undergoing. The elephants and orphans will create a bond to serve as an example to the rest of the world, in addition help heal one another.

By giving to this cause you will recreate the idea of fashion and trend. The origins of jewelry indicate pieces that were made were of qualities that would hold a story and be passed on from generation to generation. That idea rarely exists today. A specific piece may indicate someone is married, or a loved one passed away, or an accomplishment. Our goal is to grow this brand through recognition on fashion and retail platforms financially. The faster we grow the closer we will be to our ultimate goal -- helping the orphaned children & elephants. Furthermore the success of this project can prove By giving to this cause you will recreate the idea of fashion and trend.

A huge change in someones live can be simplified by the purchase of jewelry, donation, or additionally the word of mouth. Furthermore this project can serve as an example that a big change is possible one step at a time.

Realistically more than $100,000 will be needed. We are simply asking for startup costs to kickstart this project. In the next year we want to participate globally in trade shows, it will allow us to circle the world with our message and product among powerful individuals.

We listened to your needs and we delivered!  For starters, we got rid of the inconvenient Velcro strap and replaced it with our patent-pending EziFit™ technology.  The 360° compression mechanism provides better tactility and second-skin comfort, while the double spandex splits make putting on and removing the glove a breeze. Lightweight and breathable materials ensure dryer hands for a more comfortable and enjoyable experience all day long.  In fact, FALKO Airlite is infinitely more breathable than traditional cabretta leather golf gloves.   ActiGrip™ technology is a unique leather embossing pattern reducing the effort required for a firm grip in dry as well as wet conditions.  Based on our tests, FALKO Airlite requires half the force compared to traditional golf glove made of standard cabretta leather.  We replaced the traditional cabretta leather with a more robust buffalo leather on the palm which is 2x times more resilient than cabretta of the same thickness.    The touchscreen hotspot on the thumb allows you to use your phone conveniently while keeping gloves on. Unlike large sportswear brands with complex infrastructure and high overheads, FALKO gloves are brought to you directly from our trusted manufacturer cutting the middleman, which means you get a higher quality product at a better value for money. While we enjoy playing glove, we find a similar joy by giving to the more needy. In association with the homeless centers in Europe and the USA, we donate a pair of cold-isolating gloves with every purchase of a FALKO glove.      To get the best experience out of your glove, it's important that you select the right size.

<p><strong>The Superellipse</strong> is a premium automatic watch at an accessible price point. Its unique and unorthodox design is highly provocative and is destined to polarize opinions. Its name is inspired by the superellipse curve, which is the mathematical representation of the iconic cushion shape.</p>

Designed and engineered in Singapore. 
Seiko NH35A movement. 
41 mm wide, 11.9 mm thick, 50 mm lug-to-lug.

We have created a soft organic mat, which can easily be removed and washed (via velcro strips on the back) - or folded away if needed. The Stroller Bag supports parents by clicking on to the Stroller handlebars via the Velcro Straps (and easy off), ensuring fast and easy access to phone, drinks, wipes and a dummy while on tour with your child.      By 6 months your baby is not only on formula/breast, but also in need of further calories from food.  At this stage, you need both a place to change your child and a bag for all the snacks and drinks you need to bring on an excursion. Here the stroller bags adaptability comes in handy. Simply leave the Stroller Velcro Strips on the handlebars, take the Stroller Bag inside with you and fill with Food/Drinks & Snacks as needed. You can then either add the Cross Body strap to the Stroller Bag, or re-attach it to your Stroller Velcro clips depending on your needs. ""All-In-One"" THORSBRENNER Bag, fits all components; Stroller Bag, Removable Changing Mat, Velcro Strips, Dummy holder, Clutch for full flexibility as your child grows.As your child grows and becomes more independent, your need for backup clothes, food, drinks, etc., becomes less apparent. Your child starts being able to eat ""normal"" foods, less drool, and more regular/frequent bathroom breaks.  At this stage, we recommend transferring the Clutch with parents essentials to the front of the Stroller Bag and add the folded Organic Removable mat inside. With less need for backup clothes and a floor being a safer place to change an ever moving Toddler, you can safely fold away your large changing station for longer/weekend excursions, and transform the Stroller Bag to your everyday bag. All in all, the THORSBRENNER Bag allows for full flexibility throughout your child's diaper time.FUNCTIONAL SCANDINAVIAN DESIGN The Design is simplistic and unisex. We don't think Baby products necessarily need to be baby pink or blue. Therefore our Bag comes in Black, Army Green or Burgundy Red. EASY NAVIGATION ICONSWe have inserted icons, that not only make it easier to find what you are looking for, but also function as a check-list at home of what to remember to bring when you go out. DUMMY HOLDERIt's always a debated topic whether to give your child a dummy or not. However, to those who choose to give a dummy (or those children who accept a dummy), it's essential to ensure you always have one with you. Finding the right dummy can be tough to start with, ensuring it's always clean and within reach is another. The THORSBRENNER Dummy holder easily clips on to both Changing Station, Stroller Bag or even Stroller Velcro Strips or Clutch, ensuring it's always within easy sanitary reach.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Take a look around your desk at work, or around your home.
You try to surround yourself with nice things, things that say something about
you. You want to show them off, and you want people to find them just as
pleasing as you do... and that's the same for your gadgets. We buy gadgets that

the millions <i>(billions?)</i> of dollars in R&amp;D to make those things pretty..</p>

<p><i>Wait, what? An accessory for an accessory?</i></p>
<p>Yep, you know that little brick of plastic you got with your
shiny New G Watch? How disappointing... the watch sits on this brick, flat on

There.</p>
<p>The Moduul uses the G Watch charger brick to turn something
plastic, into something gorgeous, and a lot more functional.</p>

<p>We’re paying for the materials in this first mass production

<br/> <b>SITUATION ANALYSIS</b><br/><br/>Millions
of frustrated riders worldwide long for a truly distinctive motorcycle
helmet.<span>  Something that’s new, unique, and
revolutionary.  Something personalized,
fashionable, and functional.  Something
for the 21</span>st Century.<span>  <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/814941/files/20140826221046-Sturgis.jpg?1409116246"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<br/>For years these riders had to
settle for unimaginative, basic shell designs with lackluster paint schemes and
stickers.  But things are about to change
in a drastic way, thanks to </span>Wild Helmets’ ground-breaking
vision.  Many riders
personalize their gear by adding old generation, ornamental accessories (mohawk strips, skins,
airbrushed patterns, stickers, etc.) in a crude attempt to express their
individualism.<span> </span><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/837740/files/20140905210345-mohawk.jpg?1409976225"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<span>But none of the
aftermarket garnishes quite hit the mark, much to the aggravation of the rider.  The root of the problem lies not with paints
or patterns but with the plain shape of the helmet itself.  That’s where we come in!  <br/><br/></span><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/814844/files/20140826211636-tikes.JPG?1409112996"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></span>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>MARKET POTENTIAL</b></p>
<p>Wild Helmets will forever change how motorcycle helmets are
made.<span>  A true watershed moment  for the motorcycle community at large.  By fusing technology and creativity, we’ve
solved countless problems that have dogged riders for years.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/820067/files/20140828224657-RR.jpg?1409291217"" src="""" style=""""/><span> </span></p>
<p>We’ll achieve this
dominance by completely altering the outer helmet shell into distinctive, safe,
iconic 3D themes that riders of all ages will line up for.<span>  Smart helmets with patented, archetypical
images and shapes that speak to the heart and soul of rebels everywhere.  And for those true mavericks who demand a
hands-on approach… they’ll have endless choices of colors, patterns, and
accessories to choose from by designing their own gear on our website.  In the years to come, we envision an entire
global sub-culture dedicated to our brand, loyal collectors and clubs who will
form around our ever-expanding, cutting edge themes.  <br/></span></p>

<b><span><br/></span></b><p><b><span>FAQ<br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>There are several ""Smart"" helmets currently on the market.  How is yours different from theirs?  <br/></span></b></p>
<p><span>Our vision and emphasis has ALWAYS been about iconic designs.  Our patent proves that.  We believe that having a realistic Demon Skull helmet &amp; suit or an infamous movie villain helmet &amp; suit with 3D contours, shapes, and textures that's DOT/ECE approved would be more popular than anything the market has ever produced.  With or without ""smart"" components like Bluetooth and HUDs.  We will, of course, offer BOTH options in our ever expanding product line for those who wish to have the ""Ultimate 21st Century Riding Gear.""  </span><b><span>  <br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span><b>So you're saying you'll offer Themed helmets without the ""Smart"" component then?</b></span></b></p>
<p><span>Yes.  Six are currently being offered at the same, low introductory price of $750.  Our chief goal, at Wild Helmets, is to provide you with every conceivable choice that we can possibly think of.  Whether having smart components or not, to bejeweled helmets and/or suits, LED covered helmets (w/different or same color lights) and fiber optic laced suits to show off on night rides, licensed gear and so on... etc., etc.  But we can't possibly think of everything so if we missed something rad, please chime in.  If we use your suggestion(s), you could qualify for royalties for the duration of the product's run!  We want and need your input.  Good or bad.  We welcome it.  After all, we're a community of kickass personalities.  From the 1%ers to the tutu wearing moped cuties.  Brothers &amp; sisters alike.  All we ask is not to be offensive.  We won't tolerate that.    </span><b><span>   <br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Why are your helmets so expensive?</span></b></p>
<p><b><span> </span></b><span>All new products when launched are expensive.  Especially if 
they're revolutionary.  The costs of Research &amp; Development 
(R&amp;D) are considerably higher when your product(s) push the 
envelope and challenge the status quo.  The perfect example is Apple Computers and their product line.  New methods and materials might have to be employed to guarantee safety without losing our design aesthetics.  Not to mention other ancillary costs such as hiring top notch engineers, conceptual designers, manufacturing facilities for both helmets and suits, creating multiple helmet molds and prototypes of our six helmets for testing.  Once our brand goes mainstream and catches on, we'll produce in bulk... which in turn will lower the unit costs for everyone considered.      </span><b><span>          <br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>What are the horns of your helmets made out of?  And how are they fastened to the helmet? </span></b></p>
<p><span>The horns will be made out of hard, painted rubber and will break away for safety in case of a fall.  They're fastened with pre-sunk 3/8"" screws on the base of each horn and will be screwed in flush into a the helmet's tapped holes.  In the near future, you'll be able to choose different horn sizes, shapes and colors by going onto our website and creating your own unique vision - designing a ""one off"" that'll surely turn heads.  </span><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<b><span>Do you really believe ""The Big Boys"" will grant you their licensing rights to their iconic properties and trademarks?</span></b> <span><br/><br/>It might take some convincing but we're confident that they will.  Much will depend on you, our soon-to-be loyal fan base, and how quickly you can turn our brand into a phenomenon.  If they see that we're the new ""it"" company, we're positive they'll immediately partner up with us to bring you your favorite pop culture characters and beyond.  We can't wait to see all of you out there in different gear.  Regardless of whomever your favorite team or character is!  And as previously stated, this gear will also be available for other sports too!  Like junior BMX-ers for example.  <br/>     </span><b><span><br/></span></b>
<p><b><span>How soon can we expect to have licensed gear?</span></b></p>
<p><span>Again, this will solely depend on you.  If you show them your enthusiasm by buying our products in record numbers, they'll see there's a huge market there and it could happen in short order.  We could theoretically launch our licensed branch division simultaneously to our original concept line.  So 2015 if all goes well.   <br/></span></p>
<p><b><span>How big will your helmets be compared to the standard helmets currently on the market? <br/></span></b></p>
<p><span>Some of our helmets, like the Demon Skull, will be slightly larger due to thicker layers needed for safety and design aesthetics but should fall between the 4-5 lbs range.  So not much heavier than what's currently out there now.    </span><b><span>  <br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Will you make helmets &amp; suits for kids?</span></b></p>
<p><span>Yes.  Click our ""Junior's"" perks and place an order, specifying size(s).  We can't wait to see their over-the-top reactions when they open up their gift boxes and find their gear inside.  We hope you, mom or dad, will send us a picture or video of that precious moment so we may post it on our site.    </span><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Are you planning on producing other themed helmets for Cruisers and Dirt Bikes?  If so, when? <br/></span></b></p>
<p><span>Yes.  We're currently designing several wicked models (and suits), so standby.  It won't be long and you won't be disappointed.  We promise!</span><b><span></span></b></p>
<p><b><span><b>Will you do any Beta Testing?  And if so, how can I become a tester?<br/></b></span></b></p>
<p><span>We're currently on the fence on that one.  If we do decide on testing, we'll post </span><span>our criteria</span><span> on our ""wild-helmets.com"" website, Facebook (wildhelmets) &amp; Tumblr (wildhelmets.tumblr.com) pages.  So </span><span>standby hopefuls and </span><span>make sure to like us on FB and follow us on Tumblr.  You just might get your shot at a free helmet.  </span><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Will you offer sponsorships?  And if so, how can I get sponsored by you?  <br/></span></b></p>
<p><span>Yes and it'll depend on you.  Like &amp; Follow us on our various media pages (FB, Tumblr and our site) and send us a letter, include ur pix, telling us who you are and why you believe we should sponsor you.  It'll be a BIG plus if you're an organized competitive racer...regardless if you're a tyke in training wheels or a Semi-Pro.  Our only criteria is that you're a rebel at heart.  Fearless, brave, and always striving for excellence.  Someone who'll do our brand justice.  Someone who always wants to win in the right way and makes it happen.    </span><b><span><br/></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>When can we expect Themed Helmets for other sports like cycling, skate &amp; snowboarding, etc.?</span></b></p>
<p>We're currently designing several cool models, 
so standby.  It won't be long and you won't be disappointed.  We 
promise!<br/><b><span></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Is riding visibility diminished due to your ""eye socket"" helmet design?</span></b></p>
<p><span>No.  They are other helmets and goggles currently on the market that utilize the eye-socket design.  If fact, motorcyclists have been using goggles before helmets were invented.</span><b><br/><span> </span></b></p>

</div><br/></div>","THEMED HELMETS?  IT'S ABOUT FREAKING TIME!
It's time to bring the 100-year-old motorcycle helmet design into the 21st Century.  With high-pressure injected molding, exotic materials and high-tech components, we'll transform uncomfortable, bland plastic shells into radically Wild, themed-based smart helmets and suits that will capture the world's imagination.    
 In addition to our original, archetypical themes, we'll also secure blue chip licensing partners to ensure the growth and success of the company... providing you a galaxy of endless choices of some of the most beloved, iconic characters in pop culture history.  And our vision is to expand our patented designs to other sports and age groups -- e.g. cycling, skate & snowboarding, skydiving...you name it.           
OUR PROTOTYPES
OUR PATENT













 SITUATION ANALYSISMillions
of frustrated riders worldwide long for a truly distinctive motorcycle
helmet.  Something that’s new, unique, and
revolutionary.  Something personalized,
fashionable, and functional.  Something
for the 21st Century.  
For years these riders had to
settle for unimaginative, basic shell designs with lackluster paint schemes and
stickers.  But things are about to change
in a drastic way, thanks to Wild Helmets’ ground-breaking
vision.  Many riders
personalize their gear by adding old generation, ornamental accessories (mohawk strips, skins,
airbrushed patterns, stickers, etc.) in a crude attempt to express their
individualism. 

But none of the
aftermarket garnishes quite hit the mark, much to the aggravation of the rider.  The root of the problem lies not with paints
or patterns but with the plain shape of the helmet itself.  That’s where we come in!  

MARKET POTENTIAL
Wild Helmets will forever change how motorcycle helmets are
made.  A true watershed moment  for the motorcycle community at large.  By fusing technology and creativity, we’ve
solved countless problems that have dogged riders for years.
 
We’ll achieve this
dominance by completely altering the outer helmet shell into distinctive, safe,
iconic 3D themes that riders of all ages will line up for.  Smart helmets with patented, archetypical
images and shapes that speak to the heart and soul of rebels everywhere.  And for those true mavericks who demand a
hands-on approach… they’ll have endless choices of colors, patterns, and
accessories to choose from by designing their own gear on our website.  In the years to come, we envision an entire
global sub-culture dedicated to our brand, loyal collectors and clubs who will
form around our ever-expanding, cutting edge themes.  



LICENSING



To guarantee a larger
market share, we must immediately secure strategic alliances and introduce new
or existing product lines via professional endorsers.


By far the best
selling tool will be the “cool factor"" of being or seeing your favorite movie villain or comic book superhero.  Or perhaps you'd like to show your love for your favorite sports franchise with licensed logo gear.  You will blow away ordinary motorists, pedestrians, and competitors alike on every track, trail, slope, street or highway in
the world. 


        
CONSUMER PROFILE


Ultimately, Wild Helmets’ demographic will encompass the majority of global
riders.  The young and old alike who
yearn to express their inner child and individualism.  The ones who enjoy attention and fancy
themselves on the cutting edge of new, super cool products. 


Our product line is
in the “lifestyle” category.  We’ll pursue the motorcycle
community (cruisers, off-roaders, ATV, super and sportbikes, mopeds, snowmobilers, etc.), by putting them ALL
in our crosshairs.  Those brave souls who
tame their mechanical beasts daily.  The
true diehards of the motorcycle culture – nearly 10 million strong in the U.S. –
200 million plus worldwide.

FAQ
There are several ""Smart"" helmets currently on the market.  How is yours different from theirs?  
Our vision and emphasis has ALWAYS been about iconic designs.  Our patent proves that.  We believe that having a realistic Demon Skull helmet & suit or an infamous movie villain helmet & suit with 3D contours, shapes, and textures that's DOT/ECE approved would be more popular than anything the market has ever produced.  With or without ""smart"" components like Bluetooth and HUDs.  We will, of course, offer BOTH options in our ever expanding product line for those who wish to have the ""Ultimate 21st Century Riding Gear.""

My last Fall collection ""JENOVA"" has garnered press attention from the likes of the British editions of Vogue and Glamour, as well as making me the first recipient of the Nancy Mak Award. This incredible honor allows me the opportunity to showcase my Spring 2015 collection at MQ Vienna Fashion Week in Vienna, Austria. The magnitude of this opportunity is not lost on me, and I am working extremely hard towards my goal of becoming a presence on the international fashion stage.What We Need & What You GetIn order to make this happen I'm looking to raise $4000. This will cover costs such as:

Airfare to and from Vancouver and Vienna.
Accommodations in Vienna.
Fabrics to produce the collection, including trims such as buttons, zippers, thread etc.
In return for your generous contribution, I've put together a perk list ranging from a social media shout-out to a custom gown!The ImpactYour contribution will help support local designers here in Vancouver and help show the global fashion community that the Canadian market is full of talent. I don't like to just show clothing, I like to immerse the ""Evan Clayton"" client in a wondrous world without limits in self expression. It's that kind of positive energy that I want to see more of in the world, and the opportunity to bring that energy to an audience on a global scale is something that I'm truly passionate about.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease spread the word!

Your custome jackets will arrive before you know it!Questions? We're happy to help. Email us!Our original Adv3nture Hoodie campaign raised $2M in crowdfunding. Now we're back with four new jackets, with 23+ functions and innovations that make traveling easier. The Adv3nture Jackets fold up into full-sized travel pillow, have beverage holders, and other features that you'll wonder how you lived with out.Here's what others have had to say about our products!   At Adv3nture, we pride ourselves on making on the BEST garments in the HIGHEST QUALITY. Our products are durable, and are built to make traveling and exploring more enjoyable. But they're so comfortable, you'll want to wear them every day. Indiegogo backers will enjoy discounted jackets + free shipping in the US + jackets before anyone else!  When traveling, it's tough to be able to pick two or three jackets that will work in any weather you'll experience in your travels. That's why our garments work with each other. When you combine them, you get the benefits of both!  Our garments are meticulously designed and manufactured to ensure that they enhance your journey, whether you're traveling around the corner or around the world. We are dedicated to making premium garments that are durable and comfortable. Your Adv3nture Jackets are perfect for any season, and will be the perfect companion on your trip. But, they are destined to be your go-to jackets for every day use. PILLOW CONVERSION One of our coolest innovations is the pillow conversion. Adv3nture created the first hoodie/jacket to covert into pillows, and we are very excited about our new-and-improved pillow conversion.  All of our hoodie and jackets convert into pillows in the same way-- with a microfleece-lined inside pocket, that turns into a microfleece pillow. Watch this video to see how easy it is to convert our Glacier Parka into a full-sized travel pillow. Imagine using your Adv3nture pillow on a flight, as a passenger in a car, or staring up at the stars! It's SO comfortable! VOYAGEURS HOODIE Previously known by over 15,000 backers as the Adv3nture Hoodie, the new Voyageurs Hoodie still offers 23+ pockets and features along with our updated quality of fabric, overlock stitching, zippers, pillow conversion, and an updated beverage opener. The Voyageurs Hoodie is the world's most comfortable and versatile hoodie. It easily zips and secures into the Wind Cave Windbreaker and the Glacier Parka.  BADLANDS FLEECE Named for Badlands National Park, this is a sophisticated full-zip fleece jacket. With many of the same features of the Voyageurs Hoodie, it zips and secures into the Wind Cave Windbreaker and the Glacier Parka.The Badlands Fleece offers you a stylish and functional option wherever where your plans take you. Strategically placed quilted patches offer abrasion resistance on shoulders for backpack straps, and elbow for commuting and working at your desk.  WIND CAVE WINDBREAKER The Wind Cave Windbreaker is a waterproof shell that had taped seams and waterproof zippers. Either of the inner layers zip and secure into the windbreaker, making it waterproof and warm.  GLACIER PARKA The Glacier Parka is a premium winter jacket with 10 pockets and a faux fur collar. It's perfect for winter hikes, walking around the city, and it's durable enough for hitting the slopes. With either of the base layers (Voyageurs Hoodie or Badlands Fleece) zipped in, it is rated to sub-zero temperatures. THE OVER 23 FEATURES Each of our inner and outer layers comes with a bevy of incredible features. The objective was to make something that performs great, where the innovations where seamlessly integrated into the garment, so it also looks great.   BOTTLE OPENERAll of our garments come with built-in ""emergency"" bottle openers. They are clipped into the passport pocket, but can also be clipped into the paracord in the side pockets.  WE PLANT THREE TREESWith every purchase of an Adv3nture product, we plant three trees. We have created a tree program whereby we plant three indigenous trees in areas of the US that have been affected by forest fires and deforestation. We work with arborists and environmental scientists to ensure that the trees that we're planting are the best for the location that we'll be planting. Every product backed in this campaign will have three trees planted in the US.  NATIONAL PARKSWe want to encourage people to get outside, and disconnect from the digital world so they can reconnect with the natural world. We're as passionate about the environment as we are with making the best possible products. So, we have named our garments after US National Parks. Our Voyageur (French for Traveler) Hoodie is named for the national park in northern Minnesota. The Badlands Fleece is in honor of one of South Dakota national parks. The Wind Cave Rainbreaker is named after one of the longest caves in the world, also located in South Dakota. The Glacier Parka is named for Montana's northern most national park where the temperature often dip far below zero. THE A-(Adv3nture)TEAM! ZANE LAMPREY is the founder of Adv3nture. He has spent more than a decade as the host of of travel shows on National Geographic Channel, Travel Channel & Food Network. He used his design degree to created original garments, beginning with the Drinking Jacket (a hoodie with various features) including the first beverage pocket and bottle opener zipper in 2012. Desiring to create the world’s best traveling companion, he released the Adv3nture Hoodie in 2016, which became the most successful fashion Kickstarter ever. With the success of the Kickstarter, Zane formed Adv3nture, LLC and surrounded himself with talented people to help grow the Adv3nture brand.While traveling the world, Zane saw things that solidified his concern for the world’s natural habitats.

Last year, we finally found a supplier who produces the quality and workmanship we were looking for, with experience with major labels in Australia and New Zealand. After extensive research, factory trips overseas, and perfecting samples, we discovered the perfect fabrics and worked out our final designs for our opening collection.</p><p>We designed every item to fit together as a balanced silhouette. Our pants have a ""carrot"" fit with a relaxed rise, and our T-shirts, sweaters and coats are slightly elongated to meet mid way on the pant zipper to balance the upper and lower body. A carrot fit means that the upper legs until just past the knees are slightly baggier than the traditional slim jean, going slim from the knee to the ankle. The relaxed rise slightly lowers the crotch of the pants to meet perfectly with the length of our t's and sweaters. </p><p>The fabric is just as important as the fit as we want our pieces to not only be comfortable - we want them to last.</p><p>We hope that with this campaign we give you some quality staples, as well as help fund our Spring/Summer ‘19 line.  This includes our website, photography, and sampling costs. </p><p>To start we are offering a package with a crew neck, hoodie and 2 t's - details of each are below.</p><p>Hoodie - We chose a brushed 100% cotton for the hoodie. Brushing the cotton during the processing stage, before weaving, removes the short strands of cotton. This process mitigates balling of the material and ensures the sweater will maintain a soft feel. The sweater wears slightly elongated with a hidden front pocket design.

Last year, we finally found a supplier who produces the quality and workmanship we were looking for, with experience with major labels in Australia and New Zealand. After extensive research, factory trips overseas, and perfecting samples, we discovered the perfect fabrics and worked out our final designs for our opening collection.We designed every item to fit together as a balanced silhouette. Our pants have a ""carrot"" fit with a relaxed rise, and our T-shirts, sweaters and coats are slightly elongated to meet mid way on the pant zipper to balance the upper and lower body. A carrot fit means that the upper legs until just past the knees are slightly baggier than the traditional slim jean, going slim from the knee to the ankle. The relaxed rise slightly lowers the crotch of the pants to meet perfectly with the length of our t's and sweaters. The fabric is just as important as the fit as we want our pieces to not only be comfortable - we want them to last.We hope that with this campaign we give you some quality staples, as well as help fund our Spring/Summer ‘19 line.  This includes our website, photography, and sampling costs. To start we are offering a package with a crew neck, hoodie and 2 t's - details of each are below.Hoodie - We chose a brushed 100% cotton for the hoodie. Brushing the cotton during the processing stage, before weaving, removes the short strands of cotton. This process mitigates balling of the material and ensures the sweater will maintain a soft feel. The sweater wears slightly elongated with a hidden front pocket design. Currently offered in black, navy and grey.Crew Neck - For the crew neck we chose a lighter weight brushed 100% cotton. Similarly, we elongated the sweater to fit slightly longer than a traditional crew neck. Currently offered in black, navy and green.T- Shirts - We chose a double weaved brushed 100% cotton. A double weaved cotton created a tighter and softer finish to the fabric while maintaining the feel of a traditional cotton.

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have come up with an innovative sylish and stealth way of carrying a tobacco pipe.</p>
<p>Through months of design, redesign, and testing we have developed our final prototype. <strong>The Buckle Puffer </strong>is machined from solid blocks of <strong>6061 Aluminum</strong>, and then nickel plated in an FDA approved facility. The industrial hard <strong>Nickel plating</strong> gives the Buckle Puffer a bright shine, long lasting durability, and provides safety when smoking out of. The Buckle Puffer was designed with functionality and style in mind.  Two precisely offset <strong>N</strong><strong>eodymium magnets</strong> (the strongest magnets on the market) are used to create a constant pull on the pipe producing a tight rattle free seal. In addition to the pull of these magnets, we've designed a latching system that operates off of these same magnetic fields. The pipe can only be ejected when the magnetic powered release button is pressed. Unlike latches powered by unreliable springs, the magnetically powered latch is designed to last a lifetime. </p>
