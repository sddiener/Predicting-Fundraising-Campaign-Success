<li>You pre-order a ladibird now</li>
<li>We deliver on June 30, 2014</li>
<li>If Apple releases iPhone 5S/5C at the end of 2013 </li>
<li>And you buy an iPhone 5S/5C</li>
<li>Please inform us immediately</li>
<li><strong>We will ship you a ladibird that fits your iPhone 5S by June 30, 2014 (or Sept 30, 2014, if you buy a middle or late bird)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As for iPhone 6, it is expected to be released in June 2015. iPhones are released usually on an 18-month cycle period. Our plan is to eventually match that cycle period as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""can't make it"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/tAcFGm0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We will continue this project even if we do not reach our US$20,000 Indiegogo goal. </strong></li>
<li>Your money is kept separate from us developers and reserved purely for end-stage manufacturing. We are NOT using your pledge money to build any prototypes, travel expenses, salaries, etc. </li>
<li>In the event we encounter an unforeseen technological bottleneck and ladibird cannot be completed, <strong>we will refund you your pledge. </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""ladibird design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/y1b9exc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The heart of the ladibird is the CMOS image sensor, which is the key component of all digital cameras. </p>
<p><strong><img alt=""sensor comparisons"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/X2UlqmJ.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The ladibird uses a <strong>mirrorless image sensor that is 7.5x bigger than your smartphone's camera sensor.</strong> This larger size gives the following benefits: </p>
<ul>
<li>Higher resolution pictures with far greater detail and sharpness</li>
<li>Increased sensitivity to low-light making it ideal for both indoor and night shoots</li>
</ul>
<p>This sensor is only one half of the ladibird; the other half is our 50mm f/1.8 prime lens (35mm equivalent).<img alt=""50mm lens"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/oLgvyzK.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The main goal of the ladibird - to capture pictures of people with shallow depth of field or the blurred background a technique often used in cinematography or classic noir Hollywood photos.</p>
<p><strong>In short, the ladibird take a picture that truly focuses on you!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""guy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/xiuzWy1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Ladibird's 50mm (35mm equivalent) large aperture prime lens also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absorbs more light, allowing for natural lighting shots without flash</li>
<li>Captures richer, vibrant colours in photos</li>
<li>Has minimal distortion, thus your jaws, cheeks, chin and hips remain slim unlike photos of wide angle lenses such as smartphones and compact camera. <strong>You don't look fat - the camera just has the wrong lens for you!</strong>
</li>

<h2><strong><img alt=""FAQ"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/DNPMV1k.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h2>
<p><strong>1) The ladibird is only for iPhone 5 and onwards?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, primarily due to 2 main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the introduction of the iPhone 5, Apple changed the 30-pin port that used to be on the older models to the newer Lightning port.</li>
<li>We needed to consider manufacturing volume issues involved in keeping compatibility with the iPhone form factor upgrade cycle. In view of this factor, we are starting with iPhone 5 model onwards.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Photos from such a big sensor would be quite large, in terms of megabytes. Will they be compressed before sharing out?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, as the iPhone itself and several other apps compress images prior to sending them out.</li>
<li>The ladibird app will incorporate compression algorithms as well.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Will you be able to transmit the ladibird's images to the iphone separately through wireless tech such as WiFi or Bluetooth?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will look at these possibilities but the ladibird is currently designed to transmit through the Lightning port only.</li>
<li>Any form of wireless connectivity to will be an added feature, we are currently concentrating our efforts on ensuring ladibird works as a whole together with your iPhone 5. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>4) Can the ladibird record video? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes. Since the mid-2000s, most image sensors in consumer products such as ladibird can record video.</li>
<li>We will update you on ladibird's video format, resolution, FPS and bit depth in future.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5) What is the megapixel count of the ladibird?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We cannot reveal the megapixel count as yet due to NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement). </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6) What about flash? I don't see a flash anywhere on the ladibird!</strong></p>
<p>Many people actually prefer to take pictures without on-camera flash because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You look extremely washed out and your skin pores become highly visible due to the direct flash.</li>
<li>Your own body casts very harsh shadows into the background, creating areas of darkness in the photo.</li>
<li>Check out OKCupid's study, which finds flash tends to make you 7 years older in photos: <a href=""http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/dont-be-ugly-by-accident/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/dont-be-ugly-by-accident/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are looking into building a flash system that can avoid all of the above. More details will be revealed in future. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>7) Your project is going for 2 rounds of crowdfunding. Why are you doing this and what happens if you cannot finish the project?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We are treating this first round of Indiegogo as a <strong>prototype round.</strong> Our second round of Indiegogo, expected by end of 2013 or Q1 2014, will be the real crowdsourcing event for mass production. </li>
<li>At any stage if we are unable to continue, <strong><em>we will refund you your pledged amount.</em></strong> However the key components have been confirmed, our team is mature (with combined 20 years of working experience) and we also have business continuity plans in place to ensure the project gets completed.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>8) Why are you not on Kickstarter?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kickstarter is open only to American or British citizens, thus we do not qualify.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>9) We are your first backers on Indiegogo. What will you use our money for? </strong></p>
<p>We will use your pledge money to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Manufacture the first production batch.</strong> Your pledge will be kept aside strictly only for the first production batch.<strong> </strong>We will NOT be using your money to build the prototypes.   </li>
<li>
<strong>If you reside in Singapore, Hong Kong or Taipei, you will get also have  a chance to be our beta tester. </strong>We will try to get a balanced pool of beta testers based on gender, age groups and user types such as DSLR owners, Instagrammers, casual smartphone users, bloggers etc. </li>
</ul>
<p>Also, as we want to ensure ladibird is built with your needs in mind, we will occasionally send you a SurveyMonkey (an email survey service) to help us on key development decisions.   </p>
<p><img alt=""surveymonkey"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/DaqhgDL.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>10) How can we verify you are genuinely doing this project?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you're in Singapore, you can find us, talk to us and even drop by to visit us if you wish, we'd be quite happy to have a chat with you. We're a startup kindly housed in the National University of Singapore.</li>
<li>We also have the Made for iPhone (MFi) development license and are ready to work on the base development hardware with our key component manufacturer.</li>
<li>If you're from Taipei, you can also arrange to meet us. All backers will be updated with our travel plans. We will also be collaborating with an institution in Taipei.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are from any other part of the world, you can skype and chat us up on facebook or email us directly. Our timezone is GMT +8.00.</p>

Pre-order yours today!</h3><br/><h3>Koda Lens Protector</h3><p>When it comes to scratched lenses, everybody has a story. Why? Glasses and sunglasses are more than just accessories. Whether you wear a five dollar pair of sunglasses that you found at a gas station in Oklahoma or a custom crafted prescription set made just for you, eyewear is more than just a product: it is a part of daily life. It’s easy to take for granted just how much we rely on our glasses and sunglasses until something happens.</p><br/><p>For some, it’s a world brought to a screeching halt by the headaches and expense of a chipped prescription lens that takes days to replace. For others, it’s a lifetime of buyer’s remorse caused by their first trip to the beach or into the mountains with a brand new pair of $300 shades, only to return with a scratched lens that renders them useless. Whatever your story, the disappointment and frustration caused by a damaged lens will always be the same.</p><br/><p>Let’s face it: life is too tough for a tiny little lens to handle all on its own. There's no relief even if you buy high-end eyewear because there is no difference in durability in the most vulnerable piece: the lens. Koda Lens Protector is on a mission to let you buy the glasses or sunglasses you want without having to wonder if they will last.</p><br/><p>Never scratch again. Koda Lens Protector is a thin, high-tech film applied directly to the lens. It utilizes a patent pending design that conforms perfectly to the topography of the lens and that is simple enough for you to install right at home. Koda Lens Protector leverages a self-healing formula that leaves no residue and is invisible to the wearer, deflecting even the toughest curves life throws at your lenses.</p><br/><p>We are on a mission to #savealltheglasses and will stop at nothing to get there. Contributors have a unique opportunity to be the first to own Koda Lens Protector for any pair of glasses or sunglasses. KLP is also excited to be teaming up with a local charity to bring needed prescription glasses to third-world children through our campaign. If we hit our goals, a pair of prescription glasses will be donated for every Koda Lens Protector ordered.</p><br/><p><b>About Us</b></p><p>Koda Lens Protector (KLP) is the newest evolution in eyewear technology: an ultra-thin, self-healing film created to help defend consumer eyewear against the scratches caused by handling, dropping, or even simply cleaning lenses. The lens protector is placed directly onto the lens with an invisible adhesive and can be manufactured to conform seamlessly to the topography of any lens. Bearing the same industrial strength as high grade smartphone screen protectors with a thinner design, KLP provides aerospace gradedurability made to last as long as the eyewear itself. Application is simple - use the provided spray solution and applicator to seal - and removal is painless, leaving no residue or wear marks behind. KLP is the invisible solution perfect for lens wearers from every walk of life.</p><br/><p>With over 40 supported manufacturers, KLP’s ability to match and protect essentially every model of eyewear on the market gives endless possibilities to this up and coming brand. Manufacturers ranging from sports performance brand Oakley to luxury brands such as Prada and Versace display a wide range of shapes that KLP can accommodate. Everyone from the occasional sunglass wearer to the eyeglass wearer dependent on their lens for vision can benefit from KLP. </p><br/><p>After scratching an expensive pair of sunglasses only days after buying them, founder/inventor Matthew Baker scoured every corner of the internet looking for a product that he could use to prevent future scratches. “There wasn’t anything like this out there,” says Baker. “So I decided just to make it myself.” He left his family company in 2015 and set out to develop KLP as a way to end unnecessary lens damage, allowing those who (like himself) prefer the look and feel of designer eyewear but settle for cheaper options to avoid disappointment. “Nobody should have to pass up the eyewear they want just because they are worried about a scratch,” notes Baker. “And now, thanks to [KLP], they don’t have to.”</p><br/><p>The greatest challenge in bringing his vision to life, Baker says, has been manufacturing. With thousands of variations of sunglasses and eyeglasses, designing a process that would accommodate the wide variety of eyewear on the market proved to be no easy task. Baker experimented with so many production methods he feared that his product would die as nothing more than an idea. It was at this point that he crossed paths with an engineer with extensive manufacturing experience that directed him to the high-tech hardware and advanced computer systems needed to not only handle the complex process of producing the lens protector itself, but also provide the flexibility needed to manufacture a wide range of lenses on-demand. </p><br/>KLP has perfected its designs and is in the process of evaluating a shortlist of materials and factories to begin production. To cover the costs of the first production run Baker has launched an Indiegogo campaign with exciting rewards including a lifetime supply of protectors. Pre-order is available now. <p></p><p><br/></p><h3>How Koda Lens Protector Works</h3><p>Those familiar with high-grade smartphone screen protectors will find many parallels in the design and functionality of Koda Lens Protector. The material is of aerospace grade durability and utilizes a self-healing formula to ensure that it will last as long as you keep your glasses or sunglasses. </p><br/><p>Koda Lens Protector has been designed with the end-user in mind since day one. We have carefully crafted our product to be simple enough to install in your own home using the provided spray solution and applicator. The adhesive is fully transparent, providing invisible protection for your lenses.</p><br/><p>So why not just buy a smartphone screen protector and apply it to your lenses yourself? There are two reasons that this will not work (trust us, we tried - this was actually how our initial prototype was born!), the first being the curvature of the lenses, and the second being the thickness of the material.</p><br/><p>While smartphone screen protectors adhere flawlessly to the flat or simple curves of a wraparound smartphone screen, lenses are much more complex. The lens protectors must actually be manufactured specifically to form to the nuances of each specific lens to prevent bubbles and peeling from occuring.</p><br/><p>Koda Lens Protector is also composed of a specially formulated material that is thinner than smartphone screen protectors. Thicker materials extend too far from the surface of the lens, causing them to peel up from the edges over time and collect dirt and debris under the edges (therefore defeating the purpose of the lens protector).</p><br/>We are always happy to answer questions about our product, just drop us a comment in the campaign and we will get back to you right away!<br/><br/><br/><h3>The Budget</h3><p>We are raising $57,000 so we can start the first round of production. The patent and engineering fees have already been paid out of pocket, so the funds will go straight to the materials, equipment, and programming needed to put this into action. The costs of production are heavily front-loaded, as the equipment is advanced and a significant amount of custom programming is required to prepare our lens library for production.</p><p>Once production begins, the ongoing costs are reduced dramatically. From that point forward the bulk of our cost will be the funding of a seamless customer service experience and the expansion of our physical network as we strive to provide local, in-person support to the greatest number of our customers as we can possibly reach.<br/></p><p><b>Stretch Goals</b></p><p>While we can get Koda Lens Protector off the ground if we hit our funding goals, it will take a lot more to fulfill our mission to #savealltheglasses. The more funds we are able to raise, the more lenses we will be able to keep in our library and support through an expanded physical support network.</p><p>$83,000 - Free Koda Dog Microfiber Cloth for every campaign contributor</p><p>$175,000 - Lifetime warranty included free with every Koda Lens Protector</p><p>$335,000 - Second Koda Lens Protector free for all campaign contributors</p><h3></h3><h3>Perks</h3><p>A 2 year unlimited warranty is included with any purchase of KLP (unless we are able to hit our $175,000 stretch goal, which will automatically upgrade all KLP purchasers to a lifetime warranty).<br/></p><p><img alt=""Koda Dog LOGO.png"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xAWWmB4xrfOFzpWr5C0RrzjA8orWEgr3T9qP7yltITTRxY9sW9I7NZ_KZN24574PvjHKk21epqouya5nVP4bvRHDaOkDddwb0eWjjhH2XmWDe32RdH8oJF4e3a2xXOXhiKJ-ELJz"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul>

Please take our quiz at www.kodalensprotector.com/quizIf we don't reach our goal, we will not stop in our quest to bring this vision to life. However, the production costs of Koda Lens Protector are largely front-loaded, meaning that we will have to divert the funds that would have gone to charity and secure additional funds through alternative channels. The most significant impact this will have will be on our timeline - if we fall short of our goal, we will be unable to guarantee that our timeline will stay intact.

TimelineSeptember 2016 - Secure production facility and begin installing equipmentOctober 2016 - Begin programming lens libraryNovember 2016 - Begin test production runs, refine prototypes for productionDecember 2016 - Finalize production modelsJanuary 2016 - Begin productionFebruary 2016 - Begin deliveriesThank you so much for checking us out, and we can’t wait to have you on board! Leave a comment in the campaign or drop us a message if you have any questions.Risks & ChallengesOur lives have been dedicated to this project over the past 18+ months. The curvature of lenses can be very complex (especially with so many different lenses out there), but we have remained committed to finding an efficient, cost-effective way to produce Koda Lens Protector for all of them.Our greatest challenges lie not in producing Koda Lens Protector (anymore), but in building an effective physical support network to provide a local reach to as many of our customers as possible and contribute to an exceptional sales and customer service experience for all of our users. While these functions can be performed remotely through a central facility, our commitment is to providing the most efficient, seamless customer experience possible. This can only be done if we can provide convenient, local access to all of our customers.We know what we need to do - now we just need the funds to put it all in place and press the button to start manufacturing!We will keep you posted on the progress through updates here on Indiegogo.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Back in 2009, I thought that going barefoot would solve my knee pain. It didn’t, but something unexpected happened. Back then, I had made myself sandals to run in but ended up wearing them more than all my other shoes. </p>
<p>I wore them almost every day until they broke. That’s when I decided to buy something similar. This was very frustrating because what I found either felt like cardboard or was bulky or unrefined. So I made my 2nd pair, improving the design and durability. This same story repeats 37 times! </p>
<p>At some point, I had made a pair of sandals for my partner Hanane, and we'd wear them almost everywhere. People were regularly coming up to us on the street asking us where we got them from. It was obvious that there was something special about these sandals. </p>
<p>We began accepting orders and had people buying them across 4 continents. That started a long process of “get real-world feedback, improve, repeat.” With every upgrade, we wanted the best materials so the sandals would be even more comfortable and durable. </p>
<p><b>5 years and 37 tries later, we finally had it right. So right, in fact, that as soon as we sold 50 pairs, a hundred more lined up. With each pair taking us 4 hours to make by hand, we knew we had to find a better way to bring Makus to the world. </b></p>
<p>And that’s why we're here today, reaching out to you. Launching a crowdfunding campaign will help us deliver the unmatched quality, comfort, and design of Maku sandals to you and to the world. </p>

<p><b>William Choukeir. </b>From as far back as he can remember, William has been taking things apart and making things (like his own toys, remote-controlled helicopters, meditation chairs, and clothing). When William is disappointed with products available in the market, it’s quite possible that he’ll try to build his own version. He has high standards and is obsessed with making beautiful industrial-quality consumer objects. By day, William is a designer who helps businesses make things people want. It's this combination that initially brought the 1st pair of Makus to life, and drove their persistent improvement, year after year.</p>
<p><b>David El Achkar. </b>Over the years, David has launched and has helped others launch a variety of businesses. He truly enjoys making things work simply, setting up and optimizing operations, as well as the creativity involved in designing solutions where none were previously available. Early adopter turned co-founder, he joined the Maku team to launch a new brand and setup the infrastructure needed for people all around the world to enjoy what was once limited to a very narrow circle. At his core, David values minimalism, quality, and design. His Makus are the first thing he grabs when leaving home.</p>
<p><b>Hanane Kai. </b>Hanane is an illustrator, maker of picture books, and an occasional award-winner. She's in love with materials and textures; with their tactile and visual qualities. That passion drove her to source the world for materials she can fall in love with, materials that ended up in Maku sandals. Hanane's special ability to know what stirs emotions in people guides the design direction of Maku. Without her, Makus would have never ventured out of our home into the wild. She has spearheaded efforts of getting early versions onto people's feet, collecting feedback, and integrating it into the final product you see here.</p>

5 years and 37 tries later, we finally had it right. So right, in fact, that as soon as we sold 50 pairs, a hundred more lined up. With each pair taking us 4 hours to make by hand, we knew we had to find a better way to bring Makus to the world. 
And that’s why we're here today, reaching out to you. Launching a crowdfunding campaign will help us deliver the unmatched quality, comfort, and design of Maku sandals to you and to the world. 
We love our Makus, and we hope that you want your own Makus as well. Thank you so much for sharing this journey with us!
 
William Choukeir. From as far back as he can remember, William has been taking things apart and making things (like his own toys, remote-controlled helicopters, meditation chairs, and clothing). When William is disappointed with products available in the market, it’s quite possible that he’ll try to build his own version. He has high standards and is obsessed with making beautiful industrial-quality consumer objects. By day, William is a designer who helps businesses make things people want. It's this combination that initially brought the 1st pair of Makus to life, and drove their persistent improvement, year after year.
David El Achkar. Over the years, David has launched and has helped others launch a variety of businesses. He truly enjoys making things work simply, setting up and optimizing operations, as well as the creativity involved in designing solutions where none were previously available. Early adopter turned co-founder, he joined the Maku team to launch a new brand and setup the infrastructure needed for people all around the world to enjoy what was once limited to a very narrow circle. At his core, David values minimalism, quality, and design. His Makus are the first thing he grabs when leaving home.
Hanane Kai. Hanane is an illustrator, maker of picture books, and an occasional award-winner. She's in love with materials and textures; with their tactile and visual qualities. That passion drove her to source the world for materials she can fall in love with, materials that ended up in Maku sandals. Hanane's special ability to know what stirs emotions in people guides the design direction of Maku. Without her, Makus would have never ventured out of our home into the wild. She has spearheaded efforts of getting early versions onto people's feet, collecting feedback, and integrating it into the final product you see here.

clothing for, and inspired by, the Modern Urban Woman, made in the San 
Francisco Bay Area by local artisans.  We are looking for Angels to help us fund  Domina Designs Debut Collection.</p><p>Most ready to wear 
clothing is geared towards women 20 - 35 years old. The biggest error 
they make is that these clothes do not fit real women correctly. By doing that,
 they are ignoring the largest, and fastest growing market, that of 
today's ""Younger"" 35 - 55 year old woman.</p><p>I’ve been experimenting with casual day wear, trying to 
find what works best for me and my busy  life.  What
 I need, is clothing that is comfortable, fits me well, and is easy to take care of.  What I want is clothing that makes 
me feel attractive and ready to tackle the world, without being over 
complicated.  And FUN!   Fun clothing is de rigueur!</p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/654142/files/20140616223026-12107.jpg?1402983026"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>                     <i>- - A sample of the type of knit tops we want to produce - -</i></p><p><i>                                                   - - Not a Final Design - -<br/></i></p><p>So, I was inspired to create a new line of modern, everyday clothing for myself, for REAL women.</p><p>Women like my friends.  Women like myself.  We work.  We travel.   We're super busy.

 I’m Denise Pieracci.  I’m a costume designer from the San Francisco Bay
 Area, experienced in custom made historical clothing and tailored menswear. Recently, I've been inspired to produce a new line of affordable contemporary 
clothing for, and inspired by, the Modern Urban Woman, made in the San 
Francisco Bay Area by local artisans.  We are looking for Angels to help us fund  Domina Designs Debut Collection.Most ready to wear 
clothing is geared towards women 20 - 35 years old. The biggest error 
they make is that these clothes do not fit real women correctly. By doing that,
 they are ignoring the largest, and fastest growing market, that of 
today's ""Younger"" 35 - 55 year old woman.I’ve been experimenting with casual day wear, trying to 
find what works best for me and my busy  life.  What
 I need, is clothing that is comfortable, fits me well, and is easy to take care of.  What I want is clothing that makes 
me feel attractive and ready to tackle the world, without being over 
complicated.  And FUN!   Fun clothing is de rigueur!                     - - A sample of the type of knit tops we want to produce - -                                                   - - Not a Final Design - -So, I was inspired to create a new line of modern, everyday clothing for myself, for REAL women.Women like my friends.  Women like myself.  We work.  We travel.   We're super busy. The Modern Woman doesn't have time to waste stressing over clothes.And
 that’s what I’ve come up with, the perfect go-to clothing for your busy
 day.  Classic styling in modern fabrics.  Easy wear.  Easy care.  Best 
of all, easy elegance.  All at an affordable price.     - - Sample of twin needle finishes and brass rivet embellishments - -And, on top of that, it’s all kissed with the magic of our original artwork.   The key to setting our designs apart from the rest in the market, is that the new Embroidery Machine will enable us to create unique and original textiles, that no one else has. Achieving
 our fundraising goals will enable us to create a real production 
studio, to produce the clothing line locally - instead of using overseas 
contractors, which is a plus for our local economy - and to be able to 
competitively market it.The
 budget covers all Production Costs, hiring Marketing and P/R professionals, a budget for 
hiring local labor for production, and most importantly, new equipment, including a commercial grade, 4 color computerized embroidery machine.    - a sample of the type of artwork that will be used for embroidery patterns -We have a multi-level plan for marketing.  We'll launch retail sales on Etsy, thru my current shop, Satin Shadow Designs, which already has a high profile and increased visibility and traffic.  Once sales of Domina Designs can support it, we'll create it's own shop on Etsy.We will also offer Domina Designs for the wholesale market.  Currently, there are 2 boutiques interested our 
work, and eager to see the new designs.    I’ve made contacts with a few fashion reps who are also
 interested in seeing the new collection samples when they are ready. We welcome finding more Reps or PR people that can help with both the initial launch and ongoing marketing needs.Upon advisement, the final designs will not be made public until the samples are made.  We will document our progress on production, and keep you updated through photos and videos.  To get an idea of fabrics, and patterns and colors, take a sneak peak here, at our ""sample"" website.   https://sites.google.com/site/dominadesigns/Your support means the world to us.  One of the many ways you can show your support is to share this page, and our mission, with your friends.  Post it to Facebook and share it on Twitter.  If you like and believe in what we are doing, chances are other Angels will too.  What Your Contributions Will Provide$  5,000 for fabrics and trims to develop and produce the line$  5,000 for competitive labor wages:

<h3>Who we are</h3>
Chair.i.tee is a women's loungewear brand based in sunny San Diego, California. Using only the highest quality, buttery soft fabrics, we're the proud creators of <strong><em>The Ultimate Feel Good Tee</em>.</strong> With every tee-shirt purchased we donate to women's charities around the world in support of women's rights, health, economic success and overall well being*. <strong>Whether it’s a new mom in Africa who needs a fistula surgery, a widow in India seeking refuge, or a sex trafficking victim in Nepal who needs vocational training, your purchase supports a woman in need.</strong> Wear one of our tees and feel good both inside and out! <strong>All items are 100% USA made.</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>* We will donate 50% of our direct sale proceeds (online sales) and 25% of our wholesale proceeds (boutique sales) to our charities. See detailed info below.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Why tee-shirts?</h3>
I started Chair.i.tee for two reasons:</div>
<div>
<br/>1.) Because I love wearing soft things. And this tee-shirt is so silky soft you’ll want to hug yourself when you wear it. Promise. It also has what I like to call ""eating room."" Meaning you can eat your burrito at lunch, feel uncomfortably bloated, and then still look totally cute and thin when you stand up and walk out the Chipotle door. No belly outlines show with this tee-shirt. That's another promise!</div>
<div>
<br/>2.) I want to help women in need. Be it lack of food, shelter or education, sex trafficking, forced prostitution, or any other kind of physical or emotional abuse, the fact is there are millions of women around the world who desperately need help. Another fact is that women are consumers - especially in the West. We know what we want, and we usually get it. So if we’re going to spend money on things we buy anyway, why shouldn’t it support a good cause?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
So far I've personally invested about $3,000 to cover pre-production costs (business integration/legal fees, pattern making/adjustment costs, sample production costs, etc.). Currently I need about $2,000 in funds to help cover the first round of production (fabric and manufacturing costs, care labels and hang tags, etc.).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Which, thanks to Indiegogo, is where you come in!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>For $35 you’ll get a SOLID WHITE V-NECK Chair.i.tee</strong> (see, it’s not just a brand, it’s a noun!). <strong>You'll also get a Chair.i.tee sticker and a HUGE thank you on our website.</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All tees are made of 95% Siro Micro Modal and 5% Spandex. Siro is a very high end specialty yarn that comes all the way from trees in the Austrian Alps*. This accounts for why our tees are so buttery soft!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each tee will come with a small, soft white satin tag with the Chair.i.tee logo on the front bottom hem (see photo). This tag is called a ""clamp tag"" which means it will fold underneath the tee-shirt. I intentionally selected this tag so that I could insert a special thank you message underneath, so each time you do laundry or take it off you'll be reminded that Chair.i.tee appreciates your support! :)  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The care label will be imprinted on the inside back via heat transfer (see photo). No itchy/scratchy tags here!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What's also neat about our tees is that each one comes with a hang tag (see photo) made of special seed paper. So rather than just cut off and throw away the tag like you would with any other item of clothing, you can pot or plant the tag in the ground and it will grow flowers. (Seriously, it will). Such a fun novelty!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Sizes come in XS, S, M and L.</strong> Our tees run slightly large, so if you prefer a slimmer fit, please order one size down.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>I'd love to have pictures of the completely finished tees, but unfortunately given the logistics of the manufacturing process I'd have to order and pay for all materials (fabric, tags, etc.) before they'll assemlble a 100% finished product, and I just don't have enough to do that yet.</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div> *Yarn is imported, but fabric is milled in Los Angeles.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Additional perks:</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>For $60 you'll get 2 SOLID WHITE V-NECK Chair.i.tees ($5 off each), a Chair.i.tee sticker and a HUGE thank you on our website.</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>For $100 you'll get 4<strong> V-NECK </strong> Chair.i.tees ($10 off each) <strong>in either WHITE or CHARCOAL GRAY- pick whatever color combination you prefer. You'll also receive</strong> two Chair.i.tee stickers and a personalized thank you on our website.  <br/></strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>For $200 you'll get 10<strong> V-NECK </strong>Chair.i.tees ($15 off each) in either WHITE or CHARCOAL GRAY- pick whatever color combination you prefer.  You'll also receive three Chair.i.tee stickers <strong>and a personalized thank you on our website.  </strong></strong></div>
<div><strong><strong> </strong></strong></div>
<div>These would make great birthday or holiday gifts, so buy away!<strong><strong> </strong></strong>I promise you're going to LOVE this tee. We're like the luxurious feel of James Perse basics meets Tom's Shoes humanitarianism. There's a reason we're calling it <em><strong>The Ultimate Feel Good Tee.</strong></em> It truly is.</div>
<div> </div>

<div>What is a fistula?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>""Obstetric fistula is the most devastating and serious of all childbirth injuries. It happens because most mothers in poor countries give birth without any medical help. So many are young girls. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are among the leading causes of death and disability for women of reproductive age in these places. Obstetric fistula was largely eliminated in the United States in the latter part of the 19th century and early 20th century with improved obstetric care in general and the use of c-sections in particular to relieve obstructed labor.
<p>After enduring days of agonizing, obstructed labor a woman's body is literally broken by childbirth. During labor contractions, the baby's head is constantly pushing against the mother’s pelvic bone — causing tissue to die due to lack of blood flow to this area. All of that pushing creates a hole, or in medical terms a ""fistula"", between the birth passage and an internal organ such as the bladder or rectum. A woman cannot hold her urine, and sometimes bowel content as well.</p>
<p>Her baby is unlikely to survive. If she survives, a woman with fistula is likely to be rejected by her husband because of her inability to bear more children and her foul smell. She will be shunned by her community and forced to live an isolated existence. These women suffer profound psychological trauma resulting from their utter loss of status and dignity, in addition to suffering constantly from their physical internal injury."" - <em>Fistula Foundation website</em></p>
<p><strong>Through the ""Love-a-sister"" sponsorship program, Chair.i.tee proceeds will go to pay for fistula surgeries.</strong></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Plus many many more each day - Frogglez is taking the swim goggles market by storm!</span></h3>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>WHY FROGGLEZ? </strong></h2>
<p><img alt=""Advantages"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img689/8849/advantages.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Advantages""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a parent of 3 little kids that now are 9, 7 and 5 years old. I struggled with swim goggles for years trying to find a pair that was <strong>comfortable</strong>, <strong>did not pull hair out</strong> or involved <strong>a battle to get on</strong>. Finally I began making prototypes of what now has evolved into the patent pending <strong>Frogglez Goggles</strong>. My kids have worn these prototypes for over a year now and parents kept asking me where they could get a pair...</p>
<p>Now, the first few prototypes were nothing to write home about - put together with love, sweat and sometimes tears (the kids have been great most of the time :) ), but the final product turned out great! I decided to call the company ""Made By My Dad"" per my kids suggestion.</p>
<p>Frogglez Goggles are swim goggles made out of neoprene (wetsuit material) with a patent pending strap design. This design fits 90% of children between the ages of 3 and 9 very comfortably. There is no need to adjust the swim goggles as they conform to the back of the head and create a snug but not overly tight fit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>we selected the best fitting goggles we could find</strong> after 2 years of trying different types. <strong>Then we tinted them to match the color of the Frogglez strap</strong> <strong>to block some light</strong> for the pink and the blue, and made them a cool gray for the green Frogglez.</p>
<p>We do make Frogglez Goggles in REGULAR and LARGE size, giving you some options for finding the best fit:</p>
<p><strong>REGULAR</strong>: Kids 5/6 and under (head circumference of 19 inches or less)</p>
<p><strong>LARGE</strong>: Kids 6+ (head size 19 inches or more)</p>
<p>If in doubt about which sized would work best for your little ones, wrap a string around their head and measure it!</p>
<p>Frogglez Goggles come in 3 different colors, PINK, GREEN and BLUE. </p>
<p>Frogglez are designed for non-competitive swimmers that simply want a more comfortable, fun and stylish option compared to the archaic, traditional swim goggles.</p>

WHY FROGGLEZ? 

 
I am a parent of 3 little kids that now are 9, 7 and 5 years old. I struggled with swim goggles for years trying to find a pair that was comfortable, did not pull hair out or involved a battle to get on. Finally I began making prototypes of what now has evolved into the patent pending Frogglez Goggles. My kids have worn these prototypes for over a year now and parents kept asking me where they could get a pair...
Now, the first few prototypes were nothing to write home about - put together with love, sweat and sometimes tears (the kids have been great most of the time :) ), but the final product turned out great! I decided to call the company ""Made By My Dad"" per my kids suggestion.
Frogglez Goggles are swim goggles made out of neoprene (wetsuit material) with a patent pending strap design. This design fits 90% of children between the ages of 3 and 9 very comfortably. There is no need to adjust the swim goggles as they conform to the back of the head and create a snug but not overly tight fit.
Furthermore, we selected the best fitting goggles we could find after 2 years of trying different types. Then we tinted them to match the color of the Frogglez strap to block some light for the pink and the blue, and made them a cool gray for the green Frogglez.
We do make Frogglez Goggles in REGULAR and LARGE size, giving you some options for finding the best fit:
REGULAR: Kids 5/6 and under (head circumference of 19 inches or less)
LARGE: Kids 6+ (head size 19 inches or more)
If in doubt about which sized would work best for your little ones, wrap a string around their head and measure it!
Frogglez Goggles come in 3 different colors, PINK, GREEN and BLUE. 
Frogglez are designed for non-competitive swimmers that simply want a more comfortable, fun and stylish option compared to the archaic, traditional swim goggles.
 

 *exact colors will vary slightly
SECOND PLACE ON DAILY GROMMET PITCH - Product Launch Competition!
We were VERY excited when the Daily Grommet (www.DailyGrommet.com) selected Frogglez as a TOP 10 PRODUCT out of over 145 entries which competed at the Daily Grommet LIVE product pitch #grommetpitch in Fenway Park, Boston. You can view our entry here:  http://www.dailygrommet.com/blog/frogglez/ - and we were THRILLED when we got SECOND PLACE (should have been first, but who is counting) :)

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Message from the owner:</b></p>
<p>Dear
potential backers/supporters,</p>
<p>It
has always been my intention to build something greater than myself. Whether
through scholastic achievement, organizational notoriety, or personal
development, I have always yearned to create something that could really
speak to people on a primal and personal level.  Throughout my life, it
has often been easier for my passion and devotion to shine through my actions
rather than my voice.</p>
<p>I
believe that through fashion and the building of a lifestyle brand and
boutique, I can reach people on a personal level and make them feel good about
themselves.  I have talked to countless mentors and professionals in
the industry regarding my business endeavor and feedback has been
overwhelmingly positive.  </p>
<p>To
start a business is to put oneself out in the open for failure and success. I
believe that my education at University of West Florida and Lewis University, my relationships with family and
friends, and other difficult yet rewarding life situations have prepared me to
run this company successfully. With my work in the past, I have acquired the tangible
business, social, and leadership skills I will need to make Primo a massive
success and a company that will really make a difference.</p>

system/cameras, signage, furniture, office supplies, POS systems, and more.
Message from the owner:
Dear
potential backers/supporters,
It
has always been my intention to build something greater than myself. Whether
through scholastic achievement, organizational notoriety, or personal
development, I have always yearned to create something that could really
speak to people on a primal and personal level.  Throughout my life, it
has often been easier for my passion and devotion to shine through my actions
rather than my voice.
I
believe that through fashion and the building of a lifestyle brand and
boutique, I can reach people on a personal level and make them feel good about
themselves.  I have talked to countless mentors and professionals in
the industry regarding my business endeavor and feedback has been
overwhelmingly positive.  
To
start a business is to put oneself out in the open for failure and success. I
believe that my education at University of West Florida and Lewis University, my relationships with family and
friends, and other difficult yet rewarding life situations have prepared me to
run this company successfully. With my work in the past, I have acquired the tangible
business, social, and leadership skills I will need to make Primo a massive
success and a company that will really make a difference.
Thanks
for the support,

The Impact:


 By helping fund this campaign you will be allowing people everywhere the opportunity to own for themselves something which has already become a sought after commodity in the eyes of people who have seen the original Saddlebags I made for myself. Launching my line of Saddlebags is only the beginning, however, and ultimately by contributing to this project, you are watering the seedling of Echowear, a fashion line I envision blossoming much further.


I have been passionately designing and creating wearable art for years and making all sorts of fashion, ranging from everyday clothing to avant garde costumes for performance. I believe in the quality of my work, and my vision and attention to detail has already earned me the success and honor of working as the lead costume designer for an increasingly popular performance group known as Quixotic Fusion.

This technique yields various colours and patterns, which are digitally printed in the UK, using variety of luxurious fabrics. Inspiration is drawn from subcultures, street fashion and issues with an emotional impact. Andreja’s taste for cut and deconstruction perfectly balanced with Maja’s vision of print and textile manipulation. Every season designers like to tell stories in different ways, using ambiguous fabrics, proportion and silhouette. DIORALOP designs are for person that is uncompromising, aware and individual.</p>

Andreja Bistricic and Maja Merlic are the designers behind the creative label DIORALOP. DIORALOP was recently awarded prestigious the Best young designers ELLE Magazine Style Award.
DIORALOP collections are inspired by Polaroid pictures, which were created through intentional spills of chemicals and their exposure to different temperatures. This technique yields various colours and patterns, which are digitally printed in the UK, using variety of luxurious fabrics. Inspiration is drawn from subcultures, street fashion and issues with an emotional impact. Andreja’s taste for cut and deconstruction perfectly balanced with Maja’s vision of print and textile manipulation. Every season designers like to tell stories in different ways, using ambiguous fabrics, proportion and silhouette. DIORALOP designs are for person that is uncompromising, aware and individual.
The Croatian duo met in Zagreb, which lead to the launch of their label. Andreja obtained degree at Faculty of Textile and Technology in Zagreb/Croatia. Graduated from Central St. Martins College of Art and Design in 2009 specializing in womenswear, whilst expanding knowledge interning at Alexander McQueen studio. Maja is an architect, with strong sense of texture and style.

About this project:
And here is the reason why we need your help. We have just got a great offer to showcase our work in Paris, during Paris Fashion Week.  We are self funded brand and since this collection is going international, the costs are higher. 
By pledging to this fund, you will be giving a huge helping hand to DIORALOP brand.   This opportunity is crucial for the label, but with the total production and exhibition costs reaching around 5,000 $ it wont be possible without the help of our supporters and followers. Every cent is a step closer to our goal.

We got frustrated paying hundreds of dollars for name brand sunglasses, knowing they only cost a fraction of the price to make. We have spent all of 2016 working with leaders in the industry to come up with an affordable, stylish looking sunglasses collection that we know everyone will love. Also we have partnered with The Foundation for Blind Children to bring awareness to the cause. $5 off every pair of sunglasses bought through our campaign will be donated to the foundation. Another reason why our lenses are the way they are is to make sure people enjoy what they see. The children at the foundation are not as fortunate as us, thats why we made sure to give back to them. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494955466/x1xmpkkhnk4plibvttvi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>Our Team:</h3><p>Michael Zielinski: Founder &amp; Owner</p><p>Filip Boksa: Investor &amp; CMO</p><p>Matthew Bianchi: Head of manufacturing</p><p>Vivek Prajapati: CTO</p><p> </p><h3>Our Future Plan</h3><p>We want a full line of different types and styled sunglasses that always stay at an affordable cost.

We got frustrated paying hundreds of dollars for name brand sunglasses, knowing they only cost a fraction of the price to make. We have spent all of 2016 working with leaders in the industry to come up with an affordable, stylish looking sunglasses collection that we know everyone will love. Also we have partnered with The Foundation for Blind Children to bring awareness to the cause. $5 off every pair of sunglasses bought through our campaign will be donated to the foundation. Another reason why our lenses are the way they are is to make sure people enjoy what they see. The children at the foundation are not as fortunate as us, thats why we made sure to give back to them.  Our Team:Michael Zielinski: Founder & OwnerFilip Boksa: Investor & CMOMatthew Bianchi: Head of manufacturingVivek Prajapati: CTO Our Future PlanWe want a full line of different types and styled sunglasses that always stay at an affordable cost. We also want to add other items that such as suits, jackets, bags, belts, dress shoes and more that are also luxurious, and also affordable. So join with us on this journey and be a part of it every step of the way. We will send out several updates throughout the entire process making sure our backers are up-to-date on any important information. We want to create a bond with our backers, because ultimately you are the ones turning this dream into a reality.  We are super excited to grow and anxious to see what the future has in store for ZOLENOS. FAQ'SABOUT US:Product Features:SHIPPING & SAFETY:CUSTOMER SERVICE:",36.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is FlossOFur</h3>
<p>Our plant-based insulation, which we’ve coined “FlossOFur”, is made from milkweed floss. Many pollinators nectar on milkweed flowers, but the Monarchs require milkweed leaves to raise their young. Milkweed is disfavored for its problematic nature. We decided to change that narrative and create a plant-based alternative to goose down.</p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate""></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">A pile of dirt on a farmer's land. That's all it was, really. I drove by it and I saw it. I cannot recall the exact day, except that it was somewhere in the fall. Time passed by, the seasons changed. During the winter it was bare, though there were days when it was covered in a blanket of snow. I would still occasionally drive by it and see it. In the spring it woke gently to the warmth of the sun. I would drive by it. And I would see it.<br/>Then came the summer, and it grew lush and full. One Sunday morning, while in a sentimental mood, I didn't simply drive by it. I stopped, I walked onto the land and approached it. And then I photographed it. Two weeks later I drove by the farmer's land again. To my surprise the pile of dirt was gone.<br/><br/>Two years later I read a thirty year old essay by Japanese photographer Yutaka Takanashi, The ""Landscape"" Appears. In it he discusses a haiku by the poet Matsuo Basho, using it as a metaphor for landscape photography. 'What is up to the photographer to do with the ""landscape""', Takanashi writes, 'is to encounter it, destroy it, rebuild it, and then release it.' Therein lies the pursuit of a new ""landscape"", the landscape of the photograph, the landscape of the haiku. One that not only relates an experience, but is an experience. Like Basho's haiku. Maybe that is what The hill that wasn't is about. I had seen the landscape many times, but it was not until that summer morning that I encountered it. And by photographing it and turning it into this book, I destroyed it, rebuilt it and released it.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.stefanvanthuyne.be/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.stefanvanthuyne.be</a></span></p>

During the winter it was bare, though there were days when it was covered in a blanket of snow. I would still occasionally drive by it and see it. In the spring it woke gently to the warmth of the sun. I would drive by it. And I would see it.Then came the summer, and it grew lush and full. One Sunday morning, while in a sentimental mood, I didn't simply drive by it. I stopped, I walked onto the land and approached it. And then I photographed it. Two weeks later I drove by the farmer's land again. To my surprise the pile of dirt was gone.Two years later I read a thirty year old essay by Japanese photographer Yutaka Takanashi, The ""Landscape"" Appears. In it he discusses a haiku by the poet Matsuo Basho, using it as a metaphor for landscape photography. 'What is up to the photographer to do with the ""landscape""', Takanashi writes, 'is to encounter it, destroy it, rebuild it, and then release it.' Therein lies the pursuit of a new ""landscape"", the landscape of the photograph, the landscape of the haiku. One that not only relates an experience, but is an experience. Like Basho's haiku. Maybe that is what The hill that wasn't is about. I had seen the landscape many times, but it was not until that summer morning that I encountered it. And by photographing it and turning it into this book, I destroyed it, rebuilt it and released it.www.stefanvanthuyne.be

is the first and only motorized extendable dog droppings remover that enables you
to pick up dog feces while standing, with no risk of contact, in a few seconds with
the push of a button.</p>
<p>If you own
a dog – and even if you don’t – it is easy to understand that to pick up dog excrement
is not the most pleasant thing to do. Of course, leaving it on the street is
even worse.</p>
<p>Existing
tools, such as clamps, bags, and similar items can help; nevertheless, they cannot
prevent you from bending, using your hands, and maybe feeling some bad
sensations. Moreover, the elderly can find stooping to be painful, and children
can be at risk of disease through contact with excrement.</p>
<p>We thought
there must be a better way - and thus invented Pulydog.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr>

<p>Pulydog 2.0

<p>Some dog

<p>Pulydog 2.0

<p></p>
<ul>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">First,

<p>So we had
to decide whether to improve the existing product with some minor adjustments
or to make major changes. We opted for completely revising the project by
reengineering a brand new model, with the same functionality but a dramatic
change in the dimensions and weight.</p>
<p>Thanks to
the experience gained from model 1.0, Pulydog 2.0 can perform the same function
with almost half the length and less than half the weight. That’s an evolution
of:</p>
<h4>- <i>
</i><i>from
16” to 8.5” long, and</i>
</h4>
<h4><i>-<span> 
</span>from
13oz to 6oz <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">(project design calculation – to be confirmed after prototypes tests),</span>
batteries included.</i></h4>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/831029/files/20140903063349-dis_compar_orizz.jpg?1409751229"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>In other
words, Pulydog 2.0 is as long as a common TV remote control, which means you
can easily carry it on your pocket, purse, or bag. When needed, you can extend
it up to 27”, in order to let you comfortably operate while standing. </p>
<p>Furthermore,
while the 1.0 automatically extended and manually retracted, using customer
suggestions we made this the opposite for model 2.0. To avoid any risk of
hurting animals while opening, the new model has to be extended by hand and can
be retracted by pushing a button. Moreover, the new self-closing bag makes it
easier to put on and possibly cheaper in retail price.</p>

Pulydog 2.0
is the first and only motorized extendable dog droppings remover that enables you
to pick up dog feces while standing, with no risk of contact, in a few seconds with
the push of a button.
If you own
a dog – and even if you don’t – it is easy to understand that to pick up dog excrement
is not the most pleasant thing to do. Of course, leaving it on the street is
even worse.
Existing
tools, such as clamps, bags, and similar items can help; nevertheless, they cannot
prevent you from bending, using your hands, and maybe feeling some bad
sensations. Moreover, the elderly can find stooping to be painful, and children
can be at risk of disease through contact with excrement.
We thought
there must be a better way - and thus invented Pulydog.

Pulydog 2.0 lets you
  pick up           dog droppingsin the most comfortable, easy, stylish, and
  hygienically safe way.

ONLY 8.5"" LONG!


                   



Only 8.5” long (like a TV remote control), it is fully portable, and when needed can extend up to 27”.


                                                            






Just place it on the ground and push the button. Driven by paddles, in a few seconds the bag opens and closes around the feces.



                                  





Then, by pushing a second button the Pulydog 2.0 retracts automatically .




                                        


 


The bag has
a self-closing system, and when you unlock it from the paddles it is ready for disposal.
Easy, isn’t it?                                                         



                    





After use,
you can put Pulydog 2.0 in its slipcase and keep it with you in your handbag or
in your pocket.

                                          

It is also equipped with a strap to hang on your wrist or on
the leash.

                                                                      

Pulydog 2.0
is covered by an international patent (n. PCT/IT2013/000186).
Some dog
owners find it unpleasant, embarrassing, or simply uncomfortable to pick up dog
droppings. However, leaving them on the street means not respecting the
environment or other pedestrians. In most towns it also means the risk of a fine.
Pulydog 2.0
can be a bright solution. When needed, it can remove droppings on your behalf
in a few seconds, and does so effortlessly. You just have to push a button and throw
the self-closing bag away. (Waste should be disposed according to local regulations).
Cool, isn’t
it?
Perhaps you
do not have a dog… well, forward this to your friends who do and surprise them!

  portability is not satisfying as it is too long and a little too      heavy




So we had
to decide whether to improve the existing product with some minor adjustments
or to make major changes. We opted for completely revising the project by
reengineering a brand new model, with the same functionality but a dramatic
change in the dimensions and weight.
Thanks to
the experience gained from model 1.0, Pulydog 2.0 can perform the same function
with almost half the length and less than half the weight. That’s an evolution
of:
- 
from
16” to 8.5” long, and

- 
from
13oz to 6oz (project design calculation – to be confirmed after prototypes tests),
batteries included.


In other
words, Pulydog 2.0 is as long as a common TV remote control, which means you
can easily carry it on your pocket, purse, or bag. When needed, you can extend
it up to 27”, in order to let you comfortably operate while standing. 
Furthermore,
while the 1.0 automatically extended and manually retracted, using customer
suggestions we made this the opposite for model 2.0. To avoid any risk of
hurting animals while opening, the new model has to be extended by hand and can
be retracted by pushing a button. Moreover, the new self-closing bag makes it
easier to put on and possibly cheaper in retail price.

Other information on technical data is available
below or on www.pulydog.com. For further questions please feel free to contact
us at info@pulydog.com.
Color
In the first
phase the customer can choose between these three color combinations:
   
        1.
silver/blue              2. orange/black          3. light/dark greenWe want our
backers to be fully satisfied. If you prefer one of the other combinations
below, when contributing you can indicate a second color preference. If we
reach a minimum order number (1,500 pc.) for that color combination we will add
it to those available and will ship your preferred color.
                   4. blue/grey                                   5. dark grey/red                    6. pink/purple                                7.yellow/greenStay tuned
to see the available colors evolution during the campaign and share your color
preference with friends. The more popular your preference becomes the higher
the probability it will be made. 
Please remember
that the full black combination is a specific color special edition, reserved for
the best backers – see the Perks section.The Full Black Limited Edition for Indiegogo CampaignTech Notes


Materials:
most of the components are made of anti-shock, nontoxic plastic material, such
as ABS, POM, and nylon.


Electricity
supply: 2 AA 1.5 volt batteries.


Dimensions
LxWxH: retracted 8.53” x 1.79” x 2.09” (217 x 45 x 53 mm); extended L 27.5”
(701 mm). Dimensions by project design, minor adjustment are possible according
to test results.


Weight
with batteries included: 5.3oz (150 gr) – estimated by project design
calculation.

For further
information please contact us at info@pulydog.com.Use of Funds
The
estimated amount of funds needed is based on the experience of the first model;
therefore, we are reasonably confident that every single activity could be
carried out in time once we attain our target with your support.
The main
cost items and their relative weight of total funds needed are the following:


prototypes
(4%)


functional
and stress tests on prototypes (8%)


design
industrialization adjustment (3%)


pre-series
lot manufacturing (5/7%, included in the following)


dimensional
and stress tests on pre-series lot, type-approvals, certifications (5%)


mold
making and first lot of effective production, including pre-series
manufacturing (60%)


bags,
accessories, and packaging manufacturing (10%)


fund
raising fees, warehouse and logistic costs, other minor costs (10%)

As previously
mentioned, we can count on a network of selected suppliers that will grant us a
good package in terms of quality, affordable service, and competitive prices.
We firmly believe that a good idea cannot
become a success by itself; it needs support from professional skills, good
planning, strong personal commitment, and - most of all - good backers.
We really hope you like our idea as
much as we do. We are ready to start - are you?
Thank you in advance for your support.
TimingThe above
timelines were settled by prudently considering activities, in particular the
tests whose duration depend on punctual results. If no major problems arise,
the timing could be quicker.

However, backers will always be kept aware of the
progress stages of the process. Meet the Pulydog Team

</div><p>Thank you all!</p><p>Team Variant</p></div>","A Different Standard of Affordable Timepieces
 
Variant, by definition means ""Different from the Standard."" 
This is the basis for which our company was formed.           

Simply put, we just love watches and want to create original, high-quality timepieces that are designed with a striking aesthetic and functionality at a reasonable and honest price that reflects the components and materials that have been used. We believe that style and affordability DO NOT need to come at the expense of quality.


Our first collection, the VA-01 series represents everything we love in a versatile everyday watch that can be worn dressed up or down. This collection is Unisex in style and design.

 

*Note - All photos in this project are of the pre-production prototypes of the VA-01. Refer to the notes at the bottom of the project for details on items that will be updated for the production version.

Our original timepieces draw inspiration from other watches we love and would want to wear. We wanted to create a modern watch with a timeless design that is uncluttered, yet visually interesting. Clean in design, but will stand out in the sea of ""minimalist"" clones on the market today.


Unlike many of the ""affordable luxury"" brands on the market today that choose style over substance, we don't believe you need to compromise one over the other. We've packed our VA-01 series with high-end components and features that people usually pay a premium for.




Case: Brushed and Polished Surgical Grade Stainless Steel Plated in Steel, Gold, Rose Gold, Black (PVD Matte)  
Size: 40 mm (48 mm lug to lug) / 20 mm Lug Width / 5 mm Crown / 7.7 mm Thick  
Water Resistant: 100 M / 328 Feet / 10 ATM  
Crystal: Flat Triple Layered Anti-reflective Coated Sapphire Crystal.  
Dial: Applied Indices. C1 (Blue) Lume Applied on Hands and Pips on Reflector Ring. Date Window (3'o clock) and Small Seconds Subdial.  
Movement: Swiss Made Ronda 6004.D Quartz Movement, 5 Jeweled
Battery Life: Renata Swiss Batteries, 25-40 Month Battery Life.  
Strap: Genuine Calf Leather / Stainless Steel Milanese Mesh / Easy Release Pins  
Warranty: 2 years

By offering the VA-01 collection directly via Kickstarter we are able to cut out the retail channel, middlemen markups, brand exclusivity/scarcity, and offer a $450* watch for a fraction of the price.
*What some of these companies below are charging for comparable models

SIMPLY THE BEST ACROSS THE BOARD- In comparison to comparable models
It's ridiculous that some of these companies are marking up their prices up to 100x the value for a subpar or similar product!

 Case
316L Stainless Steel

Brushed and Polished finishes with a signed crown
For the case, we utilized premium surgical grade 316L stainless steel for its strength and corrosion resistance. The mixture of brushed and polished surfaces allow for the premium look and feel of our timepieces. At a 40 mm diameter (48 mm lug to lug), and 7.7 mm thickness, it is the perfect for any wrist!

7.7 mm Thin!
10 ATM Water Resistant

Screw down Case back allows for increased Water Resistance
Most companies are okay with their watches being minimally water resistant with 3-5 ATM being the standard. That's cool, we're not them and believe that it's better to over-engineer our watches than to not. 
All of our timepieces are rated at 10 ATM water resistance, meaning you can go for a swim or even scuba dive in a depth of up to 100 meters or 328 feet without worry. (The leather straps are not water-proof)
Crystal
Sapphire

With a 9.0 on the Mohs scale, the only thing harder is Diamond
Our timepieces are equipped with triple layered anti-reflection coated Sapphire crystal which is one of the most scratch resistant materials available to ensure your view of the dial will always be unobscured and pristine.
Dial

Multi-layered dial with hand applied polished hour markers, along with a unique radial CD cut pattern help give our dial a more premium look. The small seconds subdial adds a bold contrast in the design. The date window at the 3'o clock then completes the functionality of the timepiece. 

Low Light / No Light Functionality!
C1 Superluminova lines the reflector ring as well as the hands to enhance low light to no light functionality.  
Movement
Swiss-Made Quartz
UNLIKE many companies that use lower end movements with plastic components to save on costs, we went with a movement made by Ronda, a Swiss company which has a long track record of creating precise, reliable movements. 
The Swiss-made Ronda caliber 6004.D is a 5 jeweled, gold plated and completely metal movement, meaning it is resilient and fully repairable should anything happen to it.

Swiss-Made Ronda Caliber 6004.D
Why Quartz?
While we definitely love our hand wound and automatic movements, there is something about the ease and efficiency of a good quartz watch. You set it, forget it, and it's good to go. 
-10/+20 secs variation a Month
Whereas some autos -10/+20 secs in variation a Day
Straps

 All straps are 20 mm wide

To keep the price affordable given the materials and level of craftsmanship we are using, we have a minimum number of watches that we need to order, and that's where you come in. By backing our project, you will help us pay for the first production run, and in exchange you will receive a beautiful watch with an impressive spec sheet at a highly discounted price!

 How we're able to offer such affordable prices. 

Cutting out the middlemen to save you money! Heard that before? We're sure you have, but hey, that's the idea! We are trying to offer you the best price without overly marking up a product more than it actually costs us to produce it. Honesty and transparency are very important to us as a company.

 

After over a year of designing, prototyping, revisions, and preparation for this campaign, we are finally at this stage. The plan from here on out will be as follows:   

With our suppliers ready to go, we need your help to place our first purchase order. Your support will go towards helping us bring our dream into reality. 
Thanks again, and please help share this campaign!

Backpacks are a great way to carry your stuff. When you have lots of it. But when you only need your essentials, your 24L pack isn’t going to cut it.

A bag that helps you plan ahead so your phone never runs out of battery. A case that doesn’t sweat it when bad weather hits. All of this, while keeping you looking smooth and suave.

From this bobobark was born.bobobark is a handmade designer piece. A versatile backpack that carries the Parisian chic heritage all the while being comfortable and practical. Most importantly bobobark is completely sustainable!   
 bobobark fits any lifestyle, and any woman on any occasion. Designed with a womans silhouette in mind and to highlight any outfit. On the go or at the office, bobobark will be there to elevate your style.   A clean geometric shape that was designed to match the ergonomic shape of a womans body and to flatter the silhouette.     Our bag is handmade from a premium cork skin which is collected and polished in Portugal, until the texture is as soft and supple as leather.Cork is as resistant and durable as leather but 3 times lighter. It is completely organic & ethical. Collecting and harvesting the bark from the cork tree takes place every 7 to 9 year, and this way does not harm the trees. In fact, this method helps the trees grow and release more oxygen. Our craftsmen pay close attention to every little detail and every piece of the bag is attached individually to guarantee the highest quality. Our bags are made to last.  Handmade from a premium cork skin, resistant and durable  Organization is made simple & easy with bobobark.A clamshell clasp opens 180 degrees for a wide and clear view into the bag. A large zippered pocket at the center acts as a divider of the main compartment. 180º opening for a wide and clear view We added a 13” laptop padded compartment which is accessible both from inside and outside of the bag. An easy access phone pocket for easy reach, and a port built into the pocket for a cable to keep you charged on the go. A few more well thought out zips and pockets allow you to organize your treasures the way you like. Organize your treasures the way you like  
      The Organic Cork material we use is 3 times lighter than leather which allows for added comfort. It is resistant and strong, and is completely waterproof. The more it ages the softer and smoother it becomes. 3 times lighter than leather and waterproof!

THE BEGINNING
The story of SVPER11 watch started in 2016, exactly on November 14th - which was the night of the largest Supermoon in 70 years.

Supermoon is an astronomical event, when the moon gets as close to Earth as possible whilst being in full moon phase.

THE INSPIRATION 
I've spent this sleepless night thinking about how amazing the NASA Moon Landing mission was.
 

Supermoon sparked the idea of an object, that would celebrate one of the most amazing achievement of us as humanity - The NASA Apollo11 Moon Landing Mission.
We wanted to create something, that you could always have with you and  it would remind you that... OH MY GOD! We've actually went to the Moon! :)

The list of to-do’s seems endless, time seems short, yet what we care for and about more often than not keeps adding up. How can we take care of everything and everyone, and do it with style (because style matters)? Our solution became TAG. And why stop with us? We all share this problem and TAG can be our common solution. As a TAG owner, you become one of us – a person who cares!</span><br/>

TAG – THE SMALL SOLUTION TO YOUR BIG WORLD


TAG is a Global Real-Time Location Identification device – all that means is that it keeps an eye on what matters most to you. From your little ones after school, your elderly parents alone in retirement, to your suitcase whilst traveling. Look after them with TAG – from anywhere, at any time!




Watch how a busy working mom looks after her kids with TAG:

Or how a pet owner finds her lost dog:

YOU CARE DON’T YOU?

There are many things that matter to you – your family, your personal treasures, your business trip, your summer getaway… And let’s not forget - you.



In today’s big busy world, with so many things to care about, all you want more than ever is something that helps you – helps you care about everything that matters.
And here’s the answer – just TAG!












 




THE TAG SOLUTION






Ain’t No Distance Far Enough

TAG is fully-equipped with 3G HSPA Technology, Global GPS, and Overseas Roaming. That’s why, unlike traditional tracking devices and beacons that rely on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, TAG can be located with infinite range anywhere around the world.
When You're Down and Troubled

TAG’s advanced motion sensors immediately react to sudden movements. This means TAG quickly detects falls and is the first to notify you and any other user of what’s happened.


 
On Full Alert


The well-being of you and your loved ones is of the utmost importance. That’s why we’ve integrated a Panic Button into TAG. At a gentle push of the button, a notification or SMS will be sent to the app or to a pre-registered phone number.


On the Fence

Sometimes you just don’t have the time to keep checking your phone for updates. Did you know that TAG allows you to simply set Geo-Fences on the app? Geo-Fences are boundaries you can set so that when TAG enters or leaves those boundaries, you’ll be notified that very moment.


Designed for Function & Style



We know both functionality and design matter to you. So unlike other traditional GPS trackers, TAG has unique designs with a range of color options. Our chief designer also came up with stylish accessories that are not only functional, but also lets you to add a personal touch.


Share the Care


TAG not only shares its information just to you but also to anyone else you authorize through the TAG app. 




   

Lighten Up

TAG’s functional design extends subtly to a battery-indicating LED at the tip of the device. At a change in color you’ll know straight away when TAG requires charging.


Always in the Know

TAG syncs seamlessly with our free iOS and Android app. With it, you can locate the TAG device at your convenience. You could also set yourself reminders and receive notifications through the app for when a Geo-Fence or the Panic Button is triggered. Of course, this is only the beginning and there will be more app features coming to you soon!

Hassle-Free

Each TAG comes with a SIM card and one year’s subscription fee inclusive of global roaming. This means you don’t need to worry about buying a SIM card separately or paying troublesome monthly fees - it’s on us!

Accessories In Planning

We have just started to work on our accessories roadmap and have a couple in mind. Throughout our campaign we would love to get your feedback on the the ones you see here as well as ideas for some that you would like to see us develop! Just leave your thoughts in our comments section!


WHAT’S IN THE BOX?

Each box comes with a TAG device, a basic accessory, and a built-in SIM card. The SIM card includes a 1-year data plan with global roaming service. We are also throwing in a detachable accessory for another way for you to carry along your TAG.



TECH SPECS


600mAH rechargeable lithium battery
A-GPS (Assisted GPS) - enhances accuracy and faster time to first fix when in poor satellite conditions
GPS and GLONASS support - offers coverage from a larger number of satellites
Low noise amplifier integration - provides equivalent performance to an active antenna

SCHEDULE


HOW WE’LL USE THE MONEY RAISED
 


OUR VISION

We envision a future where TAG helps your everyday life, not only helping ease your mind when it comes to your family, but also protecting a variety of other valuables. With your help, we aspire to get TAG into the hands of everyone who cares.


OUR TEAM




 
OUR STORY



A working mother, a frequent traveler, an outdoor adventurer and an elderly caretaker – that’s the TAG Team at our office in the bustling city of Hong Kong. In today’s big and busy world, we are constantly being reminded that it doesn’t get any easier to keep an eye on the people and things that matter to each of us. The list of to-do’s seems endless, time seems short, yet what we care for and about more often than not keeps adding up. How can we take care of everything and everyone, and do it with style (because style matters)? Our solution became TAG. And why stop with us? We all share this problem and TAG can be our common solution. As a TAG owner, you become one of us – a person who cares!

Whether you’re traveling, biking, running, working or just going out for a night on the town, you can carry around your flat-packed skins and customize Shooz to fit any occasion. Just choose your styles of Skin and Sole, zip them together and get going!Shooz are made up of two different, interchangeable parts: a Shooz Skin and a Shooz Sole. Connect the ends of the skin and the sole special waterproof zipper, just like you would with a jacket. Once the zippers are linked, close the snap fastener on the heel and your Shooz are ready to go! You can customize and get creative just by choosing from the variety of skins and soles, giving you tons of footwear options for any occasion. You can finally stop settling on which shoes to take on a trip when there’s no more room in your suitcase. Make more space for clothes and souvenirs and still have a variety of different footwear with Shooz! Just lay the Shooz Skins flat in your luggage or backpack - EACH PAIR WILL TAKE UP THE SPACE OF A T-SHIRT.Just unzip the skin from the sole, throw it in the wash - you’ll get a deeper cleaning and faster drying than you ever would with a regular pair of shoes. Our leathers are processed with a special waxing treatment that allows for water resistance and washing.A nice pair of running shoes can cost over $100 a pair, and don’t even get us started on dress shoes. Stop spending a fortune and start saving with Shooz. Once you get your first pair of soles, you can create new combinations by getting new Shooz Skins at $75 and, as you increase your collection, you decrease your cost per shoe!Research shows that the manufacturing process used to make the sole of a normal shoe is what leaves the largest carbon footprint. Luckily, by sharing one sole with different skins Shooz provides a solution to drastically decrease the number of soles produced. Don't worry about guessing your shoe size, we’ll send out a survey at the end of the campaign to get your size right with our smart app ShoeSize.Me. Based on a shoe which you currently own and fits perfectly our app will find your ideal fit for Shooz. The results are created through a data-driven algorithm that is based on the previous experiences of other customers. Our size recommendation draws on a database of millions of data points and includes over 1,000 brands and 20,000 shoe models.Edoardo | Founder of ShoozEdoardo has worked as an industrial designer in studios between New York and Milan. He has successfully designed, launched and managed Veeshoo footwear brand (www.veeshoo.com), a patented flat-packable shoe that constitutes a first step to the conception of Shooz’s idea. From 2011 to 2015 he has developed his brand in the European and Asian markets and has since licensed it so he can dedicate all of his energies on Shooz. Has been assigned the Vogue Accessory Award, for innovation in footwear design in 2012.Flavia | DesignerFlavia, launched her own label in 2012 after apprenticing with some of the biggest names in the fashion world, including Valentino, Prada, and Vivienne Westwood. Interchangeable – Customizable – Feminine - Sustainable - are the key words of her innovative designs that match perfectly with Shooz’s philosophy. So who would better than her to design two special edition skins for the Kickstarter collection?Giorgio | ManagerGiorgio, finance professional at a global investment firm, is the manager mind behind the Shooz project. He takes care of finance, logistics and legal issues. Without him, we would probably be bankrupt!

<p>At Carpathia Watch Company we relish the hands-on experience of creating something personal and designing a watch that outlives trends, one that can be handed down. We are an independent watch brand committed to the art of horology, hoping to bring our taste in timepieces to other passionate collectors.</p>
<p>With high quality materials, an authentic Swiss movement and hand assembly in Switzerland, you’ll be investing in a watch worth passing on. This is a Swiss made, automatic timepiece, influenced by our Polish-American heritage. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>At the onset of design, we knew we wanted our watch to feel traditional but to reflect modern trends. Having collected watches my whole life, I knew what I normally look for; an excellent movement, a distinguishing factor, an interesting backstory. I loved traveling to Poland with my family, and bringing a rare watch back to Chicago, knowing no one else would have one quite like it. I wanted to convey that sense of rarity through my own watches as well. </p>
<p>I drew influences from those little known European watch brands I always collected, as well as high-end luxury watches. I worked together with my wife to pick finishes that reflected modern trends, and stood out. For our first model, we wanted to celebrate our hometown of Chicago, a diverse city that was built by immigrants, adorned with art deco details. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554418774/a7vy5gazu1in2yhxddgu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Ascent is Carpathia's flagship model. We wanted to celebrate both our European and American backgrounds. My wife and I are both Polish-American, and we grew up in Chicago which has had a vast immigrant population since the late 19th century. Every culture has left its mark on this city. Even the art deco style that Chicago is known for actually originates in Europe. So while our company name comes from the Carpathian Mountains that traverse our back yard in Poland, our first watch is dedicated to the city that raised us. </p>
<p>For over a century, people have come to Chicago hoping to do better, to achieve more, and elevate their lives. In fact the premise behind art deco is power and progress; it is about making culture and high society accessible. To symbolize what we and other Chicagoans aspire to in life, we named our watch The Ascent.</p>

<p>The most important element to us is a high quality movement. We opted to use an ETA 2824-2 elabore with top grade finishes. Top grade finish means our movement is fully decorated with an engraved rotor, blued screws, and Geneva stripes. Our movement is beautifully displayed in an exhibition case back. The sapphire glass on both sides is anti-reflective coated. Cases are made of a 316L stainless steel plated in their respective finishes. The watch has a standard 5 atm water resistance. </p>
<p>Meant to be a versatile dress watch, the case is 42mm in diameter. The art deco influence can be seen in the exaggerated, curved case lugs as well as the oversized onion crown. The oversized logo and styling of the numerals and markers are also reminiscent of the art deco era. Our name, logo, and the Chicago inscription can be found on the dial. The case back will be engraved with the production number; a feature limited to our Kickstarter backers. (Our production models will read Swiss Made on the dial as well as on the case back as opposed to Swiss mvmt) </p>

<p>We began with just an idea and a few sketches. I had a lifelong passion for horology and a talent in design but no idea where to begin in building Carpathia. </p>
<p>Sourcing manufacturers and obtaining prototypes was a long process. To ensure the highest quality materials were being used, we traveled to Switzerland to meet our manufacturers and movement suppliers. Countless samples of cases, dials and hands were produced until the exact vision and quality were achieved. </p>
<p>While prototypes were hand assembled by me in Chicago, final production will be assembled by a highly qualified team in Switzerland. The watches will then be personally inspected in Chicago before being sent to you. </p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Sourcing elements from many manufacturers from abroad is alway a challenge, as is meeting minimum order requirements. Since this is a high quality watch with a reputable movement, it is quite expensive to produce. Being a regular working class couple, we do not have the funds necessary to purchase a large quantity of materials in order to launch our brand. Funding through a campaign such as Indiegogo allows us to share our journey, involve you in the process of building Carpathia and to to provide funds that will allow us to make it all happen.</p>
<p>Finally, we are not immune to production setbacks and can not promise our manufacturers will adhere to our timeline. We can, however, assure you that we will be open and communicative about the development process so that you know where in production your watch is. Please always feel free to contact us directly. We deeply value your support!</p>

At Carpathia Watch Company we relish the hands-on experience of creating something personal and designing a watch that outlives trends, one that can be handed down. We are an independent watch brand committed to the art of horology, hoping to bring our taste in timepieces to other passionate collectors.
With high quality materials, an authentic Swiss movement and hand assembly in Switzerland, you’ll be investing in a watch worth passing on. This is a Swiss made, automatic timepiece, influenced by our Polish-American heritage. 
 

 

 

 
At the onset of design, we knew we wanted our watch to feel traditional but to reflect modern trends. Having collected watches my whole life, I knew what I normally look for; an excellent movement, a distinguishing factor, an interesting backstory. I loved traveling to Poland with my family, and bringing a rare watch back to Chicago, knowing no one else would have one quite like it. I wanted to convey that sense of rarity through my own watches as well. 
I drew influences from those little known European watch brands I always collected, as well as high-end luxury watches. I worked together with my wife to pick finishes that reflected modern trends, and stood out. For our first model, we wanted to celebrate our hometown of Chicago, a diverse city that was built by immigrants, adorned with art deco details. 
 

 
The Ascent is Carpathia's flagship model. We wanted to celebrate both our European and American backgrounds. My wife and I are both Polish-American, and we grew up in Chicago which has had a vast immigrant population since the late 19th century. Every culture has left its mark on this city. Even the art deco style that Chicago is known for actually originates in Europe. So while our company name comes from the Carpathian Mountains that traverse our back yard in Poland, our first watch is dedicated to the city that raised us. 
For over a century, people have come to Chicago hoping to do better, to achieve more, and elevate their lives. In fact the premise behind art deco is power and progress; it is about making culture and high society accessible. To symbolize what we and other Chicagoans aspire to in life, we named our watch The Ascent.

ETA - 2824-2 Elabore / Top grade finish
 

The most important element to us is a high quality movement. We opted to use an ETA 2824-2 elabore with top grade finishes. Top grade finish means our movement is fully decorated with an engraved rotor, blued screws, and Geneva stripes. Our movement is beautifully displayed in an exhibition case back. The sapphire glass on both sides is anti-reflective coated. Cases are made of a 316L stainless steel plated in their respective finishes. The watch has a standard 5 atm water resistance. 
Meant to be a versatile dress watch, the case is 42mm in diameter. The art deco influence can be seen in the exaggerated, curved case lugs as well as the oversized onion crown. The oversized logo and styling of the numerals and markers are also reminiscent of the art deco era. Our name, logo, and the Chicago inscription can be found on the dial. The case back will be engraved with the production number; a feature limited to our Kickstarter backers. (Our production models will read Swiss Made on the dial as well as on the case back as opposed to Swiss mvmt)

We began with just an idea and a few sketches. I had a lifelong passion for horology and a talent in design but no idea where to begin in building Carpathia. 
Sourcing manufacturers and obtaining prototypes was a long process. To ensure the highest quality materials were being used, we traveled to Switzerland to meet our manufacturers and movement suppliers. Countless samples of cases, dials and hands were produced until the exact vision and quality were achieved. 
While prototypes were hand assembled by me in Chicago, final production will be assembled by a highly qualified team in Switzerland. The watches will then be personally inspected in Chicago before being sent to you.

In order to make time for production and quality control, we estimate The Ascent to be ready by November 2019. We want to make sure you are getting the best possible watch. Should production move quicker or hit a roadblock, you will always be informed!
Carpathia watches offer a two year limited warranty which covers faulty workmanship under normal use of the product. In case of defects covered by the warranty, all components will be repaired or the watch will be replaced. Warranty pertains to watch function and components and does not extend to strap or buckle. 
 
 

 
Carpathia watches can be shipped to all participating countries outlined in the selection options through kickstarter. 
Please note that you are responsible for potential customs duties or other applicable taxes for your region, we will include an invoice with your item.
We hope to deliver all watches by November 2019. Be aware that this is an estimated delivery period which will depend on speed of manufacturing and potential setbacks. Actual delivery may be expedited or delayed, we will always be in touch regarding the process.

Risks and challenges
Sourcing elements from many manufacturers from abroad is alway a challenge, as is meeting minimum order requirements. Since this is a high quality watch with a reputable movement, it is quite expensive to produce. Being a regular working class couple, we do not have the funds necessary to purchase a large quantity of materials in order to launch our brand. Funding through a campaign such as Indiegogo allows us to share our journey, involve you in the process of building Carpathia and to to provide funds that will allow us to make it all happen.
Finally, we are not immune to production setbacks and can not promise our manufacturers will adhere to our timeline. We can, however, assure you that we will be open and communicative about the development process so that you know where in production your watch is. Please always feel free to contact us directly. We deeply value your support!",39.0,0,"1 Campaign

Wallet, we saw an opportunity to design something that we would like to use everyday. We used top quality materials, cutting edge design, added functionality and blended materials to elevate the bifold wallet as you know it. Each wallet is made and assembled in the USA, ensuring exceptional quality and attention to detail. The fine, genuine Italian vegetable tanned leather leather is cut, then sewn together with only the finest materials possible. The wallet has RFID blocking material laminated to it to keep your information safe. The silicone band's durable and elastic properties give you flexibility on how you use your wallet (banding both pockets together, banding one side or band-less). By blending these high quality materials, Dango P01 Pioneer Wallets offer a balanced feeling of old school manufacturing methods with modern design and functionality.</p><p><b>Dango P01 Pioneer Wallet Features:</b></p><ul>

<li>
<b>Craftsmanship:</b> It's produced by hand by craftsmen with natural and plant-based extracts, not mass-produced in factories like other leathers.</li>
<li>
<b>Uniqueness: </b>Vegetable-tanned leather is a unique process which produces a superior product. The end result is  a symbol of quality from the natural tanning process. Every wallet we produce has a unique look.</li>
<li>
<b>Durability: </b>Only the best quality hides are used to ensure maximum durability and strength. In fact, most light scratches and nicks can be wiped away.  Only 10% of the world's leather is made with the vegetable tanning process.  </li>
<li>
<b>Beauty with Age:</b> Wear and tear of Italian leather adds to its beauty and character. Unlike other leathers, it rarely needs to be cleaned. Wiping with a damp cloth every few weeks is the most that's ever expected.</li>
<li>
<b>Eco-friendly:  </b>Rather than coloring leather with chromium sulfate and acids, vegetable tanned leather is tanned using tree bark.  </li>
</ul><p>We use leather which is assembled and cut in San Francisco in a factory that is part of the SFMade Organization. SFMade’s mission is to support vibrant, domestic manufacturing for locally-made products, encouraging entrepreneurship and creating employment opportunities for a diverse local workforce.</p><div data-id=""18385109""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1509547711/gf0tyefv4v3iaifeefqe.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""18385121""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1509547711/uy7nnxlys74kymjylk4v.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Our pens are also made right here in the USA.

<p>Charlie has traveled extensively throughout the world for the past 5 years, learning about design, development and production. He has gained an understanding of what it takes to design, manufacture and ship good quality product, all while being on a tight schedule and meeting critical deadlines. He is passionate about product and functional design. He has always wanted to make ""cool"" products that people can relate to and see value in.</p>
<p>Thuan’s goal is to build and cultivate a progressive world where art and design matter in people's lives. Working for companies like Element Case, Focus Design and Speck Design, he has experience in both a hands on and advisory roles of design: everything from ideation and sketching through 3D CAD and product CMF (colors, materials and finishes). Over the years, Thuan has developed a keen eye for superior aesthetics and an in-depth understanding of how design can not only build a creative culture, but also inspire a creative lifestyle.</p>

Not only do we thrive on solving daily problems with simple solutions, but we also aspire to provide life experiences with a sense of style and uniqueness.Whether you are giving us a virtual fist bump, sharing our product through your social media or pledging, your support is critical to Dango Products' success. Thank you for joining us in our mission of bringing quality products to the market, fitting an active lifestyle with industrial design.                       With the Dango P01 Pioneer Wallet, we saw an opportunity to design something that we would like to use everyday. We used top quality materials, cutting edge design, added functionality and blended materials to elevate the bifold wallet as you know it. Each wallet is made and assembled in the USA, ensuring exceptional quality and attention to detail. The fine, genuine Italian vegetable tanned leather leather is cut, then sewn together with only the finest materials possible. The wallet has RFID blocking material laminated to it to keep your information safe. The silicone band's durable and elastic properties give you flexibility on how you use your wallet (banding both pockets together, banding one side or band-less). By blending these high quality materials, Dango P01 Pioneer Wallets offer a balanced feeling of old school manufacturing methods with modern design and functionality.Dango P01 Pioneer Wallet Features:
Handcrafted and assembled in the USA 
Vegetable tanned Italian leather 
Designed to hold up to 20 cards (business or credit cards) 
RFID blocking to keep your information safe and secure
Designed to work with our MT02 Multi-Tool (available separately).
24 Page Dango Notebook (included with the Dango P01 Pioneer Wallet + Pen)
Not only did we want to bring you an awesome wallet, we designed a custom pen to go along with it.  We CNC each pen in the USA from 6061 aerospace grade aluminum and anodize each pen to provide a durable finish. For the ink, we use the highly regarded Schmidt 4889M pressurized ink refill allowing you to write in the most difficult situations, always giving you the ability to write your thoughts, ideas and expressions at a moment's notice.  We thought of everything and really did our best to bring you a pen that works with you, fitting your needs and lifestyle.Dango Pen Features:
CNC'd 6061 aerospace grade aluminum 
Anodized finish for a long lasting, durable coating
Schmidt 4889M black ink refill (Made in Germany).  Compatible with Fisher space ink refills as well.  
Slotted end, allowing attach points for keyrings, lanyards, etc.  
Silicone o-rings for grip 
   Standard ballpoint pens rely on gravity to dispense ink, which is why they can only write at specific angles. This may be fine for writing on horizontal surfaces, but not for writing upside down or on vertical surfaces. Space ink cartridges use compressed air to dispense ink, allowing users to write on surfaces at any angle.        We feature RFID protection in all of our wallets to help insulate our customers from ""RFID skimming"" - a type of electronic pickpocketing. Many credit cards, drivers' licenses, and passports now come with embedded radio frequency identification chips. When activated by an RFID reader, these chips transmit certain types of information wirelessly, so that you can verify your identity or even make a purchase without swiping your card. Our wallets are built to protect you from these hackers.   Included with all our P01 Wallet + Pen combos, is a compact notebook that fits neatly in the P01 wallet.

     We chose to make the Dango P01 Pioneer Wallet in the US to keep American quality at the forefront, supporting our local communities, vendors and fellow business owners.     Italian Vegetable Tanned Leather is highly regarded as top quality due to several reasons:

Craftsmanship: It's produced by hand by craftsmen with natural and plant-based extracts, not mass-produced in factories like other leathers.

Uniqueness: Vegetable-tanned leather is a unique process which produces a superior product. The end result is  a symbol of quality from the natural tanning process. Every wallet we produce has a unique look.

Durability: Only the best quality hides are used to ensure maximum durability and strength. In fact, most light scratches and nicks can be wiped away.  Only 10% of the world's leather is made with the vegetable tanning process.  

Beauty with Age: Wear and tear of Italian leather adds to its beauty and character. Unlike other leathers, it rarely needs to be cleaned. Wiping with a damp cloth every few weeks is the most that's ever expected.

Eco-friendly:  Rather than coloring leather with chromium sulfate and acids, vegetable tanned leather is tanned using tree bark.  
We use leather which is assembled and cut in San Francisco in a factory that is part of the SFMade Organization. SFMade’s mission is to support vibrant, domestic manufacturing for locally-made products, encouraging entrepreneurship and creating employment opportunities for a diverse local workforce. Our pens are also made right here in the USA. We craft our pens from 6061 aerospace grade aluminum. CNC'd to perfection, we then anodize and finish our aluminum parts with local vendors who really care and take pride in good design. How does it work?

 The Impact



 Paying the Price Foundation has strong and faithful relationships with former college and professional athletes, who are trusted and respected in their communities.  These athletes have worked tirelessly with and without resources to make a difference in their communities.  Government cutbacks have caused the closing of many neighborhood community centers and eliminated resources that where once available to provide programs and mentoring to neighborhood youth.
Paying the Price Foundation recognizes its obligation and the opportunity to bring together the knowledge and resources of successful professionals from various communities to channel their talents and leadership skills back into these communities.
When former trusted athletes and professionals can return to the communities that raised them and demonstrate a sincere effort to bring both financial and technical resources to address community issues, the impact is unlimited.

    Other Ways You Can Help In addition to financial support you are encouraged to volunteer your time and participation to support the camp.  We are also in need to have some female basketball players to serve as role models for the female participants and of course a few male coaches who can actually run up and down the court.  We look forward to seeing you this Summer in Amityville and Philadelphia.

<h3>Filthy Commissions</h3>
<p>We are a couple of self-employed artists that stumbled into costuming in the year 2000 and haven't been able to put down the needle and thread ever since! We started making custom works of art for friends a few years after that, slowly broadening out to new people and new interests, and eventually Filthy Commissions was born. We're extremey honored that our favorite hobby has become popular enough to sustain our living, and we've met many great people and had wonderful opportunities as well.<br/><br/>We have won more than thirty awards scattered across the country - and even some internationally - for our custom works of art, and we've had the opportunity to be craftsmanship judges in competitions. We broadened to make clothing for ball jointed dolls and pets, wigs and outfits for drag queens, we host informative panels on how to's and tips, and we've even been in and hosted several fashion shows. Recently we aim to start up our own clothing line, and hope to be able to sell our own imagination to buyers who wish to wear a step above ordinairy. <br/><br/>All of this creativity happens right out of our tiny, 700sqft, one bedroom apartment. There are tubs of fabric lining our walls, foam heads scattered about, and our sewing machine is right in the middle of our living room floor - on the ground! We are in the process of finally moving into a bigger two bedroom and want to convert an area entirely for Filthy Commissions. We have started things off by purchasing our own domain for a new website, and look forward to being able to make things much more neater and professional! It will be nice to have an area specificaly devoted towards our hobbies and work, and we want to also be able to share our new style with our buyers as well.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/><br/>Any and all funds raised will go directly into Filthy Commissions. We are in desperate need of a sewing desk so that we don't continue to destroy our posture. We want to invest in a few different sized mannequins to better display our work and fit sizes, along with shelving for the wig stands, storage for all of our supplies, and tuning up/upgrading our machinery. <br/>We also would love to be able to get more professional supplies to go back to the buyer, such as packaging and display from us to you! We always give several free goodies with purchases, and would love to eventually give out nice hangers, garment bags, foam heads, wig caps, anything and everything the customer could ever imagine to keep their custom outfit looking nice and long lasting.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have a perfect run of feedback on multiple sites and people really enjoy our work, so this would be nudging us in a forward direction to hopefully grow even bigger and better, and allow us to put our creative little stamp on the world. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Please share our campaign with all of your friends. You never know who has a secret identity to protect their city, and needs a good crime fighting outfit.

<p><b>Help a young fashion designer and Parsons MFA candidate create her graduate collection to be shown during the New York Fashion Week.</b></p>
<p><b>About Me</b></p>
<p>My name is Andrea Jiapei Li and I am graduating this year from the MFA in Fashion Design and Society Program at Parsons. Prior to attending Parsons, I completed my undergraduate degree in Fashion Design in Beijing, China and spent months in Rotterdam as an exchange student. Since the beginning of this year, I have been spending days and nights at the studio working on the concept, design and production of my final womenswear collection, which will be presented at Milk Studios 
at New York Fashion Week on September 6, 2014. <b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Concept</b><br/>
I don’t want to just design
clothes, but also to tell the stories behind them and convey emotions. My
creative process typically evolves around a theme – it tends to be free-flowing
hence not constrained by considerations such as current trends. </p>
<p><b>Collection</b></p>
<p>The inspiration of my graduate collection came from a previous project, the goal of which was to define
and express ourselves in different ways. This gave me the opportunity to
further explore myself both as an individual and as a designer, and inspired me
to name my collection “I AM WHAT [I AM]”. </p>
<p>The original fabrics of the collection were purchased in
the garment district in New York, but I processed most of them through dying,
color spray or bonding to achieve the effects that would best represent the aesthetics and the vision of the collection. </p>

<p>This code is your ideal size of frame, even if you switch from one style to another, just like the your ideal size of shoes. <br/><br/><b>After the campaign, we will reach out to you arrive the Perfect Size of Frame.<br/>Simply select a Perk and sit back :)</b></p>

You probably don't know, because there is no such a choice, until now.
If clothes and shoes have sizes to choose from, why not glasses?MONO is a collection of eyewear sets out to bring the perfect-fit and thus enhance wearing comfort by providing the Choice of Size, a fundamental yet long-missing“feature”, made possible by the latest advancements in 3D printing technology.



We have invented an unique sizing system governing three measurements critical to wearing comfort- the width of front frame, the depth of nose pad and the length of temples. Each measurement is represented by S, M or L indicating Small, Medium and Large, forming a 3 digit code.
This code is your ideal size of frame, even if you switch from one style to another, just like the your ideal size of shoes. After the campaign, we will reach out to you arrive the Perfect Size of Frame.Simply select a Perk and sit back :)

glasses frame is composed of many parts, reducing its reliability.We manage to reduce them to just ONE- there is no

The temples are made collapsible by means of a patent-pending ""DNA joint"" and the material properties of 3D-printed nylon used. They bend in all direction adopting to the slightest difference in face features.







Prototypes in various mechanisms and materials were made to test out the bending performance, wearing comfort, and the look and feel.

We cut weight by using material of lower density. This enhances the wearing comfort without compromising the expression  of the rim frame.






The lens can be detached with just a snap thanks to the bend which opens up the frame. They also double as durable nose pads.
Turning MONO from a prescription glasses into sunglasses is effortless, reducing the need to travel with two pairs of glasses.



This makes MONO a photo filter in the real life.Filter the world beyond the lens with a cheerful tint of brown or a sober shade of blue depending on your mood of the day.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h2><strong>Kirsten Is Turning 40 on May 17th, 2013!!!!!!</strong></h2>
<p>This year for my 40th Birthday (in lieu of gifts, money, or well wishes) I'd like to ask all my friends and family to support the EARKY ""One for One and One"" project by purchasing one of the new EARKY Hats, so that one hat can be donated to a child in need within Alaska. In addition, for every hat purchased one child within rural Alaska will recieve a suicide prevention education (see video). </p>
<p>For every hat that is purchased, We will donate one hat and teach one child in need.</p>

<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Needs: For my 40th birthday, I'd like to be able to sponsor 100-200 hats (with your help) and deliver them to rural Alaskan Children who are in need of warm heads this July/August. In addiiton, for every hat sold, I'd like offer an Alaskan young person with a suicide prevention education, that might save a life. </p>
<p>The hats are a quality weave made of 100% yak wool and have a full fleece lining. (Yak wool is 15% warmer than Marino Wool and has many of the same positive qualities). The hats are very versatile (once size fits most). In addition, the hats are made in Nepal supporting woman business and rural community development.  </p>
<p>Hats to be delivered By June 30th (Free Shipping)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In my 13 years of teaching and living in Alaska, I've noticed a shortage of warm clothing for kids. Hat's keep 80% of your body heat from escaping, so it seems like a great place to start in helping meet a child's basic need of warmth, just a step closer to helping them excel in school and life. </p>
<p>Also, my teaching career, I've lost 18 of my former students to suicide and I'd like to do something positive to help give every kid a reason to say yes, to life. </p>
<p>The One to One model has been proven to be a sustainable way to make a positive impact when supporting a cause.</p>

Needs: For my 40th birthday, I'd like to be able to sponsor 100-200 hats (with your help) and deliver them to rural Alaskan Children who are in need of warm heads this July/August. In addiiton, for every hat sold, I'd like offer an Alaskan young person with a suicide prevention education, that might save a life. 
The hats are a quality weave made of 100% yak wool and have a full fleece lining. (Yak wool is 15% warmer than Marino Wool and has many of the same positive qualities). The hats are very versatile (once size fits most). In addition, the hats are made in Nepal supporting woman business and rural community development.  
Hats to be delivered By June 30th (Free Shipping)


The Impact
In my 13 years of teaching and living in Alaska, I've noticed a shortage of warm clothing for kids. Hat's keep 80% of your body heat from escaping, so it seems like a great place to start in helping meet a child's basic need of warmth, just a step closer to helping them excel in school and life. 
Also, my teaching career, I've lost 18 of my former students to suicide and I'd like to do something positive to help give every kid a reason to say yes, to life. 
The One to One model has been proven to be a sustainable way to make a positive impact when supporting a cause.



Other Ways You Can Help

Follow-UP
Everyone who donates will receive a link to the ERAKY  website (in development) where hat drop photos and video will be available.

THANKS EVERYONE!!          Please also stay tuned to our page for our upcoming new project We’re using the best materials and components to build an excessively quality and vintage-inspired design watches.   Links: Watchuseek, Watchinsider, Fratellowatches, WatchTime We are offering directly via Indiegogo and Kickstarter, we are able to cut out the retail channel, middlemen markups, brand exclusivity/scarcity, and offer a US 149 automatic watch with the most premium materials and vintage-inspired design.Seriously, try to find a better watch for a better price, and we’ll match it.  LENVINO Watch Co. was started in 2017 Jan, a group of watch-addicts with the passion and constancy of the traditional watch craftsmanship. We believe that the most timeless and desirable timepiece must be the traditional one. We would like to awaken people’s mind about the core function of a watch, thus create our brands. In 2017 Dec LENVINO Watch Co. launched its first Kickstarter campaign to fund the World’s First Minimalist Design Rectangular Tourbillon Watch. After 40 days on Kickstarter, it raised a total of HK$ 427,860. The result is the most backed tourbillon project on Kickstarter history.  With the success of the first model, LENVINO Watch Co. returns to Kickstarter and Indiegogo to introduce the new brand for you “LECRONOS”  “LECRONOS” is inspired by the word of ‘chronometer’, meaning high accuracy and precision. We strive to create authentic timepieces by combining traditional watch craftsmanship and vintage-inspired design concept.   We are a group of watch-addicts who have already worked in the Hong Kong watch industry for over 28 years. We specialized in the design and manufacturing of high quality quartz and automatic watches. We have established good relationships with the world’s leading watch manufacturers specializing in luxury watches for high-end brands that retail for over US$1,000, as well as renowned watch companies in the retail market with over 400 chain stores world-wide. Our ambition is to create our very own brand, which we can share with watch enthusiasts around the globe. Through “LECRONOS”, we are offering high-quality products with unique and exclusive designs comparable to watches at department stores and luxury brands, but at only a fraction of their retail price. We want to share our love for watches with you. But in order to do that, we need more than just having innovative and tradition designs, quality support from a world leading manufacturing partner, and 28 years of industry experience. Your support will be instrumental in helping us achieve our dream, and we are confident you will be impressed with the design, workmanship and value that our watches offer.  We believe that vintage is timeless. It represents the best of its kind and denotes its high quality from the past. We applied this philosophy in making our watch. We used the most premium materials, traditional craftsmanship and unique design to create this authentic timepiece.Since we have a huge passion on vintage cars, we curated the ‘Race for Vintage’ collection. Every detail in our racing watch is a nod to the features of classic sports cars. The vintage tachometer featured a dial design at its core, equipped with a reputable Japanese automatic watch movement. Besides, we used an innovative approach to differentiate both the hour-hand and minute-hand. We also offer interchangeable racing style Italian calf leather strap and Milanese strap for you to choose. Initially, LECRONOS “Race for the Vintage collection” will offer you 6 color combinations and 2 new versions to choose from. All watches are equipped with an Automatic japan movement and sapphire crystal.You will be able to choose the design versions by the survey email within 3 working days Brown & Khaki Version - Single curved sapphire crystal printed with vintage brown color dashboard featured a dial design coupled with the colored hands and second disc.

Most notably are Invicta and Seiko SAR collection, who features this calibre in a large range of their automatic watches.  It is a self-winding mechanical movement, with a hacking function and bi-directional winding system, an accuracy of -20 to +40 seconds a day, power reserve of 40 hours and mechanisms gleam with 24 jewels as it vibrates at 21,600 beats per hour. Seiko NH35A is providing accurate and reliable time-keeping functionality to the “Race for Vintage” collection. The dial finds inspiration in the tachometer of the 70s-80s vintage sports car. To differentiate the design from huge fashion watches that are going out in same, we stripped away all unnecessary elements from the dial, focusing exclusively on the crystal design. The dashboard featured dial design is printed on the inner side of the sapphire crystal.   For the purpose to let the user can read the time (Hour and minute) clearly, we had made a creative approach to the time display. For the human behaviour, people reading the time will look at the outer part of the watch and find the hour then the minute. We printed the outer side to be hours mark and the inner side is minutes and also indicated by two colored hands. The red one is indicated for the minutes and the white one is hours. To improve the motion of the dial, we designed a disc for indicating the seconds. The “Race for Vintage” collection spot a circular case with the curved bezel. The case is enclosed by a single curve sapphire crystal that is known for its excellent scratch-resistant on the front and a screw-down transparent caseback with vintage car wheel’s rim design prints pattern from the rear, allowing you to enjoy every movement of the laser brand marked movement rotor and balance wheel motion.Viewed from the side, the dome crystal joins the case back flawlessly through a smooth curved surface. The streamlined case is more than just an elegant design feature – it also allows for a slimmer profile.  The metal parts are made from 316L stainless steel, which translates to greater corrosion resistance and durability in high temperatures. We are offering two kinds of straps for the backer to choose 1. Racing style Italian leather strap and Milanese straps.  Our Racing style interchangeable watch straps are made from genuine Italian calf leather. The strap design is inspired by the racing gloves and punched with patterned holes for styling and cooling. The strap will also come with the polished 316L stainless steel buckles and engraved with our brand name “LECRONOS”. The straps have a width of 20mm x 18mm, a unisex functional length suitable for most customers, and 7 holes for adjustment. The wristband contains a quick release spring bar, so that the straps can be swapped in seconds without the need for special tools.  They are available in five different colors: (1) Dark Brown, (2) Navy Blue (3) Brown, (4) Black and (5) Grey Our Milanese straps are made from 316L stainless steel and come with an adjustable buckle which can be adjusted for every wrist size and engraved with our brand name “LECRONOS”. If you selected the Milanese straps, the plating color will be same as your watch case color. They are available in four different plating colors: (1) Silver, (2) Black, (3) Khaki gold tone, and (4) Rose gold tone.  Horween Leather Zulu strap (USD 45)  Horween Leather Company is one of the worlds recognized high quality leather factory in USA, Chicago since 1905.

Over time, each will age in its own particular way, giving you a unique piece of jewellery that can tell as much a story as you.   Choose from a range of twelve elements to wear from our selection of bracelets. From lightweight aluminium and titanium to heavyweight tungsten, lustrous gold to characterful copper, there's an element for everyone.Precision machined from solid metals guarantees you a lifetime of use without compromise. You’ll find wearing it comfortable and others will find it intriguing. Using solid machined materials, we've curated a range of twelve options, more than any other offering available. From precious metals such as gold and rhodium to lesser-known but vital elements such as vanadium and molybdenum, we've collected a series of elements that surround us in everyday life but often don't get the recognition they deserve.Personalise with a name, date or message to make your element truly unique. Each custom engraving is placed on the opposite side to the periodic symbol. You'll be able to specify your custom engraving in the post campaign survey.A simple, easy to use mechanism makes the bracelet easy to put on, take off and keeps itsecurely on you at all times.Available in two sizes,the bracelet draws into itself to create the perfect fit around your wrist.A classic minimal design let’s you stack up multiple elements without overloading your wrist. These pieces will stand the test of time, lasting for years to come, helping you look great every day, as we won’t compromise on quality. Each bracelet uses real braided nappa leather. You'll be able to choose your leather option in the post campaign survey.How do I choose?For one bracelet: Simply pick your element and back the pledge level that it belongs to. You will then get to specify your element and leather choice in the post campaign survey.For a whole Tier Pledge: You'll be able to choose three bracelets from the pledge level you back. For example, you could pick one of each element, or choose two coppers and a vanadium, the choice is yours.For custom pledges: If you'd like elements from across the tiers, a Titanium and a Gold element for example, all you have to do is back one of them and send us a private message to request the extra bracelet. We will then guide you through what to do next.  What will I receive?  Iron: 304 Stainless Steel. Stainless steel will not rust like solid iron, but still contains 95% Iron.Aluminium: 6061 Aluminium. An aerospace alloy comprised of 98% aluminium. Unlike pure aluminium, this alloy has massively increased characteristics, making it much stronger and more scratch resistant.Chromium:  316 stainless steel. Containing 18% Chromium, this steel has a brilliant shine.Copper: Solid copper. Pure, unadulterated copper. Vanadium: High vanadium steel (grade M4). Usually found inside jet engines or in the production of superconducting magnets.Molybdenum: High molybdenum steel (grade M1): Almost always alloyed with steel to greatly increase its strength and hardness.Tungsten: High tungsten steel (grade T15) - With the highest melting point of all metallic elements, tungsten is usually alloyed with steel to improve its stability under high temperatures.Titanium: Grade 2 Titanium - Unalloyed, pure titanium. Almost half the weight of steel but just as strong.Silver: Fine silver plated - 99.9% silver and plated to 2.5 microns, which is classed as heavy silver plate and will last a lifetime.Gold: 24cr gold plated - 99.9% pure gold and and plated to 2.5 microns. This is well above standard gold plating and will likewise last a lifetime.Palladium: Palladium plated - 99.9% pure, palladium is applied to 2 microns to give a scratch resistant, brilliant shine.Rhodium: Rhodium plated - 99.9% pure rhodium plating, hypoallergenic and plated to 2 microns.To find out which size you'll need, simply wrap a piece of string or length of paper around your wrist, mark the point where it meets itself and then measure the length of it using a ruler.

<p>Coco &amp; Sebastian is a new fashion label created by two very good fashion graduate friends who who wished to bring their unique and creative designs into the luxury acessories market, including scarves, kaftans, shawls and sarongs.</p>
<p>Since Sandy and Beena both work long hours in full-time jobs (Sandy in the ridiculously over the top world of fashion pr and Beena as an accessory designer for a big evil fashion corporation!) its difficult for us to raise funds to focus on our project. We desperately need your support.</p>
<p>We have, with a little help from our friends, put together a video to outline the story so far and we'd love you to join us on our journey...</p>
</div>

<p>We need exactly $8,000 US dollars to start our commercial production. We already have: <br/><br/>*our ranges designed and samples produced<br/>*strong interest from high profile buyers<br/>*exhibition space secured at Fashion Weeks.<br/><br/>BUT we need funding to get our production live. PLEASE SUPPORT US NOW and you'll get access to a whole array of REWARDS (from luxury scarves to trips to London Fashion Week).</p>
<p>Plus our promise to keep you updated with our journey via video updates on our facebook page: facebook.com/cocoandsebastian </p>
<p>ALL funds will be allocated to production.</p>

<p>Our Blue watch is <strong>equipped with a vulcanized blue/red rubber strap</strong>. It is waterproof and long-lasting and has excellent resistance to UV rays, excessive heat, and cold, stretching, tearing, dirt and dust, abrasion, chemicals, and staining. The rubber is incredibly soft but miraculously durable. Our rubber straps are designed to breathe! We created a profile on the inside of the strap to make it less sweaty during a hot summer day or less wet after a good dive!</p>

<p>For the best visibility under every circumstance, we added the <strong>Super-LumiNova® Grade X1</strong> to the indexes, hands, and bezel insert of all our models. The Swiss Super-LumiNova® Grade X1 shows a performance increase of up to 60% after two hours compared to the standard LumiNova® grade(s). </p>
<p>Swiss Super-LumiNova® is non-radioactive, REACH compatible, high temperature resistant, and resistant to environmental influences. It works like a light storage battery, where light charges the battery, and afterward, the light is continuously emitted. This activation and subsequent light emission process can be repeated again and again, and the material does not suffer any aging. It is chargeable with sunlight or artificial light. </p>

</div></div>","Independent of the crowdfunding results these watches will be manufactured!  The Ligure Watches story is all about friendship and the passion for watchmaking  It all started after we met again in the harbor of Portofino in Ligure this spring and decided to make our dream come true. We share a common passion for the sea, scuba diving, and la dolce vita. Together we opened the window of new opportunities and went on an exciting new path. An adventure of trust, reliability, joy, and the beauty of the deep sea. We stimulated each other to make our shared dream come true by creating our ultimate scuba dive watch.Jannieke, Loek, Rob and PieterThe watches are created out of passion for the Italian Ligure, Scuba Diving, a love for luxury watches, and our wish to develop high-quality watches with a Swiss movement for an outstanding price-value proposition. We are proud to present to you the first collection of Ligure Watches, the Tartaruga series.  Turtles are one of the most diverse animal species in the world. There are roughly 7 different types of turtles, two of them are aquatic water turtles. There are a lot of them in de Mediterranean Sea and on the coastline of the Italian Ligure. They inspired us during the process of designing the case for the first series of the Ligure watches. That is why we used the Italian name for turtle: The Tartaruga SeriesThe case is made of 316L stainless steel with a brushed effect on the top surfaces and a polished effect on the side and bottom surfaces. The case is a cushion style case which is the defining element of the retro theme and mimics the general shape of a tartaruga shell. Due to this shape and the crown placed on the 4, our watches have a very pleasant wearing comfort!The case diameter measures a burly 43 mm and has a thickness of 1.1 cm.We designed from an aesthetic point of view; the top edge of the case is extended over the 22 mm lugs. The strap is attached under this ‘roof’ so the space between strap and case is concealed and fits nicely.  The 316L stainless steel bezel is slightly descending and has an improved coin edge for an excellent grip. The insert is covered with Sapphire glass for a beautiful appearance, durability, and won't scratch!Our watches meet the ISO 6425 criteria which are: a minimum depth-rating of 200 meters, a unidirectional bezel with markings at least every five minutes, a dial visible in total darkness, and an indication in the darkness that the watch is running. The watches are also anti-magnetic and shock-resistant, as well as resistant to corrosion in seawater. Our timepieces are rugged, reliable, and legible.    Top-rated dive watches offer functionality, style, and quality, a combination that you find particularly among the more luxurious brands. With the Ligure Tartaruga Series we offer a trilogy of timepieces of the highest quality possible, but yet affordable for all watch lovers and adventure seekers whether in the water, in the sky, or on land.  

 
Our BLUE Automatic GMT has a Swiss Sellita SW330 movement. 
 

 
A Sellita SW330 movement is a clone of the ETA 2893-2. As Sellita matured over the years, it perfected production and both the quality and reliability of its movements are generally considered to be comparable to ETA.
 

Our Blue watch is equipped with a vulcanized blue/red rubber strap. It is waterproof and long-lasting and has excellent resistance to UV rays, excessive heat, and cold, stretching, tearing, dirt and dust, abrasion, chemicals, and staining. The rubber is incredibly soft but miraculously durable. Our rubber straps are designed to breathe! We created a profile on the inside of the strap to make it less sweaty during a hot summer day or less wet after a good dive!

Our WHITE Automatic GMT has a Swiss Sellita SW330 movement

The Sellita SW330-1 is an automatic watch movement with a second-time zone display via a centrally located GMT hand.
We dressed up our white watch with the well known Oyster bracelet. The Oyster bracelet is recognized by its flat three-piece link construction. Made out of 316L and with a screwed link, the Oyster bracelet is considered to be one of the most sportier steel bracelets and we thought very suitably for our 'desk diver'.

Our BLACK Automatic has a Swiss Sellita SW200 movement

 

A Sellita SW200 movement is a clone of the ETA 2824-2 – the main difference is that the Sellita caliber has an extra jewel (26 rubies vs. 25 for ETA). As Sellita matured over the years, it perfected production and both the quality and reliability of its movements are generally considered to be comparable to ETA.
As well as the Blue watch, the black watch is equipped with our signature vulcanized rubber two-colored Black/ Red strap. 
€ 495 Super Early Bird (only 50 available )€ 550 (€ 795 Retail price after the campaign)
 

 
For the best visibility under every circumstance, we added the Super-LumiNova® Grade X1 to the indexes, hands, and bezel insert of all our models. The Swiss Super-LumiNova® Grade X1 shows a performance increase of up to 60% after two hours compared to the standard LumiNova® grade(s).

This activation and subsequent light emission process can be repeated again and again, and the material does not suffer any aging. It is chargeable with sunlight or artificial light. 
 

 

 

 
 

 
 
The screw-down case-back is made of solid stainless steel to aid the water-resistance performance and displays the shape of Italy, with embossed the region of Ligure. The coordinates of the Ligurian sea are engraved. 
 

 

 
The rubber strap and the Oyster bracelet are accompanied by a Ratchet Buckle Clasp which is an ideal wetsuit watch band buckle. The ratchet theory extension mechanism is of great importance for both convenience and safety

I have sold through Hat Happenings and top stores like Henri Bendel's, Nordstroms, and also</strong></p>
<p><strong>through custom orders. I need to pay for a high end craft show in Westchester <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>in May, need to do a new spring line, and pay for craft shows in Martha's Vineyard this summer. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>From an article called The Importance of Hats, about hats and my hats,<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>""Mindy's creations are magnificent, in terms of quality and chic, in a word...incomparible. Each one is tenderly made with devotion and care and she believes that donning this last piece of an outfit crowns the person with a true sense of charm, individuality, and refinement.""<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>""With her indelible manner, she does a personalized showing for gatherings of people in which she entertains and delights customers with her unique brand of wit and charm and shows them the true significance of wearing hats again.""<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>""Her hats aren't just pleasing fashions, but origination's of love, art, and inspiration, each one a spiritual gift from an artist that expresses infinity's creative possibilities and a diadem of glory for each wearer."" Jan Kitchin<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>There is a very good write up about my work at <a href=""http://www.ladyviolette.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ladyviolette.com</a> as well.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>What I need and what you get   <br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong>I need to purchase straw bodies, fabric, and need to have hats blocked at a factory in New York City. I live a little over an hour from there, and the transportation to get there and back is about $45 with subways and trains.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I need to do about 20 hats for the collection. Blocking costs $12 per hat for straws, but some hats cost more since they are sewn and can cost $35 and up with a different type of straw called Paglalina, starbright and more.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Panama straws cost $15-23 and up for an 8"" large brim.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Parasisol straws are $18-27<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Trims: Flowers, ribbons, veiling and vintage trim can be costly as well. They vary depending if they are vintage or new, and how much trim per hat.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Hat boxes, and tissue for wrapping. I need fabric paint since I do hand painting on hats and clothing. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>The craft show that I committed to costs $755 for the booth fee, plus transportation to get there and back. It's about an hour away from myhouse. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I  need to get a refurbished smartphone so I can charge my orders, and only use it for my shows, paying for data with a prepaid service per month only. <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I will  need lodging since it will be too far to drive an hour each way after working the show, and transportation/living costs to get to Martha's Vineyard. <br/></strong></p>

<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","I, Mindy Fradkin-Mousaa, (aka) Princess WOW! am a multi talented artist who makes hats, sings, (often with my husband, Roland Mousaa),enlightens and entertains  with my hats at an event I created years ago called a Hat Happening. I have sold through Hat Happenings and top stores like Henri Bendel's, Nordstroms, and also
through custom orders. I need to pay for a high end craft show in Westchester 
in May, need to do a new spring line, and pay for craft shows in Martha's Vineyard this summer. 
From an article called The Importance of Hats, about hats and my hats,
""Mindy's creations are magnificent, in terms of quality and chic, in a word...incomparible. Each one is tenderly made with devotion and care and she believes that donning this last piece of an outfit crowns the person with a true sense of charm, individuality, and refinement.""
""With her indelible manner, she does a personalized showing for gatherings of people in which she entertains and delights customers with her unique brand of wit and charm and shows them the true significance of wearing hats again.""
""Her hats aren't just pleasing fashions, but origination's of love, art, and inspiration, each one a spiritual gift from an artist that expresses infinity's creative possibilities and a diadem of glory for each wearer."" Jan Kitchin
There is a very good write up about my work at www.ladyviolette.com as well.
What I need and what you get   
I need to purchase straw bodies, fabric, and need to have hats blocked at a factory in New York City. I live a little over an hour from there, and the transportation to get there and back is about $45 with subways and trains.
I need to do about 20 hats for the collection. Blocking costs $12 per hat for straws, but some hats cost more since they are sewn and can cost $35 and up with a different type of straw called Paglalina, starbright and more.
Panama straws cost $15-23 and up for an 8"" large brim.
Parasisol straws are $18-27
Trims: Flowers, ribbons, veiling and vintage trim can be costly as well. They vary depending if they are vintage or new, and how much trim per hat.
Hat boxes, and tissue for wrapping. I need fabric paint since I do hand painting on hats and clothing. 
The craft show that I committed to costs $755 for the booth fee, plus transportation to get there and back. It's about an hour away from myhouse. 
I  need to get a refurbished smartphone so I can charge my orders, and only use it for my shows, paying for data with a prepaid service per month only. 
I will  need lodging since it will be too far to drive an hour each way after working the show, and transportation/living costs to get to Martha's Vineyard. 
You will get recognition that you helped me.
I can make you my famous cookies, jewelry for kids and adults, my hats for men/women, a Hat Happening!,  and my hand painting on your choice of garments!
If you can add shipping costs to your contribution, that would be wonderful since there are several fees associated with doing this campaign from paying for indiegogo, credit card, paypal, New York sales tax( if you live in New York State, I must pay sales tax) plus material and blocking costs in making items for you if that is your reward. Thanks for understanding.

<p>Thanks for checking out Camino Wear! As you've seen from our video, we're Evi and Heli and we're looking for YOUR help to launch our first line of Camino Wear; clothing and accessories that celebrate and are inspired by walking, travel and adventure!</p>
<h2>Why Camino Wear:</h2>
<p>We believe that walking, travel and adventure are some of the most important things in life.</p>
<p><strong>Walking</strong>, because (in our humble opinion) slow travel is best. To be outdoors, to be active, to be in one's environment = a happier, healthier life full of beautiful, small moments.</p>
<p><strong>Travel</strong>, because this world is incredible and so very diverse. Meeting new people and experiencing new things allows us to grow; both in our compassion for others and also for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Adventure</strong>, because life is too short to become complacent.</p>
<p><em>Because purposeful wandering is the opposite of being lost.</em></p>
<p>Camino Wear is just one small way of celebrating these values, and our little part in furthering conversations about them!</p>
<h2>Our first line:</h2>
<p>Our first line is heavily inspired by, and focused on the Camino de Santiago (as you've seen in the video), but we believe that a number of the designs are universally appealing and hope that you do too!</p>
<p><img alt=""The T Shirts!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/870806/pictures/original/20130614070415-4_shirts.jpg?1371218660"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""The undies!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/870815/pictures/original/20130614071243-2_Undies.jpg?1371219166"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>The details:</h2>
<p>For the initial line we are going with American Apparel products - great quality, and ethics that we can stand behind.</p>
<p>The designs will be printed using water-based ink which is not only better for the environment than plastisol but is also much softer to the touch and nicer to wear.</p>
<h2>Why we need you:</h2>
<p>Getting clothes printed is no cheap endeavour - especially picking textiles and ink that are of high quality, knowing that the people who are making them recieve a fair wage, and knowing that the environment is being taken into consideration.</p>
<p>We have everything lined up, we're just lacking the cash to get us there.</p>
<p>We really believe in our little line, and want to get it out in the world - we just need your help to get it there!</p>
<p>And although we put 2500 as our goal, we're hoping to raise even more! With more money we can order more pieces, set up our online shop and create even more designs!</p>
<p>By contribuing to our campaign you will:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;"">Become part of the Camino Wear story - you will be a part of making this awesome clothing line come to life, and making a small dream come true (and what's better than that, right?!)</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;"">Recieve some AWESOME perks - things that you will treasure for years to come! (See further below)</li>
<li class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;"">Our eternal love and gratitude. For serious.</li>
</ul><p>We have chosen the flexible funding model because (insert sad face) if we don't reach our goal, we would still like to use any money that we recieve and although we won't be able to produce as much as planned, we can still get Camino Wear out into the world (even if only into a few hands!)</p>
<h2>What if I can't afford to contribute:</h2>
<p>You can still get involved, and be of immense help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell everyone you know, especially those who you think would really dig Camino Wear</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools and post our link on facebook, on twitter...anywhere you can think of!</li>
</ul><h2>The perks! </h2>
<p>Each of our T shirts, for the first line will be printed on American Apparel Unisex Fine Jersey T's, with a choice of V-neck or Crew neck. They're super soft, super comfy and a superb fit for all shapes and sizes. However, ladies, you may want to order a size down from what you normally do, as AA unisex shirts are a little bigger than the average women's sizing.</p>
<p>The first two t shirt designs we are going to print are:</p>
<p><strong>'Don't Stop Walking'</strong> - inspired by the numerous stop signs that have been 'enhanced' along the Camino. A constant reminder to never stop walking, wandering, or moving forward.</p>
<p><img alt=""Don't Stop Walking T's"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/875848/pictures/original/20130617071244-DSW_both.jpg?1371478363"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>'Vino Camino'</strong> - celebrating the comradery and connections that develop while walking and traveling. Choice of side or centre placement.</p>

<p>We will also be printing our cheeky, charming and comfy, affectionatly dubbed '<strong>Pilgrims Panties</strong>' that feature the quintesential arrow and shell from the Camino - and what better place to wear them than on your undergarments - we're particularily fond of these designs and hope you dig them too!</p>
<h2><img alt=""The undies!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/871230/pictures/original/20130614104526-2_Undies.jpg?1371231925"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<p>If we surpass our goal, we will also be printing our next two t shirt designs</p>
<p><strong>'My Map'</strong> - What's better than a map of the Camino wrapped around your body? Not much, we say! A reminder of all the places you walked through, and a great conversation starter about long-distance walking. We're excited about printing other maps in the future to celebrate other long distance walks!</p>

<p>Because we have chosen the 'flexible funding' model we want to make sure that we keep our committment to all our wonderful contributers. So, to start we will FOR SURE print those two t shirts and the undies. As more contirbutions are made, we will make more designs available.</p>

<p>Nope! You can contribute even more! Excited about the 125 perk but want to contribute 250? No problem. That's why all our perk levels say ""this amount or more""!  <span class=""fl goal-amount""><br/></span></p>

From this initial idea was born <strong>CUSTODIUM</strong> tracker, after a year of work, we can present the result.<br/><br/><strong>CUSTODIUM</strong> tracker is the first miniature, open hardware, modular, gps tracker that provides all documentation, examples and support, the end user can thus adapt to their specific needs, making them communicate with other devices, placing sensors etc. Our idea is that the user must have total freedom to select the gprs data provider, web application, maps etc.  Feel free to create your firmware, web application or accessories.<br/><br/>Due to its modular design we are working on some modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>USB host</li>
<li>Power from 7 ~ 14 VDC</li>
<li>Solar Panel</li>
<li>SD storage</li>
<li>Wireless (Wifi, bluetooth, xbee ...)</li>
<li>Expansion board with more I/O ports</li>
</ul><p><br/>The programmed version, with <strong>CUSTODIUM</strong> firmware, unlike other gps trackers does not use SMS technology, it sends the data to a server, with a web application like Google Maps™; with which the end user can see the position of several trackers, see routes that have been made and export data to other applications.</p>

From this initial idea was born CUSTODIUM tracker, after a year of work, we can present the result.CUSTODIUM tracker is the first miniature, open hardware, modular, gps tracker that provides all documentation, examples and support, the end user can thus adapt to their specific needs, making them communicate with other devices, placing sensors etc. Our idea is that the user must have total freedom to select the gprs data provider, web application, maps etc.  Feel free to create your firmware, web application or accessories.Due to its modular design we are working on some modules:

USB host
Power from 7 ~ 14 VDC
Solar Panel
SD storage
Wireless (Wifi, bluetooth, xbee ...)
Expansion board with more I/O ports
The programmed version, with CUSTODIUM firmware, unlike other gps trackers does not use SMS technology, it sends the data to a server, with a web application like Google Maps™; with which the end user can see the position of several trackers, see routes that have been made and export data to other applications.

<p>Let me start by saying thank you for taking time to come and read this. An african designer is something that almost holds no bearing and taking a leap into this profession has not been easy. My main aim going into product design was to create innovation through craft and culture. Often i think to myself about morphing the Nigerian Aesthetic and all that comes to mind is the Practical Tribal Representations as opposed to the uncomfortable western ideals that have turned into cliches. Fusionkelvar has one primary goal in mind, and that is to unite Africans through creativity, craft and job creation. <br/><br/>Sometime last year, My associates and I spoke about creating proper hand crafted goods with Engineered African Wax Prints that wouldn’t be a cliche piece of clothing. We settled on a five panel for the first product<span class=""text_exposed_show"">, as some know is tough to make, which is why it took nearly a year to realize.<br/><br/>After working closely with one very skilled Nigerian menswear tailor here in Lagos, it was realized gloriously in 2 weeks. We plan to keep pushing Quality Dry Goods that stem from Innovation, Function and Culture. This is the first set of prototypes, which clearly need more careful attention to detail provided there are better tools to work with and more hands on deck.</span></p>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show"">The name, <strong>Kalakuta</strong>, was chosen from the communal compound created by Fela Kuti which housed his family, band members and recording studio. It was destroyed at a point by the Nigeria Army because his music tried to bring common sense into west africa and the Nigerian Goverment would have none of that. He fought through a lot of hardships with only his music as a weapon and companion. Above all he gave many a reason to see hope. </span></p>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show"">These hats dont only symbolize an art form but give power to many who see success and economical growth lost to a corrupt system. </span>Nigeria has been listed as the worst place to be born in this generation, sadly there are happy people here who find joy in seeing other shine brightly in wax print garments. Buying a <strong>kalakuta</strong> hat wont only spread the love but lift the mental burden of perpetual hopelessness. </p>
<p>Every <strong>kalakuta</strong> hat is not perfect but is differnt in its own way. All profits are used to buy better equipment, create a packing sytem, improve the state of our studio so we can keep supplying jobs and encourgaing globalization of the Made in Africa slogan. Note that all manufacturing is done primarly by hand and materials are sourced directly from Nigeria.</p>
<p>Each <strong>kalakuta</strong> hat costs 30 dollars to make but with shipping, supply of Electricity and man power the total price will be 50 dollars for the buyers. To get the online store and small scale factory running we will need 10, 000 dollars in total. 8, 000 dollars will be used for machinery and materials while 2, 000 will go to packaging and shipping logistics.

<h3>Hi everyone,</h3>
<p>let us introduce ourselves. <a href=""http://wtfjeans.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WTFJeans </a>is a small business located in Serbia - Europe with a team of three - Pedja Puselja, Anamaria Ursa and Dejan Puselja. The WTFJeans story has started purely out of our personal needs. At first, we wanted to make some jeans with special pockets for our smartphones, and later also shirts. So we did! All of our friends (and our friends’ friends) loved the idea and wanted to wear our designs. At that point, our biggest adventure started.</p>
<p>We were not fashion designers, but only geeks wanting something cool and practical, so we found an awesome team of designers who helped us make our ideas come true. Now that we have already designed jeans it is time to make a cool shirt. The first prototype is ready, the only thing we need is your help to start this project.</p>
<p><strong>WTFShirt</strong> will have two pockets in the front, specially designed for smartphones. They will be iPhone 5 compatible, but any smartphone up to 4.87"" x 2.31"" x 0.30"" will fit perfectly. On the inside of the pockets there will be a little gap adjusted for a headphone cable and the holder inside the collar will serve to hold it.</p>
<p>The cool thing about this shirt lies in the bottom right corner of the shirt. It is a small cloth, hidden on the inner side, which is perfect for cleaning smartphone screens and glass.</p>
<p><strong>WTFShirt</strong> is going to be made in Kragujevac, Serbia - Europe. For the production of it we have chosen the family manufactory named Breeches, since we have already worked with them and their designers have met all of our requirements. There is no doubt this product will be expertly manufactured.</p>
<p>There is always the question of ""Why?"" Why are we doing all this?. The answer couldn’t be simpler. All of us have smartphones these days and some of us are really attached to them. Girls got it easy, they all carry bags around with them. But us guys, we always struggle with our tech pets and we need a pocket to carry our phones without stressing about losing it or damaging it. And we like to look good, too.</p>

<h3><strong>Sizes</strong></h3>
<p>We worked really hard and we did our best to make your online shopping as easiest as possible, so we made a Size Guide with exact dimensions of every WTFShirt we made. If you still manage to order a wrong number, don't worry, the super WTFTeam is here to save the day and exchange your shirt for the right size :)</p>
<h4>Update 02/25/2013</h4>
<p><em>At the end of our campaign, before we ship your order, we are going to contact you to get your size. Until then, check our Size Guide to make sure you get the right size. :)</em></p>

That's right, we are providing worldwide free shipping. ;)</em></p></div>","Hi everyone,
let us introduce ourselves. WTFJeans is a small business located in Serbia - Europe with a team of three - Pedja Puselja, Anamaria Ursa and Dejan Puselja. The WTFJeans story has started purely out of our personal needs. At first, we wanted to make some jeans with special pockets for our smartphones, and later also shirts. So we did! All of our friends (and our friends’ friends) loved the idea and wanted to wear our designs. At that point, our biggest adventure started.
We were not fashion designers, but only geeks wanting something cool and practical, so we found an awesome team of designers who helped us make our ideas come true. Now that we have already designed jeans it is time to make a cool shirt. The first prototype is ready, the only thing we need is your help to start this project.
WTFShirt will have two pockets in the front, specially designed for smartphones. They will be iPhone 5 compatible, but any smartphone up to 4.87"" x 2.31"" x 0.30"" will fit perfectly. On the inside of the pockets there will be a little gap adjusted for a headphone cable and the holder inside the collar will serve to hold it.
The cool thing about this shirt lies in the bottom right corner of the shirt. It is a small cloth, hidden on the inner side, which is perfect for cleaning smartphone screens and glass.
WTFShirt is going to be made in Kragujevac, Serbia - Europe. For the production of it we have chosen the family manufactory named Breeches, since we have already worked with them and their designers have met all of our requirements. There is no doubt this product will be expertly manufactured.
There is always the question of ""Why?"" Why are we doing all this?. The answer couldn’t be simpler. All of us have smartphones these days and some of us are really attached to them. Girls got it easy, they all carry bags around with them. But us guys, we always struggle with our tech pets and we need a pocket to carry our phones without stressing about losing it or damaging it. And we like to look good, too.

Sizes
We worked really hard and we did our best to make your online shopping as easiest as possible, so we made a Size Guide with exact dimensions of every WTFShirt we made. If you still manage to order a wrong number, don't worry, the super WTFTeam is here to save the day and exchange your shirt for the right size :)
Update 02/25/2013
At the end of our campaign, before we ship your order, we are going to contact you to get your size. Until then, check our Size Guide to make sure you get the right size. :)

Welcome to Our Crowdfunding Page!What is so special about the RocketBuddha Tee Shirt?Each image in this line of designs was started with graphite sketches in a journal  then advanced through multiple stages until camera ready for the printing process.  Truly becoming an old world craftsmen tradition this hands on approach gives a very distinctive result you will be proud to wear.  Offering six designs printed on your choice of American Apparel shirt style, with ink/shirt color choices, we bring you over  5,000 choices!!  Companies outside this gift economy can not match what we are able to bring you with this Crowdfunding Campaign!Our price is below competitive designs, and during this campaign, we are able to offer  no shipping charges or taxes added to your total at checkout  - promise!We will use ALL your funds in local economies, printing, sourcing all materials, silk screening.  Most importantly our vendors offer healthcare and living wages to their employees.

Selecting Other GiftsWhere is your money going?
We’ve invested over $2,000 of our personal funds and untold hours up to this point for product development and printing three batches of shirts.  These shirts help us refine our drawings for the next printing and are used in market surveys.  Our next steps are to move to final art production, refining lines and contours to maximize the printing process, and purchase bulk quantity of shirts and a roll of thick, soft fine art paper then move to the manufacturing phase.
If we hit our fundraising goal we can smoothly get these Tee Shirts into production and into your hands, and continue to evolve this series of drawings for future designs as we officially launch RocketBuddha the company!  
Shipping/Delivery Schedule
We realize that December is a busy month and estimates are often optimistic yet our #1 goal is to ship all the tee shirts too you before Christmas!  
Risks and Challenges
The team has spent a lot of time building relationships with our vendors to ensure as few risks as possible. Even so, the unexpected can happen. We believe in transparency and clear communication, if anything changes you’ll be informed immediately.Other Ways you can HelpSo you love what we are doing, but aren't in a position to give monetarily - we get that. We're struggling substitute school teachers, after all. There are a few ways you can help: Share this campaign with your friends, family and co-workers to help get the word out using:  *   The plethora of sharing tools here at Indiogogo to help spread the word about this campaign*   The website RocketBuddha.com, head to that site and use the share tools and, if you haven't picked up a perk, you can fill in the form to get on our mailing list for campaign updates:RocketBuddha Web Site
Facebook:RocketBuddha Facebook Page
or TwitterRocketBuddha Twitter FeedFAQ                                       How do I order my size?
We have found the sizing charts (found in the gallery) to be quite accurate except for the 3/4 sleeve Girly Raglan.  If you order to the sizing chart, and one size up for the 3/4 sleeve, your tee shirt should fit perfect. 
How much is shipping?
If in the US shipping is included. If outside of the US please add $30 to your order during the checkout process. This is a flat fee for international shipping.
Do you do international shipping?

<p>Announcement.
Applause. And then pin drop silence. </p>
<p>I was going
to be the next one on the romp right in front of those peering critical eyes and
judgmental looks which were going to<span> 
shred me to pieces. I took a long breath to hold some air in my lungs
which felt so punctured. </span></p>
<p>My heart was
pounding in my chest. And I must be sweating. </p>
<p>I just have
to stand tall and strut my stuff. Well, much taller from my 5’11 frame. In
fact, it was not even physical but I had to break away from the fear sitting so
deep inside my head.</p>
<p>’Josefine,
you are not good enough. You can’t do it. You can’t do anything. You ain’t
pretty. You would screw it up’. So many sounds howling in my head. So many
different voices. And I had to shut them up all of them. </p>
<p>’The only
thing I have to fear is fear itself’. I murmured to myself and the girl next to
me lookes back at me. Perhaps she had overheard me. </p>
<p>1,2,3,....I
took a deep breath and took my first step on the romp. Just like Neil
Armstrong’s first step on the moon.<span>  A
small step but a giant leap. I looked poker faced, determined and was almost
swimming in the air. Every step, I took, I was stepping onto all those
rejections, fears, funny names and taunts and I felt growing taller with each
stride. These were just the waves of huge applause which brought me back to
reality. </span></p>
<p>I had done
it. The 21 years old scared girl who was signed up by a friend for a
competition called Top Model Worldwide, stood among the finalists out of 10,000 contestants. That day, I won two out of five awards- a 3rd place in Top Model
Worldwide and the Winner of Skin Beauty Award! The little girl under the
kitchen table cried out of joy deep down in my heart, I actually accomplished
something breaking away from those chains which kept me tied up for the last so
many years! I was ALIVE!</p>
<p>My name is
Josefine. I am a <i>dreamer</i>, a <i>believer</i> and most of all- an <i>achiever</i>. </p>
<p>During my
childhood, every day when I came home from school, I used to sit under the
kitchen table and look into the fashion magazines. I pushed my glasses up on my
freckled nose and hugged the magazine, dreaming that one day I could be one of
those pretty girls.    </p>
<p>The years
went by and my dream never faded. The dream of succeeding and looking confident
and and beautiful. The dream of being able to transform and rise above my fears.
The dream of being a role model for other girls &amp; boys in this world who
have been told by others that they wern’t good enough and they might not amount
to anything.</p>
<p>Yes, finally
I did it. I was able to take the first step and then never looked back. </p>
<p>One thing
led to the other, and today I stand in front of an even bigger challenge, which
is representing Sweden in Miss Global 2014! Today I feel stronger than ever,
and I really believe in myself! I am very nervous, off course. But I don't want
to live my life being scared. This time, I have so many people believing in me,
and I won't stop until I've realised my dreams. </p>
<p>This is my
story about how I went from being a dreamer, to a believer, to an achiever. To
achieve my next goal, I need your support because when I win, you win as well. I
am looking for those friends of mine who believe in my dreams and help me raise
funds so I could contest in Ms Global 2014 to be held in December, 2014. </p>
<p>My victory in Ms Global 2014 will be
the victory for all those girls and boys who were yelled at, laughed at and

</h3>
</div><p>I say ""budding"" because, even though I have been making and selling jewelry for 10 or so years, I am only now beginning to get serious about turning it into a business.  Also - those pictures you see in the collage?  They are only the beginning of what I want to learn to do.  I want to be more professional, more prolific, and ultimately more of an artist, one who provides true things of beauty that ease a troubled world.</p><p>Beads and jewelry have been passions of mine ever since I was a very young child.  I knew when I was nine that I wanted to make and sell art of some sort for a living.  I'm on a fixed income now, and need to create a home-based job.  This is it.  This is what I've decided to become.</p><p>What this means to me - everything.  I am looking to launch an online business, and not only find joy in my work, but create joy for others.  Jewelry helps self-esteem.  It's a natural fact.  If you believe in the metaphysics of rocks and gems, it can even give you a spiritual edge.   I have seen the light in someone's eyes when I have created something for them that they love.  With this store, I will be fulfilling a long-held dream... one that many people seem to think is not possible.</p><p>I am out to prove them wrong, with your help.</p><p>In our economy and financial climate, the importance of handmade and of created jobs is growing.  You would be helping one person to be not only self-supporting, but self-fulfilled... and the joy of that has a ripple effect.  My joy and delight will bring joy and delight to others.  The smiles will be spread around, as will my story.  And it is my hope that this will empower other artists and craftspeople whose beautiful work is waiting to be born.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">I am asking for $1959, enough to finance my work in a very humble way for one year.  Here is how it will be spent:</span></p><ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">$1000 will be spent on supplies.  Sound like a lot?  It's not.  It would allow me to create and introduce one new piece a week for about 10 months.  Many of these would be auctioned off on Facebook, where there are many, many jewelry artists like myself, as well as other interested parties.   This would help me to make a name for myself.

I say ""budding"" because, even though I have been making and selling jewelry for 10 or so years, I am only now beginning to get serious about turning it into a business.  Also - those pictures you see in the collage?  They are only the beginning of what I want to learn to do.  I want to be more professional, more prolific, and ultimately more of an artist, one who provides true things of beauty that ease a troubled world.Beads and jewelry have been passions of mine ever since I was a very young child.  I knew when I was nine that I wanted to make and sell art of some sort for a living.  I'm on a fixed income now, and need to create a home-based job.  This is it.  This is what I've decided to become.What this means to me - everything.  I am looking to launch an online business, and not only find joy in my work, but create joy for others.  Jewelry helps self-esteem.  It's a natural fact.  If you believe in the metaphysics of rocks and gems, it can even give you a spiritual edge.   I have seen the light in someone's eyes when I have created something for them that they love.  With this store, I will be fulfilling a long-held dream... one that many people seem to think is not possible.I am out to prove them wrong, with your help.In our economy and financial climate, the importance of handmade and of created jobs is growing.  You would be helping one person to be not only self-supporting, but self-fulfilled... and the joy of that has a ripple effect.  My joy and delight will bring joy and delight to others.  The smiles will be spread around, as will my story.  And it is my hope that this will empower other artists and craftspeople whose beautiful work is waiting to be born.I am asking for $1959, enough to finance my work in a very humble way for one year.  Here is how it will be spent:
$1000 will be spent on supplies.  Sound like a lot?  It's not.  It would allow me to create and introduce one new piece a week for about 10 months.  Many of these would be auctioned off on Facebook, where there are many, many jewelry artists like myself, as well as other interested parties.   This would help me to make a name for myself. The remainder would go on my web site, once I get it up and running, and from there I will do business in the future.

$144.50 would be spent on a new Canon PowerShot SX130 camera.  The  importance of good photography when selling jewelry online cannot be underestimated.  I have researched cameras and have decided this is the one with the features I need to achieve the quality I want.

$143.13 will go for a printer, so that I can print mailing labels and receipts from home.

$86.91 will pay for a postal scale to help me calculate shipping costs.
$79.00 will buy a six-foot folding table, which I will need to take my jewelry to shows.  This is an important way of supplementing income for hand-created items.

$300 would be spent on a class or two to help me gain new skills.  The classes are fairly inexpensive, but the lists of supplies can be long and pricey.  I have rounded this number off as listing each item would make this document wearisome to read.
$200 will go for business cards and other office supplies.
So there you have it!  My perks?  Here is where it gets exciting.  Everyone who contributes $25 or more gets 25% off my jewelry for a year.  Contribute $100 or more, and you will receive a custom piece designed to your specifications (within the limits of what I have to work with money-wise).  And I will be opening a savings account where I will save the payment from one piece of jewelry a month, and the resulting sum at the end of ten months will be given to charities.  So you will be indirectly contributing to those as well.If I don't realize my whole campaign goal, the funds will be used to do what I can - say, purchase just a few things on my wish list - perhaps just the camera and the classes, or something else important to my goal.But what if the business doesn't take off?  I will be a year smarter, and I will continue to make jewelry.  That won't change.  I will still be committed to bringing happiness to the world with my work.  Your support and what I have learned will be the education that I carry with me as I continue to find venues in which to succeed.I am resilient.  Years of making something out of nothing have taught me that.  I deserve a chance to make a living at what truly fulfills me.  I am worth that.   You are, too!Thank you so much for reading, and for your time.  Please, won't you join me in realizing this venture?",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I focus on making wearable art, and on creating garments that have powerful concepts as well as beauty and wearability. I am inspired by psychological themes as well as colors, shapes and textiles, and hence, my greatest enjoyment comes from creating fashion performances.</p>
<p>I have done many fashion shows over the years, at conventions, NYC nightlife events, Toronto Alternative Fashion week, and even an independently produced show during NY fashion week. However, most of those shows had audiences that were either small, unaware of my involvement, or devoid of fashion industry professionals. And the most important thing in art, fashion, and anything creative, is for the right people to see one's work.</p>
<p>I now have an opportunity to show to an audience of buyers, press, stylists, celebrities and others who are directly relevant to my artistic career goals. </p>
<p>Couture Fashion Week.com states:</p>
<p>""Couture Fashion Week is one of many events that are held in New York City twice a year as part of New York Fashion Week. It is one of the most prestigious events, and the only major fashion week event that actively encourages fashion consumers to attend along with trade buyer and press. Most other events show ready-to-wear designs, CFW shows couture, luxury and high-end fashion.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The money being raised is to pay the cost of being on the runway of Couture Fashion Week, NY. I will be creating my new collection no matter what. However, 8,000 dollars would ensure that I can show to an audience of important people who have never seen my work before. And the reason it costs so much is because everything is included, and would cost a lot more if I had to hire everyone myself. <span>Upon being accepted I was informed that:</span></p>
<p>""All shows include models, makeup, hair styling, dressers, backstage racks, hangers, steamers, press release distribution, audience, press, buyer invites, photography, photos post on CFW web site, a number of complementary seats for your VIP guests, red carpet photo op, interviews, show promotion, show production, professional light and sound, and raw non-edited video with at least 2 camera angles.""</p>
<p>In order to help me reach this goal, I'm offering a lot of really great perks for the same or similar price points as I would sell my work in any other avenue. It makes this a perfect opportunity to obtain pieces of my work, and give them as holiday gifts.</p>
<p>Since many of the smaller items are things I either have made in excess, or can produce easily, I'm open to giving multiples for higher donation amounts. For instance, If you wanted to donate $100, but instead of a pair of wings, you wanted two bullet shell accessories to give as presents, just let me know! I'm also open to customization of perks, so if you have any questions or requests, please drop me a line!</p>
<p>Any amount that I raise will help. Since I am using Indiegogo's ""flexible funding"" option, I will be able to receive it, even if I don't reach my goal, and it will go straight to paying the fees for fashion week. I have set the amount for exactly enough to pay for the cheapest option in Couture Fashion Week NY, enabling me to have 15 models, and 15 outfits. </p>
<p>If I make more than my goal, I will be putting it into an account to fund my fashion week endeavors for next season!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I have always fantasized that my creative work will eventually financially support me. I feel that this opportunity will enable my work to be seen by people who have the power to make that dream a reality. Also just as important is the fact that if this fundraiser is successful, it means that everyone who donates will now own a piece of my work. And the more people who have my designs in their lives, the better!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you cannot contribute financially, there are still lots of ways you can help! The most important is to share this link. Share with friends, family, and anyone who seems particularly influential in art and fashion. Getting my work out there is just as important as being backed financially. </p>
<p>Donations of things other than money would also be appreciated. Email me if you have any fabric or sewing supplies, or high heeled shoes (5 inches or higher) that you would like to get rid of, and see used in my collections.</p>
<p>I am extremely thankful to everyone who has been supportive of my work! I would not be where I am right now without you, and I thank you for helping me to further my art and my career!</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The inspiration behind the Pagalli Project- Vincente Pagalli
– was an Italian leather craftsman who emigrated from Italy to South East Asia
in order to find his calling. An adventurer and entrepreneur, Pagalli had a
genuine passion to create high quality leather accessories that were beautiful,
functional and made with consciously sourced materials. He possessed real skill
and talent, along with the drive and courage to share these gifts and help others.
His unwavering dedication to producing quality products empowered him to go
from rags to riches – while positively impacting the lives of those he met
along the way. Inspired by Pagalli, we too are driven by a love for the things
we create – and the people they will touch.</p>

Under the skilled hands of the tanner, using pure water and a large helping of patience, the raw hide is transformed into high-quality leather. Soluble dyes give the leather its color and surface structure. Marchesa Premium is a semi-aniline leather, which means that it maintains the leather’s characteristic grain and adds a protective top coat for additional resistance to wear.</p>
<p>Marchesa Premium leather is distinguished by its unique warmth, soft yet tough texture, and distinctive fragrance that invokes a feeling of luxury.</p>

born in Dedougou, Burkina Faso. While growing up, he worked with his parents
and siblings on their small farm. The family was very poor and Gomsa never had the
opportunity to attend school but taught himself to read and write basic French (the
official language of Burkina Faso) while spending time with literate friends.
In 1998, Gomsa started a small business in Dedougou with his brother sewing
cotton mattresses. When cotton prices plummeted in 2008, Gomsa was forced to
leave his home in search of work. </span></p><p>

He moved to Banfora in southern Burkina where he found employment at SN
SOSUCO, a sugar factory. He worked 8-hour days loading trucks but the $3/day
income was barely enough to live, so he began making sandals from discarded

the sugar factory and he started working full-time making and repairing sandals

by Gomsa, a local artisan, and a Peace Corps volunteer as a way to accelerate
positive change in the community. Through the transformative power of business,
La Vie Chère provides employment at a living wage and invests in children’s
education while removing trash from the environment.
Our Impact
La Vie Chère has already made a meaningful impact in our
home city, Banfora:


Environment: We’ve
turned hundreds of old tires into flip flops and innertubes into bags.
Everything we create removes waste from the streets and most of our products
are 100% recycled. 


Employment &
Training: We’ve hired and trained women and high school interns to provide meaningful
work at a wage to support their education and families.


Children’s Education:
A portion of each sale is given as scholarships to children at risk of dropping out of school.
We’ve already helped several girls continue their education and as the business
grows, we can ensure even more students stay in school.


With your help
we can do even more! 
In Burkina, a little bit goes a long way. Every donation changes the lives of Gomsa, women and students in the community. With your help,
we can bring more amazing recycled products to the world and increase our community
impact. We’ll use $800 to purchase a permanent workspace and boutique with
electricity, $400 for a new sewing machine and $300 for a smartphone to quickly
process orders. The remaining funds will be used for designing new products,
increasing capacity and improving manufacturing processes.

Plus we used super high-quality materials so it will last you a really long time.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/081/691/12645a0689ef15e31d4ff7d4fd68a68d_original.jpg?v=1450226872&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=bb2a9fe07e339e085b3095bee90746cd"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/222/364/16639100bbccde757939efb880c555f8_original.jpg?v=1453327213&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=078568e5af7551cda52afdd6c9cef92a"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/222/469/12645a0689ef15e31d4ff7d4fd68a68d_original.jpg?v=1453328199&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=87f7a870db526530158f9c7b97283ac7"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""383"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/151579201"" style=""margin:0px;padding:0px;border-width:0px;font-family: inherit;font-style: inherit;font-variant: inherit;line-height: inherit;vertical-align: baseline;width: 680px;height: 382.5px;"" title=""KP Duffle Video 2"" width=""680""></iframe></div><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/222/375/12645a0689ef15e31d4ff7d4fd68a68d_original.jpg?v=1453327313&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=8a900ef3e475d0faac84fbc5f34092c4"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/183/413/16639100bbccde757939efb880c555f8_original.jpg?v=1452639263&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=12d22be3f2e8aa04a36a831f3a32c86d"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/081/695/22613200ffc2db6358e2b2b3631a2164_original.jpg?v=1450226896&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=0706d3f07d44c1eaa3fc99df9ce5c14e"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/161/681/c4b282d26f0035097671d625816e53f0_original.jpg?v=1452194500&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=e471a7b860b29ccc81d54fda597825b4"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/081/053/d782603454a428d4c9b4ab60b2c5ca51_original.jpg?v=1450218653&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=c0babae6e09e61cc5147821838e15b70"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p>Dimensions: 9""L x 21.5""W x 10.5""D (Inches) / 23L x 55W x 27D (CM)</p><p>Weight: 3 lb / 1.36 kg</p><p>Capacity: 24 liter</p><ul>

This was our inspiration for our newest bag; KP Duffle. We wanted to make a bag that not only had a stunning appearance but offered functionality/performance that was second to none.The Kickstarter community pledged over $600K to help us get this project off the ground. We want to extend pre-order savings to the IndieGogo community!Most duffle bags on the market either have a square or cylinder shape but for the KP Duffle we wanted to create something that has never been seen before in travel bags. We wanted the shape of the bag to evoke the same feelings you get when you see a Ferrari speeding down the highway.However we also paid as much attention to how the bag functions as we did how it looks. With custom features like a ventilated shoe compartment, utility hatch, internal mesh pockets, etc. this bag is chocked full of awesomeness. Plus we used super high-quality materials so it will last you a really long time.Dimensions: 9""L x 21.5""W x 10.5""D (Inches) / 23L x 55W x 27D (CM)Weight: 3 lb / 1.36 kgCapacity: 24 liter

 The Secret CompartmentWe've designed a passport sized secret compartment somewhere in the Duffle to store your important belongings. This compartment is so hidden that it's virtually invisible. We can't release the location of the secret compartment here, because then it wouldn’t be a secret anymore. Detail information can be found on our update #8 (Backers Only).The KP Dopp Kit was designed to perfectly fit inside the KP Duffle. This sleek bathroom bag is made of a high-quality PU leather exterior and has a bright interior featuring multiple mesh pockets. Keep your gels, pastes and everything else you need to get ready for the day neatly organized, while also keeping everything outside of the Dopp Kit protected from potential leaks.KP is all about good design that makes your life easier.

<p><u>Running test of one blind volunteer with AngelEye</u>      <u> Obstacle avoidance test </u></p>
<p>According to the report of World Health Organization, there are ~285 million visually impaired people including 40 million blind among the world. Walking in an outdoor/indoor environment is one of people’s basic needs, but the blind people takes more safety risks. It’s not safe enough for the blind people going out only by holding the canes, as there are many kinds of obstacles outdoor that are hard to be detected by canes, such as low hanging tree branches, back of a truck, pits, unexpected downstairs etc. Many blind people have experiences of fall, collision and scratches. These challenges have been influencing blind people’s daily life for a long time. To recognize what’s ahead, or to find a remote-control from a desk, or to find a door from the room, is another typical challenge for blind people, who have suffered a lot from these inconveniences.</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>It is to be noted that, AngelEye can only work when connected with smartphone through USB cable. Also, AngelEye is to simulate the functionality of the human eyes, and has similar requirement of the luminance. Strong light or darkness would reduce the sight of the device, and the device would report the “seen” results more conservatively due to the consideration of user’s safety. Therefore, we solemnly remind consumers that the device is to assist people to perceive the surroundings but cannot replace the user to make the judge of actions. Visually impaired still need make their own judgment of the surroundings and take the appropriate action, based on all the information perceived.</p>

<h3>What is Queen's Addiction?</h3>
<p>Queen's Addiction is a company meant for people who want to look as fabulous as they feel at an affordable price. It is a company that will grow to supply clothing and accessories across all genders and expressions, insuring confidence though hand made products with a seamster with over 5 years of experience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make this company a reality, we need money. Hopefully yours! Here's where your money will go:</p>
<ul><li>All contributed money will go towards supplies: nail bases, polish, dress forms, machinery, etc.</li></ul>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we won't be able to start this with the bang it deserves and will cause the rollout of product to slow down! Make sure to check out the perks!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This company came from a few frustrations, largely current retail prices vs. quality. There are plenty of stores out there, but how many have a price-point that really justifies the quality you're getting? Moreover, how many are both affordable and durable?​</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting a new business is difficult for anyone, especially in a heavily saturated market of consumers who prefer cost value to quality; however, when marketing online through social media as well as consistently appearing in public with my own product, one can truly impress quality standards in a way that cannot be said through major marketed brands.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot afford to contribute, we understand; however, you can still help greatly! SHARE this on social media and make sure to hashtag away and make sure to tag @QueensaddictionNYC</p>

<p>Our favorite digital characters are intricately designed with details that compliment figure while telling a story of their personality. Armor panels that defend the wearer while presenting strength and the silhouette of a warrior are details that empower us. Our gear features not only everyday utility such as functional pockets and adjustable, modular components; but also bold details, powerful silhouettes, and interchangeable patches to express your personal style. Action isn’t just something you do; it’s something you wear.</p>

Furthermore, we utilize the hook and loop Velcro platform to give our wearers an opportunity to personalize their gear with morale patches that represent the wearer’s own unique style.</p>

<p><br/>As our favorite forms of digital media culture have inspired us to create, we strive to inspire others to do the same. The progression of the arts is the progression of our culture and society. With that in mind we take responsibility in creating art that has a positive empowering message. ""Seize the Future"" is the baseline for this campaign as our creations remind us to reach for the future we want for ourselves and others.</p>

<p><br/>Infinite Future Gear was created as a message of empowerment. To serve as a reminder that our Future is Infinite in its possibilities. We take ownership of our name and we are giving back to our community to ensure a bright future for all of us and for the generations to come.<br/>This Kickstart the Future campaign not only brings the future of street wear, but also gives back to our local children, veterans and service members, as well as to newborns in need. For most of the rewards backed, we are donating supplies and materials that enrich the quality of life for those who have not had the same opportunities as we have. To our servicemen and servicewomen we are donating one for one of our Infinite Caps. To those overseas, or to our domestic retired veterans, and their families we offer these caps as a small token of our gratitude for your service. We hope these caps will shield you from the sun and keep you inspired of the Infinite Future. To the children who may not have the means to create art, we offer art supplies through our Infinite Sagas items so that they may continue to dream of the Future. To the newborns of the Future who are in need, we create blankets from our unused materials to ensure that every newborn has the basic necessity of keeping warm. Make sure to check each reward description to see what items are being donated to the Future.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hi that me @Magic Apparel Trade show Las Vegas 2018 Infinite Future Gear booth</p>
<ul>
<li>Hello! My name is Dayne Nastri. I am a 25 year old designer from Orange County, California. I I grew up playing iconic video games like Starfox 64, The Legend of Zelda, and Kingdom Hearts. I played these games with my family and friends and was captivated by the creativity of these fantasy characters and their worlds. From battling colossi, to slaying nightmares, playing these games that presented otherwise insurmountable obstacles gave me a sense of empowerment while enabling me to build friendships with others who shared the same passion for games. In 2015 my friends and I had the idea to create a streetwear clothing line that embodied the same heroic and empowering designs of our favorite games. We started with the Infinite Hoodie, inspired by Kingdom Hearts. The hoodies were a hit and demand for new products increased. Since then Infinite Future Gear has expanded to T-shirts, denim, and accessories all inspired by my favorite digital passions. I look to infinitely expand IFG throughout digital culture as a mainstay apparel brand. I am a former Apple employee and have over 5 years of retail and customer service experience.</li>
<li>With your contribution we will build the Future with the innovative style and functionality necessary to advance out culture and society.</li>

<h3><i>What We Need &amp; What You Get</i></h3>

<li>Perks! Our perks include our one of a kind hand made items, as well as limited bundles available only on our crowdfunding platforms.

The Future of Street Wear
The Denim Oblivion Jacket
Infinite Future Gear, customizable street wear inspired by video games, sci-fi, and electronic music.
Streamline design and bold details are the style of the Future.
Our mission is to create the most innovative street wear apparel that inspires others to Seize the Future.
Infinite Future Gear is here to disrupt the apparel industry with custom hand made in the USA garments inspired by our passions.
Our products are inspired from our favorite forms of digital art such as video games, sci-fi, and electronic music. These artistic mediums are our source of imagination and creativity that empower us to chase our dreams and pursue IFG.

Heroic Styling

Tripher shirt and Gunslinger Pants in grey
Our favorite digital characters are intricately designed with details that compliment figure while telling a story of their personality. Armor panels that defend the wearer while presenting strength and the silhouette of a warrior are details that empower us. Our gear features not only everyday utility such as functional pockets and adjustable, modular components; but also bold details, powerful silhouettes, and interchangeable patches to express your personal style. Action isn’t just something you do; it’s something you wear.
Applicable Functionality
Superior style and function
In outfitting the Future we will need functionality and utility to match the progression of our digitally inspired style. Our gear takes your daily needs and activities into consideration with bold details that are innovative to street wear. Our functional designs include pockets specific for your mobile devices, wallets, and keys. We also incorporate adjustable and modular components that change the fit and profile of a garment. Furthermore, we utilize the hook and loop Velcro platform to give our wearers an opportunity to personalize their gear with morale patches that represent the wearer’s own unique style.
Gunslinger Pants have holsters made just for your devices
The distinct combination of our heroic styling with applicable functionality enables and empowers our wearers to have the confidence to accomplish their daily goals; in pursuit of their Future aspirations.
Creativity and Imagination
Infinite Sagas Vol. 1 & 2 Graphic T-shirts
As our favorite forms of digital media culture have inspired us to create, we strive to inspire others to do the same. The progression of the arts is the progression of our culture and society. With that in mind we take responsibility in creating art that has a positive empowering message. ""Seize the Future"" is the baseline for this campaign as our creations remind us to reach for the future we want for ourselves and others.
Giving Back
 Infinite Future Gear strives to create an Infinite Future for others
Infinite Future Gear was created as a message of empowerment. To serve as a reminder that our Future is Infinite in its possibilities. We take ownership of our name and we are giving back to our community to ensure a bright future for all of us and for the generations to come.This Kickstart the Future campaign not only brings the future of street wear, but also gives back to our local children, veterans and service members, as well as to newborns in need. For most of the rewards backed, we are donating supplies and materials that enrich the quality of life for those who have not had the same opportunities as we have. To our servicemen and servicewomen we are donating one for one of our Infinite Caps. To those overseas, or to our domestic retired veterans, and their families we offer these caps as a small token of our gratitude for your service. We hope these caps will shield you from the sun and keep you inspired of the Infinite Future. To the children who may not have the means to create art, we offer art supplies through our Infinite Sagas items so that they may continue to dream of the Future. To the newborns of the Future who are in need, we create blankets from our unused materials to ensure that every newborn has the basic necessity of keeping warm. Make sure to check each reward description to see what items are being donated to the Future.

In the beginning, it was just a discussion between three friends about their common love for watches. Later on, it became more serious and we began to focus on how most part of the watches on today’s market are designed. We had to find a space in the market, something unique. My friend and now business partner, said ""Let's do a 24-hour watch!"".</p><p>When scanning the market, we noticed that there is only a few brands that makes a fully dedicated 24-hour watches. And most of them have too many functions or are designed in a way that makes it hard to actually tell the time.</p><p>We started to work on the design and the search for suppliers that could handle it.</p><p>After endless meetings and discussions, we landed in a clean design. We also found a supplier that was professional and fully understood our project.</p><p>The first samples were produced and tested. The choice of the 24-hour Swiss made movement was great, but we had to work harder on the case design, glass and hands.</p><p>Back to the design, ""Let's apply some 60's vintage design on the case and glass!"". The result became this beautiful double dome glass, curved minute hand and dial Åkerfalk Watch.</p><p>We use the best materials and the finish in our price segment. With Apple in mind, we aim super high when it comes to build quality and finish. We now feel that we have found a gape in the market with our First Season Åkerfalk Watch, one unique 24-hour timepiece.</p><h2>The Team</h2><p>Rickard Åkerfalk has his background in the invention industry. He has been fascinated by inventions since he was a kid, he loves bringing new inventions to life and making old ones better.

It’s very easy to change strap with our quick release system. Store them in our leather travel case. Trendy Milanese strap for everyday use. Classic Italian calf leather for the late-night dinner. Rugged mocha with it’s nice texture that will age beautiful. All watches come with one extra Nato strap for all your adventures.Choose your watch combination once the campaign is overThere is a special perk for each strap quality. Make sure to get your favorite!The StoryThis project started almost 2 years ago. In the beginning, it was just a discussion between three friends about their common love for watches. Later on, it became more serious and we began to focus on how most part of the watches on today’s market are designed. We had to find a space in the market, something unique. My friend and now business partner, said ""Let's do a 24-hour watch!"".When scanning the market, we noticed that there is only a few brands that makes a fully dedicated 24-hour watches. And most of them have too many functions or are designed in a way that makes it hard to actually tell the time.We started to work on the design and the search for suppliers that could handle it.After endless meetings and discussions, we landed in a clean design. We also found a supplier that was professional and fully understood our project.The first samples were produced and tested. The choice of the 24-hour Swiss made movement was great, but we had to work harder on the case design, glass and hands.Back to the design, ""Let's apply some 60's vintage design on the case and glass!"". The result became this beautiful double dome glass, curved minute hand and dial Åkerfalk Watch.We use the best materials and the finish in our price segment. With Apple in mind, we aim super high when it comes to build quality and finish. We now feel that we have found a gape in the market with our First Season Åkerfalk Watch, one unique 24-hour timepiece.The TeamRickard Åkerfalk has his background in the invention industry. He has been fascinated by inventions since he was a kid, he loves bringing new inventions to life and making old ones better. He likes problems (yes it does sound crazy), but it’s from the problems that ideas come to life. When we create the Åkerfalk Watch we had a big problem...the lack of time!We all have our days filled with work, kids, family and friends. Our days just didn´t last long enough.

I am a hat designer, also known as a milliner, based in Chicago, IL.  I produce bespoke, couture and ready-to-wear hats for men and women.

This collection will be made in Chicago, IL, USA! </p>
<p>Recently, I was selected by <a href=""http://zappos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zappos.com</a> for its 2013 <a href=""http://www.zappos.com/emerging-designer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Emerging Designer Program</a>, a program initiated by <a href=""http://zappos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zappos.com</a> employees to promote up-and-coming designers like myself.  In March of 2013, my Tonya Gross Millinery CAPSule Collection for the <a href=""http://zappos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zappos.com</a> Emerging Designer Program will be prominently featured by <a href=""http://zappos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zappos.com</a> through an online boutique, and through social media and marketing campaigns. I am thrilled for the opportunity to partner with such a prominent online retailer like <a href=""http://zappos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zappos.com</a>, and so honored by this distinction.

<p> </p>
<p>This is a unique venture in that I will produce handmade, ready-to-wear hats for a large volume online retailer that are<strong> locally produced</strong> and plan to hire and train a talented team drawn from the<strong> Chicago fashion industry</strong>; I am really proud of this.  But, I need your help to raise the funds to produce my line of handmade hats.</p>
<p>Your contribution to my campaign will allow me to:</p>
<ul>
<li>purchase hat foundation materials &amp; trims to complete a large volume order for Zappos.com</li>
<li>initiate a hiring and training program for MITs-- aka Milliners in Training</li>

<li>fulfill the PERKS for this campaign that reflect the best of my Zappos.com collection!</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe my project is significant for the following reasons:  </p>
<ul>
<li>I will bring US-made quality, hand-finished couture and ready-to-wear head wear to a large, online global marketplace</li>
<li>I can increase the number of job opportunities for skilled labor in apparel manufacturing in the Midwest</li>
<li>Create training programs and employ a talented pool of skilled individuals that will earn a living wage</li>
<li>I will act as a catalyst to restore the tradition of hat manufacturing in Chicago- much like BesBen, Raymond Hudd and Mr John</li>
<li>I will successfully fulfill the order and encourage a large online retailer to take a chance on a small business rather than import from a mass-production facility outside of the US</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, I tried and failed to make my goal on another crowdfunding site around the holidays-- bad timing on my part.  It was an all or nothing platform; therefore, I have initiated this Indiegogo campaign because the need to fund my collection still exists.  Note:  I did secure a relationship with a shipping vendor that will significantly lower my overhead (and have lowered my goal accordingly.) </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>While traveling the world I discovered European hosiery. I fell in love with the complex pattens, the variety of colors and the unique ornaments. After years of searching for the same great variety you can find in any Drug Store or Monoprix or small boutique in countries like France, Italy and even Turkey in the States.  I began searching around for the same selection. But, much to my chagrin I couldn't find what I wanted. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After collecting over 300 pairs of tights, hold-ups and stockings, I decided to showcase my hosiery collection on a blog ""whomovedmybirkin.blogspot.com."" Within a few months, the blog was attracting many interested visitors who often wanted to know where I purchased the hosiery that I focused on in my entries. Soon I decided the next best step was to connect the dots - put the interested parties in touch with the interesting hosiery! Which is what lead me to this project on Indie GO GO, in an effort to start an on-line retail boutique that brings the best hosiery from around the world to stylish, yet bare-legged Americans!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I will be launching PEEK in September of 2011. PEEK will specialize in making European styles of hosiery available to an untapped American market. It will also allow me to survey the interests of this market with hope of one day developing my own line!! I believe there are many women out there who share in my frustration when looking for unique pieces of hosiery. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise some capital to make my first stock purchases at the upcoming trade expo, Curve NY, in August. I have everything else under control thanks to my loving friends and family who have donated their creative efforts, just need some funds to build inventory. That's where you come in.<br/></p>
<p>  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that asking to donate money is a lot to ask of people. So if you have any other talents that I can use in building my empire I would be happy to work out a trade!! </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">KARIGAR (meaning ‘artisan’ in Hindi) is a brand of textile products for
the global conscious consumer. Through our Home and Fashion range, we showcase
the skills, craft and heritage of rural artisans, using contemporary design.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At KARIGAR we respect nature as much as the people we work with, and so we
use natural materials (wild forest silk, nettle, wool, cotton) to create our
products. We currently work with highly skilled, rural artisans from villages
across North and South India to co-create textile products for the
international market. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our frequent travels to India allow us to meet inspiring and talented artisans
– we identify craft groups, train them on new designs and skills and provide
them with regular work, which gives them a steady source of income.</p>

<p>India’s rich textile heritage makes it the ideal playground for
us to build on a handmade design collection.</p>
<p>And since two of KARIGAR’S partners are Indians by birth and the
third is an Indian at heart, our journey started here – showcasing some of the
best craft that its people have to offer.</p>
<p>We are a young brand, having launched only in October 2014 at
Dutch Design Week (Netherlands), and we’ve already seen the impact of our
handcrafted, contemporary products – loved and handled with care both by the
people who buy, and those who create them. KARIGAR is retailing in the
Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and UK. And we need you to grow this brand
globally!</p>
<p><i><u><b>Design innovation</b></u></i></p>
<p>Tangram Textiles is the design concept for the KARIGAR
collection. Patterns for weaving and embroidery are inspired by geometrical
shapes of the ancient Tangram puzzle in an endless play of abstract
decorations.</p>
<p>This play is also how we approaches our collaboration with
artisans – matching form, material, colour, handwork, ancient traditions and
contemporary designs. We are driven by the belief that whole is greater than
the sum of its parts – and just like pieces of a puzzle come together to form a
complete picture, we too collaborate with artisans and our clients to create
beautiful products. And by purchasing a KARIGAR product, conscious consumers
acknowledge and embrace the unique beauty of craftsmanship and help complete
the puzzle.</p>

<p><b><b><i><u>The big picture</u></i></b></b></p>
<p>Our campaign is the first step to
make a difference <span>on a global scale. We want to
make people in different parts of the world aware of our brand, our beautiful
products and the capabilities of the people creating them.</span></p>
<p><u>Platform:</u> Our vision is to build a
platform of expert, local artisans around the world, where their traditional
skills are translated into ethical, sustainable, high fashion products for a
conscious consumer like you.</p>
<p><u>Design and Quality:</u> Most rural craftsmen have a small
marketplace for their ethnic products. They sell locally and by making the same
product over and over again they unknowingly limit themselves in what they can create. By exposing them
to new designs and re-training them, getting them to push their own creative
boundaries and in improving their quality standards, we give their skills a much-needed
boost and open up a world of possibilities. </p>
<p><u>Use of technology:</u> For many artisans in remote
villages, the full capability of technology remains limited. By linking
technology with design and craft, we connect you to our <i>karigars</i> (artisans) and
our products, with the click of a button. Already, the chief artisan whom we interact with daily has been given a smartphone by us. This allows us to stay in touch and updated with what's happening on the production site. In the future, we wish to create an app whereby each of these artisans will record and document each stage of the process that automatically links to our web server.   </p>

KARIGAR (meaning ‘artisan’ in Hindi) is a brand of textile products for
the global conscious consumer. Through our Home and Fashion range, we showcase
the skills, craft and heritage of rural artisans, using contemporary design.
At KARIGAR we respect nature as much as the people we work with, and so we
use natural materials (wild forest silk, nettle, wool, cotton) to create our
products. We currently work with highly skilled, rural artisans from villages
across North and South India to co-create textile products for the
international market. 
Our frequent travels to India allow us to meet inspiring and talented artisans
– we identify craft groups, train them on new designs and skills and provide
them with regular work, which gives them a steady source of income.

OUR REWARDS:Choose from our many rewards to treat yourself to a beautifully designed, finely crafted product, while making a difference to the lives of our artisans.You can also gift your loved one something they will remember forever! Pre-order your KARIGAR product now to impact lives and #wearsharethebeauty!____________________________________________________________________________  Impact a 'karigar' €25,-Sponsor the health insurance for one of our weavers or help educate a child of an artisan through this reward.

India’s rich textile heritage makes it the ideal playground for
us to build on a handmade design collection.
And since two of KARIGAR’S partners are Indians by birth and the
third is an Indian at heart, our journey started here – showcasing some of the
best craft that its people have to offer.
We are a young brand, having launched only in October 2014 at
Dutch Design Week (Netherlands), and we’ve already seen the impact of our
handcrafted, contemporary products – loved and handled with care both by the
people who buy, and those who create them. KARIGAR is retailing in the
Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and UK. And we need you to grow this brand
globally!
Design innovation
Tangram Textiles is the design concept for the KARIGAR
collection. Patterns for weaving and embroidery are inspired by geometrical
shapes of the ancient Tangram puzzle in an endless play of abstract
decorations.
This play is also how we approaches our collaboration with
artisans – matching form, material, colour, handwork, ancient traditions and
contemporary designs. We are driven by the belief that whole is greater than
the sum of its parts – and just like pieces of a puzzle come together to form a
complete picture, we too collaborate with artisans and our clients to create
beautiful products. And by purchasing a KARIGAR product, conscious consumers
acknowledge and embrace the unique beauty of craftsmanship and help complete
the puzzle.


Taa-daa! We present you the
Talking Tag
Imagine if your wardrobe could
speak. What do you think would it say? Would it tell you about mass produced clothes
or would it speak about garments where the makers gave it unique attention to
detail? 
Imagine if you could find out
about the exact materials that were used to create your garments? About who
made it, how long it took to make, where was it made and the technique used? More
importantly, would that be something you want to know?

As creators of beautiful textile
products, we want to empower consumers and retailers by making our production
process transparent. With the help of simple technology, we make the people in
the production chain visible and give you as much information as possible about
your product. 
In this collection, we introduce the
Talking Tag - a hang tag with a unique QR code per product. All you need to do
is scan the code with your smartphone (you need to download any QR code reader
app) to find out details of the people who’ve helped give life to your KARIGAR
product – for example the name of the people who dyed
the yarn, drafted the design and created your scarf. You can also see pictures and
videos that will document the creation. 
Each KARIGAR product has its own story that we want you to know and share with your friends and family through your social media.


The big picture
Our campaign is the first step to
make a difference on a global scale. We want to
make people in different parts of the world aware of our brand, our beautiful
products and the capabilities of the people creating them.
Platform: Our vision is to build a
platform of expert, local artisans around the world, where their traditional
skills are translated into ethical, sustainable, high fashion products for a
conscious consumer like you.
Design and Quality: Most rural craftsmen have a small
marketplace for their ethnic products. They sell locally and by making the same
product over and over again they unknowingly limit themselves in what they can create. By exposing them
to new designs and re-training them, getting them to push their own creative
boundaries and in improving their quality standards, we give their skills a much-needed
boost and open up a world of possibilities. 
Use of technology: For many artisans in remote
villages, the full capability of technology remains limited. By linking
technology with design and craft, we connect you to our karigars (artisans) and
our products, with the click of a button. Already, the chief artisan whom we interact with daily has been given a smartphone by us. This allows us to stay in touch and updated with what's happening on the production site. In the future, we wish to create an app whereby each of these artisans will record and document each stage of the process that automatically links to our web server.   











The people behind KARIGAR

In the Netherlands: Jolijn Fiddelaers  (left) is the Dutch design
brain and spends time in training the artisans on design translation and
quality. Kanak Hirani Nautiyal (middle) handles sales and identifies new retailers who wish to add an ethical brand to
their store. Sindhu Holla (right) handles production and ensures that the design brief is well executed and the production goes smoothly. All three are based in the Netherlands but travel frequently to
India and spend time with the karigars.



In India: We identify and work with
skilled rural artisans across villages in India. We look for independent
weavers, weaving clusters or groups of artisans who specialise in weaving and
embroidery, whom we train and work closely with to co-create textile products. Most
of the weavers and embroiders that we work with are women. Working on our
designs gives them an opportunity to learn a new skill, become financially
independent or send their children to school. 





How to be our Ambassador of
change
We need €30.000 to achieve the following:

1.  Produce our next KARIGAR collection.
2.  Reach out to new markets (through international trade shows,
through our web store).
3.  Help find and train more artisans to join our mission.

You can help us raise that amount
by pre-ordering from our rewards suitable for consumers as well as retailers who
wish to add an ethical brand to their stores. Additionally, we also offer the
opportunity to design a space with made-to-measure
textile artworks.
How will we use the funds 
By supporting our campaign and
helping us reach our funding goal, you impact the lives of the 1,000 karigars
that we work with. You not only give them a chance to learn a new skill, but
you also help them become financially independent and showcase their craft at a
global level.
With €15,000 we will travel to
the villages in North and South India to start work on your pre-orders, documenting the story of how they come alive through videos and pictures.
Once created, each product will have a Talking
Tag, a hang tag with a QR code that you need to simply scan to learn who
made your product and how it was made. 
With €25,000 we begin the
production of Tangram Textiles, our
next collection that will be showcased at international
trade fairs, where it will
receive global attention from retailers. Exploring new markets for our
beautiful products and getting more orders will lead to more employment for our
karigars (artisans). We will identify 2 new craft groups who will be trained
by us to develop new products for the Tangram Textiles collection, and be part
of our platform.
With €30,000 we can then launch
our Webshop and reach out to global
conscious consumers interested in beautifully designed, carefully crafted
products.
When you order a KARIGAR product,
artisans in remote villages are gainfully employed and earn a fair wage. When
our orders multiply, so does their income.

everywhere.  Independent designers
must do everything themselves, from designing the clothes, producing the
clothes and then selling the clothes. 
Small cities like Charleston, lack the infrastructure needed to support a
growing fashion scene.  Currently
there is not fashion industry in Charleston, which forces designers to travel
far distances to develop their designs.  Another alternative is for designers to own a small company.  This puts stress on their creative resources.  Designers must rely on the fading cottage industry or do everything themselves.

the past 7+ years.  I am also the owner and creator of The Rose Knot, a clothing alteration shop.     The Rose Knot has become a hub of creativity so much so that I now spend time helping local clothing designers develop and produce their collections.  My dream is to turn The Rose Knot into a design resource center for local fashion designers to develop, create and produce well-made clothing.  This resource center will be called the Charleston Garment Manufactory.  Many of the designers I currently work with are showing their collections at Charleston Fashion Week, which has become one of the premiere fashion weeks in North America since its founding in 2007.  The Charleston Garment Manufactory will work closely with the already existing foundation of local designers to expand Charleston as a center of creativity, fashion and style, while strengthening community through education.  I will educate future seamstresses and I will educate designers to elevate the quality of their work.   
 
Phase I: The Idea
I would like to take The Rose Knot, a small sewing workroom
and turn it into the Charleston Garment Manufactory, an educational center for clothing design and
manufacturing.  The dream is to
create a resource for fashion designers and individuals to use in developing
and producing their clothing.  This
resource center would offer the following services:
Design consultations
Pattern drafting
Sample garment construction
Sewing classes and workshops
 
The Impact
There is an obstacle right now for independent designers
everywhere.  Independent designers
must do everything themselves, from designing the clothes, producing the
clothes and then selling the clothes. 
Small cities like Charleston, lack the infrastructure needed to support a
growing fashion scene.  Currently
there is not fashion industry in Charleston, which forces designers to travel
far distances to develop their designs.  Another alternative is for designers to own a small company.  This puts stress on their creative resources.  Designers must rely on the fading cottage industry or do everything themselves. Not only will the Charleston Garment Manufactory strengthen
the community by creating jobs, but will continue the education of a dying art
and help expand Charleston into a center of forward thinking in fashion and
style.
 
The Funding
A portion of the money raised
from this campaign will be used to renovate a building, located in
downtown Charleston.  Some of the funds raised will go towards 2 straight stitch industrial machines, 1
industrial serger sewing machine and professional fabric cutting tools.  Most importantly, a portion of the money
will go towards a training program for future seamstresses.  The Charleston Garment Manufactory will employ 3 full
time seamstresses, 1 full time pattern drafter and 1 production coordinator.  
 
Phase II: Room to Grow   
Once The Charleston Garment Manufactory is
established there will be room to expand. 
The ultimate dream is to create a full on manufacturing facility.  This manufacturing facility will
specialize in the production of womenâ€™s and children's cut and sew apparel for a larger number
of local and regional designers. 
The goal is to grow the company to employ 5 full time seamstresses, 1 sample
sewer, 2 cutters, 2 pattern drafters, and 1 production coordinator.  The manufacturing facility would offer all of the same services as listed above but would include:Pattern GradingCut and Sew woven apparelCut and Sew knit apparel 
 
 
Lets Dream Together
I want to thank you for all of
the support I have received during this campaign.  This dream would not become a reality with out the support
of each and everyone of you.  If the Charleston Garment Manufactory inspires you, please tell a friend about this
project.  I am looking for help of
all kinds, whether it by a donation of money, time, or possibly a future employ
of the Charleston Garment Manufactory.  Donâ€™t you love
the idea of living in a place where you can find clothing designed and made
right in your own town?Music in video Courtesy of

Sweaty feet are one of the most unpleasant things to experience - whether it's the frustration of your foot sliding around in your shoe, or the embarrassment of trying but failing to hide it from friends, family and colleagues.
With SilverSocks, the meshed, moisture wicking grills pull away any sweat away from our feet leaving them dry and happy all day long. 



 

 
We spend on average 70% of our lives with our feet covered, whether we're wearing socks around the home or additionally, shoes outside the home. We live in unnecessary discomfort with socks that don’t work with our feet.

Sock manufacturers rarely pay attention to the bottom of your socks. They use the same material as the rest of the sock and don't add any reinforcement to combat the weight of your whole body throughout the day.

<p>After years of Research and Development, HaloSmile is now ready for the mass market. Since we produce everything in-house we have the capability to quickly address any concerns or questions. Of course, we promise to communicate promptly and frequently to all of our loyal backers.</p>
</div><div> </div></div>","Ok, we know what you’re thinking...there are so many teeth whitening products on the market. Great, here’s another one. To be clear. We are NOT a peroxide whitening product. 
HaloSmile is the FIRST of its kind. It is a brush on smile cosmetic that will give you a dramatically whiter smile in just minutes. Say whaaaat?HaloSmile is the world’s first patented, consumer-applied teeth coating that will make your teeth appear whiter in under 8 minutes. Our team of experienced scientists, PhDs and,world-renowned scientific advisors have spent over EIGHT years perfecting our teeth whitening technology without using potentially harmful chemicals!How Does The Science Work?HaloSmile contains the calcium-based mineral, hydroxyapatite, which occurs naturally in the body.Your teeth enamel is made of up to 95% hydroxyapatite which means HaloSmile is mimicking your body’s natural chemistry—working with you, not against you.To date, we have completed over 2,000 applications of our product without a single issue!Similar to makeup, HaloSmile lasts a day and can be easily reapplied whenever you want!Don't you already love HaloSmile?HaloSmile can be self-applied, by someone else or by a dental or cosmetic professional.Just Dry, Mix and Apply.Dry your teeth, mix, apply HaloSmile, and wait 2 minutes for it to set. Including set time, it takes less than 8 minutes to achieve a beautiful white smile.HaloSmile creates a smooth, imperceptible layer on your teeth.No Peroxide, Bleach, Harsh Chemicals or Animal By-Products.Within this layer, we have embedded whitening particles that give your teeth a healthy, brighter shine.That's right, we are the first company to successfully whiten teeth without using any form of hydrogen peroxide.HaloSmile is a unique formulation that creates a light and tasteless layer over the surface of your teeth—covering stains rather than removing them.In addition, the coating also prevents staining from coffee, tea, red wine and other foods.Unlike peroxide based products, It does not change the natural state of your teeth, and is free of bleach and harsh chemicals that can penetrate, harm, cause pain, and interfere with your body’s natural processes.Your Rewards Menu.The time is finally here! Back our project today and receive HaloSmile at a special discounted Kickstarter price. Have questions or want to inquire about HaloSmile? Send us an email at support@halosmile.co.Don't Waste Your Time And Money!HaloSmile is affordable and costs a fraction of the price of whitening products on the market. And the results are instant!Stop spending weeks or even months trying to whiten your teeth. Get HaloSmile and whiten them instantly! Don't Take Our Word For It.Just listen to what some folks have to say about our product. :)But seriously, these ladies are so ecstatic about their first HaloSmile experience they can't stop smiling!Even men love HaloSmile!Dentist approved!We have been working closely with dental professionals to ensure our product exceeds their standards and expectations. We succeeded.What's In The Box?The basic HaloSmile Starter Kit contains six treatments. It will take a couple times of applying HaloSmile to get the hang of it.Each HaloSmile Starter Kit comes with 6 Treatments, 1 Bottle of Liquid Activator, 10 Brushes, 1 Mouthpiece, 2 packs of Cotton Rolls, 1 Instruction Card, 1 bottle of Finishing Touch Top Coat and 1 tube of Removal gel.

Liquid Activator - 3 drops is all you need to create our secret formula.

Brushes - Just like a nail polish brush, use it to apply it to your teeth. We include a few extras for practice.

Cotton Rolls - Saliva is not your friend. Keeping your teeth dry is important for a good application.

Mouthpiece - They help you get the hang of applying HaloSmile.

Removal gel - Many people just choose to let the coating naturally fade away in a few days. If you prefer, you can use the removal gel to take it off.
How Do You Apply?HaloSmile provides instant results! You will notice an immediate and dramatic change as you're applying. Pay close attention to how each tooth turns out. You'll only have a small window to retouch or redo each tooth before it sets.These easy how-to-steps are the key to keeping your smile smooth and free of brush strokes.What's In It?Ingredients: Water, Zinc Oxide, Potassium Tripolyphosphate, PAA Hydrochloride Salt, Hydroxyapatite, Aluminum Oxide, Silicon Dioxide, Sodium Chloride, Boron Trioxide, Manganese (II) Oxide, Potassium Chloride, Potassium Oxide, Potassium Phosphate Monobasic, Sodium Oxide, Sodium Phosphate Dibasic, Titanium Dioxide.Covered by 17 U.S. and foreign patents.

Le projet

Fascinées bijoux depuis

Les turquoises, l'argent,

tellement d'éléments captivants que nous pouvons trouver dans
certains lieux, tels que le désert.

Nous aimons les pierres de
turquoise, en particulier certains types de pierres ( la turquoise de
Royston, du lac Carico, la « sleeping beauty », pour n'en
citer que quelques unes). Ce projet est une aventure humaine, une
manière d'explorer, de découvrir la beauté naturelle de la terre,
de rencontrer de réels artistes et de répandre leur travail par
l'intermédiaire d'une boutique en ligne faite de magnifiques
designs.


Comment ?

Notre but est d'explorer
certains lieux des Etats-Unis pour y rencontrer des artistes Navajos
qui créent des bijoux amérindiens authentiques et faits main grâce

car ils renferment certaines mines de turquoises que nous recherchons
mais aussi car nous pouvons y rencontrer les artistes les plus
authentiques. Notre but est également de trouver des bijoux pour
hommes. En effet, le marché des pièces pour hommes est assez
limité.

communiquer à propos
	du lancement par l'intermédiaire des réseaux sociaux (instagram,

rapporter les pièces
	chez nous ( Canada et Etats-Unis), les prendre en photos et les
	insérer dans la boutique en ligne


Ce que votre aide peut
apporter :

L'argent dont nous avons
besoin nous permettra de financer plusieurs étapes :



la création d'un
	site de qualité


la création d'une
	société et les frais que cela engendre


financer deux billets

The Impact
Dark Wallet needs $50k to finish its development and testing.
We hope you will elect to support this open source infrastructure now over waiting for the premium, managed clients of tomorrow.
We are interested in scaling up the Bitcoin infrastructure in an intentionally subversive and empowering direction- taking Bitcoin just where it has been threatening to go. Towards an integrity of values, and a neutrality promoted by anonymity and a resistance to censorship. Software can stand for something.
The unSYSTEM team at the CIC's Calafou live frugally and share a common ideal of investing in common infrastructure. Dark Wallet's funds will after 45 days be transmitted to a multisignature Bitcoin address, publicly viewable on the blockchain, for the coming months of project administration. Administration will be publicly accountable. Should we surpass our goal, surplus funds will be deposited to the same account and used to support unplanned and experimental features within the infrastructure.
