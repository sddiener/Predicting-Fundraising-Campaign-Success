<p><strong> </strong>I have spent a lifetime working with the mentally ill, vulnerable women, war veterans, the infirm, neglected, and the survivors of sexual violence.  I have also written and organized against the prejudices and fears the homeless and mentally ill suffer from.  I have used these experiences to write nine novels, six screenplays and a nonfcition.  I have decided that my writings are my next attempt to broaden the fight, not only for the dignity of the poor but their very lives.  So many are shunted to the streets and are expected to quietly die---unseen and uncared for.  This must come to an end.</p>

That would imply higher expenses for the manuscript editing, cover layout and graphic design and so on. I have to be realistic though.

Does it mean we're done? No way! The campaign continues for another 5 days. You can still contribute, don't stop the good intentions! What will happen to the money? When I set up the campaign, I chose the lowest budget possible, I factored the lowest figures. Now it's time to set the stretching goals! I am considering and exploring the possibility of a print edition instead of an e-book. That would imply higher expenses for the manuscript editing, cover layout and graphic design and so on. I have to be realistic though. So if that doesn't come through, there are lots of projects that could benefit form the donation of the difference. 
Please continue to contribute generously and to spread the word far and wide!


What's this all about? 

My name is Sinziana Carstocea, I am
Romanian and I hold a PhD in social and political sciences from
Université libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. The seeds for this project
are to be found in the dissertation I presented for this title,
entitled La Roumanie – du placard à la libération. Eléments
pour une histoire socio-politique des revendications homosexuelles
dans une société post-communiste. Yes, the fundation for writing
the history of Romanian LGBT (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) exists already, an account of
aproximatevely 400 pages in French, which I plan to translate,
restore, update and include into a more comprehensive English
version.
The dissertation received jury's
unanimous recommendation for publishing. A twist of fate made in
such a way that it has never turned into a book. Translating this
story in English would make it available to a larger and more
concerned audience and give it the visibility it deserves.  Let's
make it happen!

<p>Op zaterdag 23 januari zijn wij, 10 vrouwen van alle
leeftijden, gearresteerd in Spijkenisse bij de actie “Feministen voor verzetsspray”.
Wilders was in Spijkenisse om nep-pepperspray uit te delen aan vrouwen om zich
te beschermen tegen asielzoekers die in Wilders woorden, “islamistische
testosteronbommen” zijn.</p>
<p>Wij spraken ons vreedzaam uit tegen Wilders’ cynische
inzet van vrouwenrechten om zijn agenda van racisme, uitsluiting en haatzaaien
tegen migranten, moslims en vluchtelingen aan te jagen. De politie ontnam ons
het recht om te spreken terwijl Wilders’ aanhangers alle ruimte kregen om ons
seksistische beledigen toe te schreeuwen. Wij weigerden ons de identiferen aan
de politie omdat zij geen grond hadden om dit eisen, en voldoen aan die eis
effectief een einde zou maken aan onze actie. Hierom werden wij aangehouden en
uren vastgehouden, een vrouw zelfs gedurende de hele nacht. Wij zijn beboet
voor het niet opvolgen van een ambtelijk bevel en het weigeren ons (direct) te
identificeren.</p>
<p>Onze advocaat Willem Jebbink is van mening dat beide
aanklachten ongegrond zijn. Wij zullen de arrestatie en deze boetes dan ook
aanvechten voor de rechter. Willem Jebbink vertegenwoordigt ons tegen een
gereduceerd tarief.</p>
<p>Wij hebben er vertrouwen in dat de zaak tegen ons
geseponeerd zal worden en de boetes kwijtgescholden. In de tussentijd hebben
wij echter wel wat geld nodig om ons te verdedigen tegen deze onterechte
arrestatie en boetes. Hiervoor hebben wij (ongeveer) 1280 euro nodig en vragen
daarom jullie (financiële) steun!</p>
<p>Elke donatie, klein en groot, wordt zeer gewaardeerd! </p>
<p>Wanneer wij, zoals wij verwachten, worden vrijgesproken
zullen ook de juridische kosten worden kwijtgescholden. Wij zullen er
natuurlijk voor zorgen dat het gedoneerde geld goed terecht komt bij de
vluchtelingen die wij welkom heten.</p>
<p>Naast jullie financiële steun hopen wij vooral dat jullie
ons willen steunen in actie; tegen racisme, voor feminisme en solidariteit met
vluchtelingen.</p>
<p>Op 6 februari om 13:00 bij de Dokwerker in Amsterdam
zullen wij er zijn om tegen de racistische organisatie PEGIDA te demonstreren
en hopen jullie daar in grote getalen te zien!</p>

we, 10 women of all ages, were arrested in Spijkenisse at the protest “Feminists

women to protect themselves against asylum seekers who, in Wilders words, are
“Islamic testosterone bombs”. </p>
<p>We peacefully spoke out
against Wilders’ cynical use of women’s rights to further his agenda of racism,
exclusion and fearmongering against
migrants, Muslims and refugees. The police infringed upon our right to free
speech, while Wilders’ supporters were allowed to hurl sexist abuse at us. We
refused to identify ourselves to the police because they had no grounds to
demand this, and had we complied with this demand it would have effectively
ended our protest. Because of this refusal we were detained and were held for
hours, and one women was even held overnight. We have been fined for not
complying with police orders and failure to identify ourselves (on the spot).</p>
<p>Our lawyer Willem Jebbink
considers both charges to be unfounded. We will contest the arrest and these
fines before a judge. Willem Jebbink is representing us at a reduced tariff. </p>

A tall shadow hovered up the stairs, slowly but steadily, searching its surroundings, weighing the possibilities, with so many doors in the corridor, unsure where to start from. ""Tender flesh makes me so eager, run away or be my dinner.""</p><p>Out of the pocket of black tailored pants appeared a long white hand, moving across the dusty banister, caressing it.  The creature kept ascending slowly up the stairs when suddenly a faint sound made it stop on its tracks.  It turned around quietly to check where the sound came from and reckoned it came from behind the first door to the right. ""If I do it fast enough, no one will notice…."" He hesitated.</p><p>He is on a mission. He has to get rid of the Interworld Border Gatekeeper, and he hasn't got a moment to waste, but the mesmerizing scent of something so fresh and energizing seeped through his nostrils to his veins and straight to his heart which was now beating wildly, tempting him mercilessly.</p><p>The sound was that of a crying maid which came to a sudden halt, no doubt silenced by fear. He imagined her warm and soft skin, waiting for him within such small distance. His stomach raged with hunger. It's been quite a while since he last afforded himself the taste of raw virginal flesh.  He became tense and immobile like a wild beast lurking in the dark, waiting to swoop on its prey. He turned his bald white head to the door and noticed a bundle of garlic cloves hanging from the lintel. A narrow crack began to widen in the center of the white face, from which glimpsed several rows of long sharp fangs. He thrusted his bony fingers into the lock and turned it open; then he kicked the door and heard a scream from inside the room.</p><p>The door broke off its hinges and hit the floor with a loud thud, releasing a thick cloud of dust. Overcome by feverish excitement, he charged into the room noticing a figure nimbly disappearing at the end of the corridor. Without thinking twice, he ran towards the end of the hall, breathing heavily, just in time to prevent the door from slamming in his face. <span>The young girl screamed again and managed to slide a few steps away from him, wailing and shaking with terror on the floor. She covered her face with her arms, looking like a helpless porcelain doll. </span></p><p>The creature had nothing on its mind apart from settling his stomach. He approached her and grabbed her arm forcefully. She was so thin he could squeeze her to death effortlessly. He propped her up with his long arm and pressed her back against the window, moving his face closer to hers.</p><p>Her eyes were still fixed upon the creature, wide open with horror. She could not control the tears that trickled down her trembling lips. He was very tall compared to her, wearing an austere dark gray suite which emphasized his slim and shockingly deformed body. His face looked like a white screen with neither/no eyes, nose or mouth. However, as he got closer to her, the girl could discern some faint facial features. The eye sockets seemed so deep and had no pupils. Where his mouth was supposed to be a thin crack appeared again, exposing his sharp fangs. </p><p>""My name……is Dmonrogue,"" said the creature slowly, ""and you are, most likely, one of these persecuted brats."" He let out a snarl and made for the main artery which bulged from the gir's neck. ""Please…."" She tearfully begged.</p><p>The creature indulged himself on the sweet scent that filled his nostrils. ""Please….what?"" He asked, prolonging the question. ""Please don't hurt me,"" sobbed the girl. A sickening and hungry smile spread across his face exposing all of his fangs; his foul breath made her hairs stand up. </p><p>""It is, no doubt, less enjoyable when the victim is unaware of the true reason which brings us to meet,"" he hissed. Then he stormed upon her in an animalistic amok. A terrible shriek sounded and escaped the window with the whistle of the cold wind. The whole street seemed to twist and twang with silent torturing. If someone had the courage to peek through the window or press an ear against the door, he could have easily imagined the expression on the poor girl's face a moment before she was gone.</p><br/>.מעבר לסויינג ברידג', רחוב ביראם,

A tall shadow hovered up the stairs, slowly but steadily, searching its surroundings, weighing the possibilities, with so many doors in the corridor, unsure where to start from. ""Tender flesh makes me so eager, run away or be my dinner.""Out of the pocket of black tailored pants appeared a long white hand, moving across the dusty banister, caressing it.  The creature kept ascending slowly up the stairs when suddenly a faint sound made it stop on its tracks.  It turned around quietly to check where the sound came from and reckoned it came from behind the first door to the right. ""If I do it fast enough, no one will notice…."" He hesitated.He is on a mission. He has to get rid of the Interworld Border Gatekeeper, and he hasn't got a moment to waste, but the mesmerizing scent of something so fresh and energizing seeped through his nostrils to his veins and straight to his heart which was now beating wildly, tempting him mercilessly.The sound was that of a crying maid which came to a sudden halt, no doubt silenced by fear. He imagined her warm and soft skin, waiting for him within such small distance. His stomach raged with hunger. It's been quite a while since he last afforded himself the taste of raw virginal flesh.  He became tense and immobile like a wild beast lurking in the dark, waiting to swoop on its prey. He turned his bald white head to the door and noticed a bundle of garlic cloves hanging from the lintel. A narrow crack began to widen in the center of the white face, from which glimpsed several rows of long sharp fangs. He thrusted his bony fingers into the lock and turned it open; then he kicked the door and heard a scream from inside the room.The door broke off its hinges and hit the floor with a loud thud, releasing a thick cloud of dust. Overcome by feverish excitement, he charged into the room noticing a figure nimbly disappearing at the end of the corridor. Without thinking twice, he ran towards the end of the hall, breathing heavily, just in time to prevent the door from slamming in his face. The young girl screamed again and managed to slide a few steps away from him, wailing and shaking with terror on the floor. She covered her face with her arms, looking like a helpless porcelain doll. The creature had nothing on its mind apart from settling his stomach. He approached her and grabbed her arm forcefully. She was so thin he could squeeze her to death effortlessly. He propped her up with his long arm and pressed her back against the window, moving his face closer to hers.Her eyes were still fixed upon the creature, wide open with horror. She could not control the tears that trickled down her trembling lips. He was very tall compared to her, wearing an austere dark gray suite which emphasized his slim and shockingly deformed body. His face looked like a white screen with neither/no eyes, nose or mouth. However, as he got closer to her, the girl could discern some faint facial features. The eye sockets seemed so deep and had no pupils. Where his mouth was supposed to be a thin crack appeared again, exposing his sharp fangs. ""My name……is Dmonrogue,"" said the creature slowly, ""and you are, most likely, one of these persecuted brats."" He let out a snarl and made for the main artery which bulged from the gir's neck. ""Please…."" She tearfully begged.The creature indulged himself on the sweet scent that filled his nostrils. ""Please….what?"" He asked, prolonging the question. ""Please don't hurt me,"" sobbed the girl. A sickening and hungry smile spread across his face exposing all of his fangs; his foul breath made her hairs stand up. ""It is, no doubt, less enjoyable when the victim is unaware of the true reason which brings us to meet,"" he hissed. Then he stormed upon her in an animalistic amok. A terrible shriek sounded and escaped the window with the whistle of the cold wind. The whole street seemed to twist and twang with silent torturing. If someone had the courage to peek through the window or press an ear against the door, he could have easily imagined the expression on the poor girl's face a moment before she was gone..מעבר לסויינג ברידג', רחוב ביראם,

This program holds free writing and performance workshops throughout the year which culminate in a giant show in April (National Poetry Month) in which the 18 students who have been attending the most workshops and participating as poets and leaders in their community will compete for a chance to make the six-person 2015 Dallas Youth Poets team.  A team of youth performance poets that will travel during the summer to Houston to the Texas Youth Poetry Slam State Championship, then to Albuquerque for the Regional Green Chile Youth Poetry Slam Championship, and then to Atlanta, Georgia for the Brave New Voices National Youth Poetry Slam and Literary Festival.  As you can imagine, taking six youth poets from the inner city around the country and lodging and feeding them is an expensive endeavor, but together we can make it happen.  I believe this experience can help young people realize that they can write the wrongs of the world and that their voices matter, with your contribution, you can help me accomplish this.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <ul> <li>$1500 Registration for Dallas Youth Poets to attend and compete at the Brave New Voices National Youth Poetry Slam (if we pay the early reduced rate in February) if we miss that deadline the registration goes up in cost</li>

<p><b>Who Am I?</b></p>
<p>I am a British
photographer and author documenting the surviving Western genre movie sets in
the American West. </p>
<p>My passion for the sets,
the movies made there and the people who share a history with these iconic backdrops
began during a trip to California in 2001. During that summer, I became
interested in the history of <i>the wild
frontier, </i>and in particular, Hollywood’s depiction of the West as myth, and
its influence on the lasting romance we have with the Western genre. </p>
<p><b>What Am I Doing?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2005, the
architecture of the movie sets caught my attention and I began photographing
them. Once I started photographing these sets, I became interested in the
histories behind each location. By 2012, it became apparent that my research
was leading to the book project. </p>
<p>The book project has evolved
from merely documenting the movie sets and their history to interviewing
the owners, caretakers, set designers, directors, actors, stuntmen, and countless
others who have come into contact with the sets.</p>
<p>The book chronicles
this important aspect of the history and heritage of the west. Many of these
western movie sets have already disappeared (2 whilst writing the book). The
remaining movie sets need to be documented, along with the people who share
their history. So far the book has many stories, and many more to tell. Time is of the essence, all the
stories need to be told while the older generation of preservationists are still here to tell them.<br/></p>
<p><b>What Am I looking to Fund?</b></p>
<p>Though printing of the
book will be at a future date, this campaign will help advance the content of
the book in a real and meaningful way, by helping me attend a once-in-a-lifetime

the 1985 novel with the same name by Larry McMurtry) was filmed on four of the
movie sets chronicled in my book, Alamo Village, Bonanza Creek Ranch, Cerro
Pelon and Eaves Movie Ranch. Attendance at this event will help me deepen the
scope and appeal of the book, while recording a major piece of Western movie
set history. </p>
<p>The Lonesome Dove cast
and crew will make special appearances, as well as attend panel discussions. This is my opportunity to gather personal, behind the scenes
stories from the making of Lonesome Dove. I am in the process of making contact
with cast and crew to set up interviews. One of my contacts is working to arrange
an interview with Robert Duvall! So far I have secured tickets to all 5 panel discussions, where Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones, Anjelica Huston, Diane Lane, Danny Glover, Ricky Schroder and Chris Cooper are due to attend, along with the directors, producers and art production team. Interviews have been arranged with Ricky Schroder (Newt Dobbs), Barry Corbin (Roscoe Brown), Director - Simon Wincer, Screen writer/Exec producer -  Bill Wittliff and Production Designer - Cary White, with more to follow...</p>

</div>","Who Am I?
I am a British
photographer and author documenting the surviving Western genre movie sets in
the American West. 
My passion for the sets,
the movies made there and the people who share a history with these iconic backdrops
began during a trip to California in 2001. During that summer, I became
interested in the history of the wild
frontier, and in particular, Hollywood’s depiction of the West as myth, and
its influence on the lasting romance we have with the Western genre. 
What Am I Doing?

In 2005, the
architecture of the movie sets caught my attention and I began photographing
them. Once I started photographing these sets, I became interested in the
histories behind each location. By 2012, it became apparent that my research
was leading to the book project. 
The book project has evolved
from merely documenting the movie sets and their history to interviewing
the owners, caretakers, set designers, directors, actors, stuntmen, and countless
others who have come into contact with the sets.
The book chronicles
this important aspect of the history and heritage of the west. Many of these
western movie sets have already disappeared (2 whilst writing the book). The
remaining movie sets need to be documented, along with the people who share
their history. So far the book has many stories, and many more to tell. Time is of the essence, all the
stories need to be told while the older generation of preservationists are still here to tell them.
What Am I looking to Fund?
Though printing of the
book will be at a future date, this campaign will help advance the content of
the book in a real and meaningful way, by helping me attend a once-in-a-lifetime
event: The Lonesome Dove Reunion and Trail in Fort Worth, Texas, on March 30
and 31, 2016.
The iconic 1989 TV Western
mini-series Lonesome Dove (based on
the 1985 novel with the same name by Larry McMurtry) was filmed on four of the
movie sets chronicled in my book, Alamo Village, Bonanza Creek Ranch, Cerro
Pelon and Eaves Movie Ranch. Attendance at this event will help me deepen the
scope and appeal of the book, while recording a major piece of Western movie
set history. 
The Lonesome Dove cast
and crew will make special appearances, as well as attend panel discussions. This is my opportunity to gather personal, behind the scenes

To date the trips from the UK to the USA  to make the book project happen have been self funded (apart from a few much appreciated 
donations), but I've reached the point where I need your pledges to make
the Lonesome Dove chapter a reality. The material gathered during this trip
will make the book a definite read for film historians and Western fans alike.How much is it going to cost?
The project will be
fully funded at £2,500. This will cover: 
Airfare/Travel

<p><strong>Well, so do we!</strong></p>
<p>We're Amanda Gannon and Paul Batteiger, a couple of writers, artists, and fans of genre fiction trying to support ourselves by providing the onanistic masses with entertaining and well-written tales of sex and violence.  Our work is plot-heavy, character-driven, and woman-friendly, which is how we say that we try to write stuff that would not piss us off to read.</p>
<p>Our latest project is <strong><em>Queen of the Sky Frontier</em></strong>, our 7<sup>th</sup> novel. It's a steampunky western erotic adventure serial full of sex, violence, pirates, airships, Experimentals, and maybe even some dinosaurs.   It will run on our site, <a href=""http://adventurotica.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Adventurotica: Full Frontal Fiction"">Adventurotica.com</a>, from February until June, allowing members to read it in bite-sized installments, and after that it will be an ebook and a print edition.  We need to stay afloat while it runs, though, and that is where you come in.</p>
<p><strong>We need to raise $3,000 to cover some of the cost of living over the four-month course of the novel. </strong> Neither of us is employed aside from this, and Amanda is in the unfortunate position of being functionally disabled due to bipolar depression without having yet been approved for disability.  We need food, we need to keep our home, and we need medical care that, frankly, we aren't getting.</p>
<p>This won't cover us completely, but it's a great start, and it's a goal we think we can make if we get help from people like you: people who support independent publishing and who care about enabling creative folks to support themselves doing what they love best.</p>
<p>In exchange, we're offering site memberships, print and ebook copies of the finished novel, and really neat stuff like walk-on roles and sexy bonus scenes tailored to fit your tastes. Your contribution will help us pay the bills and stay in our home and buy medication.  It will literally make us healthier and happier.  Further, we think it will make the genre of erotica a better and more fun place.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, read on!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT?</h2>
<p><em>Queen of the Sky Frontier</em> is the sequel to <em>Sky Pirates of the Rio Grande</em>, also a steampunk western.  It stands alone, so don't worry about jumping right in.  Plus, the first book comes with most levels of sponsorship, so you won't be too far behind!  If you're really hot to trot, you can check out the book on Smashwords, <a href=""https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/158912"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<h3>What's the story?</h3>
<p>Well, you can watch that trailer video up there, which ought to give you some idea (there's a transcript available on the YouTube page for the Deaf/HOH) or you can read this handy-dandy synopsis without having to click on anything!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">When Eden Kane defeated Captain Dire, she became ruler of the Brethren of the Sky. With enemies on both sides, she must hold the empire she has won from those who would take it from her. Captain Black's Renegades are massed behind Captain Dire's untested daughter, Azrael Dire. Captain Hood gathers his strength in the wild northlands, ready to seize power with his dreadnought airships. Even Eden's own followers, the pirate fleet of El Dorado, may turn on her at the slightest sign of weakness.  With nothing but courage and her Experimental brain, Eden must fight to be Queen of the Sky Frontier.</p>
<p>What kind of sex is in it?  We're glad you asked.  <em>Queen of the Sky Frontier</em> will be mostly het, but it will contain F/F content, and lots of threesomes.  Boys might kiss before the end, you never know. (Just so you know, we aren't opposed to any orientation or any gender, but Paul is pretty relentlessly straight, and he's writing this one. Amanda remains hopeful, and there's always the chance someone will pick M/M for the bonus scene. Hint, hint.)</p>
<p><strong>We do include some kinky stuff. </strong> That's not the main thrust of the book, but it's an element we tend to come back to over and over. Because, you know, <em>hot.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>OH MY GOD, WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?</h2>
<p>We're authors published across various genres.  Paul has had pirate fiction (of the non-erotica variety) published in the superb anthology <em>Fast Ships, Black Sails</em>, edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and published by Night Shade Books in 2008.  Amanda's stories have appeared in <em>The Mammoth Book of Best New Erotica</em> twice, in volumes 4 and 6, and both of them contributed stories to <em>Beauty Has Her Way</em>, a fantastic anthology of stories about strong, driven, dangerous women edited by Jennifer Brozek and published by Dark Quest Books in 2011.</p>
<p>Paul will be taking the authorial reins on this project. Amanda will be editing and constructing the artsy perks. She will also be handling some of the sex scenes and bonus scenes, and making sure the overall hotness level is up to par. She's also the kinky stuff fact-checker.</p>
<p>We live in Oklahoma, a poor state with very few resources for poor, mentally ill people with chronic health conditions, and who cannot work outside the home due to these limitations.  We're trying to do the best we can with what we have.  We just don't have much.</p>
<p>When you support us, you're helping us make the money we need to live.  It really is that simple.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHAT WE NEED</h2>
<p><strong>Money.</strong> (No point in beating around the bush.)</p>
<p>Here is how we will spend it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Materials for the incentives.</strong>  The hard copy books will cost around [X amount each] to print and ship.  Supplies and shipping to meet the anticipated demand for bookmarks will run around $150.  Optional licensing for new fonts (we'd really like some) and any necessary stock photos is around $70.</li>
<li>
<strong>Living expenses.</strong> Food, bills, and a roof to turn away the life-leeching rays of the blazing hatestar – sorry, <em>the sun</em>. We have this annoying hierarchy of needs thing going on. <em>Damn you, Maslow!</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medical care.</strong>  We have no insurance, and it isn't cheap to pay for medical care.  We won't burden you with details, but Amanda in particular cannot get some of the medication and treatment she needs through the low-cost clinic and pharmacy she currently attends.</li>
</ul><p>And there you have it. Most of it is going towards keeping us alive and healthy and relatively mentally stable. Is that exciting? No! But we have to stay alive to write smut. Contrary to what you might think, disease-ridden, lunatic zombies don't write very interesting sex scenes. It's just a lot of moaning and cannibalism.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<p><strong>A chance to get lucky!</strong>  Our biggest incentive package is the <strong>I Want A Pony Package</strong>.  One is available for an outright $500 donation, but <em>all</em> donors, every single one, will get a chance at the second.  Give us money, even if all you can afford is a dollar, and we'll put your name into a hat from which we will select the lucky recipient.  You could wind up with something really amazing.  See below for what you'll get.  Read right to the end!</p>
<p>(If you <em>don't</em> want to be entered, you can tell us and we'll exempt you.)</p>
<p><strong>Good karma!</strong>  For just $1 you can get the warm and fuzzy feeling of helping independent artists eke out a living pursuing their dream of providing quality adult entertainment to the teeming, hairy-palmed masses!  For $5, we'll even <em>thank you</em> under whatever name you choose!  <em>Fancy!</em>  And, folks, we really don't care if you can't give much.  Anything you can give will help.</p>
<p><strong>Gorgeous handmade bookmarks!</strong>  Dress up those eldritch tomes and books of ancient sexual secrets in something classy, like a black velvet ribbon bookmark with sparkly beads and a skull and crossbones charm!  That will definitely distract people from the alarming nature of what you are reading.  The default 11"" size will fit trade paperbacks, but if you get in touch with us right after you contribute, we can make yours anywhere from 9"" to 15"".</p>
<p>You can get the bookmark by itself.  This is a great option for those who wish to show their support, but don't want books full of shagging sent to their house.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/naamah_darling/8118580489"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here's one of the bookmarks for <em>The Golden Mask</em></a>, our last serial campaign – and the one that is currently running at Adventurotica. The bookmarks for <em>Queen of the Sky Frontier</em> will be quite similar.</p>
<p>If you contribute at the $75 level or above, Amanda will pick a ribbon color from what she has available, some beads, some charms, and surprise you with something totally unique.</p>
<p><strong>But wait! There's more! We also offer literary perks!</strong></p>
<p><strong>How about a gruesome literary death?</strong>  Want to die bravely fighting sky pirates?  Get shot in a brothel?  How about mauled by a pregnant tiger-woman?  Now <em>that's</em> unique.  Whatever your preferred end, we have you covered.</p>
<p><strong>Or you can have a sexy walk on role!</strong>  Bow chicka bow-ow!  We can make this happen.  Seriously.  We have a lot of hot pirate ladies and a lot of sexy scoundrels, and <em>somebody</em> needs to be hitting that, is what I'm saying.</p>
<p><strong>Or both.</strong>  You know.  Come before you go?</p>
<p><strong>How about a bonus scene? </strong>Frustrated by how your favorite characters never wind up getting it on? We have a perk for that. It doesn't even have to be canon, and we are extremely open-minded about content. We don't judge. Unless that's your thing. Once you've decided who you like best, just tell us what you like and don't like in your sex scenes, and we'll do the rest.</p>
<p>It'll go into the print book, even, but unless you ask us to – oooh, shameless! – we won't tell anyone who is responsible.</p>
<p><strong>Or.</strong></p>
<p>The ultimate perk.<em> The perk of all perks.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Your very own pony!</strong></em></p>
<h2><strong>The I Want A Pony Package.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Amanda will make you an Experimental Pirate Pony out of a real My Little Pony.</strong>  Tell her what colors you like, one to three, and the rest will be a mystery until it arrives at your door!</p>
<p>What does that have to do with the book?  Well, you could say it's pirates, but mostly, making ponies is just something that Amanda likes to do. She doesn't take commissions, so this is a rare chance.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/naamah_darling/sets/72157629141326052/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can see her ponies here.</a></p>
<p>Your pony will come with accessories.  <em>What</em> accessories will depend on what Amanda's bizarre imagination comes up with.  Treasure and a map, at the very least.  Probably a hat, too. <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/naamah_darling/sets/72157630307153024/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stolen Kisses, here,</a> has some appropriately snazzy accessories, and you can expect something similar.</p>

<h2>WHAT HAPPENS</h2>
<p>We post the book serially on our site. This will be our 7<sup>th</sup> novel, and we've never failed to post three serial updates a week. We are reliable. The story <em>will</em> be finished on time. It is projected to run between 50 and 60 chapters, and should be between 125,000 and 150,000 words.</p>
<ul>
<li>Memberships to Adventurotica will be available for use immediately, meaning you can follow along there, three times a week, until the story ends.</li>
<li>If you've bought yourself any sort of walk-on role or bonus scene, that will obviously come out <em>with</em> the ebook.</li>
<li>The ebook won't come out until after the book has been published in serial form on Adventurotica.com, which should wrap up in June. You'll be able to read it at Adventurotica the entire time.</li>
<li>Print books will be released at the same time as the ebook.</li>
<li>Bookmarks. Should take us about three weeks to gin those suckers up after the campaign ends, allowing for lag time in getting supplies shipped to us.  They'll be shipped separately when complete.</li>
<li>Your pony will take a month or two.  Amanda will stay in touch with you throughout.  If there's no donor, she'll start when the drawing is over and the campaign wraps.  If there is, she'll do the pony for the donor <em>first</em>, and the one for the lucky winner second.</li>
</ul><p>If we don't make goal, we'll still be able to provide the perks for everyone who did donate, and we'll do the best we can on what we get. And someone still gets a pony.</p>

<h2>THE IMPACT</h2>
<p>This is the part where we're supposed to explain how our project is valuable to you and to the world. No pressure. Look, we'd love to claim that our project will bring about world peace by making sure nobody has a hand free to pull a trigger, but that seems unlikely.</p>

<strong>What we can do is make people happy.</strong> Have a good time. Bring something that is unreservedly fun into the world, just because it belongs here.</li>

<strong>Erotica is an important genre, and we want to make it a better, more entertaining place.</strong> Bottom line, people often complain, with good reason, that good erotica is difficult to find. That most of it is poorly-written. That the characters are flat. That the sex is boring. That it doesn't tell an interesting story.  That it's horribly sexist and gross.  Well, all that is changing at lightning speed, and we want to be a part of that.  We've just found that we're happier working for ourselves than for other people, as much as we love those other people.</li>
<li>
<strong>We want to give readers </strong><em><strong>entertainment for adults</strong></em><strong>, not just adult entertainment.</strong> There is a dire shortage of well-written, fast-paced, plot-heavy long-form erotica. We want to write a book that provides you, the reader, with a well-told adventure story that doesn't fade to black just when things are getting good.</li>
<li>
<strong>We want to encourage independent erotica publishing by being part of it.</strong> By publishing independently, we are freeing ourselves from the restrictions placed on authors by publishers; restrictions on content, on length, on ratio of plot to sex.   We aren't breaking rules. We're stepping outside of them.</li>
<li>
<strong>We want to keep on keepin' on.</strong>  This is the important one to us. If you think about how much you enjoy eating, drinking, and being merry, as well as how nice it is if you have a home and access to basic medical care, it should need no explanation. It means<em> the world</em> to us.</li>

<h2>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h2>
<p><em><strong>Boost the signal!</strong> If you can't contribute, that's totally fine.  You can still tell everyone about us.</em></p>
<p>There are share tools right here on Indiegogo!  Also, we are assuming you have some social network stuff going on, so spreading the word that way would be super-awesome of you.</p>
<p>We're sure you have friends who would appreciate some steampunky swashbuckling pirate-y smut, so, really, you'll be doing them a <em>service</em> sending them our way.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate those who support us by helping to spread the word. Y'all do a lot of good, and we cannot thank you enough.</p></div>","WANT TO READ SOME STEAMPUNKY WESTERN PIRATE SMUT?
Well, so do we!
We're Amanda Gannon and Paul Batteiger, a couple of writers, artists, and fans of genre fiction trying to support ourselves by providing the onanistic masses with entertaining and well-written tales of sex and violence.  Our work is plot-heavy, character-driven, and woman-friendly, which is how we say that we try to write stuff that would not piss us off to read.
Our latest project is Queen of the Sky Frontier, our 7th novel. It's a steampunky western erotic adventure serial full of sex, violence, pirates, airships, Experimentals, and maybe even some dinosaurs.   It will run on our site, Adventurotica.com, from February until June, allowing members to read it in bite-sized installments, and after that it will be an ebook and a print edition.  We need to stay afloat while it runs, though, and that is where you come in.
We need to raise $3,000 to cover some of the cost of living over the four-month course of the novel.  Neither of us is employed aside from this, and Amanda is in the unfortunate position of being functionally disabled due to bipolar depression without having yet been approved for disability.  We need food, we need to keep our home, and we need medical care that, frankly, we aren't getting.
This won't cover us completely, but it's a great start, and it's a goal we think we can make if we get help from people like you: people who support independent publishing and who care about enabling creative folks to support themselves doing what they love best.
In exchange, we're offering site memberships, print and ebook copies of the finished novel, and really neat stuff like walk-on roles and sexy bonus scenes tailored to fit your tastes. Your contribution will help us pay the bills and stay in our home and buy medication.  It will literally make us healthier and happier.  Further, we think it will make the genre of erotica a better and more fun place.
If you want to learn more, read on!
 
WHAT IS THIS BOOK ABOUT?
Queen of the Sky Frontier is the sequel to Sky Pirates of the Rio Grande, also a steampunk western.  It stands alone, so don't worry about jumping right in.  Plus, the first book comes with most levels of sponsorship, so you won't be too far behind!  If you're really hot to trot, you can check out the book on Smashwords, here.
What's the story?
Well, you can watch that trailer video up there, which ought to give you some idea (there's a transcript available on the YouTube page for the Deaf/HOH) or you can read this handy-dandy synopsis without having to click on anything!
When Eden Kane defeated Captain Dire, she became ruler of the Brethren of the Sky. With enemies on both sides, she must hold the empire she has won from those who would take it from her. Captain Black's Renegades are massed behind Captain Dire's untested daughter, Azrael Dire. Captain Hood gathers his strength in the wild northlands, ready to seize power with his dreadnought airships. Even Eden's own followers, the pirate fleet of El Dorado, may turn on her at the slightest sign of weakness.  With nothing but courage and her Experimental brain, Eden must fight to be Queen of the Sky Frontier.
What kind of sex is in it?  We're glad you asked.  Queen of the Sky Frontier will be mostly het, but it will contain F/F content, and lots of threesomes.  Boys might kiss before the end, you never know. (Just so you know, we aren't opposed to any orientation or any gender, but Paul is pretty relentlessly straight, and he's writing this one. Amanda remains hopeful, and there's always the chance someone will pick M/M for the bonus scene. Hint, hint.)
We do include some kinky stuff.  That's not the main thrust of the book, but it's an element we tend to come back to over and over. Because, you know, hot.
 
OH MY GOD, WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?
We're authors published across various genres.  Paul has had pirate fiction (of the non-erotica variety) published in the superb anthology Fast Ships, Black Sails, edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and published by Night Shade Books in 2008.  Amanda's stories have appeared in The Mammoth Book of Best New Erotica twice, in volumes 4 and 6, and both of them contributed stories to Beauty Has Her Way, a fantastic anthology of stories about strong, driven, dangerous women edited by Jennifer Brozek and published by Dark Quest Books in 2011.
Paul will be taking the authorial reins on this project. Amanda will be editing and constructing the artsy perks. She will also be handling some of the sex scenes and bonus scenes, and making sure the overall hotness level is up to par. She's also the kinky stuff fact-checker.
We live in Oklahoma, a poor state with very few resources for poor, mentally ill people with chronic health conditions, and who cannot work outside the home due to these limitations.  We're trying to do the best we can with what we have.  We just don't have much.
When you support us, you're helping us make the money we need to live.  It really is that simple.
 
WHAT WE NEED
Money. (No point in beating around the bush.)
Here is how we will spend it:


Materials for the incentives.  The hard copy books will cost around [X amount each] to print and ship.  Supplies and shipping to meet the anticipated demand for bookmarks will run around $150.  Optional licensing for new fonts (we'd really like some) and any necessary stock photos is around $70.

Living expenses. Food, bills, and a roof to turn away the life-leeching rays of the blazing hatestar – sorry, the sun. We have this annoying hierarchy of needs thing going on. Damn you, Maslow!


Medical care.  We have no insurance, and it isn't cheap to pay for medical care.  We won't burden you with details, but Amanda in particular cannot get some of the medication and treatment she needs through the low-cost clinic and pharmacy she currently attends.
And there you have it. Most of it is going towards keeping us alive and healthy and relatively mentally stable. Is that exciting? No! But we have to stay alive to write smut. Contrary to what you might think, disease-ridden, lunatic zombies don't write very interesting sex scenes. It's just a lot of moaning and cannibalism.
 
WHAT YOU GET
A chance to get lucky!  Our biggest incentive package is the I Want A Pony Package.  One is available for an outright $500 donation, but all donors, every single one, will get a chance at the second.  Give us money, even if all you can afford is a dollar, and we'll put your name into a hat from which we will select the lucky recipient.  You could wind up with something really amazing.  See below for what you'll get.  Read right to the end!
(If you don't want to be entered, you can tell us and we'll exempt you.)
Good karma!  For just $1 you can get the warm and fuzzy feeling of helping independent artists eke out a living pursuing their dream of providing quality adult entertainment to the teeming, hairy-palmed masses!  For $5, we'll even thank you under whatever name you choose!  Fancy!  And, folks, we really don't care if you can't give much.  Anything you can give will help.
Gorgeous handmade bookmarks!  Dress up those eldritch tomes and books of ancient sexual secrets in something classy, like a black velvet ribbon bookmark with sparkly beads and a skull and crossbones charm!  That will definitely distract people from the alarming nature of what you are reading.  The default 11"" size will fit trade paperbacks, but if you get in touch with us right after you contribute, we can make yours anywhere from 9"" to 15"".
You can get the bookmark by itself.  This is a great option for those who wish to show their support, but don't want books full of shagging sent to their house.
Here's one of the bookmarks for The Golden Mask, our last serial campaign – and the one that is currently running at Adventurotica. The bookmarks for Queen of the Sky Frontier will be quite similar.
If you contribute at the $75 level or above, Amanda will pick a ribbon color from what she has available, some beads, some charms, and surprise you with something totally unique.
But wait! There's more! We also offer literary perks!
How about a gruesome literary death?  Want to die bravely fighting sky pirates?  Get shot in a brothel?  How about mauled by a pregnant tiger-woman?  Now that's unique.  Whatever your preferred end, we have you covered.
Or you can have a sexy walk on role!  Bow chicka bow-ow!  We can make this happen.  Seriously.  We have a lot of hot pirate ladies and a lot of sexy scoundrels, and somebody needs to be hitting that, is what I'm saying.
Or both.  You know.  Come before you go?
How about a bonus scene? Frustrated by how your favorite characters never wind up getting it on? We have a perk for that. It doesn't even have to be canon, and we are extremely open-minded about content. We don't judge. Unless that's your thing. Once you've decided who you like best, just tell us what you like and don't like in your sex scenes, and we'll do the rest.
It'll go into the print book, even, but unless you ask us to – oooh, shameless! – we won't tell anyone who is responsible.
Or.
The ultimate perk. The perk of all perks.
Your very own pony!
The I Want A Pony Package.
Amanda will make you an Experimental Pirate Pony out of a real My Little Pony.  Tell her what colors you like, one to three, and the rest will be a mystery until it arrives at your door!
What does that have to do with the book?  Well, you could say it's pirates, but mostly, making ponies is just something that Amanda likes to do. She doesn't take commissions, so this is a rare chance.
You can see her ponies here.
Your pony will come with accessories.  What accessories will depend on what Amanda's bizarre imagination comes up with.  Treasure and a map, at the very least.  Probably a hat, too. Stolen Kisses, here, has some appropriately snazzy accessories, and you can expect something similar.
If you are brave, you can ask that your pony and accessories be made NSFW.  Do you want a full suite of pony-sized BDSM toys?  Do you want your pony to have a cute little strap-on harness? We can build it.  We have the technology. Don't believe us? Have a link.  Click at your own risk; contains pony sex toys. Pink ones. Don't say we didn't warn you.
Your pony will come with a name and a background story so you can get to know your fancy new friend.  It will be very, very beautiful.  It won't be a pony made of diamonds, but it will belong to you.  You will be able to point to it and say to your friends, ""Not yours.""
Yes, we are asking for a generous donation for the pony.  These little gals can go for up to $200 or more if they're fully accessorized, and you'll be getting every other perk on the list, so we think it's a good deal, and still very, very generous of you.
And one randomly-selected donor will get all of this.  As we said above, everyone who donates will get a chance at winning the second I Want A Pony package.  Sex, violence, pony and all.  Because there's a chance nobody will go for the $500 donation, and Amanda still wants to make a steampunk pirate pony, dammit!
One dollar.
Pony sex toys.
Your odds are pretty good.

Think about them for a moment :)If you wanna skip all this, you can go directly to my publisher's site and purchase a book at http://www.readcwbooks.com/shattuck.html
Feel free to check out my website for some sample poems at http://davidshattuck.wordpress.com
Thanks for taking the time to read this, please pass along to any bibliophiles, poets, casual writers, and anyone who loves the written word!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

I've been a Pastor for 5 years and a preacher for 25 years.  With that said, I think the most important thing I could write about would be the Bible.  My style of teaching is based on making the complicated simple to understand.   The most important and impactful book ever printed is the Holy Bible.  Therefore, I have the goal to write many easy to follow and understand commentaries (a verse by verse explanation of the Word of God) about the different New Testament books of the Bible.  I have the book of Galatians completed and half of the book of Ephesians done.  My problem is I don't have the funds to print the book.

<li>  My name is Saul Rip Hansen, and I am a writer and an artist. I started this project with my best friend Lewis N. Clark (his parents were history teachers). Lewis and I started this story when I was eight years old, in 1993. The main inspiration for the lore and background in the story is taken from four sources: Native American culture, Greek mythology, Middle-eastern culture, and comic books. We decided to make the main characters gargoyles simply because no one had taken ownership of them yet. As we grew older we expanded the story, though from the very beginning, many of the concepts that Lewis came up in the first few years are the most powerful and have formed the foundation of the story. As a result of life choices, Lewis began to decline in ways while I was in high school. We kept in close contact during this time, but ultimately Lewis sank into a deep depression and took his own life in February 2003. This was a devastating event for me, and it took me years to restructure my life and learn how to cope with his loss. After I graduated high school in 2004, I took to writing full time, and decided to finish this story we had started as children. I wrote non-stop for seven months, averaging between 8-16 pages a day. The story flowed, and through it, and the vibrant characters inside it, I wrestled with Lewis' loss and incorporated all of the struggles and life lessons that I happened upon along the way. The experience of writing this story was a journey, and a healing one for me. I put so much of my heart into it that I realized I would never be able to walk away from it. Lewis and I have invested too much into it to do that. Lewis was the reason I started this story, and if it wasn't for Lewis, I never would have finished it.</li>
<li>Now I want to share it with you. It is a powerful story, one of the best compliments I have received from an Editor is that ""There are moments of Genius in the writing"". There are, they are beautiful, and every single one of those particular moments were inspired in some way. Never was there a moment of writer's block, never was there a part that did not come easily--this story flowed through my fingertips, and I feel it is so because it was meant to be. It is a remarkable story. Lewis was a genius, and I did my best to do his concepts justice with my writing. I am so grateful to finally be able to share this story with you, as well as the opportunity to help it become well known.</li>
<li>The purpose of this campaign is to raise $4,500 to make all three parts of The Rise of Shendoa available as soon as possible, and to generate awareness for the story--people need to know that this story exists and how good it is! </li>
<li>If you help this project reach its goal, then you can help this story 
meet its full potential by being able to eventually reach the masses. 
This isn't just one book, or even three books, it is an entire world, 
and series of books! You can help this story rise from the underground, 
you can help it go somewhere!<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>I want to paint you a quick picture of Vision: As this story catches on and moves into the mainstream, I will be enabled to take to writing the rest of the series full time, and make the entire story available to you and all the readers interested in this type of material. As this story rises, I will use whatever level of influence I have to contribute to the causes of sustainable residential architecture--which is my other passion. The entire goal of this project is to enable as many people as possible to be better situated to make a difference for good in the world. This story is my vehicle for making that possible. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>We need $4,500 to launch this series. This will enable us to make Part II and Part III of The Rise of Shendoa available in three to four months. It will also enable us to get the word out about this amazing story!</li>
<li>In return, those of you who support this project will have the option of receiving signed prints of art, original pieces of art, original handwritten pages, and all three books in The Rise of Shendoa trilogy--AND the awesome feeling that you were a part of something incredible from the very start!</li>
<li>If we don't reach the entire goal, the funds will go towards making Part II and Part III of The Rise of Shendoa available as soon as possible, and marketing efforts will be what gets cut back. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The ultimate long range goal of this project is to make the world a better place.</p><ul>
<li>This project is literally my life's work, and it is a product of the effort, collaboration, and support, of dozens of individuals that have believed in it from the beginning. The reason why I really want to make this entire story available is because it is filled with excellent examples of people being brave, being honest, and doing what is right even when circumstances are very difficult. The way that I do this is very unique, but the reason it is important is that the more material like this that people are exposed to, the more likely they are to emulate it in some way, even though the ideas come from a world of fantasy. Making a big splash with these first three books will enable me to make the rest of the story available sooner. With your help this series can be immensely successful. Apart from writing, my other passion is architecture and sustainability, and all of my efforts and influence as a writer will go into revolutionizing the residential housing market by combining existing technology in creative ways, and developing new technology and ideas to make home ownership a realistic goal for more Americans, without becoming slaves to debt.<br/>
</li>
<li>If this project makes more than the goal of $4,500 then one of the first stretch goals that we will reach for is making an audiobook version of the story available. We already have a narrator selected, and of course, for all the backers who made this option possible, they would receive the reward of the audio version.</li>
<li>Another stretch goal is making interactive ebooks with scenes from the book that are animated that are embedded in the text of the ebook, so that it will be a fully illustrated novel with animated scenes from key parts in the book.

<li>We have an incredible network of friends and contacts that we have built up over the last ten years trying to get this story out to you--but the best marketing strategy is word of mouth!

</li>
<li>Gas for two cars to drive to Oakland and back<br/>

<p>This City has been the world's greatest experiment in multiculturalism for centuries, drawing ambitious people with dreams and talent from across the country and the world to its five boroughs.

<div><h3>Wait- who and what is Janos?</h3></div> <p>I'm Janos, a born and raised New Yorker. I've spent the last thirteen years working as an activist, organizer, and political operative, and spent the last five years as an attorney.  Highlights include:</p>
<p>1) Serving as a special counsel to the Moreland Commission to Investigate Public Corruption, where I investigated the flow of money in New York politics. I've also written extensively about the role of money in politics since Citizens United. </p>
<p>2) Working as a civil rights lawyer, including a case that expanded the rights to protest in New York City. </p>
<p>3) Helping run the largest secular disaster response operation in Mississippi in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. </p>
<p>But I've never needed a formal job title to get things done. Among the things I've done as side projects:</p>

<li>Психологические проблемы адаптации пост-советских женщин в Англии.</li>
<li>""Незнакомки Лондона"" - уличный фотопроект Сергея Лекомцева. </li>
<li>Зачем женщинам делать health check, и чем принципиально отличается NHS от российской медицины.</li>
<li>История про Лидию Жибуртович - одну из самых ярких русских эмигранток в Лондоне, психиатром, близко дружившей с Оруэллом и Капицей.<span><br/></span>

Но в первом выпуске без вашей помощи не обойтись!<br/><span><br/></span>На печать журнала, а также дизайн, верстку, распространение и запуск нам нужно <b>£4500</b>. Все, что соберется сверх этого, отправится в фонд второго номера Russian Gap, посвященного английскому образованию.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>До конца года выйдут четыре номера журнала, на которые можно будет подписаться или найти в свободном доступе (мы дадим все адреса распространения).</span></span></span></p>

<h3>Как это будет выглядеть?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Некоторые технические параметры журнала Russian Gap:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Периодичность: раз в три месяца (четыре раза в год)</li>
<li>Выход первого номера - 12 марта 2015 </li>
<li>Объем: 80-100 полос</li>
<li>Формат: А4</li>
<li>Бумага: глянцевая</li>
<li>Распространение: по подписке, а также бесплатно во многих ""русских"" местах Лондона и ""лондонских"" местах России, плюс, на культурных и социальных мероприятиях</li>
<li>Тираж: 4000 экз. <span><br/></span>
</li>
</ul>Над дизайном журнала работает Полина Хохонова, выпускница архитектурной академии в Екатеринбурге, студентка Chelsea College of Art and Design, профессиональный дизайнер. Вот первые наброски того, как это может выглядеть. Хотя, возможно, все еще поменяется! <span><br/></span><p></p>

 В июле 2014 года мы запустили сайт russiangap.com, где стали писать про замечательных людей, живущих в Англии, и про то, что их окружает.
Уже к осени посещаемость сайта достигла 15-20 тысяч уникальных пользователей в месяц. Большинство из них - русскоязычные жители Лондона и ЮК, но также нас активно читают и в других странах. 



Все потому, что мы действительно пишем интересные вещи. Берем интервью у самых ярких русскоязычных британцев. Готовим уникальные репортажи. Пишем про искусство, образование, моду, необычные стартапы, а также про детей, психологию, историю, личный опыт.

...и куда нам надо?
Задача нового журнала - предоставить еще более удобную и эффективную площадку для всех, кому есть что сказать. 
Журнал не отменяет наличия сайта. Это проекты, которые будут существовать бок о бок. Печатный  Russian Gap будет выходить 4 раза в год и распространяться в самых интересных местах Лондона, а также отправляться в Россию и другие страны.
С помощью печатной версии мы хотим привлечь аудиторию, которая не сидит в фейсбуке (есть и такие!), но для которой тоже важно все, что здесь происходит. Также это прекрасная возможность готовить спецпроекты, приглашать к проекту Russian Gap талантливых людей и настоящих звезд своего дела. 

В каждом номере журнала мы будем делать фокус на какой-то теме и эту тему освещать с разных сторон. Первый выпуск будет посвящен... женщинам! Тому, как наши соотечественницы адаптируются к Англии (и покоряют ее!). 


У нас не будет традиционных для ""женских журналов"" статей, типа ""как понравиться мужчине"", ""как похудеть"" и прочее (сколько уж можно!) Как мы сами для себя определили, первый номер Russian Gap будет ""журналом о женщинах, который выпускают женщины, но который будут читать мужчины"".В числе материалов первого номера:



Самые интересные стартапы в Англии, запущенные девушками.
Как поется в Royal Opera House (интервью с молодой оперной звездой Лондона Надеждой Карязиной).
""Неженские"" специальности: от инженера-нефтяника до профессиональной доминатрикс.
Психологические проблемы адаптации пост-советских женщин в Англии.
""Незнакомки Лондона"" - уличный фотопроект Сергея Лекомцева. 
Зачем женщинам делать health check, и чем принципиально отличается NHS от российской медицины.
История про Лидию Жибуртович - одну из самых ярких русских эмигранток в Лондоне, психиатром, близко дружившей с Оруэллом и Капицей.

Много чего еще, включая светскую хронику, анонсы, рецензии, полезные адреса.


Как нам можно помочь?

 Мы всегда рады новым авторам и открыты любому сотрудничеству. Но чтобы выпустить журнал, нам  нужны деньги.Начиная со второго номера мы будем выпускаться за счет рекламы, и наших любимых читателей финансовыми вопросами беспокоить не станем. Но в первом выпуске без вашей помощи не обойтись!На печать журнала, а также дизайн, верстку, распространение и запуск нам нужно £4500. Все, что соберется сверх этого, отправится в фонд второго номера Russian Gap, посвященного английскому образованию.До конца года выйдут четыре номера журнала, на которые можно будет подписаться или найти в свободном доступе (мы дадим все адреса распространения).

Как это будет выглядеть?

<p><b>Meet Bungee and Ben.  Bungee is Ben's best friend, constant companion, and a bit of a handful.  This little monkey can get downright squirrelly at bedtime, coming out of his den, wanting to stay up until all hours, and generally making a nuisance of himself while Ben tries to sleep.  Ben knows they can't go on this way, with no energy to play their favorite games or have fun at the park. Even their favorite food tastes gray and lifeless. What can Ben do to save them both from tired, grouchy days?  With some trial and error and a little outside help, Ben might just find a way...</b></p>
<p><b>By reading our imaginative and fun picture storybook, young children and their parents will learn how Ben saves the day by rescuing the night for his furry best friend, himself, and his whole family. In the process, they'll start learning how to solve their own sleep issues.</b></p>

<h3><b><b><b>WHO WE ARE</b></b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our dynamic duo includes a <b>pediatric sleep expert and published author</b> (Sasha) and a <b>professional children's illustrator</b> (Linda). We share a passion for helping children and families be at their best while having fun along the way. Our mission is serious, but our method is all about imagination and play. </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b></b></b></p>
<h3><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><br/></b></b></h3>
<h3><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>WHY WE'RE DOING IT</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>(From Sasha) As a pediatric sleep consultant, I've seen firsthand how much sleep impacts every aspect of children's lives. <b>Sleep problems in young children can affect everything from learning and memory, to social skills, to physical health</b>. We now know that in a high proportion of children formerly diagnosed with ADHD, the real culprit turned out to be lack of quality sleep!</p>
<p>I've helped over a thousand families get on the path to better sleep and have seen firsthand the profound and lasting changes that can happen. <b>When young children ""get"" a concept, they embrace it with their full heart and soul</b>. When they feel empowered to create positive change, they are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p><b>A key part of my strategy for working with preschoolers is explaining that their favorite doll or stuffed animal is having sleep trouble.</b> We learn about how and why poor sleep is making life truly difficult for their cherished friend and we work together to make things better. The child's growing sense of caring for others is ignited while she gets to experience the power and purpose of having responsibility for another. This is heady stuff for a little one!</p>
<p>Time and again I've seen my little teammates transform from sleep troublemakers to mini sleep experts.  <b>Unfortunately there's just one of me and only so many families I can help personally</b>. What's more, not all families can afford the investment needed to work directly with a child sleep expert. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>But what if thousands of children could become mini sleep experts by learning how to solve sleep problems through the right story</b>?</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">WHY A STORYBOOK?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We all have treasured childhood stories that impact the way we understand the world. Instead of making yet another advice book for parents on how to improve their child's sleep, we want to harness the abundant energy and imagination of preschoolers so that they can make positive changes for themselves and their families.</span></div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And what better way to harness that amazing kid power than through a good story inspired by Sasha's work with preschoolers?  What if preschoolers and their parents could get on the same page, literally, at bedtime by rooting together, for the hero in our story?</span></div>
<div>
<p><i>Putting Bungee to Bed  </i>is a classic tale of friendship and overcoming obstacles which teaches young readers how to solve problems by getting everyone on the same team.</p>
<p>To make an even bigger impact, we're creating a special companion guide for parents, available for download to anyone who purchases the book. Parents can use the companion guide to help reinforce what their child learns from the story, but the book itself will help create change whether or not parents use the guide.</p>

<h3><b>WHY WE NEED YOU</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A truly appealing storybook which children want to read at bedtime needs to have excellent illustration and design. The look and feel of the book are at least as important as the story.</p>
<p>Using richly detailed illustrations, the book will SHOW as much as TELL the story of Ben and Bungee's journey from sleep fail to sleep win, highlighting the special bond of friendship they share. Linda has invested considerable time creating the two main characters shown here. She'll need to dedicate many more hours to bring our story fully to life.</p>
<p>We'll also need the help of professional art direction, layout and packaging, in addition to the usual costs of printing, distribution and shipping to create a finished product worthy of multiple bedtime readings.<br/></p>
<p>Finally, since the story is meant to teach young children how to learn through leading, we simply must offer kids the chance to have their own little plush Bungee to care for and put to bed!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Breakdown of budget</b></p>
<ul>
<li>40 full-color illustrations</li>
<li>Art direction and layout design</li>
<li>Cover design</li>
<li>Printing<br/>
</li>
<li>Plush prototype design and production</li>
<li>Plush child safety and product quality testing and certification</li>
<li>Plush production and delivery</li>
<li>Creation and online hosting of companion guide for parents</li>
<li>Book and plush distribution</li>
<li>Shipping</li>
<li>Indiegogo, credit card and Paypal fees</li>
</ul>
<div>In order to fully realize the book and accompanying plush as we envision them, we need to raise $25,000. We've dedicated many hours and our own funds to get this far, and we're 100 percent determined to take this project to the finish line. </div>

THE STORY
Meet Bungee and Ben.  Bungee is Ben's best friend, constant companion, and a bit of a handful.  This little monkey can get downright squirrelly at bedtime, coming out of his den, wanting to stay up until all hours, and generally making a nuisance of himself while Ben tries to sleep.  Ben knows they can't go on this way, with no energy to play their favorite games or have fun at the park. Even their favorite food tastes gray and lifeless. What can Ben do to save them both from tired, grouchy days?  With some trial and error and a little outside help, Ben might just find a way...
By reading our imaginative and fun picture storybook, young children and their parents will learn how Ben saves the day by rescuing the night for his furry best friend, himself, and his whole family. In the process, they'll start learning how to solve their own sleep issues.




3 GREAT REASONS TO SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN




You'll help us raise a new generation of mini sleep experts through storytelling. When we engage young children's imagination and empower them with the tools they need to understand WHY sleep is important and HOW to achieve a restful night, they become the most energetic champions of healthy sleep you can imagine.


You'll allow us to produce (illustrate, edit, design, package & print) every part of Putting Bungee to Bed  (plus a companion plush Bungee).





You'll enjoy some great perks including copies of the book, a huggable Bungee plush, and the chance to have your child featured in the book.

HOW IT WORKS
You can contribute to our campaign using one of the options to the right of your screen.

For a contribution of $25, we'll send you a 1st edition copy of Putting Bungee to Bed once it's printed, OR for a little more you can get a copy of the book PLUS a plush Bungee for your child to tuck in at bedtime. You can help out a school or nonprofit, get expert sleep guidance, hang some one-of-a-kind artwork on the wall, and put your name in print forever. Your child could even be featured as a character in the book!
And if nothing special catches your eye but you still want to support our cause, you can donate any amount you choose to the campaign.


WHO WE ARE

Our dynamic duo includes a pediatric sleep expert and published author (Sasha) and a professional children's illustrator (Linda). We share a passion for helping children and families be at their best while having fun along the way. Our mission is serious, but our method is all about imagination and play. 


WHY WE'RE DOING IT

(From Sasha) As a pediatric sleep consultant, I've seen firsthand how much sleep impacts every aspect of children's lives. Sleep problems in young children can affect everything from learning and memory, to social skills, to physical health. We now know that in a high proportion of children formerly diagnosed with ADHD, the real culprit turned out to be lack of quality sleep!
I've helped over a thousand families get on the path to better sleep and have seen firsthand the profound and lasting changes that can happen. When young children ""get"" a concept, they embrace it with their full heart and soul. When they feel empowered to create positive change, they are a force to be reckoned with.
A key part of my strategy for working with preschoolers is explaining that their favorite doll or stuffed animal is having sleep trouble. We learn about how and why poor sleep is making life truly difficult for their cherished friend and we work together to make things better. The child's growing sense of caring for others is ignited while she gets to experience the power and purpose of having responsibility for another. This is heady stuff for a little one!
Time and again I've seen my little teammates transform from sleep troublemakers to mini sleep experts.  Unfortunately there's just one of me and only so many families I can help personally. What's more, not all families can afford the investment needed to work directly with a child sleep expert. But what if thousands of children could become mini sleep experts by learning how to solve sleep problems through the right story?



WHY A STORYBOOK?


We all have treasured childhood stories that impact the way we understand the world. Instead of making yet another advice book for parents on how to improve their child's sleep, we want to harness the abundant energy and imagination of preschoolers so that they can make positive changes for themselves and their families.
And what better way to harness that amazing kid power than through a good story inspired by Sasha's work with preschoolers?  What if preschoolers and their parents could get on the same page, literally, at bedtime by rooting together, for the hero in our story?

Putting Bungee to Bed  is a classic tale of friendship and overcoming obstacles which teaches young readers how to solve problems by getting everyone on the same team.
To make an even bigger impact, we're creating a special companion guide for parents, available for download to anyone who purchases the book. Parents can use the companion guide to help reinforce what their child learns from the story, but the book itself will help create change whether or not parents use the guide.

WHY WE NEED YOU


A truly appealing storybook which children want to read at bedtime needs to have excellent illustration and design. The look and feel of the book are at least as important as the story.
Using richly detailed illustrations, the book will SHOW as much as TELL the story of Ben and Bungee's journey from sleep fail to sleep win, highlighting the special bond of friendship they share. Linda has invested considerable time creating the two main characters shown here. She'll need to dedicate many more hours to bring our story fully to life.
We'll also need the help of professional art direction, layout and packaging, in addition to the usual costs of printing, distribution and shipping to create a finished product worthy of multiple bedtime readings.
Finally, since the story is meant to teach young children how to learn through leading, we simply must offer kids the chance to have their own little plush Bungee to care for and put to bed!

Breakdown of budget

40 full-color illustrations
Art direction and layout design
Cover design
Printing

Plush prototype design and production
Plush child safety and product quality testing and certification
Plush production and delivery
Creation and online hosting of companion guide for parents
Book and plush distribution
Shipping
Indiegogo, credit card and Paypal fees

In order to fully realize the book and accompanying plush as we envision them, we need to raise $25,000. We've dedicated many hours and our own funds to get this far, and we're 100 percent determined to take this project to the finish line.

</p><p><b>The DTRIS File</b></p>
<p><b><i>What’s really going on out there? Who
are those guys anyway? It’s time to tell the truth. </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>The
DTRIS File</i> is the next big science fiction adventure series set in the very
near future. In Book 1, <i>The DTRIS File, Timelines,
</i>the story transcends actual historical events. The characters are caught in
a web of complex mortal and unworldly wars. If you are a fan of Star Wars and
other science fiction and fantasy stories you'll love <i>The DTRIS File</i>.
Like great authors such as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, <i>The DTRIS File</i>
takes elements of true Biblical beliefs and marries them with tenets of modern
scientific theory in a way that has never been done before. </p>
<p><b><i>Who will like this book?</i></b></p>
<p><i>The
DTRIS File</i> should appeal to most anyone but especially for those who are
intimate with Science, Military, or Biblical tenets as well as those interested
in the concepts of Weather Warfare, ELF Waves and Galactic Transfer Portals. As
easy to read as a 1960 newspaper, <i>The DTRIS File</i> covers the Sci-Fi,
Mystery and Adventure genres. The characters are well thought out and have
purpose. There are multiple alien cultures, strange creatures, good bad guys
and even a love story. <i>The DTRIS File</i> does not indulge in sex scenes or
foul language and will not entertain those looking for worthless content. It is
a book for those with intellect, who want a serious narrative. The complex
story plot contains twists and turns with a good helping of wit.</p>
<p><i>The DTRIS File</i> is planned to be a
trilogy. Book One, <i>Timelines</i>, is complete. Book Two, <i>Space Pirates</i>, is 60%
complete. Book Three is undergoing research and will be completed after the
successful publishing of the first two books. The search for art is underway. Any funds raised over the $2000 goal will
be used toward the successful completion of the second and third books.</p>
<p><b><i>Who is the author?</i></b></p>
<p>My name is Darrel Dillon I have been an avid reader since
childhood, a fan of authors such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, Michael Crichton,
Clive Cussler and Frank Herbert. I grew up in Syracuse, New York in the 50’s
and 60’s. I learned how to play the drums in my teens and played in a band
called “The Sharks” in the mid sixties.  </p>
<p>I joined the Navy in 1966 and served 10 years of active duty
on three Destroyers with four, six month tours of duty in the South China Sea
during the Viet Nam war. I left the Navy as a GMT1 with two good conduct
awards. My primary duty was as an ASROC technician or, for civilians, an
antisubmarine rocket weapons system specialist. I’ve actually been on the bridge
of a Navy Warship during war. I’ve actually used a rocket launcher control
panel to fire real rockets. I’ve spent many hours looking for bogeys and
skunks. I’ve monitored radar and sonar scopes. I’ve actually observed a meteor
fly over the ship in the dark night sky and watched shrapnel rain down on my
ship in front of my eye. So I know “whereof I speak”. </p>
<p>I currently live in Bellingham, Washington where I own and
operate a computer repair and virus removal business, <i>The Virus Busters</i>.
Besides writing, drumming and computer repair, I enjoy doing genealogical
research in my spare time.</p>
<p><b><i>Why Indiegogo?</i></b></p>
<p>In the current market of book publishing, it is extremely
rare to get a book by a new author added to the roles of a publisher. Most
authors must first self-publish and generate publicity. With that in mind, I
need funding for the cost of self publishing and backer reward expenses. The
illustration art work has yet to be started, volunteers are welcome.</p>
<p>I will forever be grateful for divine inspiration and to
anyone who chooses to help.</p>

<h1>About Randy</h1>
<h1>(Who am I &amp; Why Did I Write this Book?)</h1>
<p>     I grew up not far from Disneyland. And I grew up in the church. I went to Bible College, and I was a pastor (and still preach as the opportunity arises). But so what? Lots of people could say the same thing. <b>What makes me different? I'm glad you asked.</b></p>
<p>     My family was usually ill when I was growing up. My Grandma lived with us for the last several years of her life, and I helped my parents take care of her. My Mom was sick several times as well, and I helped take care of her, too. <b>I even quit my first job in part to be home so she could have major surgery without worrying about who was going to take care of Grandma (her mother). </b>I was always a “little adult,” and had to grow up very fast and mature a lot faster than one would typically expect of a child, perhaps partially because I am an only child. A lot was expected of me. <b>“With great power comes great responsibility.” I had the responsibility part, anyway.</b> </p>
<p>     I did play with friends, have toys, etc., but nearly all of the play I can remember was structured and often to learn something, do an experiment, etc. (my own preference, not forced upon me). In the midst of all of this in my childhood, <b>two things that remained regular parts of my life were my love of and ability to write well, and my faith.</b> </p>
<p>     At the same time, when I was in third grade my parents were told to be very careful and watch me closely because I was gifted (in the G.A.T.E. program) and highly emotionally-sensitive. If they weren’t careful, my G.A.TE. teacher told them, I was at risk for serious emotional, and maybe even psychological issues. So I learned, subconsciously for the most part, to be careful about that part of my emotional nature. </p>
<p>     Because I was capable of so much—which I’m grateful was nurtured and encouraged by my family—and had the responsibility and expectation I did, I was a perfectionist. I expected a lot of myself, never wanted to let anyone down, and knew that <b>in some parts of my life (especially the health of my family) there was no room for error, so my standard became 100% all the time. That’s a very exhausting way to grow up.</b> </p>
<p>     <b>Disneyland became the place where I could “recapture my childhood,” reconnect with the emotional side of myself I’d buried, and escape once I was in my early-20’s and beyond. </b>The more time I spent there and got to know it, the more valuable it became to me and the more I wanted to learn. It, and it’s creator, Walt Disney, has become an integral part of me, and I use it still as an escape, but also as a teaching tool and a writing inspiration, and a resource (in multiple ways). </p>
<p>     <b>I started with a single sermon. </b>I figured I'd just write it out, cut as much as I needed to to preach it, and that would probably be that. Instead, I cut 75% of what I'd written, and it was still a 50-minute sermon. I realized that there was much more to this than I'd thought, and in July of 2010 I began blogging it at <a href=""http://www.faithandthemagickingdom.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FaithandtheMagicKingdom.net</a> to get my ideas down and develop them. </p>
<p>     The more I visit Disneyland, the more connections I see. Many of them are spiritual in nature, but not all of them.<b>Last year I published my first book, </b><i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFYL6X6/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_1lSgsb0GY018M"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Once Upon YOUR Time</b>: 7 Strategies for Gaining Control of Your Time Through a Tour of the Magic Kingdom</a>, </i>teaching people 7 simple and effective real-world time management strategies . using Disneyland as the ""hook."" It's been very well received and has helped people start to see that there's more to Disneyland than meets the eye...in more ways than one. That's why I wrote this book, and why I want to bring it to you.</p>

<p>     <b>""<i>Faith and The Magic Kingdom </i>is a unique gift to Christians who desire to be more childlike in heart yet be deeply immersed in their identity in Christ. </b>It is biblical, applicable and helps you access the presence of God in a simple way."" ~ Becky Harmon, Identity Expert and CEO of Success not Sabotage Coaching</p>
<p>     ""Walt Disney created one of the most well-loved places in the world, a part of the fabric of society, when Disneyland opened in 1955.

<p>     ""If Disneyland is just a fun place for you to go and nothing more, this book will inspire you to 'look harder!'

<p>     ""Many people view a trip to Disneyland as a way to escape reality for awhile and enter a world of fantasy.

<p>     ""<b>Randy Crane ingeniously provides what amounts to a Disneyland Devotional, drawing spiritual lessons from life inside the Magic Kingdom to improve our walk with Christ. </b>He uses the attractions, the architecture, the parades, the cast members, the characters, near everything about 'The Happiest Place on Earth' as the springboard for solid, accessible Biblical teaching."" ~ David Koenig, Author of <i>Mouse Tales: A Behind-the-Ears Look at Disneyland</i></p>

About Randy
(Who am I & Why Did I Write this Book?)
     I grew up not far from Disneyland. And I grew up in the church. I went to Bible College, and I was a pastor (and still preach as the opportunity arises). But so what? Lots of people could say the same thing. What makes me different? I'm glad you asked.
     My family was usually ill when I was growing up. My Grandma lived with us for the last several years of her life, and I helped my parents take care of her. My Mom was sick several times as well, and I helped take care of her, too. I even quit my first job in part to be home so she could have major surgery without worrying about who was going to take care of Grandma (her mother). I was always a “little adult,” and had to grow up very fast and mature a lot faster than one would typically expect of a child, perhaps partially because I am an only child. A lot was expected of me. “With great power comes great responsibility.” I had the responsibility part, anyway. 
     I did play with friends, have toys, etc., but nearly all of the play I can remember was structured and often to learn something, do an experiment, etc. (my own preference, not forced upon me). In the midst of all of this in my childhood, two things that remained regular parts of my life were my love of and ability to write well, and my faith. 
     At the same time, when I was in third grade my parents were told to be very careful and watch me closely because I was gifted (in the G.A.T.E. program) and highly emotionally-sensitive. If they weren’t careful, my G.A.TE. teacher told them, I was at risk for serious emotional, and maybe even psychological issues. So I learned, subconsciously for the most part, to be careful about that part of my emotional nature. 
     Because I was capable of so much—which I’m grateful was nurtured and encouraged by my family—and had the responsibility and expectation I did, I was a perfectionist. I expected a lot of myself, never wanted to let anyone down, and knew that in some parts of my life (especially the health of my family) there was no room for error, so my standard became 100% all the time. That’s a very exhausting way to grow up. 
     Disneyland became the place where I could “recapture my childhood,” reconnect with the emotional side of myself I’d buried, and escape once I was in my early-20’s and beyond. The more time I spent there and got to know it, the more valuable it became to me and the more I wanted to learn. It, and it’s creator, Walt Disney, has become an integral part of me, and I use it still as an escape, but also as a teaching tool and a writing inspiration, and a resource (in multiple ways). 
     I started with a single sermon. I figured I'd just write it out, cut as much as I needed to to preach it, and that would probably be that. Instead, I cut 75% of what I'd written, and it was still a 50-minute sermon. I realized that there was much more to this than I'd thought, and in July of 2010 I began blogging it at FaithandtheMagicKingdom.net to get my ideas down and develop them. 
     The more I visit Disneyland, the more connections I see. Many of them are spiritual in nature, but not all of them.Last year I published my first book, Once Upon YOUR Time: 7 Strategies for Gaining Control of Your Time Through a Tour of the Magic Kingdom, teaching people 7 simple and effective real-world time management strategies . using Disneyland as the ""hook."" It's been very well received and has helped people start to see that there's more to Disneyland than meets the eye...in more ways than one. That's why I wrote this book, and why I want to bring it to you.




Why I Need Your Support


     So, here we are, a little more than 3 years after that sermon, and I have 113 lessons and reminders for your Christian life found in Disneyland. This is the most comprehensive book on this subject available. Who am I kidding? This is the only book on this subject available! I have labored for 3+ years, pouring everything I have and everything I am into these pages to bring them to YOU. But I can't do it alone. I need your help.
     Publishing a book is not cheap, not even a self-published book.
     OK, that's not true. Anybody can do it for next to nothing. But that doesn't mean it is well written and well edited, has a great cover design and interior layout, and more. All of these things cost money, and often ""you get what you pay for."" This has been my dream for years, so I want it done right. I want my readers to have a book that is the highest possible quality.
     I've hired a professional and experienced editor, and he's spent hours with my manuscript. Then I've spent hours going over his edits. It's gone from good to great (if I do say so myself). I've hired an amazing graphic designer to do my cover. I'll be hiring a professional narrator to do an audio book version. I even hired a professional videographer to shoot and the video you see at the top of this campaign. If I'm going to expect you to sit and watch a video, I want it to be the best it can be!
     Of course, I've offered some great rewards to those of you who support this campaign (more on that below, too), and I need to be able to fulfill those promises. And, naturally, I need to pay the Indiegogo campaign fee.
     All of this takes money--more than I have. But if we do this together, Faith and the Magic Kingdom can make it to market! You can get the best rewards I can think of! And many millions of people can have their lives transformed, all because of what we've done here together! 

    But is it really that good? Well, here's what some people have said about it so far...

     ""Many people view a trip to Disneyland as a way to escape reality for awhile and enter a world of fantasy. But in Faith and the Magic Kingdom, Randy Crane flips that notion on its head. He uses a place that is known and loved for its escapism to teach and explain Christian doctrine, turning the Happiest Place on Earth into the ultimate picture illustration of Bible truths."" ~ Sue Kisenwether, Disney runner and co-host of the Anomaly Supplemental podcast
     ""Randy Crane ingeniously provides what amounts to a Disneyland Devotional, drawing spiritual lessons from life inside the Magic Kingdom to improve our walk with Christ. He uses the attractions, the architecture, the parades, the cast members, the characters, near everything about 'The Happiest Place on Earth' as the springboard for solid, accessible Biblical teaching."" ~ David Koenig, Author of Mouse Tales: A Behind-the-Ears Look at Disneyland

I will also provide frequent updates on the project and answer any questions you may have along the way. The content of the book is complete,but there is still work to be done--completing the edits, finalizing the cover design for the ebook, having the paperback cover designed, etc.--and I'll keep you updated all along the way. I want you to know in advance what you're supporting and know that I'm fully engaged in and committed to this project.

Also, you can choose a reward level but increase your support amount. For instance, let's say you just want a copy of the ebook but want to contribute $50, not $15. No  problem, just select the ebook Perk, and on the next page (with the Contribution Summary) it will ask you how much you want to contribute. There you can change the dollar amount to whatever you want, as long as it's at least the level of the Perk you selected. So, in this example, you would change that from $15 to $50.If you change the dollar amount of a contribution, though, I don't get notified of what the original Perk was you selected. But that's not a problem. Just email me or leave me a comment telling me what the Perk you selected was. You can mark the comment private so only I'll see it.

</tbody></table><p></p></div>","Pop-up Book includes quiz, colouring play mat and press-out activity                       The perfect gift for children you love.
In 570 A.D. Yemen, the tyrant ruler Abraha leads his army of elephants to destroy God’s House, the Ka’ba in the Holy city of Makkah. Armed with only prayers, the Arabs rely on their faith and trust in God to save the Ka’ba and discover some unexpected miracles along the way!
About our Founder and AuthorSalaam / Hello, I'm Hajera, the founder of Shade 7; a new publisher of high quality Pop-up Quranic educational story books & interactive digital 3D apps that help children learn about Islam in a fun way.I trained and qualified as a banking lawyer in the heart of London. In the summer of 2012, I decided to quit my job and spend my life doing something I was extremely passionate about. I knew I wanted to explore my creative side! I had a good think about all the things I’d like to do in my life and thought, if I could do ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, what would it be?Who could I become that would bring the most benefit to the world as a Muslim woman? I really wanted establish something which would allow me to leave a legacy behind.Some key thingscame to mind:
On-going beneficial knowledge;
‘Sadaqah jariyah’ (ceaseless charity); and 
The hadith, or Prophetic saying that “Seven types of people will be shaded by God under His shade on the day when there will be no shade except His.”

Putting knowledge into actionI wanted to turn these key Islamic principles into actions and really make a difference. I'm determined to use my life to create a real legacy in children's Islamic education, not just for me, but for everyone involved.Why It's Important We Gain YOUR Support!We need your support to make our vision a reality and create a real legacy in children's Islamic educational publishing! 
Our vision is to create a legacy of accessible, high quality resources of on-going, beneficial knowledge which aim to (God Willing) inspire generations to come.
We’ve tried to find beautiful, creative and interactive resources that can encourage children to learn more about the magnificent stories from the Holy Quran. 
All the adults we’d spoken to had very fond memories of reading pop-up books as children and told us they’d love to have the same resources to teach their children more about the Quran.
We invite you to support us, to pre-order your exclusive signed copy and be a part of the Shade 7 legacy to make our vision a reality for all children to enjoy!Features of the book: Why it's so special!
Hand drawn & painted, creative illustrations with exceptional colour and design throughout the book

Colouring play mat and press-out pieces to create your own army of elephants to re-enact some of the historic scenes from the story
Hardback cover with high quality finish throughout
Beautiful, luxurious, gold foil stamped, hand designed title on the cover
Our book is double the size of a standard children’s pop-up story book, containing 13 spreads
Each of the pop-up features in the book are put together by hand
What We Need & What You GetWe need as many of you as possible to order a copy (or copies) of our magnificent Pop-up Story of The Elephant: Surah Al-Fil Pop-up Book to arrive God willing, in time for Eid 2014.

Our Charitable Commitment 
At Shade 7 we firmly believe in supporting the religious, spiritual and educational development of all children.Our commitment is to donate a minimum of 25 books for every 1,000 copies sold as gifts to less fortunate children around the world via our Charity Partner READ Foundation (Registered Charity Number 1114808) whose focus is on education for children in rural areas.We’d love for you to help us deliver on our promise to help make less fortunate children really happy too!The ImpactThis project is much more than just publishing children’s Quranic Pop-up Books and 3D apps. It has a much deeper impact and intention for the future of children’s Islamic educational publishing.We’ve summarised the 7 key things which our project is all about: 
Creating a Legacy of outstandingly beautiful, long-lasting resources to pass on beneficial knowledge that teaches children about the importance of faith and the rich, valuable lessons from the stories in the Quran.
Creating Exceptional and inspirational designs of the highest quality in the material we publish.
Making our published materials Accessible to all children, from all backgrounds and faiths to enjoy. This is highlighted particularly through our commitment with our Charity Partner READ Foundation who champion education for all.  
Igniting a curiosity in all children to Discover the profound and exciting and moral stories in the Qur’an. For Muslim children, we hope it will inspire the discovery into the beauty of the Arabic language to understand the depth of these stories further.
Creating innovative Educational resources to make learning about Islam truly inspiring and fun for all.
Developing a deeper sense of Respect and tolerance in children from an early age towards other faiths and beliefs, bridging gaps and highlighting the similarities in the stories of the Old Testament to the Quranic stories in particular – something which will develop further as our series progresses.
Developing a child’s Spiritual needs and interests as they grow older, cultivating an awareness of their Creator and creating a bond with Him through fond memories of reading these sensational stories.

<h3>The Wild Hunt's 2013 Fall Funding Drive</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>""There are few resources I feel benefits all in the Pagan umbrella. The Wild Hunt is on the top of that short list for me."" </i>- <b>David Salisbury</b>, author of <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>The Deep Heart of Witchcraft: Expanding the Core of Magickal Practice</i></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Jason Pitzl-Waters, a journalist who covers the religious movement known as Modern Paganism. Approximately one year ago, I decided to make The Wild Hunt, a Pagan news site which I've been running continuously since 2004, an independent entity again after a year of being hosted by an outside media company. It wasn't an easy decision, and it came with fiscal, logistical, and technical headaches, but I believe, and still believe, that The Wild Hunt's mission to provide news, information, context, and unique perspectives about our interconnected religious communities needed to grow and exist as something outside the confines of its previous host. </p>
<p>In taking that step, I also did something unprecedented in my history running this site: I brought on staff writers and columnists, and decided to pay them for their high-quality contributions. I wanted The Wild Hunt to stop simply being about me and my perspectives, for it to become a true Pagan news magazine and daily destination for Pagans, Heathens, polytheists, pantheists, and the many other branches of our ever-expanding religious communities. One year later, I think we have made important steps down that road, and I'm incredibly proud of the work we've done. Now, as we get ready to start another year, we need our community, our readership, more than ever if The Wild Hunt is going to thrive and continue its mission. </p>
<p>Today is the beginning of a new Fall Funding Drive, and we're asking for a base budget of $10,000 dollars to run for another year, and we're hoping that you will help us not only meet this goal, but surpass it and allow us to do even more. The more we raise, the more we can do. Want to see more regular columnists? Want to see more staff writers? Would you like to see that I actually receive a salary from The Wild Hunt in 2013? Then I would love to see us push well past that base goal in the coming month. I know that there are many thousands of readers out there, and I know it would only take a fraction donating to not only fund us, but help us greatly expanding the coming year. </p></span><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Here's what $10,000 dollars will do:</p><p>

their beauty and spectacular look, you can increasingly see more and more
Weimaraners on the streets of big cities. In some cases, however, these dogs unfortunately
end up living in shelters as they get abandoned by their owners who initially
just picked them amongst other breeds due to their beauty and not because they
were the right breed of dog for them. Is this dog for you?In 2011 we
published a Spanish website to answer some of the questions that Weimaraner
owners had and this website quickly gained popularity. The site now has
around 3.000 visits per month, is third in Google searches and we receive more
and more letters from people asking for tips and advice. http://www.mibracodeweimar.comThis made
us think that we should share our experiences more widely by writing a book in
English with the help of a professional Dog Whisperer featuring information
on how you can train, educate and basically get to know your precious dog
closer.

We
would like to help current and future  Weimar owners discover whether  this breed fits with their lifestyle, while
also learning some basics in obedience and puppy trainingWhat to expect from this book?14  chapters carefully
chosen to include information, advice and tips on:
Origins of the breed
Breeding, health, medical and temperament questions
Vital Statistics: height and weight, life expectancy, intelligence
Characteristics
Temperament
Coat, colors and types
Grooming, nail, ear and teeth care
Feeding and Health issues 
Emergency cases
Training
Obedience
Activity requirements & sports you can share with your dog

<p>In 2009, Political

to expose the involvement of American rightwing evangelicals in attacks on
LGBTQ rights and women’s reproductive freedom. In Uganda, he filmed the

<h2><b>Our Goals</b></h2><p><b>Trafika Europe</b> wants to celebrate what is best in new literature across the
continent. Our goal is also
to bridge the gap between old and new publishing models and reach out to a new
generation online. We're especially keen to find and translate exciting new talent in
Europe, often by offering them an international, English-speaking audience for
the very first time.</p>
<p><b>. . . and featuring Trafika Europe Radio</b>! Enjoy more of the literature you love. Besides great audio readings, we'll go behind the scenes, to host discussions with authors, publishers and
translators, cover book launches and readings, festivals and other events, and play
""literary"" music from across Europe. By partnering with existing
literary magazines, university departments, and publishers across
Europe, we can help build real community radio for literature in Europe, and honour and connect with the
many existing efforts already underway. We'll also help you keep up with events with our updated calendar of literary happenings throughout the continent.</p>
<p>Our launch will include events co-hosted by Ron Butlin  at <b><i>Summerhall</i></b>
during the <b><i>Edinburgh Fringe Festival</i></b> in August, the biggest performance, arts and
literary festival in the world. Our launch focus is on writing from Europe's
northern islands, including new works from Scottish Gaelic, Irish Gaelic, and
from the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway.</p>

Last year, my editor, Tara Frauendienst, and I ran a campaign for editing funds on <em>Roll the Bones</em>, the third book in my <em>Peter the Wolf</em> Series. We’ve completed edits on the final book, <em>Thicker Than Blood</em>, and now I’m looking to fund another campaign to pay for her edits. As with the campaign before I won’t be making any funds from this campaign and all contributions will go toward paying Tara.</p>
<p>For those interested, the funds will go to pay for my final <s>semester</s> class of college so that I officially have a degree.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This time around, the incentives for contributions are:</strong></p>
<p>For a $5 donation, you get an ebook copy of <em>Thicker Than Blood</em> a few weeks before the final release, and a copy of a new dark fantasy release, <em>A Boy and His Dawg</em>. You can choose between mobi, epub, or PDF editions, though special requests may be offered if your eReader needs some other file format. All contributors can get their names listed on the back page of the book, either their real name or their online handle, whichever they prefer.</p>
<p>For $10, you get both the books offered at the $5 plus a copy of my fallen angel dark fantasy <em>Saving Gabriel</em>.</p>
<p>For $15, contributors will get all of the above plus copies of the previous three <em>Peter the Wolf</em> books. This is the best option to choose if you’ve not yet started the series and want to pick up the whole set at a discount.</p>
<p>Finally, for donating $25, you get all the above eBooks plus copies of <em>Waiting for a Miracle</em> and <em>A Frosty Girl’s Cure</em>. So for your generous contribution, you’ll get a complete series about skinwalkers, a new novel about moon wolves, another about fallen angels, and a pair of novels about super villains and superheroes. Not a bad haul, all told.</p>
<p>Additionally, as added incentive, I (Tara) will bake a batch of homemade cookies (your choice of flavor), for any contributors who donate $100 or more. That will be shipped USPS Priority Mail.</p>

<p><strong>So what’s the final book about?</strong> (Some spoilers below if you haven’t read the first 3 books.)</p>
<p>After escaping a life of sexual slavery, Peter Holmes has fought weredogs, golems, and vampires, and he’s won his freedom from a term of indentured servitude to a harpy. Yet even with these victories behind him, he still has yet to tame his inner demons and come to terms with his animal urges as a lycanthrope.</p>
<p>His return to Dallas, Pennsylvania also brings new dilemmas with the weredogs and his adoptive family, and his muddled sexuality forces him to reconsider his relationship with Alice. Even as he struggles to behave, Peter’s wolf becomes infatuated with his enigmatic best friend Pi, who thinks that becoming a skinwalker is romantic.

<p>Faced with a moral dilemma, Peter must decide where his loyalties lie.

<h3>Action-packed South Indian stories</h3>
<p>Most of the writing that gets translated into English from Indian languages is serious literary fiction, focused either on social issues or ancient history.

<p>My name is Iris, and I am an AmeriCorps worker stationed at John Amesse Elementary in the Denver Public School District. An integral part of my decision to join AmeriCorps stemmed from the desire to positively impact literacy and reinvigorate creative writing instruction in the classroom. In my time at Amesse, I have developed and implemented a creative writing enrichment program that includes a literary magazine component. I have been collecting student writing throughout the year, and over the next few months, students from neighboring high schools will join me to serve as volunteer editors. We will be teaming up with Tattered Cover, a local bookstore and independent printing press, to produce a beautiful magazine at the end of the school year. </p>
<p>John Amesse Elementary is a Title I school (96% of our students receive free or reduced lunch)--funding for extra-curricular and supplementary programming is always a struggle. Please come on board with us to ensure that all 658 Amesse students receive a copy. I have seen the skill, imagination, and wisdom of my students through their writing. This school deserves to showcase its best writers in <em>The Life That Surrounds Us</em>, the 2012-13 literary magazine as named by Amesse student writers.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for each Amesse student to receive a copy of the magazine, we need to raise a minimum of $4,000 for printing and production costs. Any leftover funding will be put toward a literary magazine for the 2013-14 school year. </p>
<p>All donation levels will get you a copy of the magazine. Any donation above $20.00 ensures that your name will be included on the Contributor's List. From there, we will be reserving advertising space for donors inside and on the back cover. A $1,000 donation will get you everything, and your complimentary magazines will be signed by student authors! Please see the Perks section for details.</p>
<p>If I fail to reach my goal, we will still print as many magazines as we possibly can. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will encourage a school culture of reading, writing, and creative expression. My students need to know that they deserve a space on the blank page. Please help me prove that to them. </p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>We can't see what we haven't healed. It is time for all sexual trauma survivors to re-claim their power so that we can watch out for our children and co-create a healthy world.</strong></p>
<p>What is this 1 in 3 thing all about?</p>
<p>It’s a sad truth, but statistics tell us that one in three children has experienced childhood sexual abuse. Most of these women (and men) live lives of deep isolation and quiet desperation.</p>
<p>My book <em>Blossom-Your 7 Step Journey to Healing Childhood Sexual Trauma</em> is designed to help these women and men take charge and heal their hearts so that they can bring their light and gift to the world.</p>
<p>You might have heard this quote by the Dalai Lama - “It will be the Western woman who will help the planet at this time.” For that to happen, many women still need to come into their true, authentic power. I beleive that <em>Blossom</em> can make a huge contribution to this shift.</p>
<strong>Meet Carolin Hauser</strong>
</div>
<div>
<br/>Hi there. For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Carolin Hauser. I’m a mother, a wife, an author, a dancer, and I am 1 in 3.</div>
<div>
<p>As you may or may not know, I’ve spent my life since the age of fifteen in search of finding a way to heal my own broken heart. I had to overcome severe eating disorders, and later, lived through co-dependent and abusive relationships. Then, continuing on my search, I even left my home country, Germany, and went to La Gomera, which is a small island off of the West Coast of Africa. I lived there in a tent in an intentional community, wedged between the huge mountains and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>I then left that part of the world and traveled across the Atlantic Ocean and over the Rocky Mountains to come to the West Coast of the United States, to Santa Barbara, where I live now. I love it here, compared to Germany it’s so much nicer. I live here with my children, my husband, and my community and I’m very happy to be here. My journey also led me through the study of naturopathic medicine and humanistic psychotherapy in Germany. I’ve  also been immersed in the world of Family Constellations, and have become a Family Constellations facilitator, and now work in that capacity. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>For the past three years I’ve been focused on taking everything that I’ve learned in healing myself and in working with other women, and that's how <em>Blossom</em> was born.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I need you?</strong></p>
<p><em>Blossom</em> is written and it is edited, and I’ve really done all that I can do on my own. My husband has supported me greatly and lots of friends and people from my family have supported me greatly, but I’m at a point where I need the village to help spread the message, because it’s about that time. The book is ready to go to publication and it’s ready to do its work.</p>
<p>I’m doing this campaign to raise funds (10k to be exact) so that I can have the support and the tools that I need in order to get <em>Blossom</em> into the world, to publish it and to launch it successfully in November 2012, and to make it accessible to as many women as possible.</p>
<p>If you decide to participate, there is a whole list of nice perks that you get and of course, the greatest reward for you will be the transformation that women may have because <em>Blossom</em> will make it into their hands. (Good Karma!!!)</p>
<p><strong>Here is how you can help:</strong></p>
<p>Get your credit card out and give as much as you can.</p>
<p>For $15 you get <em>Blossom</em> (yes, the whole book) in its current PDF form.</p>
<p>For $1,000 you get to spend an entire VIP day with me.</p>
<p>There is lots of room in between... just look over to the right and pick a perk that you like.</p>
<p><br/>Additionally, or perhaps more importantly, tell all your friends, your mother, your sister - anybody you know who we don't - to give us their money!</p>

Hi there. For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Carolin Hauser. I’m a mother, a wife, an author, a dancer, and I am 1 in 3.

A secretive group of Analysts use the satellite feed to warn settlements of danger before it strikes. But their view of the Grid is only refreshed every 30 minutes, and the demons that live on the edge of their vision are getting craftier in their raids.Anyuka is on the verge of becoming a full-fledged Analyst, working directly under her father in their base hidden in the mountains. A base they never leave. Nor do they permit any form of wired or wireless communication for fear of giving away their position. To get their warnings out to the settlers before it's too late, they use Couriers riding armored SlitPods, the fastest tech left over from before the apocalypse. But the mounting price of their secrecy forces Anyuka to question her father’s stark moral calculus, and begin to doubt their entire strategy for protecting humankind.Finn is a veteran of the war to protect the Grid, leading the team of couriers on their Slitpods through this hellscape of bandits, demons, and mysterious outsiders in a daily race to save outlying settlements from destruction. The SlitPods they ride are immensely powerful machines but, built on old, forgotten tech, they are ticking time bombs. Once they suffer enough damage they instantly explode.

crack-down on civil liberties at home, whilst preparing for increased military
activity abroad. Seemingly lost in the arguments for bombing campaigns or
international “boots on the ground” is the fact that a progressive, democratic,

<p>The escalating military conflict in Syria has recently seen Turkey directly attack Rojavan defence forces.

blogs. We hope this campaign can be a small example of the kinds of practical
solidarity we need to be showing with Rojava.</p>
<p><b>What Do We Want to Do?</b></p>
<p>We want to raise £3000 for projects connected to the
struggle in Rojava. This money will be split into a few different parts:</p>
<p><b>1)</b> £2000 to Kobane, to
be split into two parts:</p>
<p><span><b>·</b><span> 
</span></span>£1400 to Kobane reconstruction, sent directly to
Kobane.</p>
<p><span><b>·</b><span><b> </b>
</span></span>£600 for medical supplies to support direct medical work in the region. This will pay for life saving medical supplies that are expensive and hard to obtain in Rojava. The supplies will include tourniquets, hemostatic dressings, chest seals, and trauma bandages, all essential in preventing avoidable deaths by treating the serious injuries that are suffered by both civilians and YPG/J members in Rojava.<br/></p>
<p><b>2) </b>£1000 to Kurdish projects in the UK. The
struggle in Rojava is being supported by a large network of Kurdish communities
across the world. By helping Kurdish projects in the UK, we are helping build
the basis for longer term support for Rojava. </p>
<p>Any extra money we raise will go directly towards
reconstruction in Kobane.</p>
<p><b>When?</b></p>
<p>We hope to raise this money by the New Year. If we
are short we will continue raising funds until we reach our target.</p><p><b>£3000, is this all?</b></p><p>We hope not!

£1400 to Kobane reconstruction, sent directly to
Kobane.
· 
£600 for medical supplies to support direct medical work in the region. This will pay for life saving medical supplies that are expensive and hard to obtain in Rojava. The supplies will include tourniquets, hemostatic dressings, chest seals, and trauma bandages, all essential in preventing avoidable deaths by treating the serious injuries that are suffered by both civilians and YPG/J members in Rojava.
2) £1000 to Kurdish projects in the UK. The
struggle in Rojava is being supported by a large network of Kurdish communities
across the world. By helping Kurdish projects in the UK, we are helping build
the basis for longer term support for Rojava. 
Any extra money we raise will go directly towards
reconstruction in Kobane.
When?
We hope to raise this money by the New Year. If we
are short we will continue raising funds until we reach our target.£3000, is this all?We hope not! Our plan is to start with something we think should be achievable and we hope to do larger fundraising campaigns next year. Hopefully we will involve more groups from the UK and Europe in this next campaign.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Force of Nature is a lyrical compilation that explores the intersections of African womanhood, emotional vulnerability, and spiritual liberation. This body of work is an ode to the divine feminine energy and power that exists within all African women.<br/><br/>My name is Odemi Pessu, and I am the author of Force of Nature. I was inspired to write this book because African women globally are subjugated to societal expectations that force us to hide our feelings and complexities and look to external factors for strength when God’s power already lives within us. We are often told we are too much and too little all at the same time. But, like forces of nature, we cannot be confined to societal definitions of who we should be and what we should feel.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading Force of Nature, you will discover the innate power that shines through when we unabashedly embrace who we are and what we feel. Ultimately, I hope this book will prompt you to honor the divine feminine energy that lives within you.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll join me in embracing the complexities of African womanhood, exploring decolonization of the mind, reconciling tradition with growth, rejecting patriarchal oppression, and discovering new ways to love ourselves deeply and fully through poems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“By Any Means Necessary” — a poem about colonialism, Black liberation, and Western Christianity.</li>
<li>“Welcome Home” — a poem about identity, solitude, and the healing power of Mother Earth.</li>
<li>“Keeping Score” — a poem critiquing society’s silence regarding violence against women.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy challenging the status quo, have a passion for women’s empowerment, and appreciate thought-provoking, yet lyrical, literature. Force of Nature speaks to African women and women of color who want to grapple with vulnerability and womanhood in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Force of Nature inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I work to honor myself more authentically each day?</li>
<li>How can I utilize vulnerability to strengthen my relationships, and what is keeping me from experiencing my emotions more freely and deeply?</li>
<li>What intrinsic work can I do to decolonize my mind and embrace the divinity that exists within me?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing vulnerability, spirituality, and the nuances of Black womanhood more frequently will change us all for the better.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.</li>
<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring 2021.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

<p><br/><strong>“The Divine”</strong> is a multicultural 90+ page coloring book for people of all ages (especially the child in all of us) inspired by folklore and spirituality from the Philippines (Diwas), Haiti (Lwas of Vodou) and Brazil (Orixas of Candomble and folklore of the Tupi Tribe). <strong>Pre-order YOURS today!</strong><br/><br/>Thirteen divinities from each culture are represented along with the folklore and symbolism associated with each of the divinities. Included throughout the book are inspirational quotes, mindfulness activities and poetry featuring Eniafe Isis of All Her Words. In addition to the 39 divinities, there is a surprise included in the book.</p>
<p>While many of us grew up with the mythologies about Greek and Roman gods, as well as stories like Cinderella, Little Mermaid and Robin Hood, few of us have been exposed to the stories included in “The Divine” — stories that have been passed down from generation to generation through traditional dance, music and oral storytelling. “The Divine” draws the connections between these cultures, beliefs and that which is always sacred, bringing to the forefront the cultures of the diaspora that are rich in wisdom but rarely given the attention they deserve.</p>
<p>From the Americas to Africa to the islands, let’s continue to carry and pass down these truths.</p>
<p>It's taken a village.</p>

<p><br/>Some years ago, when I was teaching a CreativFolkloric workshop for MAS Summer Camp at the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts in San Francisco, I was having my students choreograph movements inspired by Yemanja (Brazil), La Sirene (Haiti) and Magwayan (Visayas, Philippines) — all divine feminine spirits of the ocean. Having the kids color illustrations of those divine spirits of the ocean seemed like a good way to inspire them. However, I was unable to find any existing illustrations online that I could use. As a last resort, I set out to create some of my own coloring pages using Adobe Illustrator to adapt images I found online.</p>
<p>And so was born the idea for “The Divine” coloring book — a personal creative journey of many months that has also been a very transformative and healing process for me. Art brings healing. Creating is medicine.</p>
<p>I am just so blessed to have the advice and guidance of many mentors, advisors and teachers, whose heritage and ancestry is from these cultures, who are extremely knowledgeable about the folklore represented in this project, and some of whom actively practice these spiritualities. I am greatly indebted to them for their help in ensuring that each story and culture is honored and represented with the greatest respect and with due mindfulness about cultural appropriation.</p>
<p>A special thank you to all my friends, fam and guides who believed in me even when I didn’t believe in myself. With your help, I hope to continue to breathe life into the project.</p>
<p>I hope each person sees a little bit of themselves through these stories, and that their symbolism resonates within you. I also hope that you will find these coloring pages not just educational, but also healing and therapeutic.</p>
<p>You are divine, and the divine is you.<br/> </p>

<p><br/>Hey all, I’m Christine Joy Amagan Ferrer (most people know me as ‘Tine’). I am a pinay multidisciplinary creative from San Francisco of Tagalog, Iloko and Visayan known roots. I am a cultural movement youth arts educator and dance artist by day, and a designer and media producer by night. I am inspired by folklore, spirituality and cultural movement storytelling.</p>
<p>I’ve been studying and practicing Haitian, Brazilian and Philippine folkloric dance for a little more than a decade. Over the years, I’ve traveled on a few cultural immersions to Haiti and the Philippines to expand my spiritual and cultural growth. And my connections to all these cultures -- through spirituality, dance, music and song -- have deeply shaped my life, carried me through my struggles, taught me to root myself in joy, brought me healing, connected me to my ancestors, and to the God within and the God without. Each day, I learn more and more. And for that, I am incredibly grateful. “The Divine” coloring book is my offering.<br/> </p>

Pre-order YOURS today!Thirteen divinities from each culture are represented along with the folklore and symbolism associated with each of the divinities. Included throughout the book are inspirational quotes, mindfulness activities and poetry featuring Eniafe Isis of All Her Words. In addition to the 39 divinities, there is a surprise included in the book.
While many of us grew up with the mythologies about Greek and Roman gods, as well as stories like Cinderella, Little Mermaid and Robin Hood, few of us have been exposed to the stories included in “The Divine” — stories that have been passed down from generation to generation through traditional dance, music and oral storytelling. “The Divine” draws the connections between these cultures, beliefs and that which is always sacred, bringing to the forefront the cultures of the diaspora that are rich in wisdom but rarely given the attention they deserve.
From the Americas to Africa to the islands, let’s continue to carry and pass down these truths.
It's taken a village.
I may be the creative behind this project, but I couldn’t have done it without these phenomenal folks. Thank you!

To all the families and kids who have been helping me with the marketing materials AND to all my friends who have so generously put up with my numerous requests for advice, I have soooooo much love and gratitude for you. 

Some years ago, when I was teaching a CreativFolkloric workshop for MAS Summer Camp at the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts in San Francisco, I was having my students choreograph movements inspired by Yemanja (Brazil), La Sirene (Haiti) and Magwayan (Visayas, Philippines) — all divine feminine spirits of the ocean.

A special thank you to all my friends, fam and guides who believed in me even when I didn’t believe in myself. With your help, I hope to continue to breathe life into the project.
I hope each person sees a little bit of themselves through these stories, and that their symbolism resonates within you. I also hope that you will find these coloring pages not just educational, but also healing and therapeutic.
You are divine, and the divine is you. 

Hey all, I’m Christine Joy Amagan Ferrer (most people know me as ‘Tine’). I am a pinay multidisciplinary creative from San Francisco of Tagalog, Iloko and Visayan known roots. I am a cultural movement youth arts educator and dance artist by day, and a designer and media producer by night. I am inspired by folklore, spirituality and cultural movement storytelling.
I’ve been studying and practicing Haitian, Brazilian and Philippine folkloric dance for a little more than a decade. Over the years, I’ve traveled on a few cultural immersions to Haiti and the Philippines to expand my spiritual and cultural growth.

Most of you know, I have been working very hard for the last few months, prepping for the launch of “The Divine” coloring book, hustling hard on its production. But in the present moment, I have had to pause and reflect on how I, as a Filipina, non-Black American sharing stories that represent heritages that are not my own, can honor, celebrate and uplift Black Power.
To be fully honest and transparent, it has been challenging trying to navigate how to better support Black lives, Black families, Black communities, Black culture, basically Black EVERYTHING, with my work on this platform -- being that I am a practitioner of Haitian and Brazilian folkloric cultural dance forms of the diaspora but NOT Black.
Though I had hoped to launch the project in June, I decided to postpone it. Because I realized that sometimes it’s important for some of us to fall back, so others can step forward.
What matters most is the day-to-day. How we live our lives, treat and teach one another, and hold space for others and ourselves, even when we don't fully understand it all.

They can see every photo that’s ever been released, and unearth your most intimate details through posts that have been shared. But Rory Walsh’s life has been narrated through the lens of someone else. How can he create his own identity when everything that people see is of a version of him that doesn’t exist?<br/><br/>My name is Julia Tvardovskaya, and I am the author of <i>Identifiable</i>. I wrote this book not only because of my passion for telling stories, but because I believe that this story in particular is necessary to be told at exactly this point in time.<br/><br/>Although the internet and social media have immense benefits, including having the chance to connect with friends and family across the world, they also pose great challenges to us as individuals and as members of society. Children have a virtual footprint that is born well before they are with parents sharing intimate details that will follow them for the rest of their lives. Polarization has continued to grow as algorithms manipulate information and as individuals screen virtual friends by their political affiliation or religious beliefs, removing the capacity for true dialogue. As our use of social media expands, so does our need to truly understand it. With this novel, I hope that we can all ponder the question “what will happen if we’re not more conscious of our use of virtual social networks?”</p><p> </p><h3>Let's go deeper...</h3><div>
<p>When a corporatocracy gains power in the United States, the government of the Founding Fathers is completely dissolved. The three largest technology companies come together to form the Corporate Council, a governing body that prides itself on the freedom of information. In pursuit of their mission, they create a technology known as the AIP, the Accessible Internet Product, that is injected into every individual at birth... voluntarily. The AIP works its way through the body and attaches itself to the occipital lobe, giving each individual viewing access to the internet in their brain as though there is a computer monitor just behind their eyes. Working on a thoughtsearch algorithm, each individual sees results that align with exactly what they want to see.<br/><br/>The eyes, now becoming facial recognition scanners, allow an individual to just look at anyone else and to instantaneously see everything that’s ever been posted about them on the Internet. There are no tags, no way to hide. When everything can be learned about an individual just by looking at them, the decision to love or hate them becomes immediate, causing people to classify and segregate themselves into communal systems, known as broods.<br/><br/>Rory Walsh, born into his parents’ brood, has had his entire life documented through the lens of his mother, Nora. Like any mother, she wants the best for her son, curating a social profile for him that will guarantee his acceptance into their traditionalist brood, forever.<br/><br/>But the version of him that Nora creates doesn’t exist.<br/><br/>The Rory Walsh that everyone sees when they look at him, is not the true Rory Walsh. He doesn’t belong in the brood for which he’s been bred, in the virtual skin he’s been given. In defiance of his parents, he goes on a journey to override the AIP system, to find a way to create his own identity, and to show that identity to the rest of the world. With the help of his best friend, Sebastian Desjardins, the wealthy heir to a large lobster exporter, he sets out to leave the world he’s known for an adventure to find a better life... a different life... a life he can call his own. But will he make it, or will the trek destroy him?<br/> </p>
<h3>Let's fall in love.</h3>
</div><div>You will love this book if you’ve ever wondered what our world could be like in the future. Just one option of many, this book touches on current cultural themes while following characters that struggle with their past and search for... and hide pieces of... themselves, while also celebrating the changing planet on which we all live (just in a world where the internet is utterly inescapable).<br/><br/><i>Identifiable </i>speaks to adults and emerging adults who want to explore a world not too far away from our own, where the themes of identity, community, and technology all intertwine.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Identifiable</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How do we create our own identities that may be so different from others’ expectations of us?</li>
<li>How much more challenging does dialogue become when communities voluntarily segregate themselves?</li>
<li>What challenges do we all face when the only information we see is that which we want to see?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Julia Tvardovskaya, also known affectionately as JT, is a full-time parent and a part-time author after having graduated from Georgetown University (Master of Business Administration and Master of Science in Foreign Service) in May of 2021. She is passionate about sharing stories in print, on the stage, and on the screen.<br/><br/>JT decided to write this book for two reasons. After studying Lifespan Development and watching the documentary A Social Dilemma, she became interested in the impacts of social media on children, which have been widely studied, but particularly on the generation of children growing up with a virtual profile that predates them and that they had no say in creating. She was also particularly attuned to the polarization of society and wanted to more understand social media’s role in that polarization.<br/><br/>When she’s not chasing a toddler around or thinking about future book ideas, you can find JT curled up with a book, planning post-COVID dream travel, re-watching Gilmore Girls or Schitt’s Creek, or doing baby yoga (imagine goat yoga, but with a different kind of kid!).<br/><br/>For more information about JT or Identifiable, you can connect with her at jultvard@gmail.com, on Instagram <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jul_tvard/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@jul_tvard</a>, or through her website <a href=""https://www.julia-tvardovskaya.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.julia-tvardovskaya.com</a>. <br/> </p>

</div></div>","The Story of IdentifiableIdentifiable takes you into a world where just by looking at you, an individual can learn everything about you instantaneously. They can see every photo that’s ever been released, and unearth your most intimate details through posts that have been shared. But Rory Walsh’s life has been narrated through the lens of someone else. How can he create his own identity when everything that people see is of a version of him that doesn’t exist?My name is Julia Tvardovskaya, and I am the author of Identifiable. I wrote this book not only because of my passion for telling stories, but because I believe that this story in particular is necessary to be told at exactly this point in time.Although the internet and social media have immense benefits, including having the chance to connect with friends and family across the world, they also pose great challenges to us as individuals and as members of society. Children have a virtual footprint that is born well before they are with parents sharing intimate details that will follow them for the rest of their lives. Polarization has continued to grow as algorithms manipulate information and as individuals screen virtual friends by their political affiliation or religious beliefs, removing the capacity for true dialogue. As our use of social media expands, so does our need to truly understand it. With this novel, I hope that we can all ponder the question “what will happen if we’re not more conscious of our use of virtual social networks?” Let's go deeper...
When a corporatocracy gains power in the United States, the government of the Founding Fathers is completely dissolved. The three largest technology companies come together to form the Corporate Council, a governing body that prides itself on the freedom of information. In pursuit of their mission, they create a technology known as the AIP, the Accessible Internet Product, that is injected into every individual at birth... voluntarily. The AIP works its way through the body and attaches itself to the occipital lobe, giving each individual viewing access to the internet in their brain as though there is a computer monitor just behind their eyes. Working on a thoughtsearch algorithm, each individual sees results that align with exactly what they want to see.The eyes, now becoming facial recognition scanners, allow an individual to just look at anyone else and to instantaneously see everything that’s ever been posted about them on the Internet. There are no tags, no way to hide. When everything can be learned about an individual just by looking at them, the decision to love or hate them becomes immediate, causing people to classify and segregate themselves into communal systems, known as broods.Rory Walsh, born into his parents’ brood, has had his entire life documented through the lens of his mother, Nora. Like any mother, she wants the best for her son, curating a social profile for him that will guarantee his acceptance into their traditionalist brood, forever.But the version of him that Nora creates doesn’t exist.The Rory Walsh that everyone sees when they look at him, is not the true Rory Walsh. He doesn’t belong in the brood for which he’s been bred, in the virtual skin he’s been given. In defiance of his parents, he goes on a journey to override the AIP system, to find a way to create his own identity, and to show that identity to the rest of the world. With the help of his best friend, Sebastian Desjardins, the wealthy heir to a large lobster exporter, he sets out to leave the world he’s known for an adventure to find a better life... a different life... a life he can call his own. But will he make it, or will the trek destroy him? 
Let's fall in love.
You will love this book if you’ve ever wondered what our world could be like in the future. Just one option of many, this book touches on current cultural themes while following characters that struggle with their past and search for... and hide pieces of... themselves, while also celebrating the changing planet on which we all live (just in a world where the internet is utterly inescapable).Identifiable speaks to adults and emerging adults who want to explore a world not too far away from our own, where the themes of identity, community, and technology all intertwine.Ultimately, I hope that Identifiable inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
How do we create our own identities that may be so different from others’ expectations of us?
How much more challenging does dialogue become when communities voluntarily segregate themselves?
What challenges do we all face when the only information we see is that which we want to see?

I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!
 
What We Need & What You'll Get

<p><em>Chasing Olives</em> is a book I am writing that chronicles my participation in the intensive format of a therapy called Surrogate Partner Therapy (SPT). SPT is a profoundly complex and delicate form of exposure therapy that addresses dysfunction in one's ability to experience emotional and physical intimacy. In my case, the dysfunction stemmed from childhood sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Surrogate Partner Therapy is conducted within the framework of an authentic, albeit clinically motivated and time-limited, relationship between a client and trained surrogate partner. The relationship is supervised by a licensed psychotherapist with whom the client processes thoughts, feelings, and reactions generated from the emotional and physical intimacy inherent in the relationship.</p>
<p>SPT is not widely accepted by the traditional psychotherapy community. Traditional psychotherapy relies on rigid boundaries that forbid touch beyond a handshake or supportive hug. There is considerable hand-wringing over SPT's flexible boundaries that allow the fullest expression of intimacy according to the client's needs.</p>
<p>For one year prior to SPT, I worked with a psychotherapist to reveal and understand the cognitive distortions I carried that are common to those who suffered egregious boundary violations as children. After so many hours of therapy, however, I could not say that I was close to being healed.</p>
<p>Shame, fear of touch, fear of intimacy, and a pervasive numb disconnectedness through which I filtered the entirety of my life experience crippled every aspect of my existence. Continuing to talk about it wasn't helping me to resolve the ingrained trauma response.</p>
<p>Surrogate Partner Therapy is the therapy that healed deeply rooted dysfunction and allowed me to embrace life and love with the courage of an open heart. That is the story I will share in <em>Chasing Olives</em>.</p>
<h3>My Motivation To Write This Book</h3>
<p>Surrogate Partner Therapy transformed my life in a way that traditional psychotherapy could not. I found freedom from the shame and fear that ruled my life and now feel a peace I've never known. I share my story with deep compassion for those who continue to suffer, and with the hope that <em>Chasing Olives</em> will help to draw attention to this remarkable therapy.</p>
<h3>Coming To A Movie Theater Near You</h3>
<p>Among the films previewed at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, audiences screened <em>The Surrogate</em>. This movie recounts the true story of the therapeutic relationship between surrogate partner Cheryl Cohen Greene (played by Helen Hunt) and author/poet Mark O'Brien (played by John Hawkes). Anticipated to be an Oscar contender, the film will be released nationwide in Fall 2012 under a new title, <em>The Sessions</em>.</p>
<p>Greene worked with O'Brien two decades ago. Surrogate partners continue to work today in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Israel under the auspices of the International Professional Surrogate Association (IPSA).</p>
<p>The success of the movie at Sundance and its upcoming release nationally has generated media interest in Surrogate Partner Therapy. Hopefully, as more people become aware of SPT via media coverage, <em>Chasing Olives</em> will prove helpful to those needing additional insight.</p>

<strong>Story of My Book</strong> </h2><p>The book is about the practical lessons and principles I’ve learned as a result of growing up without my father. I wrote this because of the ever-present need for strong, compassionate, committed and positive male role models in our society. I want to encourage and empower others who have grown up without their fathers and give them practical principles to help push them towards greatness. My book will publish in October of 2019.</p><p><i>Without A Father - From Fear to Fait</i>h<br/>This book uncovers the deep wounds of pain, anger, and resentment that developed in me as a result of not having my father in my life. Through life’s hardships, I am able to use my faith to conquer all of my fears and become the man I was destined to be.<br/><br/>My name is Kenny Joyner and I am the author of Without A Father - from Fear to Faith. I wrote this book as a resource to help strengthen those who did not grow up with their fathers.

<strong>The Book</strong> - <strong><i>Without A Father - From Fear to Faith</i></strong>
</h2><p>This book is written in 4 Parts...</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>The Beginning</strong> - <i>You’re Just Like Your Father</i> - Your beginning doesn't determine your end. In a traumatizing scene, I recount an experience of growing up in a home where domestic violence was prevalent. It leaves me with a deeper connection with my mom, but with an unbridled hatred towards my stepfather. This is a mindset that I would carry well into my 30's. This scene sets the stage for a recurring theme throughout the book of not feeling good enough to become all that I was designed to be.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Young Man</strong> - <i>Hood Lessons</i> - In this chapter of the book I develop a shift in thinking that helps me to learn from every situation I face in life. It changes my mindset from victim to being victorious. Hood Lessons examines some of the things that others may take for granted and uses them to create life-changing principles which help me in this season of life. The pain that we face in every situation can be used to push us past our fears and develop a greater sense of self-worth.</li>
<li>
<strong>The New Man</strong> -<i> First Class </i>- In this chapter I talk about overcoming the anxiety of not feeling good enough to be great. I make the decision to change my overall approach to life. Every one of us has or will doubt our ability at some point, but if you know that you are First Class material, then you can eventually change your life for the better.</li>
<li>
<strong>The Redeemed Man</strong> - Just as Job questions God as a result of all the pain he had to endure, I find myself later in life with the opportunity to ask my father questions about why he wasn’t there for me. As our relationship hangs in the balance, tragedy strikes and new hope for redemption begins.</li>

<p>Seventeen-year-old Alvis possesses a gift of inexplicable strength. Raised in the slums by his genius-mechanic father, Alvis wants to use his strength to help people, but his temper gets in him in trouble instead. Level-headed Rae is a half-dragon, half-human hybrid called a Guardian. A wanted criminal, Rae carries with him the trauma from his time as a gladiator, when he was forced to fight against (and kill) other Guardians for the entertainment of the wealthy. Despite their differences, Alvis and Rae can agree on one thing: they fight best when they’re fighting alone. But when faced with the corruption in their homeland, Zen, one thing becomes clear- they'll have to keep each other alive if they want to survive.</p>
<p>THE GUARDIAN is the first installment of a planned trilogy titled WHEN THE LAST DRAGON DIED. For fans of fantasy stories such as <i>Carry On</i> by Rainbow Rowell and anime like <i>Hunter x Hunter</i> and <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>, it tackles themes like mental illness, discrimination, and morality in the face of war with a light-hearted, but earnest tone. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a YA novel without a little romance - Alvis has a thing for guys with strong jawlines and toned biceps. (He also can’t flirt to save his life.)  </p>
<p>The Guardian started as a <a href=""https://nanowrimo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NaNoWriMo</a> project in 2014.  After a few years of fleshing out characters, outlining, and using two more NaNoWriMos as driving forces, I finished the first draft in the Winter of 2017. The next two books have been outlined and writing for book two began in Fall of 2018.</p>
<p>If you would like a sample of The Guardian, the first two chapters are available <a href=""https://www.whenthelastdragondied.com/blank-page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>!<br/> </p>

<p>Self-publishing means I've gone from being solely the author to also being the publisher and advertiser. The Guardian is incredibly important to me and I want to release the best product possible as professionally as I can.

<p>My name is Erin, though I’m known more online as HappiLeeErin! I have a youtube channel dedicated to anime and manga, including a podcast. While my channel has taken a backseat while I’ve worked on my novel project, I’m also very active on twitter where I tweet about white-haired anime boys and the funny stuff my three-year-old says. I love character driven stories that aren't afraid of playing with tropes, and fluff on fluff with a little side of angst when it comes to my romances. While The Guardian is my first novel, I've been writing since I was around 8 years old thanks to some long since buried Dragon Ball Z fanfic (Gohan and Rini are MEANT 2 B DON'T @ ME).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any sort of crowdfunding, there can always be unforeseen difficulties with timeline, shipping, and other things. However, because ""The Guardian"" as a novel is completely written, has gone through numerous beta readers, and is now in the editing phase, I don't foresee any major changes to it and feel confident in my timeline for its release. I also believe I've given myself enough time to order, package, and ship all tier rewards in a timely manner- and I have a husband with an impressive amount of experience when it comes to mail and shipping, so I find any issues with that to be near non-existent. </p>
<p>Of course, I know there is always a chance the project won't be fully funded. If that is the case, the book will <i>not </i>be abandoned. I really believe in my little book baby and I think it would be cool for other people to be excited about it, too. I fully intend to move forward with it next year with our family budget and supporters will still receive their rewards no matter what!</p>

<p>These categories can range from the downright particular (quantum physics, Nicholas Cage memes, piano-playing cats…) to the everyday - and everything in between. </p>

<h2>The Perks?</h2>
<p>Our app is still in development which means that many features can be modified before our worldwide launch. This includes everything from the user interface to the top 12 categories of news featured on the home screen and everything in between (see <strong>Like a Boss</strong> perk).</p>
<p>Anyone who opts in for the “<strong>First in the World</strong>” or “<strong>Pioneer</strong>” perk will be given the opportunity to get early access to the pre­launch versions of Gnow.it. This allows you to give us your feedback on what changes can be made to every aspect of the app. Your valuable input during both alpha and beta testing will lead to a higher quality version of Gnow.it, a version far better than anything our team could accomplish on its own. You can help decide how the app will turn out. Come on, join the team! </p>
<p>The <strong>Boss </strong>and <strong>The Chosen One</strong> perks will get you this exclusive t-shirt design that will ONLY be available to Indiegogo contributors.</p>

<p><strong>1. Will the app be free when it is officially released?  </strong></p>
<p>The app will be free to download when it is completed.</p>
<p><strong>2. In what order of operating systems will the app launch?</strong></p>
<p>The launch of our app will be for both Blackberry and Android. Don’t worry Mac-o-philes, we have a plan to develop for iOS as well.</p>
<p><strong>3. Are there not other apps that have the same personalization features?</strong></p>
<p>There are similar apps that offer personalization but they require manual inputs in order for the app to start recommending articles for you to read. Gnow.it does this automatically without having you to think about it at all.</p>
<p><strong>4. How did you come up with the name?</strong></p>
<p>The core feature of this news reading app is to personalize your reading experience on a mobile device. For an app to offer any form of personalization, it must first get to know you. Based on this premise we decided to give it the name Gnow.it. This is meant to illustrate that the app can learn to ""know"" what content interests you in order to bring you the news that truly matters to you.  Look, we thought we hit the “K” key, but slipped and hit the “G” instead.  We’ve stuck with it because we’re loyal.</p>

</div></div>","What is Gnow.it?

Gnow.it (pronounced “know it”) is a new way to consume digital information that learns your reading interests to deliver the content that truly matters to you. It is a new medium that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to scan all new publications in the world, and curate a set of articles personalized to your interests.
It is the virtual “you” on the internet.  Your digital secretary that is constantly scouring the internet for the freshest content that matches your particular interests.
It brings you all your favourite content from across the web in one place that is easy to read and fun to use. It curates news from a content library spanning thousands of niche categories to find news on any topic you could think of.
 
Features

Personalization Done Right
 

Gnow.it changes the game by learning your preferences and specific interests to create a personalized reading experience. Our artificial intelligence technology will go to work for you to bring you news and blog material to suit your unique tastes. No two individuals will have the same news feed which speaks to the level of personalization made possible by the AI technology that powers this app.
Recommendations Improve Over Time
Within a short period of time of using the app, you will notice that the app can “read your mind” by suggesting articles to read. The app will adapt to your ever-changing interests so that you will always be reading relevant content. Oh, and did we mention that this is all done automatically?
Summaries to Save You Time


Struggling to keep up with all of the news in this fast-paced world of ours? You can read concise summaries of articles to save you time. We know your time is valuable. Our summaries will help you decide if an entire article is worth reading by giving you the main ideas of the content in only a few short sentences.  
News Without Limits

Offers much more than the traditional source listing of most tablet and mobile readers. Find news from any niche on the Internet, no matter how small. Gnow.it brings content from thousands of categories from across the web into the palm of your hand, even from sources that you have never seen before.



*concept image of the app


*concept image

For the Niche. For the Masses. For You
Find news from any niche on the Internet, no matter how small or quirky. Gnow.it offers much more content than the traditional source listing of most tablet and mobile readers. The app will come pre­loaded with common topics such as Politics, Technology, or Business to name a few. Gnow.it will also give you access to thousands of categories for you to choose from. 
These categories can range from the downright particular (quantum physics, Nicholas Cage memes, piano-playing cats…) to the everyday - and everything in between. 
 

 *concept image
Artificial intelligence powered reading
Struggling to keep up with news within this fast paced world? Read summaries to save time. Get your information at a glance without having to read entire articles. Information overload will be a thing of the past. 

We've married content, design and speed.  All three agreed.
No need to worry about loading times anymore to read your news. The app will even work on 2G speeds. Our team has made it a priority to make this app fast and not be bogged down by slow loading images.

*concept image 
Be a good friend - the interesting, smart kind.
Alongside saving your favourite articles you can also share anything interesting you find with your social networks. Don't get unfriended by suggesting stale content ever again*. 
*Gnow.it cannot guarantee that this will never happen to you.
 
         
*concept image 
The Perks?
Our app is still in development which means that many features can be modified before our worldwide launch. This includes everything from the user interface to the top 12 categories of news featured on the home screen and everything in between (see Like a Boss perk).
Anyone who opts in for the “First in the World” or “Pioneer” perk will be given the opportunity to get early access to the pre­launch versions of Gnow.it. This allows you to give us your feedback on what changes can be made to every aspect of the app. Your valuable input during both alpha and beta testing will lead to a higher quality version of Gnow.it, a version far better than anything our team could accomplish on its own. You can help decide how the app will turn out. Come on, join the team! 
The Boss and The Chosen One perks will get you this exclusive t-shirt design that will ONLY be available to Indiegogo contributors.

<h3><em>Hi, friends and fans! </em></h3>

<p>Read on to find out more about the book and this Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<h3>Modogamous: What's the book all about?</h3>
<p><em>Boy meets Girl. Boy and Girl screw it up.</em></p>
<p><em>Girl meets New Boy. Boy meets New Girl.</em></p>
<p><em>New Girl meets New Boy.</em></p>
<p><em>…and then things start to get complicated.</em></p>
<p><em>Relationships, bah! Wouldn’t it just be easier to get a dog?</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">You can read an excerpt from the book <a href=""http://karenemartin.com/blog/books/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Expected publication date is Late Summer 2013!</p>
<h3>Why did I write this the book?</h3>
<p>I love to read, and I love to write. In fact, I write for a living. Most of the time, I write ""work for hire,"" which means someone pays for my writing and then they own the rights to it. That's okay with me - after all, I get to work from home in my pajamas, and I get paid to do something I love. </p>
<p>But over the years, I've probably fielded the question, ""So, when are you going to write your own book?"" about a hundred thousand times. 2012 was the year I decided to tackle that goal, thanks to an unexpected break in my schedule and an insane writing competition, <a href=""http://www.nanowrimo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NaNoWriMo</a>. As for the genre I chose (chicklit), well, I write serious stuff all the time for work, and I just wanted to write something light and fun for a change.</p>
<p>Writing a book has been exciting; it has been exhausting; it has been one helluva ride.</p>
<p>And now I'm in the home stretch - phew!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's the money for?</h3>
<p>Everybody has a hobby or two. My passion for the past nine months has been writing this novel. Like many hobbies, I've sunk some money into my little labor of love (and have a bit more to spend before the publication process is through). So far I've spent about $1,100 on various costs (artwork, cover design, writing software, online and print resources, admin services, etc.), and I expect to spend another $600-800 before the publication process is finished (book formatting for print and digital, more needed design work, and the fees for this Indiegogo campaign, among other things). </p>
<p>That breaks down to just about $2,000. That number doesn't include compensation for the time I spent writing the novel - upwards of 300 hours at this point. (And at minimum wage, that figure would be $2,175!)</p>
<p>Maybe someday I'll make a little money from the book, I dunno, but for now I'd be delighted just to break even. If I don't, though, that's okay. As I said, everybody puts their money into the pursuits that excite them. And it's been a great learning experience, so no matter how things turn out, it's been worth it.</p>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>Well, hopefully, an entertaining read that you'll enjoy when you steal away for a little leisure time in your favorite reading nook! But beyond that, your pledge will:</p>
<ul>
<li>raise money to benefit animals in the Columbus, Ohio area. <span>The mission of the Capital Area Humane Society is to fight animal cruelty, help animals in need and advocate for their well-being.</span>
</li>
<li>help me achieve a goal that's been on my bucket list for a long, long time: writing a novel of my own.</li>
<li>earn you some great perks, from beautiful artwork to the opportunity to name a character in the book after anyone you please ~ including yourself!</li>

<h3><strong>Quick synopsis:</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong><em>Almost 100 years after the Raconii wars, Fear has returned to the Northern Continent. Tetra, a world split in two, is on the brink of war, and everywhere the signs point to the end of life as it is known.</em></p>
<p><em>However, to one man, there is only one crisis happening. Protecting a girl he found lost in the woods with no memory. Filled with action, romance, adventure, and fantastical bounds, this is a tale to enjoy with a cup of tea.</em></p>

<p><span>If you want a small sample, there is one included in the gallery, so please take a look.</span></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>I started writing this story my junior year of high school. That was 6 years ago. It didn't take off till my senior year. For inspiration, I used Tolkien, Chris Bunch, and Lodoss War. The entire reason it isn't finished is partially due to a lazy bug. I lost a lot of what I had written a few years back when I lost my pc, but I resumed writing recently and finished the first half. The second half is what this indiegogo is for. I plan on finishing it and publishing a full fledged book by June. All I need is help. That is where you come in.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Basically this is how it breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li>The larger portion is going towards paying for publishing (including everyone's contribution gift), while the smaller portion is to help pay rent while I write the book.</li>
<li>Perks include free copies of part 1, physical copies of the book (signed!) and what I call Punch the author! (You get to criticize as I write part 2, and tell me things that need fixed in part 1)</li>

</div></div>","Quick synopsis:
Almost 100 years after the Raconii wars, Fear has returned to the Northern Continent. Tetra, a world split in two, is on the brink of war, and everywhere the signs point to the end of life as it is known.
However, to one man, there is only one crisis happening. Protecting a girl he found lost in the woods with no memory. Filled with action, romance, adventure, and fantastical bounds, this is a tale to enjoy with a cup of tea.

Short Summary:
I started writing this story my junior year of high school. That was 6 years ago. It didn't take off till my senior year. For inspiration, I used Tolkien, Chris Bunch, and Lodoss War. The entire reason it isn't finished is partially due to a lazy bug. I lost a lot of what I had written a few years back when I lost my pc, but I resumed writing recently and finished the first half. The second half is what this indiegogo is for. I plan on finishing it and publishing a full fledged book by June. All I need is help. That is where you come in.
What We Need & What You Get


Basically this is how it breaks down:

The larger portion is going towards paying for publishing (including everyone's contribution gift), while the smaller portion is to help pay rent while I write the book.
Perks include free copies of part 1, physical copies of the book (signed!) and what I call Punch the author! (You get to criticize as I write part 2, and tell me things that need fixed in part 1)
If I don't reach the full goal, all funds will be saved until I can afford the publishing, but only Ebooks will be able to be given away. The weekly changes and punch me in the face parts will still apply though. Just ebooks instead of physical copies.

Don't worry about international shipping, I'll cover it by the way. If you feel generous, you can cover it yourself.


If your broke:
Please help spread the word.
 
Stretch goals:
These are simple:
At 3000, EVERYONE who gives more than 10 USD will get a physical copy. Also, this makes part 1 free (because it's only the first half)
At 3500, I will make tshirts for everyone who gives more than 15 USD
At 4000, I will throw a launch party inviting everyone who gives more than 20 USD, where they can pick up their copies of the book as well.
At 5000, well I don't know at that point, but I doubt I'll get that high. If I do, I'll post a youtube video of me doing stupid stuff people ask me to do that contributed. (Oh and everyone who contributes gets a physical copy and t-shirt.)

It comes from my heart! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Enjoy</strong><br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>The idea for the book came from two inspirations.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>One day I was sitting in my living room with my roommate at the time and we were praying and talking. In the middle of our prayer time I started thinking about how every child is a gift from God no matter what the circumstances of their conception or birth were. I happened to open my mouth and say it out loud and as I did, my roommate said that a pastor once told her that because she was conceived out of marriage, she did not have the same covering that her other siblings had, as they were born inside the marriage. Well that sounded just plain stupid to me, so I asked God about it, and again he repeated the idea that Children were HIS idea. And that no child is a mistake or an accident. No child is surprise to him and no matter what the circumstances of their conception, they are wanted.</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>The second thing that made me start thinking about this subject happened was a year of so after. It was christmas time! God knows my love language is gifts, so he asked me one night what I would like for Christmas. I told him that I wanted a story from him as a gift. Something that I could share with people and that it would change the world, and something for children. God instead of giving me a gift in the usual sense started going after a unknown forgtten area of my heart. As I sat by the fire with God, he started to point out areas in my childhood where I told that I was a huge mistake, and that I was not wanted etc. Those phrases again and again came out of my mouth and it hurt deeply. I realized that I had thought most of my life due to circumstances, that I was a mistake, that I was a annoyance and not really wanted. In the midst of this flashback, Father God appeared in the middle of a scene from my childhood where I was being told those very things. Just his mere presence in the midst of the pain showed me that in fact I was not alone in the midst of that and that he did not agree with the way I was being treated.  Again he reiterated that ‘no child was a mistake’, that everyone was planned for and wanted, and that they were all a twinkle in his eye before time began. I started to heal a little as I sat there praying through some of those things that were being shown to me.  As I got to the end, I went into a vision where by Father God told me a story about ""3 little lights"". These three lights had a naming ceremony where by Father God called them out of his heart and named them, prophesying over them, and after he sends them to earth to be born. </h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The story developed from there and it felt like together Father God and I wrote it together as we sat by the fire. While God was healing my heart, he had created a story that would touch others lives too. As I let the truth settle in, the story became part of my little bit of healing and I so wanted other children to know the truth too. I immediately started writing it with God. Within a few hours I had written it all out and had started drawing the artwork out for the book. It was sort of my Christmas present from God! The following Christmas, I got to give it back to him and present him with the gift of a finished book.</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>I feel like this book is extremely important for right now. In a time where abortions are such a prevalent theme, the respect for life and especially a child’s life has not been given as it should be. Children need to know that no matter where they are born, what situation they are born into, or what happens to them in their lives, that they are originally and lovingly Gods idea. They need to know that they are important, and that just because they are small it does not disqualify them in Gods eyes. </h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What if a generation of children were brought up knowing that they are wanted, that they have the confidence to not entertain the negative thoughts that the world bombards them with. What if when a lie that raises it head says “You are a mistake, you are not wanted..” and they respond with Love and cut down the lie immediately and is unshaken by it? What if they can see and understand Father Gods Love for them from an early stage and have a respect for ‘life’ and other children? What if one child grows up with the unshakable knowledge of how much they are loved and that person goes on to change the world?  What if?...</h2>
<h2>There has to be a shift in this world. We cannot carry on and parent or bring up, or teach children the way we have always done. I believe that now is the time to have respect for the life of a child. It is a time to fully grasp the idea that we are all Gods idea, that we are all an answer to prayer in some way or another.</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>I don’t think that children have been given enough respect in this world. If you look back at the way people have parented from the very beginning, there are periods where the world has treated them as second class citizens or even worse, expendable, or even worse then slaves etc. looking through literature like Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and countless others have given us a glimpse at how children are treated in years gone by. Somehow people forget that those little people that are mistreated or hurt, grow up to be adults who can hurt in bigger ways if the cycle is not cut.  “It is easier to grow strong children then to mend a broken man” said Fredrick Douglas, it is gravely true. If we turn our focus on receiving the full Love of the Father, to pour into healthy loved children then I believe the world would be a different place. Bullies would not exist, hatred would lessen, respect and acceptance would be found in everyone’s lives. Orphans would know without a shadow of a doubt, that they are loved and have a father who wants them. And from there they can change the world.</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>This book is dedicated to the little ones who need to know that they are not a mistake, that they are wanted and loved, that they were planned for and foreseen and that they were Gods idea first. That every life is an answer to prayer, that he never holds the circumstances of your conception or birth against you, no matter what man may say or do. And that, as God has respect for free will and life, he respects your life.</h2>

No child is surprise to him and no matter what the circumstances of their conception, they are wanted.
 
 
The second thing that made me start thinking about this subject happened was a year of so after. It was christmas time! God knows my love language is gifts, so he asked me one night what I would like for Christmas. I told him that I wanted a story from him as a gift. Something that I could share with people and that it would change the world, and something for children. God instead of giving me a gift in the usual sense started going after a unknown forgtten area of my heart. As I sat by the fire with God, he started to point out areas in my childhood where I told that I was a huge mistake, and that I was not wanted etc. Those phrases again and again came out of my mouth and it hurt deeply. I realized that I had thought most of my life due to circumstances, that I was a mistake, that I was a annoyance and not really wanted. In the midst of this flashback, Father God appeared in the middle of a scene from my childhood where I was being told those very things. Just his mere presence in the midst of the pain showed me that in fact I was not alone in the midst of that and that he did not agree with the way I was being treated.  Again he reiterated that ‘no child was a mistake’, that everyone was planned for and wanted, and that they were all a twinkle in his eye before time began. I started to heal a little as I sat there praying through some of those things that were being shown to me.  As I got to the end, I went into a vision where by Father God told me a story about ""3 little lights"". These three lights had a naming ceremony where by Father God called them out of his heart and named them, prophesying over them, and after he sends them to earth to be born. 
 
The story developed from there and it felt like together Father God and I wrote it together as we sat by the fire. While God was healing my heart, he had created a story that would touch others lives too. As I let the truth settle in, the story became part of my little bit of healing and I so wanted other children to know the truth too. I immediately started writing it with God. Within a few hours I had written it all out and had started drawing the artwork out for the book. It was sort of my Christmas present from God! The following Christmas, I got to give it back to him and present him with the gift of a finished book.
 
I feel like this book is extremely important for right now. In a time where abortions are such a prevalent theme, the respect for life and especially a child’s life has not been given as it should be. Children need to know that no matter where they are born, what situation they are born into, or what happens to them in their lives, that they are originally and lovingly Gods idea. They need to know that they are important, and that just because they are small it does not disqualify them in Gods eyes. 
 
What if a generation of children were brought up knowing that they are wanted, that they have the confidence to not entertain the negative thoughts that the world bombards them with. What if when a lie that raises it head says “You are a mistake, you are not wanted..” and they respond with Love and cut down the lie immediately and is unshaken by it? What if they can see and understand Father Gods Love for them from an early stage and have a respect for ‘life’ and other children? What if one child grows up with the unshakable knowledge of how much they are loved and that person goes on to change the world?  What if?...
There has to be a shift in this world. We cannot carry on and parent or bring up, or teach children the way we have always done. I believe that now is the time to have respect for the life of a child. It is a time to fully grasp the idea that we are all Gods idea, that we are all an answer to prayer in some way or another.
 
I don’t think that children have been given enough respect in this world. If you look back at the way people have parented from the very beginning, there are periods where the world has treated them as second class citizens or even worse, expendable, or even worse then slaves etc. looking through literature like Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and countless others have given us a glimpse at how children are treated in years gone by. Somehow people forget that those little people that are mistreated or hurt, grow up to be adults who can hurt in bigger ways if the cycle is not cut.  “It is easier to grow strong children then to mend a broken man” said Fredrick Douglas, it is gravely true. If we turn our focus on receiving the full Love of the Father, to pour into healthy loved children then I believe the world would be a different place. Bullies would not exist, hatred would lessen, respect and acceptance would be found in everyone’s lives. Orphans would know without a shadow of a doubt, that they are loved and have a father who wants them. And from there they can change the world.
 
This book is dedicated to the little ones who need to know that they are not a mistake, that they are wanted and loved, that they were planned for and foreseen and that they were Gods idea first. That every life is an answer to prayer, that he never holds the circumstances of your conception or birth against you, no matter what man may say or do. And that, as God has respect for free will and life, he respects your life.

The Earth has teeth,And it eats us all in time.
Almost two decades have passed since Raven Shilling witnessed the brutal abduction of her parents – not with her eyes, but with her ears.
Years of therapy couldn’t erase the hair-raising howls that invade her dreams on a nightly basis.
Now in her 20’s, Raven returns to the site of her parents’ disappearance - not to search for the bodies that were never found, but to film a low-budget, Hollywood horror movie in the remote hills above Wolf Woods, British Columbia.
Soon after shooting begins, one of the actors is found torn to pieces in the back alley of a seedy hotel. The townsfolk are quick to pass it off as a random bear attack. But that doesn't explain the naked girl seen running away from the body.
The locals are covering up a sinister truth. Raven is certain of it. She can feel it… literally. Her senses have never been so alive… so primal. It’s as though her soul is drawn to this place. And the howls in her mind are sounding more and more like voices… calling to her.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Occidental slam team is a group of five students that qualified for the Oxy slam team in Nov. 2012, and who have been training to perform and compete at the College Unions Poetry Slam Invitational (CUPSI) in April. The competition is an annual one that invites college students from all over the country to connect, write, and perform poetry with each other; this year, Barnard College in New York is hosting the competition, and we need to raise money so that we can be a part of this <strong>amazing</strong> event!</p>
<p>""What's a slam?"", you say? A poetry slam is a competitive poetry competition started in the 80s by March ""So What"" Smith in Chicago. At poetry slams, poets get up in front of an audience, perform their original 3-minute-long poems without the help of props or music, and get scored Olympic-style (on a scale of 1 to 10) by five judges, who are usually randomly selected from the audience. The audience is encouraged to respond, and slams often end up being a magical combination of church and comedy club, where poets share intimate secrets and stories that help individuals come together and connect as a community. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Between the costs of airfare and lodging, our five poets (plus our amazing student coach) will need to raise about $2,000 in total. You can help!</p>
<p>A $5 donation gets you a candy gram to you or the sweetheart of your choice with an original haiku attached. (We can mail these if you're long-distance!)</p>
<p>A $10 donation gets you a hard copy of an Oxy poem performed at CUPSI, plus a signed picture of the team.</p>
<p>A $50 donation gets you a hard copy of an Oxy poem, a program from CUPSI 2013, plus a signed picture of the team.</p>
<p>A $100 donation gets you a souvenir from NYC, a hard copy of an Oxy poem, a program from CUPSI 2013, plus a signed picture of the team.</p>
<p>A $200 donation gets you an original group poem written in your honor (with a hard copy and recorded version), a souvenir from NYC, a hard copy of an Oxy poem, a program from CUPSI 2013, plus a signed picture of the team.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>CUPSI is an amazing, life-changing experience and if we go, we will be improved as artists and as human beings. In addition, we will be able to take critical concepts that we learn there (about social justice, identity, and community) and bring it back to the Oxy campus, thus benefitting all students that attend our school.</p>
<p>Last year, we beat teams such as Harvard and Dartmouth -- help us prove our mettle again this year!</p>

A $50 donation gets you a hard copy of an Oxy poem, a program from CUPSI 2013, plus a signed picture of the team.
A $100 donation gets you a souvenir from NYC, a hard copy of an Oxy poem, a program from CUPSI 2013, plus a signed picture of the team.
A $200 donation gets you an original group poem written in your honor (with a hard copy and recorded version), a souvenir from NYC, a hard copy of an Oxy poem, a program from CUPSI 2013, plus a signed picture of the team.


The Impact
CUPSI is an amazing, life-changing experience and if we go, we will be improved as artists and as human beings. In addition, we will be able to take critical concepts that we learn there (about social justice, identity, and community) and bring it back to the Oxy campus, thus benefitting all students that attend our school.
Last year, we beat teams such as Harvard and Dartmouth -- help us prove our mettle again this year!

<p>As a kid, I was given a globe, and I was fascinated by it.

Or weird places <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifni"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">like Ifni</a>, which was on my globe and existed for only 11 years as a separate province.</p>
<p>For years, I traveled for business only, and I was able to travel to several continents.

So many things to see. <em>Learn how to reduce the possibilities to a manageable list, then how to plan your trips.</em></p>
<p>Then, earlier this year, I had a once-in-a-lifetime trip planned. Eight days before I was due to leave, I had a wrench thrown in my plans and had to either a) scrap the trip entirely, b) have it suddenly cost thousands of unplanned dollars more; or c) change my trip so fundamentally that it no longer resembled what I originally planned. <em>Learn coping strategies for adversity.</em></p>
<p>It’s a big world. <em>Let me help you get out there.</em></p>
<h3>My Background</h3>
<p>While I’ve primarily been a software engineer most of my life, most recently at Apple, I’ve also worked in the travel industry.</p>
<p>For (now defunct, but not my fault) Eastern Airlines, I was a reservationist with the group booking desk, planning trips for the Caribbean and northern South America. <a href=""http://www.virtualeastern.com/images/routemap3-2-87.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can see an old Eastern Airlines route map here.</a></p>
<p>I’ve also worked in several capacities on several cruise lines, mostly Premier Cruise Lines (also now defunct, but also not my fault), from purser to medical records consultant to computer consultant–also mostly in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>More recently, I worked in reservations at (the still existing, yay) <a href=""http://www.classicvacations.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Classic Vacations</a>, the luxury division of Expedia. Like everyone, I started on the Hawaii desk, booking custom air-and-hotel packages for travel agents’ clients.

<p>Beyond the art and craft of the poetry, <i>A Good Hammer</i> will truly be a limited edition, signed and numbered,

<p>From Kathleen Driskell, associate director Spalding University MFA in Writing program, associate editor of <em>The Louisville Review</em>, and author of the national bestseller <em>Seed Across Snow: Poems</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Albert DeGenova’s new poetry in <em>A Good Hammer</em> is full of musical moments that leap from the page, calling us to consider the complicated whole of a man’s life. Exploring “fatherblood,” “divorce’s rough cut hole,” and the many lessons a man might learn from his growing sons, this collection unfolds like a fugue, interweaving poems that are honest and accomplished, strains that lament, soothe, and rejoice. <em>A Good Hammer</em> reminds the reader that though a modern-day family might inhabit many households, its ties are never fully unraveled.</p></blockquote>
<br/>
</div>From Ralph Hamilton, poet and editor of <i>RHINO</i> magazine:<p><br/></p><p><i></i></p><blockquote>
<i>Perhaps it’s in “pockets stuffed / with brown paper bags that / smell of Swiss cheese / and peanut butter and limp garlic pickles.”  Perhaps in the cool moonglow touch of each finger on a saxophone’s keys, or three young women in black bikinis riding bikes in the rain, or in the “baby finding her toes.”Or maybe in “splinters, the little / cuts that never bleed.”  Even, the simple wine-rich romance of how “she washed my back, / I combed her hair.”  Whatever, wherever, the transcendental catalyst that makes a book of poems come fully alive—take breath, aching, literally begin pulsing on the page, grow more vital, more necessary with each poem—Albert DeGenova’s </i>A Good Hammer<i> has it in spades. Skillfully crafted and deeply humane, </i>Hammer<i> celebrates the lasting, sonorous bond between fathers and sons, husbands and wives, the power of families, the simple joys of ordinary life, of music and dance; but also the fact of failure, of loss, of disease, divorce, the need for forgiveness, the sad fortunate gift of what the Portuguese sumptuously call saudade (and we, meagerly, longing). For DeGenova love is corporeal.  And it lives at the center of this moving collection: not love as easy sentiment, but as blood and gossamer air, as beat and beauty, as hunger and bliss. DeGenova finds this link even in long forgotten words written on a yellowed cocktail napkin discovered “inside his father’s black fisherman’s cap – / a jagged sweat line, dry salt; a wiry / white hair caught / in a seam…”It’s no wonder the collection begins with a quote from Basho, the Japanese master of the brief, brilliant, firefly moment.Like its namesake poem, </i>A Good Hammer<i> delights in the living legacy of everything that binds us to each other and to the world, the one true thing, finally, “you can hold in [your] hand.”<blockquote></blockquote></i><p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Since Timberline Press was founded in 1975 by Clarence Wolfshohl, authors and readers had come to depend on Clarence and the press to produce beautiful books at reasonable prices. When Clarence announced that the press would cease operation at the end of 2010, the Virtual Artists Collective put its collective heads together to think about how to keep it alive — with the same commitment to beautiful books at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Now the fine press imprint of the Virtual Artists Collective, Timberline continues under the master efforts of Regina Schroeder to produce hand made books in the long tradition of its founder — beautiful books of fine poetry that readers can afford.</p>
<p>During his thirty-five years running Timberline, Wolfshohl developed his craft of letterpress printing. Although he was willing to use other processes if justified by the book’s need, his original economic decision to use letterpress became an aesthetic one. The full involvement of our senses with a well-crafted letterpress book became his goal equal to the presentation of well-crafted and sincere poetry. <b>It is this attention to the literary art and book-making craft that Timberline Press continues into the future.</b><br/></p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p> <i>WHO AM I?</i></p><p><i>I'm an older Aussie - 57 this July! I have variously and simultaneously: raised two children (I do love my children!), educated other children as a primary teacher, renovated, run a business (boarding cattery - I do love cats!), and cared for wildlife and lost felines. But one love which has mainly resided within hope and been neglected within drawers, has been my writing. Until recently, at least. </i></p><p><i>WHAT IS MY PROJECT?</i></p><p><i>In 2010 I began in earnest to bring a dream into reality - the dream to live and support myself as an author. At first I wrote and illustrated two picture books, self-publishing in the Spring of 2012. What a learning curve! But those two books are 'out there' - in homes, schools and libraries and hopefully too, in the hearts of all who've read them. <br/></i></p><p><i>In December 2012, I began the writing of the book for which I now need your help - my first novel . A young adult coming of age fantasy, it made an ebook debut in September 2013, on Amazon, under the title Heart of Esor. <br/></i></p><p><i>The positive response and feedback I received , especially from female readers (t'weens, teens and adults alike), prompted a greater commitment towards this novel's future. It had touched the hearts and souls of readers and needed to be out there, in the big world, being noticed, being read.</i></p><p><i>Since then I have spent every spare moment and every spare cent giving this beautiful story a thorough make-over. It's had an editing tidy up, has a new professional cover by amazing fantasy artist Laura Diehl, has been professionally formatted for the printers and has a refreshed title - it's now simply, ESOR. <br/></i></p><p><i>And though ESOR will be available in more ebook formats very soon, ESOR also needs to experience print. For this novel houses a quaint, almost old-fashioned story, whose true soul lies in  print. Just like Pinocchio wanted to become a real boy, ESOR wants to become a real book.  </i></p><p><i>HOW YOU CAN HELP<br/></i></p><p><i>I'm just $2500 short of this goal and am relying on a short term loan to fund the final stages until  public support arrives. And this is where I need and appreciate your help and support. ESOR needs and appreciates your help and support also. It needs to become printed and so  join the other real books, tempting and tantalising, in the real world.</i></p><p><i>Please make a donation - (even $1 from you would make a difference!) or pre-order your copy of ESOR. Check out the perks - I've kept it simple and straightforward, because what I really want is for you to read and  experience this story. </i></p><p><i>The book will be available, by hook or by crook, from the southern Winter Solstice, so 21 June, 2014. Even if all funds aren't raised, one way or another this will go ahead. All books pre-ordered will be posted  within 48 hours of that date.<br/></i></p><p><i>I hope you'll feel positive about contributing, but if you decide otherwise, please share this information with others. Do you have a niece, friend, child or grandchild, who might enjoy it? Do you know a school or library which would appreciate a beautiful addition to their collection?   </i></p><p><i>Thank you for your time and interest in my project.</i></p><p><i>(Please note that this book is to be printed in Australia by an Australian company with a sustainability policy. The internal design was also done in Australia by an Australian company. So Aussie employment has been supported! The cover was by a US artist , so all you Americans out there, please get behind her beautiful work.)</i></p><p><i><b>Here's a link to some front pages and two chapters of the book .</b><br/></i></p><p><i><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5115byTKeuSV1Q5TnVNRVlsNjQ/edit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5115byTKeuSV1Q5TnVNRVlsNjQ/edit</a><br/></i></p><p>Short Summary</p><p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust.

I have variously and simultaneously: raised two children (I do love my children!), educated other children as a primary teacher, renovated, run a business (boarding cattery - I do love cats!), and cared for wildlife and lost felines. But one love which has mainly resided within hope and been neglected within drawers, has been my writing. Until recently, at least. WHAT IS MY PROJECT?In 2010 I began in earnest to bring a dream into reality - the dream to live and support myself as an author. At first I wrote and illustrated two picture books, self-publishing in the Spring of 2012. What a learning curve! But those two books are 'out there' - in homes, schools and libraries and hopefully too, in the hearts of all who've read them. In December 2012, I began the writing of the book for which I now need your help - my first novel . A young adult coming of age fantasy, it made an ebook debut in September 2013, on Amazon, under the title Heart of Esor. The positive response and feedback I received , especially from female readers (t'weens, teens and adults alike), prompted a greater commitment towards this novel's future. It had touched the hearts and souls of readers and needed to be out there, in the big world, being noticed, being read.Since then I have spent every spare moment and every spare cent giving this beautiful story a thorough make-over. It's had an editing tidy up, has a new professional cover by amazing fantasy artist Laura Diehl, has been professionally formatted for the printers and has a refreshed title - it's now simply, ESOR. And though ESOR will be available in more ebook formats very soon, ESOR also needs to experience print. For this novel houses a quaint, almost old-fashioned story, whose true soul lies in  print. Just like Pinocchio wanted to become a real boy, ESOR wants to become a real book.  HOW YOU CAN HELPI'm just $2500 short of this goal and am relying on a short term loan to fund the final stages until  public support arrives. And this is where I need and appreciate your help and support. ESOR needs and appreciates your help and support also. It needs to become printed and so  join the other real books, tempting and tantalising, in the real world.Please make a donation - (even $1 from you would make a difference!) or pre-order your copy of ESOR. Check out the perks - I've kept it simple and straightforward, because what I really want is for you to read and  experience this story. The book will be available, by hook or by crook, from the southern Winter Solstice, so 21 June, 2014. Even if all funds aren't raised, one way or another this will go ahead. All books pre-ordered will be posted  within 48 hours of that date.I hope you'll feel positive about contributing, but if you decide otherwise, please share this information with others. Do you have a niece, friend, child or grandchild, who might enjoy it? Do you know a school or library which would appreciate a beautiful addition to their collection?   Thank you for your time and interest in my project.(Please note that this book is to be printed in Australia by an Australian company with a sustainability policy. The internal design was also done in Australia by an Australian company. So Aussie employment has been supported! The cover was by a US artist , so all you Americans out there, please get behind her beautiful work.)Here's a link to some front pages and two chapters of the book .https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5115byTKeuSV1Q5TnVNRVlsNjQ/editShort SummaryContributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust.

close; she passed away on the 24<sup>th</sup> of February 2013  and I have been wondering how to keep the

to imprint her names forever in the pages of my book <i>Changing Hearts</i>.<p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p><b>About The Book</b></p>
<p><i>Changing Hearts</i> is the traumatic story
of a young child diagnosed of life threatening heart disease and the riveting
court case to determine if she lived or died.<br/></p><p>It us the story of little Wendy; she lives with her mother Gina in a derelict Harlem
apartment; her father Richard Jones had abandoned them and eloped with another
woman. Wendy became terribly ill and all effort at treatment was unsuccessful.
Advanced medical tests soon revealed she had life threatening medical
condition described as cardiomyopathy; her heart was failing her. Wendy would need to undergo an organ
transplant if she must live. She is  put in the UNOS list; a waiting list of patients in need of
organ. For Wendy however, getting a matching heart that fits in her
pericardial cavity proved was proving a formidable task.<br/></p>
<p>At this time, however Richard Jones would return to his family after
his woman friend left him for a younger partner; he found his family in distressing conditions. Remorseful, heavy with guilt and desperate to correct the past wrongs he
offers to swap organs with his dying child.</p>
<p>It was the greatest gift any parent could have given to a
loving child. </p>
<p>But the team of organ transplant specialists declined to
carry out the surgery citing unprofessional, suicidal and unethical grounds. According
to one of the specialists, “<i>this is a
prodigious medical experiment that could go awfully wrong. When that happens </i><i>we will, every one of us present in this room, be dragged to court for unprofessional medical practice; at the end  we will either have our licenses revoked or suspended.</i>” </p>
<p>More desperate than ever, knowing his daughter had but a
short time to live Richard solicits the services of Susan Spencer, a brilliant
but reluctant Childs Rights Advocate and together they dragged the transplant
Team and the state of New York to court.</p><p> It marked the beginning of a riveting
case that would ultimately determine the fate of a dying child.</p><p> <span>For Susan, though,  this was no doubt  her most trying case ever. The man from the DA 's office 
whose job was to ensure the case is struck out was her lover and the man she hoped to marry; a man with a king-size grudge. Now Susan 
must choose between saving a crumbling relationship or the life of a dying helpless child</span>. <br/></p><p>For little Wendy the time ticked
away quickly; too quickly. </p>
<p>Would she get the organ she so desperately needed before her
heart finally fails her? <br/></p><p>The climax will shock you!<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/341598/files/20140131141232-Changing_Hearts_sponsors.jpg?1391206352"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>

<p><b>Why publishing <i>Changing Hearts</i>
will make a world of difference</b></p>
<p>I started work on the book changing hearts 2009 but had to
abandon writing severally because I figured landing an agent would be formidable
considering the high rate of manuscripts rejection in the industry. It was my beloved wife who
encouraged me to continue with the work because the plot fascinated her; she
told me she had faith in me and had confidence that if given opportunity <i>Changing Hearts</i> would do well.</p>
<p>It is ironical and tortuous that the book she helped
nurtured would be coming out after she was gone. It makes me bleed at heart.</p>
<p>Please kindly help me as I plan to dedicate this awesome
writing to her loving memory and to other women who are going through trying
time trying or hoping to conceive. My heart also goes out to pregnant and
nursing women; this is telling you that you are all appreciated. It is the
toughest period of a woman’s life, especially when standard medical care is
sorely lacking or just too expensive and out of reach of the poor. I have been
there, so I should know. </p>
<p>I have such great perks for you as you join to help make

 In my next book, I want to tackle a whole host of medical issues that stem from mitochondrial dysfunction. Heart disease, diabetes, chronic fatigue, and poor performance can all be linked to mitochondrial dysfunction.So what are mitochondria?""A Mitochondrion is a membrane-enclosed organelle structure found in all 
cells in the human body. These mitochondria are known as the “power 
plants” of the cell. The mitochondria of the cell generate the most of the
 cell’s supply of adenosine triphosphate, which is used by the cell as a
 source of chemical energy. ""Do you not have enough energy to get through the day?Mitochondria produce the energy that we need to get through our everyday hectic life.Mitochondria are even responsible for more actions in the body including cellular signalling, cellular differentiation, and cellular death.Are you tired of you skin and joints aging rapidly?There even is a Theory of Mitochondrial Aging, meaning that the health of our mitochondria is directly linked to how fast we age!This book will change how we tackle chronic diseases /conditions including heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer disease, and stroke. Is it possible to grow new brain and heart cells in our body, by increasing mitochondrial function, after the damage from these diseases have been done?In the fast paced world we live in; we need all the energy we can produce to keep up with the hectic pace of life! This constant need for increased energy is what my book Fix Your Mitochondria will address, how proper mitochondrial function equals enough energy to get you through the day!What do you receive for donating?The offered perks range from receiving my books, Fix Your Gut, or the Fix Your Gut Probiotic Guide, to receiving e-mail coaching or skype coaching by me. Over the past few years, I have been able to help many people through coaching them and providing information for free on forums and my website Fixyourgut.com.The Fix Your Gut Supplement Guide is finally completed and will be offered as a perk for your donations as well. The supplement guide 
covers vitamins, minerals, brands, updated multivitamin recommendations,
 hypervitamin / mineralosis, what is the best place to purchase your supplements, in-depth omega 3 
information, supplement regimens on a budget, and supplement information
 of what should be in anyone's medicine cabinet.What is the money raised  going to?The money raised during this fundraiser will help me pay some bills so I can make a small living during the research and writing of this book. I also need to purchase sources and materials for the research of the book. I will also need to pay for an editor for the book and a graphic designer.

<h3>Vagina Matters, a sex ed book for girls</h3>
<p>Hi! We are <a href=""https://fineacts.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fine Acts</a>, a playground for social change.</p>
<p><a href=""http://vaginamatters.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vagina Matters</a> is our illustrated book project dedicated to bringing sexual health education to girls and women – in Bulgaria, and beyond.</p>
<p>The female body, menstruation and sex continue to be taboo topics in many countries, which makes it extremely difficult to have open conversations about sexual health issues that affect our physical, mental and social well-being. While both girls and boys receive poor sexual health education (only 10% of schools in Bulgaria have dedicated classes according to a statement by the Bulgarian Ombudsman), we’ve found that girls are disproportionately affected. Bulgaria, along with Romania, has the highest rate of teenage pregnancies in the EU (<a href=""https://gateway.euro.who.int/en/indicators/hfa_592-7040-of-all-live-births-to-mothers-aged-under-20-years/visualizations/#id=19687"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WHO</a>, <a href=""https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.ADO.TFRT?view=map"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UNDP</a>).</p>
<p>We are set on encouraging a culture of curiosity and openness about sexual health issues that are crucial to growing up and understanding ourselves.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558940276/mbkkmi4saiwavjqikzlx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After successfully publishing the book in Bulgaria, we plan to take the initiative further on a more global scale, and target other countries lacking a working sexual health education curriculum. The first step in this direction would be to translate the book in English, to make it widely available to anyone wishing to collaborate!</p>
<p>Our Vagina Matters team is passionate about bringing the book to life. We believe in compassionate and comprehensive sexual health education where girls not only learn about the negative issues such as unwanted pregnancies and STI’s, but really get to know their body and how it functions. By supporting our campaign, you join us in empowering girls, which begins with adequate education on sexual health and relationships.  </p>

<p>The authors of the book are:</p>
<ul><li>Svetla Baeva and Raya Raeva are human rights activists. Svetla is the Campaigns Director at <a href=""http://www.fineacts.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fine Acts</a>, a global platform for socially engaged creative solutions, while Raya is the acting Campaigns Director at the <a href=""http://www.bghelsinki.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bulgarian Helsinki Committee</a>, the leading human rights organization in Bulgaria. We’ve been championing women’s rights for years and have worked on a number of campaigns and initiatives concerning violence against women, women’s rights history in Bulgaria, including how women are portrayed in public spaces and literature, lack of representation of women artists in galleries and museums, etc.</li></ul>
<p>We started our research over a year ago and today we have more educational content than we could’ve hoped for, exploring issues such as the female body, menstruation and sex, as well as issues of equality, stereotypes, and violence. To make Vagina Matters appealing and engaging, we reached out to two talented illustrators:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558988493/qjlle7buibeowbmxeaco.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

They’re into illustration, storyboarding and design. Borislava gets her inspiration from the world around her, that’s why she loves to travel, capturing every moment with pen and paper. Mihaela is inspired by music notes, the wilderness, skateboarding, the circus, and fashion.<br/> </li></ul>

<p><br/>We’ve also engaged a number of experts in the field like medical and sex ed professionals, midwives, lawyers and many more, who have certified our content. During this period, we’ve worked hard to onboard a number of partners such as <a href=""https://loveguide.bg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Loveguide.bg</a>, the largest online platform for sexual education, and the <a href=""http://www.bghelsinki.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bulgarian Helsinki Committee</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The project has so far been backed by the <a href=""https://bgfundforwomen.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bulgarian Fund for Women</a>, a grant-making organization working to achieve gender equality in all spheres of public life, with an initial grant (EUR 1000) that has helped us carry out our research, pilot the first illustrations and launch our website.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Making a big, beautiful book requires a lot of funding. Paper costs go up every year, and we want to work only with dedicated printing shops. It's made in Bulgaria so that we can oversee every step of production.</p>
<p>The book will be a full-color, softcover edition, sized at 15 x 21 cm and over 200 pages long!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558989400/bzum1jdsrxqch0knqs6o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><br/>But we still have much to do. <strong>We’ll need a total of USD 6000 to finance the remaining production phases:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>edit and review the book content;</li>
<li>complete all illustrations (over 150 of them!);</li>
<li>print 2000 copies of the book;</li>
<li>disseminate 1500 books for free within disadvantaged groups in schools across the country;</li>
<li>sell 500 book copies so that we can support further printing and dissemination of the book;</li>
<li>publish a free version of Vagina Matters on our website so that anyone wishing to access the information can do so;</li>
<li>organize an exhibition with the book illustrations on October 11, International Girl’s Day.</li>
</ul>
<p>By supporting us, you will help us grow our community, who wants to see real changes. Nearly 78% of people, aged 15 to 49, are certain that students should be taught sexual health in school (<a href=""https://loveguide.bg/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/loveguide.bg-Sexual-Health.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Loveguide.bg</a>).</p>

<li>500 USD – you gift ten books (and you get one).<br/> </li>
</ul>

<h3>What we hope to achieve</h3>
<p>Vagina Matters responds to an existing gap in sexual health education. It creates engaging and accessible information for girls. It’s essentially a pocket guidebook with the answers to all the burning questions that girls might have about the female body, menstruation, sex and more.</p>
<p>We plan to freely distribute our book in schools and local workshops on sexual health education organized across the country. With the support of our partners such as Loveguide.bg and the Bulgarian Fund for Women’s network, we will be able to directly reach our target group: young girls between the ages of 14 and 19.</p>
<p>Due to the existing taboo around speaking about the female body, menstruation and sex, the book is just as relevant for women in their twenties or thirties. We also plan to sell our book online for anyone who wants to get a print edition. We know there’s interest because we’ve already been featured in the news in publications such as <a href=""http://www.cosmopolitan.bg/seksualno-zdrave/kazva-se-vagina-ti-poznavash-li-dobre-tialoto-si.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cosmopolitan</a> and <a href=""https://vijmag.bg/review/poznavame-telata"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vij Magazine</a> (print and online) even before we launched our campaign! All funds from sold copies will support our book distribution on the ground.</p>
<p>We believe in access – the more people who can read Vagina Matters, the more we can change damaging myths and stereotypes. This is why we will also make a version of the book available online for anyone to download and read!</p>
<p>We’re bursting with ideas on how to spread the word! One of them is to translate Vagina Matters in English – we know that compassionate materials on sexual health, that are also well-designed, are lacking across Eastern Europe and beyond. If we can translate it, we will be able to reach more girls regarding their sexual health and relationships. That’s why we’ve enabled Indiegogo’s Indemand option for campaigning, which means that we’ll be accepting contributions after our campaign ends.</p>
<p>Our team is experienced in producing children’s books and products. We’ve just launched a children’s comic book, <a href=""https://fineacts.co/narwhal-party"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Party for the Narwhal</a>, with quirky illustrations that draw out the story of a narwhal seeking asylum from the pollution that has destroyed his home in the Arctic waters. Not only that, last year we launched an educational pack of illustrated coloring cards called <a href=""https://www.dnevnik.bg/bulgaria/2018/10/25/3333492_superjenite_za_ocvetiavane/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The superwomen</a>, with stories of women historical figures.</p>
<p>We’ve also produced a number of projects, championing women’s rights, such as <a href=""https://fineacts.co/beat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BEAT.</a>, a campaign featuring an art installation and a video, tackling the silence around domestic violence, or the <a href=""https://fineacts.co/monument-number-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MONUMENT #1</a> action that supported the Monumental Women campaign in Bulgaria about women’s rights history, which also called for more female statues across Sofia.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the risks is that we won’t be able to raise enough funds to produce the book. That’s why apart from our crowdfunding campaign, we’re working hard to diversify our funding sources by reaching out to grant-making organizations and companies that are aligned with our values.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It's time for the Indian side of the story to finally be told about America's first named Indian war — The Tiguex War (pronounced TEE-wesh). So far, it's the least known, with only a few eyewitness Spanish chroniclers having written about it 470-plus years ago. And all of them told the story from the sixteenth-century conquistador point of view.</p>
<p><em>Winter of the Metal People: The untold story of America's first Indian war </em>tells at last the Indian side of the story. You can find more information about the book at my author's <a href=""http://dennisherrick.com/winter-of-the-metal-people-historic-novel-coronado-indian-war"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> and on the book's <a href=""http://tiguexwar.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a>.</p>
<p>This historical novel tells how a young Pueblo warrior named Poquis reluctantly accepts leadership after Spaniards and their Aztec allies inflict major defeats on his tribe in 1540-41 in the Southwest. When all seems lost, he resorts to guerilla warfare to better fight the invaders. Unlike most Indian wars to follow, the Natives win this time. The Spaniards withdraw from the Southwest and do not return for half a century.</p>
<p>Sorry, no video, but click <a href=""http://www.rrobserver.com/news/local/article_2a6b4cbe-882f-11e2-9e84-001a4bcf887a.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Winter of the Metal People"">here</a> for a newspaper article about the book.</p>
<h3>After publication, it's all about marketing</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most difficult job in the crowded book market is figuring out how to let people even realize a book exists.</p>
<p>A prestigious small, independent press has signed a contract to publish <em>Winter of the Metal People</em> early in 2013. Because the publisher is small, however, it will be mostly up to me to publicize and promote the book so people can learn the Native side of the story.</p>
<p>Your support of this Indiegogo project will raise the funds necessary to finance the perks listed on the right and successfully market both e-book and print editions of <em>Winter of the Metal People</em><em>.</em> Your pledges will pay advertising and marketing costs as well as commission a Puebloan artist for the cover. (I have an artist already committed.) Your pledges will also provide copies I'll donate to school libraries in each of New Mexico's 20 pueblos so their students can learn more of their own proud history. </p>
<div>
<p>Funds will go to complement social marketing with expenses such as advertising, a book tour, public relations, and promotional items such as bookmarks, fliers, review copies, promotional copies, etc. </p>
</div>
<p>Join me in giving voice to the early Pueblo Indians who have been portrayed by only the conquistadors' most negative stereotypes since 1540. Any funding will go to distribute and promote the book to the largest possible audience. If we go over our goal, I can provide extra benefits for all backers.</p>
<p>For a book sample, download a free pdf of <a href=""http://dennisherrick.com/downloads/sample_chapter.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chapter 6.</a> A link to the historical notes is on the book's complementary <a href=""http://dennisherrick.com/winter-of-the-metal-people-historic-novel-coronado-indian-war"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> so you can compare the Chapter 6 notes with the chapter.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>About the author and book</h3>
<p>I'm the author of several published short stories and two novels that you can see on my author website at <a href=""http://dennisherrick.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""dennisherrick.com"">dennisherrick.com</a>. I have been researching, writing, and rewriting <em>Winter of the Metal People</em> for the last 10 years.</p>
<p>I did have<em> Winter of the Metal People</em> under contract two years ago, but that publisher entered bankruptcy during the recession and released all rights back to me. Different publishers have offered contracts over the past two years, but I feel the publisher I ultimately accepted will do the best job for the book. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
It's time for the Indian side of the story to finally be told about America's first named Indian war — The Tiguex War (pronounced TEE-wesh). So far, it's the least known, with only a few eyewitness Spanish chroniclers having written about it 470-plus years ago. And all of them told the story from the sixteenth-century conquistador point of view.
Winter of the Metal People: The untold story of America's first Indian war tells at last the Indian side of the story. You can find more information about the book at my author's website and on the book's blog.
This historical novel tells how a young Pueblo warrior named Poquis reluctantly accepts leadership after Spaniards and their Aztec allies inflict major defeats on his tribe in 1540-41 in the Southwest. When all seems lost, he resorts to guerilla warfare to better fight the invaders. Unlike most Indian wars to follow, the Natives win this time. The Spaniards withdraw from the Southwest and do not return for half a century.
Sorry, no video, but click here for a newspaper article about the book.
After publication, it's all about marketing
Perhaps the most difficult job in the crowded book market is figuring out how to let people even realize a book exists.
A prestigious small, independent press has signed a contract to publish Winter of the Metal People early in 2013. Because the publisher is small, however, it will be mostly up to me to publicize and promote the book so people can learn the Native side of the story.
Your support of this Indiegogo project will raise the funds necessary to finance the perks listed on the right and successfully market both e-book and print editions of Winter of the Metal People. Your pledges will pay advertising and marketing costs as well as commission a Puebloan artist for the cover. (I have an artist already committed.) Your pledges will also provide copies I'll donate to school libraries in each of New Mexico's 20 pueblos so their students can learn more of their own proud history. 

Funds will go to complement social marketing with expenses such as advertising, a book tour, public relations, and promotional items such as bookmarks, fliers, review copies, promotional copies, etc. 

Join me in giving voice to the early Pueblo Indians who have been portrayed by only the conquistadors' most negative stereotypes since 1540. Any funding will go to distribute and promote the book to the largest possible audience. If we go over our goal, I can provide extra benefits for all backers.
For a book sample, download a free pdf of Chapter 6. A link to the historical notes is on the book's complementary website so you can compare the Chapter 6 notes with the chapter.


About the author and book
I'm the author of several published short stories and two novels that you can see on my author website at dennisherrick.com. I have been researching, writing, and rewriting Winter of the Metal People for the last 10 years.
I did have Winter of the Metal People under contract two years ago, but that publisher entered bankruptcy during the recession and released all rights back to me. Different publishers have offered contracts over the past two years, but I feel the publisher I ultimately accepted will do the best job for the book. 
The Impact


The novel is complete at 86,000 words and includes a map. In addition to historical background notes already posted on the book's complementary website, a special section on today's surviving Tiguex Province pueblos also will be posted there. The conquistadors are gone, but the Puebloans are still here — as tourists can attest who fall in love with Puebloan art, architecture, and dance ceremonies when they visit the Southwest. 
Three unique aspects about this book: 

This is the first book ever devoted to the Tiguex War, so it should attract interest throughout the Southwest and also appeal to the many people interested in the Indian wars and history in general; 
The 1500s Spanish conquest viewpoint has been presented repeatedly, but this is the first book on what the encounter must have been like for the Puebloans; 
The novel is researched so thoroughly that professors at two universities already have expressed interest in using the book in their classes, and a teacher at a Pueblo school wants the book for her students.



Other Ways You Can Help

<p style=""text-align: center; color: #000; font: bold 1em Tahoma,verdana,helvetica,arial,sans-serif; text-decoration: underline;"">The Dream
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I could barely hang on, my left hand reaching up,
precariously holding the edge of the cliff,<span> ""The White Cliffs of Dover.""  If I slipped it was a hundred meters straight
down to the rocks and ocean below and my death. 
The fear that coursed through my body was unlike any sensation that I
had ever felt before.  What was I going
to do?</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I looked up and saw him.<span> 
He was kneeling down on one knee his right elbow resting on his right
knee as he looked down at me.  His
emotionless, cold dark stare adding to the already chilling fear that I
felt.  He was dressed in the uniform of a Nazi officer, that familiar despised grey-green uniform with the </span>peaked
cap, or ""Schirmmutze"" as they were called, and the black high leather jack
boots.</p>
<p>I knew immediately who he was.<span>  His name was Cancer.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Looking up at him and feeling the fear I started to talk
to him, trying to rationalize with him, pleading with him to give me a
chance.<span>  He could have easily reached
over and flicked my fingers off the side of the cliff or stood up and stepped
on them, the result being the same. 
Death.  My life was his at that
moment.  He stared at me for what seemed
like an eternity.  I thought, how do you
rationalize with something so evil, so corrupt at it's core that just the
thought of it is enough to bring the strongest of souls to their knees?  </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I didn't know, I only felt deep down that I had to try, I
had to fight.<span>  It was my life.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">And so I continued to talk to him, plead with him,
starting what I would come to call the ""Good Fight,"" when slowly and
methodically, without taking his eyes off of mine, he stood straight up, turned
and slowly walked away.</p>
<p>I knew at that moment that I was being given a chance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I pulled myself up to the top of the cliff and stood
up.<span>  I looked inland and saw a large Nazi
prisoner camp surrounded by barbed wire, guard towers on each corner surrounded
by dozens of Nazi soldiers.  Some had
dogs with them, some were walking in pairs, some alone, all of them with the
familiar Mauser 98K rifles slung over their shoulders. I knew who they were and what they
represented.  They were cancer
cells.  </span></p>
<p>I knew that in order to survive I had to somehow get past
them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I looked to my left past the prisoner camp, the cancer,
and off in the distance I saw the most beautiful open field, the epitome of a
prairie scene with the wheat and grass golden and soft, gently bent over in a
soft wind.<span>  I immediately felt the peace
it stirred within me and I instinctively knew that if I could get to that field,
if I could just make it there that everything would be okay.  It represented a place of healing, peace and

</div>","Hello, my name is Ron Kolman and I need your help.  I am asking you to reach out and help me touch people's lives and perhaps give hope to those who are going through challenging times in their lives, specifically those battling cancer.You see, I've just come through my own battle with neck and throat cancer and have learned some very valuable lessons and that's why I'm here.  I'd like to ask you to share in the creation of my story by contributing towards the publishing of a book that I am writing.My case was one of the hardest and most complicated cases that they had ever seen at the cancer clinic and in fact was so unique that they didn't even have any statistics to go on and they really had to think outside of the box to put together a treatment program for me.  My cancer was so advanced and aggressive that the doctors had to decide whether to just put me in palliative care and let me go or to try and get after the cancer, and I am thankful and grateful that they chose the latter.So please help me make a positive impact on other people's lives by choosing one of the contribution levels with the perk or perks that you'd like to receive as thanks from me.Thank You!

The mask that I wore
during my radiation treatments.  The radiation is so precise that my head
had to be completely still and they would lock the mask into place so that I
wouldn't move during treatment.

The effects of 35
radiation treatments burned not only the outside of my skin but the inside of
my throat also to the point that I could not eat or even take a sip of water
orally and had to have a feeding tube inserted into my stomach to be able to provide
nourishment for my body.
About two weeks after
learning that I had cancer I had a dream.  It was very profound and was
for the first time since learning of my diagnosis I knew that not only was I
going to fight it, but that I was going to do anything that I had to in order
to win the Good Fight.  I have decided to start my book by sharing that
dream and I have included it below as a bit of a sneak peak introduction.
I humbly and gratefully thank you for helping me in
anyway you can to  achieve my goal of writing and publishing my book.
I wish
you peace, love and fulfillment in your life.
Ron :)
Learning how to use the feeding tube so that I could eat and drink.












                                                   

The Dream
I could barely hang on, my left hand reaching up,
precariously holding the edge of the cliff, ""The White Cliffs of Dover.""  If I slipped it was a hundred meters straight
down to the rocks and ocean below and my death. 
The fear that coursed through my body was unlike any sensation that I
had ever felt before.  What was I going
to do?
I looked up and saw him. 
He was kneeling down on one knee his right elbow resting on his right
knee as he looked down at me.  His
emotionless, cold dark stare adding to the already chilling fear that I
felt.  He was dressed in the uniform of a Nazi officer, that familiar despised grey-green uniform with the peaked
cap, or ""Schirmmutze"" as they were called, and the black high leather jack
boots.
I knew immediately who he was.  His name was Cancer.
Looking up at him and feeling the fear I started to talk
to him, trying to rationalize with him, pleading with him to give me a
chance.  He could have easily reached
over and flicked my fingers off the side of the cliff or stood up and stepped
on them, the result being the same. 
Death.  My life was his at that
moment.  He stared at me for what seemed
like an eternity.  I thought, how do you
rationalize with something so evil, so corrupt at it's core that just the
thought of it is enough to bring the strongest of souls to their knees?  
I didn't know, I only felt deep down that I had to try, I
had to fight.  It was my life.
And so I continued to talk to him, plead with him,
starting what I would come to call the ""Good Fight,"" when slowly and
methodically, without taking his eyes off of mine, he stood straight up, turned
and slowly walked away.
I knew at that moment that I was being given a chance.
I pulled myself up to the top of the cliff and stood
up.  I looked inland and saw a large Nazi
prisoner camp surrounded by barbed wire, guard towers on each corner surrounded
by dozens of Nazi soldiers.  Some had
dogs with them, some were walking in pairs, some alone, all of them with the
familiar Mauser 98K rifles slung over their shoulders. I knew who they were and what they
represented.  They were cancer
cells.  
I knew that in order to survive I had to somehow get past
them.
I looked to my left past the prisoner camp, the cancer,
and off in the distance I saw the most beautiful open field, the epitome of a
prairie scene with the wheat and grass golden and soft, gently bent over in a
soft wind.  I immediately felt the peace
it stirred within me and I instinctively knew that if I could get to that field,
if I could just make it there that everything would be okay.  It represented a place of healing, peace and
cure to me.  
And so I continued The Good Fight, praying, affirming life
and allowing myself to relax into a state of mindful peace and faith and started
to walk forward.  I do not know why,
perhaps as a disguise, maybe as acknowledgement of what was before me, but I
found myself also dressed in the uniform of the Nazi guards.
I kept present within the situation, an acceptance of
where I was with peace and calm.  I started
to walk towards them with a sense of faith and confidence, through them and
passed them, the soldiers, the cancer cells, and past the prisoner camp, the
representation of the cancer that had now manifested itself inside of me, and
towards the beautiful field that resonated healing and life to me.
I awoke that morning feeling a sense of peace and comfort.

<p>I hope you can help me raise the funds needed for the final research trip to New York City to finish my new book ""Line of Blood."" The book is about a journey.  A journey of discovering my family roots and solving a murder mystery! <br/></p>
<p>26 years ago I found a weathered newspaper article hidden in my grandmother's dresser about a New York Mobster who was mysteriously murdered in 1941.  I would discover that the mobster was my great uncle, and one of the biggest racketeers in Brooklyn and other neighboring territories.  His death was headline news for two weeks in newspapers across the country, and exposed a tremendous amount of police corruption in its wake.  Three years after this uncle's death, my other great uncle mysteriously disappeared trying to find out who killed his brother.  Their cases were never solved, and a 1947 newspaper article considered it one of the top five unsolved murders in New York to date.<br/></p>
<p>I started researching the mysteries of my great uncles many years ago, and the journey has led me down an astounding path of not only discovering my family, but also revealing a lost part of New York history that had been covered-up. I started writing the book about my adventures in solving the crimes five years ago, but could not finish it when my father died, as it was a research adventure the two of us had shared. <br/></p>
<p>Several months ago I decided to dedicate six months to editing the old manuscript, rewriting it and unearthing new clues to the 73-year old murder mystery I have spent half my life trying to solve. Now, as completion of the book is in sight, I need to take one more research trip to New York to literally unearth the final pieces of evidence in this long journey to finding the truth.</p>
<p>By contributing to this research trip you will be helping me to complete the final chapter, which is happening in real time, and solve the murder mystery that has haunted our family and remained a New York cold case for decades.  Your financial help will allow myself, a videographer and my team on the ground in NY, which now includes a cold-case detective and a psychic medium, to retrace the steps of my great uncle's final night, and unearth missing documentation.  We will be filming the entire adventure, and hope, with your help, to go back this summer.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I'm hoping to raise $4000, so the videographer and I can afford travel and lodging to New York, and to rent the equipment we need to film the experience and to dig through the ancient basement of the original headquarters of my great uncle's business in Brooklyn, where we know paper work and other important information is buried.  Part of the money will be also be used to pay fees for research and to pay for the services of the cold-case psychic.  Some of you may not believe in the metaphysical, but this truly gifted psychic has already given me many clues and names that we have been able to substantiate with real evidence. And, of course, to pay indiegogo.<br/></p>
<p>There are perks to donating!<br/></p>
<p> Any amount of donation is welcome, large or small.  Check out the perks of donating from receiving an advance copy of the book, to an exclusive DVD of the adventure in New York with the psychic medium and researchers.  Follow along with the action that will be the final chapter of the book!<br/></p>
<p>Other perks include complimentary research into YOUR family tree, and special thanks on my website and in the book acknowledgments.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will make a huge difference in completing this book, which is of historical value, as it sheds light on a piece of New York crime history that has never been told before.  The work is also a helpful example of how to utilize records and research when investigating your family heritage. </p>
<p>Most importantly, your contribution will bring us one step closer to revealing the real story behind the headlines and solving the case!<br/></p>
<p>In 2011, I raised over $20,000 on Kickstarter, and through private donations, to publish my photodocumentary ""Transfigurations."" That was a huge success and the book was published in a beautiful coffee table edition that went on to win ""Best LGBT non-fiction book of 2012"" by the Independent Publisher's Association Awards of New York.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Cruise into Happiness & Our Next Book! 
Thanks for stopping by! We're two women who are authors, professional speakers, have husbands and dogs, adore each other and are on a quest to spread happiness to the world, one set of ears – or in this case, eyes! – at a time. Here's who we are:
June Cline, CSP is a Southern, sassy, savvy, Harley-riding humorist who's worked with companies like PetSmart, Toyota and the National Dental Association, helping them understand the ROI of LOL. As a keynote speaker, she shows companies how to turn wit into wealth with colleagues, customers and clients.
Sandy Weaver Carman is creative, compassionate and crazy - in a fun sort of way! She's an award-winning author, speaker and radio personality who works with writers, speakers, trainers and coaches, taking their existing work and turning it into audio products.

We teamed up in 2013 to produce an online radio show, Happiness Recipe, and it's a world-wide hit. Each week, we interview thought leaders, asking them to share their wit, wisdom and wonderful food. Internationally recognized speakers and authors spend half an hour talking about what makes them happy, how they spread happiness in the world and one specific food that makes their taste-buds happy. 
We're putting together a book of the best of our first year of shows. ""Happiness Recipe - Whippin' up Happiness with Wit, Wisdom and Wonderful Food!"" will be out just in time for those New Year's resolutions to be happier that people make! Twenty of our guests are serving up their own Happiness Recipes in this book, and you can be part of the fun! Though not a cookbook, you will have access to some fabulous recipes when the book is published.   What We Need & What You Get What do you get? Anything from honorable mention to a Caribbean cruise!

We're so excited about our first Happiness Summit - September of 2015, cruising the western Caribbean. Maybe you've been there before, but this is all about the Happiness Experience! We'll have surprise guests, celebrities and fun folks sharing their happiness recipes with you. Your room will have a balcony - who wants to sail without being able to see the sea? 
We're looking for funding to produce the Happiness Recipe book in paperback, eBook and audio book formats so people can get happier any way they choose! We're working with publishing professionals, editors, graphic designers and layout artists, none of whom work for free, dang it!

<h3><b>Arcenciel Publishing<br/></b></h3>
<p>Once upon a time, I saw my high school classmates reading. The teenaged girls read Sweet Dreams romances.  Our more adventurous classmates read Silhouette Romances, the red ones. The boys read adventures. And comics. And I wondered why there was nothing like that for me.  So I read the requisite YA novels, and later, the Harry Potters and Dan Browns and wondered why there weren't any good characters who were people like me. <br/><br/> At a salon, I saw the female attendants reading Precious Hearts Romances and wondered what the pretty trans lady with the flaming hair read when she had no customers. (It was Yes Magazine, a showbiz Filipino gossip mag.) </p>
<p>That was the beginning of Arcenciel. It means rainbow. To us, it's not just a symbol of diversity, it is also a sign that after the rain, things get better. More beautiful. Hopeful. This is what Arcenciel Publishing hopes to accomplish. For the confused child who thinks he is alone. For the adolescent who wonders why no one understands.
Because if people did, there would be books like that, yes? <br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Our Mission</b></h3>
<p>We write books for People Like Us. The disenfranchised and deprived. The ones who can't find people like them till much later and after spending too many years thinking we're the only ones.  We write and publish for us, whose dreams are often limited because of a society that dictates the distance we can reach. As the world around us changes, there are still places where progress moves at a glacial pace, some even taking ten steps back from where they’re supposed to go. <br/><br/>The first book is called Teka, Wait... Di Ako Prepared. I wrote this first book for my Filipino LGBT community, because we, LGBT and people of color, as well as those who stand with us, wondering what chance we have in a world that's been made harder for us,  need to keep dreaming for our happy ending. 
<br/><br/>The next books will be for and from the other people of the rainbow– not necessarily LGBT, but the diverse groups: the family with children on the spectrum, the ethnic child trying to maintain his or her identity in a colonial society, the one who is a hundred pounds overweight or underweight, the ones they call different, the ones they call handicapped. Teka, wait!  First things first.  Ito muna. <br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>About Teka, Wait...Di Ako Prepared<br/></b></h3>
<p>Teka, Wait...Di Ako Prepared is a Filipino book about growing up gay. It's not heavy literature. It's not some deep, dark peek into the underbelly of whatever it is people seem to want to focus on when it comes to Filipino LGBT lit. It's a book about growing up gay. And a little peek into what lies ahead. And about happy endings– at the end of the harder road we've all been dealt.
We think it's what our community needs. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Where We Are Now</b></h3>
<p>Three weeks away. Literally. We feel like we’ve done a pretty decent job writing a Filipino book for the LGBT reader that isn't too much fluff nor too deep and heavy. Something readable. Something to get them to read more.  It's been written, rewritten, beta'd, edited and reedited and ready for the online reader. But. <br/><br/>The people whom we want to read this book most– no, the people we think NEED to read this book – will need a printed copy. <br/></p>
<br/><br/><h3><b>What We Need</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We’re done with the book but we want to see it in print. Good old paper and cardstock cover print. Because the people we want to reach are the ones who, as kids, never got around to love reading because they never got past the ""why is there nothing for me to read"" point like I did. People who never got past  never seeing a book have a character they could identify with, and so never loved reading as much as we do.   They probably read, what, a book a year?

In this day and age, trying to read on a phone or a tablet, or on the computer will be too distracting.
We think this book needs to be on paper. We need your help getting this book out. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Where You Come In</b></h3>
<p>We could really use some
help. It will cost  around $15,000 just to get an initial run on print. We'd like to print more, and get it to the hands of the people who need to read it. After that, we'll need to get it out to the hands of people who need to read it the most. Elbow grease, leg work, kapal ng mukha. And of course, money.<br/><br/>After we're done with this run, we're going to translate it into English. And if that goes well, perhaps other languages. Because we know there are more people who need to know there are people like them. So please, help in what way you can. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can donate. That doesn't mean you can't help–<br/>you can put in a good word for us and our project with your friends. Help us get the word out to people who can make this happen. Share our link on your wall. Tweet it to your friends. And if you're at The Manila Pride March in December, come see us and a grab a bookmark anyway. <br/></p>

</p><p><b>Bref résumé</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Lutte 2.0 est la nouvelle-vague de la lutte québécoise. Nous mélangeons l'esthétique du cinéma et l'action intense de la lutte professionnelle. Vous avez envie de voir sur vos écrans une telle émission produite par des cinéastes et des tripeux de lutte ? N'attendez pas un instant de plus et contribuez à ce projet de pur divertissement extrême !!!</b></p><p>Je m'appelle Nicolas Proulx, je suis dans le monde du cinéma depuis plus de 15 ans en tant que producteur, réalisateur, scénariste et caméraman. Le septième art n’est pas ma seule passion ; je suis aussi un mordu de la lutte depuis l'âge de 5 ans. Cette passion m'a amené à une carrière parallèle de lutteur indépendant entre 1998 et 2009. Malheureusement, à la suite d’une fracture du fémur en 2009, je n’ai pu poursuivre cette activité.</p>
<p>Je souhaite m'impliquer à nouveau dans ce domaine, et combiner mes deux passions pour le cinéma et pour la lutte. Avec mon équipe, je propose de filmer quelques événements de la fédération « PWA » pour ensuite transformer le produit en émission mensuelle pour le <i>Web</i>. Cette émission se démarquera par une vision plus cinématographique de l'événement. Nous y ajouterons des segments en coulisse impliquant des changements narratifs intenses et imprévisibles. Pour accompagner l’action d’une manière dynamique, il y aura plusieurs angles de caméra dans le feu de l'action, un montage innovateur et des commentateurs excentriques.</p>
<p>Mentionnons que la programmation prévue cet été pour les événements de la PWA mettra en vedette des superstars internationales telles que Mason Ryan (<i>WWE</i>), Abyss (ancien champion du monde <i>TNA</i>), Sylvain Grenier (ancien champion par équipe <i>WWE</i>), Rob Terry (ancien TV champion à <i>TNA</i>) ainsi que des lutteurs bien connus au Québec comme Marko Estrada, Darko, Dru Onyx entre autres. </p>
<p><b>À quoi servira la subvention demandée ?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Le projet financera 6 émissions Web. Ces émissions seront présentées mensuellement à partir de l'automne 2015 sur YouTube, Facebook et sur un site web attitré au projet. Bien sûr, nous tâcherons de donner de l’ampleur au projet pour attirer l’attention des médias et de la télévision. Votre soutien est le coup de main dont nous avons besoin pour commencer cette belle aventure.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Le montant servira à rémunérer les employés attitrés au projet : un monteur image et sonore, un recherchiste, deux commentateurs, deux caméramans, un producteur et un concepteur web. Nous avons déjà filmé une partie du projet bénévolement, car nous croyons au potentiel de l'émission. Nous sommes certains qu'avec votre aide, nous parviendrons à un résultat professionnel comparable à des productions indépendantes comme « ROH », « TOW » et « House of Hardcore ».</li>
<li>Si le montant visé n'est pas atteint, nous essaierons de compléter le financement par des commandites et des subventions. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>       L'impact</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Depuis 1991, la télévision québécoise (à l'exception de RDS) ne présente plus d’émissions de lutte. Pourtant, lors de la diffusion des matchs de la WWF par TVA, les côtes d'écoutes étaient excellentes. Au Québec, plusieurs organisations de lutte québécoise profitent d'une popularité notable. Pourtant, aucune plateforme télévisuelle ne s'intéresse à eux.</li>
<li>Depuis 1998, j'ai produit une vingtaine de courts-métrages, plusieurs vidéoclips, une série Web, une web-télé (Vision Donnacona), un long-métrage documentaire (en cours de montage) et j'ai travaillé sur de nombreux tournages cinématographiques professionnels. </li>
<li>En ce qui concerne la lutte, j'ai eu une carrière indépendante entre 1998 et 2009. J'ai lutté pour des fédérations telles que « CCW », « RCW » et « R2W ». J'ai aussi joué les rôles d'arbitre et de manager  en plus de faire un reportage à Boston (<i>RDS.CA)</i> sur l'école de lutte du légendaire Killer Kowalsky. Enfin, j'ai aussi à mon actif un documentaire/best-off appelé « West Side Connection ». </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p><b>Risques et défis</b></p>
<ul>
<li>La lutte indépendante sur le Web possède une popularité importante et le fait de bénéficier de la participation de stars connues, amènera leurs partisans à s'intéresser à notre produit. Par exemple, en profitant du partage sur la page Facebook de superstars comme « Abyss » qui possèdent plus de 5000 inscrits, nous élargissons considérablement l’auditoire pour nos émissions. </li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Ça fait au-dessus de quinze ans que je produis et réalise des tournages. J'ai l'habitude de gérer des budgets. Je n'ai jamais excédé le budget accordé, et ce, en menant à terme les projets en respectant les prévisions.</li>
<li>Advenant que les émissions n'obtiennent pas la popularité espérée, notre stratégie de promotion s’articulera en trois niveaux. Tout d’abord, la promotion des émissions se fera à travers la présentation de l’univers de « Lutte 2.0 » via la presse écrite et audiovisuelle. La première émission sera distribuée aux journaux, radios et télévisions de la région de Québec dès sa sortie. Nous tenterons d'intéresser les chaînes de télévision importante comme Radio-Canada, TVA, Télé-Québec et Canal V pour qu'elles présentent un reportage en pleine heure d’écoute, consacré au projet. De même, les chaines de radio comme 93.3 FM, CHOI FM, ROUGE FM et les journaux du Québec seront sollicités. Dans le passé, nous avons procédé de cette manière pour faire connaître une de nos séries appelée « Studio Ste-Cravache ». Par la suite, Radio-Canada, CHYZ-FM, CHOI-FM, Info-Portneuf, Le Courrier de Portneuf ont tous fait des reportages sur le concept. Cela a suscité plus de mille visites en quelques jours sur YouTube, en plus d'une soirée de première réussie dans le bar pour artiste « Le Cercle ». Le nom et le concept de l’émission s’en sont trouvés efficacement propagés.</li>
<li>Le deuxième niveau promotionnel passera par la tenue d'événements de promotions (ex. soirées de premières et activités promotionnelles) pendant lesquels l’émission sera présentée devant une audience. Le troisième niveau promotionnel se situe sur le web. Nous ouvrirons un site internet  que nous mettrons à jour régulièrement. Le site sera pourvu de différentes fonctions d’interactivités permettant une propagation virale du site et de ses informations sur une multitude de réseaux et sous différentes formes. Sur ce site, nous présenterons des vidéos à propos de notre produit. De plus, nous tiendrons informé notre auditoire des dernières nouvelles et promotions, tout en exposant constamment de nouvelles photos des lutteurs. Nous entendons tirer profit de la forte tendance actuelle des réseaux sociaux. Aussi une page Facebook sera créée pour l’émission afin de regrouper nos auditeurs, de les tenir informés et d’interagir le plus possible avec eux. Dans la même optique, un compte Twitter sera éventuellement opérationnel. Par le biais des réseaux sociaux, nous souhaitons impliquer notre audience dans l'amélioration du produit. Nous espérons que le bouche à oreille et la mise en place de cette stratégie de promotion nous permettront de propager le concept de notre série et de nous constituer un auditoire de base, que nous escomptons agrandir continuellement par une promotion assidue via les trois niveaux compris dans notre stratégie.</li>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Saving the Front</i> follows the trials and tribulations of Army nurses serving on the frontlines during WWII.<br/><br/>My name is M.E. Gustafson, and I am the author of <i>Saving the Front</i>. I wrote this book to honor the service of Army nurses who risked their lives to provide medical care on the frontlines.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover more about what life was like for WWII nurses on the frontlines. I hope this book excites the same passion and excitement in you that I have for historical fiction. Ultimately, I want you to learn more about the experience of nursing units during WWII.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the foreign nursing service and medical care at the front. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>The terrifying task of disembarking from a military transport ship. Timed in between the giant swells, military personnel carried all their luggage and equipment down a solitary ladder to the barges that will carry them to land</li>
<li>Rendering medical care by lamplight. With limited medical supplies and medicine, every resource available was used</li>
<li>What life was like living under the path of mortar shells, the threat of sniper fire, and air raids</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy historical fiction, WWII history, and spunky characters.<br/><br/><i>Saving the Front</i> is a fiction book that speaks to history fans and those who want to look at World War II and women’s military service in a new way.<br/><br/><i><strong>25% of net proceeds from all book sales will be donated to charities supporting military personnel and their families</strong></i></p>
<h3>The Book: <i>Saving the Front</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 2 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-5. From training drills to submarine attacks, you will follow their journey from the United States to Europe as they prepare to serve on the frontlines<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 6-20. Military barracks give way to canvas cots in wind-blown tents. Life on the frontlines is marred by mortar shells, insufficient medical supplies, and dwindling resources.</p>

<h3>The story of <i>These Moments of Grief</i>
</h3>
<p>For many people, the world changed in 2020 but my world changed in 2019 when my mother passed away.<br/><br/>My name is DC and I am the author of <i>These Ordinary Moments of Grief</i>. I wrote this book partly because I was restless to produce something creative from being home often, and partly because I had too many thoughts about my own grief swirling in my head. Sometimes, I would share a few of these thoughts to the virtual world and people seem to like it, literally liking my posts. Still, I have so much more to say, words that can’t all fit on a Facebook post or Instagram caption. This memoir is a collection of my curated musings, memories, and introspection on my loss; all my ordinary moments of grief. These are all the things I learned about myself in my grief and grief itself. Most of all, these are all the ways I miss my mother.<br/><br/>Reading this book may be difficult because it will remind you that one day, you will experience loss. If you’ve already experienced loss, it will remind you of all the ways you’ve lost your person. Nevertheless, I encourage you to read this book to understand what one person's grief is like and to confront the awful truth that grief is here to stay for as long as we continue living in a mortal world and loving mortal people. Don’t worry. You won’t be alone. We will confront it together.<br/><br/><i>These Ordinary Moments of Grief </i>is not a book that teaches you how to deal with your grief, provides tips or lessons, or prepares you for grief. This book is simply about what it was like for one ordinary person to lose her precious mother. It is dedicated to the grievers and the not yet grievers, for everyone that is curious about grief and anyone that is lonely in their grief.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>These Ordinary Moments of Grief</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I find ways to express my grief? Or talk to grieving people?</li>
<li>Why is it so uncomfortable to confront grief in a world full of loss and suffering?</li>
<li>How would the world be different, our relationships with one another, if we learn to talk about grief with one another?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</p>

<h3><b>About the Author</b></h3>
<p><br/>DC is too shy to share who she is publicly but rest assured, everything in her memoir is true–at least from her perspective and interpretations of events. When she is not creating an alter ego for herself, DC is either working at a nonprofit with the ambitious goal of ending homelessness or serving in the church community she was raised in. She would describe her lifestyle as an introvert living an extroverted life because she is constantly torn between being a homebody and meeting with the people God has blessed her with. Lately, she’s been daydreaming about becoming a Young Adult writer and having a podcast where she analyzes Korean Dramas in-depth.<br/><br/><br/>DC wrote <i>These Ordinary Moments of Grief </i>because she felt misunderstood about her grief and she didn’t know how to talk about her loss with others. This is her first step in overcoming her fears and insecurities about creating dialogue about grief. Before she engages others in these difficult conversations, she wants to first understand what her thoughts and reflections really are. Even though she knows she will never fully understand the complexities of grief, she hopes she’s off to a good start by examining and sharing all her salad days of grief in this memoir.<br/><br/>To get to know DC better, you can stalk her Instagram at @dearsaladdays. The more follows she gets, the more she will post :)</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Bigger Than Leadership</i> is a book focused on sharing how life and leadership intersect through stories. These stories will showcase the power of everyday leadership and exemplify what it looks like in our lives.<br/><br/>My name is Brittany Do, and I am the author of <i>Bigger Than Leadership</i>.

Topics include empathy, inspiration, purpose, and so many others. I interviewed <strong>84 people</strong>, ranging from students to retired individuals about their leadership experiences. These people include dozens of leaders in their respective industries. You'll hear their stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>When a blind woman training for a triathlon encouraged and inspired someone training for the same triathlon</li>
<li>How to help someone else even if you don’t have a solution to their problem</li>
<li>How a hockey camp taught lifelong lessons bigger than hockey itself</li>
</ul>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Brittany Do is a sophomore at the University of Washington studying Finance and Accounting. She is passionate about people, leadership, and dogs.<br/><br/>She felt compelled to write this book because she believes that the past leadership experiences she’s gained have helped shape the person she is today. After interviewing so many people (about 85!), she realized that she needed to focus on why everyone is inherently a leader. What she hopes for is the book to help spread this perspective and inspire others in the process.<br/><br/>For fun, she likes to read books, and she’s recently gotten into audiobooks after finding out about the app Libby. Of course, she also loves talking to and meeting people. She conducted most of her book interviews over Zoom, and one time she ran into her wall in a hurry, earning a bruise in the process. This didn’t slow her down in writing her book, though, but she did momentarily forget why her elbow was hurting so much.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Brittany at brittanywdo@gmail.com, via LinkedIn at <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittanydo/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittanydo/</a>, and on Instagram at @brittanysbooks.author.<br/> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish.

<h3>Hello</h3>
<p>My name is Keith Leech, I am aged 65, a retired electronic engineer living in Australia.</p>
<p>I have a keen interest in renewable energy and due to my engineering training and experience I am well qualified to analyze the claims made by promoters of new improved renewal energy inventions (aka Green Widgets).</p>
<p>Back in 2007 I stumbled across a new type of solar collector called the SunBall which promised to deliver amazing performance at a much lower price than anything else on the market. It was featured on the ABC Television program ""The New Inventors"" and was promised for delivery any day soon.</p>
<p>The inventor Greg Watson was inviting pre-orders from customers and was offering manufacturing/distribution licenses for sale worldwide starting at $1M per territory.</p>
<p>When the deadline for delivery of the SunBall was missed, Watson announced that an improved version called the SunCube would be ready real soon.</p>
<p>I realised that the performance claims made for the SunBall/SunCube were an impossibility and discovered that Greg Watson had a long track record in the Snake Oil industry.</p>
<p>I began an internet campaign using the pen name Keef Wivanef to expose the scam.</p>
<p>Greg Watson became rather annoyed and said rude things about me . He threatened to sue me for defamation and called ME a liar, immoral, unethical and a criminal.</p>
<p>I took HIM to court for defamation and won my case.</p>
<p>I was awarded costs of $50K and damages of $30K</p>
<p>Watson's company Green and Gold Energy went into receivership and Watson has fled the country.</p>
<p>I have been unable to recover any of the money that I am owed.</p>
<p>This makes me a sad panda.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have written a book The SunCube Fiasco which has been favourably reviewed by publishers.</p>
<p>The book tells the amazing tragic but funny story of how one con-artist duped investors and government departments out of millions of dollars and went on to cause BILLION dollar losses to shareholders in Emcore USA.</p>
<p>The story is indeed, stranger (and funnier) than fiction and a ripping yarn</p>
<p>I will explain how much damage this and similar scams are doing to the cause of renewable energy by stealing funds which should be going into genuine research and development</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The funding is needed to have the book professionally edited and made ready for publication in both E-book and paperback.</p>
<p>The book will need a major marketing campaign to reach a wide audience.</p>
<p>I have a publisher who will do all of this but because the subject may only interest a niche market, and is unlikely to enter the best-selling list I am required to cover some of the up-front costs.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Hello
My name is Keith Leech, I am aged 65, a retired electronic engineer living in Australia.
I have a keen interest in renewable energy and due to my engineering training and experience I am well qualified to analyze the claims made by promoters of new improved renewal energy inventions (aka Green Widgets).
Back in 2007 I stumbled across a new type of solar collector called the SunBall which promised to deliver amazing performance at a much lower price than anything else on the market. It was featured on the ABC Television program ""The New Inventors"" and was promised for delivery any day soon.
The inventor Greg Watson was inviting pre-orders from customers and was offering manufacturing/distribution licenses for sale worldwide starting at $1M per territory.
When the deadline for delivery of the SunBall was missed, Watson announced that an improved version called the SunCube would be ready real soon.
I realised that the performance claims made for the SunBall/SunCube were an impossibility and discovered that Greg Watson had a long track record in the Snake Oil industry.
I began an internet campaign using the pen name Keef Wivanef to expose the scam.
Greg Watson became rather annoyed and said rude things about me . He threatened to sue me for defamation and called ME a liar, immoral, unethical and a criminal.
I took HIM to court for defamation and won my case.
I was awarded costs of $50K and damages of $30K
Watson's company Green and Gold Energy went into receivership and Watson has fled the country.
I have been unable to recover any of the money that I am owed.
This makes me a sad panda.
 
 
Short Summary
I have written a book The SunCube Fiasco which has been favourably reviewed by publishers.
The book tells the amazing tragic but funny story of how one con-artist duped investors and government departments out of millions of dollars and went on to cause BILLION dollar losses to shareholders in Emcore USA.
The story is indeed, stranger (and funnier) than fiction and a ripping yarn
I will explain how much damage this and similar scams are doing to the cause of renewable energy by stealing funds which should be going into genuine research and development
 
 


What We Need 
 
The funding is needed to have the book professionally edited and made ready for publication in both E-book and paperback.
The book will need a major marketing campaign to reach a wide audience.
I have a publisher who will do all of this but because the subject may only interest a niche market, and is unlikely to enter the best-selling list I am required to cover some of the up-front costs.
Even though I warned ASIC and other authorities that the SunCube was a scam nothing was done to prevent Watson from stealing millions of dollars.
Despite winning my court battle with Watson I have been unable to recover any of my legal costs or damages. 
The book exposes the legal loophole which allows any unscrupulous businessperson to CLAIM that he has a wonderful new planet saving invention and then trouser the money year after year while he makes excuse after excuse for the delays.
The book is written but needs to be edited and vetted by legal experts. (Green Scam promotors love to make threats of defamation actions)
 
& What You Get
Rewards include warm fuzzy feelings for helping Keef.
An E-book which you won't be able to switch off.
Perks include all of the above AND you will be able to argue with me online.
If I don't reach my goal then you'll still get the book, I'll carry on moaning on the internet forums as usual.


The Impact
Crowd funding is an excellent idea.....BUT!!!
How do you keep the unscrupulous operators/con-artists out.
The SunCube confidence scam pre-dates crowd-funding but the tried and proven Green Widget Scam is even easier nowadays.
If you read this story you will understand that the net has expanded the reaches of sociopathic con-artists.
I am working to have the law  changed to so that scammers no longer enjoy the presumtion of innocence defense.
 
 


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.


Cool!


Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!


Try to remember........... what was that again?


And that’s all there is to it.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>HELLO EVERYONE</p>
<p>My name Is Michael John. Two years ago I began to start following my dreams, and decided to really start to write that book that I wanted to write. I finally wrote it, and through hard work, and a lot of researching I decided to take all the money that I've earned and self publish my book. I can say now that My book, Negative = Positive will be out March 5th, 2012. My book is an inspirational book, to help everyone, all ages, races, and demographics. My purpose is to spread the word of my book, so people across the world will be encouraged to follow their dreams. I've worked three jobs for three years to raise the funds to self publish my book.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I raise the money, It will be enough for me to ""book"" a desired venue,and will allow me to have an Official Book release party. The party will allow other young artist, such as singers, actors, poets, ect... of my city (Newark, De) to be showcased. This event  will showcase some parts of my book, such as, showing people that among all the negativity, there are so much more young people like myself, who are striving to achieve their goals and dreams.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$2,500 is the goal. ""The hall of Elegance"", party planning, catering, decorations, photos, sound, and the helping hands, cause for a budget of $2,500. If I don't get all what is needed here,we will do a fund raiser at our local Red Robin, where if you come out and eat, 10% of your bill will be donated to the event. If I receive the a total of $2,500, and so happen don't need all of the funds, we will donate the rest to a charity. Being that my book is an advocate for suicide victims, we will find the best charity that supports this. There isn't any donation to small, or too big. I will accept anything low as $1.00 (US).  Depending on your contribution, you may receive a free copy of my Book, signed with a personal message, and other small promotional items.</p>
