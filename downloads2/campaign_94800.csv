That’s why every EATI comes with a lifetime warranty (that far eclipses our own!)    About usSEPTEM was established by a small design team who are passionate about bringing cool, sleek technology ideas to life, as well as striving to inspire others and foster an exploratory mindset.Design is our passion, our hobby, and our vocation. With this project, we’re trying to bring something new to the world, and Kickstarter is an amazing platform to do that. We design to last.  Durable and re-usable, Food safe, recyclable materials.  Our supporters receive the best prices and get the unique chance to follow the whole manufacturing process from start to finish. We’re super excited to be back with our fourth project.",17.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<p>Hello! We are creators of nuka. All of us have used stationery for years, so we know all benefits and problems related to it. We saw advantages of digital notes but realized: nothing can replace the tactile experience of real materials. So, we decided to add modern technologies to stationery, and created radically new things – eternal notebook and pencil. Fired by this idea, we left school and started focusing only on nuka. Together with our partners, we have worked for 2 years to tailor business strategy, finalize technologies, work on prototypes and run production in China. Hope you are ready to change habitual things together with us. Let’s start!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>The launch of every product is followed by the unforeseen technological challenges, and we have overcome them vigilantly. We reduced our risks before the launch of the product by giving ourselves 24 months of R&amp;D; research to determine which materials were the best to create nuka’s eternal stationary. This was done by creating prototypes of both, the notebook and the pencil. We have a manufacturing staff ready in place to not only produce the product but to also package and deliver it to you. Currently, our goal is to start our campaign on Kickstarter to gather funds that could be further invested in our eternal stationery for you, and in the app to make your note-keeping easier. We know that there may be some issues with production we cannot foresee. However, the most important thing is that you invest in our nuka team that will bring the product to you.

Hello! We are creators of nuka. All of us have used stationery for years, so we know all benefits and problems related to it. We saw advantages of digital notes but realized: nothing can replace the tactile experience of real materials. So, we decided to add modern technologies to stationery, and created radically new things – eternal notebook and pencil. Fired by this idea, we left school and started focusing only on nuka. Together with our partners, we have worked for 2 years to tailor business strategy, finalize technologies, work on prototypes and run production in China. Hope you are ready to change habitual things together with us. Let’s start!

Risks & Challenges
The launch of every product is followed by the unforeseen technological challenges, and we have overcome them vigilantly. We reduced our risks before the launch of the product by giving ourselves 24 months of R&D; research to determine which materials were the best to create nuka’s eternal stationary. This was done by creating prototypes of both, the notebook and the pencil. We have a manufacturing staff ready in place to not only produce the product but to also package and deliver it to you. Currently, our goal is to start our campaign on Kickstarter to gather funds that could be further invested in our eternal stationery for you, and in the app to make your note-keeping easier. We know that there may be some issues with production we cannot foresee. However, the most important thing is that you invest in our nuka team that will bring the product to you.

We've labelled them in the same direction allowing for easy conversions.  The 30° Ruler is designed to eliminate the confusion and strain of reading your typical ruler,  so every tick mark is labelled. 
On the Imperial measurement side, all hash marks are labelled to eliminate guessing and counting of lines.  
On the Metric measurement side, both the millimetres and centimetres are numbered and the hash marks rise and fall making it easy to identify specific millimetre measurements.
  The 30° Ruler starts at zero. It is another simple design feature meaning you can start measuring from the very edge of the ruler instead of having to make adjustments for the useless blank space before the laser engraved measurements.  The ruler itself is made from aerospace-grade aluminium while the measurements are laser targeted. In addition to making it more durable, the advanced materials make the 30° Ruler more lightweight and scratch-resistant.  What’s New？New Color. New Size.  The ruler also comes in four sizes of 15cm/6inch, 20cm/8inch, 30cm/12inch and 45cm/18inch; so you can choose the right sized ruler depending on what you’re measuring.  The new colour was one of the biggest asks we got from our previous backers. And we don't disappoint our backers! We exist because of you guys, so we're proud to offer the new colours and new sizes.  Not sure which you like? Don’t worry about that yet! You will get to select your colour choice at the survey time.    Thank You We love sharing our passion for this ruler.Through Indiegogo, we can cordially invite you on our journey and share with you the manufacturing process. We are passionate about what we do, and the opportunity to serve you and bring such a fantastic product to market has been an incredible adventure.",16.0,0,"8 Campaigns

The first button that stays in sync with your video conferencing tool of choice!
 
 

 
 
 Knowing when you are on mute or unmute is not always obvious to computer users, virtual meeting participants, or those physically around them. When on a computer, the status of the microphone may be obscured by multiple windows being open, a particular program being minimized, or a user may be inattentive to the microphone state by using multiple monitors. Typically, knowing when your microphone is muted or unmuted requires locating the online conference window and identifying the condition of the microphone icon.    Speaking with anyone around the world through a virtual meeting has become significant during the COVID-19 pandemic. But, frequent video conferencing problems have been the cause of embarrassment because either the person using virtual meetings did not know their microphones were on, or people have walked in on their meetings.  As a result, users and those around the user need to know a conference is occurring and if a microphone is on.   MuteMe™ is an illuminated mute button for virtual calls that increases productivity, boosts confidence, and decreases interruptions. The patent-pending device is designed to recognize if you're on or off mute by using intelligent software that works with any computer to control your microphone. Not only is it just a button, it's an app! Our app stays in sync with the MuteMe illuminated button, so if you mute from the virtual conferencing app, the light on the button and the app change together!

Great! Don't be shy about sharing Razorbooster with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below.<br/>The more people who know about Razorbooster, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Razorbooster!</p></div>","Introducing Razorbooster, the world’s 1st Smart Razor Blade Cleaner & Sharpener. It is the ultimate tool for facial hair upkeeping! Razorbooster cleans your razor blades like a pro, and sharpens them in no time while prolonging the life of your blades. It looks awesome, and is a must have accessory for any men with facial hair. ​  ​ Using the same razor blade over and over again can lead to various problems. On average men change their razor cartridges every one to two weeks. But even within this short period, the blades can easily and quickly become contaminated and dull to the point where you may experience skin irritation. However, now there is a solution to this problem! Let us help you keep your razor blades clean, protect your skin, and save money all at the same time!The razor blades you use every day are a breeding ground for viruses and bacteria, which can cause severe skin problems. No matter how thoroughly you rinse the cartridge after using it, you will not be able to clean it of all the dead skin cells and hair stuck between the blades, and the dirty blades will eventually damage your skin. This is why you need Razorbooster. It enables you to thoroughly clean your blades and protect your skin.  ​​As mentioned, the average man changes their razor blades once every week or two. On Amazon, a Gillette razor blade pack containing eight cartridges costs around $32, or $4 per cartridge. If we assume that you change your razor blades every two weeks, that would mean that you would need 26 cartridges per year. Thus, you’d be paying a total of $96 every year for razor blades. However, as Razorbooster cleans, it also disinfects and sharpens your razor blades increasing the blades’ average lifespan three times over three times That means that instead of exchanging your razor blades every two weeks you can safely use your blades for six weeks or more. This way, you can reduce the amount you’re spending on razor blades from $96 to only $32 per year.  2 billion razors and refill blades are thrown away, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency.Dull razor blades can not be recycled, so they just turn into waste that harms the environment. Why not start today and use Razorbooster, so we can contribute a little bit to cleaning our planet! Using Razorbooster is a rational choice when it comes to a healthy lifestyle and sharp shaving    What do you think sharpens a razor blade when you clean it? It isn't the water. However, Jeans, Razorpit, and Razorbooster do sharpen the blade by removing substances on the edge of the blades.But the distinct difference that sets the Razorbooster apart is it uses 12 rubber blades that can fit between those 2~5 blades, so it can clean and sharpen neatly even between razor blades. And also by using Sanitizing Liquid that contains tiny ""Ceramic Balls"", helps to grind the blades. Normal razor-cleaning products do not feature dual blade-protection and razor-cleaning power at the same time. Generally, the sanitizers we use on our blades remove viruses or germs but do not aid in the sharpening process. Also, products such as the Razor Pit can damage not only the blade itself but also the blade’s frame, making it harder to use over time. Razorbooster is made the ideal size for most razor blades to protect the lubricants of the blades and rubber bumps protect the razor blades as much as possible.​ Every razor blade cleaning product tends to do one thing: they either clean, sanitize, or sharpen. However, Razorbooster can clean, sanitize, and sharpen at the same time.     Razorbooster is equipped with a strong motor that enables you to easily and comfortably clean and sharpens your razor blades. It clean and brushes the blades 600 times per second, thereby making the blades so sharp that they feel brand new.     Rinsing your razor blades with water can neither clean out the dirt that gets stuck between the blades nor can it possibly remove the various types of viruses and bacteria that grow there.Razorbooster cleans razorblades substantially more effectively than just rinsing them with water ever could.   While you might not be able to see much difference right now, zoom into the images and you'll see the difference. In the picture on the left, you can see the microscopic debris left on the blades after rinsing them with water. By using Razorbooster, however, the blades become completely clean and are safe to reuse. Razerbooster is powered by a small electric motor, and it contains 12 rubber blades that clean and brush 600 times per second, sharpening razor blades and offering 99% sterilization.   ​ ​The Sanitizing Liquid was created with natural, healing ingredients such as charcoal, a safe ingredient which is dark grey and viscous ceramic ball. It also contains tiny ceramic balls that act as a blade sharpener.Also You can use 120ml liquid for 120~200 times/4~6 months even if you shave everyday! Conventional razor blade cleaners usually come in the form of detergents and are thus not effective when it comes to removing smaller dirt particles. Razorbooster, on the other hand, contains charcoal and tiny grains that help sharpen the blades and make them perfectly clean, thanks to the charcoal’s property of absorbing even microscopic dirt particles.  Charcoal is an organic ingredient that often appears in face cleansing or mask products and is well known as an ingredient that absorbs oil, impurities, and toxic substances!! 99.9% Razor blade sterilization! Reduction of skin troubles Test proven sterilizer It’s reasonable to doubt the quality of Chinese OEM products! These types of low-quality products frequently breakdown. At Razorbooster, we take care when considering the material and manufacturing process. Samsung, Hyundai, and BTS are all high quality products that made in Korea!        ​​​​   Provides a switch that enables settings for a left-handed or right-handed user. Anyone can use Razorbooster with ease! Choose R for right-handed, and L for left-handed. Razorbooster uses a NiMH battery which requires 6 hours of charging for a full charge. The battery will last approximately 30 days before requiring a recharge. No worries if the battery runs low. You can use Razorbooster while it’s being recharged. Just make sure to pull the plug when rinsing the device after use. Razorbooster is compatible with almost all razors. The protective rubber part matches the size of all conventional razors and offers maximum protection for the razor’s lubricant while the blades are cleaned and sharpened with strong rotational power. This technology makes it possible to use your razor cartridges for a long time!In testing, eight different razors were used to assess Razorbooster’s compatibility. All of them were effectively cleaned. Rubber blades were made to match the exact size of the razor blade, which prevents damage to the lubricating band.   Many women also use razors to keep their skin smooth and clean. They sometimes use the razor blade on other sensitive parts of skin, so it is absolutely crucial to keep the razor blades clean and sharp. Therefore, Razorbooster was designed in a way that makes it compatible with women’s razors as well. Only cartridges with big moisture bars do not fit into the opening and can thus not be used.      Razorbooster was reviewed by the Youtube channels ""Modern Man TV"",“Man Cave KYLE” and “Review Man Chang soo.” It is currently trending in Korea! >> Please turn on the subtitles to English, when you watch the video << Razorbooster is also featured in Gigadgets as well   We have already raised our initial funding goal to US$160,000 with over 4,000 backers at Wadiz (The no. 1 crowdfunding platform in South Korea.) that ended on March 9th, 2021.

IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY & FUN​


 
OKAMI AT GLANCE

 
WFH? WE GOT YOU COVERED

 

 

 
The main difference you will notice between the Okami and other iPad stands is that there are no mechanical parts or hinges of any kind. Our team has created a timeproof design, that won't weaken after prolonged usage.
 We chose not to be a part of the trend towards planned obsolescence and believe that it's the designers' responsibility to develop for you, a long-lasting product.   The wide size of the base of Okami is the same length as the iPad itself, a considerable advantage in terms of stability.  The aim was to make a reliable and worry-free stand. We want to solve a problem, without creating another: elevating an iPad from your desk, without the stress of having it fall. The elevation of the screen with Okami™ reaches a remarkable 8.5cm / 3.3 inch. This is about 4x the elevation you get with Apple's Magic Keyboard.   Once in place, you will discover that Okami looks very similar to a tiny iMac, only transportable. All you need is to attach your keyboard and mouse and you have a portable computer with you always, wherever you want.   We've done months of testing and trials to find the best degrees of inclinations & the right strength of the magnets.  Every element is carefully planned, with nothing left to chance. For the inner body, we have used the toughest material possible: a layer of fibreglass thatwon't bend or break even under stress. On the exterior, we've selected a water-resistantfinish, with a soft to touch lining in the inner side. From the vocabulary.  ""Functionality: the quality of being suited to serve a purpose well; practicality.""  This has been a prerogative in Okami's design process since day one, none the less was to be quick and easy to use.  Our main objective was to increase the functionality of your iPad whilekeeping a quick, easy setup. After just a couple of times of using Okami, our team noticedthat the action of unfolding and assembling became an unconscious routine. We are surethat you will enjoy the ease of the “Fold & Play”!  A laptop's screen is attached to the keyboard, whether you like it or not. An iPad doesn't have the same design constraint! So why not make it more comfortable? Even a little discomfort while working can become very annoying when you spend hours in that position.  With users’ screen time increasing globally, sitting in the same position forwork or leisure can bad for your posture and the smallest discomfort can turn intosomething much worse over time.  Through raising your screen with a stable base, Okamitakes care of you and brings relief to your neck and shoulders, improves your posture, whichcan also increase your productivity.  With only 6 mm of thickness added when folded, the benefits that Okamibrings are inversely proportional to its dimensions. iPad stands are usually ""another thing tocarry"". While Okami is hidden when folded (while providing protection) and will not take upextra space in your bag.          iPad Air 2020iPad Pro 11"" (1st generation) 2018iPad Pro 11"" (2nd generation) 2020iPad Pro 12.9"" (3rd generation) 2018iPad Pro 12.9""  (4th generation) 2020iPad Pro 12.9"" (5th Generation) 2021

Anna is a filmmaker and Eli is a Project Engineer. She came up with the idea in 2019 when she’d had enough with the lint covered Velcro stuck onto the back of her multiple laptops and hard drives. Working in the camera department on a Netflix film, she noticed the unsightly staple being used regularly to organize equipment. Keeping up with Velcro was messy, and she knew there had to be a better way to secure the essential hard drives she was managing. Eli was months away from finishing a mechanical engineering degree. Not only did her younger brother have knowledge in CAD software, but also after-hours access to the university’s 3-D printer. Anna got to work sketching and taking online classes in product research and development, and within months came up with a design ready for printing. During the process, she invited Eli’s feedback and discovered she’d found a partner for the ride.<br/><br/>Anna and Eli Jay’s ingenuity comes from a practical understanding of how frustrating messy workspaces and dangling accessories are for all of us. With the Indiegogo community’s support, and a product they believe in to make it to the finish line, DriveSlide will soon be a laptop accessory staple. </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601559089/gfu3afqu3h0jlyjmowtr.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>Our passion - okay, obsession - comes from a true understanding of how frustrating a messy desk and dangling accessories are.

Anna is a filmmaker and Eli is a Project Engineer. She came up with the idea in 2019 when she’d had enough with the lint covered Velcro stuck onto the back of her multiple laptops and hard drives. Working in the camera department on a Netflix film, she noticed the unsightly staple being used regularly to organize equipment. Keeping up with Velcro was messy, and she knew there had to be a better way to secure the essential hard drives she was managing. Eli was months away from finishing a mechanical engineering degree. Not only did her younger brother have knowledge in CAD software, but also after-hours access to the university’s 3-D printer. Anna got to work sketching and taking online classes in product research and development, and within months came up with a design ready for printing. During the process, she invited Eli’s feedback and discovered she’d found a partner for the ride.Anna and Eli Jay’s ingenuity comes from a practical understanding of how frustrating messy workspaces and dangling accessories are for all of us. With the Indiegogo community’s support, and a product they believe in to make it to the finish line, DriveSlide will soon be a laptop accessory staple.   Our passion - okay, obsession - comes from a true understanding of how frustrating a messy desk and dangling accessories are. DriveSlide is a seamless and easy to use attachment, no matter where you’re working. External hard drives have become a place where you store pictures of your favorite memories, scripts for that new movie you want to produce, and everything else in between—and DriveSlide does not take that job lightly.Our goal is to raise funds to start the first round of manufacturing. Transparency is our number one policy.  We’ve worked hard to align ourselves with experienced vendors and manufacturers, that doesn’t make us immune to hitches along the way. COVID-19 has created a unique challenge within itself, but be assured, we are here for the long haul and will work tirelessly to stay on track.

<p style=""text-align: right;"">Hello everyone ...</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">My name is Marsio Salcuni, and I am a lover of <strong>Music, Physics and Magnetism, and one day, I got the idea of ​​combining these three things in my own way!</strong> And I must admit that it didn't go badly ... That idea gave me the opportunity to build my first <strong>X-PICK</strong>, and start having fun experimenting and playing. As you can see from the videos, however, I started to understand that it was much more important than just having fun ... I discovered that it <strong>is a set of everything a guitarist or bassist should have always with him</strong> ... All enclosed in a little Gem!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Like a ... <strong>Swiss Army Knife</strong> ... made especially for Musicians, <strong>which combines a multitude of objects, which usually a guitarist buys and uses separately</strong> ... In addition to the fact that it gives us the possibility <strong>to do many things that could not be done in any other way, if not with the X-Pick </strong>... Like <strong>Playing with Magnetic Fields</strong>!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>I apologize for the guitar or Bass performances</strong>, but in my defense, I delight more in singing, and this strengthens my desire to see the X-PICK in the hands of REAL GUITARISTS or BASS PLAYERS, to see the thousand other facets that they are able to discover (moreover because each of you has different instruments, amplifiers, settings, etc ... and being Magnetic Fields, they will always be different, with different results, different sounds, etc)</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Each of you will contribute to the growth of the X-Pick's capabilities, and yours! </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Because you will have 1000 more ways to MAKE MUSIC! </strong></p>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607957886/tovocyvj431mkquzmij5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The X-PICK has a size of <strong>24 mm x 25 mm, </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607958689/zlkxefav5n1gyfljwa2z.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>a thickness of<strong> 4 mm</strong> and has a <strong>well-defined tip, but with a very wide angle (90° in Axial Position)</strong>, such as to facilitate simple picking or normal fast picking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607958708/lpiqckyhe3dobyarpvpo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The <strong>DESIGN</strong>, combined with the type of <strong>MAGNETIZATION</strong>, never creates problems of too much attraction towards the strings ... The maximum magnetic degree, is poured only on the faces of the magnet as Physics teaches us, and strong enough, but calculated, on the back of the X-Pick to use magnetic field modulation techniques! ... It is obvious, for example, that the bass strings suffer more attraction, given their thickness, but this in no way prevents the fast and precise picking, as you have seen from the videos because you can take advantage also of a <strong>Magnetic Trick</strong>, to improve Normal Picking and Fast Picking:</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609194510/cdijoblf8q3nzfantpgd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Exactly at the tip</strong>, at the union between the <strong>North</strong> and <strong>South</strong> magnetic fields, <strong>there is no attraction with the iron strings</strong>, but an imperceptible, but decisive repulsive force is felt, which facilitates the Picking, as if the string were thrown.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The reason is that the iron atoms of the string, being close to both polarities almost simultaneously (i.e. picking) do not have time to reorient themselves for the attraction, and combined with the fact that the power of magnetism always focuses on the faces of a magnet, I opted for axial magnetization that collides the opposite magnetic fields, right in the tip, and I created this kind of magnetism game to facilitate and speed up the movement of the pick ...</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>The rear corners are cut</strong> in order to facilitate the use of some particular techniques, <strong>and ensure the right degree of magnetism in the interaction between magnetic fields with the Pickups.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607958782/o7vrhrgrbgrh90abbitl.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>It has very smooth lateral surfaces to slide on the strings like a slide</strong> would and the back is the one that has the most magnetic degree, because it is the widest, suitable for all the innovative techniques that require magnetic field modulations of the pick-ups of the instruments</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p><strong>The direction of magnetization of the pick is AXIAL</strong>, in such a way as to adapt to any type of polarity of the pick ups on the market</p>

<h3>SLIDE</h3>
<p>A Wonderfull Slide, again thanks to Neodymium, which guarantees a <strong>Great Sustain</strong>! But also under another aspect: <strong>Finally you will use the Slide with the right hand in an agile way</strong>, <strong>leaving the left free to put chords</strong>, managing to act even only on the single note !!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">PICK – TAPPING or ""TAPPICK""</h3>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">The Pick that will allow you to <strong>give a brilliant and perfect note just to contact, without having to press the string on the fret like a Viking</strong>, like with normal picks! In fact, it makes <strong>the notes shine even where there is no guitar fretboard</strong>, so much that you will use it for magnificent and wild tapping, where no one has gone before!</p>

<p><strong>(POWER &amp; ETERNAL SUSTAIN)</strong></p>
<p><strong>ELECTRIC VIOLIN</strong>: Only sliding on the string gently, with the back or side of the X-Pick; HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HOPED THAT YOUR BENDING WILL LAST IN ETERNAL GARY MOORE STYLE ???? ... NOW YOU CAN DO IT TOO !!! ALSO RECOMMENDED FOR LESS EXPENSIVE AND PERFORMING GUITARS !!</p>
<p><strong>OCTAVER</strong>: Just slipping on the string with the back of the pick, <strong>adds more than an octave to the traditional guitar fretboard</strong> with a bright and powerful sound!</p>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>THE TECHNIQUE BORN WITH THE X-PICK,</strong> that will allow you to play without touching the strings, and to interact <strong>only through magnetic fields!</strong> In this case the change in polarity of the magnetic field acts (Attraction/Repulsion), because the movement of the pick is right - left with respect to the string ...</p>

<h3>MAGNETIC FIELDS TREMOLO</h3>
<p><strong>OTHER X-PICK TECHNIQUE</strong>, which differs from Hyper Picking, because the movement of the Pick with respect to the strings is up and down, that is, close to and away from the string quickly.

<h3>MANY EFFECTS</h3>
<p>In addition to the one shown above, and that you could see from the videos, you must keep in mind that <strong>the combinations of use of the X-Pick are infinite</strong> ... I am talking about the all different instruments we have, and therefore with different magnetic fields, completely new results , or used together with different pedals, amplifiers of various brands and powers, and I could go on forever as you well know… <strong>SO IT'S A NEW WORLD TO BE COMPLETELY DISCOVERED BY EACH OF YOU !!!</strong></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: right;""><strong>On Technical Level</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">When you'll playing with the X-Pick, you will not hear those annoying hums due to too high gain or too open tones or exaggerated volumes ... This happens because the X-Pick, being made of ferrous material and magnetic, in contact with the strings, <strong>IMPROVE THE GROUNDING SYSTEM OF THE INSTRUMENT,</strong> <strong>closing better the mass that makes the usual turn in your body only from the left hand; a round of Grounding that is usually stopped by the normal picks of non-conducting material ...</strong></p>

<h2><strong>On Philosophical Level</strong></h2>
<p>And for this I have to go a little personal ... Well, I'm one of those who sweated with work and the few savings his Gibson Les Paul Studio, and this desire to have it, created a bond ... let's say I'm one of those who believe that every instrument has a <strong>SOUL</strong>, a <strong>CONSCIENCE</strong>, and an OPINION to express… And when I play, I speak to her! <strong>SHE TALK TO ME</strong>! ...</p>
<p><strong>So why not give maximum voice to this essence?</strong></p>

<p>I tried to make the X-Pick by myself, like the ones you see in the videos… I made them all by hand with the cutter; but there is a problem ... <strong>If magnets reach a critical heat point, they lose a lot of their magnetism, and with the cutter or any other tool, that point is far surpassed!</strong> ... And it is for this reason that I am collaborating with a magnet manufacturers, to have my custom Mold Patent (pending) made ... It is the only way for the moment, at least until I can afford to open a business independently ...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this company need a substantial amount of X-PICK to give me an advantageous quote, for various reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The first is <strong>the cost of the material</strong>, the more it is, the less they pay for it too;</li>
<li>The Second is for all instruments and processes <strong>for magnetization to grade N52</strong>;</li>
<li>The third and most expensive is <strong>the mold created specifically for this Patent</strong>; of which they asked me to contribute with the cost of the realization, because the company cannot use it for any other purpose ... </li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, the products that I will ship, will be produced with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MAGNETIC CERTIFICATION</strong></li>
<li><strong>ALL THE SAME AND PERFECT, THANKS TO THE MOLD,</strong></li>
<li><strong>WITH A COATING AGAINST WEAR, AND TO IMPROVE THE GRIP BETWEEN THE FINGERS,</strong></li>

<p>As I said before, I managed to create my first X-Pick by myself, but with consequent loss of magnetism ... In fact, to work the so-called permanent rare earth magnets with high magnetic potential, <strong>you need a lot of machinery, expensive machinery</strong>, that only a company already started and that does only this can have.</p>
<p><strong>I do not have the presumption of wanting to open a magnet company immediately</strong>, but simply to collaborate with one of these companies, so that they develop a special mold of my patent and provide to magnetization and coating. By proceeding in this way, I will be able to start creating a way forward, because <strong>Rome wasn't built in a day!</strong> And I tell you as an Italian! That's it! …</p>

Don't worry! Here's the New Active Campaign:
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/x-pick-no-magic-just-science--3#/

 
   

 

Hello everyone ...
My name is Marsio Salcuni, and I am a lover of Music, Physics and Magnetism, and one day, I got the idea of ​​combining these three things in my own way! And I must admit that it didn't go badly ... That idea gave me the opportunity to build my first X-PICK, and start having fun experimenting and playing. As you can see from the videos, however, I started to understand that it was much more important than just having fun ... I discovered that it is a set of everything a guitarist or bassist should have always with him ... All enclosed in a little Gem!
Like a ... Swiss Army Knife ... made especially for Musicians, which combines a multitude of objects, which usually a guitarist buys and uses separately ... In addition to the fact that it gives us the possibility to do many things that could not be done in any other way, if not with the X-Pick ... Like Playing with Magnetic Fields!
I apologize for the guitar or Bass performances, but in my defense, I delight more in singing, and this strengthens my desire to see the X-PICK in the hands of REAL GUITARISTS or BASS PLAYERS, to see the thousand other facets that they are able to discover (moreover because each of you has different instruments, amplifiers, settings, etc ... and being Magnetic Fields, they will always be different, with different results, different sounds, etc)
Each of you will contribute to the growth of the X-Pick's capabilities, and yours! 
Because you will have 1000 more ways to MAKE MUSIC! 


The X-PICK has a size of 24 mm x 25 mm, 

 
a thickness of 4 mm and has a well-defined tip, but with a very wide angle (90° in Axial Position), such as to facilitate simple picking or normal fast picking.
 

 

The DESIGN, combined with the type of MAGNETIZATION, never creates problems of too much attraction towards the strings ... The maximum magnetic degree, is poured only on the faces of the magnet as Physics teaches us, and strong enough, but calculated, on the back of the X-Pick to use magnetic field modulation techniques! ... It is obvious, for example, that the bass strings suffer more attraction, given their thickness, but this in no way prevents the fast and precise picking, as you have seen from the videos because you can take advantage also of a Magnetic Trick, to improve Normal Picking and Fast Picking:
 

 
Exactly at the tip, at the union between the North and South magnetic fields, there is no attraction with the iron strings, but an imperceptible, but decisive repulsive force is felt, which facilitates the Picking, as if the string were thrown.
The reason is that the iron atoms of the string, being close to both polarities almost simultaneously (i.e. picking) do not have time to reorient themselves for the attraction, and combined with the fact that the power of magnetism always focuses on the faces of a magnet, I opted for axial magnetization that collides the opposite magnetic fields, right in the tip, and I created this kind of magnetism game to facilitate and speed up the movement of the pick ...
The rear corners are cut in order to facilitate the use of some particular techniques, and ensure the right degree of magnetism in the interaction between magnetic fields with the Pickups.

 
It has very smooth lateral surfaces to slide on the strings like a slide would and the back is the one that has the most magnetic degree, because it is the widest, suitable for all the innovative techniques that require magnetic field modulations of the pick-ups of the instruments
 
The direction of magnetization of the pick is AXIAL, in such a way as to adapt to any type of polarity of the pick ups on the market

 

 


The X-Pick is made with material named NEODYMIUM, from the category of Rare Earth Permanent Magnets; is chemically composed with NdFeB (Neodymium-Iron-Boron) and has the highest degree of magnetism that exists: N52. 
It have a Coating named (Ni-Cu-Ni- Epoxy) that is, a Nickel-Copper-Nickel composition and a final layer of Epoxy Resin to give more grip in contact with the fingers, as well as for protection from wear …
 
MAGNETIC FIELDS (with iron powder):


 
POLARITY (with a compass):
  


""X- PICK""
ALL IN NEODYMIUM N52
THE ONLY MAGNETIC PICK OF ALL TIMES
+
ROUND PLASTIC CASE
TO PROTECT THE X-PICK AND
ALWAYS CARRY IT WITH YOU !!
 



""X- PICK""
ALL IN NEODYMIUM N52
THE ONLY MAGNETIC PICK OF ALL TIMES
+
WOODEN DISPLAY BOX
​TO SHOW IT IN ALL ITS SPLENDOR: 
- AT YOUR HOME, 
- WHERE YOU PLAY WITH YOUR BAND, 
- IN THE SHOWCASE OF YOUR SHOP, 
- OR FOR A PHANTASMAGORIC
 GIFT TO GIVE TO A MUSICIAN !!
 
 
 
IT IS COMPOSED BY:
 
- A WOODEN DIPLAY BOX
- VELVET BEARING
- NON-SLIP MAGNET
WHICH ALLOWS THE X-PICK TO REMAIN
ERECTED FOR EXPOSURE, IN FRONT OF
THE LOGO THAT IS ALSO PRESENT INSIDE ... 
+
    
AND IN ADDITION WITH THE CHOICE ""EXPO"" 
YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE ""TACTICAL"" CASE
TO PROTECT THE X-PICK AND TAKE IT WITH YOU
 


 


Describing what happens, when it bring the X-Pick closer and away from the pick up of the instrument, there is a field modulation of the electromagnetic coils, with consequent change of shape, direction and intensity of the magnetic field between the X-Pick and the pick ups, to produce a different sound than usual ...
Using the X-Pick, you can change, IN REAL TIME: THE POSITION, THE SHAPE, THE POWER, THE INTENSITY of the GUITAR/BASS PICKUPS, which will have their fixed magnetic field, modulated by a magnetic brother who moves on them!
AS IF YOU CREATED A DIFFERENT PICKUP FOR EVERY PICK POSITION, ADAPTABLE TO EVERY KIND OF NEED:
 
 
PLECTRUM
New approach in the use of the Pick, with the use of the Magnetic Trick explained above, to improve control and speed up the Pick

​

 
BODY & CRISTALLINITY OF SOUND
Crystallinity and Body of Sound thanks to this innovative material, the Neodymium, which makes it seem to ALWAYS PLAY WITH NEW STRINGS!

 
SLIDE
A Wonderfull Slide, again thanks to Neodymium, which guarantees a Great Sustain! But also under another aspect: Finally you will use the Slide with the right hand in an agile way, leaving the left free to put chords, managing to act even only on the single note !!

 
PICK – TAPPING or ""TAPPICK""
The Pick that will allow you to give a brilliant and perfect note just to contact, without having to press the string on the fret like a Viking, like with normal picks! In fact, it makes the notes shine even where there is no guitar fretboard, so much that you will use it for magnificent and wild tapping, where no one has gone before!

 
BRUSHES EFFECT
Sound produced only by the magnetic fields, bringing the pick closer to the Pick Up, and making them pass the strings, one by one or all together to create the rolls

 
MAGNETIC FIELDS DELAY
Delay of any kind of sound you want; Just one touch on the note or chords, like the classic pedalboards, and then you have Total Control over the Delay ... You'll be able to slow down or speed up the delay, accentuate it, change the sound in real time ... 

 
ELECTRIC VIOLIN & OCTAVER
(POWER & ETERNAL SUSTAIN)
ELECTRIC VIOLIN: Only sliding on the string gently, with the back or side of the X-Pick; HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU HOPED THAT YOUR BENDING WILL LAST IN ETERNAL GARY MOORE STYLE ???? ... NOW YOU CAN DO IT TOO !!! ALSO RECOMMENDED FOR LESS EXPENSIVE AND PERFORMING GUITARS !!
OCTAVER: Just slipping on the string with the back of the pick, adds more than an octave to the traditional guitar fretboard with a bright and powerful sound!

 
HYPER PICKING
THE TECHNIQUE BORN WITH THE X-PICK, that will allow you to play without touching the strings, and to interact only through magnetic fields! In this case the change in polarity of the magnetic field acts (Attraction/Repulsion), because the movement of the pick is right - left with respect to the string ...

 
MAGNETIC FIELDS TREMOLO
OTHER X-PICK TECHNIQUE, which differs from Hyper Picking, because the movement of the Pick with respect to the strings is up and down, that is, close to and away from the string quickly. In this case there is Compression of Magnetic Fields (Only Repulsion) TECHNIQUE THAT FINALLY WILL MAKES TREMOLO POSSIBLE EVEN ON LEVER-LESS GUITARS!

 
REVERSE / ROTARY
Technique that thanks to the magnetic fields, will gives us the possibility of having these effects even without a pedal board ... How many times have you brought the effects pedals to an evening of the band, to use them in a single song?

 
EPIC ATTACK: ""THE GOD OF ROCK"" 
Versatile and Innovative Pick Attack thanks to Neodymium, and speaking personally, it is one of the most exciting things this little treasure will makes with your support!

 
ULTRA MAGNETIC CONVENIENCE
You will be able to magnetically attach your X-Pick wherever you want thanks to the high magnetic degree: to an iron necklace, a bracelet, a belt, a ring, near any small iron part or small part of the same guitar as I did in the video, and speed up your changes from accompaniment to solo! 

 
MANY EFFECTS
In addition to the one shown above, and that you could see from the videos, you must keep in mind that the combinations of use of the X-Pick are infinite ... I am talking about the all different instruments we have, and therefore with different magnetic fields, completely new results , or used together with different pedals, amplifiers of various brands and powers, and I could go on forever as you well know… SO IT'S A NEW WORLD TO BE COMPLETELY DISCOVERED BY EACH OF YOU !!!

 
HANG OBJECTS
Hang a sheet on the refrigerator, Hang a screwdriver or hammer, Hang up the cell phone, ...

 
LEARN SCIENCE
With a Magnet so strong, it will be easier to learn the rules of magnetism at school, at home, anywhere ...

 
MAGNETIZE OBJECTS
Such as Screwdrivers, screws, Knives, paper clips, etc ...



On Technical Level
When you'll playing with the X-Pick, you will not hear those annoying hums due to too high gain or too open tones or exaggerated volumes ... This happens because the X-Pick, being made of ferrous material and magnetic, in contact with the strings, IMPROVE THE GROUNDING SYSTEM OF THE INSTRUMENT, closing better the mass that makes the usual turn in your body only from the left hand; a round of Grounding that is usually stopped by the normal picks of non-conducting material ...

 
On Philosophical Level
And for this I have to go a little personal ... Well, I'm one of those who sweated with work and the few savings his Gibson Les Paul Studio, and this desire to have it, created a bond ... let's say I'm one of those who believe that every instrument has a SOUL, a CONSCIENCE, and an OPINION to express… And when I play, I speak to her! SHE TALK TO ME! ...
So why not give maximum voice to this essence?

LET YOUR GUITAR OR BASS EXPRESS, IN NEW WAYS, WITH SOUNDS THAT HAVE NEVER HEARD OR PRODUCED, WITH NEW TECHNIQUES ... NEW VIBRATIONS !! ...



 
A simple Pick?
 



I tried to make the X-Pick by myself, like the ones you see in the videos… I made them all by hand with the cutter; but there is a problem ... If magnets reach a critical heat point, they lose a lot of their magnetism, and with the cutter or any other tool, that point is far surpassed! ... And it is for this reason that I am collaborating with a magnet manufacturers, to have my custom Mold Patent (pending) made ... It is the only way for the moment, at least until I can afford to open a business independently ...
Unfortunately, this company need a substantial amount of X-PICK to give me an advantageous quote, for various reasons:

The first is the cost of the material, the more it is, the less they pay for it too;
The Second is for all instruments and processes for magnetization to grade N52;
The third and most expensive is the mold created specifically for this Patent; of which they asked me to contribute with the cost of the realization, because the company cannot use it for any other purpose ... 

In fact, the products that I will ship, will be produced with:

MAGNETIC CERTIFICATION
ALL THE SAME AND PERFECT, THANKS TO THE MOLD,
WITH A COATING AGAINST WEAR, AND TO IMPROVE THE GRIP BETWEEN THE FINGERS,

WITHOUT THE MINIMAL DEFECT OR IMPERFECTION!​


After the success of the Campaign on another Platform, and thanks to many people who believed in this project (and whom I thank again from the heart), I was able to raise enough money to:
- Have a first collaboration with a Magnet Company;
- Start doing Mold tests:
VERSION N.1 (Brown Resin test mold)
VERSION N.2 (Brown Resin test mold)
 
FINAL VERSION (White Resin Test Mold)

NOW EVERYTHING IS READY FOR PRODUCTION!
At the end of the campaign, all it have to do is indicate a quantity to produce!
Subsequently, I will personally arrange for packaging and shipping, because I want to be SURE that everything I have shown and promised is completely respected!
I am doing my best to make my little dream come true but I would need some of your help ... 
 

As I said before, I managed to create my first X-Pick by myself, but with consequent loss of magnetism ... In fact, to work the so-called permanent rare earth magnets with high magnetic potential, you need a lot of machinery, expensive machinery, that only a company already started and that does only this can have.
I do not have the presumption of wanting to open a magnet company immediately, but simply to collaborate with one of these companies, so that they develop a special mold of my patent and provide to magnetization and coating. By proceeding in this way, I will be able to start creating a way forward, because Rome wasn't built in a day! And I tell you as an Italian! That's it! …
Things start small, and if you've read this far, I'm sure you'll help me take a small step !!
I'll thank you forever!
GOOD MUSIC WITH OR WITHOUT X-PICK
But it's better with :-)

</div></div>","Notes of Shipping Fees.Due to the global freight rate has risen so much that we have to increase the freight cost per order, which will increase between $12-$20 according to different countries. After the purchase is completed, we will collect the increased shipping fees through surveys. Thanks for all the support! We provide you multi-functional dog handles with built-in LED, water tank, poop bag storage and TWO training modes with a new training collar. Solve all the problems you may have, make your time with your dog more harmonious.    

 
    For Sound Training Mode, Dogs can recognize certain sounds and tones and learn how to react to them. For example, your dog knows what the doorbell ringing means and how to react to it. Through repetition, dogs will learn what a specific sound or tone means and be able to react to it appropriately.With sound training, you can easily overlay an audible sound over a known (or learning) verbal command and quickly teach your dog commands like ""sit,"" ""stay,"" and ""heel."" Our GoGoLeash Training System has a maximum range of about 650 feet.   Vibration collars are often suggested for hearing-impaired dogs or those who simply refuse to listen. When using vibration training, you want the collar to fit snugly enough for the dog to feel the vibration but not tightly. You should be able to put 1-2 fingers between the collar and your dog's neck.Vibration is a safe and humane way to work with dogs of any size to help train them, praise them, and correct behavior. Both training modes can be used to give your pup a warning, give them praise, or as a silent command depending on how you choose to train your dog. When using any training tools, experts recommend you use verbal commands first and then training tools to reinforce the commands, and reward positive behavior with treats. Training tools are cues for your dogs - not a consequence or punishment. The leash handle has a water bowl and water tank that holds 150 ml of water so your pup can quench their thirst anywhere.  You can easily remove the water tank when you have a short trip.  We included a built-in storage area to hold up to 15 waste bags with an easy-tear dispenser. We get it..If you worried about running out of waste bags, since we design it as a universal type, you can easily buy refills online.  Incorporated LED lights in the leash handle AND on your dog’s collar to keep you and your pup safe at night or in low-light conditions.For training modes, internal channel switching allows you to switch from one dog to another (maximum 4 dogs at the same time) to easily use their preferred training method only on them.  GoGoLeash handle have super bearing capacities up to 100 kg / 220 pounds and you can walk up to 5 small dogs with one leash handle.  Our training collar can be attached to your dog's harness. Whether your dog wears a Small, Medium or even Extra-Large harness, it can be perfectly matched.Many of you told us that you wanted a retractable leash. We initially thought we would work on integrating it for the next version, but with the efforts of our design team, we’re super happy to announce that we’ve created a retractable leash add-on that will be available to ship with GoGoLeash! The length of it is 1.3-1.5m. Our backers can add it during the post-campaign survey!   The GoGoLeash is also compatible with regular Car Seat Belt Buckles to keep your dogs safe and secure in your vehicle. We use 1.3 to 1.8 meters of adjustable reflective leash with universal buckle, you can easily tie it to your dog's harness.

First-generation implementation achieves data rates from 4 Gbit/s, but the core technology allows theoretical data rates as high as 25 Gbit/s (compared to 10.2 Gbit/s for HDMI 1.3 and 21.6 Gbit/s for DisplayPort 1.2), permitting WirelessHD to scale to higher resolutions, color depth, and range.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603851713/rjbjri9k9kdeqgwiaoh7.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603871200/l57htaczmhsobdrydsfo.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>We know many others cabled/wired portable monitors.

Other than that, it stays on the green level, which means the fan doesn’t generate excessive noise at all.  Dual OSWith our 1050MB/s high transfer speed and fully saturating the USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface, having a SPEEDSSD is like having a Windows-to-go, you’ll be running Windows on MAC right from the SPEEDSSD drive, without occupying extra internal storage space on your computer.  WarrantyA 5-year warranty is provided with each purchase of SPEED SSD’s M.2 SSD Memory* , any physical damages to the enclosure and PCB are eligible for warranty.*Physical damage to M.2 SSD Memory will not be warranted Risks and challengesEven as a start-up founded in 2018, we still have our competitive advantage - our founder has worked in one of the largest electronic company in China with over 20 years of experience and our team of product designers have their fair share of experience in the manufacturing industry. These give us an edge in sticking to the deadlines during production and maintain timely delivery in September and October. Our product has a lot of new features, yet the design and innovation have been tested to be achievable and practical in mass production. If any problems arise during the process, we will keep our backers informed with updates on the issues and our solutions.",18.0,2,"1 Campaign

The first one is to cultivate a more focused habit and working environment. The second one is to be eco-friendly.Regarding focus, the ability to be moved and swiped at will of Mover Erase enables us to make choice. Throughout the process, we can learn to prioritize important actions and let go of unimportant ideas.Regarding eco-friendly, when writing something does not just happen on a piece of A4 or memo paper (throw it away after one time usage), but can be reused for many years, the waste of resources can be greatly reduced.

Secure Your Files with a Touch
The VAVA Portable SSD Touch utilizes the world's most advanced encryption technology - AES 256-bit hardware encryption, which keeps your data secure and unbreachable. The fingerprint reader adds an extra biometric layer of security to data on the drive. Unlock using fingerprint authentication or user-generated passwords.


Register up to 10 Fingerprints
With the capacity for 10 team members’ fingerprints, collaborating on projects has never been easier.
 
LED Status Indicator
The VAVA SSD Touch features an LED light that glows when the device is in use. The light blinks blue during data transfer and red when an error occurs, so you know what your device is up to at a glance.

Transfer Your Files in a Flash 
Transfer 10GB of data in just 20 seconds with the ultra fast speeds of the USB 3.1 Gen2 VAVA SSD Touch. Featuring read/write speeds of up to 540/480MB/s, it’s 4.9x faster than standard hard disk drive (HDD).
*Speed Test on Windows PC
 
*Testing Rig: Windows 10, 64 bit, USB 3,1 Gen2
*Speed Test on MacBook Pro

*Testing Rig: MacBook Pro, 2.2GHz Intel core i7, 16GB 2400MHz PDR4. 
** Performance may vary depending on host configuration. To reach maximum transfer speeds of 540 MB/s, the host device and connection cables must support USB 3.1 Gen 2 and the UASP mode must be enabled. 
*Speed Test for Sandisk, Western Digital, and Samsung on MacBook Pro

*Testing Rig: MacBook Pro, 2.2GHz Intel core i7, 16GB 2400MHz PDR4. 
VAVA vs. Other External Storage Devices

Reduce Game Load Times by 40%
VAVA SSD Touch shortens game loading times by up to 40%. For games that require frequent loading for new areas or titles with long initial load times, using the SSD Touch saves you time and prevents game time interruption.
  
Ultra Sleek Design


Multi-Device Compatibility
The VAVA SSD Touch is compatible with PC, Mac, iPad Pro, Android devices, gaming consoles, cameras, and more. For your convenience, it comes with both USB Type C-C and Type C-A cables.

Strong and Shock Resistant 
Unlike HDDs, the VAVA SSD Touch is free of any moving parts and is more resistant to shock. Constructed of strong zinc and aluminum alloy, the SSD Touch prevents any data loss from drops up to 4 feet (1.2 meters).
 
Thermal Control  
Aluminum is a great heat conductor to keep the flash controller cool at all times. The Aluminum alloy upper case and the Zinc alloy lower case prevents overheating problems and keeps the VAVA Portable SSD Touch cool all the time. 
More Color Options
Store your data in style. The VAVA SSD Touch currently comes in two colors to complement your devices: cobalt blue and space gray,  and is available in capacities of 500GB, 1TB, and 2TB.

CNC ONE machines help to make an unlimited number of things on your own. Either to make others and yourself happy or to start a business.
 
 

CNC ONE can machine a wide range of materials at high speeds. Mill a wide variety of materials like aluminum, wood, acrylics, MDF, steel sheets, brass, PCBs, foam and carbon fiber.  CNC ONE is one of the largest CNC routers in its class. The big dimensions and high robustness allow you to mill projects in any size up to 1,000 x 1,000 x 80 mm or 39.4 x 39.4 x 3.2 in.  CNC ONE is not a toy or an average entry CNC machine. It is powerful enough to mill, and not only engrave, all commonly-used metals like aluminum, copper, brass or steel sheets.   CNC ONE is great for both personal hobby projects and massive business projects, thanks to its immense power and versatile capabilities. CNC ONE is like your first employee that you only pay once and continues to pay for itself time after time.  Even if you love working with your hands, not all products can be sold for a profit this way due to time constraints and physical complications. Instead, allow yourself to focus on the creative and fun tasks and let CNC ONE do the rest.  Increase your profit by selling customized products. Offer products in your online shop that can be personalized on any scale.  A fashion startup approached us asking for a machine to customize their stylish backpacks and fashion products. So we designed a compact engraver and CNC ONE milled it in just 8 hours! (only the spindle was made on a lathe)Other Crowdfunding campaigns sold a CNC engraver like this for €2,000 - CNC ONE made this in just a few hours, saving thousands of Euros.   

 
The main focus of other CNC manufacturers is on the machine and not the customer. The result is that it takes especially unexperienced customers a long time to surpass the CNC learning curve and to begin having fun with machining.Watch our Co-Founder Filip talk about the challenges you encounter with other CNCs and what a great customer experience looks like with CNC ONE.  Questions? Contact us here   We know that CNC machining can be a daunting topic. To prove the opposite, we developed the smoothest CNC experience for our customers. Our free CNC ONE Academy and hassle-free workflows empower even the least experienced beginners to machine beautiful projects on their very first day.  We at CNC ONE guide you by your hands from the moment your CNC journey begins until each creation is finished. We want you to have a simple, trouble-free experience with our machines. This makes CNC ONE easier to use and more fun than other CNCs. We offer our CNC ONE Academy to all our customers for free. In more than 50 video lessons, we show you how easy CNC can be. Learn everything you need to CNC machine like a Pro.   Other machines in this price class come in pieces. This means hundreds of screws, soldering cables, installing different software etc. CNC ONE comes with pre-assembled components. For you this means tightening a few screws and connecting cables. All explained in our CNC ONE Academy. And ready to run in 30 minutes.  Our workflow is optimized for you: going from an idea to the finished project is usually a lengthy process that involves multiple tasks and software programs. Each step requires a laptop and a permanent cable connection to your machine during operation.For CNC ONE, we came up with a completely new workflow. We eliminated all those unnecessary steps and optimized our machine for the best free CAD/CAM software for hobbyists and professionals: Autodesk Fusion 360. Additionally, you can upload your projects to the cloud which makes it possible to separate the design and machine process. This way, you can model your ideas in peace at home and start operations with another device when you enter your workshop. If you prefer working offline, you can easily transfer your projects via Micro SD or USB.Our CNC ONE Academy will guide you trough all the necessary steps to get the results you wanted.(You can find additional information about our software specification in the section ""Rewards"") Watch Filip explaining our easy workflow:    Our integrated open source Wi-Fi system allows you to control CNC ONE the way you like: use your smartphone, the built-in touchscreen, or wirelessly connect your laptop. You choose! No other manufacturer offers so many options to control your CNC router!  Other CNC routers are controlled by a laptop which is hard-wired to the machine via USB or parallel port. While operating, your laptop is covered in wood chips and sawdust. CNC ONE is utilizes Wi-Fi connections so that you can move your laptop freely.  Controlling CNC ONE with your smartphone is magical. Leave your laptop at home and mill your project with your own iOS or Android device.  The included touchscreen gives you full control over the machine into your hands. Move CNC ONE or start machining your projects directly at point of use. Precision is also a result of robustness. Other CNC routers use 10 mm aluminum parts or 3-5 mm steel sheet. On CNC ONE we use heavy 20 mm aluminum parts.   Our 20 mm gantry design has another advantage: CNC ONE is built to last. The strong design can bear operational errors.

For a tablet, it’s as close to perfection as you’re going to get, but it is still missing one major feature: A powerful stand&case to match its capabilities. Until now, the most portable stands and cases did not offer eye-level viewing and adjustable angles for ergonomic working. Your iPad Pro is your next computer and it deserves a well-prepared stand&case.We hope mobile working can not only be lightweight but also relaxed and comfortable. That’s why we create MOFT Float. With its innovative and patented double-hinge structure, it can elevate the screen to a suitable height with a comfortable viewing angle no matter where you are. It brings you a game-changing mobile experience while working with the iPad Pro. Most importantly, it's still lightweight as MOFT product always does.MOFT Float is crafted with a built-in stand. It remains consistent with the MOFT ""invisible design"" philosophy of providing more functions and protections while remaining the same slim design. Floatable when you need it and make it invisible when you don't. Created with our unique ""FLOAT"" design, MOFT Float can elevate your screen up to 3.15 inches. It takes home the crown of the tallest portable stand&case on the market, allowing you to work anywhere without neck and shoulder pain.   Besides the adjustable angle&height, The MOFT Float also provides 3 different modes that take your iPad Pro to the next level,  helping you use your iPad Pro in many creative ways.With Floating mode you won’t ever have to bend your neck down for hours during extended Zoom meetings, browsing the internet, or even watching Netflix. Perfect for using iPad as the second display  Quickly adjust the base to stable mode. Now you can immerse yourself in creation while enjoying a seamlessly stable experience. It is perfect for any creator who wants the most out of their iPad ProMost stand&case can't offer portrait mode. That doesn't make sense in 2020 since we need a lot of jobs done in portrait mode.

<p>Our engineers did not limit themselves to Damascus knives and brought beautiful knives like the popular Sternsteiger Titanium and Achilles Series to market. These endeavors not only helped us to understand the needs of our customers, but also provided us with the experience to improve on our original classic Damascus knife design. </p>

<figcaption>The finger guard and bolster tip designs compared</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>We completely re-engineered the finger-guard and bolster tip section of the knife in order to shorten the distance between handle and blade. This much more compact design results into a higher degree of control over the blade.</p>
<br/>
<h1>The Bolster</h1>
<p> For more pressure point and grip, a new added Bolster has been added below. </p>
<div data-caption=""               New U shaped  added forged bolster with two brass pins to right above "" data-id=""24303794"">
<figure style=""margin: 0px;"">
<img alt=""               New U shaped  added forged bolster with two brass pins to right above "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1557352004/j6jhqxtkonsvzbvgtscq.jpg"" src=""""/>
<figcaption>               New U shaped  added forged bolster with two brass pins to right above </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The new bolster is made of the same Damascus steel and is held in place with two brass pins that are polished in a way that they optically merge with the steel.</p>
<br/>
<h1>The Blade</h1>
<p>The new blade is overall more straight than the old design. On the picture below you can see how the old blade falls off towards the edge, while our new blade offers an almost straight surface.</p>
<div data-id=""24303986"">
<figure style=""margin: 0px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1557352005/iahn4uebdbs2k2gkermy.jpg"" src=""""/>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The tapered shape of the old blade makes the knife very stable, but also inflexible. The new flatter shape gives the blade more flexibility and thanks to the new steel we don't lose anything in terms of durability.</p>
<p>In addition the new blade has been straightened with a slightly more curved belly while adding some width in the middle of the blade, providing a greater surface area for improved cuts. </p>

<figcaption>High contrast picture of the new 440 layer blade</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The biggest difference between the two series is the steel which now consists of 440 instead of 67 layers of steel. This increased amount of steel layers gives the blade much more rigidity and therefore increases the durability and lifetime of the blade.</p>
<div data-id=""24374078"">
<figure style=""margin: 0px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1557352007/q99qccalx4dvtk4hm5p4.jpg"" src=""""/>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In addition the blade itself becomes a piece of art. Our black smiths have become very creative in regards to possible patterns that can be forged into the blade and therefore making each blade a unique master piece.</p>
<h1>Handle design:</h1>
<p>The prominient but important feature is this handle, its <strong>made up of</strong> pure <strong>wallnut wood,</strong> as compared to our VG-10 series, which has an Micarta handle.</p>
<div data-caption=""    Arminius handle is more thinner &amp; plain wood compared to micarta industrial handle"" data-id=""24304030"">

<figcaption>    Arminius handle is more thinner &amp; plain wood compared to micarta industrial handle</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The handle is finished by a pure Damascus cap which compared to the basic stainless steel cap from the VG-10 series gives these knives an even better look and durability.</p>
<p>The old VG-10 series had an Oval shaped bigger Cap, where as the new Arminius series has an Egg shaped oval Damascus forged cap with a pin.</p>

Germanicum Arminius is the result of hundreds of hours in refinement of Damascus forging techniques, refinement of production technologies and design improvements on every level.



                                                     GERMANICUM ARMINIUS 





                                                         Arminius 3 pcs Set 



Our team of dedicated engineers, black smiths and designers put all their passion into this new series of Damascus knives and today we are proud to share these beautiful new knives with you.





Sternsteiger started its own production of Damascus knives back in 2015 and the companies passion for tradition and technology since then has driven the company to new innovations.



 New design on top, old design on bottom


Our engineers did not limit themselves to Damascus knives and brought beautiful knives like the popular Sternsteiger Titanium and Achilles Series to market. These endeavors not only helped us to understand the needs of our customers, but also provided us with the experience to improve on our original classic Damascus knife design. 



                                                            Arminius Germanicum 


In case you are interested to learn more about the development process of Germanicum Arminius scroll down to the development section, but let us focus for now on what we have improved based upon our original VG10 series below.



                                                                   Arminus Germanicum 












Finger-guard and bolster tip



The finger guard and bolster tip designs compared


We completely re-engineered the finger-guard and bolster tip section of the knife in order to shorten the distance between handle and blade. This much more compact design results into a higher degree of control over the blade.

The Bolster
 For more pressure point and grip, a new added Bolster has been added below. 



               New U shaped  added forged bolster with two brass pins to right above 


The new bolster is made of the same Damascus steel and is held in place with two brass pins that are polished in a way that they optically merge with the steel.

The Blade
The new blade is overall more straight than the old design. On the picture below you can see how the old blade falls off towards the edge, while our new blade offers an almost straight surface.





The tapered shape of the old blade makes the knife very stable, but also inflexible. The new flatter shape gives the blade more flexibility and thanks to the new steel we don't lose anything in terms of durability.
In addition the new blade has been straightened with a slightly more curved belly while adding some width in the middle of the blade, providing a greater surface area for improved cuts. 



Arminius on right with slight wider belly.between A - B  ( which gives it more penetrating effect)


The Steel



High contrast picture of the new 440 layer blade


The biggest difference between the two series is the steel which now consists of 440 instead of 67 layers of steel. This increased amount of steel layers gives the blade much more rigidity and therefore increases the durability and lifetime of the blade.





In addition the blade itself becomes a piece of art. Our black smiths have become very creative in regards to possible patterns that can be forged into the blade and therefore making each blade a unique master piece.
Handle design:
The prominient but important feature is this handle, its made up of pure wallnut wood, as compared to our VG-10 series, which has an Micarta handle.



    Arminius handle is more thinner & plain wood compared to micarta industrial handle


The handle is finished by a pure Damascus cap which compared to the basic stainless steel cap from the VG-10 series gives these knives an even better look and durability.
The old VG-10 series had an Oval shaped bigger Cap, where as the new Arminius series has an Egg shaped oval Damascus forged cap with a pin.



Arminius ( right )  Old Series ( left )  Plain & pure damascus handle Cap above.


The handle diameter has been trimmed making the Arminius handle thinner -tubular and easier to hold even for smaller hands. 



                                                  Handle diameter changes above


The same applies to the new handle cap as explained above.

New & verstile bread knife
The Arminius series has different blade serrations for cutting bread.

The exciting striking feature of the new Arminius Series is its completely hand-made forging production as compared to the mechnical industrial production of our old VG-10 series.



                               Arminius :  Finest pure damascus steel knife 


Since the carbon content is more in the Arminius series, its non stainless steel and have an increased tendency to oxidation process, which is a standard normal behaviour of all original historical hand forged damascus forge.






Arminius Series is an inspired historical handmade forging process as compared to our old VG-10 series which is actually done via closed die forging or impression die forging. Our bladesmiths have used same old age forging methods to have this unique series for you.

Damascus Steel & great warriors in history.

Our team has been trying to forge a knife that has the unique combination of finest elements of steel & wood. For this reason, we included the 440 layers of damascus & the wallnut wooden handles for Arminius damascus Series.

And some with cumbersome setup may let you go crazy.To make people get a flexible posture wherever they are, we realized we’d have to come up with the most convenient sit-stand desk ever.MOFT Z is a truly lightweight and versatile sit-stand desk at an affordable price. It’s designed to offer THE HEAVEY LAPTOP USER a maximum comfort with maximum freedom on location.  A Magazine-sized Desk with 4 Positions With the origami-inspired Z structure, MOFT Z provides one mode for standing and three-mode for sitting.  It helps you develop a healthy sit-stand working posture in the easiest way, keeping you active and productive all day. Working From Home with Right Postures The ultra-versatile yet like a paper-thin desk body makes it friendly to any working environment, not only to be used in the office but also at home or co-workspace.   We designed MOFT Z with a continuous one-piece structure. No tool is needed for setup. Stand it up easily when you need it, and unfold it back quickly when you don’t. Most people usually only want to take a short standing, not a giant stand on the desk all day long. As the same size as a magazine, you can store MOFT Z in any corner you like. Keep it ""invisible"" on your desk. So you won’t notice it when you don’t need it.It follows the consistent design philosophy of MOFT: unseen, unfelt, unnoticed.    
 MOFT Z is a fast-blade to open and close. It quickly switches your sit and stand posture and takes the stress off your back in seconds, letting you get a joyful and relaxing posture. Sitting all day in the office can be stressful for both your body and mind. A quick switch to standing not only helps you stretch a bit for a relaxing back, but also refreshes your mind with a different angle to see your works.  Standing ModeWhen you are standing, MOFT Z offers a natural height for your palms to rest onto the laptop, and your eyes to look at the screen with no strain or tension. Sitting ModeSurely, you would want to sit back after a short break. Does MOFT Z stop working by then? Absolutely not. We also prepared three modes to fit your own working style while sitting. The light-weight body foldable design makes MOFT Z the ONLY sit-stand desk that you can use on your laps.  
 We didn't trade thinness for durability. Apart from the rock-steady Z structure and tri-angle bottom support, We used the fibre-glass to ensure the toughness of panels and a maximum of 22-lbs weight. The magnetic flap to reinforce the frame, and the PU material to shield all the scratches and heat, while keeping everything soft and premium to touch. As thin and light as it is, you can always take MOFT Z away like grabbing a magazine and work anywhere you feel like, in anyway you feel right. You would never see a desk at the size of an iPad Pro. MOFT Z stays perfectly in your backpack. You can have a flexible working setup anywhere you go like never before. 
To complete a product is not simply fixing the structure, we want you to feel good even if you aren't actually using it. The vast coverage of PU material makes everywhere you touch feels soft and smooth to your hands. The color on the back not only adds an energetic vibe to your desktop, but also works as an indicator of how you act & use the product. A reliable structure also needs to fight the test of time, all corners and folding lines were reinforced to make sure you can always keep using it without wearing or tearing. 
 MOFT always aims to make products that all people can buy without having to worry about the steep price. A good design should be everyone’s design.  



 



 
 
 We found three biggest problems that other products have had: They were too big & heavy for such short time standing; They usually took even longer to store than the already tedious installment; They would still be there even if you don’t want to use them again.  And we got three answers as well: Small & thin enough to help you forget it’s there； Fast & easy to use just to save time; Disappear when you are done using it.But a desk is much smaller & cramped than a room, which means we must shrink the size of a chair all the way back while keeping the same rigidity & stability.We then chose fibre-glass as the basic structure for its toughness and flexibility—it restores most deformation under 60° foldings, much stronger than usual paper structure. It’s a more expensive material, but it’s more durable for the price. To enhance the basic structure support, we also used 11 built-in magnets between joints to make it even stronger, and snappier when you fold it back and forth.  People would still sit down after a standing break, that’s why we must keep the triple angles for sitting position, offering much better usability than a usual standing desk.   To wrap things up, we need to make it aesthetically minimalistic so that it looks and feels just like a MOFT product.    MOFT=Mobile Office For Travelers.We are a team dedicated to design & create products to help digital nomads to work better, healthier, more energized and focused.In 2019 we have launched MOFT Stand and MOFT X Series, receiving hundreds of thousands of support from all around the world, and a whopping $3.2million+ sales throughout the year, making them one of the best-selling stands on the market.And now we are proud to announce that MOFT Stand has won the iF Design Award! This time, we bring MOFT Z sit-stand laptop desk to you.

The Planogol process was developed by founder Lee Autore on a personal camping retreat during a time when Lee needed to transform his own story. The dreams and goals that came out of following this process led to Lee dating the woman who is now his wife and them having a beautiful baby girl.  He also had career-altering conversations with his boss about his professional life, and turned many more dreams into accomplished goals.</p>
<p>After forming the initial process, Lee hosted a few retreats with friends and ultimately decided to turn the idea into a system for the world to use.</p>

Every time someone feels better about one of their life areas, we are winning with them.

<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Where Are We in the Process?</span></h2>
<p>In 2020, Lee kicked Planogol into high gear with business strategy and planning under the guidance of an advisory team, including his Small Business Development Center (SBDC) advisor. Coming into 2021, Lee has personally invested more than $75k in the business, we have two smaller investors, a development partner lined up, some Letters of Intent (LOI), a dedicated office, and a full advisory board.  Our advisory board includes multiple entrepreneurs and previous senior executive leaders, as well as a licensed counselor, a CPA, marketing and sales leaders, and creative folks.​</p>
<p>We are a privately held business, open to investors through S.A.F.E. notes and other equity options.</p>
<p>We expect to have a released website within 1 year of investor funding (or IndieGoGo funding, if it gets that high!).</p>

<p>We've got a goal that will get everything going. If we can raise $20k, we will have enough to get the boat in the water and start rowing!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617301801/z59gfvdjtjwzozdumuxk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>$20k is our official goal, which should show enough interest in the campaign to get investors on board. It also covers the cost of getting the beanie plush and tokens out to everyone who contributes.</li>
<li>$50k is our first stretch goal. If we reach it, we will develop and start publishing a series of PDFs to walk our users through our process.  These PDFs will probably come out bi-weekly or monthly.</li>
<li>$75k as a stretch goal will allow us to actually kick off the developers on the project, and get things really rolling! As a thank you, we will double the number of Early Access Tokens for everyone who pledged up to this goal being met!</li>
<li><strong>Want more??!? We have great ideas, and we'll update when we start hitting these goals!</strong></li>
</ul>

<div><h3> </h3></div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We are starting with a $20k ask to kick the business into gear. Here's a rough breakdown of the initial and stretch goals, and how that money will be spent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Kick-Off ($20k)<ul>
<li>If this is all we get, then we'll be using some of this money to find the investors we need (if we still need investors when the campaign is over).</li>

Campaign is closed... find us on: http://www.planogol.com
Planogol is a Dream and Goal Management Tool that:

Focuses on life areas that need improvement
Adds inspiration and emotional drive to your dreams and goals
Ensuring you are working on S.M.A.R.T. goals
Guides you towards action-based progression
Facilitates you working with accountability partners
Drives you towards achievement!

Planogol is a Dream and Goal Management Tool that focuses on life areas that need improvement, adds inspiration and emotional drive to your dreams and goals, ensures you are working on S.M.A.R.T. goals, guides you towards action-based progression, facilitates you working with accountability partners and drives you towards achievement!
We are solving life imbalance (for individuals and families), business culture issues, employee retention and project management need for small businesses.
What are the basics?

A beginning-to-end system, walking you through the process above
Free to use (limited version)
Most expensive license per person is $4.99 per month

What aren’t we?

Bucket list
To-do list
List of dreams
Habit bully
Telling you what to dream about
Fitness app
Wishy-washy encouragement
Project management software
(but we have pieces of all of the above, integrated together)

 
Planogol is an all-encompassing life fulfillment system for real people, focused on changing how the world thinks about dreams and goals. The Planogol process was developed by founder Lee Autore on a personal camping retreat during a time when Lee needed to transform his own story. The dreams and goals that came out of following this process led to Lee dating the woman who is now his wife and them having a beautiful baby girl.  He also had career-altering conversations with his boss about his professional life, and turned many more dreams into accomplished goals.
After forming the initial process, Lee hosted a few retreats with friends and ultimately decided to turn the idea into a system for the world to use.
We want our success to be measured by our users achieving their dreams and goals. Every time someone feels better about one of their life areas, we are winning with them. By contributing to this project, you will be driving the work that will bring this unique set of tools to the world.

Where Are We in the Process?
In 2020, Lee kicked Planogol into high gear with business strategy and planning under the guidance of an advisory team, including his Small Business Development Center (SBDC) advisor. Coming into 2021, Lee has personally invested more than $75k in the business, we have two smaller investors, a development partner lined up, some Letters of Intent (LOI), a dedicated office, and a full advisory board.  Our advisory board includes multiple entrepreneurs and previous senior executive leaders, as well as a licensed counselor, a CPA, marketing and sales leaders, and creative folks.​
We are a privately held business, open to investors through S.A.F.E. notes and other equity options.
We expect to have a released website within 1 year of investor funding (or IndieGoGo funding, if it gets that high!).

Our team is ready to kick everything into motion, and we just need your help to start. Join the movement and help everyone to transform their story.
 
What Is Our Goal? Stretch Goals?
We've got a goal that will get everything going. If we can raise $20k, we will have enough to get the boat in the water and start rowing!


$20k is our official goal, which should show enough interest in the campaign to get investors on board. It also covers the cost of getting the beanie plush and tokens out to everyone who contributes.
$50k is our first stretch goal. If we reach it, we will develop and start publishing a series of PDFs to walk our users through our process.  These PDFs will probably come out bi-weekly or monthly.
$75k as a stretch goal will allow us to actually kick off the developers on the project, and get things really rolling! As a thank you, we will double the number of Early Access Tokens for everyone who pledged up to this goal being met!
Want more??!? We have great ideas, and we'll update when we start hitting these goals!


 
What We Need & What You Get
We are starting with a $20k ask to kick the business into gear. Here's a rough breakdown of the initial and stretch goals, and how that money will be spent.

Business Kick-Off ($20k)
If this is all we get, then we'll be using some of this money to find the investors we need (if we still need investors when the campaign is over).
We'll also be using it to create the initial rewards — the invite tokens and Planogol beanie plush toys!
The interest shown by all of you will be a great driving factor for investors!
Some money will go to intellectual property lawyers, to protect some key details of our idea.


Development of the website ($130k)
Infrastructure build and fees ($50k)
Alpha and beta testing ($200k)
Launch and initial marketing ($200k)
Mobile companion app ($200k)
Scaling to self-sufficiency ($700k)
Bringing you all of the other crazy perks / stretch goals ($500k)

<p>""The mission of CavnessHR is compelling and the company fills a real need for small businesses.  This isn’t a boutique solution for twenty-something start up founders or disrupting an existing industry by using venture-dollars to make the unprofitable possible. CavnessHR is a solution that all small businesses can take advantage of where most currently go without because they can’t afford a full-time HR person.""</p>
<p>Since meeting Jason, I have been impressed by his acumen and tenacity. He has excelled at building a brand and finding opportunities. He is pragmatic and disciplined. I have full-faith that CavnessHR will be successful under his leadership.</p>

<p>""Jason and I met a few years ago through an entrepreneur community event in Seattle called 1 Million Cups.

I’m grateful for the times he’s given me a platform to tell my story and talk about my business, as well as connected me to several opportunities. I see him doing this all the time.

<p>“Jason is one of the most customer obsessed leaders I know. Jason works vigorously to earn and maintain client trust and confidence.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Summary</h2>
<p>At CavnessHR we are building a remote, diverse and transparent company.</p>
<p>According to the SBA there are over 5M companies in the U.S with 49 or fewer people. Most of them don't have dedicated HR. An internal HR hire can be $50,000 or more per year plus benefits.</p>
<p>HR consultants, who we want to put out of business, over charge on price and under deliver on value.  Then the large HR companies are known for having horrible customer service.</p>
<p>Because of this, it is estimated that small businesses lose $27B or the equivalent of<i> </i>$10,000 per employee per year because of bad HR. It is also estimated that small business owners spend 25% of their time on HR. This time can be better spent taking care of their people, customers and building their company.</p>
<p>At CavnessHR we want to solve this through a voice enabled AI platform along with access to a dedicated HR business Partner. </p>
<p>At CavnessHR, we want to help small business owners save time and money.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>There are many challenges for us in ensuring CavnessHR will be a successful company. The failure rate for startups can be as high as 90% depending on what source you use. </p>
<p>1. An estimated 90% of new startups fail. (Source: Medium)</p>
<p>How many startups fail in the first year? Around 20%.</p>
<p>34% of startups close within their first two years.</p>
<p>Just over 50% of businesses make it to their fifth year.</p>
<p>Only 25% of businesses make it to the 15-year mark.</p>
<p>What percentage of startups become successful? Only 1 in 10 survive in the long run. </p>
<p>There are many factors that cause startups to fail. Among them are the following along with our plan to face those challenges.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Building something no one wants</strong></h2>
<p> We initially talked to 331 small business owners of which 90% said they would be open to using CavnessHR. We have continued to talk to thousands of small business owners. A majority of which believe in the concept of CavnessHR.</p>

""The mission of CavnessHR is compelling and the company fills a real need for small businesses.  This isn’t a boutique solution for twenty-something start up founders or disrupting an existing industry by using venture-dollars to make the unprofitable possible. CavnessHR is a solution that all small businesses can take advantage of where most currently go without because they can’t afford a full-time HR person.""

Making the decision to outsource this critical component of my business has not only helped me save time and money, but also helped me sleep better at night.  Jason and his team always put us first and constantly go above and beyond, without being asked to do so.

Unlike most people, Jason actually followed up and continues to support me. I’m grateful for the times he’s given me a platform to tell my story and talk about my business, as well as connected me to several opportunities. I see him doing this all the time.

Summary
At CavnessHR we are building a remote, diverse and transparent company.
According to the SBA there are over 5M companies in the U.S with 49 or fewer people. Most of them don't have dedicated HR. An internal HR hire can be $50,000 or more per year plus benefits.
HR consultants, who we want to put out of business, over charge on price and under deliver on value.  Then the large HR companies are known for having horrible customer service.
Because of this, it is estimated that small businesses lose $27B or the equivalent of $10,000 per employee per year because of bad HR. It is also estimated that small business owners spend 25% of their time on HR. This time can be better spent taking care of their people, customers and building their company.
At CavnessHR we want to solve this through a voice enabled AI platform along with access to a dedicated HR business Partner. 
At CavnessHR, we want to help small business owners save time and money.

Risks & Challenges
There are many challenges for us in ensuring CavnessHR will be a successful company. The failure rate for startups can be as high as 90% depending on what source you use. 
1. An estimated 90% of new startups fail. (Source: Medium)
How many startups fail in the first year? Around 20%.
34% of startups close within their first two years.
Just over 50% of businesses make it to their fifth year.
Only 25% of businesses make it to the 15-year mark.
What percentage of startups become successful? Only 1 in 10 survive in the long run. 
There are many factors that cause startups to fail. Among them are the following along with our plan to face those challenges.
Building something no one wants
 We initially talked to 331 small business owners of which 90% said they would be open to using CavnessHR. We have continued to talk to thousands of small business owners. A majority of which believe in the concept of CavnessHR.
Not the right team: 
Below is the CavnessHR Team - We believe we have the right team to solve this problem and provide the solution

Lack of focus and passion
Here at Cavness HR we are very focused and passionate about saving small business owners time and money. We have been working on this for a couple of years and we will continue to be devoted to this. 
Lack of marketing/sales
 We have a strong marketing effort as evidenced through our 40,000 connections/followers across social media. Plus through our podcast, The Jason Cavness Experience.
Lack of cash
This is a concern as we need cash flow to continue the build out of CavnessHR. We are working on this by having a crowdfunding campaign, increasing our sales/marketing efforts and entering numerous pitch competitions.
Not asking for help
We are big believers in asking for help and also providing help to others.
No partnerships
We have partnerships with the following organizations to provide additional value to our clients.

Ignoring user feedback

PrinCube permanent ink is the gel-based ink. It will be water-resistant and not washed away by water once the ink has dried.However, due to the smooth surface of metal, glass, plastic and other materials, and different temperature and humidity in each place, the permanent ink dries for a long time. If you are looking for faster and better long-lasting printing, you can purchase additional clear varnish spray and it can keep the color fixed.7. Are you selling the PrinCube on other places?PrinCube has no distributor partners so far and is only live on Indiegogo now, We'll ensure our Indiegogo backers are the first users that receive the PrinCube. If you do see these Scam Wesbsite and Facebook Ads, please help us to report their ads and page. We think as more people report this problem, the Facebook team will get aware of this issue! 8. How can I order extra ink if we have already purchased the printer?If you ordered the PrinCube but wants to purchase more ink cartridges, we are able to offer the additional perk for you now: The Permanent Ink: https://bit.ly/2MzvP0O; The Standard Ink: https://bit.ly/2VwBvwO. The Ink Cartridge will be sent out together with the Perk you ordered before. Thanks for your support! 9. Can this printer print on black surface? or white?PrinCube can print on Black Surface but it can not show the color perfectly if the ground color is too dark. Printing white color is not supported. 10. How can this print black if it just uses the tri color cartridge?The Black color you see in the video or campaign page is printed by the PrinCube. The cartridge prints black by combining percentages of cyan, magenta and yellow. and that's how the tri-color works. 11. Printers clean themselves periodically to avoid getting clogged, does yours?We suggest you clean the PrinCube ink outlet at least once a month. When you're not using it, it's better to put the lid on. Btw, PrinCube has the clean function, which supports you long-press the button and it will print 3 color line so you know the printing status in advance. 12. What is the shelf-life of the ink?The shelf-life of the ink cartridge is 18 months. If it is the used ink cartridge, you stored properly in the correct environment, you may still be able to use it for 18 months (15° - 30°） Risks and challengesWith our team’s years of experience with printing technology and the successful production of previous products, we have reliable suppliers and excellent manufacturing partners, making us confident in our production schedule for PrinCube. However, we understand that challenges often occur with shipping and logistics.To avoid potential delays, we have already confirmed with our suppliers that production is ready and shipping can begin on time. Our most important task is to satisfy the promises we make to our backers.If any unexpected problems arise we will keep our backers updated and informed about how we are solving the issue. We are excited to bring PrinCube to the world and thank you for your support.",62.0,7,"1 Campaign

<div>  Hello, I'm Shawn Cross. I am a born and raised Alaskan. I grew up racing motocross and snowmachines. Ultimately, I became a Power Lineman with the IBEW. It's been a fun and fast paced life. </div>
<div>  Throughout my whole life, I have been using gas cans for my hobbies and at work. Eventually, gas can companies were forced to change their designs, due to new safety regulations. Nobody can tolerate these new style cans. They are difficult to use and they pour so slowly. I'm here to change all of that! </div>
<div>  If you search on google or on youtube ""new style gas can"", what comes up is a plethora of people ranting, videos on how to modify the new fuel cans, and even where to by the old stye used gas cans, at a high price, that are well beyond the expected life of the product. This is a huge safety issue and it needs to be resolved. </div> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div><div> <p>  I have dedicated virtually every day of the past four months to get to this point. I didn't have enough time to work as a Power Lineman full-time and expect to take on this task. I put my job aside and have been budgeting on my savings. I eat, sleep, and breath this. Its safe to say I'm obsessed. That was the birth of my company<b> <a href=""hashtagonecan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#ONECAN</a></b>.</p>
<p>  Through countless hours of Research &amp; Development and multiple meetings with designers, manufacturers, attorneys and the EPA, I have come up with a cost of about $200,000 to bring this product to market.</p>
<p>  If the financial goal is not met, then I will use what I have to get as far as It will allow me and take it from there. Where there is a will, there is a way. I have a plan and failure is not a part of it. Its not a matter of if I'm going to bring this product to market, its just a matter of when.  </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>  One out of three people own a fuel can and can relate to the frustrations associated with using it. 100 Million fuel cans are in circulation in the U.S., today, and 17 Million fuel cans are purchased by U.S. consumers each year. While handling 30lbs of a highly flammable substance, its the worst time to be having complications. There are a lot of people having a lot of issues with the new fuel cans, and we need to change it.</p>
<p>  The portable fuel can regulations were put into place to create safer fuel cans. This made fuel cans much more inconvenient to use. This causes consumers to bypass the safety features of the fuel can, making it more dangerous. This entails puncturing holes in the can, removing parts, installing home-made valves or even completely removing the spout to pour directly out of the can.</p>
<p>  By creating this new and innovative fuel can, the world will be a happier and safer place, while refueling their vehicles and toys.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
  Hello, I'm Shawn Cross. I am a born and raised Alaskan. I grew up racing motocross and snowmachines. Ultimately, I became a Power Lineman with the IBEW. It's been a fun and fast paced life. 
  Throughout my whole life, I have been using gas cans for my hobbies and at work. Eventually, gas can companies were forced to change their designs, due to new safety regulations. Nobody can tolerate these new style cans. They are difficult to use and they pour so slowly. I'm here to change all of that! 
  If you search on google or on youtube ""new style gas can"", what comes up is a plethora of people ranting, videos on how to modify the new fuel cans, and even where to by the old stye used gas cans, at a high price, that are well beyond the expected life of the product. This is a huge safety issue and it needs to be resolved.  What We Need & What You Get
   I have dedicated virtually every day of the past four months to get to this point. I didn't have enough time to work as a Power Lineman full-time and expect to take on this task. I put my job aside and have been budgeting on my savings. I eat, sleep, and breath this. Its safe to say I'm obsessed. That was the birth of my company #ONECAN.
  Through countless hours of Research & Development and multiple meetings with designers, manufacturers, attorneys and the EPA, I have come up with a cost of about $200,000 to bring this product to market.
  If the financial goal is not met, then I will use what I have to get as far as It will allow me and take it from there. Where there is a will, there is a way. I have a plan and failure is not a part of it. Its not a matter of if I'm going to bring this product to market, its just a matter of when.  
    The Impact   One out of three people own a fuel can and can relate to the frustrations associated with using it. 100 Million fuel cans are in circulation in the U.S., today, and 17 Million fuel cans are purchased by U.S. consumers each year. While handling 30lbs of a highly flammable substance, its the worst time to be having complications. There are a lot of people having a lot of issues with the new fuel cans, and we need to change it.
  The portable fuel can regulations were put into place to create safer fuel cans. This made fuel cans much more inconvenient to use. This causes consumers to bypass the safety features of the fuel can, making it more dangerous. This entails puncturing holes in the can, removing parts, installing home-made valves or even completely removing the spout to pour directly out of the can.
  By creating this new and innovative fuel can, the world will be a happier and safer place, while refueling their vehicles and toys.
    Risks & Challenges   There are an array of hurdles when tackling such a large task. First of all is protection. There are the ""innovators"", the ""imitators"" and the ""wannabes"". As the innovator, I need to take every precaution possible to keep everything that I've worked so hard to achieve. Therefore I'm taking a very passive-aggressive approach. I make a plan, get everything in place, then strike while the iron is hot and keep striking.
  The designing, manufacturing and marketing are otherwise pretty straight foreword. While maintaining plasticity and being forever vigilant, these obstacles will be overcome. The people who do the difficult tasks are those who can.   Other Ways You Can Help   Contact us and follow us on hashtagonecan.com. We offer clothing with our brand on it, to help fund the mission. It also allows you to follow our progress throughout the whole process. We will also be found on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.
  It would be much appreciated if you would share, like, blog, tweet, etc. about #ONECAN. Every person makes a huge difference and is much appreciated. 
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING!

<h3>Methodology - What is under the hood?</h3>
<p>The name PAIR and all the design decisions that went into our ""Goal Oriented Week Planner"" comes from a simple formula:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475496411/qi3b6zbiypi8dct77uw0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Which really means; what ever you do, start with a solid strategy. After that take the necessary actions to meet your objectives. In the process learn from yourself and once this is all over, restart this process!</p>
<p><strong>All PAIR does, is to provide a playbook to make this happen on a weekly basis.</strong> We believe if you can deeply focus on the week ahead of you and truly get the most out of it, week after week... You can achieve your short and long term objectives.</p>
<p>The idea of short, flexible and highly dynamic iteration cycles is at the heart of Agile, Scrum and Lean Development workflows. Companies developed these techniques over the past two decades to make leading products in an environment of constant change.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475488738/kvgqqqywjlkrjdbocvyj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>PAIR takes these methodologies and applies them to our personal lives. We believe, just like companies, <strong>these techniques can also be used to help us get the most out of our everyday lives.</strong></p>
<hr/>
<h3>What is inside the Box?</h3>
<p><strong>40 week bundles! </strong> This means a 12 pages (6 sheet) week planner that you can be used standalone and easily carried wherever you go. It is probably the lightest physical planner you can get... which doesn't give up anything from it's rich content.</p>

<h3>So What is a PAIR Week Bundle?</h3>
<p><strong>Week Bundle</strong> is the 12 pages of PAIR that you will be using on a weekly basis. It covers all the pages that make up to a complete week planner and consists of the following sections:</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475705004/galgzyvkj86sgzd3bmu6.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>

<h3>Page Features of a Week Bundle</h3>
<p>In the upper section you have seen how the 12 pages PAIR is broken into their sections. But it is the detail of the individual layouts that make PAIR work! Here are each of the layouts in greater detail.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474172654/paczpvnousfdbaqekg2k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>1) Brainstorming &amp; Mind Mapping Area:  </strong>Free your mind from remembering things... and set a foundation for setting your goal buckets.</p>
<p><strong>2) Write Your Dates Yourself: </strong>Who said we need to start planning from Jan 1st? Peel off a week, name the dates and you are set to go!</p>

<p><strong>3) Goal Buckets: </strong>are chunks of actionable tasks with their respective value points.</p>
<p><strong>4) Value Points: </strong>Serves two purpose <strong>1)</strong> Motivate you to start daunting tasks <strong>2)</strong> Helps you to see your weekly capacity.</p>

<p>Construction of a prototype is not only for technological products,
but can also be for various patents and tangible ideas for a variety of forms
prior to mass production.</p>
<p>In this way, many entrepreneurs in various fields can take their
idea as a prototype to groups of investors and raise money for the project, and
create partnerships with production companies and many other useful actions.</p>
<p>In the past, one needed to seek the services of special commercial
companies to build a prototype, one with professionals that can interpret your
idea, create a graphic design and then print it in three dimensions using a
special printer that works with the 3D method for printing the prototype.</p>
<p>Because the costs to print of prototype are considered expensive, in
recent years special printers have been developed for professional use by
private consumers at prices that meet their needs.</p>
<p>Today, there are three types of 3D printers tailored to the end
consumer that can print a prototype for any use, whether it's a manufacturing
technology product, patented, electronic device or anything else.</p>
<p>

The most popular 3D printer that works on
technology is FFF. Although this type of printer is considered new in the
market, it is gaining momentum due to the fact that it uses relatively
inexpensive materials for production of a prototype. Let's look at what is
happening in the market and understand the main problem encountered when
printing a prototype with the 3D printer.<br/><br/><b style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Biggest problems with 3D printing<br/></b></p>
<div>
<b></b><p></p>
<p>Currently there are bobbins of filament suitable for use in 3D
printers. The common denominator among them is that you can use only one end of
the filament and need to thread on the head of the printer and work with it to
the point where the bobbin ends and a new bobbin needs to be replaced. This
sometimes occurs in the middle of the printing process and creates significant
economic loss.</p>
<p>The other end of the wire coil is hidden and cannot be accessed in
order to make a connection between the two wires to continue the printing
operation, creating significant damage and many losses for printers worldwide.</p>
<p>By using the new bobbin of our company, NEXTFILA, you can access the
second end of the filament of the bobbin and plug it at any stage of the
printing process using a specially developed welder. This is done at minimal
cost, thereby ensuring quality work, operation flow and significant savings of
time and money.</p>- wasted remaining filaments<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457331832/tikw2bxsktgz1bcpnrfg.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""/><br/><p></p>

<b><h3><b>FAQ</b></h3></b><ul>
<li>
<b>Why 500g(1.1lb) filament is wound in a bobbin?</b><br/><b>* Reason #1</b> - To use for more
commercialized3D printers. A size of two 500g NEXTFILAfilament assembly is
almost the same as a 1kg filament.<br/><b>* Reason #2</b> - Most filaments (especially
for a PLA) absorb humidity in the air. Therefore, its printing quality will get
lower and lower as time goes by starting with opening a vinyl pack. A 500g
filament has shorter air exposure time than a 1kg filament.<br/>
NEXTFILA’s 1kg filament box has two of 500g filaments that is individually
vacuum vinyl packed with a desiccant.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Do you sell a welder only?</b><br/>We don't sell a welder E01 only. If you want to buy the welder, please choose one of a welder packs.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Explain about your filament material(ABS,PLA).</b><br/>We had tested on
filaments from more than 10 OEM companies and had carefully selected the best
filament materials with high quality.<br/>
NEXTFILA's ABS, PLA filaments are ROHS certified and have a good printing
quality.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Will you sell welder parts individually?</b><br/>A PTFE block is a consumable part. We will sell the welder parts in our web site  after first main delivery finished.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Is there a filament except ABS, PLA in your product category?</b><br/>We are working on adding
several kinds of filaments in our production category in the future.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Yes, I see a NEXTFILA filament can connect two filaments together. But how can I connect a third filament?</b><br/>You can connect a third filament to a second filament after removing a first empty filament bobbin from a bolt(that is used to assemble two filaments together). You can connect 4th, 5th and more filaments like this way.
<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>This campaign is ""flexible funding"". What happens to my money?<br/></b>Don't worry about that. I have money to produce filaments for your orders.<br/>A main purpose of this campaign is for finding out customer needs before entering an online markets.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>You have less filament colors.<br/></b>Sorry for that. This is a very early stage of the connectable filament business. Several filament colors will be added gradually.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Heating the welder with two gas lighters seems awkward and unreliable.</b><br/>Yes. The manual welder might be inconvenience. I had been concerned about that. Which welder type might be better to individual users?<br/>A manual type? or an automatic temperature controlled type?<br/>A manual type is cheap but awkward and inconvenience, an automatic temperature controlled type is easy to use and reliable but expensive.<br/>An individual users might use 3~5kg filaments per year and this means, they might use a filament welder less than 10 times per year. So I decided a manual welder would be launched first, an automatic welder after that.<br/>An automatic temperature controlled welder will be launched sooner or later.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Why a title of this campaign is a ""connectable filament"" not a ""connectable filament spool""?</b><br/>Yes, right.<br/>My idea is based on a ""connectable bobbin"". But if I sell a bobbin itself, users have to wind their stock filament to the ""connectable bobbin"". This work is not  easy. So I decided to sell a ""filament wound connectable bobbin"".<br/>This is the reason why I set a campaign title as ""the connectable 3D printer filament"" not ""the connectable 3D printer filament spool"".</li>

<p>World's first connectable 3D printer flament</p>
</div>
</div><br/><div><br/></div></div>","Construction of a prototype is not only for technological products,
but can also be for various patents and tangible ideas for a variety of forms
prior to mass production.
In this way, many entrepreneurs in various fields can take their
idea as a prototype to groups of investors and raise money for the project, and
create partnerships with production companies and many other useful actions.
In the past, one needed to seek the services of special commercial
companies to build a prototype, one with professionals that can interpret your
idea, create a graphic design and then print it in three dimensions using a
special printer that works with the 3D method for printing the prototype.
Because the costs to print of prototype are considered expensive, in
recent years special printers have been developed for professional use by
private consumers at prices that meet their needs.
Today, there are three types of 3D printers tailored to the end
consumer that can print a prototype for any use, whether it's a manufacturing
technology product, patented, electronic device or anything else.


The most popular 3D printer that works on
technology is FFF. Although this type of printer is considered new in the
market, it is gaining momentum due to the fact that it uses relatively
inexpensive materials for production of a prototype. Let's look at what is
happening in the market and understand the main problem encountered when
printing a prototype with the 3D printer.Biggest problems with 3D printing


Currently there are bobbins of filament suitable for use in 3D
printers. The common denominator among them is that you can use only one end of
the filament and need to thread on the head of the printer and work with it to
the point where the bobbin ends and a new bobbin needs to be replaced. This
sometimes occurs in the middle of the printing process and creates significant
economic loss.
The other end of the wire coil is hidden and cannot be accessed in
order to make a connection between the two wires to continue the printing
operation, creating significant damage and many losses for printers worldwide.
By using the new bobbin of our company, NEXTFILA, you can access the
second end of the filament of the bobbin and plug it at any stage of the
printing process using a specially developed welder. This is done at minimal
cost, thereby ensuring quality work, operation flow and significant savings of
time and money.- wasted remaining filaments
- Vacantly wait until the old filaments to be all consumed to change filaments.

- Printing failure will occur because of shortage of the filament.

These problems will be solved if you can connect the old filament to the new one in advance.
NEXTFILA, the world's first connectable filament.




NEXTFILA is the world's first connectable filament. You can simply connect a
new filament to the remaining filament while printing without stopping your 3D
printer.







This can be achieved
without a highly complex mechanism.
NEXTFILA' filament is wound to our specially-designed bobbin, which makes filaments' connection
possible.


You can connect your remaining filaments to the new one using a special filament welder.After all of remaining
filament is consumed, the joint filament will naturally follow through the gap
and the new filament will start to be consumed.


Try use a NEXTFILA filament.
It enables you to work
with 3D printer using endless filaments, and it is even possible without any
printer modification and additional cost.
? You can save your money
and save the environment because there is no wastage of filament. You can completely use
the filament to the end.
? You can save your time
because you can connect a new filament to the remaining filament at any time you
want without stopping your printing job.
? You would have no
printing failure due to a lack of filament.
You can use all of these advantages just by changing your filament to a NEXTFILA filament without an additional cost.


Product Size

Check the size of a
bobbin assembly.Refer to the upper diagram whether you can use NEXTFILA
filament to your printer or not.
(The bobbin’s diameter
is 200mm(7.87in), and the width across two bobbin assembly is 86mm(3.39in). A
filament holder size of your printer has to be bigger than these sizes.)
If the assembly size is
bigger than your printer holder, you might need an extra filament holder.
NEXTFILA filaments would be used for a 3D printer that has a bobbin center hole support type holder.You may need a special holder for a 3D printer that has a bobbin flange support type holder.If you need a special holder, I recommend this ""Universal stand-alone filament spool holder (Fully 3D-printable)"" designed by Creative Tools.

If you want more smooth rotating action when you are using the Universal spool holder, use a ""bearing type rotating table adapter"" (Check our web site nextfila.com)

Filament Welder - E01



A filament welder is
needed to use a NEXTFILA filament. Therefore, we have developed a special filament
welder. This welder has very simple structure to achieve economic price point.
It doesn't have a heater, a temperature sensor, a temperature controller and a
power supply.It is simple and cheap but fully functional.
An automatic temperature controlled welder is also good and convenience but it'll be expensive than this manual welder E01.Most of normal individual 3D printer users might use less than 5kg of filament per year.In case of that, the users will use the filament welder within 10 times per year.So a cheaper welder is better than a expensive welder.
*** Welding tutorial ***
PTFE blocks are consumable parts. We will sell it individually on on-line markets after end of this campaign.
A price of PTFE blocks(without other parts) would be $15~$20.

FAQ

Why 500g(1.1lb) filament is wound in a bobbin?* Reason #1 - To use for more
commercialized3D printers. A size of two 500g NEXTFILAfilament assembly is
almost the same as a 1kg filament.* Reason #2 - Most filaments (especially
for a PLA) absorb humidity in the air. Therefore, its printing quality will get
lower and lower as time goes by starting with opening a vinyl pack. A 500g
filament has shorter air exposure time than a 1kg filament.
NEXTFILA’s 1kg filament box has two of 500g filaments that is individually
vacuum vinyl packed with a desiccant.


Do you sell a welder only?We don't sell a welder E01 only. If you want to buy the welder, please choose one of a welder packs.


Explain about your filament material(ABS,PLA).We had tested on
filaments from more than 10 OEM companies and had carefully selected the best
filament materials with high quality.
NEXTFILA's ABS, PLA filaments are ROHS certified and have a good printing
quality.


Will you sell welder parts individually?A PTFE block is a consumable part. We will sell the welder parts in our web site  after first main delivery finished.


Is there a filament except ABS, PLA in your product category?We are working on adding
several kinds of filaments in our production category in the future.


Yes, I see a NEXTFILA filament can connect two filaments together. But how can I connect a third filament?You can connect a third filament to a second filament after removing a first empty filament bobbin from a bolt(that is used to assemble two filaments together). You can connect 4th, 5th and more filaments like this way.



This campaign is ""flexible funding"". What happens to my money?Don't worry about that. I have money to produce filaments for your orders.A main purpose of this campaign is for finding out customer needs before entering an online markets.


You have less filament colors.Sorry for that. This is a very early stage of the connectable filament business. Several filament colors will be added gradually.


Heating the welder with two gas lighters seems awkward and unreliable.Yes. The manual welder might be inconvenience. I had been concerned about that. Which welder type might be better to individual users?A manual type? or an automatic temperature controlled type?A manual type is cheap but awkward and inconvenience, an automatic temperature controlled type is easy to use and reliable but expensive.An individual users might use 3~5kg filaments per year and this means, they might use a filament welder less than 10 times per year. So I decided a manual welder would be launched first, an automatic welder after that.An automatic temperature controlled welder will be launched sooner or later.


Why a title of this campaign is a ""connectable filament"" not a ""connectable filament spool""?Yes, right.My idea is based on a ""connectable bobbin"". But if I sell a bobbin itself, users have to wind their stock filament to the ""connectable bobbin"". This work is not  easy. So I decided to sell a ""filament wound connectable bobbin"".This is the reason why I set a campaign title as ""the connectable 3D printer filament"" not ""the connectable 3D printer filament spool"".

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your support to make this happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to meet the price of $280USD or below we will need to meet at least 1000 people to put their hands up and pledge a nextPaper device. This will ensure we have the $280,000 minimum goal to purchase each device and start the manufacuring process.</li>
<li>With this you will recieve the ready made product and be the first to utilize such an amazing tool you will soon find you cannot live wtihout.</li>
<li>The funds will go into development and manufacturing of the Product nothing more. We will focus our spending money on the product itself and not on marketing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will be directly responsible for launching this product :</p>
<ul>
<li>This product could change the way we see e ink devices. No more will they be in a closed system and the ability to share content and consume the world's information on a device more suited for reading will be accessible and open for all.</li>
<li>This is not out first product. Companion Ink 1 was considered a success to closed groups of people testing and re-testing the concept. It is so valuable we decided to make it even better! But this time we want to make sure its accesible to as many people as possible. hence why we need 1000 units in order to get it down to this price!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Even though we have planned this launch to a TEE for almost 12 months since Companion Ink 1, we understand that just like any other projects we have done in the past, there can be some unforeseen circumstances that could be a potential risk to both the launch date and the execution of turning this into the device we all dream of having.</p>
<p><strong>THE PARTS: </strong><br/><br/>The right PCB and the E Ink screen combination are not an easy task to marry up. It needs careful engineering and the right parts to get it right. Although our prototypes are great so far, we want to make it even better, even faster, and even more awesome to meet the standards of our backers and our supporters. Everyone is counting on this idea to be able to free the e-reader and finally innovate the E Ink space with what's important to all of us. We will not take this lightly. We feel really passionate about bringing a device that everyone will love and reading is one of our passions and believe everyone should be able to read anything in an E Ink screen un-chained and in an open environment. This means we need to get the best parts from the right suppliers. The best support and the best factory to produce it for us. This also means someone from Companion needs to stay wherever the factory is located and oversee production to make sure every little detail is met - whilst also reporting back to the community.</p>
<p><strong>LOGISTICS:</strong></p>
<p>To meet our shipping dates we need to develop a good relationship to both our suppliers and our manufacturers. Money makes the world go round as they say, so we need to meet their minimum order quantity once we have the parts list and our build requirement. Money is always an issue and a potential problem, so we have to be VERY careful where we spend it. We need to be frugal at certain points but also be able to splurge when it comes to others. We need the right balance of strategy and poise to make sure the Companion Ink has the best opportunity when it is born into this world.</p>
<p>Companion has always been about openness, and we thrive when we help each other out. This is something we can all discuss freely to make sure we get the BEST possible product at the most efficient capital that we manage to raise. With all hands on deck I have no doubt we can turn this into a pretty cool and very useful gadget.</p>

What we need: SUPPORT for building up our new workshop with CNC and sanding machines and for paying our helping hands for manufacturing. We successful passed all the steps of the product development process. 258 Backers from Kickstarter are already waiting for their individual Chef Knife. SHARP WITHOUT COMPROMISESThe blade of //SKID light and dark contains high alloyed carbon steel (1,3503). Alloyed by a high amount of chrome and tungsten we reach a hardness around 59 - 61 HRC. Traditional Japanese blacksmith use this kind of steel to create the sharpest knifes in the world. We are using a self-developed technique to connect wood and steel. The result: a food safe, durable and seamless connection. WHAT CHEFS ARE SAYINGWe build a lot of prototypes, tested our chef knife in every manner: Professional Chefs used //SKID in their kitchens, a lot of friends that are cooking enthusiasts used it more than usual in their home kitchens. THE TALK SPECS DURABILITYEvery //SKID is vacuum infiltrated with a special mixture of oil and wax to close the pores and to make the chef knife food safe. With this combination of wood and finishing we keep up the ability of self-cleaning and antibacterial properties of tannin. With the closed pores, //SKID is not getting porous and can't contain germs.oil infiltrated + hardwood + antibacterial + seamless TESTINGS

<p>Vuwable makes live streaming easy and allows individuals, groups, and organizations to stream to their own websites AND social media at the same time -- even host a permanent live stream channel on your website. Invite others to stream with you with the click of a button, so interviews are a breeze. Truly have ownership over your content by archiving your streams in the cloud or on your own desktop.

He is also the author of ""Future Marketing: Winning in the Prosumer Age"" and ""Content Rich: Writing Your Way to Wealth on the Web"".</p>

<p>Content Launch has been in the content writing space for 14 years. With 300 writers on our team, we have written for over 500 companies and 200 agencies. But content marketing has been miscommunicated to small and medium sized businesses.

Fact: There has been no content marketing tool designed for small marketing agencies, solopreneurs and other small companies. Now there is.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>We'd like to raise $25K to help us get the word out to all of the small agencies and other small businesses out there. We'll do email campaigns, social media promotions and more. We've bootstrapped and had some angel investment, but have not received any venture capital money. </p>

<li>Free subscription to our content marketing platform ($2400 value)</li>
<li>Co-marketing to our database for your offer or service (10K folks in our database)</li>

<li>I'll provide you with free content marketing and content strategy consultation for your business</li>

<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>

<p>We are also starting a non-profit, Urban Entrepreneurs (<a href=""http://www.urbanentrepreneurs.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.urbanentrepreneurs.org/</a>), which will help inner city men and women learn how to start a business.

<p>In some way, everyone is a leader.  My unique experience may just help you become a better one AND I need your help to make it a reality.</p>
<p>Using my lessons learned, I’ve cracked the code on how to get great results fast as a leader.  Having grown up in the technology boom, and, produced results by leading the most elite teams in the United State Military – there is something you’ll get out of this book that is not available anywhere else.  It'll be unique to you.  Why, it is a passion of mine to help others because the world becomes better when we have better leaders.  So, why listen to me?  Keep reading.</p>
<p><strong>Meet…me.</strong></p>
<p>My name is <i>Joshua Aultman</i> and for me, service is and has always been a family business. My great grandfather was a police Captain.  Grandfather and father, both served in elite military units.  My grandmother, mother, aunts, uncles and cousins contributed to service to other and supported other serving families from the home front.  Growing up, and still today, my family always recognized three things: family, continuous learning/improvement and service to our nation.  When I see others doing great things in these areas, I’m naturally drawn to them.  These people are my community and they become my extended family – if you are new to this world, welcome.</p>
<p>My personal military journey has made me an award-winning leader -- top 40 under 40 (in the world) for Armed Forces technology achievements.  I’m a person who has first-hand experience with multiple cultures, and I’m an avid writer - that's dangerous to the status-quo.  And let's be honest, just because it's worked in the past - doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.  This also means I have practice in making short, concise, and straight to the point messages.</p>
<p>I’ve been personally involved in major technology growth and process changes during a time of major evolutions in cyberspace, natural disasters, and worldwide pandemics.  These hard problems led to new methods of leadership applied to warfare, national strategy, and humanitarian missions worldwide – I’m covering these topics in the book.</p>
<p>All of the units I was assigned to were recognized with major organizational awards.  The people I have worked with earned top honors in military, leadership, academia and industry.  Even though we always found a way to win, I never took the credit as a personal accomplishment or destination– but I always took notes.</p>
<p>Now to you.  I don’t know you, but my need to serve you runs deep.  For you, I have finished a book that includes notes on tried-and-true leadership methods and some stories from my leadership endeavors.  I took my journey and notes and placed in a well organized and easy to consume layout.  This is not just some leadership book; it’s written to help you.</p>
<p><strong>What’s different than other “leadership” books.</strong></p>
<p>Many may think “another leadership book, why should I pick this one up?”  Besides the fact that it’s packed with quick wins you can apply to your life, this book is way different.  For one, this book is also the guide to a leadership certification.  Meaning, you not only get a book with great material and experiences, you also get something other books don’t give you.  Proof that you read it.  Proof that you can lead others.  Proof that you can show your employer or customers.  This may help you make more money; it will help you make a difference as a leader!  There are others, but you’ll have to read it to find out.</p>
<p><strong>Now – I need your help.</strong></p>
<p>Although several well-known and established publishers have offered to assist with this book, the words, stories, and delivery matter.  The only way to totally control the messages and ensure it comes to you direct from me is through self-publishing.  In order to do this the right way, it takes money.</p>
<p>From the options below, you can see that you have multiple ways to assist in getting this book of experience out into a world of leaders who are looking for it.  Your donations will fuel all the associated fees that go along with a professional and polished production that many need, and many will purchase.</p>
<p>As a gift for your help, I will ensure you get one of my first copies of the book.  I will sign it and send it to your doorstep.  If we know each other, you’ll get a message from me included in the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>No purchase – no problem. I still need your help.</strong></p>
<p>Send this link out to your social media friends.  Like and share my content.  I can’t get to everyone who will benefit from reading this book.  Please help by liking, subscribing, following and or commenting on my IG (Joshua_Aultman), YouTube (Leaders-KIT) and TikTok (Joshua_aultman_author).  This cost you nothing and you never know who will thank you for putting them onto the track for a future promotion/win or a birthday, graduation, and/or holiday gift.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book.</strong></p>
<p>The book is based on the common observation that leaders who focus on no more than three priorities, accomplish those priorities.  This is the rule of 3 and it is a direct correlation between how we have been trained to think, and how we are trained to act. </p>
<p>From childhood stories (Goldilocks and the 3-bears) to sporting events (Gold, Silver, Bronze), our formative years have trained us that three things are part of everyday life.  As adults in leadership positions, we sometimes try to focus on too many tasks and end up loosing focus on what is truly important.  This is where a leader could use the rule of 3.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have found that the rule of 3 consist of three main focus areas for leaders who have led highly productive units.  These areas are something that every leader must consider.  Once learned, this tool can be added to any leaders-kit.  True to the military environment that I was taught to lead in, I have developed an acronym and I call it M3.  Others have called it the platinum process for leadership, and I explain that in the book.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Respectfully, Joshua</p>
</div></div>","In some way, everyone is a leader.  My unique experience may just help you become a better one AND I need your help to make it a reality.
Using my lessons learned, I’ve cracked the code on how to get great results fast as a leader.  Having grown up in the technology boom, and, produced results by leading the most elite teams in the United State Military – there is something you’ll get out of this book that is not available anywhere else.  It'll be unique to you.  Why, it is a passion of mine to help others because the world becomes better when we have better leaders.  So, why listen to me?  Keep reading.
Meet…me.
My name is Joshua Aultman and for me, service is and has always been a family business. My great grandfather was a police Captain.  Grandfather and father, both served in elite military units.  My grandmother, mother, aunts, uncles and cousins contributed to service to other and supported other serving families from the home front.  Growing up, and still today, my family always recognized three things: family, continuous learning/improvement and service to our nation.  When I see others doing great things in these areas, I’m naturally drawn to them.  These people are my community and they become my extended family – if you are new to this world, welcome.
My personal military journey has made me an award-winning leader -- top 40 under 40 (in the world) for Armed Forces technology achievements.  I’m a person who has first-hand experience with multiple cultures, and I’m an avid writer - that's dangerous to the status-quo.  And let's be honest, just because it's worked in the past - doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.  This also means I have practice in making short, concise, and straight to the point messages.
I’ve been personally involved in major technology growth and process changes during a time of major evolutions in cyberspace, natural disasters, and worldwide pandemics.  These hard problems led to new methods of leadership applied to warfare, national strategy, and humanitarian missions worldwide – I’m covering these topics in the book.
All of the units I was assigned to were recognized with major organizational awards.  The people I have worked with earned top honors in military, leadership, academia and industry.  Even though we always found a way to win, I never took the credit as a personal accomplishment or destination– but I always took notes.
Now to you.  I don’t know you, but my need to serve you runs deep.  For you, I have finished a book that includes notes on tried-and-true leadership methods and some stories from my leadership endeavors.  I took my journey and notes and placed in a well organized and easy to consume layout.  This is not just some leadership book; it’s written to help you.
What’s different than other “leadership” books.
Many may think “another leadership book, why should I pick this one up?”  Besides the fact that it’s packed with quick wins you can apply to your life, this book is way different.  For one, this book is also the guide to a leadership certification.  Meaning, you not only get a book with great material and experiences, you also get something other books don’t give you.  Proof that you read it.  Proof that you can lead others.  Proof that you can show your employer or customers.  This may help you make more money; it will help you make a difference as a leader!  There are others, but you’ll have to read it to find out.
Now – I need your help.
Although several well-known and established publishers have offered to assist with this book, the words, stories, and delivery matter.  The only way to totally control the messages and ensure it comes to you direct from me is through self-publishing.  In order to do this the right way, it takes money.
From the options below, you can see that you have multiple ways to assist in getting this book of experience out into a world of leaders who are looking for it.  Your donations will fuel all the associated fees that go along with a professional and polished production that many need, and many will purchase.
As a gift for your help, I will ensure you get one of my first copies of the book.  I will sign it and send it to your doorstep.  If we know each other, you’ll get a message from me included in the book.
 
No purchase – no problem. I still need your help.
Send this link out to your social media friends.  Like and share my content.  I can’t get to everyone who will benefit from reading this book.  Please help by liking, subscribing, following and or commenting on my IG (Joshua_Aultman), YouTube (Leaders-KIT) and TikTok (Joshua_aultman_author).  This cost you nothing and you never know who will thank you for putting them onto the track for a future promotion/win or a birthday, graduation, and/or holiday gift.
 
The Book.
The book is based on the common observation that leaders who focus on no more than three priorities, accomplish those priorities.  This is the rule of 3 and it is a direct correlation between how we have been trained to think, and how we are trained to act. 
From childhood stories (Goldilocks and the 3-bears) to sporting events (Gold, Silver, Bronze), our formative years have trained us that three things are part of everyday life.  As adults in leadership positions, we sometimes try to focus on too many tasks and end up loosing focus on what is truly important.  This is where a leader could use the rule of 3.
Furthermore, I have found that the rule of 3 consist of three main focus areas for leaders who have led highly productive units.  These areas are something that every leader must consider.  Once learned, this tool can be added to any leaders-kit.  True to the military environment that I was taught to lead in, I have developed an acronym and I call it M3.  Others have called it the platinum process for leadership, and I explain that in the book.
 
The Layout.
A speed-readers dream.  For each of the three main M3 topics, I have taken my notes of what I have deemed important over the years and called them “Lessons Learned.”  These LL appear at the beginning of each note in a summary fashion.  Then a further explanation is provided for added context. 
For entertainment, I have added stories from each of my assignments that were enlightening moments that I shared with my teams and later formulated through more experiences.
The final part of the lesson is a “Best Practice.”  These are the things that I hope you may be able to make your own to develop success in your own endeavors.
The book is structured in a way that will allow you to consume the materials faster than any other book in its class.
 
Thank you!
Your donation is helping get this work out to those who need it.  The book will help future leaders, so thank you for helping all of us AND no matter where you lead - thank you for your leadership.

We also know the pain of having low battery in those important moments. The struggle is real, and these very issues that we had ourselves was how we created the SmartPad®. The ultimate solution to streamline all your essentials into one mini notebook, which also features our patented Qi charging pad on the cover and over 10+ features.

The strategies and tactics are designed to get you noticed and interviewed for the jobs you actually want - even when they are not advertised.Calendaring Tool - to help you schedule your interviews and phone calls; and keep track of all the things you need to do during your job search along with complete information on the company as well as your contact people at the company.  More specifically - here's exactly what the 7-Step System entails... 

CHOOSE: The Career Clarity Formula. Because you can’t hit a target you can’t see, you will get crystal clear on the job you seek and the 10-20 employers most likely to hire you. Includes how to research decision makers at up to 20 different employers in your industry, using a proprietary insight. 

CREATE: Attention Getting Resumes and Cover Letters. Your resumes and cover letters aren’t working. If they were, you’d be working now, right? We fix that, by creating a Guerrilla Resume and Cover Letter templates that are easy to customize and use over and over for the rest of your career.

BUILD: The Online Profile Builder. The easiest way to find a job is to have the job find you. So, we guide you on creating a LinkedIn profile that makes employers and recruiters want to meet you. You work using a  recruiter's inside knowledge  as your ""virtual"" coach, giving you a tremendous edge over other candidates.

LAUNCH: The Extreme Networking System. Raise your hand if you love networking. We thought so. The solution? Stop pestering friends and former co-workers with “elevator pitches” and other canned nonsense. Start having real conversations with hiring authorities who want to meet you. We show you how.

MEET: The Hidden Job Finder. This is where the rubber meets the road, typically within 30 days. After your network is humming with activity, we tell you how to ethically “force” hiring authorities to meet with you. This is where unadvertised jobs are often offered to you or created for you.

IMPROVE: The Interview Multiplier. Why settle for just one or two job interviews? It’s not uncommon for Guerrilla Job Hunters to average one interview for every two Guerrilla Resumes submitted. We help you build unstoppable momentum that leads to a rewarding new job.

LAND: The Job Offer Maximizer. When it comes to negotiating your highest salary, nothing beats multiple job offers. We help you maximize your chances and become the “MWC” (Most Wanted Candidate) employers pay top dollar for.
Fact: No other web site, career coach, guru, or “expert” can do what MyNewJobHunt can do for you.  This is the only job finding platform built for job hunters with the help of successful recruiters and marketers. Only MyNewJobHunt.com uses David Perry’s proprietary 7-Step “recruit-yourself” system that’s the basis for the best-selling book, “Guerrilla Marketing for Job Hunters 3.0.”It's easy to get started right away. Just select one of the perks on the right and get ready to interview and land job offers while we scale the platform.Investing with us today is an investment in your future’s tomorrow. After you choose your perk, forward this page to the 10 people you care about most…",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>First of all, let all of us here at LumID thank you for taking interest in our revolutionary idea! Our team came together in a business class at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Our team is comprised of five members from various backgrounds. We came together, thanks to our mentor Nick Greer, a successful entrepreneur and our teacher. We all have different strengths and feel that our talents and abilities will complement one another’s. A few of us have expertise in software development and technology, others have networking opportunities in education and advertising, and all of us have a common goal: create a product will change the world.</p>
<p>Our goal is to develop a projector that you can interact with through touch, at an affordable price. With your help, that will be just the beginning. We hope to develop these projectors with education in mind. We want to deliver a more interactive and fulfilling educational experience, capable of adapting to all kinds of learning and teaching styles. The possibilities are endless! Imagine being in a biology class as a student and having an interactive model of DNA on your desk that you can pull apart and put together. Imagine being able to see and interact with the processes of mitosis and meiosis. Imagine being a teacher for those students and having the ability to guide students through their own discoveries. Imagine being in an art class and being able to sketch out and design ideas a million times without ever wasting materials before putting them on canvas. There are countless applications inside and outside of education. This is our vision, and we hope you’ll join us in it!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Let’s break it down in more detail:</p>
<p>We are asking for $10,000 to move forward with our prototype and market our idea so that we can continue to find people who are interested in our vision</p>
<p>Every contribution helps no matter the size. You can feel free to donate as much or as little as you’d like.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal we won’t stop and we won’t let your donations go to waste! We’ll continue to work on our project as best we can for as long as we can, investing our own time and money until we succeed.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>As we said earlier, we hope that with time this product will truly revolutionize education—at first—and technology in general with time. We’re in this for the long haul, and we want to see this idea change the way we all interact with technology.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We understand that we are not the only ones with this technology or this idea. We know that, eventually, all of the big electronic companies will be competing with us. That’s why we need your help! The more funds we get and the faster we receive them, the better off we’ll be. We’re asking you to root for the underdog here! We know we’re a small business, but we know we can do it, we won’t be the first small businesses to revolutionize technology, i.e. apple and Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you aren’t able to make monetary contributions, we get it! We are college students after all. There are things you can still do! Please, if nothing else, make sure to share this on your Facebook wall, Instagram feed, Snapchat it to all your friends, and if you happen to know any millionaire entrepreneurs looking for new ventures, feel free to send them our way! </p>

Our goal is to develop a projector that you can interact with through touch, at an affordable price. With your help, that will be just the beginning. We hope to develop these projectors with education in mind. We want to deliver a more interactive and fulfilling educational experience, capable of adapting to all kinds of learning and teaching styles. The possibilities are endless! Imagine being in a biology class as a student and having an interactive model of DNA on your desk that you can pull apart and put together. Imagine being able to see and interact with the processes of mitosis and meiosis. Imagine being a teacher for those students and having the ability to guide students through their own discoveries. Imagine being in an art class and being able to sketch out and design ideas a million times without ever wasting materials before putting them on canvas. There are countless applications inside and outside of education. This is our vision, and we hope you’ll join us in it!
What We Need
Let’s break it down in more detail:
We are asking for $10,000 to move forward with our prototype and market our idea so that we can continue to find people who are interested in our vision
Every contribution helps no matter the size. You can feel free to donate as much or as little as you’d like.
If we don’t reach our goal we won’t stop and we won’t let your donations go to waste! We’ll continue to work on our project as best we can for as long as we can, investing our own time and money until we succeed.
The Impact
As we said earlier, we hope that with time this product will truly revolutionize education—at first—and technology in general with time. We’re in this for the long haul, and we want to see this idea change the way we all interact with technology.
Risks & Challenges
We understand that we are not the only ones with this technology or this idea. We know that, eventually, all of the big electronic companies will be competing with us. That’s why we need your help! The more funds we get and the faster we receive them, the better off we’ll be. We’re asking you to root for the underdog here! We know we’re a small business, but we know we can do it, we won’t be the first small businesses to revolutionize technology, i.e. apple and Microsoft.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you aren’t able to make monetary contributions, we get it! We are college students after all. There are things you can still do! Please, if nothing else, make sure to share this on your Facebook wall, Instagram feed, Snapchat it to all your friends, and if you happen to know any millionaire entrepreneurs looking for new ventures, feel free to send them our way!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We eventually developed a “sign language,” such as understanding twinkling eyes and wiggling toes meant she was happy.For me, this clarified the importance of “together-time” for two—not just when time is running out, but throughout our lives. So I created jathi (jaa-tee), short for “joined at the hip,” invites for two. It’s an iPhone app that helps you handpick the perfect activity and easily schedule time to spend one-on-one with people who matter most.We're trying to build something special here. Together, let’s create a cultural trend that shifts how we think about being face-to-face with one special person at a time.Let’s start with jathi!Together-time happens when we prioritize one-on-one time.We’re all busier than ever with work and chaotic lives.

The reason why the things you’ve made with so much effort get discarded so quickly is probably due to the product's low quality, lack of utility, or it simply becomes too much of a hassle to use.WOODSUM’s wooden assembly kits have continuous utility and also has value as an interior accessory. We created it to be a high-quality product by manufacturing each part with luxurious wood and by applying a UV coating on the surface. Unlike other wooden assembly kits, WOODSUM has a retro design with an analogue concept, making it great as an item to show off during usage as well as decor for your home. It will certainly be worthy to keep after assembly.WOODSUM’s pinhole camera is even more precious because it is assembled by you!   We've made fully functional wooden assembly kit.We launched WOODSUM with its DIY Wooden Kits back in 2015.  We've been making new products continuously with various designs. The retro Pinhole Camera, is the combination of all the best technology and designs we have to offer.  We have CE and ISO 9001We have the CE mark, which is a European certificate, andthe ISO9001 which is the international standard for quality management system established by the International Organization for Standardization.  We are in charge of manufacturing our products.Our products are made using a laser machine. We operate our own factory to produce this delicate and high-quality wooden kits without any defects.  We attended a lot of exhibitions in the world.We recently participated in world renowned exhibitions such as 2019 NY Toyfair and Maison&Objet Paris, where we have been recognized for Woodsum's value. Our history serves as a testament to Woodsum's brand value.",57.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>What is the zPower Trio?</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564177524/c6c5gdptaxvsflwp6k5y.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The zPower Trio is a desktop charger that can replace up to three of your current chargers. You have a charger for your USB-C laptop, a charger for your smartphone, and a charger for your tablet or e-reader. Now you only need one charger for all of them.</p>
<p>You may ask what makes this better than a power strip? Isn't a power strip the same thing but more powerful and versatile?</p>
<p>Here's why this charger is different. </p>
<h3>Travel-friendly</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564264866/ebk852jpyt2ubjtdjx8z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Slips easily into your backpack for travel use. Portability is key if you're someone who is always on-the-go, and if you hate opening your bag and seeing a bunch of messy chargers and cables, this is for you. </p>
<p>The zPower Trio is small, compact, and lightweight, so you can save space in your bag for other things. A lot of chargers on the market are unnecessarily large and heavy. We pack in as much utility as we can and make efficient use of every square inch of this charger.</p>
<p>If your hotel room or dorm doesn't have enough outlets or the nearest outlet is hard to reach,  the zPower Trio and its long 5ft AC lead cord will come in handy. </p>
<h3>Rugged, durable design</h3>
<p>Travel-friendly means more than just portability. Who knows what will happen while you're traveling? The last thing you want is a broken charger and dead batteries on all your devices. The zPower Trio is designed to withstand all the beatings of daily use, including drops and knocks. This charger will keep chugging along and give you peace of mind.</p>
<h3>Charge USB-C laptops</h3>
<p>USB-C makes charging simpler. If you have a USB-C laptop like the MacBook Pro or Dell XPS 13, just connect the laptop to the leftmost port of the zPower Trio via a C to C cable.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564177616/iwmy5lmsqohhusrjga9n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Three devices, three ports: 2 USB-C + 1 USB-A</h3>
<p>USB-C is the future of charging. That's the philosophy behind our previous project, <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zmi/the-powerpack-ambi-matte-black-dual-usb-c-battery-pack/?ref=kckstrtr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PowerPack Ambi</a>, and that's why the zPower Trio has two USB-C ports. In the future where USB-C is everywhere, you'll only need one cable type and one charger for all your devices. To smooth the transition to USB-C,  the single USB-A port will support legacy devices.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>65W USB-C output for your laptop</h3>
<p>65W is the sweet spot between a charger that doesn't have enough output to charge your workhorse laptop and a charger that is too heavy to carry. The zPower Trio is the perfect combo of power and portability.</p>

<h3>18W USB-C output for phones and tablets</h3>
<p>The middle port when used alone can output 18W to PD capable devices. You can use this port to fast charge your iPhone or Pixel phone. It can also charge USB-C tablets, including the iPad Pro 2018. </p>

<h3>18W USB-A output for fast charging</h3>
<p>The right port is a USB-A port that when used alone can deliver 18W to your Quick Charge compatible devices. For example, if you need to fast charge your Samsung Note9 or LG phone, this is the port you'll use. This port is also good for devices like e-readers that use USB-A to Micro-USB cables.</p>

<h3>Charge a laptop and fast charge a phone at the same time</h3>
<p>Need to recharge your laptop and phone at the same time? No problem, even when two ports are used, the port you use for your phone will still output 18W and the port for your laptop can output 45W. 45W is plenty of power for your laptop if you are browsing the web, checking email, or watching a YouTube video. You'll only need a higher wattage output if you plan on doing battery-intensive tasks like video editing or graphics-heavy gaming.</p>

Rugged, durable design
Travel-friendly means more than just portability. Who knows what will happen while you're traveling? The last thing you want is a broken charger and dead batteries on all your devices.

My name is Arkadiy Deliev and I am the CEO of DAPP Inc. Me and my business partners were always passionate about becoming world wide known entrepreneurs. We were even more passionate about making the world a healthier place!

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello! My name is Arkadiy Deliev and I am the CEO of DAPP Inc. Me and my business partners were always passionate about becoming world wide known entrepreneurs. We were even more passionate about making the world a healthier place! Last semester we had to make a presentation in Physical Education about hydration and its importance, but instead of using a regular Power Point we decided to use Android Studio for making an app, that not only describes what hydration is, but also provides useful tools any hydration seeker wants and needs.


Later, after that successful startup at our school, we decided to expand the app in its Alpha at that time to something even bigger! We decided to make it a tool for people who seek help to lose weight. We explained morbid obesity, as well as provided one very well structured food plan. If you back us up, we will construct even more plans, which can be customised especially for your weight and wanted weight in the end.


This campaign is very important to us! We are dreaming of changing the world, and you can be part of that same change! 


   What We Need & What You Get A minimum funding of $500 is needed for us to succeed! $150 of the money we earn will be used to publish the app on Android, iOS and Amazon. Half of the money left will be send to the ASMBS Foundation to help obese people battle their disease and for their further research. More about ASMBS Foundation - http://asmbsfoundation.org/about-the-asmbs-foundation/. The other half of the money that will be left after the publishing fees will be saved for later updates of the app and our university scholarships, we want our parents to be relieved from stress of paying those enormous tuition fees! But, of course, for donating curtain amounts of money on perks, you will get a lot of cool goodies!


We have got a wide range of perks! Any Amount Less Than $2 - We Thank You. $2 - We will follow you on Facebook, Twitter or Google +. $4 We will send you a personalised email to thank you (All of the above included). $8 - Become A Bronze Investor On Our Backgrounds On Facebook, Twitter and Google + (All of the above included). $16 - Become A Silver Investor On Our Backgrounds On Facebook, Twitter and Google + (All of the above except Bronze included). $32 - Become A Gold Investor On Our Backgrounds On Facebook, Twitter and Google + (All of the above except Bronze and Silver included). $64 - We will call you on Skype!

(All of the above except Bronze and Silver included). $256 - You will be included in the ""Special Thanks"" subsection (with a photo) under the ""About"" section on the app! (All of the above except Bronze and Silver included).


If we don't reach our goal, we will still try our best to publish the app and send all of the money left to the ASMBS Foundation. The only thing that will be cancelled are our scholarships, which is kind of sad...


   The Impact The app is targeted at Dubai, the city that we live in, but it will work flawlessly for anyone in the world!

A backlit mechanical keyboard with round key caps that evoke nostalgia of yesteryear complemented with durable Zinc alloy frame and a sumptuous genuine leather or wood surface.By combining genuine material and innovative technology in a classical typewriter-inspired form factor, we were able to achieve a new luxury in computing. We call it the Azio Retro Classic Keyboard.  AS FEATURED IN  GENUINE & LUXURIOUSWe wanted to incorporate natural materials that not only translates into higher quality build but also bring back the nostalgia of vintage goods that are personable to the physical touch and senses. This keyboard is not just about technical specifications but to provoke a certain tangibility that one can feel and connect with.Through countless prototyping with different materials, we decided to use genuine leather or wood for the top plate. Traditionally, these materials has always been associated with high-end customized goods and exclusiveness. It reflects taste, craftsmanship, and culture while emitting a unique charm that inspires.  FORGED. POLISHED. PLATED.The keyboard frame is forged with zinc aluminum alloy, then polished and plated into a beautiful black chrome (or satin copper finish) to accompany the leather/wood top plate.  Hex bolts are added for structural enhancements and to add an industrial vintage element to the keyboard.This alloy frame is corrosion free but through time and use, it will eventually start to bear weathering marks. This adds character to the product and is where we truly see the beauty of using genuine materials.  CLICKY. TACTILE. BACKLIT.Beneath every key is a backlit mechanical switch that not only delivers a satisfying tactile feel but also illuminates each key evenly and beautifully. AZIO TYPELIT MECHANICAL SWITCHWe specifically tuned the Retro Classic keyboard’s key switch to be tactile and modestly clicky, not too noisy yet reminiscent of the vintage typewriters.

However, since this is our first time creating a product of this scale, there may be some unforeseen hurdles that we may have to overcome. If issues do arise and impact the quality of the product or delay the shipment of rewards then we will do our best to overcome the problem and be completely transparent with our backers.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing Pero, a wearable controller that makes your smart devices even smarter. Pero turns your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device. Now, you can control the cursor and input commands with this single device so that you can focus more on getting the job done.   AAD function | Active Applicaiton DetectionPERO can perform Active Application Detection through the User Custom Program. You can send separate commands according to each application, even with the same gesture. 
Provide customized settings according to gesture usage patterns
Our “User Support Program” analyzes your natural gesture habits and patterns to learn your command preferences. Instead of fitting your needs to predefined shortcuts, make your own shortcuts that meet your exact needs!

 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 


 Pero also gives you full range cursor control. It does everything you want your mouse to do and more.


 

 
 


Pero lets you control the user-interface with just your gestures alone. 
Yes, just like Minority Report but better. Since this is real. Turn your simple hand motions into customizable shortcuts for your device.

 
 

 We manage applications by type. 
UCP can manage many applications easily by dividing types according to popular shortcuts and commands. And new applications can be updated faster. These advantages, combined with the AAD function, help effectively control the commands of the application through the Pero. 
 
 
Upcoming Supported applications 

 
 


 
 

   * Pero is not fully compatible with drone control at the moment. The video above is a demo test.       

 
 
 



 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

Pero also gives you full range cursor control. It does everything you want your mouse to do and more.

 
 
 

 


Palmcat’s Gesture Sensing Algorithm detects movement on the back of your hand while the touch panel strapped around the palm tracks the pressure from each of your fingers. Combining these two factors give you an almost unlimited choice of combinations! For example, even if you swipe your hand horizontally, it’ll carry different meanings depending on which fingers you place on the touch panel.

 
 

Comfortable Wrist
The positioning of the arm while using Pero prevents the build up of pressure and pain in the wrist. But Ordinary mice force the wrist into a bent shape  which causes discomfort and pain over time

 
When working with a mouse, you have to always work in the same pose and posture. However, you can work in a variety of poses and poses.
 

 
 

 PERO does not need space to control the cursor.
So Pero reduces the time you spend moving between the mouse and trackpad. It also helps you use your computer efficiently even in a desk-free working environment.

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

The movement of the hand is captured by the IMU sensor located on the back and the movement is detected through gestures through Palmcat's GR algorithm. The GR algorithm is a technique that can calculate each gesture in a lightweight chipset environment without the need for a separate analysis process or system by utilizing the advantages of the Palmcat hardware.        
The thumb button was designed to work like a mouse click. It’s placed right next to your thumb so all options to click, right-click, or drag are within finger reach.  Our fingers do a lot more than we give them credit for.  Think of the diverse purpose that each finger serves. The subtle differences in a tap, press, and pinch. The array of meanings they convey. We took the admiration of our nifty fingers to heart by utilizing their full potential in Pero. Its highly sensitive touch sensor recognizes each individual fingertip and when they’re being pressed down.
 

 
 
 

Simply connect it just like connect your wireless earbuds, easy and effortless! No external receiver needed. And PERO uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy). So you can use 37 hours on a 30-minute charge. 

 
 
 
 

 


Setting appropriate commands in advance according to the user's gesture usage pattern, 
Improve the accuracy by grasping the position of the finger touching the palm, 
It detects the application you are using and delivers the command.
It helps you set the commands you want in gestures.

UCP is our team's best gift to PERO buyers.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

You could be typing away, drinking coffee, or chatting with your coworkers.

our idea of selfie:

idea came from.

Oronote sticks to any firm surface. No more fumbling with paper sticky notes, searching for a pen or having notes drop to the floor. Simply write or record messages using the Oronote app.








When Oronote has something to say, it lets everyone know by lighting up and announcing that there is a message waiting. They can then tap or walk by to hear its message.

 





Oronote is packed with sensors. Motion, temperature, tap accelerometer, ambient light and time can all be used to deliver your message at the right moment.







Stick Oronote on any magnetic surface using its strong magnets. An included wall plate screws onto surfaces like brick or tile to let you dock and undock Oronote magnetically anywhere you want.











Oronote’s versatile, simple-to-use app works with both iOS and Android devices. Use it to store/manage dozens of messages with different trigger actions and control Oronote’s settings.








For typed messages, Oronote app’s smart text-to-speech engine supports multiple languages. Messages can also be left via the microphone in your own voice.







Oronote can replace stacks of sticky notes. Save paper, save the environment and save your refrigerator from becoming a multi-colored mess.










Oronote does more than just playing back notes and messages. It can announce the time and temperature after set intervals or when someone taps.









Oronote understands the value of beauty rest. You can set it to “do not disturb” mode using the Oronote app so that it will never activate during certain hours.








Change the color of Oronote’s “message waiting” glow to fit your fancy. You can also adjust other settings like message playback volume.








Oronote doubles as a motion-detecting night light that can be set to light up at certain times. It also can optionally announce the time and temperature when you wake up.

For replacement parts, or to lengthen the Ti Skini you can buy screws from us or any local/online hardware store, it's that simple. We include 3 different size screws, tools, washers, etc.. everything you'll need from 1 - 30 keys.  The Ti Skini can be sized to fit almost any set of keys by adding longer screws.  We offer in two different finishes.
Polish Finish - Raw Titanium polish to shine

Risks & Challenges
 
Production delays can happen, but we always route our A, B & C path before running any project. There's always the possibility a computer, machine, power, weather, etc.. can go down during production and that time can lead to delays. No fear we have backup plans for things like this and always keep our backers in tune as things happen !Please help and support the campaign! Feel free to drop us a line.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> Last Minute Hair is leading the charge as the first on-demand delivery service specifically for the beauty industry.</p>
<p>Last Minute Hair makes it easy for local beauty supply stores to market and sell their inventory directly to consumers through a mobile app and deliver from B2C in just one hour or less.  It allows users of the app to locate and purchase specific beauty-related goods from any beauty supply registered within a 40 miles radius. </p>
<p>On top of all the incredible functions of LMH, they operate as a fulfillment and distribution center for private-owned beauty product lines. This fulfillment center will also permit the sale of beauty-related goods products as late as 1 AM for people with busy work schedules. \</p>
<p>Last Minute Hair provides three membership options for both beauty supply stores and beauty consumers. The memberships are broken into two subcategories—licensed and non-licensed. </p>
<p>Last Minute Hair is making a pledge to sponsor a small beauty business with each goal made.</p>
<p>$500- Last Minute Hair will sponsor one local beauty supply store<br/>$1,000 - Last Minute Hair will sponsor 2 local beauty supply stores<br/>$2,500 - Last Minute Hair will sponsor 5 local beauty supply stores<br/>$10,000- Last Minute Hair will sponsor 8 local beauty supply stores and<br/>        five small beauty brands.<br/>$60,000- Last Minute Hair will sponsor 12 local beauty supply stores and                               <br/>        ten small beauty brands. </p>
<p>$100,000 - Last Minute Hair  will sponsor 50 local beauty supply stores and 50 small beauty        brands</p>
<p>OUR MISSION:</p>
<p>To help stimulate economic growth within communities by making it easier for consumers to shop and support their local businesses specifically in the beauty industry.</p>
<p>OUR PHILOSOPHY:</p>
<p>When you look good, you feel good, and the feeling good should be accessible to all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $100,000 to take this venture to market</p>
<p>To go more in-depth on what will be using that capital towards I will breakdown below:</p>
<p>To build out the app will we be using 50% of the raised capital. This will ensure user security and give drivers a portal to sign up to start working.</p>
<p>The remaining 30% will be used for payroll. I have recently hired new employees to assist with the onboarding of users and stores. And I plan on employing more people as we grow. </p>
<p>10% will go towards Operational costs such as maintaining and updating the software, processing inventory, sending out packaging materials to stores.</p>
<p>10% will go towards our marketing budget to help expand and scale the company.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Because we are partnering with local beauty businesses, the products purchased through the app will be supporting businesses within the neighborhood. Leading to, what I hope are, stronger small businesses, stronger neighborhoods, and stronger economic growth in the community. Especially underserved communities. I am creating jobs and have included in my business model, an internship program for college students looking for real-world experience in tech. As we grow, I hope to be able to include high school students as well. We would also help after the program to assist with job placement and continuing education courses. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Right now our biggest challenge is building out our POS software. We are in the process of developing the wireframe and will use the capital from this crowdfunding campaign to further develop its functionality and ensure security. We have multiple versions of the app prepared, and will release the first version as soon as possible, and then additional upgrades as we continue to raise capital. </p>

<p>Getting creative with 3D printers is amazing but it's not easy to print large, complex 3D models with typical 3D printers. Many of them cannot support the demands of high quality, large scale prints.  Prints such as these require special printers that are expensive, fragile and not easy to operate and maintain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So we created PrintHero, an industrial level 4K SLA 3D Printer for large-scale Prints. It includes special features such as extra-large print volume, 4K high resolution, and premium build quality that makes 3D printing efficient and easy for anyone!</p>

<p><br/>            The standard LCD screen can withstand a working temperature of 60 Celsius degrees. For the SLA 3D printer, it is designed with LCD-SLA principle and needs to place the LCD screen above the ultraviolet lamp. So if the temperature is too high, the LCD screen will be damaged and the printer will not work properly. </p>

</div></div>","Getting creative with 3D printers is amazing but it's not easy to print large, complex 3D models with typical 3D printers. Many of them cannot support the demands of high quality, large scale prints.  Prints such as these require special printers that are expensive, fragile and not easy to operate and maintain.
 
So we created PrintHero, an industrial level 4K SLA 3D Printer for large-scale Prints. It includes special features such as extra-large print volume, 4K high resolution, and premium build quality that makes 3D printing efficient and easy for anyone!
 
 

 

 
 
 

  Unrivalled Large Build Volume
PrintHero was designed to print extra-large projects that fit the size of big dreams. Supporting build volumes of up to 293*165*400mm, users can print whatever they desire in a groundbreaking large scale.
 

  Thanks to extra-large build volume, PrintHero is able to complete 34 pieces of standard dental model within 2hours at one-time, drastically boosting the printing efficiency. 
 

Fast Print Speed
The printing speed of PrintHero is up to 30mm/h. It enables handling of high-volume print jobs faster, drastically reducing necessary work hours.
 

 
Large Resin Volume
Packed with a 3kg resin volume, PrintHero can be printed continually, bring out the maximum of the creativity without adding resins many times.
 

 
 

  Precision and Accuracy
PrintHero is equipped with a 13.3” Industrial LCD Screen with 3840*2160 ultra-high resolution. Its 76μm XY and 10μm Z resolution lets you obtain ultra-fine print quality with more detail and dimensional accuracy.
 

 

  Uniform Exposure for 98% Surface Area
PrintHero delivers a uniform exposure for 98% of the surface area. With it, 3D models can be printed accurately within the whole printing area, which delivers a coincident precision to every dimension of 3D models.
 

 
 

 
Superior Build Quality
We used an all-metal design for PrintHero`s body not only to make it durable and stable during printing but also to make it a piece of art that will complement your workspace.
 

 
The hydraulic rod flip cover design allows you to operate it with one hand, saving time and effort.
 

 
 Dual linear rails and ball screws on Z-axis 
The unique dual-liner slides are designed to ensure the smooth and high-precision movement of the 3D printer.  It can avoid print misalignment and provides a lifting force of up to 100kg for easy printing and demolding.
 

 
Ultra-long Working Life
            The standard LCD screen can withstand a working temperature of 60 Celsius degrees. For the SLA 3D printer, it is designed with LCD-SLA principle and needs to place the LCD screen above the ultraviolet lamp. So if the temperature is too high, the LCD screen will be damaged and the printer will not work properly. 
 

 
 
PrintHero is designed with a super heat dissipation system and unique photothermal separation technology, which can keep the temperature of the LCD screen below 50 Celsius degrees even for a long time working, greatly extending the working life of the LCD screen.
 
 

 
 Easy to Use 

 
 Multifunctional Resins 
PrintHero comes with high quality liquid resins that are very affordable. We created 3 types of high-precision resins that satisfy the needs of any type of print project.
 

 
 
Compatible with 3rd Party Resin
PrintHero is also compatible with most available third party resins and you can use additional paints to achieve any color match you want.
 

 
 
Smart Touch Screen
With the deluxe 5'' touchscreen monitor on the body, users can change print settings & track printing status anytime with simple touch controls.
 

 
 
USB Drive & Wi-Fi Control
Other 3D printing systems are complicated and time-consuming. PrintHero is easy to use and you can get started printing in seconds with one-button prints and file transfer using LAN, USB drive or Wi-Fi connection.
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
Thanks our backers Roi and Douglas for providing us these prototypes, and we’ve printed.  link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:533652; https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2810666;

If you have some prototypes to print, welcome to share them in the comments and we’ll print for you.
 

 
 

 


 

 

 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
PrintHero has been producing high-quality 3D printers for years. Now we enter the second stage of our brand development, marked by this SLA 3D printer. We still adhere to the original intention of making good products, and constantly bring good products to this world we love.

<p>What about notes? Post-It
Notes (or sticky notes as it is also known) were invented nearly 40 years ago
and became the fifth best selling product of all time. They got bigger and
smaller and more colourful but they could not play music, show websites, play a
video, send text alerts or be interactive. They could hold a few words of text
or even a doodle but they could not provide a multimedia stream of two-way
communication – until today.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Medication Notifications &amp; Expiry Date Alerts</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>Medication alerts are
important notifications sent to individuals, reminding them to take
prescription medication at the times and in the amount prescribed by their
doctors. With the aging of the world's population, medications are being
prescribed at an ever increasing rate. Unfortunately, patients are not taking
these medications properly and this is creating an additional health hazard.</p>
<p>Tack-On labels can be
attached to medications and provide notification alerts via the smart phone.
Reminders can be set in the labels to remind patients to take their medications
at a prescribed date and time and in the proper dosage.</p>
<p>Besides medications
alerts, Tack-On label can also track the expiry date of medications and sent
notifications to the user when the expiry date is near.</p>
<p>Tack-On labels could help
reduce wastage in perishable food, cosmetic and health products with the expiry
date alert and notification. This is due to the cost-effective ability of the
Tack-On labels to reliably identify tagged items as well as gather informations on their conditions. With specific focus on expiry date and remaining
shelf-life, the consumers can manage the wastage with ease.</p>
<p><b>8)
Geo-tagging Digital Prints</b></p>
<p>Tack-On labels allow one
to share the location of the photos taken or where the video is captured.
Hence, photo albums, scrap books and presentation materials can have the

<p>The team has spend several
versions of the labels and modifying the features. We have re-spin on the
product designs at least 6 times before bringing it to the market. </p>
<p>After finding the right
design, we looked at several factories to identify suppliers to start
prototyping.</p>
<p>We have assembled the
prototypes and started the pilot run to prepare the product for manufacturing.
A lot of changes were made to the initial prototype design.</p>
<p>And now, we are ready to
bring the Tack-On label to you...The Journey is yet to be over.</p>
<p>We are asking for your
help here on Indiegogo! The funds we raise will be used to:</p>
<p>• Perform more stress
testing and refine our firmware</p>
<p>• Get the required
product certifications such as FCC and CE</p>
<p>• Design and
production of branded packaging</p>
<p>• Procure production
supplies in large quantities to minimize cost</p>
<p>• Produce, assemble
and ship the devices to you</p>
<p>• To help meet the
manufacturer minimum requirements in order to launch the initial line of
products.</p>

extensively researched and tested various technologies and materials for the
Tack-On Labels. The biggest challenge we face is being able to manufactured labels
that integrate both our design and technology to be affordable for the mass
market. The funds we raise during this campaign will ensure that we are able to
make a large enough order to our manufacturers to bring the price per unit down
far enough to allow us to guarantee that the finished product will be available
after the campaign at a price that remains affordable.</p>

The
Journey Behind Tack-On
We've gone through an
immense journey to get to the design that we are offering today. Below you can
see the different prototype steps we have gone through to finally bring you
Tack-On labels.
The team has spend several
versions of the labels and modifying the features. We have re-spin on the
product designs at least 6 times before bringing it to the market. 
After finding the right
design, we looked at several factories to identify suppliers to start
prototyping.
We have assembled the
prototypes and started the pilot run to prepare the product for manufacturing.
A lot of changes were made to the initial prototype design.
And now, we are ready to
bring the Tack-On label to you...The Journey is yet to be over.
We are asking for your
help here on Indiegogo! The funds we raise will be used to:
• Perform more stress
testing and refine our firmware
• Get the required
product certifications such as FCC and CE
• Design and
production of branded packaging
• Procure production
supplies in large quantities to minimize cost
• Produce, assemble
and ship the devices to you
• To help meet the
manufacturer minimum requirements in order to launch the initial line of
products.

Risks and challenges
We have already
extensively researched and tested various technologies and materials for the
Tack-On Labels. The biggest challenge we face is being able to manufactured labels
that integrate both our design and technology to be affordable for the mass
market. The funds we raise during this campaign will ensure that we are able to
make a large enough order to our manufacturers to bring the price per unit down
far enough to allow us to guarantee that the finished product will be available
after the campaign at a price that remains affordable.
