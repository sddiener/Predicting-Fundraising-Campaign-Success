<h3>About the Film &amp; Director</h3>
<p>My name is John Watt and I am a senior at John Brown University studying Digital Cinema. I grew up overseas as a missionary kid in Niger, West Africa and I came back to the U.S. to pursue a career in the field of movies.</p>
<p>Throughout my time at JBU, I helped on numerous senior films as an editor, director of photography, and even as an assistant director.  Some of the films have gone on to win awards at festivals. Now, it's my turn and I believe that I can stand up to the standards set by JBU films before me. </p>
<p>My film is called Ollie - the story of a boy who, believing he'll impress a girl, learns to do an ollie on his skateboard. A simple, funny short romance story that I believe will have a lot of heart and be my legacy left at JBU.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How YOU Can Help</h3>
<p>I am asking for $4,000 to go towards paying for the actors, food for everyone to eat, our props, costumes, and gas money to get people to and from set. The equipment is provided by the university.</p>
<p>To make donating a little more interesting, I've set up some incentives in exchange for the money towards developing Ollie. You can view these to the right. For each amount that you give, I will give something to you in return - as my way of saying thank you. And no matter how much you're able to give, it will be  greatly appreciate and you will receive a copy of my film via internet link.</p>
<h3>Thank You!</h3>
<p>No matter if the money is raised or not, I am excited to begin filming and to have this film show what I've learned these past 4 years at JBU. Thank you for your donations, prayers, and support.</p>

<h3>About ""Bottleneck""</h3>
<p>Jess is trapped. Approaching her mid-twenties, she still lives in her hometown on Vancouver Island with her college boyfriend Scott. The only good times in her life are party nights with her newly-single friend Kayla. But soon a pattern of self-destruction forces Jess to face her apathy towards life and the creeping discomfort that comes any time she is sober.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>Bottleneck is a short film that explores addiction in millennials - the way we abuse substances and use love as a crutch to cope with the crushing realities of life, and the excuses we make about what is a party and what is a problem.</p>
<p>This short film is serving as proof-of-concept for a feature film that will be used as a thesis for writer-director James Weicker's MFA.</p>

<li>Lights ($300)</li>
<li>Camera equipment ($350)</li>
<li>Sound editing ($1200)</li>
<li>Props and costumes ($600)</li>
<li>Travel expenses ($550)</li>
<li>Post-production (TBD)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total? We need about $3,000.</p>
<p>Our priorities are for the technical equipment to get this baby made - rentals for a monitor, follow focus, battery-powered lights, etc etc. Anything that you can contribute would first and foremost go towards that, followed by our sound editing and mixing, and then helping our crew recoup the costs of actually travelling and joining us on our film shoot.</p>
<p>Any money raised beyond $3,000 will then go towards submission fees to national and international film festivals.</p>

<h3>Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is <strong>Julius Vladimir Francisco</strong>, indie filmmaker, Ultra Runner, martial artist, and a long time patron of <strong>Bookfellows- Mystery and Imagination Bookshop</strong> (a.k.a. <i>Malcolm and Christine's Place</i>).</li>
<li>This documentary is about the history of <strong>Bookfellows - Mystery and Imagination Bookshop</strong> (the little shop that could), who were its various and eclectic patrons, and the impact it had on its patron's lives, the writing community, and as a favorite hangout of <strong>""The Group""</strong> (<i>Ray Bradbury's cadre</i>) and what ever happened to its legendary wall of signatures were some of the greatest writers of the 20th AND 21st century left their autographs.</li>
<li>These contributions would go a long way into allowing this project to be shown in a limited run in theaters or at the very least be shown for ""free"" in the streaming services where it can be seen by a much wider audience so that the memory of such a magical place will never die.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need and Why It Is Needed</h3>
<ul><li>The $18,000 will go a long way to not only an actual theater premiere and limited release but a campaign to distribute this film to a much wider audience (thru VOD/Streaming services and Blu-ray copies) that would otherwise not know of this legendary place or even have an idea how impactful it was to the history of creative fiction and Hollywood for the 20th and 21st centuries. This <strong>NOT</strong> a documentary about <strong>""The Group""</strong>(Ray Bradbury's cadre) other documentaries namely-  <br/><br/><a href=""https://www.jasunni.com/2017/05/17/charles-beaumont-the-short-life-of-twilight-zones-magic-man/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.jasunni.com/2017/05/17/charles-beau...</a><br/>have already done a splendid job exploring that.<br/><br/>*Although this can serve as a gateway for the members of Ray Bradbury's group to be known to the general public*.<br/><br/>The intent of this documentary is to show the history, meaning this place had to its patrons, and impact <strong>Bookfellows</strong> (<i>aka The Mystery and Imagination Bookshop, aka Malcolm's and Christine's place</i>) had on the community, the community of writers (science fiction, mystery, fantasy, and thriller mostly), and the city it was located in. It was the de facto home base/Hall of Justice/Avenger's tower of Ray Bradbury's cadre during the <i>Twilight</i> of their years.<br/><br/>Also the place is not only known for its history and promotion of writers of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Mystery but for their legendary <strong>""stairway wall to heaven of signatures"". The ""John Hancock"" of some of the most consequential  writers of the 20th and 21st century are their. What happened to it?</strong><br/><br/>The final part (3rd Act) of the documentary will be a section <strong>on the future of used bookstores (in America) as a institution after this pandemic</strong> has run its course.<br/><br/>The majority of the funds will be used for getting the film sold to the streaming services, the rest will be for  more interviews of patrons of the store as well as writers and other creatives who frequented it (safely and with PPE). On top of the ones we already have ""in the can""/archived. <br/> </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The main issue is the nature of how we will coordinate the interviews we need to complete the documentary.

</div></div>","Project

My name is Julius Vladimir Francisco, indie filmmaker, Ultra Runner, martial artist, and a long time patron of Bookfellows- Mystery and Imagination Bookshop (a.k.a. Malcolm and Christine's Place).
This documentary is about the history of Bookfellows - Mystery and Imagination Bookshop (the little shop that could), who were its various and eclectic patrons, and the impact it had on its patron's lives, the writing community, and as a favorite hangout of ""The Group"" (Ray Bradbury's cadre) and what ever happened to its legendary wall of signatures were some of the greatest writers of the 20th AND 21st century left their autographs.
These contributions would go a long way into allowing this project to be shown in a limited run in theaters or at the very least be shown for ""free"" in the streaming services where it can be seen by a much wider audience so that the memory of such a magical place will never die.


What We Need and Why It Is Needed
The $18,000 will go a long way to not only an actual theater premiere and limited release but a campaign to distribute this film to a much wider audience (thru VOD/Streaming services and Blu-ray copies) that would otherwise not know of this legendary place or even have an idea how impactful it was to the history of creative fiction and Hollywood for the 20th and 21st centuries. This NOT a documentary about ""The Group""(Ray Bradbury's cadre) other documentaries namely-  https://www.jasunni.com/2017/05/17/charles-beau...have already done a splendid job exploring that.*Although this can serve as a gateway for the members of Ray Bradbury's group to be known to the general public*.The intent of this documentary is to show the history, meaning this place had to its patrons, and impact Bookfellows (aka The Mystery and Imagination Bookshop, aka Malcolm's and Christine's place) had on the community, the community of writers (science fiction, mystery, fantasy, and thriller mostly), and the city it was located in. It was the de facto home base/Hall of Justice/Avenger's tower of Ray Bradbury's cadre during the Twilight of their years.Also the place is not only known for its history and promotion of writers of Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Mystery but for their legendary ""stairway wall to heaven of signatures"". The ""John Hancock"" of some of the most consequential  writers of the 20th and 21st century are their. What happened to it?The final part (3rd Act) of the documentary will be a section on the future of used bookstores (in America) as a institution after this pandemic has run its course.The majority of the funds will be used for getting the film sold to the streaming services, the rest will be for  more interviews of patrons of the store as well as writers and other creatives who frequented it (safely and with PPE). On top of the ones we already have ""in the can""/archived.  

Challenges
The main issue is the nature of how we will coordinate the interviews we need to complete the documentary. We already have archived video material of famous writers, several writers/former patrons willing and agreed to be interviewed for the project.We live in the era of Sars-Cov2/Covid 19.We own all our own equipment so renting audio and camera equipment are not really needed, however.....However, there are new safety concerns, especially considering the advanced years of some cultural and literary luminaries.We need PPE in addition to a travel budget for the interviewees and for us, the crew.The good thing is:

We have experience making films and have done this before.
It is much easier to get even more people willing to be interviewed (on top of what we already have in the can so to speak and scheduled) because of the nature of being stir crazy from the quarantine. Hence making this documentary possibly even go longer or be turned into a series to be sold to the streaming services.

<h3>PROJECT SUMMARY </h3>
<p>We  (Socialeyes) are collectively raising money to create and make a feature film in Dundee with the purpose of raising awareness and empathy around certain social issues in Scotland such as the  rate of drug deaths (1,187-2018) and suicides (784-2018). We will screen and distribute the film in disadvantaged communities and to charities working in the mental health sector. Our story lines are dramatised and made up from those with experience of the issues involved. We are also putting out a call to action for Dundee to get a community rehab to treat drug addicts.  <br/><br/>Away from striving to drive social change PTSD the movie will stand up as a piece of art in its own right with the perfect blend of social realism and dramatic action we have developed the proof of concept over the last 12 months we want to shoot the movie in 4k and distribute it through amazon with a percentage of the profits going back to run an art project in a disadvantaged community in Dundee providing film access and education where there is currently none. <br/><br/>To get a project like this funded through traditional means is very difficult its why we spent so long workshopping storylines going out on location in the schemes of Dundee setting the streets buzzing but we are taking on social issues that make certain sections of society uncomfortable and those certain sections control the funding pots for films and film access and education so this needs to be for the people by the people type of project. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>SOCIAL IMPACT</h3>
<p>We at social eyes believe that art has a therapeutic value that is currently unrecognised in the turbulent trauma that surrounds Dundee's unrelenting drug death crisis &amp; the horrendous amount of suicides these issues have respectfully been included in our story lines as a means not just to show the reality but to counter the bureaucratic nature the traditional media portray while often loosing the humanity in the statistical numbers. We want this film to be screened in the very same socially disadvantaged communities these issues affect and create pathways to have discussions about the issues raised. Our call to action in this film is to create a petition to submit to the government for a community rehab in Dundee we find it inexcusable that a city with the highest amount of drug deaths has no holistic rehabilitation service to treat addicts. </p>
<h3><strong>THE TEAM</strong></h3>
<p>The director Garry Fraser in the past has created short films that have directly affected drug policy in Scottish prisons and raised awareness of knife crime in the North of Edinburgh before going on to more high profile roles as the second unit director of T2: Trainspotting and the BBC's Grey Area away from his filmmaking projects Garry has run community development projects with the Violence reduction unit and is a keen enthusiast of using creativity as a way to steer going folk away from crime and drugs.  </p>
<p>Kirsty Miller is the manager and publicist of Social eyes a new start social enterprise in Dundee that aims to create debate and discussion around woman's rights and mental heath issues by creating music and films and online content.  </p>
<p>Our film crew will be made up of locals our casting will be done through using existing networks in socially deprived areas. We will also create a training space on the project for a trainee to come on and learn filmmaking skills providing access to education where there is currently none.        </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our budget for a feature film is already stretched with marketing and distribution included along with our production budget. We will be pushed for time we will approach various barriers in terms of accessing locations if we don't hit our target we may have to cut back on some equipment re write existing story lines but at the very least we will feed everybody and cover expenses.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you work for a charity or community group our screening &amp; discussion perk would be great for your organisation in terms of engagement.  Because we are also doing a call to action a signature on our petition for the holistic community rehabilitation centre . We would massively appreciate everybody sharing our hashtags #PTSDthemovie #Socialeyes along with sharing our content be great to have people sending us in there videos of support so we can share on social eyes channels every Friday as a way of saying thanks. </p>

<h3 style=""direction: rtl;text-align: center;"">Our Story </h3>
<p>The community of Mevo Modi’im came to be in the 1970s from a beautiful dream inspired by Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach and was founded on a mix of ideals based on love, prayer, and music. Like every group of people, there are hard truths that remain below the surface. When we do not confront those truths it separates us into our own worlds.  Similar to my community I only chose to see the beautiful things in life; little did I know.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of a fire in May 2019 my community was thrust together on a new uncertain path. The moments when no one had anything but the clothes on their backs and each other, reminded us as individuals of how dependent we are on our community.</p>
<p>Now united in a new goal to rebuild our home, we choose to confront those same truths that are now finally arising. It isn’t clear if it will be enough to hold us together as some might choose to leave, though one thing is for sure I will do my part.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Impact</h2>
<h3>How we all need community</h3>
<p>There are moments throughout our film that show the dark and hard parts of what it means to be part of a community. As the story unfolds we understand that only through acceptance of those ugly places in each other, only then can we really love and grow. </p>
<p>In a world where it is so easy to escape and build walls, the beautiful thing in a community is that you are forced to look out of your box and interact with your friends and family. <strong>These are the people that help us on our journey to meaning, they mirror who we really are and bring us closer to who we want to be</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Coping with disaster </h3>
<p>The film takes a look at a community as it moves through the initial stages of shock and grief when losing a home. The sad reality is, that forest fires and natural disasters aren't anything new, and many around the world have suffered complete devastation. Still, when losing those things that are irreplaceable, it is exactly the time when all that is precious to us becomes apparent. <strong>We hope others will be inspired by seeing how individuals and families manage to cope and support each other while rebuilding their new future.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The beauty of </span>spirituality </h3>
<p>Religion is often looked at as a colorless way to live surrounded by strict rules. Our film takes a good look at a religious community that doesn't really fit the bill of its kind. Through intimate observation of people facing the unknown, <strong>the film slowly shows the unique qualities of what it means to connect to something deeper than one's self</strong>.</p>
<p>It is in our spiritual moments, as we gather in celebration singing and dancing, we play our instruments to match ourselves to our neighbor's song. It is a moment of profound ecstasy that one can not reach alone. It becomes clear that there is a beautiful connection between community and religion.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Creators </h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Producer &amp; Co-Director</strong></p>
<p>My name is Yehuda  Golomb, born and raised in a small community of less than a hundred families called Mevo Modi'im. I have always been fascinated by sci-fi and fantasy stories that help me see the beauty in the world around me. Naturally from there, it was a skip and a hop to diving into filmmaking. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of the fire, which destroyed my home and those of many of my friends and neighbors, I began to document the process of rebuilding and our journey back to familiar grounds. </p>
<p>Coming from a place of imagination, I found myself struggling with the creation of something so real and exposing. These challenges I confronted, brought me to a breaking point where I almost gave up and stopped filming. It has hit me that the clash between fantasy and reality will always accompany me, and surprisingly I have found it to be my main source of inspiration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Director</strong></p>
<p>My name is Ido Fruchter, a young filmmaker from Israel. I am drawn to powerful yet small stories that pass us by on our day to day. If we only took a moment to really listen, we would see the beauty in all that is around us. </p>
<p>Sad to say, in most of my previous projects I got used to working alone. Something about it was probably easier. But ""easy"" is not necessarily good. Now, after a fascinating journey I am just beginning to understand the importance of true teamwork in creating something meaningful and for all aspects of life.</p>

When we started filming in May 2019 we never imagined the complexity and depth of this project, that it would be years of work and still more to go. As our story started unfolding the need for a crew expanded with it. At this point, the necessity for initial funding is our top priority, and this is where we need your help.</span><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;""> The success and impact of our film are now up to you.</strong>

<p dir=""RTL"" style=""text-align: center;"">בעקבות שריפה הרסנית במאי 2019, הקהילה שלי ''הושלכה'' יחד לדרך חדשה ולא ברורה. הרגעים בהם לאף אחד לא ההיה שום דבר מלבד הבגדים על גופם, ואחד את השניה, הזכירו לנו כיחידים כמה אנו תלויים בקהילה שמסביבנו.</p>
<p dir=""RTL"" style=""text-align: center;"">כעת, מאוחדים במטרה חדשה לבנות מחדש את ביתנו, אנו בוחרים להתמודד עם אותן אמיתות שעולות סוף כל סוף לפני השטח. לא ברור אם זה יהיה מספיק כדי להחזיק אותנו יחד מכיוון שחלקנו עשויים לבחור לעזוב, אמנם דבר אחד בטוח – אני אעשה את החלק שלי.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story 
The community of Mevo Modi’im came to be in the 1970s from a beautiful dream inspired by Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach and was founded on a mix of ideals based on love, prayer, and music. Like every group of people, there are hard truths that remain below the surface. When we do not confront those truths it separates us into our own worlds.  Similar to my community I only chose to see the beautiful things in life; little did I know.
In the aftermath of a fire in May 2019 my community was thrust together on a new uncertain path. The moments when no one had anything but the clothes on their backs and each other, reminded us as individuals of how dependent we are on our community.
Now united in a new goal to rebuild our home, we choose to confront those same truths that are now finally arising. It isn’t clear if it will be enough to hold us together as some might choose to leave, though one thing is for sure I will do my part.
 
        עברית למטה        

 
Impact
How we all need community
There are moments throughout our film that show the dark and hard parts of what it means to be part of a community. As the story unfolds we understand that only through acceptance of those ugly places in each other, only then can we really love and grow. 
In a world where it is so easy to escape and build walls, the beautiful thing in a community is that you are forced to look out of your box and interact with your friends and family. These are the people that help us on our journey to meaning, they mirror who we really are and bring us closer to who we want to be.
 
Coping with disaster 
The film takes a look at a community as it moves through the initial stages of shock and grief when losing a home. The sad reality is, that forest fires and natural disasters aren't anything new, and many around the world have suffered complete devastation. Still, when losing those things that are irreplaceable, it is exactly the time when all that is precious to us becomes apparent. We hope others will be inspired by seeing how individuals and families manage to cope and support each other while rebuilding their new future.
 

The beauty of spirituality 
Religion is often looked at as a colorless way to live surrounded by strict rules. Our film takes a good look at a religious community that doesn't really fit the bill of its kind. Through intimate observation of people facing the unknown, the film slowly shows the unique qualities of what it means to connect to something deeper than one's self.
It is in our spiritual moments, as we gather in celebration singing and dancing, we play our instruments to match ourselves to our neighbor's song. It is a moment of profound ecstasy that one can not reach alone. It becomes clear that there is a beautiful connection between community and religion.

The Creators 
 
Producer & Co-Director
My name is Yehuda  Golomb, born and raised in a small community of less than a hundred families called Mevo Modi'im. I have always been fascinated by sci-fi and fantasy stories that help me see the beauty in the world around me. Naturally from there, it was a skip and a hop to diving into filmmaking. 
In the aftermath of the fire, which destroyed my home and those of many of my friends and neighbors, I began to document the process of rebuilding and our journey back to familiar grounds. 
Coming from a place of imagination, I found myself struggling with the creation of something so real and exposing. These challenges I confronted, brought me to a breaking point where I almost gave up and stopped filming. It has hit me that the clash between fantasy and reality will always accompany me, and surprisingly I have found it to be my main source of inspiration.
 
Director
My name is Ido Fruchter, a young filmmaker from Israel. I am drawn to powerful yet small stories that pass us by on our day to day. If we only took a moment to really listen, we would see the beauty in all that is around us. 
Sad to say, in most of my previous projects I got used to working alone. Something about it was probably easier. But ""easy"" is not necessarily good. Now, after a fascinating journey I am just beginning to understand the importance of true teamwork in creating something meaningful and for all aspects of life.

We can't do it alone 

This is our first undertaking of a feature-length film. When we started filming in May 2019 we never imagined the complexity and depth of this project, that it would be years of work and still more to go. As our story started unfolding the need for a crew expanded with it. At this point, the necessity for initial funding is our top priority, and this is where we need your help. The success and impact of our film are now up to you.

 
Our perk's 
A big part of a community is being there for each other. Growing up I loved the fact that I was always surrounded by all sorts of artists. Now I have the opportunity to share with you all what I love.
Some of the creations that come out of our community:

Painting of Yitzchak Ben Yehuda.
Ceramics by Leah Siver. 
Natural Cosmetics of Chanita Golomb.
Weavings by Nikki Naftaly. 
Silverwork by Sara Naftaly.

 
We truly appreciate every contribution. Please share with your friends and family!!!
 
 
הסיפור
קהילת מבוא מודיעים נולדה בשנות השבעים מתוך חלום יפיפה בהשראת הרב שלמה קרליבך, והוקמה על בסיס שילוב האידיאלים של אהבה, תפילה ומוסיקה. כמו בכל קבוצה של אנשים, ישנן אמיתות קשות שנותרות מתחת לפני השטח. כשאנחנו לא מתעמתים עם אמיתות אלה זה מפריד אותנו אך מהשני, כל אחד לעולמו. בדומה לקהילה שלי, גם אני בחרתי רק לראות את הדברים היפים בחיים; כמה שלא היה לי מושג...
בעקבות שריפה הרסנית במאי 2019, הקהילה שלי ''הושלכה'' יחד לדרך חדשה ולא ברורה. הרגעים בהם לאף אחד לא ההיה שום דבר מלבד הבגדים על גופם, ואחד את השניה, הזכירו לנו כיחידים כמה אנו תלויים בקהילה שמסביבנו.
כעת, מאוחדים במטרה חדשה לבנות מחדש את ביתנו, אנו בוחרים להתמודד עם אותן אמיתות שעולות סוף כל סוף לפני השטח. לא ברור אם זה יהיה מספיק כדי להחזיק אותנו יחד מכיוון שחלקנו עשויים לבחור לעזוב, אמנם דבר אחד בטוח – אני אעשה את החלק שלי.
למה?
כולנו זקוקים לקהילה.
ישנם רגעים רבים לאורך הסרט שמראים את החלקים האפלים והקשים בתוך הקהילה. עם התפתחות הסיפור אנו מבינים שרק באמצעות קבלת אותם מקומות ''מכוערים'' זה בזה, רק אז אנו יכולים באמת לאהוב ולצמוח.
בעולם שבו כלכך קל לברוח ולבנות קירות, הדבר היפיה בקהילה הוא שאתה נאלץ להסתכל מחוץ לקופסה שלך ולקיים אינטרקציה עם חברים ומשפחה. אלה האנשים שעוזרים לנו במסע למשמעות, הם משקפים את מי שאנחנו באמת ומקרבים אותנו למי שאנחנו רוצים להיות.
היופי שברוח
לעיתים קרובות ''דת'' נראית כדבר חסר צבע, מוקפת בכללים נוקשים. הסרט שלנו מתבונן היטב בקהילה דתית שלא ממש מתאימה לתיאור הפשטני הזה. באמצעות התבוננות אינטימית באנשים העומדים בפני הלא נודע, הסרט מראה לאיטו את התכונות הייחודיות שחבויות בהתחברות למשהו עמוק יותר מעצמנו.
חיים בצל האסון
הסרט מתבונן בקהילה מרגע ההלם הראשוני והאבל באבדן הבית. המציאות העצובה היא ששריפות יער ואסונות טבע אינן דבר חדש ורבים ברחבי העולם סבלו מהרס מוחלט. ובכל זאת, כאשר מאבדים את הדברים שאין להם תחליף, זה בדיוק הזמן בו כל מה שיקר לנו מתגלה. אנו מקווים שאחרים יקבלו השראה מצפייה באנשים והמשפחות אשר מצליחים להתמודד ולתמוך זה בזה תוך בנייה מחודשת של עתידם החדש.

<h3>CHILD WARFARE - Tax Deductible Short Film </h3>
<p>Hello and Welcome to the official IndieGogo page for the short film <u><strong>Child Warfare</strong></u>. We have completed 2 out of 3 days of filming and we need your tax deductible help to raise the funds to finish the film! </p>
<p><u><strong>Theodore Roosevelt once said ""Speak softly, but carry a big stick... You will go far."" The question we need to ask ourselves is ""When did we forget to speak softly?""</strong></u></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary of the Film</h3>
<p>Child Warfare is a 5-7 minute short film that focuses on the story of a fictional President who is under pressure to invade a country and start a new war. This war is not because the US is under attack, but rather yet another regime-change war with no exit strategy. The Top Generals are urging the President to invade, but he has many concerns. With pressure pounding down on him he makes the rash decision to start the attacks that will lead to this new war. He steps into the hall of the White House from the war room and finds his children playing “WAR.” He is transported to a battlefield where he sees not full-grown adults, but rather children fighting this war he rashly entered. Children as young as four dressed in full military uniform fighting and laying down their lives. They are calling for their mothers as they hold their guts in and watching their lives flash before their eyes as they choke on their own blood. The movie is a metaphor that teaches us each soldier fighting in this war is not just a number, but rather somebody’s child. The decision to potentially send someone’s child to their death should not be made in haste, but with the greatest consideration for each life that may be lost. It is when the President sees his own child gunned down in front of him that he comes back to reality. Child Warfare uses graphic imagery to drive home it’s message, and it pulls no punches.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are a group of diverse filmmakers based out of Pittsburgh, PA who have come together to make a very powerful film. By teaming up with the non-profit ""Steeltown Entertainment,"" we were able to receive a very competitive and coveted grant from The Heinz Endowment's Small Art's Initiative. We beat out hundreds of other projects, and received the full amount that we applied for. This was before COVID-19 though, and the budget changed drastically due to extra safety precautions we had to take for saftey.  By receiving this grant we were able to shoot the two hardest days of filming, but we require a third day of filming to shoot the beginning and end of the movie. This is why we are coming to you! Not only can you find out all about our project on our official website <a href=""http://www.childwarfare.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.childwarfare.com</a>, but you also can sign up for updates to stay in the loop with how the production is progressing! By helping us finish this film we can help put an end to the endless wars, and save millions of lives.</p>
<p>Our team is lead by the Writer and Director <u><strong>Joseph G. Bucci</strong> </u><i>(Joe)</i> and the film is staring <u><strong>Cotter Smith</strong></u> from such hit TV shows like Netflix's ""Mindhunter"" and FOX's ""X-2: X-Men United"" where he plays the President! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need to Finish this film!</h3>
<p>We are so close to finishing this film you can almost taste it! We have already shot the most difficult parts of this film, so now comes the easy part. No more overnights with kids and special effects during a pandemic! Now we have a total of three scenes to shoot in one location, but we need money to pay for things like Location Fee's <i><strong>($2,000)</strong></i>, Catering <strong><i>($1,000)</i></strong>, Crew Salaries <strong><i>($5,000)</i></strong>, Equipment Rental <b><i>($2,000)</i></b>, and every other unseen expense that goes into making a movie. We also need funds for post production. Things like Audio Mixing, Visual Effects, and Editing cost more money than you would think, and these steps in the filmmaking process are some of the most crucial!  We are looking to raise a total of $8,000 to finish this film. While we do have some funds left over from the grant that is not nearly enough to make sure the lights stay on and that we are not paying people a year after they have finished working. We have budgeted accordingly, and we are not looking to make a dime for ourselves off this film. The funds raised here will solely be used to  make sure our crew is paid a fair wage for their work on the film, and that all of our expenses are covered to make sure the first and last scenes look as good as the middle chunk of this movie.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>So what happens if we surpass our goal?</u></p>
<p>Well then we can use that extra money for things like crew gifts for all of their hard work. We can hire more name talent to be in the film, and we can do things like bring some of our backers out to the first public screening! It really all depends on how much money we are able to raise!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>And if we don't make our goal?</u></p>
<p>We plan on taking the funds we are able to raise and making the best movie we can with them. We are also raising funds privately through working multiple jobs, tax returns, and maybe even selling our AD Adam's Kidney.... Needless to say this film will get done. The amount of money we are able to raise via our crowdfunding campaign will determine how many corners we have to cut. If we hit our goal, we wont have to cut many! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To give you a little background on why this film is so important, I will give you some numbers to put it into perspective of how damaging these wars that we have entered have been. Regime change wars are nothing new to the US foreign policy, but one thing has remained consistent. That consistency is the amount of damage they leave in the wake to the world and it's people. We will only start with the wars starting in 2003. These numbers are provided by Brown University's ""Cost of War Project,"" and are accurate up to 2018.</p>
<ul>
<li>6,951 US Military deaths</li>
<li>Over 40,000 US military Wounded in action</li>
<li>Over 110,000 Afgan and Iraqi Military and Police Officers Killed </li>
<li>Over 266,000 Civilian Deaths</li>
<li>United States Kids born after the start of the wars on 9/11 are now fighting in these wars</li>
<li>The wars have cost the US tax Payers $6.4 Trillion ($6,400,000,000,000.00)</li>
</ul>
<p>With the blood of over 507,236 human beings on our hands we need to take into consideration of what the damage of these wars are actually doing. Without getting into the politics of why we invaded Iraq we can look at the numbers and the devastation it has caused. </p>
<p>The thing about this is that these are just numbers to the average American. American's are use the the wars being fought in a far off land and is something that is ""Just happening and I can't do anything about it."" On 9/11 we got a taste of what it is like to have someone attack you and the ones you love. We have forgotten what it's like to be in fear of bombs and gun fire. A lot of people have become numb to the wars, and couldn't point out on a map where they are being fought if asked. If this film can bring that reality back to Americans and people around the world then we can then begin to talk about ending these endless wars. If the film saves one life out of all of our troops then it was worth every penny and second put into this film.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have faced a lot of challenges making this movie already. Besides battling a pandemic during our outdoor shoot at night with child actors we had to brave thunderstorms, freezing cold,  live pyrotechnics, and all practical effects. This film was and still is a logistical nightmare when it comes to making movies. We have overcome every challenge that we could for this film, and we keep rolling with the punches. Our most daunting task right now is raising the remaining funds to finish the film. Once the funds are secured more challenges will arise, but we will be ready for them! With your help we are able to overcome anything that will be thrown our way. We have an amazing team that is passionate and dedicated to this film. We have some of the most talented people in the Pittsburgh area working with us, and we will go far! </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to help us monetarily share our page with 10 people on your friends group and ask them to do the same. The average number of facebook friends a person has is 338. If we are able to make this go viral then we will be able to hit our goal! Anything helps us at this point. </p>

The funds raised here will solely be used to  make sure our crew is paid a fair wage for their work on the film, and that all of our expenses are covered to make sure the first and last scenes look as good as the middle chunk of this movie.  
 
So what happens if we surpass our goal?
Well then we can use that extra money for things like crew gifts for all of their hard work. We can hire more name talent to be in the film, and we can do things like bring some of our backers out to the first public screening! It really all depends on how much money we are able to raise!
 
And if we don't make our goal?
We plan on taking the funds we are able to raise and making the best movie we can with them. We are also raising funds privately through working multiple jobs, tax returns, and maybe even selling our AD Adam's Kidney.... Needless to say this film will get done. The amount of money we are able to raise via our crowdfunding campaign will determine how many corners we have to cut. If we hit our goal, we wont have to cut many! 
 

The Impact
To give you a little background on why this film is so important, I will give you some numbers to put it into perspective of how damaging these wars that we have entered have been. Regime change wars are nothing new to the US foreign policy, but one thing has remained consistent. That consistency is the amount of damage they leave in the wake to the world and it's people. We will only start with the wars starting in 2003. These numbers are provided by Brown University's ""Cost of War Project,"" and are accurate up to 2018.

6,951 US Military deaths
Over 40,000 US military Wounded in action
Over 110,000 Afgan and Iraqi Military and Police Officers Killed 
Over 266,000 Civilian Deaths
United States Kids born after the start of the wars on 9/11 are now fighting in these wars
The wars have cost the US tax Payers $6.4 Trillion ($6,400,000,000,000.00)

With the blood of over 507,236 human beings on our hands we need to take into consideration of what the damage of these wars are actually doing. Without getting into the politics of why we invaded Iraq we can look at the numbers and the devastation it has caused. 
The thing about this is that these are just numbers to the average American. American's are use the the wars being fought in a far off land and is something that is ""Just happening and I can't do anything about it."" On 9/11 we got a taste of what it is like to have someone attack you and the ones you love. We have forgotten what it's like to be in fear of bombs and gun fire. A lot of people have become numb to the wars, and couldn't point out on a map where they are being fought if asked. If this film can bring that reality back to Americans and people around the world then we can then begin to talk about ending these endless wars. If the film saves one life out of all of our troops then it was worth every penny and second put into this film.
 

Risks & Challenges
We have faced a lot of challenges making this movie already. Besides battling a pandemic during our outdoor shoot at night with child actors we had to brave thunderstorms, freezing cold,  live pyrotechnics, and all practical effects. This film was and still is a logistical nightmare when it comes to making movies. We have overcome every challenge that we could for this film, and we keep rolling with the punches. Our most daunting task right now is raising the remaining funds to finish the film. Once the funds are secured more challenges will arise, but we will be ready for them! With your help we are able to overcome anything that will be thrown our way. We have an amazing team that is passionate and dedicated to this film. We have some of the most talented people in the Pittsburgh area working with us, and we will go far! 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you are not able to help us monetarily share our page with 10 people on your friends group and ask them to do the same. The average number of facebook friends a person has is 338. If we are able to make this go viral then we will be able to hit our goal! Anything helps us at this point.

<h3>The Story.</h3>
<p>How many of us have disregarded red flags about a potential love interest and went out on the date anyway? Vanessa, a single African American woman, tortured by societal pressures and a long stint of loneliness, throws caution to the wind to meet her prince charming for the first time. Vanessa is head over heels, but this nagging feeling won't go away. <i>He does call and text a lot, but how is he too busy to video chat? How does he know things about me, like details of what I'm wearing that day or what I watch on TV? Maybe he's really intuitive. Maybe I am overreacting. This feeling in my gut isn't my intuition telling me not to go. It's my trauma of past relationships coming back to haunt me. It will be fine. I mean, what is the worst that could happen?</i>  <br/> </p>
<p>I got this idea of this short film after a very uncomfortable blind date a few years ago. We met online, and when he walked into the restaurant, I knew something was off. This is not the person he presented himself to be. I politely sat through the dinner of him staring intensely at me, telling me how beautiful I was and smiling like a psycho. After the most painful hour, I made an excuse to leave. He walked me to my car, and the entire time I was on high alert. After getting in my car and locking the doors, I drove off with a sense of relief. When I got home, I immediately went over every detail of the date, and I started wondering if this could have ended badly for me, and I began to write Swipe Left. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Campaign </h3>
</div><div>
<p>I designed Sommer Camp Productions to produce horror and seek out Black and brown folks, women, and LGBTQ folks, who are trying to break into film and television production within the Oregon film community. Film sets don't often represent us well, and many times, not at all. Sommer Camp is changing that. Your contributions will directly help us contract a broad range of folks in front of and behind the scenes.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need to raise $10,000 to complete the Swipe Left film. The funding will go towards pre-production planning, casting services, VR camera equipment rental (day), app design (VR), non-linear editing, lighting, day of insurance, an hourly COVID officer, two location rentals, permit to film Downtown Portland, transportation for the crew to locations, meal stipend, actors, post-production music mixing, marketing (film festivals, events), etc. Any monies raised above the targeted goal will go back into the SCP film account to go towards the next film project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Swipe Left is valuable because of representation in horror, exploring new interactive storytelling spaces (VR). In addition to addressing themes of loneliness, societal pressures on women at a certain age to be married and have children, ignoring red flags, internet dating, and not trusting your instincts.</p>
<p>This piece is not just for horror entertainment. Shooting this virtual reality project allows the viewer to see both sides' perspectives and how easy it is for Black and Brown women to go missing in the United States, and it's rarely talked about. If anything, I hope that this project will start the conversation surrounding how two very different people process loneliness.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Liam Santa Cruz, a writer, director, and actor in my final semester of film school fundraising for my thesis film. We seek to raise a minimum of 9,000 to cover the cost of principal photography, crowdfunding fees, and reward perks for <strong>LOCALS ONLY</strong>, a short film/proof of concept horror-comedy that we will be shooting outside Santa Cruz, California, this April. The film should be completed by late June for all of you to enjoy. Please scroll below for our rad perks and to find out the hype around LOCALS ONLY.</p>

<p><strong>Locals Only is a fresh horror-comedy that throws a group of surfers into the sketchy waters of the slasher genre.  It's a timeless genre, told through the lens of 21st-century west-coast beach rats. </strong></p>

<p>Not to be tacky or anything but cinema changes lives. Especially right now. I’ll elaborate, don’t worry. With the world being the way it is right now, we take a lot of pride in being able to create something that people can look forward to. Locals Only is as much of a classically themed film as it is one with new laughs, new talent, and new summer nostalgia. As filmmakers, it’s our duty to make some light out of this insane situation we are in. We just need a little extra help getting there. (That’s where you guys come in.)</p>
<p>Our team is really good at making films on a budget (and making them look really good). We have taken some ambitious risks in the past. (i.e., Traveling to the ghost towns of Southern California, as well as packing up our entire crew to shoot a feature in small-town Virginia.) Our crew is great at adapting to whatever is thrown their way.</p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Hello, I'm Liam Santa Cruz, a writer, director, and actor in my final semester of film school fundraising for my thesis film. We seek to raise a minimum of 9,000 to cover the cost of principal photography, crowdfunding fees, and reward perks for LOCALS ONLY, a short film/proof of concept horror-comedy that we will be shooting outside Santa Cruz, California, this April. The film should be completed by late June for all of you to enjoy. Please scroll below for our rad perks and to find out the hype around LOCALS ONLY.
    
Locals Only is a fresh horror-comedy that throws a group of surfers into the sketchy waters of the slasher genre.  It's a timeless genre, told through the lens of 21st-century west-coast beach rats. 
   

Jane (Gabrielle Elyse) and Sam (Madhulika Krishan) drive up to the infamous RED WATER COVE, which supposedly is home to the best waves in Northern California.  When they arrive at the cove they find it is not only home to the best waves but a half-dead surfer known as THE RIPPER who hunts down surfers who shred in his waters.

AND OF COURSE ...
                         
      
 
                                       
 
DIRECTOR: LIAM SANTA CRUZ
(GAME OF WITS, THE END)
                                     
DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY: BRYCE SOURIALL
(LIFE'S A DRAG, UNDER THE FLICKERING LIGHTS)

 
PRODUCERS: GRACE PETRO, SYDNEY DAY, and HALLIE GARDNER
(FOR HER, GROW UP, SLEEP WITH SADIE )

 
COMPOSER: WORN-TIN 
(LA-based artist with over 200,000 monthly listeners)
 
    

 
9,000 seems like a lot. Trust me, we know. So, we made a rad little Pie Chart to further explain our needs. You know that scene in The Big Short when Margot Robbie explains finance terms? It’s like that. But without Margot Robbie. 
Every cent counts and we can promise to make good use of it. Making a movie is tough, but making a movie in the Pandy (Covid-19 Pandemic) is extra tough, but nothing is stopping us from telling the story we want. We just need your help. Below is a breakdown of where all the money we raise will be allocated to help us safely shoot on location in Northern California. 

 
   
Perks are hard to come up with because there is truly nothing we could give that would be equal to what you’re doing for us. That being said, our perks are extra perky.
A LOT of crowdfunding campaigns are afraid attaching physical perks because its extra work but for this project we will do anything to make this movie happen! The 5ver - Get a custom social media shoutout - 5 Dollars


The Dub - A rad Locals Only sticker that you can slap on your hydro bro and a social media shoutout. CMON, all for 20. That's a KILLER deal. - 20 Dollars


Signed Script - For all you readers out there get a signed script from the cast & crew! - 30 Dollars


The Mixtape - Jam out to a rad cassette tape of Worn-Tin's original score of the film with some secret summer tunes handpicked by him that are mixed in. Digital Download of the score as well! - 69 Dollars


Locals Only T-shirt -Choose one of our many exclusive t-shirts this summer we designed just for you. - 100 Dollars




Locals Only Hat -Very special original trucker hats come at very special original prices. Imagine you with THIS hat slurping on a cold cruiser (beer) at the end of the day. Personally, we can’t stop thinking about it. - 100 Dollars


Surf 101 - T-Shirt, ORIGINAL WORN-TIN cassette tape with never before post-pandemic bops, and a secret clip I mean, it’s like joining a club. Just a club you have to pay for. There’s a few good ones like that I think! -101 Dollars 

 A Pure Stoker - wowza! You don’t even have to buy us dinner first. -Name in the credits (you essentially would be a movie star) -signed script from cast&crew (could be worth 270 dollars one day)-sizzle clip EXCLUSIVE -LOCALS ONLY HAT & T-SHIRT
Room 237 -an extra special sneak peek for you horror freaks. Exclusive sneak peek, Original Locals Only Poster, Zoom Watch party, with Cast and Crew and signed poster. - 327 Dollars 

Red Water Cove Local - Blast us back into the past, baby. Cause it’s VHS time. 
This is the dopest perk of all. You snag our hat, shirt, you will also receive a digital and VHS copy of the film and an exclusive early look at the movie, a poster 
 This might just be worth writing home about. - 550 Dollars Executive Producer

Get the full-on Hollywood IMDB experience and be a credited ""Executive Producer"" for the next cult horror classic.  - 1000 Dollars


 
                        

Not to be tacky or anything but cinema changes lives. Especially right now. I’ll elaborate, don’t worry. With the world being the way it is right now, we take a lot of pride in being able to create something that people can look forward to. Locals Only is as much of a classically themed film as it is one with new laughs, new talent, and new summer nostalgia. As filmmakers, it’s our duty to make some light out of this insane situation we are in. We just need a little extra help getting there. (That’s where you guys come in.)
Our team is really good at making films on a budget (and making them look really good). We have taken some ambitious risks in the past. (i.e., Traveling to the ghost towns of Southern California, as well as packing up our entire crew to shoot a feature in small-town Virginia.) Our crew is great at adapting to whatever is thrown their way.

Although it’s easy to say we are all “self-made” it would be silly not to account for the ways that IndieGoGo and other sister networks alike have paved the way to our successes. As independent filmmakers, we rely on the kindness of people like you (who are hopefully still reading this) to join our team and help us make this film happen.  
We strive for excellence, kindness, and shared perspectives. We want to make movies that help further the expansion of cinema (and give you all something to get your mind off the impending doom of the world).

<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>We are deep in pre-production for a Proof of Concept short film titled, ""Within I."" The short film will serve as a visual representation of the narrative story to help us promote and include with our treatment for a web-series of the same story and universe of, ""Within I."" Having gone through so much schooling and learning from experience as any new filmmaker, this project is a passion project with hopes of becoming more than that and representing a protagonist that is underrepresented in mainstream TV and streaming platforms; those who grew up with social and mental struggles as they navigate the world. By supporting us, you are helping many of us on the cast and crew reach a new level in our creative endeavors and our future success. We appreciate any and all your support! Do you want to know more?<br/> </p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>A secluded young woman running away from her life’s problems suddenly finds herself with the ability to travel into her subconscious mind. Meeting her subconscious there, the world within her mind reflects the struggles of an introverted life and becoming an adult in the real world. As problems never go away on their own, she learns that something darker is always present and that she may have to learn to take life head on.<br/> </p>
<h3>Director’s Statement</h3>
<p>We often need to take a break from life to figure things out in a world of noise but we can never escape it so we try to adapt and find a way to overcome it. This noise can be anything from work, personal, private life struggles and our own health. Growing up, I was the kid that would become friends with everyone and well liked. Until I moved to a new district for high school, I was on my own trying to figure out who I was like most teenagers. As the first generation of my family born in the states, a minority, it was almost impossible to talk to my family about my struggles because the culture and society is different than what they grew up in. Navigating relationships with people, it was apparent that I was mostly alone with no one I could trust to help me navigate my high school years. This project is important to me as it tells the story of a protagonist whose struggles with social anxiety and finding a place for oneself to belong takes her to consult the only person they could talk to, her own subconscious. As she interacts with her subconscious to learn ways to cope with and figure out life, she will learn to grow from each experience to tackle life head on.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Characters of ""Within, I""</h3>
<p><strong><i>GABRIELLE </i></strong>- She enjoys reading books and letting her imagination go in drawings. She is introverted with little social skills. Does not have any friends and often just feels lonely but still pushes on in life. A college Freshman at a local community college she lives at home and has not achieved many of what others her age have such as a driving license, having a car, or even making any significant friends or relationships with others. She works at a small library close to home where she learns more about the world than from her own Dad. There is a fear inside her that she can not understand as she reaches for her own independence becoming an adult.</p>

We are deep in pre-production for a Proof of Concept short film titled, ""Within I."" The short film will serve as a visual representation of the narrative story to help us promote and include with our treatment for a web-series of the same story and universe of, ""Within I."" Having gone through so much schooling and learning from experience as any new filmmaker, this project is a passion project with hopes of becoming more than that and representing a protagonist that is underrepresented in mainstream TV and streaming platforms; those who grew up with social and mental struggles as they navigate the world. By supporting us, you are helping many of us on the cast and crew reach a new level in our creative endeavors and our future success. We appreciate any and all your support! Do you want to know more? 
The Story
A secluded young woman running away from her life’s problems suddenly finds herself with the ability to travel into her subconscious mind. Meeting her subconscious there, the world within her mind reflects the struggles of an introverted life and becoming an adult in the real world. As problems never go away on their own, she learns that something darker is always present and that she may have to learn to take life head on. 
Director’s Statement
We often need to take a break from life to figure things out in a world of noise but we can never escape it so we try to adapt and find a way to overcome it. This noise can be anything from work, personal, private life struggles and our own health. Growing up, I was the kid that would become friends with everyone and well liked. Until I moved to a new district for high school, I was on my own trying to figure out who I was like most teenagers. As the first generation of my family born in the states, a minority, it was almost impossible to talk to my family about my struggles because the culture and society is different than what they grew up in. Navigating relationships with people, it was apparent that I was mostly alone with no one I could trust to help me navigate my high school years. This project is important to me as it tells the story of a protagonist whose struggles with social anxiety and finding a place for oneself to belong takes her to consult the only person they could talk to, her own subconscious. As she interacts with her subconscious to learn ways to cope with and figure out life, she will learn to grow from each experience to tackle life head on. 
The Characters of ""Within, I""
GABRIELLE - She enjoys reading books and letting her imagination go in drawings. She is introverted with little social skills. Does not have any friends and often just feels lonely but still pushes on in life. A college Freshman at a local community college she lives at home and has not achieved many of what others her age have such as a driving license, having a car, or even making any significant friends or relationships with others. She works at a small library close to home where she learns more about the world than from her own Dad. There is a fear inside her that she can not understand as she reaches for her own independence becoming an adult.
 
SUBCONSCIOUS GABRIELLE - Takes the appearance of Gabrielle but in costume from the books that Gabrielle reads, stories she has heard or drawings she made. Has the same struggles that Gabrielle does and is always on a task to complete, find, or discover something related to Gabrielle’s life.
 
JOHN (DAD) - Over protective of Gabrielle and does not think she is capable on her own. Feels the need to make decisions for her and keep her close. Also does not want her to grow up with fears he will then be alone just like how his wife left them. He is a failing writer and artist always trying to make the next best hit but has a small following if any.
 
THE BEAST - Always has a physical form of either a creature or person that Gabrielle knows from the real world or from the books she reads. It always makes itself present though often it does not make itself appear until there is an imminent need to make a decision on a problem in Gabrielle’s life.
 
THE SUBCONSCIOUS WORLD - This is a place that only makes itself visible to Gabrielle. As she navigates through life, this world takes on a different look and feel. From a safe, calm and comforting place, to then a strange and sometimes dark place; her mind changes as she experiences life and the struggles it comes with.

Throughout my life I have always been fascinated by the dynamics of friend groups and the toxicity we often endure for the sake of companionship. This is what WESTWARD, HO! mainly explores. Through this short, I am also seeking a type of truth, which comes from an honest representation of these addicting, but fraught relationships. Where do they stand in our grand personal histories? And at what point does one decide a friendship hurts more than it heals?I want to be part of a new era of independent filmmaking that prioritizes collaboration, inclusivity, and pushing the needle forward, not just on screen but also off. Although I am still in the early stages of my career, I am determined to foster that environment now. I am elated to say that our cast and crew reflects that ethos, being a majority of female and non-binary artists.The only large, fortified wall preventing us from actualizing this dream are those pesky dollars. Which is why I am here today, in that classic NPR fundraising drive way, to ask if you would contribute to our funding and help bring this film to life. -Khana TillmanSTORY PREMISEPoppy, a semi successful influencer, reunites with college friends in the desert to scatter her cat’s ashes.

<p><i>A painful breakup prompts Grace to visit her friend Liv who is living in the idyllic English countryside with her boyfriend Edward and his dog Polly. The trio start the weekend in high spirits but dark revelations soon cascade the short lived happiness into chaos.</i></p>
<p><strong>'HELP</strong>' is a psychological thriller that has been shot in its entirety on a single location in Somerset England. That's right... <strong>WE DID IT!</strong> Our new found backers from our previously successful Indiegogo campaigns helped us cover all the costs of pre production and filming. As you can see from our official trailer we were able to bring together a talented team who captured a high quality drama.  We want to go one step further and deliver a memorable film to our backers and fans. We have launched this <strong>'FINAL PUSH'</strong> campaign to allow us to bring on board a Composer, Sound Designer a VFX artist and cover festival entries.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","What is 'HELP'?
'HELP' is the debut feature film from multi award winning filmmaker Blake Ridder.
A painful breakup prompts Grace to visit her friend Liv who is living in the idyllic English countryside with her boyfriend Edward and his dog Polly. The trio start the weekend in high spirits but dark revelations soon cascade the short lived happiness into chaos.
'HELP' is a psychological thriller that has been shot in its entirety on a single location in Somerset England. That's right... WE DID IT! Our new found backers from our previously successful Indiegogo campaigns helped us cover all the costs of pre production and filming. As you can see from our official trailer we were able to bring together a talented team who captured a high quality drama.  We want to go one step further and deliver a memorable film to our backers and fans. We have launched this 'FINAL PUSH' campaign to allow us to bring on board a Composer, Sound Designer a VFX artist and cover festival entries. 


Why are we making this film & the impact  

First and foremost we fundamentally believe in the power of good storytelling , unique characters and stunning visuals. We want you to be a member of  the 'Help Family' so together we will get viewers talking long after the credits roll. We know we can make this impactful because we are making films we want to see. 'HELP' will have a worldwide distribution in 2021 so like minded movie lovers can get a taste for what is to come from Ridder Films in the future.

<h3>I’ve tried to write about my relationship with my dad several times over the last few years.</h3>
<p>Each story has morphed into something else. I was too close to the subject material emotionally to tell a story that could resonate as I intended, too young to understand the toll my father’s actions had taken on me, and too bitter to be objective. I’m ready to tell the story of alcoholism’s toxicity to children of addicts now.  The film I will make is about a recovering alcoholic father and his daughter trying to connect but having little common ground on which to stand. </p>
<p>I haven’t talked to my dad in some time as a way of protecting myself, but often wonder what our relationship would look like if he were sober.  In examining the complexities of addiction and family dynamics, I want to reach others dealing with similar situations as well as those experiencing other family dysfunction with similar harm done. I want to address the reality that recovery is not linear,  neither or the alcoholic nor for their family.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603553419/efnnxbuc6bi2acr5em3t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Alcoholism is a disease, often treated as a choice in society and in film.</h3>
<p>The dynamic between an alcoholic and their child is complex, and different in every situation. The disconnect that children of alcoholics can feel with addict parents and their ability to disassociate in moments of emotional discomfort creates another layer to the performance of the actors in my script. As a director, I plan to examine these dynamics with the actors while helping them create a superficial familiarity, we can then play the complex dynamic on several emotional levels.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Making a film is expensive. There are a lot of hidden costs and hoops to jump through. This is where you come in. All of the funds raised will go directly to production and post production for this film. </p>
<ul>
<li>My fundraising goal is hefty. Most of the funds will go towards physical production: paying cast and crew, renting locations, feeding my cast and crew, renting equipment, permits and insurance. The rest will go towards post production: editing, sound, festival entries, marketing.</li>
<li>In the event we do not reach our entire goal, I will cut where I can. I did go to film school after all. I'm used to working on shoe string budgets and playing multiple roles. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604782207/tfqyjtsjhiwmbg6n8pea.jpg"" src=""""/>

</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is both an ethical and moral challenge to deal fairly with the subject matter of addiction and recovery. Alcoholism  should be presented as any other disease would be; with an unbiased, objective view. I will balance the nuances of the issue. The character who is the recovering alcoholic is dealing with his own demons; his daughter is dealing with the trauma that often manifests in those close to addicts. <strong>Neither character is right or wrong. Neither is flawless or irredeemable.</strong> Both characters’ feelings are valid. I hope to show this dynamic in a restorative way, without exploiting or romanticizing drinking or drunk behavior. I want the film to express that while recovery may be painful, ugly, and messy for everyone involved, it is possible. I want to be authentic and to be fair.</p>

Since joining AAB, Effe has helped with assistant directing, fundraising &amp; casting. She also currently manages the AAB Instagram account.</p>
<p>Effe is a big fan of big-budget fiction (#teamMarvel) but also has a special place in her heart for telling stories that matter, giving voices to those whose own voices may not always be heard. She aspires to one day work on a movie (or two) set in the MCU as well as work on shows for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus.</p>

<p>Aaliyah Roberts is a writer for AAB productions and a current student at California State University Northridge where she will be awarded her Bachelors of Arts in screenwriting this spring. This coming fall she will be pursuing an MFA in screen and television writing at the University of Southern California within their prestigious school of cinematic arts.</p>
<p>Even though Aaliyah’s main focus is in screenwriting she dabbles in all forms of writing such as Poetry, short stories, and plays. No matter what form she is writing in her main goal is to always inspire and uplift her community. Being Black and Mexican she has always felt a strong need to be the voice of these marginalized groups who have interesting and compelling stories but aren’t always acknowledged because they aren’t deemed as marketable to mainstream audiences.</p>
<p>Aaliyah aspires to develop a show for Cartoon Network because she finds representation in children’s programming to be the most impactful as it can teach children racial and gender tolerance at an early age.</p>
<p>Outside of writing Aaliyah enjoys cuddling her cat and binge-watching the latest Shonda Rhimes drama or rewatching adventure time and reminiscing on her childhood days when her biggest worry was finding enough money to buy a bag of hot Cheetos. </p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Shooting a quality product is always a challenge, and now especially with the Covid-19 pandemic. Financial backing is absolutely essential to be able to make this film as with your funding and support, we will be able to cover all the necessities. These include paying the actors and the crew, sourcing props, creating costumes, and all location costs that we will come across. In addition to this, we will be able to source PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) such as Covid-19 testing, masks, hand sanitisers for all our cast and crew working on set. Donating to our project will help to open doors for local film creators and actors in Ghana who may not have the opportunity to make and share stories with the world. We thank you in advance for your support. </p>
<p>Our Rewards for donating are as followed:</p>
<ul>
<li>£10: General digital thank you letter. </li>
<li>£35: Raffle Ticket (Contents: The Hat worn in the film, The Dress worn in the film, 'Our Day' film Hat, and 'Our Day' Film Hoodie. </li>
<li>£100: 'Our Day'  Hoodie </li>
<li>£300; free screening, a hat, a mask, and a hoodie. </li>
<li>£1000 (5 people) - co-producer credit hoodie and hat early digital copy/ ticket of screening </li>
<li>£5000 (2 people) - Executive producer, special thanks at the end of credit, hoodie, hat, early digital copy/. Personalized Thank you letter. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>When we see black people on screen they are always struggling. Struggling to get out the hood, struggling for survival, or struggling in a world that is systematically set up against them. There is nothing wrong with these stories, there is a lot of truth to them but these aren’t our only stories. When AAB Productions think of black people, we think of happiness, strength, fun, laughter, and carefree energy. These are the themes we want to exemplify in our short film. Creating a coming of age story about young black kids exploring their feelings with their first crushes is important because we never see  Black kids being so innocently blissful of the world and people around them.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help bring this idea to fruition and hopefully inspire Black kids around the world because Black children need to know that their life isn’t all about struggle. They are allowed to be young and carefree, and not be so consumed by the evils of the world that unfortunately do surround them.</p>
<p>Our company relates to this story because we too are young Black and Persons of Color who are going into the film world with bright eyes and an unwavering sense of determination and curiosity. This is what being young is all about, taking risks and doing things for the sake of art. We thank you for understanding and can’t wait to make this project happen with your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Some of the challenges and the risk that we will face are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money </li>
<li>Travel </li>
<li>Shooting abroad (not having everyone on the team on location) </li>
<li>We’re all students (some of us graduating) </li>
<li>Going into an industry that doesn’t value our voices </li>
<li>We may not be considered “marketable” (the story)</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>in addition to donating to our film, you can support us by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post on social media </li>
<li>Support the film when it’s released</li>
<li>Follow us on social media (for updates) @aabproductions</li>
</ul>
<p>We thank you all for your support in contributing to our amazing project. You are apart of this production and we value your donations highly.</p>

Writers:

Effe Hozaifeh is a writer for AABproductions. Currently studying English literature at the University of Warwick, Effe has always dreamed of working behind the scenes in the film industry. Since joining AAB, Effe has helped with assistant directing, fundraising & casting. She also currently manages the AAB Instagram account.
Effe is a big fan of big-budget fiction (#teamMarvel) but also has a special place in her heart for telling stories that matter, giving voices to those whose own voices may not always be heard. She aspires to one day work on a movie (or two) set in the MCU as well as work on shows for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus.
Outside of film she has her own hair page @trustyourcurls on Instagram, TikTok & Pinterest (@trustyourcurlsofficial).

Aaliyah Roberts is a writer for AAB productions and a current student at California State University Northridge where she will be awarded her Bachelors of Arts in screenwriting this spring. This coming fall she will be pursuing an MFA in screen and television writing at the University of Southern California within their prestigious school of cinematic arts.
Even though Aaliyah’s main focus is in screenwriting she dabbles in all forms of writing such as Poetry, short stories, and plays. No matter what form she is writing in her main goal is to always inspire and uplift her community. Being Black and Mexican she has always felt a strong need to be the voice of these marginalized groups who have interesting and compelling stories but aren’t always acknowledged because they aren’t deemed as marketable to mainstream audiences.
Aaliyah aspires to develop a show for Cartoon Network because she finds representation in children’s programming to be the most impactful as it can teach children racial and gender tolerance at an early age.
Outside of writing Aaliyah enjoys cuddling her cat and binge-watching the latest Shonda Rhimes drama or rewatching adventure time and reminiscing on her childhood days when her biggest worry was finding enough money to buy a bag of hot Cheetos.

The Impact
When we see black people on screen they are always struggling. Struggling to get out the hood, struggling for survival, or struggling in a world that is systematically set up against them. There is nothing wrong with these stories, there is a lot of truth to them but these aren’t our only stories. When AAB Productions think of black people, we think of happiness, strength, fun, laughter, and carefree energy. These are the themes we want to exemplify in our short film. Creating a coming of age story about young black kids exploring their feelings with their first crushes is important because we never see  Black kids being so innocently blissful of the world and people around them.
Your contribution will help bring this idea to fruition and hopefully inspire Black kids around the world because Black children need to know that their life isn’t all about struggle. They are allowed to be young and carefree, and not be so consumed by the evils of the world that unfortunately do surround them.
Our company relates to this story because we too are young Black and Persons of Color who are going into the film world with bright eyes and an unwavering sense of determination and curiosity. This is what being young is all about, taking risks and doing things for the sake of art. We thank you for understanding and can’t wait to make this project happen with your help.
 
Risks & Challenges
Some of the challenges and the risk that we will face are:

Money 
Travel 
Shooting abroad (not having everyone on the team on location) 
We’re all students (some of us graduating) 
Going into an industry that doesn’t value our voices 
We may not be considered “marketable” (the story)

<p><b>As mentioned, your money will go towards all aspects of production, but here's some more specifics to put your mind at ease. ..</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Locations:</strong> The film features 4 key and distinct locations, including one which will have to be a purpose-built set (which we're very excited about). The costs of using, insuring, travelling to, building and dressing these, sets all costs. So a large portion of the money will be going towards making this possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Costumes: </strong>With a diverse roster of characters, each with their own unique look and none more so than our protagonist Max. We want to create a custom and sleek looking motion capture suit for Max to wear throughout the film. The mesh of Holograms and Motion Capture is at the core of the film's narrative, so we want this costume to be a seamless centrepiece. The design, development and maintenance of the costumes will all be funded by your support. </li>
<li>
<strong>Food: </strong>Often overlooked, but still an important part of our budget, is having the money to feed our cast and crew. A hungry set is a grumpy set and we need everyone at the top of their game, to give you all the film you deserve. So a portion of a budget will go towards on set catering, so we can keep those talented bellies full.</li>
<li>
<strong>VFX: </strong>We want to push our VFX and mesh reality and CGI seamlessly to immerse you all in the story. We are planning on using multiple plug-ins and elements to make this happen which all cost. We're also treading new ground by integrating AI machine learning to aid a VFX pipeline. Check out this pioneering software here: <a href=""https://runwayml.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://runwayml.com/</a>

<strong>Distribution: </strong>Once the film is done, the work doesn't stop. Getting our film to you and other costs. We are planning on employing a Sales Agent with our funds to get our films to festivals and on screens around the world. As well as hosting our own premiere in Bristol and London and releasing the original soundtrack on music streaming platforms.</li>

<h2>""Deep Clean""</h2>
<p>Before you read this. Watch our teaser trailer, linked above, which provides some backstory to the world we are inhabiting in our filmic universe.</p>
<p>Through contributing to this subversive and challenging narrative, you are aiding us in bringing forth our team's vision to the big screen. Here are some key points about our film:</p>
<ul>
<li>Based in and around London, UK</li>
<li>Made by up and coming artists who are breakthrough talents within their respective fields </li>
<li>Will be a project aimed at supporting students breaking through into the film industry by providing opportunities in a number of roles.</li>
<li>The team are ambitious and are aiming high: in particular through a fruitful festival run and the potential for awards.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what is this whole story about?</p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Set in a world where the state of your soul is visible to everyone through large black stains that materialise on your clothing.  You can visit laundrettes in order to wash your soul free from the pain harboured in everyday life. These institutions both remove the black stains from your clothes, making you appear visibly cleansed however, also free you from the pain associated with the actions that caused your soul to be blackened and thus also morally cleanse you.  This of course comes at a hefty monetary fee.  </p>
<p>Our main Character Soap is a frequent of these locations and is beginning to feel the negative consequences of ""over-washing"" your soul. The film follows him as he journeys through this dystopia trying to break free from the ""rat race"" society has imposed on him. Taking steps to break the cycle and become an individual again.</p>
<h2>Intention</h2>
<p>The world we created raises multiple moral questions that we seek to address through our film.</p>
<ul>
<li>How would people behave if they were no longer morally reprehensible for their actions?</li>
<li>How would peoples outward appearances change due to the impact of your soul being visible to everyone, would there be a pressure to always appear clean?</li>
<li>What would happen if you could not afford to use these specialised laundrettes, would emotions such as guilt, anxiety and pain be emotions exclusively imposed on the poorer members of society?</li>
<li>Who would be exploited in this societal structure?</li>
<li>Would there be much change at all?</li>
</ul>
<p>We delve deeper and provide our interpretations to these questions through the dynamics presented between the characters in our script however, we aim for our film to make YOU think and question your own responses to these stimuli. </p>

<h2>Meet The Team</h2>
<h3>Luis Conte: Director, Co-Writer</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632745628/jgwneg6atyocy96zmdyq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Luis is an Anglo-Italian film writer and director. He is particularly interested in producing screen content that challenges the status quo and that seeks to encourage positive changes in the world. He thrives within the subversive and has a particular interest in works containing magical realism as a vehicle to explore larger world defining concepts. Coming from the background of an undergraduate degree in English Literature from one of the top universities in the country, he possesses a skill set that allows him to understand the deeper nuances within art and explore them with greater care. Luis also has experience directing music videos for up-and-coming artists; advertisements for large commercial brands such as Lush, and narrative fiction, that he has both written and been given. He is ambitious and has an innate desire to be successful. He is most certainly someone who should be on your “one to watch list.”</p>
<h3>Federico Arosio: Producer</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632745717/fuasngnavt2crjextyqm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Federico is an Italian film producer from Milan. He is particularly interested in producing films that reflect the wider world and societal issues through a plethora of unique voices. He has studied in multiple countries across Europe as well as explored large parts of South America with just himself and his backpack. This has grounded him and given him worldly experiences that he can draw upon in the production room. Fede (as he likes to be called), has also set up and ran his own production company back in Rome, called “Elodia Cinematografica” and as a result has produced and been crew on several projects in the Italian film world. He also has a master’s degree in law, which gives him the materials to embark on the more formal processes of filmmaking with skill and efficiency.</p>
<h3>Giulio Amendolagine: Director of Photography</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632746319/a78jt1nd0gai6fgztxpf.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>Giulio is an Italian Cinematographer who is currently living in England. He is particularly interested in character driven stories that utilise surrealism or magical realism to deliver a message about the current composition of the world today. Giulio has a diverse portfolio working alongside several directors: filming scenes for narrative, interviews and adverts and has a strong diverse skill set. He has experience with both professional and non-professional actors and thrives in the challenges of making a film. Giulio is a previous co-collaborator with Luis shooting interviews for the large commercial brand Lush, and thus they are keen to work together again.<br/>Link to showreel: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/577184197"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://vimeo.com/577184197</a></p>

<p>Raphael is a London based creative who has several completed scripts to his name. He mainly writes crime fiction, thrillers and action-based narratives. He likes to underpin his narratives with a stringent social lens which can only be honed by living in South London. He aims to appeal to people who fall under the category of Millennial/Gen Z by evoking a sense of modernity within his writing, challenging issues that are current and prominent within our world today. He has decided to team up with Luis and co-write this narrative as an expression of their combined view of today’s political landscape and how perhaps people of their age can stand up and make a difference.</p>
<h2>Style</h2>
<p>The film is to adopt a style inspired by several social defining films of their time. The depiction of the world will be centred in a gritty naturalism and focus on the harsh realities of everyday life.</p>

<p>The film will be a part of the British filmmaking tradition and therefore, it will look and sound like the people who inhabit the home nations.

<p>When I was twelve years old, I had my palm read by a psychic. She predicted that I would have 4 children and that I would live half a life. As a child, it can be traumatizing to hear an adult tell you, you won't live a full life. I had no reason not to believe her, so the constant thought that I won’t grow old stuck in the back of my mind. Even if I wasn’t vocal about it to my parents or friends, it was something that I thought about constantly. How could someone tell a twelve-year-old boy that they weren’t going to live a full life? Did she not like my shirt or my haircut? As I grew up my beliefs changed, and I realized that it is impossible to determine somebody’s life for them and that the only outcomes that are decided are the ones that you make on your own.</p>
<p> I still think about the psychic’s words to this day and the idea of prophecies. That anxiousness as a child traveled from me into “The Letter”. When I initially had the idea of a letter arriving at your front door that holds your future, I thought it was crazy. There were so many complications with the actual premise, that you couldn’t possibly turn it into something that people would find meaningful. The question I constantly had to keep asking myself was that if I were in Robin’s (our protagonist) position, would I open it? Would others?</p>
<p>I’ve asked this question to friends and family and everyone had different answers. For me, I don’t think I would. There is a lot of pressure on children to grow up and I think everyone is affected by this in one way or another. I remember being 18 years old like Robin is and being in that position, minus the fortune-telling letter. I had to make a decision that would lead me on a path I would have to follow for the rest of my life. I can feel her anxiety as I read the script and I know how hard it is to make a decision so big, especially as a decisive person. I now know what I would go back and tell myself, to take a breath and to trust my heart, which is something that I always saw Robin doing in every version of this story that has been written or worked.</p>
<p>I see a lot of similarities between Robin and me. Both of us have a lot of dreams and aspirations. We have high expectations of our lives and I think that we share some of the same problems that I had growing up. I think it made the entire writing process easy to be able to relate it to James and I's experiences. Hopefully with that, the audience will be able to connect to this wild and dark world that we’ve created. </p>

<h3>Our Film</h3>
<p>Our film is about Kyle and Jodie. Two people who after meeting online organize a hook-up where they hope to explore some sexual boundaries through BDSM sex. This does not according to Plan as Kyles has lied about his experience and him not telling Jodie how little he knows puts her in an unfortunate situation as he causes an accident taking them to A&amp;E.</p>
<p>Together in the waiting room, Kyle and Jodie have a heart to heart as they discuss what this means for the future of their relationship and the importance of consent and communicating with your partner.</p>

<p>The film has many influences including the film Skeleton Twins (2014), where the image above is from, and which inspired some visual cues for the final film. Other influences include <i>Good Dick (2005)</i> by Mariana Palka and <i>In the Mood for Love</i> (2000) by Wong Kar-Wei. Both films have a raw and unflinching honesty and intimacy about relationships that have helped to inspire the stories approach to sensitive topics such as sex, consent, and trauma.</p>
<p>We hope to explore these topics in a way without judgment and which helps to educate people on how mistakes that seem small and spiral out of control. Making things worse for both parties and how we can only move past them once they are confronted head-on. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Characters</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Kyle</u></h3>
<p>A young and insecure man wanting to explore his sexuality but is worried he can't live up to his fantasies. He pretends to be more experienced than he is and puts his desires ahead of others. Over the film, he learns humility and the importance of consent after his selfish actions hurt someone he has feelings for.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Jodie</u></h3>
<p>A young woman who is confident in herself but not always others. She wants a relationship but struggles to trust those she cares for and has built a wall of confidence to hide her insecurities. She enjoys teasing and flirting with others but refuses to bend to the will of others if she doesn't want to. With more experience than Kyle, she educates him on the importance of consent </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Who are We</h2>
<p>Collectively we are the team that is hoping to make ""Dolore é Amore"" a reality. A collection of young actors and filmmakers from all over Scotland,  that have gathered behind this project as the first step in what we hope will be long and fruitful careers in the arts. This short student film will not just help some of us to pass our film course, but will also be a calling card. A major project that by going to various short film festivals can help us to bring us to the attention of others and get our foot in the door of the industry we want to work in so badly.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi, this is Charles D. Lincoln, the producer and writer of Theresa and Allison, a feature-length independent horror film, directed by the great Jeremiah Kipp (The Minions, The Sadist, The Day God Slept, Drool, and countless other short horror films) and starring Sarah Schoofs (Gut, Phobia, Meme) and Arielle Hope. Theresa and Allison is the story of Theresa (Hope) who, after a one night stand that turns disastrous, finds herself drawn into a downward spiral of savagery and brutality, all the while tempted by the beautiful and immortal Allison (Schoofs). It's a supernatural horror story with a modern twist. Uncompromising but intelligent. Bloody but character-driven. And above all, a tribute to the darker films that helped shape our creativity while, at the same time, aiming to do new things within old genres.</p>
<p>Inspired by films like Martyrs, the Hunger, Let the Right One In, and Hellraiser, our main  goal is to create a feature-length film on an indie budget that does not look like it was made on an indie budget. We have a great crew, talented actors and actresses, and a director with a strong vision. We want to show that an inexpensive film does not need to look like it was put together with safety scissors and scotch tape and that if the people behind the film truly believe in what they are doing, they can make something that looks like it costs ten times the amount it really does. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have shot three days of footage, and one day of reshoots, at a cost of $5,000, compiled by all of my personal savings and additional contributions from friends and family. To finish the rest of the film, we need $25,000. We are setting the goal here at $5,000 for several reasons. First, because we want to be able to use as large a percentage of the money as possible. If we go for $25k and don't make that, we still have to give them 9% of what we made. If we go for a smaller number, that will still help, like $5,000, then we only have to give them 4%. Second, while it does not give us everything we need, it gives us enough to start reshooting within the next few weeks. We won't be able to finish the film on $5,000, but it'll get us another three or four days in the can.</p> <ul> <li>It will cost us, roughly $750 a day for our crew, which is small  and consists of people willing to work for much less than they are worth, just because they love the project. On days where we need special effects, that's an additional $200 per day for our special effects artist, with costs of materials extra. We estimate we'd need an additional 10 days of shooting to finish the film. That brings us up to $7,500 for just for the crew, plus about $3,000 in special effects (there is a party scene at the end of the film that will require quite a lot of special effects). We also have to pay for locations; the cast, which consists of not just the talented Arielle and Sarah, but several wonderful actresses from the worlds of New York independent film and stage, like Amy Jo Jackson (Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson) and Pooya Mohseni; and for feeding everyone, which comes out to about a $100 a day, even more during the two days where our big party climax scene is being shot; and we also need an additional $1,500 for supplies and non-prosthetic props.</li> <li>The last $5,000 is so we can pay off the initial investors and go into this completely debt free. </li>
<li>If we end up not getting what we need, then I guess we will do as much as we can afford and then rethink things from there. This film means a whole lot to a lot of people and to let it just end for lack of funding would be tragic.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The fact is that the studio system that exists in Hollywood today does not support this type of film. The days of the classic horror of the 70's and even, to a lesser extent, the 80's, is done for the current days of PG-13, sanitized fare. We want to offer an alternative to that, at the same time, not flinching from any of the more ""unsavory"" aspects of horror. We are not afraid of blood or gore or nudity or uncomfortable subject matter. Why must one choose between a well-written, well- acted story and the primal thrill that comes with seeing our worst fears come to life, onscreen?

<div>Thank you for reading this and thank you, in advance, for helping us out.</div> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary Hi, this is Charles D. Lincoln, the producer and writer of Theresa and Allison, a feature-length independent horror film, directed by the great Jeremiah Kipp (The Minions, The Sadist, The Day God Slept, Drool, and countless other short horror films) and starring Sarah Schoofs (Gut, Phobia, Meme) and Arielle Hope. Theresa and Allison is the story of Theresa (Hope) who, after a one night stand that turns disastrous, finds herself drawn into a downward spiral of savagery and brutality, all the while tempted by the beautiful and immortal Allison (Schoofs). It's a supernatural horror story with a modern twist. Uncompromising but intelligent. Bloody but character-driven. And above all, a tribute to the darker films that helped shape our creativity while, at the same time, aiming to do new things within old genres.
Inspired by films like Martyrs, the Hunger, Let the Right One In, and Hellraiser, our main  goal is to create a feature-length film on an indie budget that does not look like it was made on an indie budget. We have a great crew, talented actors and actresses, and a director with a strong vision. We want to show that an inexpensive film does not need to look like it was put together with safety scissors and scotch tape and that if the people behind the film truly believe in what they are doing, they can make something that looks like it costs ten times the amount it really does.    What We Need & What You Get We have shot three days of footage, and one day of reshoots, at a cost of $5,000, compiled by all of my personal savings and additional contributions from friends and family. To finish the rest of the film, we need $25,000. We are setting the goal here at $5,000 for several reasons. First, because we want to be able to use as large a percentage of the money as possible. If we go for $25k and don't make that, we still have to give them 9% of what we made. If we go for a smaller number, that will still help, like $5,000, then we only have to give them 4%. Second, while it does not give us everything we need, it gives us enough to start reshooting within the next few weeks. We won't be able to finish the film on $5,000, but it'll get us another three or four days in the can.  It will cost us, roughly $750 a day for our crew, which is small  and consists of people willing to work for much less than they are worth, just because they love the project. On days where we need special effects, that's an additional $200 per day for our special effects artist, with costs of materials extra. We estimate we'd need an additional 10 days of shooting to finish the film. That brings us up to $7,500 for just for the crew, plus about $3,000 in special effects (there is a party scene at the end of the film that will require quite a lot of special effects). We also have to pay for locations; the cast, which consists of not just the talented Arielle and Sarah, but several wonderful actresses from the worlds of New York independent film and stage, like Amy Jo Jackson (Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson) and Pooya Mohseni; and for feeding everyone, which comes out to about a $100 a day, even more during the two days where our big party climax scene is being shot; and we also need an additional $1,500 for supplies and non-prosthetic props. The last $5,000 is so we can pay off the initial investors and go into this completely debt free. 
If we end up not getting what we need, then I guess we will do as much as we can afford and then rethink things from there. This film means a whole lot to a lot of people and to let it just end for lack of funding would be tragic.    The Impact The fact is that the studio system that exists in Hollywood today does not support this type of film. The days of the classic horror of the 70's and even, to a lesser extent, the 80's, is done for the current days of PG-13, sanitized fare. We want to offer an alternative to that, at the same time, not flinching from any of the more ""unsavory"" aspects of horror. We are not afraid of blood or gore or nudity or uncomfortable subject matter. Why must one choose between a well-written, well- acted story and the primal thrill that comes with seeing our worst fears come to life, onscreen? Theresa and Allison was written to give both, but we cannot do it without you.  Films like this are not being made by a studio system that is too afraid of offending people or working above the lowest common denominator. By supporting us, you show that you want better than what it currently out there To do something like this, you cannot have people who do not know what they're doing. Our cast and crew are professional artists of the highest order.  Foremost of this crew, Jeremiah Kipp's directing credits include THE SADIST starring Tom Savini, MASTERMIND starring Chris Sarandon, EDWARD ALBEE:THE TRANSFORMATIVE MOMENT starring Mercedes Ruehl, THE POD starring Larry Fessenden, BAGGAGE (Audience Award - Macabre Faire), CONTACT (commissioned by Sinister Six annual screening series), THE DAYS GOD SLEPT (Best Director -Horror Hound 2014), CRESTFALLEN, THE CHRISTMAS PARTY (Cannes and Clermont-Ferrand), EASY PREY (commissioned by NYC's annual VisionFest), DROOL (commissioned by Mandragoras Art Space), SNAPSHOT and THE APARTMENT (commissioned by Canon to premiere their XL2 at DV Expo 2004). Producing credits include the feature films SATAN HATES YOU (created by Glass Eye Pix, starring Angus Scrimm, Michael Berryman and Reggie Bannister), GOD'S LAND, LET'S PLAY, IN MONTAUK, THE JONESTOWN DEFENSE and THE BED-THING (directed by Pulitzer Prize-nominated Matt Zoller Seitz). Assistant director credits include I SELL THE DEAD starring Dominic Monaghan, SOMEWHERE TONIGHT starring John Turturro, ONE NIGHT starring Melissa Leo, and the Sundance Award-winning MAN (dir: Myna Joseph).




Some of Jeremiah's accolades: ""This haunting and experimental film is full of vivid imagery and fantastic music. Jeremiah Kipp shows some real talent in juxtaposing the beautiful with the morose, barraging the viewer with imagery both gorgeous and nightmarish. Kipp relies on weird images and amazing music to force your mind to put together what’s going on. The results are pretty moving."" - Ain't It Cool News

""It's a beautifully made film -- I loved the mouth tunnel!  In fact, I think I did that drug once upon a time. Excellent.  Keep makin' em!""

<br/>
</div>Outreach is really important to Dweeb Darlings and part of that includes not only casting diverse actors but also bringing awareness to social issues. Season 2 will have even more emphasis on this. We have an exciting roster of diverse characters joining the Double D's. This season we are also introducing accomplished and talented female directors to our team. Part of the Dweeb Darlings outreach program includes their touring panel #SPARK Your
Creativity: A Call To Action. Ladies Unite to Create More Female Driven Content (Appearing at San Diego Comic Con July 11, 2015). While <i>Stalking LeVar</i> is the crown jewel of Dweeb Darlings we are constantly working with emerging talent to help cultivate their projects under the umbrella of our production company.</div><div>

<p>Creating a series is difficult, it requires a lot of people to help. When you watch the finished project you may not be able to see how your contribution is spent. So, Let us break it down for you. <br/><br/>We have 10 episodes in Season 2, $10,000 breaks down to $1000 an episode. </p>
<p>$100 a day is for food (The most important thing we can provide our actors and crew with is healthy fuel so that we can work hard and provide great content)</p>
<p>$100 locations (Where we shoot is really important to how the episode turns out, while we can get locations donated for free, we still have security to use the space)</p>
<p>$300 equipment rental (Microphones, cameras and lights are not cheap to buy, it's easier to rent them but it's also an expense)</p>
<p>$500 crew &amp; post production (Our crew is wonderful and hard working we would love to be able to show the dozens of amazing people that are making Stalking LeVar that their work is valuable by paying them for their time)</p>While our perks are really exciting the best perk is knowing that your donation is making a real difference in our production. Your $100 donation is providing meals for the people on set or your $300 donation is ensuring we have great sound. <br/><br/>If our goal is not met we can still proceed in making some episodes of Season 2. <br/>We produced the first season with a lot of hugs and high fives. <br/><br/><p></p>

Dweeb Darlings is a production company founded by Heidi Cox and Megan Green. It
seeks to give opportunities to female creators and female fronted story lines through original
content and social outreach. The Double D's (as they like to call themselves) mission is to
empower women and girls by showing them that being a dweeb, geek, and/or nerd can not only
mean being intelligent but also, powerful, creative, feminine, sexy, and fun!

Stalking LeVar 


This comedic scripted series is about life, love, liberty, and the pursuit of ultimate
friendship with LeVar Burton. It stars Heidi Cox (Creator of the series) as Heidi and features
producer Stephanie Pressman (Host of Geek 360 and Fashionably Nerdy) as Susan her
somewhat misplaced sidekick after Heidi's partner (played by Co-Creator Megan Green)
disappears down under. Outreach & Awareness



Outreach is really important to Dweeb Darlings and part of that includes not only casting diverse actors but also bringing awareness to social issues. Season 2 will have even more emphasis on this. We have an exciting roster of diverse characters joining the Double D's. This season we are also introducing accomplished and talented female directors to our team. Part of the Dweeb Darlings outreach program includes their touring panel #SPARK Your
Creativity: A Call To Action. Ladies Unite to Create More Female Driven Content (Appearing at San Diego Comic Con July 11, 2015). While Stalking LeVar is the crown jewel of Dweeb Darlings we are constantly working with emerging talent to help cultivate their projects under the umbrella of our production company.
   Where Your Contribution Will Be Spent
Creating a series is difficult, it requires a lot of people to help. When you watch the finished project you may not be able to see how your contribution is spent. So, Let us break it down for you. We have 10 episodes in Season 2, $10,000 breaks down to $1000 an episode. 
$100 a day is for food (The most important thing we can provide our actors and crew with is healthy fuel so that we can work hard and provide great content)
$100 locations (Where we shoot is really important to how the episode turns out, while we can get locations donated for free, we still have security to use the space)
$300 equipment rental (Microphones, cameras and lights are not cheap to buy, it's easier to rent them but it's also an expense)
$500 crew & post production (Our crew is wonderful and hard working we would love to be able to show the dozens of amazing people that are making Stalking LeVar that their work is valuable by paying them for their time)While our perks are really exciting the best perk is knowing that your donation is making a real difference in our production. Your $100 donation is providing meals for the people on set or your $300 donation is ensuring we have great sound. If our goal is not met we can still proceed in making some episodes of Season 2. We produced the first season with a lot of hugs and high fives. 
Perks!
Signed postcard. Just a little ""Thank You"" note from the ladies along with some sticker swag.

Extra Special Weekly Perks
In addition to the perks listed Every Monday During Our Campaign we will announce a special perk of the week on our Facebook page & Twitter Account for Dweeb Darlings.

Your weekly perks will be fulfilled and announced live on periscope the following Sunday. For those that qualify for this perk - they are only eligible for the perk the week they contribute. However, you will re-qualify if you contribute again. 

    Risks & Challenges  We hate asking for money especially in an age when we are all bombarded with invites for crowdfunding campaigns. We realize we may not reach our goal though we are asking for a small production budget, $10,000 is a lot of real world money. We can make this series on pennies, we already have for Season 1. However, given the tools we can do even better.  We have created 4 episodes and 2 mini-sodes previously proving we have the creativity and ability to get this done. By offering special weekly goals we hope to attract you to visit this page and contribute multiple times.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute monetarily, but that doesn't mean that you can't help:  Get the word out, tell your friends, watch the show, share an episode on your social media! There are buttons on this page to click and share this campaign with everyone you know!

Die Konsequenz. My first feature doc was shot during the infamous bathhouse
raids by the Toronto Police Department in1981. Track Two was released at the

untold contributions that we have made to the world over all this time. <b>Out
of History</b> is truly the greatest story that has never been told!</p>
<h4><b>Your Support</b></h4>
<p>Your contribution will be crucial in getting Out of History off
the ground. As a successful producer in documentaries over many years I
understand how crucial it will be for me to demonstrate that the LGBT community
and our friends are behind the project. This support will allow me to finish
the development of this film that I have been researching for many years on my

start in the spring of 2015. I hope to have the film completed one year from
now.</p>
<h4><b>The Legacy</b></h4>
<p></p>
<p><b>Out of History</b> is an ambitious
project that will bring to life over 2,800 years of our history. Using
documentary film and a digital online portal or ‘time tunnel’. Over the next
few years we will be producing a series of documentary films (The Politics of

into the Time Tunnel to create an online experience. This experience will allow
us to travel through our history by centauries or by themes.</p>
<p>While the production of the film will provide the unique
material for <b>Out of History</b>, the true legacy of the project will be the
self-perpetuating digital presence of the historical Time Tunnel. Focusing on
entertainment, politics, travel and health, <b>Out of History </b>will provide
an ever-changing canvas for creating identity within the community. The project
will become a focal point for young people struggling to find their place in
the world as well as travellers looking for an added dimension on their next

histories as well as their reviews of books, movies, music and TV shows.</p>

<p>""RISE is a story of choices. It entails life of a female
immigrant who moved to the land of opportunities to find herself trapped in a
golden cage of fear and domestic abuse. She uses music and dance to reinvent
herself and regain her confidence to make an important choice in her life, which
consequently inspires her abuser to choose a different life path as well. </p>
<p>The story is intended to bring attention to the important
issue of domestic abuse that faces many women and men daily and help them
realize they have a choice to either give in and live in fear or stand up and rise above it. </p>
<p>Domestic abuse is happening around us.  Victims usually stay quiet and keep it a
secret due to either fear or lack of confidence that is mostly created by the
abuser. We are not born abusive so every abuser has a story to tell. The fear
and lack of confidence is not a plague haunting only the victims but in reality
it is the abuser who experiences them first and tries to reflect that on

Production Office - Includes making copies of scripts, call sheets, and other paperwork, and shipping/packaging costs for LaFilmPrize submissions, office supplies, the design/printing/distribution costs of marketing the film, etc.
Indiegogo Fulfillment - Instead of spending on the fulfillment of material perks to our donors, the producers decided to make a direct donation to a group of pre-selected domestic violence non-profit centers around the country that support survivors in terms of clothing, shelter, and living essentials like food, rent and legal costs.
Festival Expenses - The cost associated with festival submission fees, travel and accommodation expenses for the producers to help better spread the word to business and film community leaders who can influence the increase support of domestic violence non-profit centers.

<p>Marcello Nine is a true visionary that believes there's an actor in everyone!  That's why he creates his characters through the actors and actresses, and challenges them to identify with the titles, rather it be a blue collar worker, housewife, or politician. This technique is designed to allow any experienced or aspiring actor/actress to have a fair chance to capture a winning role without having to deal with the drawbacks that many have to face in this industry.
<i>""In this episodic drama I want to challenge (racial) stereotypical perceptions and
boundaries, I want to show how 2 people can look at the same thing and see
something totally different, and sometimes it takes real people to set that example""...</i></p>

we find ourselves asking the question, ""What would make them do
that?""  ""Where are their parents?"" This show tells a story
of corruption, drug, physical and mental abuse, crime, and poverty, while also
telling a story of intelligence, resilience, the good responsible teenager and
adults that go on to be productive members of society. But most importantly,
this series tells the story of how we have the freedom to choose which direction

Vivica A Fox delivers a stunning love or hate her performance as Mayor Morgan Hardaway a 1st term Mayor in Atlanta that believes her purpose in life is to change the perspective of the female role in society by influencing women to separate what they need from what they have been socialized to expect. Starring Vivica A Fox (Set It Off, Independence Day, Kill Bill), Tommy Ford (Martin, Harlem Nights), Roy Jones Jr. (Grudge Match, The Matrix Reloaded), Geffri Maya (Private Practice),  Rodney Perry (The Monique Show, Madea's Big Happy Family), Erica Dixon (Love & Hip Hop Atlanta), Karon Riley (Neccessary Roughness, Marry Us For Christmas), Jeff Trink, April Bogenschutz, Chris ""Set If Off"" Jones, Donald ""Baby D"" Jenkins and many more, Blaq Gold is a raw multicultural TV series drama characterized by complex, multiple stories that demonstrates how institutions like politics, the entertainment industry, the media, and the urban street elements are built from a complex web of relationships and how men and women treat and view each other in its core of the most heightened of circumstances exposing the drama and stupidity of some, but also highlighting the loyalty and resilience of others.. Unlike the black and white worlds of television, Blaq Gold is all grey. Blaq Gold The Series addresses a variety topics including, Politics, Crime, Racism, Domestic Violence, Bullying, Homophobia, Loyalty, Sexism, Love, Hate, etc. This controversial series will have your coffee break chat and social media on fire! This episodic drama will take you on a journey
that reveals the weaknesses and resilience of the individuals that run
this city, and highlight the rewards and consequences of the
choices they make! 


Here's a quick look at some of the amazing actors and the characters they portray on the show! ""I know!"" probably should have shown this one before the trailer but now it gives you a reason to watch the trailer again!      




 
Marcello Nine is a true visionary that believes there's an actor in everyone!  That's why he creates his characters through the actors and actresses, and challenges them to identify with the titles, rather it be a blue collar worker, housewife, or politician. This technique is designed to allow any experienced or aspiring actor/actress to have a fair chance to capture a winning role without having to deal with the drawbacks that many have to face in this industry.
""In this episodic drama I want to challenge (racial) stereotypical perceptions and
boundaries, I want to show how 2 people can look at the same thing and see
something totally different, and sometimes it takes real people to set that example""...
     






If you like the music in the Blaq Gold official trailer, you'll love this guy! We Do!



Recently named ""One of the Best Beat Makers"" by Rolling Stone Magazine, Grammy award winning & multi platinum selling producer DJ Toomp has teamed up with Day 9 Films to create a music score that defines pop culture as heard in the trailer.  As a producer his resume includes Mariah Carey, TI, Jay Z, Rick Ross and Kayne West to name a few. 



Hear from our cast!  Each interview has a sneak peek at some of the scenes. The videos has been downsized to thumbnail view, to watch in full screen double-click the video and don't forget to adjust the quality to HD!
                                                                        
       















Your contribution will help with what is arguably the most important part of creating this show; the production, crew, cast, promotions, etc.  So to be politically correct, that means your donation makes you more than just a contributor, it makes you a member of team Blaq Gold!



We want to create a show that digs deep into the fabric of
our society.  And when we say society I mean more than one nationality,
more than just one culture, more than one class of people.  There are a lot of things that we see on social media and television that is disturbing to us, and
we find ourselves asking the question, ""What would make them do
that?""  ""Where are their parents?"" This show tells a story
of corruption, drug, physical and mental abuse, crime, and poverty, while also
telling a story of intelligence, resilience, the good responsible teenager and
adults that go on to be productive members of society. But most importantly,
this series tells the story of how we have the freedom to choose which direction
we take.  And with your support we can make a quality series and a
powerful story!

I have a true passion for television and radio which has led me to working on many different projects - and Nerd Off is almost like my own child...my own creation.

<p>Way back at the start of October last year (okay, not that long ago) director Matthew along with fellow students Adam and Sophie came up with the idea of a topical quiz show. The basic idea of the show was to be about films and TV shows, and bring people together to test their knowledge. It's such a basic format for a show that we couldn't really understand why it hadn't already been done. At the time, we never really thought we'd do it...just one of those things you think of, but never actually do - well this did happen! We planned and put together the very first episode of the new student made web show ""Nerd Off""!</p>
<p>We have a very talented production team made up of university students that use the excellent studio facilities on offer to us. So, if we have all this, why do we need money? Well - we want to be BETTER.</p>
<p>Your money would help us have better props and more 'decoration' of the set. It would also help us to provide better prizes for our talentedly nerdy contestants! We'd also use it to cover some initial advertising costs in things like magazines, online etc. Your money will ultimately give us the chance to make the show better!</p>

<p>In 2013, Canadian citizens and residents sponsoring their spouses to become permanent residents had a very clear path of two stages to follow.

<p>En 2013, les citoyens et résidents Canadiens qui
parrainaient leur conjoint(e)s afin qu’ils/elles deviennent résident(e)s
permanent(e)s avait une idée très nette des 2 étapes à suivre. Les délais
pour l’étape 1 du programme de parrainage intérieur du Canada étaient de 6
mois, suivis d’un 8 mois additionnel pour la 2<sup>e</sup> étape. En 2014, les
délais pour la première étape ont doublés à 12 mois. En 2015 ils ont presque
triplés à 17 mois, et les délais pour la deuxième étape ont été augmentés à 10
mois, pour un total de 27 mois d’attente.</p>

</div></div>","Synopsys (la version française suit l'anglais)
In 2013, Canadian citizens and residents sponsoring their spouses to become permanent residents had a very clear path of two stages to follow. Processing times for Stage 1 of the Canada Inland Spousal Sponsorship program were 6 months, plus 8 months for the second stage. In 2014, times for the first stage doubled to 12 moths. In 2015 they almost tripled to 17 months, and times for the second stage also increased to 10 months, for a total of 27 months of wait.



During that time, the family goes through financial hardships, since the sponsored person:  Is not allowed to work. Can't access health care. Can't study.
Can't travel abroad.  Thousands of families have to survive on a single income, and many are on the verge of bankruptcy. This documentary follows their struggles as they try to start a family in Canada, and tries to answer the question that the Government has dodged for years: why does this backlog take place to begin with?


   What We Need & What You Get These families can't keep waiting, and neither do their stories. To be able to shoot in May, we need to gather enough funding to cover 10 days of shooting and post production:





  We need to pay for the honorariums for the cameramen, the sound recording, equipment rental and post production facilities.  If you fund us you will have access to awesome perks like access to early screenings and owning the documentary when it's released on Vimeo On Demand.

If we don't reach our goal we will do some adjustments (like using one camera instead of two) and minimize the costs even more than we are doing now.

If we surpass our goal, we will use this income to help the affected families' fund, which is currently raised by themselves and used to finance demonstrations and other resources to inform Canadians of their current situation and what they can do to help. 



   Why this documentary is important We need to raise awareness of this issue because it's not getting the attention it deserves. Even with the hard facts presented above, the Government still refuses to acknowledge that there is something wrong, with Minister Chris Alexander even declaring to the House of Commons that he has reduced the waiting time for all categories.
We need the general public to know that these half-Canadian families are facing enormous struggles because of senseless bureaucracy. We need these families to know that all of their struggle and frustration will be heard, and their stories will be told. 



I, myself, am facing the consequences of this problem, since my common law partner has not been able to work for years. We also had to cancel our wedding, scheduled for 2013, because Foreign Service diplomats decided to strike and our families were not able to come to Canada in time. We were hurt both morally and financially.
Almost two years have passed and our situation does not seem to improve due to the increasing backlog. After joining a Facebook group and listening to the stories of those affected, I realized that we're not alone. Thousands of other families are going through similar hardship, and much worse.
Instead of falling into depression, I decided to put my film-making background to good use and share these stories. My first short film ended up in the Cannes Film Festival and gained some notoriety, I hope this one too makes some noise so these stories are heard and this cause supported.

<p><i>Mafia Dad </i>is a dark comedy that parodies and pays homage to the gangster movie genre. This short film follows a group of kids who stage an intervention for their friend, Michael, because they think his Dad is in the Mafia. To back up their claims, they tell their own visceral stories which parody scenes from famous Mafia movies in different, hilarious, modern settings.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>WHY ARE WE MAKING THIS MOVIE?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Is there anybody out there who doesn’t appreciate a good gangster-mafia movie? If there is, give us their address and we’ll pay them a little visit. In all seriousness, we’re making this short film because it’s a fun, modern twist on a classically troubling and sticky family dynamic. From a directorial perspective, this concept is a creative playground. We’ve been watching classic films such as <i>The Godfather </i>franchise, <i>Goodfellas, The Sopranos, The Untouchables</i> and <i>Scarface</i> to better prepare for <i>Mafia Dad</i>’s characters, settings and situations. Underneath the hilarious situations and parodies, mass confusion and rush of adrenaline, we hope that people will ultimately walk from this story with a smile on their faces. This film represents us, as artists, and the kind of comedic work we want to create going forward in our careers. <i>Mafia Dad</i> will also be submitted to a variety of film festivals to showcase its hilarious take on the classic theme of Perception vs Reality.<br/><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>WHAT WE NEED:</h3>

<li><p><b>Equipment</b>: We need top-of-the-line camera, lighting and sound equipment so this film can look its best!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Locations</b>: We have the perfect places to shoot this movie, but we have to pay the owners for our production team to take over their space!</p></li>
<li><p><b>Special Effects Hair &amp; Makeup</b>: Our lead actor (Chet Gole) will be playing Mafia Dad… as well as his son Michael. We need extensive hair &amp; makeup to make that believable. </p></li>

Mafia Dad is a dark comedy that parodies and pays homage to the gangster movie genre. This short film follows a group of kids who stage an intervention for their friend, Michael, because they think his Dad is in the Mafia. To back up their claims, they tell their own visceral stories which parody scenes from famous Mafia movies in different, hilarious, modern settings.
   WHY ARE WE MAKING THIS MOVIE? 
Is there anybody out there who doesn’t appreciate a good gangster-mafia movie? If there is, give us their address and we’ll pay them a little visit. In all seriousness, we’re making this short film because it’s a fun, modern twist on a classically troubling and sticky family dynamic. From a directorial perspective, this concept is a creative playground. We’ve been watching classic films such as The Godfather franchise, Goodfellas, The Sopranos, The Untouchables and Scarface to better prepare for Mafia Dad’s characters, settings and situations. Underneath the hilarious situations and parodies, mass confusion and rush of adrenaline, we hope that people will ultimately walk from this story with a smile on their faces. This film represents us, as artists, and the kind of comedic work we want to create going forward in our careers. Mafia Dad will also be submitted to a variety of film festivals to showcase its hilarious take on the classic theme of Perception vs Reality.   WHAT WE NEED:
Unfortunately we do not have REAL Mafia Dads to fund this through a family “businesses,” so the majority of our fantastic cast and crew members are working for free. We need $4,000 to cover production and post-production costs. This money will go towards:

Equipment: We need top-of-the-line camera, lighting and sound equipment so this film can look its best!
Locations: We have the perfect places to shoot this movie, but we have to pay the owners for our production team to take over their space!
Special Effects Hair & Makeup: Our lead actor (Chet Gole) will be playing Mafia Dad… as well as his son Michael. We need extensive hair & makeup to make that believable. 
Production Design: We need authentic props and set design to bring this to life!
Transportation: We need to get our cast, crew and equipment from location to location!
Craft Services: We need meals for our cast and crew to get them through production!
Post Production: We need to secure editing labs, color correction and music rights, oh my!
Festival Submissions: We need to cover the cost of festival submissions... those things are expensive!

WHO WE ARE:

We are a team of young, passionate storytellers who can’t wait to tell this tale:

<p>Each new vehicle will cost about US$65,000, so we aim to launch
our fundraising campaign starting at US$33,000 and hope to build up more
momentum through Chivas The Venture campaign.</p>
<p>If the amount of funds raised is not enough to buy new vehicles,
we will redirect any amount raised to support the increasingly expensive
maintenance for the current fleet of cabs.</p>

</div></div>","Diamond Cab: Making Transportation Accessible for Aging Hong Kong
Diamond
Cab (Hong Kong) Limited was founded in Feb 2010 with the vision and mission of
providing legal, safe and convenient point-to-point transportation for the
wheelchair-bound passengers in Hong Kong, so as to meet the huge need of an
aging population. Since Diamond Cab launched its services in Feb 2011, the six
Diamond Cabs have finished over 84,710 single trips tailor-made for the
wheelchair users. We have 17 caring drivers with outstanding driving skills who
are passionate about Diamond Cab and deliver the professional
wheelchair-accessible transportation to our passengers with 24-hours
pre-booking available.



Diamond Cab drivers knee down to serve the needy in wheelchairs every day in Hong Kong. 

When your waist cannot support because of old age, our driver is ready to serve you by bending his waist too!






Diamond
Cabs usually have higher occupancy rates in day time except on holidays, as
wheelchair-bound elders need our cabs to travel for their frequent and regular
medical treatments. However, Diamond Cab is not just a non-emergency ambulance.
With our vision and mission to cultivate Happy Aging in Hong Kong, we also
organize weekly events during the evenings and help the elderly enjoy
barrier-free activities like karaoke parties or night sightseeing tours with
spectacular views.

We
have Diamond Leisure 2.0 events every week to provide unprecedented sightseeing
tour experiences to the wheelchair-bound elders. The one above was taken at
SKY100 in the highest building in Hong Kong and the one below was taken at the
Observation Wheel just launched last year and at the Japanese Hot Pot (Shabu Shabu) restaurant.








We Need Your Financial Support to Replace Old Cabs


After running for more than four years, Diamond Cabs have
traveled over an average of 320,000 km each and urgently need more capital for
better maintenance or replacement and expansion in next five years.
Your support will definitely help Diamond Cab to keep leading
the world to provide professional barrier-free taxi services for aging
societies.

Funding breakdown:

Diamond Cab uses Toyota’s Noah Welcab model. We hope to change
our existing fleet one by one in the coming years. 
Each new vehicle will cost about US$65,000, so we aim to launch
our fundraising campaign starting at US$33,000 and hope to build up more
momentum through Chivas The Venture campaign.
If the amount of funds raised is not enough to buy new vehicles,
we will redirect any amount raised to support the increasingly expensive
maintenance for the current fleet of cabs.

<b><i>THE BACK STORY</i></b>
</div>
<p>In the late 1960s and early 70s, I was a young, transplanted  Canadian kid growing up in Northern California.  Naturally, my dad would take my brothers and I to see the new, local NHL hockey team - the California Seals. (later renamed the ""Oakland Seals"" and then: ""California Golden Seals."")   </p>
<p>Through nine seasons, we watched as our team suffered through poor ownership, disasterous trades, crazy uniforms, and of course - their infamous Polar Bear White ice skates.   And every time the struggling Seals seemed ready to start firing on all cylinders, another calamity would strike.  As one writer stated: ""Everything that could go wrong, did.""    </p>
<p>I always felt that the Seals would make for a fascinating documentary.   And since I grew up to become a television producer,  I was in a great position to do something about it.  My credits include shows for E! Entertainment Television (25 episodes of ""True Hollywood Story"") as well as documentaries for the TV Guide Network, NBC, and the Reelz Channel.</p>

</h3>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The challenge of taking on a feature film is huge, costly and time consuming. On the other
hand,  a short film can be made on comparatively small budgets and in only a few
months. I think the key to making the feature film more manageable is in finding a way to
combine the simple practicalities of the short film, within the longer form of the feature film.
If we create a multi-narrative film and segment each strand of the story, assigning
different teams to different sections, maybe we could make a feature film using the same parameters of a short film?!</p>
<p></p>
<p>                              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1328063/files/20150326071516-Promo-12.jpg?1427379316"" src="""" style=""width: 387px; height: 387px;""/></p>
<p>I'm Alan Livesey, an independent Director based in Preston, Lancashire. I studied Film Production and Screenwriting at the University of Central Lancashire. Since then I have produced a series of commissioned short films and filmed a short drama on location in Los Angeles CA. I co-produce music videos and have written a feature film on commission, a script that was shortlisted at the Beverley Hills Screenplay Contest.</p>
<p>After achieving this much, I've been keen to make the step up to making a feature film. The <a href=""www.blackoutfilmproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""www.blackoutfilmproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.blackoutfilmproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blackout Film Project </a> is my approach to this challenge. By building several production crews, all responsible for a short story within The Blackout, we share the workload and produce our feature film in a fraction of the time of an ordinary independent feature film.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Blackout</h3>
<div>The Blackout is a multi-narrative feature film set in Preston, Lancashire.</div>
<div>When an all-power blackout hits the nation, the people of Preston are left isolated with no lights, no phones and no transport. The Blackout follows six characters and their journeys across the city on the first night of complete darkness.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>The Production</h3>
<div>So where are we up to so far? We have six producers currently building their crews. We have a database of crew members ready to get involved. We have a completed script, with all of our stories weaving in and out of each other. We have actors ready to find out more about our stories and audition for our characters. We have access to Cinema standard equipment.</div>
<div>And between the whole team, we have huge amounts of skills, flair and experience, spanning the whole range of the filmmaking process. We know how to make a small budget go along way.</div>
<div>We are looking to raise £8,000 to supplement our production. Each of our Production Teams gets a 6th of this money (around £1,300). So £8,000 might seem like a tiny amount for a feature, but with preproduction complete and the resources we already have, £1,300 seems like a realistic amount for a short film.</div>
<div>And that is the beauty of this approach to filmmaking.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>The Change to Filmmaking</h3>

</div></div>","A New Approach to Filmmaking...







The challenge of taking on a feature film is huge, costly and time consuming. On the other
hand,  a short film can be made on comparatively small budgets and in only a few
months. I think the key to making the feature film more manageable is in finding a way to
combine the simple practicalities of the short film, within the longer form of the feature film.
If we create a multi-narrative film and segment each strand of the story, assigning
different teams to different sections, maybe we could make a feature film using the same parameters of a short film?!

                              
I'm Alan Livesey, an independent Director based in Preston, Lancashire. I studied Film Production and Screenwriting at the University of Central Lancashire. Since then I have produced a series of commissioned short films and filmed a short drama on location in Los Angeles CA. I co-produce music videos and have written a feature film on commission, a script that was shortlisted at the Beverley Hills Screenplay Contest.
After achieving this much, I've been keen to make the step up to making a feature film. The Blackout Film Project  is my approach to this challenge. By building several production crews, all responsible for a short story within The Blackout, we share the workload and produce our feature film in a fraction of the time of an ordinary independent feature film.

The Blackout
The Blackout is a multi-narrative feature film set in Preston, Lancashire.
When an all-power blackout hits the nation, the people of Preston are left isolated with no lights, no phones and no transport. The Blackout follows six characters and their journeys across the city on the first night of complete darkness.

The Production
So where are we up to so far? We have six producers currently building their crews. We have a database of crew members ready to get involved. We have a completed script, with all of our stories weaving in and out of each other. We have actors ready to find out more about our stories and audition for our characters. We have access to Cinema standard equipment.
And between the whole team, we have huge amounts of skills, flair and experience, spanning the whole range of the filmmaking process. We know how to make a small budget go along way.
We are looking to raise £8,000 to supplement our production. Each of our Production Teams gets a 6th of this money (around £1,300). So £8,000 might seem like a tiny amount for a feature, but with preproduction complete and the resources we already have, £1,300 seems like a realistic amount for a short film.
And that is the beauty of this approach to filmmaking.

The Change to Filmmaking
We know what we're doing is a new way of making a feature. Sure, there are anthology films made in the same way, but they don't feel like a complete film. Sure, there are multi-narratives, but they're still a single director's vision (and take just as long as any other feature film).

And there are obstacles. Our goal is to make a cohesive multi-narrative. That means the scripts have to flow well, the cinematography has to feel uniform, and the final cut needs to feel like one story.
But The Blackout Film Project is also about collaboration. Our stories have been written by a team of six independent, award-winning writers who have given their creative input at every stage of the re-writing process. Their progress has also been monitored and edited at every stage by our main script editor. The same process will be replicated through production, ensuring we have a cohesive single film at the end of this project.

                               


Your Contribution
Now we know how important your money is to you. And we all know it doesn't cost me £45 to send you a digital copy of our script(!). And we know that the contribution you make to this film is what makes it come alive. So we want your contributions to be up to you. We'd rather have 3,000 contributors put some small change into our project, than try and convince 300 that they need a ""social media shout-out"" for £25 (we offer that as standard!).

We're offering as much as we can for the smallest contribution.  We're happy to offer a Business Sponsorship package for Businesses that want to support our film too. And you can support our project by following us online, signing up to our newsletter and spreading the word.
We've got all the 'nuts and bolts' in place, we just need some loose change in the meter to get us up and running.

<div>None of us live under a rock - it's become increasingly clear that the Fitness Culture of 2015 has been taken a few notches up from the 1980's dance-fitness craze of sweatbands, leg warmers, and Olivia Newton-John. Today, ""Working Out"" means striving to become the BEST, most physically fit version of yourself; and your mind will follow. In other words, the better you <b>look</b> in the mirror, the happier, more confident you will <b>feel</b>. The correlation is direct. However, anyone that's heard or read a Buzzfeed article about Meghan Trainor's ""All About that Bass"" knows that there are two sides of every coin. Whether it's not caring enough about your body image to work to improve it, or caring TOO much to the point of superficiality, you just can't win the game of ""I look and feel <b>good enough</b>."" The media (virtually every branch), gym trainers, fitness instructors, and your great-aunt who said you""maybe shouldn't have two brownies for dessert this time"" have monopolized on the <b>power</b> to send out these mixed signals, and in 2015, we gradually allow them to have this authority. </div>
<div>But this unconscious compliance can get to, and IS getting to our heads. Beauty standards are becoming warped and un-warped and warped again as we allow others to rate our physical and mental strength on a scale from 1 to SoulCycle. It's SO necessary that we talk about both sides of this issue: we don't want to become obedient slaves to today's fitness culture, but we do want to look damn good for bikini season! <b><i>The WorkOut Video!</i></b> complicates this conversation that we must start having. We're getting inside the minds of fitness instructors who are both giving and receiving these mixed messages, and in doing so, exploring and making discoveries about the psychology behind 2015's fitness culture. This film must come to life in order for us to make a well-versed statement about body image and compliance that EVERYONE has struggled with and/or questioned at some point. Chris and Kayla have been working on <b><i>The WorkOut!</i></b> for almost a year now, researching and discussing and workshopping and exploiting their own physical and mental vulnerabilities so they can bring this short film to you - the people who need to see it and turn it into part of the necessary dialogue to find a way for us all, in 2015, to <i>just be good enough.</i><b> Your help in funding this project will make that possible. </b>

</div></div>","About The WorkOut Video!
The WorkOut Video!  is an experimental film that, under the guise of a workout video, explores the complexities of today's fitness culture through the eyes of two eager, successful fitness instructors. First conceived in August 2014 by Chris Andrae and Kayla Eisenberg, The WorkOut initially was given breadth as an interactive live theatrical experience. The show culminated in a full workshopped production in October 2014, as Chris and Kayla's senior project at NYU Tisch School of the Arts,  produced by Playwrights Horizons Theater School. Since graduating, Chris and Kayla have been hard at work planning what they felt was The WorkOut's necessary next step - a short film adaptation. The WorkOut Video! is this film. Chris and Kayla have already begun editing the film's screenplay, storyboarding, and assembling an exceptional team of filmmaking collaborators to help bring this film to life. The last piece to completing this beautiful puzzle is YOU! 

   
What We Need & What You Get
 We need your help to fund the making of The WorkOut Video! This campaign was launched to raise money for all production intents and purposes. Here's what your donations will be used for:







Location/Space: Three days of filming on location in a workout studio/gym - $200


Music: We've had Swedish DJ OLWIK mix our very own The WorkOut! theme song - $250


Film Equipment: This includes camera/lighting/sound/insurance materials - $1900

Transportation: Moving van to transport film equipment to and from set - $250

ICE/Contingency Money: $300

Total Budget: $3250

Your monetary donation, regardless of how large or small, is so greatly appreciated and will go a long way. Feel free to check out the ""Perks"" we've come up with to show you just how much your help means to us. A perk you can't put a price on, however, is knowing you've contributed to the making of important, experimental, relevant art, and being able to see how that contribution comes to fruition. 




The WorkOut Video!'s Impact on Us and You

None of us live under a rock - it's become increasingly clear that the Fitness Culture of 2015 has been taken a few notches up from the 1980's dance-fitness craze of sweatbands, leg warmers, and Olivia Newton-John. Today, ""Working Out"" means striving to become the BEST, most physically fit version of yourself; and your mind will follow. In other words, the better you look in the mirror, the happier, more confident you will feel. The correlation is direct. However, anyone that's heard or read a Buzzfeed article about Meghan Trainor's ""All About that Bass"" knows that there are two sides of every coin. Whether it's not caring enough about your body image to work to improve it, or caring TOO much to the point of superficiality, you just can't win the game of ""I look and feel good enough."" The media (virtually every branch), gym trainers, fitness instructors, and your great-aunt who said you""maybe shouldn't have two brownies for dessert this time"" have monopolized on the power to send out these mixed signals, and in 2015, we gradually allow them to have this authority. 
But this unconscious compliance can get to, and IS getting to our heads. Beauty standards are becoming warped and un-warped and warped again as we allow others to rate our physical and mental strength on a scale from 1 to SoulCycle. It's SO necessary that we talk about both sides of this issue: we don't want to become obedient slaves to today's fitness culture, but we do want to look damn good for bikini season! The WorkOut Video! complicates this conversation that we must start having. We're getting inside the minds of fitness instructors who are both giving and receiving these mixed messages, and in doing so, exploring and making discoveries about the psychology behind 2015's fitness culture. This film must come to life in order for us to make a well-versed statement about body image and compliance that EVERYONE has struggled with and/or questioned at some point. Chris and Kayla have been working on The WorkOut! for almost a year now, researching and discussing and workshopping and exploiting their own physical and mental vulnerabilities so they can bring this short film to you - the people who need to see it and turn it into part of the necessary dialogue to find a way for us all, in 2015, to just be good enough. Your help in funding this project will make that possible.

(That's up to you!) Different aspects of his story will unfold on different platforms — follow one wild drunken night through manic tweets and increasingly blurry Instagram photos. Some of Rex's antics may <i>only</i> be found on Vine... or get Snapchatted to a select few of his favorite fans... or unfold streaming live on Periscope. <b>REXED </b>is a satire<i> of </i>social media, unfolding<i> on </i>social media.<br/><br/>Rex may be a star in his own mind, but the co-stars of <b>REXED </b>are his subscribers and followers — AKA, <b>YOU</b> — because <i>your </i>reactions to his words, pictures, and videos will be the true catalyst that shapes Rex's story, capturing Rex's reactions from fans (and, of course, trolls and haters) in real-time. <br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F123656033&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F123656033&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F513079865_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><b>Scripted, but unpredictable.</b> Along the way, you'll see Rex behind the scenes in his quest to be ""liked,"" shared, and followed — not just the face he presents through social media and desperate grabs at stardom, but also in our scripted series that pulls back the curtain on what Rex is <i>really</i> like when he thinks no one's watching. (Sneak preview: he's a mess.) <br/><br/>The series includes fans' actual engagements with Rex — comments on YouTube videos, tweets to Rex, the number of likes and followers on Instagram — showing how social media affects his daily life, actions, and state of mind.

</h3>Rex grew up in Beverly Hills, retiring from a lucrative child modeling career to focus on his studies (kindergarten). More recently, he starred on the <b><i>Real Housewives</i></b>-esque <b><i>Actual Apartment Renters of Los Angeles </i></b>— until he was voted off in the first episode for being ""too drunk too function.""<b><br/><br/><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vq-bXOrRVGM&amp;list=UU58cDcKHFCHNgkrsVQ2-xxg&amp;index=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Watch Rex's audition for <i>Actual Apartment Renters of LA</i></a></b><br/><br/>Next, Rex turned his attention to his aspirations to be a rap star alongside his on-again, off-again girlfriend Lana — an ""anti-socialite"" who used to be famous for being famous and now spends her days drinking heavily and hiding from paparazzi in her bathroom. Together, Rex and Lana turned it up in “<b>B.O.M.D.</b>,” which you can feast your eyes on below (if you dare).<br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fx90B1r9tmJw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dx90B1r9tmJw&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fx90B1r9tmJw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p>Now, Rex has turned his attentions to social media in hopes of stardom.

<h3><span>Rex's Entourage </span></h3>
<p><b><i>X. Alexander</i> </b>–
Writer/Director/Producer</p>
<p>X. Alexander majored in film at USC and has written for numerous
pop culture websites, in addition to working on a very eclectic mix of
screenplays for a very eclectic mix of people. During his decade in Los
Angeles, he has come into contact with a wide array of power-mad maniacs and
desperate narcissists who in no way informed his creation of these characters,
and will certainly not be parodied in future episodes. He is the writer,
producer, and director of THE AUTEUR (a short film starring Rex that inspired the spin-off series REXED).</p>
<p><b><i>Andrea Adams</i></b> – Producer</p>
<p>Andrea most recently produced the IFC Midnight/Sundance Selects
documentary MY AMITYVILLE HORROR and has worked on films including CHRONICLE,
ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THE ROMANTICS. She produced THE AUTEUR as well as many
other short films and music videos. REXED will be her first foray into the
wild realm of original series. </p>
<p><b><i>Eric Kalisher</i> </b>– Producer</p>
<p>Eric works in the media industry, guiding the
evolution of old forms (print magazines) and the rise of news ones 
(YouTube channels).
After several years away from the camera, he returned to the world of 
film production in 2014 with THE AUTEUR. When he's not trying to make 
Rex famous, he's working on several writing projects and preparing a 
move to the director's chair.<b><a href=""http://crowdfundingcast.tk/crowdfunding-cast-episode-130-rexed/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><br/></a></b></p>

<p>Rex isn’t so responsible with money. But we are! Our team already produced THE AUTEUR, a short film starring Rex to be released later this spring. No matter how much we raise for REXED through your generosity, one hundred percent goes toward the costs of production and post-production of our original series — cast and crew, locations, equipment, and so on.

</div></div>","A Fully Interactive Comedy SeriesIn the digital age, we all have more than one persona — who we are in our daily lives, and the face we present to the world through social media. REXED is a comedy that shows us both sides of the young and the clueless, chronicling the misadventures of an over-confident, talent-free wannabe in his quest to be a star. Rex is Certified ""FUNNY"" on FUNNY or DIE — watch here!What sets REXED apart? Fans can follow Rex through Instagram, Twitter, Vine, etc., as well as his YouTube vlog. Tweet at Rex? He'll tweet back. Comment on his latest video? You might catch him mentioning you in his next vlog post.Lots of series have a social media component, but REXED is the first that is about social media celebrity, capturing the rise of the next major media influencer... orrrr his spectacular failure. (That's up to you!) Different aspects of his story will unfold on different platforms — follow one wild drunken night through manic tweets and increasingly blurry Instagram photos. Some of Rex's antics may only be found on Vine... or get Snapchatted to a select few of his favorite fans... or unfold streaming live on Periscope. REXED is a satire of social media, unfolding on social media.Rex may be a star in his own mind, but the co-stars of REXED are his subscribers and followers — AKA, YOU — because your reactions to his words, pictures, and videos will be the true catalyst that shapes Rex's story, capturing Rex's reactions from fans (and, of course, trolls and haters) in real-time. Scripted, but unpredictable. Along the way, you'll see Rex behind the scenes in his quest to be ""liked,"" shared, and followed — not just the face he presents through social media and desperate grabs at stardom, but also in our scripted series that pulls back the curtain on what Rex is really like when he thinks no one's watching. (Sneak preview: he's a mess.) The series includes fans' actual engagements with Rex — comments on YouTube videos, tweets to Rex, the number of likes and followers on Instagram — showing how social media affects his daily life, actions, and state of mind. What Rex does next is determined by whether he has 10 followers or 10 million, giving the audience an unparallelled amount of influence and interactivity with our star. Stepping into Rex’s universe will be an immersive experience that 
allows you to interact with our star anywhere you spend your time 
online. In fact, it's already started.Here’s where you can start interacting with Rex right now:Rex on Twitter @RexYouUpRex on Instagram @RexYouUpRex on Vine @RexYouUpRex's YouTubeSo watch out. Rex is coming at you… whether you like it or not.Who The Hell Is Rex? 
Rex grew up in Beverly Hills, retiring from a lucrative child modeling career to focus on his studies (kindergarten). More recently, he starred on the Real Housewives-esque Actual Apartment Renters of Los Angeles — until he was voted off in the first episode for being ""too drunk too function.""Watch Rex's audition for Actual Apartment Renters of LANext, Rex turned his attention to his aspirations to be a rap star alongside his on-again, off-again girlfriend Lana — an ""anti-socialite"" who used to be famous for being famous and now spends her days drinking heavily and hiding from paparazzi in her bathroom. Together, Rex and Lana turned it up in “B.O.M.D.,” which you can feast your eyes on below (if you dare).Now, Rex has turned his attentions to social media in hopes of stardom. He's trying anything and everything to get noticed on the internet — cooking videos (with Chee-tohs!), kidnapping puppies ('cause the internet loves dogs), sharing his not-so-deep ""insights"" with the world, and so much more. Get ""B.O.M.D."" on iTunes!REXED the series follows our hapless “hero” on his mission to get the world to take notice of his many talents — and, more importantly, his 
gorgeous face. That's where you come in...





Why We Need Your Help 

Rex’s social media exploits thus far have been fun, but the 
real fun begins in the scripted series, which can only be made with your contributions.
We need your money! Seriously, folks, in order for us to fully produce a high-quality first season, we need a cool $22,000. 
Refer to the graph below for a reference as to where exactly that money will go...

Rex's Entourage 
X. Alexander –
Writer/Director/Producer
X. Alexander majored in film at USC and has written for numerous
pop culture websites, in addition to working on a very eclectic mix of
screenplays for a very eclectic mix of people. During his decade in Los
Angeles, he has come into contact with a wide array of power-mad maniacs and
desperate narcissists who in no way informed his creation of these characters,
and will certainly not be parodied in future episodes. He is the writer,
producer, and director of THE AUTEUR (a short film starring Rex that inspired the spin-off series REXED).
Andrea Adams – Producer
Andrea most recently produced the IFC Midnight/Sundance Selects
documentary MY AMITYVILLE HORROR and has worked on films including CHRONICLE,
ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THE ROMANTICS. She produced THE AUTEUR as well as many
other short films and music videos. REXED will be her first foray into the
wild realm of original series. 
Eric Kalisher – Producer
Eric works in the media industry, guiding the
evolution of old forms (print magazines) and the rise of news ones 
(YouTube channels).
After several years away from the camera, he returned to the world of 
film production in 2014 with THE AUTEUR. When he's not trying to make 
Rex famous, he's working on several writing projects and preparing a 
move to the director's chair.

Our Intent

Rex isn’t so responsible with money. But we are! Our team already produced THE AUTEUR, a short film starring Rex to be released later this spring. No matter how much we raise for REXED through your generosity, one hundred percent goes toward the costs of production and post-production of our original series — cast and crew, locations, equipment, and so on. (No helicopter. No hookers.) 
The more we raise, the more you’ll see and hear from Rex — and the more awesome it can be! We want to make this a fun ride for all (not just for Rex).

<h3>THE JOURNEY SO FAR</h3>
<p>The idea of playing in the world of contract killers first assailed Jennah while in film school many (many) years ago. After gathering friends together to play with katanas and shoot a short film, the  idea refused to die and continued to develop into a more fully fleshed out story, finally evolving into a TV series concept.

Eva overpowers Andy, but stops short of killing her. Instead, Eva defends her innocence and tells Andy that there was an attempt on her life as well.

<p><b>WE ARE READY TO COMPLETE THE FILM</b></p>
<p>We have filmed for over
two decades and there is only so much we can do on our own. This film has an
immense potential to be seen around the world.
With professional help in editing, sound, music, marketing and
distribution, this dynamic team will bring the film to completion. </p>
<p><b>MUSIC</b>                                                                                                                                               Music is a big part of
this film, with a score composed by local and international musicians, using a mix of traditional and modern instruments, including live location recordings. Sound engineering will be done in a studio with a musical director to produce the original sound track for the film.
</p><p><b>EDITING</b>                                                                                                                                        Editing is an enormous
job, with footage gathered over a long period and hundreds of hours of tape,
shot on different cameras. Over the years we filmed in different formats. Editing will
include transfering this material to digital format.<br/></p><p><b>DISTRIBUTION</b>                                                                                                                                We wish for as many
people as possible to see this film. We are looking to cover the costs to
 apply for international film festivals and alternative cinemas, as well
as marketing, advertising and distribution of this documentary world
wide. Travel expenses will include introduction of the film as guest
speakers at screenings and further promotion. </p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> POST- PRODUCTION OF FILM</b>                                                                                            Script, Sound Effects,

raising a family, living on the land and searching for
God. It is told through the eyes of Shraddha, who has been filming her unique journey
and family over the last 20 years. The film explores life's universal questions
and how we can all make a positive difference in our daily lives. Shraddha, with her husband Gito and their three children built a life and
a sanctuary deep in the rainforest. They drink pure mountain water, grow organic vegetables and live in a hand-built house which runs on solar power.The film takes the viewer on an extraordinary journey of a family's quest seeking the meaning of life.Who am I?   Who is God? How can we find world peace?    How can we live in harmony with nature?Their quest for meaning took the family around the globe to
meet spiritual leaders:  H.H. The Dalai Lama, Osho, Papaji- India, Dorothy Maclean - Findhorn Scotland,         Jose Arguelles -Mayan, Chief Arvol Looking Horse - Lakota and other visionaries.                                      The Forest Family, in the early days of making this film

In her early 30's, having worked successfully
as an actress, Shraddha moved from the city to the country to find
an alternative lifestyle. She documented her personal development and
growth, as she home birthed her children and created a family life in the lush
sub-tropical rainforest on the rim of the Wollumbin Caldera.



            
                        The house in the forest, hand built from rocks and timberTHE  SPIRITUAL QUESTThis is a story of courage,
a search for truth, a journey of trust and a quest for answers. Will they discover what they are looking for, overcome obstacles, meet the people they want to interview and find the
answers? The theme of spiritual and personal quest carries us through this story, as we are given valuable insights on this unique
journey.           Meeting H.H. The Dalai Lama at a press conference during his
Australia                            Tour 2002 ""Happiness in a material world"" THE STYLE
This personal narrative takes the audience on an intimate journey on
life, love and God combining unique footage and colourful visuals with an original music score. It introduces us to some of the world's most active peacekeepers and sacred places of power. Along with spectacular
footage of their land and culture, the forest family meets and interviews indigenous
elders and spiritual masters. They speak about the urgency for peace on earth
and the need to care for our environment.                                                               The Gyoto Monks of Tibet, Australia 1994 THE VISION
Shraddha's vision to make this film began with a performance of the Gyoto
Monks of Tibet. As the monks sung their ancient tonal sounds, she experienced a deep meditation that guided her to make a film about the art of being.                                                 Shraddha in the forest under the stars
The film opens in the
Australian rainforest, where Shraddha can be seen in a fire heated bath. As she
gazes up through the trees to the stars, she contemplates the questions which
will send her and her family on a pilgrimage to the four corners of the planet.       
                   Our community walks for peace at the start of the Iraq War 2003INSPIRATION TO  MAKE
THIS FILM
We feel that there is
more to life than war, consumerism and greed. Happiness comes by living a simple life, connected to
family, nature and Spirit.
This inspired us to
document and reveal to others that there are choices in how we live our lives
and how we walk on this planet, interconnected to all living things.Gathering of many elders from around the world, celebrating ""The New Dawn""          at the end of the Mayan Calendar 2012, Byron Bay, AustraliaWe want to honour the different wisdom keepers on the planet, the
masters and elders that we have met along the way. We have made a commitment to
share their ancient teachings to promote peace on earth.              World Peace and Prayer Day with Chief
Arvol Looking Horse, Lakotah 2003WHY THIS FILM IS IMPORTANT 
We are making this film
because of a deep concern for our future generations. We want to see that our
children have their birth-right, to live on a planet that has clean water, fresh air and the freedom for all of us to be happy human beings.                  Celebration of life: Mahto at his naming
ceremony with Shraddha and Gito 1997This film is our story of an alternative approach to life. We hope to inspire other people
to find their own way to happiness and inner peace by living in harmony with
mother nature.
WE ARE READY TO COMPLETE THE FILM
We have filmed for over
two decades and there is only so much we can do on our own. This film has an
immense potential to be seen around the world.
With professional help in editing, sound, music, marketing and
distribution, this dynamic team will bring the film to completion. 
MUSIC                                                                                                                                               Music is a big part of
this film, with a score composed by local and international musicians, using a mix of traditional and modern instruments, including live location recordings. Sound engineering will be done in a studio with a musical director to produce the original sound track for the film.
EDITING                                                                                                                                        Editing is an enormous
job, with footage gathered over a long period and hundreds of hours of tape,
shot on different cameras. Over the years we filmed in different formats. Editing will
include transfering this material to digital format.DISTRIBUTION                                                                                                                                We wish for as many
people as possible to see this film. We are looking to cover the costs to
 apply for international film festivals and alternative cinemas, as well
as marketing, advertising and distribution of this documentary world
wide. Travel expenses will include introduction of the film as guest
speakers at screenings and further promotion.  POST- PRODUCTION OF FILM                                                                                            Script, Sound Effects,

<p><strong>A Note from the Writer: </strong></p>
<p>The story is not about suicide, it's about living life to the fullest without fear. It's almost the reverse of suicide, it's a jump to life. The man is not afraid of dying, and thus, not afraid to live. He makes her confront her fears to liberate her. She is not afraid of heights anymore after her encounter with the man. She was able to get rid of all the rationality and narcissism she had at the beginning to finally be truthful even with her own feelings, and ready to take a leap into the unknown.</p>
<h3>But, JUMP why?</h3>
<p>If we are able to meet our goal with YOUR SUPPORT we will be able to tell a story that may just provoke YOU to take a deeper look inside and see how willing you are to let go of fear. Would you JUMP? Join us in telling this story and maybe you'll have a new perspective on how to answer that question.</p>
<h3>And, JUMP where?</h3>

</div></div>","JUMP what?
A fledgling Private Investigator wants to get to the bottom of a man's mysterious association with crimes taking place in Los Angeles.  After tracking him down, the criminal turned 'Jumper' negotiates with her instead. Or is she talking to herself? 
Oh, JUMP this. 
What makes JUMP unique is that we are using artists from multiple genres of story telling from cartoonist/graphic novelist to voice over actors and filmmakers, and shooting a low budget film with high quality gear (Thanks to Drew!) in locations downtown in LA. The goal is to create high quality content with a female protagonist who's uniquely comedic -- ABSURDIST - voice challenges YOUR perspective on how to face your fears in life.
Wait, JUMP who?
Celine Nyanga: (writer) is a playwright, writer and translator originally from Paris, France. She has written poetry, short stories and screenplays both in French and in English. After graduating from film school in Paris, where she wrote and directed a short film and a documentary, she worked on several feature films as an assistant director in France. Céline settled in Los Angeles a few years ago, where she wrote and directed the award-winning play Uterine Affairs, which premiered at the Hollywood Fringe Festival in June 2016.
Monica Gozalbo: (writer) is a writer and producer based in Los Angeles. She has worked in the advertising and corporate film sector both in her native Spain and in the US, and has participated as a director, writer and producer in independent productions for film and theater (including the award-winning play Uterine Affairs, premiered at the Hollywood Fringe 2016). Mónica has published several books and articles as a translator and writer, and holds a PhD in Film Studies.
Lisa Cordileone (actor/producer), Frankie Ingrassia (director), Drew Ganyer (director of photography)  Alex Goens (sound), Glenn Stanton (man/jumper), Michael St. Michaels (angry driver), Paige Braddock (cartoonist)
A Note from the Writer: 
The story is not about suicide, it's about living life to the fullest without fear. It's almost the reverse of suicide, it's a jump to life. The man is not afraid of dying, and thus, not afraid to live. He makes her confront her fears to liberate her. She is not afraid of heights anymore after her encounter with the man. She was able to get rid of all the rationality and narcissism she had at the beginning to finally be truthful even with her own feelings, and ready to take a leap into the unknown.
But, JUMP why?
If we are able to meet our goal with YOUR SUPPORT we will be able to tell a story that may just provoke YOU to take a deeper look inside and see how willing you are to let go of fear. Would you JUMP? Join us in telling this story and maybe you'll have a new perspective on how to answer that question.
And, JUMP where?

I'm Garry Anthony Fraser, I'm a BAFTA award winning filmmaker and social entrepreneur that focuses on issues in Scottish society that most people shy away from.  I focus on deprived council schemes and the young people who live in them. I can get through to the most hard to reach in our society,  but I need your help.  Really.  

Wideo Media, a social enterprise I set up in 2012,  aims to harness creativity in youths who are otherwise marginalised in society and empower them through the art of filmmaking. 

It's really important for me to help create stepping stones for socially excluded young people throughout Scotland  I found my own path out of the margins, and now I want to leave a ladder for others to climb. 
Inner City Arts (ICA) intervention projects are a proven catalyst and real game-changer for the life's of the most vulnerable young people in society. They also benefit community safety, and increase life-chances. Edinburgh University Social Work & Political Science Dept will carry out evaluation of this project, our fourth so far. This will give us a social return of investment to help our case for future sustainability.We will work with 11 young people who are all in need of intervention & support right NOW!!!  And we need your help. 


   What We Need & What You Get

We need £15k funding to run this project. This will cover travel and subsistence  for the young people, staffing costs, camera hire, insurance, and post production marketing.   
Our minimum costs of making an intervention are £9,000, However, It will be under-resourced and will have a far weaker impact without appropriate funds. To make a real difference in the lives of young people we need £15,000  

Lots of people have banded together to provide some amazing rewards and perks; Irvine Welsh has donated signed books, or come & get dinner with some of the cast & crew. You can also visit our editor while he cuts the finished film - or get a character named after you.  If you have a company logo, it could appear on our closing credits.  
    The Impact
What do we do?  In short..
""""we get wee c***s off the schemes and into education.Nobody else does it.""


This is an opportunity to intervene at a critical time in a young persons life and improve their chances. We have run 3 projects before with next to no funding & helped over 25 young people into employment, education,training. Imagine what we could do with your help. 


By contributing to the campaign you are literally helping to save lives through offering an alternative to the life that some of these folk seemed destined to.      
This project is valuable because the issues raised effect all of us as a society. It's not a government led initiative,      
Once this project is completed, we will stick with the young people through their next steps to create a peer to peer support network for college education and/ or jobs.

Risks & Challenges

monasteries of the Khashuri and Kareli
districts in the Urbnisi Eparchy. This region has the largest
concentrated number of monasteries in Georgia whose original 
construction dates back to the 11<sup>th</sup> century. 
The film travels to a cliff monastery perched 1700 meters on the side of
mountain; through beautiful mountain landscapes and to the small cave which
holds the bones of monks murdered in the 14th century.  We feel privileged the project has been given
a blessing and access to previously unseen (undocumented) special holy sites

<p>The Importance of Our Work:</p>
<p>Every little girl in America has been taught through fairytales, books, film, television and media in general that she deserves her prince--her knight in shining armor.   All little girls except transgendered girls.  Fairytales are an inherit part of our culture.  They play an even more important role in the imaginations and creativity of marginalized communities.  Characters portrayed in media, film, books, etc. allow marginalized individuals to fantasize and see themselves represented, sometimes for the first time.  Without continued representation in the media, there could be isolation and other negative consequences.</p>
<p>Since coming out at the age of 16, I have felt a deep kinship with trans-women and their severe lack of representation in the media.   The cost that is having on their lives is immeasurable and unconscionable.  Considering, that among the LGBT community, trans men and women are at the most risk for violent crime and suicide, it's easy for me to empathize, but it's also easy for me to see the impact in real and measured ways too.  So, as a filmmaker the urgency of telling stories that featured empowering transgendered characters and stories, like those in <i>The 89th Key, </i>are of paramount importance to me.  I hope you share my vision and my passion!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order for us to make this film we need a lot of dough.  It's an ambitious project and this is the breakdown of what we need and what incentives we have to offer you for your generous contribution:</p>

<p><i>The 89th Key</i> is a fairytale for transgendered people, specifically transgendered girls and women.  The film features a principal transgendered character who is not a victim, who is in control of her own life, who has her own sexuality yet is not exploited, who is not a stereotype, and doesn't focus on the American media's obsession with genitalia or surgery or any of the other salacious aspects of transition and is the object of love and not just sex.   This film is a musical-comedy fairytale love story for and about transgendered people but also it's designed to help start a dialogue with all people.  Beyond that it's also a fun musical-comedy!</p>
<p>As a contributor to the film you not only will be helping some deserving college students make a film, you'll also allow the film to be seen by many people, making it's way into festivals across the country.  To have these impactful images of transgendered people seen by as many people as possible is a huge thing.  Won't you help us achieve that goal? </p>

'NEPS'. The Youth of Nepalese Britain.   
In 1997, all Gurkha veterans with at least four years of service were granted the right to settle in Britain. With this, came a change in the cultural landscape of towns and cities across the country. This not only affected the lives of the veterans, but also their children and grandchildren, who would find themselves settling in Britain far away from home. 
'Neps', is a colloquial term used by Nepalese youth to refer to a younger subculture within Nepali-British communities. As second or third generation Gurkha's, their lives are often dominated by the influence of the British Army, fore fronted as the ultimate ambition for a lot of Nepalese young men.  
But is this a true reflection of Nepalese youth in Britain?  
The purpose of our film is to a give voice to this generation of Nepalese youth. To explore their relationship within the communities they live in and the influence of British life on their existing cultural values. It aims to challenge Nepal's military stereotypes, breaking down preconceptions about youth subculture, masculinity and ethnic diversity.        


Hamro Pusta Films was founded by filmmakers Joel Davidson and Suraj Sahi in order to explore the realities of identity and community among Nepalese youth. We are passionate about making this film a reality, and need your help to do so.
 Where your money goes...
 The £2000 funding target will go towards travel costs to Pokhara, Nepal for Nepalese crew members (a trip that will see many return to their hometowns and extended families). It will also contribute to film festival fees, equipment hire and a trip to meet the families of the film's key members.     
All excess funding will be donated to the 'Nepal Youth Foundation'.

      What your money means...
Your money allows for Nepalese youth to be heard. 
Support for this film is vital for us to achieve our goal of exploring the issues and questions that are not presented to the western world regarding Nepalese culture.  

Perks
We are offering some very special and unique gifts and opportunities for everyone who donates to the project. These include limited edition copies of the film, extra digital and physical content as well as invitations to screenings, Nepalese cultural days and experiences, and much more!

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Film</span><br/>
</h3> <p>After losing his mother to obesity, a thirty-two year old chubby ginger comedian and vegan son-of-a-pig-farmer sets out to avoid the same fate by running one hundred miles through the mountains of Colorado in one of the world's most unforgiving ultra trail marathons...and lives to tell jokes about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part documentary and part stand-up comedy special, <i>Once Is Enough</i> is an inspiring hybrid documentary composed of two components.  The first component is a documentary film following Jeffrey, in the wake of his mother's death, losing over one hundred pounds and attempting to run one of the world's most difficult one hundred mile ultra marathons.  The second component is a stand-up comedy special about the entire experience.  The final film with be a seamless juxtaposition of both components that will have the audience in tears one minute and rolling in the aisles the next.  </li>
<li>Jeffrey James Binney is a Los Angeles based actor/comedian who has been seen on Late Night With David Letterman, in the 1st National Tour and Chicago Company of the Broadway musical The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, and at comedy clubs and festivals across the country. </li>
<li>Jeffrey's trainer, Ian Sharman, has been racing around the world in all styles of events since 2005 and coaching since 2010, having run around 200 ultras and marathons in every type of weather and on all terrains. He's won almost 50 multi-day races, road marathons, trail ultras and adventure races with experience of running in many mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, Andes, Rockies and European Alps. He also holds the fastest time in a trail 100-mile race in the US (12h44m), the record for the Grand Slam of Ultrarunning (69h49m) and is the 2013 Leadville Trail 100 Champion.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>What's more expensive than making a movie?  Making a movie that requires taking an entire film crew into some of the most remote wilderness locations to film a chubby ginger running 100 miles through the forest.  Enough of the touchy feel stuff...here's what need...</p> <ul>
<li>Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim Training Run ($11,000) - We'll be taking our film crew into the Grand Canyon to follow Jeffrey attempt the forty-five mile run down into the Grand Canyon, up the other side, and back again.</li> <li>Leadville 100 ($22,000) - We'll be taking Jeffrey's running crew and film crew to Leadville, CO for a week to film his attempt at the Leadville 100.  The logistics of getting this many people and our equipment onto these mountain trails to film someone constantly moving for thirty hours, sometimes in the dark, through some of the roughest terrain in North America are mind-boggling...not to mention expensive. </li> <li>Comedy Special Live Taping ($16,000) - We'll be taking our film crew to Kansas City to film Jeffrey's one-hour comedy special about the experience.  Although it's still costly, we're filming in Kansas City to help reduce the cost.</li>
<li>Post-Production ($30,000) - Many people don't realize that the most time-consuming and expensive part of the film making process is what happens after everything has been shot.  Editors...sound...color correction..this is the stuff that can make or break a project like this.  </li>
<li>Equipment ($9,000) - External hard drives, software, at least six pair of running shoes, headlamps,....the list is endless. </li>
<li>PR, Marketing, Advertising, Festival Fees ($19,000) - Once we have the finished product we want to make sure we have the resources to get it out there so people can see it!  Our team feels confident we can do the job with $19,000.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Leadville 100</h3>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><p></p>
<p>The race where legends are created and limits are tested.  One hundred miles of extreme Colorado Rockies terrain - from elevations of 9,200 to 12,600 feet.  100 continuous miles of unrelenting trail that must be completed in 30 hours.

</div></div>","The Film
 After losing his mother to obesity, a thirty-two year old chubby ginger comedian and vegan son-of-a-pig-farmer sets out to avoid the same fate by running one hundred miles through the mountains of Colorado in one of the world's most unforgiving ultra trail marathons...and lives to tell jokes about it.

Part documentary and part stand-up comedy special, Once Is Enough is an inspiring hybrid documentary composed of two components.  The first component is a documentary film following Jeffrey, in the wake of his mother's death, losing over one hundred pounds and attempting to run one of the world's most difficult one hundred mile ultra marathons.  The second component is a stand-up comedy special about the entire experience.  The final film with be a seamless juxtaposition of both components that will have the audience in tears one minute and rolling in the aisles the next.  
Jeffrey James Binney is a Los Angeles based actor/comedian who has been seen on Late Night With David Letterman, in the 1st National Tour and Chicago Company of the Broadway musical The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, and at comedy clubs and festivals across the country. 
Jeffrey's trainer, Ian Sharman, has been racing around the world in all styles of events since 2005 and coaching since 2010, having run around 200 ultras and marathons in every type of weather and on all terrains. He's won almost 50 multi-day races, road marathons, trail ultras and adventure races with experience of running in many mountain ranges, including the Himalayas, Andes, Rockies and European Alps. He also holds the fastest time in a trail 100-mile race in the US (12h44m), the record for the Grand Slam of Ultrarunning (69h49m) and is the 2013 Leadville Trail 100 Champion.
   What We Need What's more expensive than making a movie?  Making a movie that requires taking an entire film crew into some of the most remote wilderness locations to film a chubby ginger running 100 miles through the forest.  Enough of the touchy feel stuff...here's what need... 
Grand Canyon Rim to Rim to Rim Training Run ($11,000) - We'll be taking our film crew into the Grand Canyon to follow Jeffrey attempt the forty-five mile run down into the Grand Canyon, up the other side, and back again. Leadville 100 ($22,000) - We'll be taking Jeffrey's running crew and film crew to Leadville, CO for a week to film his attempt at the Leadville 100.  The logistics of getting this many people and our equipment onto these mountain trails to film someone constantly moving for thirty hours, sometimes in the dark, through some of the roughest terrain in North America are mind-boggling...not to mention expensive.  Comedy Special Live Taping ($16,000) - We'll be taking our film crew to Kansas City to film Jeffrey's one-hour comedy special about the experience.  Although it's still costly, we're filming in Kansas City to help reduce the cost.
Post-Production ($30,000) - Many people don't realize that the most time-consuming and expensive part of the film making process is what happens after everything has been shot.  Editors...sound...color correction..this is the stuff that can make or break a project like this.  
Equipment ($9,000) - External hard drives, software, at least six pair of running shoes, headlamps,....the list is endless. 
PR, Marketing, Advertising, Festival Fees ($19,000) - Once we have the finished product we want to make sure we have the resources to get it out there so people can see it!  Our team feels confident we can do the job with $19,000.

  The Leadville 100

The race where legends are created and limits are tested.  One hundred miles of extreme Colorado Rockies terrain - from elevations of 9,200 to 12,600 feet.  100 continuous miles of unrelenting trail that must be completed in 30 hours. The Leadville 100 is one of the world's oldest and toughest ultra marathons.
In most years fewer than half the starters complete the race.  Dehydration, muscle spasms & sodium imbalance are just a few of the ways a runner can find himself on the side of the trail unable to finish. 
Risks & Challenges The are a number of risks and challenges with taking on a project with so many physical and logistical challenges.  Our team has put together an incredible plan of action to ensure everything goes as smoothly as possible.  Here are a few of our biggest challenges... 
Finishing Successfully - Jeffrey is training with one of the world's greatest endurance athletes and so far he has been successful in all of his runs.  However, it's possible he won't finish.  No matter how prepared Jeffrey is physically and mentally there are things out of his control that could go wrong.  Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia,  broken bones, sprained ankles, hypothermia...just to name a few.  While Jeffrey's trainer and medical team will be monitoring him closely throughout the process, it's important to note that the film does not hinge on Jeffrey finishing the race.  While finishing is the goal and highly likely, we will still have an incredibly inspiring story to tell whether he is successful in his attempt for not.  Crew Safety - When watching the film of Jeffrey running 100 miles it will be easy to forget that capturing Jeffrey's run will require film crew to run with him while carrying cameras.  
Elements - We'll be filming outdoors in some of the most rugged and unpredictable conditions.  We're ready for everything from lightening to frost-bite...but we'd be lying if we said this wasn't at the forefront of our minds. 

Our GoalOur goal is to inspire millions across the globe to use the time they have on this planet to do something incredible.  Jeffrey's ""something incredible"" is taking charge of his health and pushing himself physically and mentally further than he has ever gone by running 100 miles.  But what's YOUR ""something incredible?""  This project's goal is to inspire you to find your incredible! #FindYourIncredibleEach time you use the hashtag #FindYourIncredible when posting about goals you're working toward during our IndieGoGo campaign you'll receive an entry into a drawing for a $250 REI Gift Card!

<p>Au fil de ses deux premières saisons, l’équipe de production de l’émission a remarqué qu’un certain
manque de présence sur le web se faisait sentir. Ainsi, l’équipe a développé une stratégie web qui va
permettre à l’émission de passer à un stade supérieur lors de sa diffusion. Cette stratégie vise principalement à
développer le contenu relatif aux artistes participants ainsi que d’augmenter la réactivité des membres de la
communauté en leur offrant des outils spécialisés à leur visionnement web et finalement augmenter la présence
sur le web. Voici les trois (3) points majeurs de cette stratégie web : </p>

</div></div>","Parti d’un concept d’une saison unique, «À dos de talents» est devenu un concept d’échelle provinciale au Québec qui vise à promouvoir les talents émergents et la relève artistique de chaque région. Elle est destinée à un public cible de 15 à 25 ans ainsi qu’à tous les intervenants du domaine artistique, à
l'entourage proche ou éloigné des participants ainsi qu'à tous les amateurs de musique, art ou télévision et
websérie.

Le principe de l’émission est simple. Il s’agit de présenter des jeunes artistes, de parler de leur cheminement artistique et de promouvoir leur musique ou leur art. Ces artistes seront des jeunes artistes et des amateurs dans le domaine. Chacun des épisodes de la saison sera axé sur un jeune artiste (musique, art dramatique, arts visuels et autres). Tous les artistes auront un style différent afin de démonter la diversité présente dans le domaine des arts. Ils présenteront néanmoins leurs propres compositions afin de proposer du nouveau matériel aux auditeurs, en français, car cela est un des buts de l’émission . Les participants seront interviewés par un(e) animateur(trice) afin de connaitre des informations importantes telles que leurs inspirations, leurs motivations, leurs spectacles et autres. L’animateur(trice) sera également un(e) amateur(e) et devra animer l’émission selon un scénario préétabli.



 À chaque épisode, de jeunes artistes se présentent au public. Un talent caché en eux en fait leur
renommée et ils se livrent aux caméras pour le dévoiler. Que ce soit en musique, en chant, en théâtre, chaque
talent vaut la peine d’être vu, écouté et ressenti. Les artistes seront interviewés, échangeront ensemble et
découvriront de nouveaux horizons. De plus, ils présenteront leurs propres compositions sur le plateau. «À
dos de talents» est une émission qui met en valeur les jeunes, leurs talents et laisse place à la créativité... «À dos de talents», tout simplement inspirant!







La saison 3 sera composée de 14 épisodes.Chacun des 14 épisodes aura durée d'environ 30 minutes. L'épisode de clôture de la saison 3 regroupera tous les artistes dans un même et unique épisode.




À dos de talents» est une émission faite pour des jeunes. L'émission vise à promouvoir la relève
artistique et faire connaître des talents. Ainsi, l'émission vise à atteindre les buts et intentions suivants : 



1) Promouvoir et faire découvrir des talents émergents






2) Aider à la diffusion (sensibiliser la population) 






3) Permettre le développement d’une équipe de production 






4) Ouvrir un réseau d’artistes 






5) Promouvoir l’importance de la langue française 












C’est sur ces cinq principaux points que l’émission «À dos de talents» a vu le jour. Sur deux saisons
particulièrement réussies, l’émission a réussi à prouver que ces fondements faisaient la différence et surtout, qu’il
était très payant de les intégrer au concept.  Des exemples de réussite et d’atteinte des objectifs seraient les artistes comme Simon Lacas (saison 1, Étoile montante Ford 2013) Thomas Argouin (saison 1, 2ème place de la finale nationale de Cégep en Spectacle en 2013), Émile Bilodeau (saison 2, 2e place de la finale nationale de Cégep en Spectacle en 2014), Douce Sévigny (saison 2), Alexandre Légaré (saison 1/2), Les Passagers (saison 2).

<br/><p>What you have seen here described is the essence of the WALPIE WALK.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Walpie Walk is all about freedom, joy and groovyness in your feet. It's about feeling the uplifting and eternal beat of the universe and surrendering to it. The way to achieve the Walpie Walk is to follow in Walpie's cute little pawsteps. </p><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>And who is Walpie?<br/></p>
<p>Walpie is a cat creature of the species Walkopard (Panthera walkus). Walkopards are a recently discovered feline species. So far Walpie is the only known specimen of the Walkopard species. </p>
<p>So where does Walpie live?</p>
<p>Right now we are building a brand new home for Walpie to live in; a smartphone app for Android and iOS. That means that each of you will be able to have Walpie on your smartphones very soon.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main purpose of this app is to allow you to take a walk with Walpie whenever you please. The more you walk with him, the more you will become like him. That means that your WALPINESS score will increase. Walpiness score will unlock various features inside the game, and bring you certain rewards. </p>
<p>Here you can see a screenshot of the main walking feature inside the app:</p>
float: right;<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1123068/files/20141230090126-walk_screen.jpg?1419958886"" src="""" style=""width: 334.251px; height: 594px;""/></p>
<i>Walpie app in walking mode</i><br/><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The way the walking works is using your GPS system to track your real movement. When you start walking, after a couple of steps, Walpie starts walking with you. If you think about cheating and turning the walking mode on when driving a car or a bicycle, think again! Walpie has his own thing going, his own rhythm and if you go too fast, he will drop out of your phone. Your app will be catless and empty from that moment on. But don't worry, you can return to that location later and pick him up. Just approach the right GPS location and he'll hop into your smartphone. </p>
<p>For best results, be sure to turn the music on and try to walk in it's 105 BPM rhythm. This is the beat of the Walpie Walk. <br/></p>
<p>Before going out for a walk with Walpie, be sure to check his mood. Sometimes he feels like going out, and sometimes he feels like staying in. His tail will tell. The more he feels like walking, the more Walpiness score you get after each walk. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1123042/files/20141230084508-tail_test.jpg?1419957908"" src="""" style=""width: 333.256px; height: 444px;""/></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<i>Walpie tail mood test</i><br/><br/><p>Also, be sure to check how shiny his fur is in the fur gloss test. If it's not shiny enough, you'll have go give him enough privacy (behind the curtain) to lick himself. After a good licking session, he's good to go. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1123044/files/20141230084628-licking.jpg?1419957988"" src="""" style=""width: 339px; height: 339px;""/></p>

<p><i>MITS with his favorite record player</i><br/><br/>As you can see from this poster, MITS is always seen wearing a suit, which is how he got his name Man In The Suit (or MITS). Also, very few people have had the privilege to see his face. <br/></p>
<p>So what does this guy have to do with anything?</p>
<p>Slow down, we'll get to it. <br/></p>
<p>MITS worked as a record producer in the 70's and ran a little recording studio in New York. During the great blackout of 1977 when most of the city plunged into darkness due to a power outage, something strange happened. It seems that some kind of electronic cat found its way through the empty electrical grid, and into a 24-track tape machine in the little studio of Mr. MITS. When strange organ sounds started appearing on empty tracks of the 24-track tape, MITS realized that his tape machine is ""haunted"". Figuring out that he had discovered a new type of feline life form, he decided to make a proper home for it. Next year, in 1978, he produced a vinyl record with the song Feline Dancer, as a new home for Walpie to move into. Walpie accepted the gift, and that's where he has been living for the past 36 years; inside a vinyl record. <br/></p>
<p>In the following music video, you can see Walpie in his old vinyl home. <br/></p>

<br/><h3>Basic goal: $1000</h3>

</h3>
<h4>Launching the app<br/>
</h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our basic goal is to raise 1000 USD to help us with finishing and launching the Walpie app both for Android and iPhone. We have already spent a lot of money from our own pockets in order to get to this point, but raising this amount would greatly help us in getting to the completion of this project. <br/></p>
<br/><h3>Longshot goal: $7000</h3>
<h4>Walpie Sniffer</h4>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Do you believe in miracles? We sincerely do, and so does Walpie. We know gathering 7000 USD is a longshot, but such things do happen sometimes. We have a plan that would greatly benefit from such generosity on your part. The plan is to take the Walpie project to a whole new level with the WALPIE SNIFFER network. </p>
<p>Walpie Sniffer is a feature we wish to develop as part of the Walpie app, that uses your internet connection, and a worldwide server system to keep track of GPS locations of all Walpie users in real-time. Such a feature would enable you to find the nearest users with Walpie running on their smartphone with the goal of encouraging you to find them on the street, approach them and become friends. <br/></p>
<p>If the two of you start walking together, you'll both get increased Walpiness points for your walk, a a few other fun surprises. </p>
<p>Since this feature would require some additional development time, the first version of the app, predicted to be launched at some point until May of 2015, might not have this feature. In that case, an update would be provided later to all the funders which would add the Walpie Sniffer feature to their apps. <br/></p>
<p>While, not yet designed, the interface of the Walpie Sniffer feature will show you an arrow pointing the direction in which you'll find the nearest Walpie user, and approximate the distance at which you might find them. The rest is up to you. Figure out a way to approach them and start a conversation without being too awkward... <br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Every dollar you support us with will be appreciated and rewarded with a gift and our sincere thanks. But sometimes we come across people who surprise us with truly generous contributions, and these people deserve something special from us. For that reason we have worked out three PREMIUM REWARDS for very large contributions. </p>

<p>In the Gold Edition of the Walpie app, your personal name will appear in several places including the customized splash screen and the info page which you can open anytime you wish to brag to your friends that you had a custom version of the app made specially for you. Oh, and one more thing... <br/></p>
<p>We'll let you in on a little secret: Walpie speaks from time to time. Sometimes we are having trouble understanding him like Mr. MITS does, but with his help, we'll implement a ""meowslator"" feature which will translate Walpie's meows in the app. So don't be surprised if he mentions you sometimes in the app. </p>
<p>Only 100 personalized copies of the Walpie Gold Edition app will be made. <br/></p>

<br/>How would you like to speak with MITS himself? So far, very few people, outside of his circle of personal friends and acquaintances, had this privilege. As they say, he is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. But MITS has agreed to give a chance to 24 generous funders to get to know him better by speaking with him DIRECTLY through a special VIP message feature inside the app. This rare edition of the app will be called Walpie VIP Edition. If you own a copy of the VIP Edition app, you'll be able to send 1 message every day to Mr. MITS, and he'll give you a reply as soon as he is able, usually within 24 hours, and sometimes even instantly. You'll receive his reply INSIDE the app. <br/><br/>So what would one ask MITS anyway?<br/><br/>The most obvious question would be: What planet is he from? The less obvious ones would be: What is his favorite ice-cream flavor? What is the brand of the suit he is wearing in all the Walpie ads? Was he, by any chance, the guy you saw in the subway the other day?....<br/><br/>Whatever you ask him, he will give you an answer, as long as it doesn't jeopardize the secrecy surrounding his identity.

<p><br/></p>
<p>Having Walpie on your smartphone is cool and all, but experiencing him the old school way is something else. The core of the Walpie experience is ANALOG. Life is analog. We don't want you to get the wrong impression though: Walpie is the same, regardless of where he resides. But there is something special about interacting with Walpie through a pure analog medium like a vinyl record. It's DIRECT. <br/></p>
<p>If you are one of the 7 funders to contribute more than $400, besides having Walpie on your smartphone, you'll also have him on vinyl. The record you'll receive will be one of the only 7 copies to be pressed of this special record, since 1978. <br/></p>
<p>If you don't know what a vinyl record is, disregard all of this... Well, you can still contribute $400 and get a nice black plastic disk thingy. Just don't throw it to the dog like a Frisbee; Walpie will be insulted. <br/></p>

</div></div>","What you have seen here described is the essence of the WALPIE WALK.Walpie Walk is all about freedom, joy and groovyness in your feet. It's about feeling the uplifting and eternal beat of the universe and surrendering to it. The way to achieve the Walpie Walk is to follow in Walpie's cute little pawsteps. 
And who is Walpie?
Walpie is a cat creature of the species Walkopard (Panthera walkus). Walkopards are a recently discovered feline species. So far Walpie is the only known specimen of the Walkopard species. 
So where does Walpie live?
Right now we are building a brand new home for Walpie to live in; a smartphone app for Android and iOS. That means that each of you will be able to have Walpie on your smartphones very soon.
The main purpose of this app is to allow you to take a walk with Walpie whenever you please. The more you walk with him, the more you will become like him. That means that your WALPINESS score will increase. Walpiness score will unlock various features inside the game, and bring you certain rewards. 
Here you can see a screenshot of the main walking feature inside the app:
float: right;


Walpie app in walking modeThe way the walking works is using your GPS system to track your real movement. When you start walking, after a couple of steps, Walpie starts walking with you. If you think about cheating and turning the walking mode on when driving a car or a bicycle, think again! Walpie has his own thing going, his own rhythm and if you go too fast, he will drop out of your phone. Your app will be catless and empty from that moment on. But don't worry, you can return to that location later and pick him up. Just approach the right GPS location and he'll hop into your smartphone. 
For best results, be sure to turn the music on and try to walk in it's 105 BPM rhythm. This is the beat of the Walpie Walk. 
Before going out for a walk with Walpie, be sure to check his mood. Sometimes he feels like going out, and sometimes he feels like staying in. His tail will tell. The more he feels like walking, the more Walpiness score you get after each walk. 




Walpie tail mood testAlso, be sure to check how shiny his fur is in the fur gloss test. If it's not shiny enough, you'll have go give him enough privacy (behind the curtain) to lick himself. After a good licking session, he's good to go. 


The licking curtainYour advancement in Walpiness will unlock several songs which Walpie can sing for you. His meowing and singing sounds like a Hammond electric organ from the 60's and 70's popular music.

Pawsteps minigameEvery now and then, Walpie comes to us with a brand new idea for what he'd like to have in his new home, so don't be surprised if other cool features appear by the time you get your hands on the finished app.




So where on earth did Walpie come from? Well...we're not so sure about the ""Earth"" part, but...well, it's a long and weird story and here is the short version.
You might have noticed that on the beginning of our pitch page we've quoted someone named ""Mr. MITS"". This is the man behind the curtain who started this whole thing. It was him who discovered Walpie in the first place.

enlighten and capture moments that may otherwise be forgotten.The answers to these simple questions will not only be captured in the documentary but will also be shared via our website (www.sniop.co.uk) and popular social networking platforms; Facebook and Twitter.    We will also establish a Youtube channel for the transmission of all the interviews conducted; a resource that will live well beyond the projects origins and its creators.  SNIOP is intended as a continuing project; capturing social history and depicting changing attitudes and beliefs. Think of it as an ever evolving time capsule of the human spirit. We also want to reach beyond the screen and create real, tangible change.  Therefore, this will be a non-profit project, donating any and all of its profits to a variety of charities doing wonderful work across the globe. This includes profits derived from sponsorship, DVD sales, downloads of the film, and sales of the book of selected photographs and interviews.In 2015, we have reached a point in time where it’s easier than ever to share experiences and reach out to one another. SNIOP intends to embrace the technological advances we have made as a worldwide society and bring voices to light that may otherwise be forgotten. Created with passion and joy, SNIOP will share these voices far and wide, so we can learn from and hopefully make a difference to all our futures.Thank you for reading and for the opportunity to make SNIOP a reality.Brian M Franklin (Creator & Director)",4.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<div><p><b>A sensorial exploration of a relationship in old age; a film </b><b style=""background-color: initial;"">centred around those small moments in life shared with our loved ones, and the impact they have on us.</b></p></div>
<div>
<p>Our film focuses on David, an elderly man, as he takes care of his wife Helen, an aged potter, who is now frail and unable to completely take care of herself. We follow their joint struggles and the issues they face each passing day.</p>
<p>When Helen is resting, David visits her old pottery studio as a means of getting away from it all. It is here where David can concentrate on something in his control - the clay, his wife's previous love. </p>
<p>As David shapes the clay, memories are brought back to life through a focus on the senses, primarily that of the touch; a process that provides an insight into their relationship and David's inner world and conflict. </p>
<p>These moments are short-lived however, as David has to return to the aid of his wife Helen. How long can David live like this, and will he always be able to provide the care Helen needs?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Why We Need You?</b></h3>
<div>
<b></b><p></p>
<p>Having already contributed a
collective amount of £750 ourselves, we are now hoping to raise a further
£1,250 in order to make the best possible version of the film. The money raised
will be spent on a number of things, including <span>payment
for our four member cast (Old David and Helen and the actors playing their
younger selves), </span><span>period props and clothing, travel
expenses and equipment hire amongst other things. Contributions of any kind
will be greatly appreciated.</span></p>

<p>The

putting these great locations on screen.</p>

<p>We are very fortunate to have

<p>Our approach to shooting will
vary depending on the content of each scene. Inside the house, shots will be
static with the takes longer so that time appears to pass at a steady pace. Once
David enters the pottery studio, slow-moving camera movements will enhance this
slower perception of time. Certain shots will linger, on tools, drawings and
objects of the past – all in order to portray David's nostalgia and to set up
his journey down memory lane. </p>
<p>Once David’s memory kicks in,
time will flow faster with the cuts much snappier as a result of David's inability
to recall certain exact conversations, with some parts being distorted or
completely inaudible. The memories that David will be able to recall, and the
happiness they bring, will be short lived and always in contrast with the rest
of the film.</p>

A sensorial exploration of a relationship in old age; a film centred around those small moments in life shared with our loved ones, and the impact they have on us.

Our film focuses on David, an elderly man, as he takes care of his wife Helen, an aged potter, who is now frail and unable to completely take care of herself. We follow their joint struggles and the issues they face each passing day.
When Helen is resting, David visits her old pottery studio as a means of getting away from it all. It is here where David can concentrate on something in his control - the clay, his wife's previous love. 
As David shapes the clay, memories are brought back to life through a focus on the senses, primarily that of the touch; a process that provides an insight into their relationship and David's inner world and conflict. 
These moments are short-lived however, as David has to return to the aid of his wife Helen. How long can David live like this, and will he always be able to provide the care Helen needs?

will be spent on a number of things, including payment
for our four member cast (Old David and Helen and the actors playing their

The
majority of the film will take place in two main locations - Helen's pottery
studio and David and Helen's rural cottage. Both of these locations have
already been secured and so we are now very excited about getting in there and

Helen's Pottery Studio




This is where David comes to mould and shape the clay, in the same way that his wife Helen used to do. The process relaxes him and allows him to remember past memories of them both together, moments before Helen became frail. The pottery studio itself is still a working studio bringing an element of authenticity to the feel and aesthetics of the space. 




David and Helen's Rural Cottage







A three bedroom rural cottage where David and Helen have
lived for many years. The garage in the garden will double for Helen's old
pottery studio in the film.

<p>I've been trying to find a way to supplement my commercial photography with something that leaves a lasting positive impact on a global scale, so when Mama Hope asked me to become a volunteer in their Global Advocate program, I knew it was a great fit! <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm going to be traveling with Mama Hope to document development projects that create social infrastructure that will ensure the community's self-sustainability. Before I go, I'm raising $8,900 to continue production of Mama Hope's Stop the Pity </span>campaign that went viral 2 years ago. The videos were viewed millions of times and helped generate funds to complete more projects in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Ghana. These videos and the funding they generate will directly affect hundreds of thousands of lives, and have a major impact on generations to come.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I need to raise $10,000, and I'm already on my way to that goal, which is why I'm asking for $8,900. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Production of media is not cheap, but we're scrappy and we can accomplish a lot on a shoestring budget. The goal is to produce 2 profile short films highlighting community leaders in Africa, the natives that are striving to make their </span>communities<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the best they can be. We are also in talks about a collaboration with local schools to interview and photograph 8th graders from a San Francisco private school and 8th graders from the Akili girls' school in Kenya. The photos will be made into a book and sold with all profits going to support more development projects in East Africa.</span></p>
<p>Camera equipment (lighting, lenses, rigs) - $3,500</p>
<p>Travel (to and from Africa) - $2,500</p>
<p>Expenses in country (food, transportation, etc) - $1,000</p>
<p>Post production on videos - $1,500</p>
<p>Initial publishing costs of books - $1,500</p>
<p><b>PERKS</b></p>
<p>$1 or more - Everyone that contributes will get a producer credit in the films we make</p>
<p>$20 or more - Not only will you get producer credits in the film, but you will also get your name printed in the book on a ""special thanks"" page (25 available)</p>
<p>$50 or more -You will receive a printed 8x10"" portrait from my journey, an edition of 25 (25 available)</p>

<p>$250 or more - Signed softcover book of portraits of the 8th graders mentioned above (5 available)</p>
<p>$500 or more - Signed hardcover special edition book of the 8th graders mentioned above (5 available)</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We are heavily influenced by all of the media we consume daily. It's extremely important for these stories to be seen, which is why Mama Hope has asked me to take time off work and create movies and still images that tell the story of the amazing development happening in these small communities of East Africa. We know that showing the world these compelling stories will generate the much needed funding for Mama Hope to continue their partnerships with the leaders on the ground.</p>
<p>Mama Hope has already completed over 50 projects in 4 countries and directly impacted 150,000 souls. The partnerships they build  are sound, but also meant to be temporary. We are there as a partnership, providing the resources they need to complete self-identified projects using all local contractors. The money stays in the system, we help build a local, sustainable economy, and then we leave them to it.</p>
<p>With globalization on the rise, we need to turn our attention to Africa. The world is shrinking, and soon Africa's child population will be ready to enter the new global workforce. First they need the opportunity to prepare through great health and education. Your donations will help that happen. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We don't have the answers to their problems, but we do have the humility to admit that. That's why we put so much emphasis on the partnership and teaming up with the people that grew up in the community to help them complete their goals. </p>
<p>It's really tough to break the stereotype of Africa as a war torn, starving, diseased continent, and the truth is that all of that exists.

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Tom Kubik and I'm a commercial photographer based in San Francisco. 
I've been trying to find a way to supplement my commercial photography with something that leaves a lasting positive impact on a global scale, so when Mama Hope asked me to become a volunteer in their Global Advocate program, I knew it was a great fit! I'm going to be traveling with Mama Hope to document development projects that create social infrastructure that will ensure the community's self-sustainability. Before I go, I'm raising $8,900 to continue production of Mama Hope's Stop the Pity campaign that went viral 2 years ago. The videos were viewed millions of times and helped generate funds to complete more projects in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and Ghana. These videos and the funding they generate will directly affect hundreds of thousands of lives, and have a major impact on generations to come.   What We Need & What You Get I need to raise $10,000, and I'm already on my way to that goal, which is why I'm asking for $8,900. Production of media is not cheap, but we're scrappy and we can accomplish a lot on a shoestring budget. The goal is to produce 2 profile short films highlighting community leaders in Africa, the natives that are striving to make their communities the best they can be. We are also in talks about a collaboration with local schools to interview and photograph 8th graders from a San Francisco private school and 8th graders from the Akili girls' school in Kenya. The photos will be made into a book and sold with all profits going to support more development projects in East Africa.
Camera equipment (lighting, lenses, rigs) - $3,500
Travel (to and from Africa) - $2,500
Expenses in country (food, transportation, etc) - $1,000
Post production on videos - $1,500
Initial publishing costs of books - $1,500
PERKS
$1 or more - Everyone that contributes will get a producer credit in the films we make
$20 or more - Not only will you get producer credits in the film, but you will also get your name printed in the book on a ""special thanks"" page (25 available)
$50 or more -You will receive a printed 8x10"" portrait from my journey, an edition of 25 (25 available)
$100 or more - You will receive a video shout out on social media from Africa that will be featured on the blog (5 available)
$250 or more - Signed softcover book of portraits of the 8th graders mentioned above (5 available)
$500 or more - Signed hardcover special edition book of the 8th graders mentioned above (5 available)
    The Impact We are heavily influenced by all of the media we consume daily. It's extremely important for these stories to be seen, which is why Mama Hope has asked me to take time off work and create movies and still images that tell the story of the amazing development happening in these small communities of East Africa. We know that showing the world these compelling stories will generate the much needed funding for Mama Hope to continue their partnerships with the leaders on the ground.
Mama Hope has already completed over 50 projects in 4 countries and directly impacted 150,000 souls. The partnerships they build  are sound, but also meant to be temporary. We are there as a partnership, providing the resources they need to complete self-identified projects using all local contractors. The money stays in the system, we help build a local, sustainable economy, and then we leave them to it.
With globalization on the rise, we need to turn our attention to Africa. The world is shrinking, and soon Africa's child population will be ready to enter the new global workforce. First they need the opportunity to prepare through great health and education. Your donations will help that happen. 
    Risks & Challenges We don't have the answers to their problems, but we do have the humility to admit that. That's why we put so much emphasis on the partnership and teaming up with the people that grew up in the community to help them complete their goals. 
It's really tough to break the stereotype of Africa as a war torn, starving, diseased continent, and the truth is that all of that exists. There's another equally valid truth, and that is all of the progress that's being made. The more we can enlighten people to the idea that progress is happening, the more people will have faith in development, and the more people will care about what's going on in Africa. With the continent supporting 15% of humans and growing, we need to ensure they have the resources they need to be successful.

<div>We have been working on the preparation and script since last November, but now it's time to make the film.

<div>We wish to upgrade our existing equipment to get the best possible quality. At the climax of our movie we'll be working with up to 70 young people.

<div>2) £11,000 - Staff Pre &amp; Post Production</div>
<div>As film-makers, we put a lot of our own time and money into the pre-production, but we need full-time staff on board to ensure the the movie's completion. Good will is great, but it won't pay the staff's wages, I'm afraid.</div>
<div>3) £4,000- Crew Travel &amp; Accommodation</div>

So I decided to embark on a journey to make this film. With no financial backing I used my own time, funds and resources to begin this project. Over time the project grew and I realized the importance of making the best film possible </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">so this important message could reach the masses and make a positive impact on peoples lives, on the health of the planet and on the lives of animals. </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As the project became more elaborate so did the production expenses. Thanks to a previous crowd funding campaign and donations from family and friends I was able to push through and record 32 interviews around the country with amazing people such as doctors, nutritionists, researchers, best selling authors, environmentalists, chefs, athletes, celebrities, bloggers, rockstars, regular people I met during my trip and many others, to try to get a wider perspective and understanding of the impact of our food choices. </span><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1394844/files/20150418113648-people.jpg?1429382208"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/><br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Last month we finalized the interview recording stage of the production process.

Just 3 years ago at age 32, I was over 50 pounds overweight, weighing 220lbs at 5'7"", my blood pressure was high, my cholesterol was through the roof and my sugar was so high that the doctor said I was in a pre-diabetic stage. After trying several yo-yo diets for a couple years I ran into information about a plant based diet and decided to give it a shot. It was a hard transition for the first few weeks but I got used to it and really began to enjoy this new diet and lifestyle. After a year on this diet I re did the blood tests and to my and the doctors surprise all levels went back to normal. And what's great about it is that I didn't have to buy any supplements (aside from vitamin B12), take any medication or subscribe to any diet programs, it was all in the food! I really wish that more people got access to this information so they could also transform their lives and improve their health.</span><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Studies and statistics from all over the world show us that there is an epidemic of obesity, cancer and chronic degenerative diseases such as diabetes and hearth disease, in america and all over the world.

Unfortunately that is the truth. The meat, dairy and fishing industries have a devastating effect on our planet. The global population will reach 8 billion people in the next couple decades, and the future looks grim. It is impossible to feed that many people on a carnivorous diet.  Simply put there is not enough land, water and animal feed to produce enough meat for 8 billion people. </span><br/><br/><span style=""text-align: center; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It is important to take action now, become aware of the impact that food choices have on our lives and decide if it's worth it or not making a change.

More and more physicians adhere to this practice every day. Hundreds of studies have been done on the effects of a plant based diet on health. The most notorious one, called the China Study was conducted by Dr. T Colin Campbell PHD (featured in this film) in conjunction with Cornell University, Oxford University in London and several universities in China.

</div><div><br/></div><div>**The statements made above are solely based on the personal experiences and interviews done by the filmmaker and are by no means to be considered as health advice from the filmmaker.  </div></div>","I began working on this documentary two years ago, after experiencing the amazing effects that a plant based diet had on my health. At that point I also realized that there where many films that talked about food, but few discussed the wide spectrum of the impact and effects that our food choices have on our health, on the health of the planet and on the lives of other species. So I decided to embark on a journey to make this film. With no financial backing I used my own time, funds and resources to begin this project. Over time the project grew and I realized the importance of making the best film possible so this important message could reach the masses and make a positive impact on peoples lives, on the health of the planet and on the lives of animals. As the project became more elaborate so did the production expenses. Thanks to a previous crowd funding campaign and donations from family and friends I was able to push through and record 32 interviews around the country with amazing people such as doctors, nutritionists, researchers, best selling authors, environmentalists, chefs, athletes, celebrities, bloggers, rockstars, regular people I met during my trip and many others, to try to get a wider perspective and understanding of the impact of our food choices. Last month we finalized the interview recording stage of the production process. We have over 60 hours of footage. We reached a point where we really want to make the best film possible and need a little help to cover costs of post-production expenses such as professional editing, music score and the graphics and animations that I want to have placed throughout the film to help reinforce the message and tell this story in an informative and entertaining way. And that's where you can really help make a difference! :)WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO FINISH THIS FILM?People often ask me why am I dedicating so much time, effort and resources on this film. There is no short answer to that, but basically it is because I believe it has an important message and I also believe that it can make a difference in people's lives and hopefully to some extent on the health of our planet and on the lives of other species. I know this is just one film and it won't change the world by itself, but by raising awareness and joining efforts we can all begin making a difference.THE IMPACT OF FOOD CHOICES ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH:*According to several studies (some sources listed below), a carnivorous diet can potentially have several effects on our health. **Sources: PCRM.org, Stanford.edu, WHO (World Health Organization), The China Study, T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies, The Starch Solution (Dr. John McDougall), nutritionfacts.org.I experienced first hand the positive impact that a plant based diet can have on health. Just 3 years ago at age 32, I was over 50 pounds overweight, weighing 220lbs at 5'7"", my blood pressure was high, my cholesterol was through the roof and my sugar was so high that the doctor said I was in a pre-diabetic stage. After trying several yo-yo diets for a couple years I ran into information about a plant based diet and decided to give it a shot. It was a hard transition for the first few weeks but I got used to it and really began to enjoy this new diet and lifestyle. After a year on this diet I re did the blood tests and to my and the doctors surprise all levels went back to normal. And what's great about it is that I didn't have to buy any supplements (aside from vitamin B12), take any medication or subscribe to any diet programs, it was all in the food! I really wish that more people got access to this information so they could also transform their lives and improve their health.Studies and statistics from all over the world show us that there is an epidemic of obesity, cancer and chronic degenerative diseases such as diabetes and hearth disease, in america and all over the world. And the numbers are rising. Many experts believe that a plant based diet can help. I interviewed several health authorities and experts for this film to try get an understating of these facts.THE IMPACT OF FOOD CHOICES ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND ON THE LIVES OF OTHER SPECIES:**Sources: FAO (Food and agriculture organization of the United Nations), WHO (World Health Organization), UN (United Nations), Food Choices and Sustainability (Dr. Richard Oppenlander).Many people get surprised when they hear that the food they eat can affect global warming, produce massive amounts of CO2, methane and nitric oxide emissions, diminish our fresh water supply, contribute to the depletion of our natural resources, destroy the amazon forest, destroy our top soil, completely deplete our oceans beyond repair, create massive amounts of pollution and several other factors. Unfortunately that is the truth. The meat, dairy and fishing industries have a devastating effect on our planet. The global population will reach 8 billion people in the next couple decades, and the future looks grim. It is impossible to feed that many people on a carnivorous diet.  Simply put there is not enough land, water and animal feed to produce enough meat for 8 billion people. It is important to take action now, become aware of the impact that food choices have on our lives and decide if it's worth it or not making a change. I don't believe that ""veganism"" will solve all the problems of our world, but I strongly believe that it must at least be part of the solution.HOW CAN A PLANT BASED DIET IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH?**Sources: PCRM.org, Stanford.edu, WHO (World Health Organization), The China Study, T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies, The Starch Solution (Dr. John McDougall), nutritionfacts.org.Several studies suggest that a plant based diet can positively affect your health, millions of people around the world are experiencing the healing effects of this diet and lifestyle. Renowned doctors such as John McDougall M.D. (featured in this film), use a plant based diet approach to prevent and treat patients with a wide array of conditions. More and more physicians adhere to this practice every day. Hundreds of studies have been done on the effects of a plant based diet on health. The most notorious one, called the China Study was conducted by Dr. T Colin Campbell PHD (featured in this film) in conjunction with Cornell University, Oxford University in London and several universities in China. The study lasted 27 years and analyzed the impact that diet (more specifically animal and plant based protein) had on promoting and preventing disease. Many people are learning that the best way to loose weight is by adopting a whole foods plant based diet (whole foods meaning foods close to their natural state). Many athletes are discovering that they can gain more lean muscle, lose fat and improve their athletic performance by adopting this diet. People such as world champion ultra marathon athlete Hilary Biscay and world class triathlete Rich Roll, who I had the pleasure to interview for this film are 100% fueled by plants! HOW CAN A PLANT BASED DIET HELP OUR PLANET AND SAVE THE LIVES OF OTHER SPECIES?**Sources: FAO (Food and agriculture organization of the United Nations), WHO (World Health Organization), UN (United Nations), Food Choices and Sustainability (Dr. Richard Oppenlander).80 billion land animals and over a trillion fish and sea animals are killed every year for human consumption. Aside of the massive pain, suffering and torture inflicted to these animals our entire planet suffers as several ecosystems are disrupted affecting thousands of species of both plant and animals. By choosing a plant based diet you will be helping the planet and the animals in many ways.

How does that relate to world hunger? Imagine that we used that same land to produce plant based foods such as, vegetables, grains, fruits, legumes, etc... There is a lot of confusion and misinformation out there. For example, many people are shifting to organic, grass fed meats, thinking they are doing good for the planet and for the animals, but even thought the animals might live a better life when compared to the deplorable conditions they are raised in the factory farms, they are still slaughtered in the same way. There is no humane slaughterhouse in the United States. Another fact that goes unmentioned is that grass fed beef is countless times more destructive to our planet. One cow needs a minimum of 1 to 2 acres of land to graze. After a couple years, once the animal gets killed it will render in average 300 to 400 pounds of meat. Those same 2 acres of land could potentially generate 20 to 30 thousand pounds of plant based food per year. You do the math...

<p><span>Director's Statement: I wrote this story because it was very personal to me while at the same time relatable to a broad audience. Nina is about an everyday girl trying to rediscover herself through music though her story could be reflected in any person trying to pursue something and coming to a point where what they’re doing loses meaning.  Sometimes in our lives we get too focused on one thing and forget to remember what is around us. Nina is a call to that. The death of Nina’s grandfather causes Nina to reflect on everything that is going on her life and her passion for music. I have faced similar struggles in my own life with art. Trying to be creative constantly and realizing that sometimes doing what you love doesn’t come easily to you. Especially when things happen in your life that are out of your control.</span></p>I have been blessed with the most loving and caring family in my real life who have supported me through the good and bad, guiding me through my toughest decisions. In this sense Nina’s family is guiding her through her depression and is her lantern through the dark after her grandfather’s death. They prove to be her inspiration, but even with that Nina needs to let herself grieve and find it in herself to be happy again.<p></p>

We’ve scrimped and saved for this project, but as with all filmmaking this is a team effort and we want you to be a part of our team. We’ve done the math and we’re asking for the bare minimum to make this short a reality. 
Our entire cast and crew are volunteering their services for this project so we’re trying to make this set the best environment it can be for them. This includes having all of the proper working equipment, supplies, the best transportation and housing for them, and the best meals to make sure they have enough energy for the long days. We also want to make sure the buck doesn’t stop when the cameras stop rolling. We want to make sure we can get a score that will be as good as the film and we want to send this short to as many suitable festivals as possible. 


If we don’t reach our entire goal the film will still be made. We’ve got a plan B, C, and D to make sure this film reaches fruition. 

Fret not over number, charts, and graphs because we also have goodies for you. T-shirts, posters, your own digital download, this list goes on as you can see in the right side column!

We understand the internet is a dark and scary place with lots of people who want your money for nothing so why are we trustworthy?We have the backing of Emerson College. This includes a multitude of equipment, the experienced guidance of our acclaimed professors, and the support of the entire film department. This includes providing us with months of pre-production workshops with other professionals, insurance, and experience of our own. Through the Emerson community we’ve all been on a multitude of sets, production meetings, editing rooms, and every imaginable aspect of production. We’ve built a formidable repertoire of knowledge and plan to use it at a larger scale now for this project.

Campaign Calendar: We’ll be sending you continual updates and behind the scenes perks throughout the duration of shooting and post-production.
August 3rd-6th--Final Cast read-throughs and production meeting
August 7th-9th-- First weekend of shooting
August 14th-16th--Second weekend of shooting
September 1st-- Post production beginsJanuary 2016--Release date
You can help us in all sorts of ways! Donations of any kind (especially the edible kind) are always welcome. Quite possibly the biggest way you can help us is by helping us spread the word about our short. Don’t forget to share the campaign using the handy Ingiegogo share tools.


Director's Statement: I wrote this story because it was very personal to me while at the same time relatable to a broad audience. Nina is about an everyday girl trying to rediscover herself through music though her story could be reflected in any person trying to pursue something and coming to a point where what they’re doing loses meaning.  Sometimes in our lives we get too focused on one thing and forget to remember what is around us. Nina is a call to that. The death of Nina’s grandfather causes Nina to reflect on everything that is going on her life and her passion for music. I have faced similar struggles in my own life with art. Trying to be creative constantly and realizing that sometimes doing what you love doesn’t come easily to you. Especially when things happen in your life that are out of your control.I have been blessed with the most loving and caring family in my real life who have supported me through the good and bad, guiding me through my toughest decisions. In this sense Nina’s family is guiding her through her depression and is her lantern through the dark after her grandfather’s death. They prove to be her inspiration, but even with that Nina needs to let herself grieve and find it in herself to be happy again.",7.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Reverend Byron Breese is an ordained Baptist minister, with a strong history in pluralism. Jeff Wolfe is a long time solar entrepreneur and climate activist.</p>
<p>The basis of the symposium is that <b>all spiritualities and faiths are rooted in work for social justice and deep care for our children</b>. Recognizing that climate disruption will be the largest creator of social injustice, especially against our children, we believe that <b>working to fight climate disruption is central to a life of faith and spirituality</b>.</p>
<p>Over our first two years (2013 and 2014, I misspoke in the video!) we achieved much. We found out that <b>our thesis was new</b>, had not been discussed. When we created the conversation, <b>people of many faiths and spiritualities listened</b>. People in environmental movements listened. We now are beginning to hear that faith and spirituality have a role to play in motivating action for many people. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">But our work is far from over. More and larger groups are hearing our message. We have reached <b>Unitarians, Congregationalists, Baptists, Muslims, Buddhists, Pagans, Wiccans, Native Americans, and Spiritualists</b>. We are beginning to reach even more faiths, from southeast Sikh to Protestant Fundamentalist. And we are uncovering an associated need of activists, for grieving, recovery, and long term support.</span></p>
<p>We normally raise our funds by winning a couple low 4-figure grants, quite a few small donations from friends, and registration fees ($75 or what you can afford). <b>We are non-profit </b>(all funds go through our local Unitarian Universalist Church and are tax deductible) But this year we are adding:</p>
<p> - a 2 day overnight <b>Young Adult Summit</b> where 18-30 year olds will share stories, train, and teach each other in climate activism while exploring their own spiritual connections, guided or individually.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary The Our Children, Climate, Faith Symposium was founded to create and further the connection between faith, spirituality, and religion, and acting on climate disruption. Reverend Byron Breese is an ordained Baptist minister, with a strong history in pluralism. Jeff Wolfe is a long time solar entrepreneur and climate activist.
The basis of the symposium is that all spiritualities and faiths are rooted in work for social justice and deep care for our children. Recognizing that climate disruption will be the largest creator of social injustice, especially against our children, we believe that working to fight climate disruption is central to a life of faith and spirituality.
Over our first two years (2013 and 2014, I misspoke in the video!) we achieved much. We found out that our thesis was new, had not been discussed. When we created the conversation, people of many faiths and spiritualities listened. People in environmental movements listened. We now are beginning to hear that faith and spirituality have a role to play in motivating action for many people. But our work is far from over. More and larger groups are hearing our message. We have reached Unitarians, Congregationalists, Baptists, Muslims, Buddhists, Pagans, Wiccans, Native Americans, and Spiritualists. We are beginning to reach even more faiths, from southeast Sikh to Protestant Fundamentalist. And we are uncovering an associated need of activists, for grieving, recovery, and long term support.
We normally raise our funds by winning a couple low 4-figure grants, quite a few small donations from friends, and registration fees ($75 or what you can afford). We are non-profit (all funds go through our local Unitarian Universalist Church and are tax deductible) But this year we are adding:
 - a 2 day overnight Young Adult Summit where 18-30 year olds will share stories, train, and teach each other in climate activism while exploring their own spiritual connections, guided or individually.
 - a 2 day camp program for pre-K to 17 year olds, making it easier for families to attend the symposium.
See our website for more information on current and past programs. www.FaithClimateConference.org
We have already achieved so much with very little. That's why we're not looking for much here, we will do a lot with a little more. Every dollar is amplified by 20x compared to any other symposium I have been involved in, due to donations of time, talent, and resources.
We have already changed the conversation. Help us to drive that change further, for a better, more just planet, for our children.

over from other countries and provide them with what they need to get a
solid education in Japan.  That will in turn lead to a stronger and
more diverse population and really help shape the future of this country.
 A little more on them; before I was willing to donate to them, I
wanted to meet someone at their office and make sure they were good
people, so I took a trip to Tokyo.  I was really glad to see that their offices are humble and

<p><b>Gekka</b> is the result of two people meeting and discovering a
common interest in charity and creativity.  Founder Jon Chamberlain, met
creative director Erik Svare when he needed some custom t-shirts made for a
party.  After meeting with Erik at his original brand shop (<a href=""http://www.vivalamort.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Viva La Mort</span></a>), Jon fell in
love with the creative design work and the inspiration behind each piece. 
Amazingly, Jon was looking for a designer at that time to help him build an
idea.  The idea was a grass roots, creativity driven project that would
result in being able to give back to a worthy cause.  A few months down
the road, Gekka came to life. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432977337/bxu0cmldxa4ibcuqy5st.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><b>We</b> </b>decided to call our brand Gekka (which means ""under the moon"" in Japanese).

<p><b>Gekka</b> is in the process of collaborating with other artists from
all over the world to create an ongoing stream of creativity.  Erik said this about collaboration: ""I would love to be able to work with all kinds of artists on this project, which I think could be beneficial to all parties involved, not to mention fun! I want to present each artists name next to their design in the web shop, and on hang tags in physical stores, to give them credit for their work and move away from the typical anonymously designed tee. We can help them, they can help us, and together we can help kids. That is awesome!""  Erik's designs are all hand drawn, only using the computer to create a digital file from the original drawing. Silk screens are then made and the graphics are hand screened
onto the clothing in our shop.  Please take a look for yourself at what we

<p><b>Feel free to contact either one of us with any questions you might have at any time!  We will get back to you very quickly and we also just love hearing from people!  In the meantime, here are a few of the questions we've been asked already.</b></p>
<p><b>Where do you ship to?</b> - Everywhere!  We can ship to any country in the world. Shipping internationally from Japan can be a little expensive but we've done our best to keep it as low as possible. Shipping prices are included in reward descriptions and must be added on the next page.  All shipping is express and includes tracking and insurance.</p>
<p><b>What does ""Gekka"" mean?</b> - Gekka (月下) literally translates to ""under the moon"" from Japanese.  We used this as inspiration for our name, logo, and story.</p>
<p><b>How do I choose which items and sizes I want?</b> - After the campaign is over, we will be sending you a link to a page where you can choose the ones you want!</p>
<p><b>Are Japanese sizes different?</b> - Japanese sizes tend to be a bit smaller than Western sizes.  When choosing your items, it is a good idea to choose one size larger than you would usually in Western countries.</p>
<p><b>Can you use chopsticks?</b> - YES!</p>
<p>We are so excited and grateful that you took the time to look at our campaign page. If you believe in what we are trying to do, please share it with your friends in any way that you can to help us make this dream a reality!  Don't forget to follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for more updates in the future.  One last thing...

Thanks to the great people at Crosley Radio, we are able to offer a Crosley Cruiser Portable Turntable that we've customized with a hand screened Gekka logo. Thank you again to Crosley and we are excited to see who will pick up this one of a kind reward. Learn more about Crosley Radio's products at  www.crosleyradio.com 


Gekka is in the process of collaborating with other artists from
all over the world to create an ongoing stream of creativity.  Erik said this about collaboration: ""I would love to be able to work with all kinds of artists on this project, which I think could be beneficial to all parties involved, not to mention fun! I want to present each artists name next to their design in the web shop, and on hang tags in physical stores, to give them credit for their work and move away from the typical anonymously designed tee. We can help them, they can help us, and together we can help kids. That is awesome!""  Erik's designs are all hand drawn, only using the computer to create a digital file from the original drawing. Silk screens are then made and the graphics are hand screened
onto the clothing in our shop.  Please take a look for yourself at what we
have come up with so far! Click HERE for a gallery of all of our products in high resolution!

We need to raise money to help
us further our dream of building our brand here in Japan, with plans to expand
in the future.  We are now a small operation and hope to grow, and spread
awareness about our brand, and mission as far as possible. We also would like to make our own shapes and patterns for t-shirts, hoodies, bags, etc., using locally sourced fabrics and working with manufacturers, and designers in Japan. 
 Your contributions will directly be supporting:
- Orphans all over the world via Ashinaga
- Our production costs
- Marketing to expand our
reach
- Development of future
products (We're just getting started!)


We have big plans to continue
creating unique new clothing while trying to make an impact on the world.
 Supporting us is more than just buying cool stuff.  It means you
support the idea of social entrepreneurship and believe in a system that allows
great ideas to not just help one, but many.  With your help, Gekka has the
potential to keep growing and do a lot of good throughout the world.
 Everybody starts somewhere and everyone needs some form of support at the
beginning.  Your support takes us from an idea, to a reality.  We
really appreciate you taking the time to be here and look forward to having you
be part of our team.  Let's do this!


Feel free to contact either one of us with any questions you might have at any time!  We will get back to you very quickly and we also just love hearing from people!  In the meantime, here are a few of the questions we've been asked already.
Where do you ship to? - Everywhere!  We can ship to any country in the world. Shipping internationally from Japan can be a little expensive but we've done our best to keep it as low as possible. Shipping prices are included in reward descriptions and must be added on the next page.  All shipping is express and includes tracking and insurance.
What does ""Gekka"" mean? - Gekka (月下) literally translates to ""under the moon"" from Japanese.  We used this as inspiration for our name, logo, and story.
How do I choose which items and sizes I want? - After the campaign is over, we will be sending you a link to a page where you can choose the ones you want!
Are Japanese sizes different? - Japanese sizes tend to be a bit smaller than Western sizes.  When choosing your items, it is a good idea to choose one size larger than you would usually in Western countries.
Can you use chopsticks? - YES!
We are so excited and grateful that you took the time to look at our campaign page. If you believe in what we are trying to do, please share it with your friends in any way that you can to help us make this dream a reality!  Don't forget to follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for more updates in the future.  One last thing... Smile big!

<b>Put yourself in the seat with us as we document the Ukrainian war in Donbass. </b>I was the first western journalist writing about Ukraine from Donbass and the only one that has been here the entire time. I live here.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the one thing that has been made clear is the lack of unbiased western journalism and news coverage in Donbass covering the war. Kiev admits to propagandizing everything it releases to western media.</p>
<p> There have been no efforts to getting dedicated English language news video directly to western news and media from inside the LNR and DNR on a continual basis. Most efforts are geared for Russian speaking audiences first with English versions following as an afterthought.</p>

<p>We need funding for a news quality camera and accessories. With the camera, we will be able to bring substantial English language documentary video to the west and put you right there with us. </p>
<p>
<b>Our goal is to bring video footage to good news and alternative media websites that otherwise would not have access to video, documentaries, and commentary from Donbas in English direct to them- Free of Charge.</b></p>
<p> For the past year that's where most of our own income has been going and we are not going to change that. <b>We plan to continue helping the humanitarian effort in Donbass and expand on it by selling some of the news footage to news agencies. </b>That will help fund the humanitarian effort locally on a continuous basis.</p>
<p> We have been fortunate enough to be involved in humanitarian aid and distributing medication locally. We are also painfully aware of what happens when aid doesn't get to where it is needed. <b>Together we can help change this for the better.</b></p>
<p>
<b>For the camera and the needed accessories, we will need $4500</b>. This will cover all the transfer fees and give a complete news camera set up that is ready to go. We don't need the top of the line options but do require a camera with a lot of versatility to gain war footage and do interviews that has high resolution and is still unobtrusive.</p>
<p>Funding beyond that will go into the humanitarian effort and help fund documentary work directly in between news events. Documentary work by itself is an expensive endeavor if just transportation costs are added in. We will take you directly to the places that are being affected hardest by the war and let people speak for themselves.</p>
<p>
<b>The Impact your Funding will Make</b></p>
<p>Your funding will make a large impact in western media by making quality video footage continuously available to websites you know and trust. Currently its the lack of direct English language news coverage from the war that is the biggest news about it in the west. If a picture is worth a thousand words how much are direct footage and witnesses from the scene worth when the alternative is Ukrainian propaganda?</p>
<p>
<b>With your funding it will become very hard to keep the real facts out of mainstream media</b> because they will have to start looking at English language video from someone that has lived and reported from here the entire time. We will be providing quality news websites with interviews and asking their involvement on select interviews as we go. In many cases, this will mean the journalists you currently read will have input on the questions asked to the people shaping both the war and beginning of Novorussia.</p>
<p>Can we make an impact across the world together? The answer is yes, we can!</p>
<p>
<b>The Bakery Project</b></p>
<p>At the beginning of the Ukrainian war, Kiev started to blockade even critical medications like insulin and heart medications. When the fighting started it became a common practice for them to mine the grain fields across Donbass. By mid-summer, this happened in such a widespread pattern that it was easy to forecast a food shortage in Donbass through the winter and increasing until the next harvest happens. The fields had to be demined and thousands of acres remain unplanted today.</p>
<p>Nearby our location is a bread bakery that has been sitting idle for 2 years. The bakery is capable of providing bread for thousands of people continually if opened up again. Our plan to sell video footage to news agencies for resale originated in starting a self -sustaining humanitarian effort supported by news video footage sales. </p><p>This way the project may become self sustaining and help build the local economy by purchasing grain locally from farmers in need of cash, using the local grain mill, and hiring local people to work in the bakery itself. We will be able to provide a continuous  supply of bread where it is needed.</p>
<p>This is ultimately what your generosity is funding. Contrary to the Minsk Agreements Kiev is still blockading food and medication from entering Donbass. The aid Russia is giving will never be enough. </p>
<p>Together we can make a difference.</p><br/>

<p></p><p>
<b>For the past year, I have been writing breaking news and background articles about the events in Ukraine and Donbass including the earliest articles about the Ukrainian Nationalist coup in Kiev.</b> I've provided a lot of background articles so journalists could get their heads around what was really happening here.</p>
<p>When Kiev started mobilizing tanks and soldiers to Donbas I wrote the first articles to appear in the west. Starting with a mid-February article detailing why the war was coming and genocide with it I wrote about the importance of understanding the Ukrainian political program and how the Banderavites could not change.</p><p> I broke the news about the beginning of the war from the Good Friday attacks in Odessa through the Easter attacks in Slavyansk. We spoke to people on the ground throughout the region the whole time getting their real opinions out during the build-up to the referendum on May 11th and afterward.</p>
<p>
<b>I wrote the first detailed articles about the Odessa massacre to appear in the west and follow-ups as Kiev's complicity came into focus through evidence.</b></p>
<p>After that time we were able to provide first hand coverage of what it was like to be in an area under attack and then under the control of Pravy Sektor, the Natz Guardia, Donbass Battalion, etc. We gave first hand accounts of what it was like to be in a zone that was slated to be cleansed and only got a reprieve when the battle that turned the tide of the Ukrainian war happened literally one bus stop away from us.</p>
<p>When I've written about any Russian invasion never happening it's because the great “stealth invasion” of August 2014 would have knocked over the tomato plants in my garden to happen at all. In articles from that battle site, I took photos clearly showing how close the Russian border was to the site and noted my own location was directly in line of sight to it. In other words the invasion didin't happen.</p>
<p>
<b>I was the first western journalist to do invasive passport checks on soldiers in Donbass documenting where they were from.</b> I believe I am the only western journalist to do weapons checks for fabrication dates. These both provide the necessary proofs against a Russian invasion and modern Russian weapons in Donbass.</p>
<h3>During this time, my wife has become very involved and helps in research and documentation. Together we'll be making the documentaries. Together we will do the interviews. Making the humanitarian effort succeed is personal to her. She grew up in Donbass and we have many relatives and friends here.</h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's a war zone. The risks are real. The death and destruction are real and so are the crimes against humanity being perpetrated here. The challenges are multifold. Interviewing people and trying to protect their dignity or demand for privacy is paramount. We won't victimize our neighbors further any more than you would your own under these circumstances. Getting the truth out will happen but it can be done respectfully with people that have been hurt in this war already.</p>
<p>I think that is another point that separates us from other efforts. We were here before all of this started and we'll be here after it all ends. </p>
<p>Maintaining our own safety while collecting the documentary stories, war footage, and interviews takes planning and coordination. We already have that support structure in place as well as field helmets and vests. Part of the coordination effort is to know where the front line is at all times so you don't get caught on the wrong side which is bad, or in between which is worse.</p>
<p>We are planning on documenting the humanitarian aid effort that will stem from this effort after it gets going. Ultimately that is the larger goal for us. We feel that by providing the video proof of delivery on that end and with a little help we can build a close to self sustaining effort quickly. Initially we wanted to do this as a private effort. The situation made that impossible.</p>

Over the past year, the one thing that has been made clear is the lack of unbiased western journalism and news coverage in Donbass covering the war. Kiev admits to propagandizing everything it releases to western media.
 There have been no efforts to getting dedicated English language news video directly to western news and media from inside the LNR and DNR on a continual basis. Most efforts are geared for Russian speaking audiences first with English versions following as an afterthought.

What We Need & What You Get
We need funding for a news quality camera and accessories. With the camera, we will be able to bring substantial English language documentary video to the west and put you right there with us. 

Our goal is to bring video footage to good news and alternative media websites that otherwise would not have access to video, documentaries, and commentary from Donbas in English direct to them- Free of Charge.
 For the past year that's where most of our own income has been going and we are not going to change that. We plan to continue helping the humanitarian effort in Donbass and expand on it by selling some of the news footage to news agencies. That will help fund the humanitarian effort locally on a continuous basis.
 We have been fortunate enough to be involved in humanitarian aid and distributing medication locally. We are also painfully aware of what happens when aid doesn't get to where it is needed. Together we can help change this for the better.

For the camera and the needed accessories, we will need $4500. This will cover all the transfer fees and give a complete news camera set up that is ready to go. We don't need the top of the line options but do require a camera with a lot of versatility to gain war footage and do interviews that has high resolution and is still unobtrusive.
Funding beyond that will go into the humanitarian effort and help fund documentary work directly in between news events. Documentary work by itself is an expensive endeavor if just transportation costs are added in. We will take you directly to the places that are being affected hardest by the war and let people speak for themselves.

The Impact your Funding will Make
Your funding will make a large impact in western media by making quality video footage continuously available to websites you know and trust. Currently its the lack of direct English language news coverage from the war that is the biggest news about it in the west. If a picture is worth a thousand words how much are direct footage and witnesses from the scene worth when the alternative is Ukrainian propaganda?

With your funding it will become very hard to keep the real facts out of mainstream media because they will have to start looking at English language video from someone that has lived and reported from here the entire time. We will be providing quality news websites with interviews and asking their involvement on select interviews as we go. In many cases, this will mean the journalists you currently read will have input on the questions asked to the people shaping both the war and beginning of Novorussia.
Can we make an impact across the world together? The answer is yes, we can!

The Bakery Project
At the beginning of the Ukrainian war, Kiev started to blockade even critical medications like insulin and heart medications. When the fighting started it became a common practice for them to mine the grain fields across Donbass. By mid-summer, this happened in such a widespread pattern that it was easy to forecast a food shortage in Donbass through the winter and increasing until the next harvest happens. The fields had to be demined and thousands of acres remain unplanted today.
Nearby our location is a bread bakery that has been sitting idle for 2 years. The bakery is capable of providing bread for thousands of people continually if opened up again. Our plan to sell video footage to news agencies for resale originated in starting a self -sustaining humanitarian effort supported by news video footage sales. This way the project may become self sustaining and help build the local economy by purchasing grain locally from farmers in need of cash, using the local grain mill, and hiring local people to work in the bakery itself. We will be able to provide a continuous  supply of bread where it is needed.
This is ultimately what your generosity is funding. Contrary to the Minsk Agreements Kiev is still blockading food and medication from entering Donbass. The aid Russia is giving will never be enough. 
Together we can make a difference.

About Us

For the past year, I have been writing breaking news and background articles about the events in Ukraine and Donbass including the earliest articles about the Ukrainian Nationalist coup in Kiev. I've provided a lot of background articles so journalists could get their heads around what was really happening here.
When Kiev started mobilizing tanks and soldiers to Donbas I wrote the first articles to appear in the west. Starting with a mid-February article detailing why the war was coming and genocide with it I wrote about the importance of understanding the Ukrainian political program and how the Banderavites could not change. I broke the news about the beginning of the war from the Good Friday attacks in Odessa through the Easter attacks in Slavyansk. We spoke to people on the ground throughout the region the whole time getting their real opinions out during the build-up to the referendum on May 11th and afterward.

I wrote the first detailed articles about the Odessa massacre to appear in the west and follow-ups as Kiev's complicity came into focus through evidence.
After that time we were able to provide first hand coverage of what it was like to be in an area under attack and then under the control of Pravy Sektor, the Natz Guardia, Donbass Battalion, etc. We gave first hand accounts of what it was like to be in a zone that was slated to be cleansed and only got a reprieve when the battle that turned the tide of the Ukrainian war happened literally one bus stop away from us.
When I've written about any Russian invasion never happening it's because the great “stealth invasion” of August 2014 would have knocked over the tomato plants in my garden to happen at all. In articles from that battle site, I took photos clearly showing how close the Russian border was to the site and noted my own location was directly in line of sight to it. In other words the invasion didin't happen.

I was the first western journalist to do invasive passport checks on soldiers in Donbass documenting where they were from. I believe I am the only western journalist to do weapons checks for fabrication dates. These both provide the necessary proofs against a Russian invasion and modern Russian weapons in Donbass.
During this time, my wife has become very involved and helps in research and documentation. Together we'll be making the documentaries. Together we will do the interviews. Making the humanitarian effort succeed is personal to her. She grew up in Donbass and we have many relatives and friends here.
Risks & Challenges
It's a war zone. The risks are real. The death and destruction are real and so are the crimes against humanity being perpetrated here. The challenges are multifold. Interviewing people and trying to protect their dignity or demand for privacy is paramount. We won't victimize our neighbors further any more than you would your own under these circumstances. Getting the truth out will happen but it can be done respectfully with people that have been hurt in this war already.
I think that is another point that separates us from other efforts. We were here before all of this started and we'll be here after it all ends. 
Maintaining our own safety while collecting the documentary stories, war footage, and interviews takes planning and coordination. We already have that support structure in place as well as field helmets and vests. Part of the coordination effort is to know where the front line is at all times so you don't get caught on the wrong side which is bad, or in between which is worse.
We are planning on documenting the humanitarian aid effort that will stem from this effort after it gets going. Ultimately that is the larger goal for us. We feel that by providing the video proof of delivery on that end and with a little help we can build a close to self sustaining effort quickly. Initially we wanted to do this as a private effort. The situation made that impossible.
With only the camera in hand it will take a little time but we will be able to make a difference on that end. Our goal is to reopen a local bread bakery and bake humanitarian loaves. This was the initial reason behind the fund raising effort.

How fast this part starts is directly dependent on whether or not our initial goal is reached to purchase the camera and how far beyond that donations will go. If we fall short we will work with what we have to start with. This is too important not to get started.
If we go past our goal the total of the funds will determine how they will be allocated. If there is enough to reopen the bakery then we can get started with that project directly. If there is more then we can put more money directly into purchase of medications.
If there is extra funding but not enough to start this effort we will put funds into other existing local aid we are working with. This way the aid reaches the people it needs to.

<p>This film started four years ago, approximately three days after I mustered up the courage to Google “anorexia” for the first time. I had been diagnosed with the illness four years prior, but the name alone carried with it the secrecy and fear that clouded my ability to see the societal significance of my story. <b>I had no idea I was one of millions.</b> Or that getting proper help is hard for nearly everyone with an eating disorder. Or that there are people actively trying to change all of that at the federal level, driven by their own brushes with death or loss of loved ones.</p>
<p>The fear turned into a responsibility I couldn’t walk away from as the magnitude of this story unfolded. <b>Why was no one talking about this?</b></p>
<p>I no longer viewed my experience with anorexia as a traumatizing experience from my past, but as a filmmaker with an important story to tell.</p>
<p>By replacing the ill-informed idea that eating disorders exist solely on the covers of fashion magazines with the pressing issues of insurance denials and federal oversight, the way we talk about them will change. <b>No other film has done this.</b></p>

<p><i>Just Eat  </i>illuminates a story untold. Pioneers in the field of eating disorder research tell us what the science says, including the link between brain and behavior using genetics and brain imaging.

Just Eat  illuminates a story untold. Pioneers in the field of eating disorder research tell us what the science says, including the link between brain and behavior using genetics and brain imaging. One of the few lawyers in the country who exclusively takes on eating disorder cases tells us of the battle against the insurance companies that deny treatment coverage. The Director of the National Institute for Mental Health and members of Congress discuss how eating disorders rank on a federal level, while we see hundreds of individuals from across the country lobby on Capitol Hill every six months for a change in policy.

Our notable panel of experts tell us why the story is important, but the main characters of this film are the ones living  this story. This is what we still need to film. The audience will enter the mind of someone fighting their disease, while following their external fight for treatment, support, and recognition in spite of stereotypes. 


This film has been entirely independently funded up to this point. A wealth of talented, generous, and passionate friends have made this film what it is right now, but in order to resume filming at the standard of quality it needs we need your support.
Your money will help take us through the last few months of shooting. Travel expenses, gear rentals, talented people to operate that gear, not to mention random necessities like batteries, hard drives, fanny packs, etc.
Here’s how our costs break down:

 






You, my friends, get some seriously cool stuff for donating. Check out just a few of our featured perks below.


Not pictured: The satisfaction that comes from donating and our deep gratitude.   






There has been no other film that addresses eating disorders in this way. We all have a chance at contributing to something pretty great: A new conversation about eating disorders and about those who have them.
Being honest, open, and pragmatic about them lessens the power they have over those they control, and puts an end to the hushed stigmatization that prevents people from getting the life-saving help they need.
That’s what this film will do. It opens the door for new discourse. It opens the door for change. We invite you to be a part of that.
Once the film is [gasp!] completed, we will take this conversation to the public by entering it into various film festivals and a coordinated tour of US college campuses.
We really believe this is just the beginning.
Laura has worked in the journalism and film production world for over six years. She brings a firm commitment to journalistic integrity and as much objectivity is allowed of her. She served as co-producer and lead writer on the feature documentary Out of Respect in 2009, has since gone on to work for Al Jazeera English, Discovery, NBC, and National Geographic, and is a producer of The Myken Project documentary, currently in production. This is her first feature film.



Documentaries are unpredictable by nature. You often cannot control the circumstances any better than you can control the lives you are documenting.

Realistic challenges include the likelihood of needing more funding later in the production process. This campaign will without doubt kickstart us into our final filming phase, which will take us one step closer to the film’s completion.
One primary challenge we are facing is the subject nature itself. The individuals we are following, currently battling their eating disorder, will have a support system in place during the filming process. We will be keenly cautious of any negative effect the camera may have on their well-being, while at the same time prepare ourselves to show the rawness of their mental state.
One thing we are certain of: The film will be completed. No matter what. 
We are prepared to raise the additional funds necessary once we enter the post-production and distribution phases, and will be sure to keep our backers updated every step of the way.


We completely understand that making a monetary donation may not be an option for some people. THAT'S OKAY. You can very much still be a part of this process and support Just Eat by sharing it to anyone and everyone who will listen. Facebook. Twitter. Tumblr. Tinder (maybe?). Google+. The water cooler. 
In fact, IndieGoGo makes this very easy with their share tools!

The primary focus is a centre of excellence, with far reaching benefits to the community and other parts of the world. As an independent facility we remain focused on our core philosophies, principles and beliefs - without the interference of external factors such as politics or local Government . In today's economic environment we have to rely on our creativity to be unique and successful in our business approach, hence the opportunity I have pleasure presenting to you.<br/><br/>
<p><b>The Story - Introduction by Deane Thomas</b><br/></p><p>I would like to tell
you why I feel so passionate about the lighthouse project and how, together, we
can transform lives, not only here in Vukovar, but also throughout the world.</p>
<p>I first came to
Vukovar in 1998 with my family – I saw with my own eyes the after effects of an
armed conflict – I saw an iconic building as an opportunity - a positive change
can be made, by adding some creativity and western influence to a torn culture.</p>
<p>The building was once a
regional place to be, a beacon serving the whole area – its’ atmosphere was
buzzing with celebrations and commemorations – it was the heart of the town.</p>
<p>When I returned here
to live last year I wondered why!! What is the purpose of me being here!<span>  Then through my own personal healing and
growth I began to recall my original visions from 1998.</span></p>
<p>I decided that
something can be done and knew how together, we can make that change. As
entrepreneurs, visionaries, pioneers or as individuals – We are strong enough
to effect the changes needed – this is because we have lived our lives with
open minds and hearts, with visions and dreams, ideals and feelings.</p>
<p>We can transform this
Iconic building into a wonderful venue – one which will cater for the needs of
the community at a grass roots level, where we will capture the hearts and
souls of generations of people, especially the younger ones who are so
unnecessarily affected by the travesty that occurred here in 1991 – they have
an image that they have no responsibility for or to accept - it is our role to
change this here and now. </p>
<p>By using new methods
of teaching, we will change these innocent lives; we will capture their hearts
and souls before they enter society; these techniques will include meditation,
yoga, healthy eating, honesty, truth and self-confidence – these children will
possess a much healthier outlook than at present.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433773911/vfdiajmcr0uqieszqyqn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 445.333px; height: 334px;""/></p><br/>
<p>We will help those
that suffer daily from the consequences of armed conflict; by offering
comprehensive ways of coming to terms and coping with living their lives in the
here and now. They will have valuable one on one counselling as well as group
activities – we shall also offer services such as alcohol and drug abuse
sessions for those that need it.</p>
<p>We will cater to
foreign students and teachers who will learn our valuable work directly in the
field – they will then return home to share and apply this knowledge in their
own communities, The transfer of healing and knowledge is at the core of this
program, together we will monitor and collect valuable data and witness the
success of our work at home and abroad.</p>
<p>In addition to this
vision, as an independent operator we have to ensure the complex is a
self-sufficient business unit.<span>  Therefore
we will include a private English school and kindergarten, 40 bed hostel,
conference facilities, leisure and well-being centre, restaurant and
entertainment area. </span></p>
<p>We will truly be
helping others to grow and learn - which in turn empowers them to live a
balanced healthy life.</p>
<p>Together we can make a
contribution, however large or small.</p>
<p>I ask you to<span>  join me in lighting the first beacon in our
lighthouse, and allow it to shine and spread its’ light all over the world.</span></p>

The purchase price of the building is approx 2m Euro (in local currency) - Banks will support us once we have secured the property by granting mortgages  with grace periods up to 10 years, also renovation funds and working capital requirements, there are also EU funds which will made available for the renovation and works required. We shall also offer concessions to corporate investors (such as the gaming area, leisure complex and restaurant) we shall also sell or lease the private accommodation built into the project, this will add to the funding pool available for the project.</p><p><b>The Vision</b> <br/></p><p>To give Vukovar and its surrounding community a new heart so
 that it may grow and live through our offer of healing, wellness and therapy. We shall also educate the younger generations who are not responsible for what has happened.  They are already suffering from the 
actions of generations who are tolerant towards racism, nationalism and alcoholism.<br/></p><p><b>The Mission</b></p><p>One of the missions to heal and offer a safe place for victims of Post Traumatic Stress  (1991/2 conflict), to teach in the community social awareness and skills to assist victims, as well as offer suitable solutions to change their way of thinking. <br/></p><p>To establish programs for children of all ages, promoting wellness, healthy and spiritual ways of life, to include yoga, meditation and honesty, there is lots of research that demonstrates how children of all ages are being absorbed<br/>into a very virtual society, there are far too many adverse activities the younger generations indulge in that pre-occupy their ability to actually experience and feel life.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432569228/d4eedtcisupwdmu34odd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>A local based charity, <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/cfwwpap/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Coalition for Work With Psycho-trauma and Peace </a>(CWWPP)is working for the empowerment of people during or after armed conflict or with the potential for such conflict to take control of their own lives, particularly at grass roots level. We will offer them facilities and resources to enable an international centre of excellence where we shall teach foreign students how to assist in their communities around the world, especially in war torn areas in every continent. They have agreed in principal to accept our offer.<br/><br/><p>We shall also be working with an established English language school from the region and/or overseas - the view to open a private school on one of the floors; our research shows there is a need for such a school. The syllabus will be based on Cambridge system and meet the necessary local legal requirements, There is no such offering within 250km of our location, but there are 2 large cities in close vicinity with populations and financial capacity to provide up to 75 students. We shall also open an English language kindergarten for children up to the age of 6<br/>years old, covering English syllabus.  Parents will have a choice on where best to educate their children, something very new and futuristic for the local community.<br/></p><p><b>The Property</b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""387"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F127817664&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F127817664&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F518725273_640.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>The building is currently empty and being allowed to go into a state of disrepair. The former accommodation area is ready for reconstruction (all interior walls have been removed)- the original project of the current owners was being funded partly with European Union funds (some 2.5m Euro allocated)to convert it to a 4* hotel and leisure complex. The town already is home to a 4* hotel, whilst there is a requirement for rooms in the area, we feel the occupation rates will be much higher by offering essential and basic needs for the current necessity, with the<br/><p>ability to adapt and change the building in the future to cater for busy periods and events held locally.</p><p></p><p><b>Plan for the current building </b>-</p><p>The Building itself has 8 floors and a basement - the current market 
valuation in its present state is approx 5m Euro - with an estimated 
value of post renovation of up to 6.3m Euro. The objective is to have 
the facility fully functional by Summer 2016, to enable us to attract 
students to the English school for Autumn 2016. We are able to open the 
building in stages and dependent on financial capacity we can begin 
works as early as September 2015, with ground floor operational at the 
end of 2015, with the first 2 floors of accommodation completed and 
operational in January 2016.</p><p>Basement
 - Sports bar and gaming area (yes probably a casino or sports betting 
area)we shall probably lease to an established operator who will provide
 an exclusive area for guests to enjoy,  We have approached interested 
parties and will continue to negotiate a suitable agreement once the 
building is secured.  Alternative uses for this area are being considered.<br/></p><p>First floor - entrance to basement area -
 small reception area - right side a selection of boutiques and small 
offices for lease to local companies. Entrance to main lobby and hotel 
area leading to back of property where we shall reconstruct the 
restaurant and bar areas, in a modern but culturally sensitive feel - 
adopting old and new interior designs where we can - extending out to 
terraces overlooking the River Danube and the footpaths leading form the
 property - the kitchens and restaurant will be catering for the 
businesses of the area and offer 4-5* cuisine - the kitchen will also 
prepare meals for the student areas, as well as outside catering for 
events in the area.</p><p>Second and third floors - to create low cost 
reasonable accommodation approx 20 double beds and 40 single beds (in 
bunk bed hostel style)- these can be taken up during the week days by 
students in the town and facility, and weekends by visitors to the town.
 The idea is not to compete with the 4* hotel -  there will also be a 
student communal area where we shall serve meals as part of their 
arrangements!</p><p>Fourth floor - to be used for the community 
activities that will offer meditation, yoga and other well being classes
 for all ages, as well as an area where local artists and writers can 
come and sit in peace and gain inspiration - this area can be converted 
into dormitory type sleeping spaces for use when there are major events 
in the town (and there are many of them)at the time of writing there is 
also a requirement to sleep 100 children twice per week in the town yet 
there is no space for them<br/>anywhere - we will aim to fill the gap.</p><p>Fifth
 floor- conference facilities and office spaces for the international 
charity that has agreed in principle to the project involvement (CWWPP)-
 they have been present in the town since the end of the conflict and 
offer free support, and assistance to PTS victims as well as other 
necessary (alcoholism, abuse, trauma etc), they work extensively in the 
community and teach others to help others - this facility will enable 
them to offer walk in services, in house studies and many other<br/>wonderful
 opportunities to expand their field of work to other countries. 
International conferences will be hosted in the facility, and will house
 state of the art technology to allow live streaming around the world.</p><p>Sixth
 Floor - International School and Kindergarten - English Language and 
Syllabus - I have approached 2 English schools with a view to 
cooperation, instead of us trying to reinvent the wheel we should offer 
their program - it is up to us to find the students, there is no such 
school within 250km of the town, and there is a demand for private 
English education in the region. We will attract students from Bosnia, 
Croatia and Serbia as all borders are very close - for older students we
 can offer accommodation also.</p><p>Seventh and attic floors - Private accommodation 3 apartments which will be sold or leased.</p><b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433772647/ku9oyikn2imngzvj0okv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Within the complex there is a plan to build an extra new area which will
 include a small swimming pool, saunas and gymnasium -this new space 
will be constructed above the existing kitchen area at the rear of the 
hotel. the outlook will be the River Danube.  I shall discuss with 
architects the feasibility of making a roof top terrace and garden, so 
we can create an amazing outlook across the whole region and incorporate
 the beauty and nature into our wonderful venue.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>Current Position</b><br/></p><p></p>There have been discussions with bankers, at this time they need to involve head offices  due to the scale of the project - this process is likely to take some 6 weeks for them to complete their assessment and due diligence process.  We are aware of other bankers that have a keen interest in supporting a project of this nature therefore we can negotiate discounts on finance and/or sponsorship deals to promote them in the community (this is much easier once we are a client and have the asset), as this town is really a symbol of the Country and region.  <br/><br/>A team of local lawyers has agreed to work for free on the project, they can sense the value and importance this vision brings to the community.  Others in the community have committed to assist once we have secured the premises. <br/><br/>Once we secure the building I will be embarking on a national campaign 
to promote the project and secure additional sponsorship with socially 
conscious corporates, and sports ambassadors from all over the Balkans.<br/><br/>On acquisition of the building we shall be eligible to apply for EU 
funds - the current owner has been awarded 2.2m Euro from the central 
fund for the reconstruction and development -  there are other funds 
available for this project and will be meeting with the representatives 
from regional offices in due course I expect that we shall be eligible 
for up to 3m Euro in non-returnable grant funding - in addition to this 
we will also receive funding for creation of jobs in the town - the 
project will create 50-60 working places.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433774343/lx0eb1m7l7dlljpprl0u.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>It would be very fitting for the President of Croatia to officially open and/or endorse this project in November 2016, this will be the 25th Anniversary of the fall of Vukovar - whilst this day is one of remembrance, it shall also be used a day to demonstrate to the ""City of Heroes""  there is a new beacon shining, that is here to guide and help them in times of need - a true lighthouse.  I will seek guidance on who is the most appropriate statesman to officially open the venue - it may be more appropriate to invite a group of International sports and health ambassadors to celebrate a new beginning.<br/></p><p></p><p>This project is evolving on a daily basis, I will post updates, I have created a closed group face book page which gives more details and pictures, please contact me for access.</p><p><b>Additional Help Needed</b> - Please share this vision with people you fell will appreciate it and can offer assistance in any way - I am not a magician - I need volunteers to join the existing ones who are helping already - architects - publicists, philanthropists, NGO's, entrepreneurs and anyone who is willing to help.  Please direct emails to lighthouseproject@tdcgroup.ru<br/></p><p> <br/>I am grateful for your time and input – and look forward to a successful project!</p><p><br/>History of Vukovar from - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vukovar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia </a></p><p>Official town website - <a href=""http://www.vukovar.hr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.vukovar.hr</a></p><p>International Airport (30km) Osijek (OSI) - <a href=""http://www.osijek-airport.hr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.osijek-airport.hr</a></p><p><br/></p></div>","Lighthouse Project - To renovate a former iconic building into a multi-purpose centre for entertainment, education and healing.

and souls before they enter society; these techniques will include meditation,
yoga, healthy eating, honesty, truth and self-confidence – these children will
possess a much healthier outlook than at present.
We will help those
that suffer daily from the consequences of armed conflict; by offering
comprehensive ways of coming to terms and coping with living their lives in the
here and now. They will have valuable one on one counselling as well as group
activities – we shall also offer services such as alcohol and drug abuse
sessions for those that need it.
We will cater to
foreign students and teachers who will learn our valuable work directly in the
field – they will then return home to share and apply this knowledge in their
own communities, The transfer of healing and knowledge is at the core of this
program, together we will monitor and collect valuable data and witness the
success of our work at home and abroad.
In addition to this
vision, as an independent operator we have to ensure the complex is a
self-sufficient business unit.  Therefore
we will include a private English school and kindergarten, 40 bed hostel,
conference facilities, leisure and well-being centre, restaurant and
entertainment area. 
We will truly be
helping others to grow and learn - which in turn empowers them to live a
balanced healthy life.
Together we can make a
contribution, however large or small.
I ask you to  join me in lighting the first beacon in our
lighthouse, and allow it to shine and spread its’ light all over the world.
Thank you Introduction above in other languages  Russian French Spanish CroatianWhy do we need crowd funding?We need to secure the property, our aim is to raise as much of the purchase price through crowd funding - we can access business finance but it is limited for a new start project, therefore we feel crowd funding is the best means in which to assist us to achieve the initial financial requirements for the project. The purchase price of the building is approx 2m Euro (in local currency) - Banks will support us once we have secured the property by granting mortgages  with grace periods up to 10 years, also renovation funds and working capital requirements, there are also EU funds which will made available for the renovation and works required. We shall also offer concessions to corporate investors (such as the gaming area, leisure complex and restaurant) we shall also sell or lease the private accommodation built into the project, this will add to the funding pool available for the project.The Vision To give Vukovar and its surrounding community a new heart so
 that it may grow and live through our offer of healing, wellness and therapy. We shall also educate the younger generations who are not responsible for what has happened.  They are already suffering from the 
actions of generations who are tolerant towards racism, nationalism and alcoholism.The MissionOne of the missions to heal and offer a safe place for victims of Post Traumatic Stress  (1991/2 conflict), to teach in the community social awareness and skills to assist victims, as well as offer suitable solutions to change their way of thinking. To establish programs for children of all ages, promoting wellness, healthy and spiritual ways of life, to include yoga, meditation and honesty, there is lots of research that demonstrates how children of all ages are being absorbedinto a very virtual society, there are far too many adverse activities the younger generations indulge in that pre-occupy their ability to actually experience and feel life.A local based charity, The Coalition for Work With Psycho-trauma and Peace (CWWPP)is working for the empowerment of people during or after armed conflict or with the potential for such conflict to take control of their own lives, particularly at grass roots level. We will offer them facilities and resources to enable an international centre of excellence where we shall teach foreign students how to assist in their communities around the world, especially in war torn areas in every continent. They have agreed in principal to accept our offer.We shall also be working with an established English language school from the region and/or overseas - the view to open a private school on one of the floors; our research shows there is a need for such a school. The syllabus will be based on Cambridge system and meet the necessary local legal requirements, There is no such offering within 250km of our location, but there are 2 large cities in close vicinity with populations and financial capacity to provide up to 75 students. We shall also open an English language kindergarten for children up to the age of 6years old, covering English syllabus.  Parents will have a choice on where best to educate their children, something very new and futuristic for the local community.The PropertyThe building is currently empty and being allowed to go into a state of disrepair. The former accommodation area is ready for reconstruction (all interior walls have been removed)- the original project of the current owners was being funded partly with European Union funds (some 2.5m Euro allocated)to convert it to a 4* hotel and leisure complex. The town already is home to a 4* hotel, whilst there is a requirement for rooms in the area, we feel the occupation rates will be much higher by offering essential and basic needs for the current necessity, with theability to adapt and change the building in the future to cater for busy periods and events held locally.Plan for the current building -The Building itself has 8 floors and a basement - the current market 
valuation in its present state is approx 5m Euro - with an estimated 
value of post renovation of up to 6.3m Euro. The objective is to have 
the facility fully functional by Summer 2016, to enable us to attract 
students to the English school for Autumn 2016. We are able to open the 
building in stages and dependent on financial capacity we can begin 
works as early as September 2015, with ground floor operational at the 
end of 2015, with the first 2 floors of accommodation completed and 
operational in January 2016.Basement
 - Sports bar and gaming area (yes probably a casino or sports betting 
area)we shall probably lease to an established operator who will provide
 an exclusive area for guests to enjoy,  We have approached interested 
parties and will continue to negotiate a suitable agreement once the 
building is secured.  Alternative uses for this area are being considered.First floor - entrance to basement area -
 small reception area - right side a selection of boutiques and small 
offices for lease to local companies. Entrance to main lobby and hotel 
area leading to back of property where we shall reconstruct the 
restaurant and bar areas, in a modern but culturally sensitive feel - 
adopting old and new interior designs where we can - extending out to 
terraces overlooking the River Danube and the footpaths leading form the
 property - the kitchens and restaurant will be catering for the 
businesses of the area and offer 4-5* cuisine - the kitchen will also 
prepare meals for the student areas, as well as outside catering for 
events in the area.Second and third floors - to create low cost 
reasonable accommodation approx 20 double beds and 40 single beds (in 
bunk bed hostel style)- these can be taken up during the week days by 
students in the town and facility, and weekends by visitors to the town.
 The idea is not to compete with the 4* hotel -  there will also be a 
student communal area where we shall serve meals as part of their 
arrangements!Fourth floor - to be used for the community 
activities that will offer meditation, yoga and other well being classes
 for all ages, as well as an area where local artists and writers can 
come and sit in peace and gain inspiration - this area can be converted 
into dormitory type sleeping spaces for use when there are major events 
in the town (and there are many of them)at the time of writing there is 
also a requirement to sleep 100 children twice per week in the town yet 
there is no space for themanywhere - we will aim to fill the gap.Fifth
 floor- conference facilities and office spaces for the international 
charity that has agreed in principle to the project involvement (CWWPP)-
 they have been present in the town since the end of the conflict and 
offer free support, and assistance to PTS victims as well as other 
necessary (alcoholism, abuse, trauma etc), they work extensively in the 
community and teach others to help others - this facility will enable 
them to offer walk in services, in house studies and many otherwonderful
 opportunities to expand their field of work to other countries. 
International conferences will be hosted in the facility, and will house
 state of the art technology to allow live streaming around the world.Sixth
 Floor - International School and Kindergarten - English Language and 
Syllabus - I have approached 2 English schools with a view to 
cooperation, instead of us trying to reinvent the wheel we should offer 
their program - it is up to us to find the students, there is no such 
school within 250km of the town, and there is a demand for private 
English education in the region. We will attract students from Bosnia, 
Croatia and Serbia as all borders are very close - for older students we
 can offer accommodation also.Seventh and attic floors - Private accommodation 3 apartments which will be sold or leased.Within the complex there is a plan to build an extra new area which will
 include a small swimming pool, saunas and gymnasium -this new space 
will be constructed above the existing kitchen area at the rear of the 
hotel. the outlook will be the River Danube.  I shall discuss with 
architects the feasibility of making a roof top terrace and garden, so 
we can create an amazing outlook across the whole region and incorporate
 the beauty and nature into our wonderful venue.Current PositionThere have been discussions with bankers, at this time they need to involve head offices  due to the scale of the project - this process is likely to take some 6 weeks for them to complete their assessment and due diligence process.  We are aware of other bankers that have a keen interest in supporting a project of this nature therefore we can negotiate discounts on finance and/or sponsorship deals to promote them in the community (this is much easier once we are a client and have the asset), as this town is really a symbol of the Country and region.  A team of local lawyers has agreed to work for free on the project, they can sense the value and importance this vision brings to the community.  Others in the community have committed to assist once we have secured the premises. Once we secure the building I will be embarking on a national campaign 
to promote the project and secure additional sponsorship with socially 
conscious corporates, and sports ambassadors from all over the Balkans.On acquisition of the building we shall be eligible to apply for EU 
funds - the current owner has been awarded 2.2m Euro from the central 
fund for the reconstruction and development -  there are other funds 
available for this project and will be meeting with the representatives 
from regional offices in due course I expect that we shall be eligible 
for up to 3m Euro in non-returnable grant funding - in addition to this 
we will also receive funding for creation of jobs in the town - the 
project will create 50-60 working places.It would be very fitting for the President of Croatia to officially open and/or endorse this project in November 2016, this will be the 25th Anniversary of the fall of Vukovar - whilst this day is one of remembrance, it shall also be used a day to demonstrate to the ""City of Heroes""  there is a new beacon shining, that is here to guide and help them in times of need - a true lighthouse.  I will seek guidance on who is the most appropriate statesman to officially open the venue - it may be more appropriate to invite a group of International sports and health ambassadors to celebrate a new beginning.This project is evolving on a daily basis, I will post updates, I have created a closed group face book page which gives more details and pictures, please contact me for access.Additional Help Needed - Please share this vision with people you fell will appreciate it and can offer assistance in any way - I am not a magician - I need volunteers to join the existing ones who are helping already - architects - publicists, philanthropists, NGO's, entrepreneurs and anyone who is willing to help.  Please direct emails to lighthouseproject@tdcgroup.ru I am grateful for your time and input – and look forward to a successful project!History of Vukovar from - Wikipedia Official town website - www.vukovar.hrInternational Airport (30km) Osijek (OSI) - http://www.osijek-airport.hr",6.0,1,"4 Campaigns

In attempt to reclaim a sense of power, she steals from the kids bullying her but shamefully hides the items in her closet. Stakes are raised when Amelia becomes reckless.  When she gets caught red-handed, she is forced to confront the hidden items in her closet and find true sense of empowerment.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Amelia's Closet</i> is a touching story about confronting truths about oneself, empowerment, and perseverance. It's our hope that we can bring attention to this project because the message is about empowerment, specifically for kids who may feel alone or are experiencing bullying </span>from their peers.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Amelia’s Closet is a coming of age story about an 11-year-old girl from a low income background who lives with her hard working single father.  At school, she is heavily bullied and often left feeling powerless. In attempt to reclaim a sense of power, she steals from the kids bullying her but shamefully hides the items in her closet. Stakes are raised when Amelia becomes reckless.  When she gets caught red-handed, she is forced to confront the hidden items in her closet and find true sense of empowerment.  
Amelia's Closet is a touching story about confronting truths about oneself, empowerment, and perseverance. It's our hope that we can bring attention to this project because the message is about empowerment, specifically for kids who may feel alone or are experiencing bullying from their peers.

Our DreamFifteen years ago, Melissa and I joined my mother and father on this 52 acre piece of land called “A Place for the Heart”, and launched a one week creative worship camp for high schoolers.



We wanted to create a place for them to encounter the freedom of the gospel of Jesus. This one-week camp grew into a two-month school, which grew into an extended internship, which then became a six-month second phase of the school. 


Along the way, as we have grown, we’ve intentionally kept our schools smaller, and more intimate in nature. Our desire is to be face to face with the students that come, to sit and eat at a table together, and pour into their lives in a personal way.


Today, we host Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the 18 Inch Journey, internships, and retreats, and have a full time staff running the schools with us every year.  What was a small seed, the dream of God for this land, has fully blossomed.

Our Vision
My father started this ministry on a principle from Mother Theresa, “If you wait till you have what you think you need to do ministry, you’ll never do ministry.” God used the stick that was in Moses’ hand to deliver Israel from Egypt. We have used everything in our hands to host our first worship camp and many 18 Inch Journey schools since.  Over the past eight years, we’ve expanded, remodeled, and rearranged our buildings in every way imaginable to host our schools and retreats. We’ve turned barns into apartments and sheds into studios. With the expansion of our discipleship schools and internships, we simply need more space. We have maxed out the capacity of our facilities. Now we need your help to expand our housing for the dream to continue to grow.



Our History
Since 2008:
Seven 18 Inch Journey schools
Students coming from 27 states and 15 countries
Total of 137 students who have been radically changed by the love of Jesus!

 


Our NeedWe believe one bunk can change the world. More cabins means more bunks. More bunks means more hearts. And each heart that encounters the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit will never be the same. Marriages, families, culture, cities, and nations will be blessed and impacted by the DNA of the sons and daughters who come to this land, setting apart a season to be with God, and family. Help us change the world by investing in this dream.

Our goal is to build three new cabins for student housing. Each of these cabins cost around $50,000 so we need to raise $150,000.  



$50,000 we can build One cabin


$100,000 we can build Two cabins


$150,000 we can build Three cabins.



Our plan is to break ground in May, and have these cabins built before the start of our next 18 Inch Journey School in the Fall. The $150,000 goal is our first step toward a much larger vision for these 52 acres of land. In the last year we have designed a layout for the property with buildings, studios, classrooms, and cabins that stretch out across these beautiful rolling hills.

</div>","The Rahway International Film Festival was first held in June of 2013 in an effort to create a warm and welcoming home for independent filmmakers and fans of film in the Tri-State Area. We annually showcase short films, and now feature films in competition and music videos throughout the day while offering networking and workshop opportunities to those interested in the film industry.
What makes us unique?
Our Mission:Our mission is to provide an opportunity for artists worldwide to showcase works that educate, and inspire equality, empathy and awareness through film.Our Vision:We believe that film can reach the mind and soul in ways nothing else can. For this reason, we present films that strive to promote equality, champion the oppressed and promote open-mindedness.In keeping with equality, we seek to present an equal ratio of films created by male and female filmmakers from around the world.
Rahway International Film Festival is returning for its third year and expanding to a 3-day event!
We do our best to select intriguing, thoughtful, and entertaining films.  We want you to be riveted-- like these folks!We offer seminars and talk backs from extremely talented filmmakers.  They are both informative and enjoyable!  
     Our Networking Events have proven to be quite lucrative over the past few years.  You can meet filmmakers, writers, actors, and more - all while enjoying a delicious catered meal and a cash bar!We've Got Some Pretty Cool Supporters too!This year we would like to do all of the above plus MORE over the course of 3 days!

    The Impact  This Project is deeply personal to me so I am very humbled and excited to move closer to sharing it with the world. These contributions will get us so much closer to making this happen.    
Challenges
 As with any entertainment Project we could get stuck on the way to making it happen even if we reach our goals with this Campaign. I do believe because of my many years in the industry on an international level and with the many contacts and friends I picked up on the way, that we have a very good plan in place to be able to overcome most if not all possible obstacles and be successful in reaching our final goal  and be able to bring this Project to the masses.   Other Ways You Can Help  If you cant contribute at this time, please help us by getting the word out and make some noise about this campaign.
