<h2>Now you can stay cool with Solar</h2>
<hr style=""border-top:1px solid #e5e5e5;""/>
<p>Whether it’s camping, bbq, fishing, or just relaxing in the Sun, we love the outdoors.  Nothing kills the trip like rotten food, soggy bread, or warm beer. To keep the adventure going, we minimized space needed for ice and fuel and maximized space for fresh food, cold drinks, and fun times. GoSun Chill is like having <strong>a fridge on wheels.​</strong></p>

<h2>Same size, more space.</h2>
<hr style=""border-top:1px solid #e5e5e5;""/>
<p>The savings are immediate, no more wasting time on melting ice.  Without ice you can use 100% of the cooler's volume. <strong> </strong>GoSun Chill has nearly <strong>double the room</strong> for food and drinks when compared with coolers of equal dimensions. </p>

<p>GoSun Chill weighs 28 LBS (12.7kg), fits 1.4 cubic feet (40 Liters) and stands 24"" x 16"" x 19"" inches (60 x 40 x 48 cm).  For comparison, a ""45 Liter"" Yeti Tundra cooler holds just 28 beers and weighs 23 LBS before needing about 20 LBS of ice. </p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<hr style=""border-top:1px solid #e5e5e5;""/>
<p>GoSun designs products to make your outdoor life more accessible and independent. We combined <strong>solar power technology with innovative engineering and design</strong> to give you incredible long-lasting, versatile products.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557192330/xx4uxm4cxiojnugdywkw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our breakthrough vacuum solar ovens cook food like never before - no mess, no fuss, no fuel. They are already making ripples of change and expanding cooking possibilities as reliable, portable, easy stoves.</p>
<p>The GoSun Chill builds off the same innovations and cools your goods <strong>completely ice-free</strong> and <strong>off-the-grid. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/onbmdsj013dovwa/CoolerSpin_V03.gif?dl=0"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Using solar and energy transfer technology, GoSun Chill uses one third the energy of typical portable fridges. The Chill applies an all-electric brushless DC compressor instead of the more commonly used thermo-electric coolers - which are terribly inefficient.</p>
<p>Our efficient brushless DC compressor draws only 40 watts of power - letting it keep your goods cool without using too much energy. Because it’s not thermoelectric, GoSun is also <strong>completely quiet, fully controllable and extremely durable.</strong></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Features that matter</h2>
<hr style=""border-top:1px solid #e5e5e5;""/>
<p>Not just a box that carries ice, the GoSun Chill comes with everything you'll need for long-term chilling.  A deeper look into the features reveals the perfect blend of form and function, a signature of GoSun Design.</p>

<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>

<p>This is our sixth crowdfunding campaign and there is always some risk (and plenty of challenge :) to building cutting edge technology.  Experience tells us to remain open with our backers and provide realistic expectations when getting through production and logistics.  Our estimated production timeline for the Chill provides a delivery schedule assuming things go as planned.  Any bumps or bruises along the path are typically absorbed by GoSun, so you can sit back and chill. </p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","5-Time Creator of Crowdfunded Solar ProductsGoSun is leading the fuel-free frontier, utilizing the best in clean tech to help you USE MORE SUN.  We love being outdoors, sharing cold drinks and hot meals, but we don't love the mess and logistics that come with ice or fire.  Never waste your time or money on ice again.As seen in  Coolers are a pain in the ICE...This is the best way to make sure your investment in food is safe.  No more worries about crushing and freezing the food that's touching the ice or having to organize the sandwiches so they aren't drenched by the time you get there.  Food always looks good going in, but not so good when it comes time to eat it. Fashion Coolers BewareSticky, spoiled, stinky... $400 over-built coolers may fend off grizzly bears, but they still rely on ice that's heavy, takes up space and leaves everything soggy.  We haven't found a cooler yet that drives to the store to buy more ice.  
 
Now you can stay cool with Solar

Whether it’s camping, bbq, fishing, or just relaxing in the Sun, we love the outdoors.  Nothing kills the trip like rotten food, soggy bread, or warm beer. To keep the adventure going, we minimized space needed for ice and fuel and maximized space for fresh food, cold drinks, and fun times. GoSun Chill is like having a fridge on wheels.​

 
The Era for Solar Living has arrived

It's the age of innovation, yet we are still fighting against the Sun to keep things cold.  Now, we have the ability to harness its power more efficiently than ever, taking melting ice out of the equation.  GoSun engineered a cooler that can keep colder temperatures longer and is more sanitary than anything else on the market.  Nothing is cleaner or easier than GoSun Chill.  
It's time to go solar.

 
Multi-Modal Power, means you've got optionsGoSun Chill can be powered by multiple power sources, including: Powerbank, AC Adapter, 12 Volt Cord (car port charger), Solar Table, or Flexible Solar Panels. This way, you can access the most convenient power sources when you need it. To charge the Powerbank, plug in the included AC Adapter into any wall socket (100-250VAC) or use one of our two solar charging options - the Solar Table or Flexible Solar Panel. Power to make ice and keep everyone chargedEvery GoSun Chill comes with a detachable, lithium polymer Powerbank, providing a day's worth of ice.  Not a little phone charger, the Powerbank outputs 12 volts at up to 15 amps and can supply the average phone over 10 full charges. Only two pounds (one kilo), it features 3 USB ports and a 200 lumen light.You've never seen a cooler like this!  We included all the essentials, and more: 
144wh Detachable Powerbank to use even when you don't need the Chill
Accessory Storage Pouches to keep small items handy
Tie-Down Cleats and Straps for carrying a large load
Wheels and Handles to traverse nearly any terrain
Emergency Drain in case you ever run out of power and need to use ice
Bottle Opener to open drinks
One-Year No-Questions Warranty
 How long will your Powerbank run?Use the PowerBank when you're going afar, but the Chill comes with AC/DC compatibility so you have lots of power options.  Pull out the solar panels to keep your Powerbank charged while it runs the cooler all day long (or all week long) off-grid.During a typical summer day (i.e. storing camp food and drinks), the Powerbank will keep everything cool for 14 hours on an 80°F (27°C) day.  If you're making ice, the compressor runs full-time, which can drain the Powerbank in 3-5 hours.It is often easier to power the Chill from the 12 V cigarette port on a Car, Boat or RV.   Keep your food cold on the drive to the beach or camping and then switch to the Powerbank to run the Chill around the campfire. GoSun is also there when you need itGoods stay fresh and safe much longer in dry, ice-free environments. If you want to plug your Chill into an AC wall socket or 12V car port, your wires and adapters are always aboard the cooler, tucked into the two storage pouches. As an added bonus, the Powerbank detaches from the Chill to give you energy where you need it. Stores anything at the right temperatureCoolers full of melting ice are oblivious to what's inside.  The GoSun Chill gives you complete temperature control from -4°F to 68°F (-20°C to 20°C).  Having a fridge/freezer gives your precious cargo a much longer lifespan by taking melting water out of the equation.You can store... Hear from GoSun's Founder In this video, Patrick Sherwin, shares his impression and how he best utilizes this portable, off-grid refrigerator.  With 200 Watts of solar on top of the RV and a GoSun Fusion, he never runs to generator. 

 
Support our Mission

  
 
Spread our Story

     
Same size, more space.

The savings are immediate, no more wasting time on melting ice.  Without ice you can use 100% of the cooler's volume.  GoSun Chill has nearly double the room for food and drinks when compared with coolers of equal dimensions. 

 

GoSun Chill weighs 28 LBS (12.7kg), fits 1.4 cubic feet (40 Liters) and stands 24"" x 16"" x 19"" inches (60 x 40 x 48 cm).  For comparison, a ""45 Liter"" Yeti Tundra cooler holds just 28 beers and weighs 23 LBS before needing about 20 LBS of ice. 
 
How the Chill Compares
Among portable fridges, there is nothing that gets close to the Chill.  At half the price, GoSun's complete solar powered cooler is more accessible, plus it's compatible with the complete off-grid kitchen.

 
Together Under the Sun. No Ice. No Fuel.

These four GoSun products are all you need for a complete outdoor kitchen. 

Cool and store your goods with the Chill
Cook amazing meals using the hybrid solar and electric GoSun Fusion

Charge the Cooler, Fusion or Devices with the Powerbank
Recharge the Powerbank and relax with the Solar Table or Flexible Solar Panel.


 
GoSun Fusion is the latest and greatest in our line of breakthrough vacuum tube solar ovens.  A hybrid, the Fusion runs on direct sunlight during the day or 12 V during the night or bad weather.  The Fusion's electric heating element runs off the PowerBank through the same power cord as the GoSun Chill. 

 
How it works

GoSun designs products to make your outdoor life more accessible and independent. We combined solar power technology with innovative engineering and design to give you incredible long-lasting, versatile products.

Our breakthrough vacuum solar ovens cook food like never before - no mess, no fuss, no fuel. They are already making ripples of change and expanding cooking possibilities as reliable, portable, easy stoves.
The GoSun Chill builds off the same innovations and cools your goods completely ice-free and off-the-grid. 
 

 
Using solar and energy transfer technology, GoSun Chill uses one third the energy of typical portable fridges. The Chill applies an all-electric brushless DC compressor instead of the more commonly used thermo-electric coolers - which are terribly inefficient.
Our efficient brushless DC compressor draws only 40 watts of power - letting it keep your goods cool without using too much energy. Because it’s not thermoelectric, GoSun is also completely quiet, fully controllable and extremely durable.
 
Features that matter

Not just a box that carries ice, the GoSun Chill comes with everything you'll need for long-term chilling.  A deeper look into the features reveals the perfect blend of form and function, a signature of GoSun Design.


A deeper look into the features:​


Tie-Down Straps
Elastic straps with multiple connection points allow you to strap down your gear and go.


Charge Devices
Power when you need it, the detachable Powerbank can fully recharge your phone over 10 times.


Storage Pouches
Accessory pouches hold all your essentials, with lots of room for extras: keys, cards, phone...


Easy Carry Handles
Integrated handles and a dry weight of 28 LBS (13kg), make it easy to carry the Chill or load up.


Bottle Opener
No searching, you can pop open the bottle cap right on-board.


Removable Lid 
Great for when serving or display your goods, the insulated lid comes on and off in a snap.


All Terrain Wheels
Possibly the greatest invention of all time, these rugged wheels are ready for action.

 
Introducing GoSun's Solar Table 

The 15lb (7kg) folding Solar Table is designed to recharge your Powerbank in a few hours while providing a table surface and shade for the Chill.  You can always use a table and it is no problem to work on top of the tempered glass surface of the solar panel.  Shade will keep your cooler much cooler.  It's lightweight aluminum frame folds into a portable package that is easy to carry and store.  

 
Flexible Solar Panel 

Our flexible solar panel packs into a super thin carry that you can fit on top of the Chill. When you need solar energy, simply unfold and let the Sun cool your drinks down.

You can also use the panel as a portable power station to charge up your Powerbank and other devices.  Solar is amazing.

The Apex Camping Shelter is a  versatile, high quality weather
 shelter that will protect you and your gear from rain, wind, sun, and 
even snow! This tarp was designed to work with the GO! Hammock, but it 
can be used with virtually any camping hammock on the market. It also 
makes a great  all-purpose camping tarp, or  shade canopy,  even when 
you're not using a hammock! 





The Apex is lightweight, portable and easy to set up. 
Setup is simple with the included guy ropes and stakes. It packs up easily into the included stuff sack. For maximum durability, the Apex is made from high strength 70d 
polyester fabric with a waterproof polyurethane coating. The ridgeline 
is professionally sealed with permanent waterproofing tape. Each of the 
20 tie out loops is reinforced to create strong attachment points.

<p>The Copper Ledge Falls is a wooden dory built by Jerry Briggs for Martin Litton, founder of Grand Canyon Dories and Northwest Dories. Litton started the tradition of naming all of his dories after sacred places threatened or trampled by acts of man; this boat is named The Copper Ledge Falls after a substantial rapid flooded by the completion of Hells Canyon Dam on the Snake river in 1967.</p>
<p>Rowing wooden dories in whitewater is an exercise in true love. When things are smooth its the best feeling in the world, but rivers are not always smooth and plan B does not always work. Much of the magic around these boats comes from the love and care given, to keep them floating down stream. The Copper Ledge has some years on her, she has hit rocks countless times, and been repaired with love countless times. Her existence tells a story more important than the countless river tales told by river folk everywhere.</p>
<p>Rivers are my home. The love of rivers and the boats on which we travel them have taught me to be the person I am. I owe them many things, the least of which is to stand up. Stand up and fight.  Many of these rivers and the ecosystems that depend on them are under threat. Through The Dory Project, I am working to preserve and continue the history of wooden boats on rivers, while drawing attention to the issues and threats facing rivers in the American West. Restoring The Copper Ledge to her former glory is the first step towards this goal.</p>
<p>I am fundraising for the materials needed to bring The Copper Ledge back to life. She is built out of marine grade plywood encased in fiberglass and epoxy, her ribs are cedar and her gunnels are oak. I am replacing almost all of her structural components, rebuilding her deck and replacing her floor. She is getting a new transom as well, as I plan to gift the current transom back to the main guide who rowed her for so long, as a thank you for all the love and care he gave her.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and donations. You are helping me to continue on my dream of little wooden boats on big rivers.</p>

The availability of fossil fuels are coming to an end. For mankind to survive we must find an alternative. One of the alternatives is changing to Solar PV. SPV generated electricity is the ""electronic energy”, environmentally most benign, will be the lowest cost electricity in the energy mix. Ref.1. Just in the last decade 100 GW of SPV generation has been installed worldwide, creating 1 million jobs. As the change from fossil fuels to SPV advances, this industry is forecast to grow 1000 fold in the next 50 years.

There are good reasons also to exploit the available light inside buildings. The first company formed to do this task is IBPV, ""Inside Buildings PV”. IBPV is a division of Nanergy Solar, the source of technology. </span></h4><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The amount of sunshine going through windows is large. In the US for example, if we count both residential and commercial east, south and west facing windows, this comes out to more than 20 meter square per resident. If all this sunlight is converted with 15% efficiency, we could generate 1000GW of IBPV electricity. This is today the US conventional electricity generating capacity.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">There are many persons who have no outdoor opportunity to install solar panels. People in apartments, high rise city residences, etc. All of these users of electricity will also have now access to participate in the clean, green energy revolution. Even if you have outdoor SPV installation, you may find it useful combining it with SW products, specially the battery capabilities.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;""><br/></span></p><h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px;"">INNOVATIONS PRESENTED IN THE SW CAMPAIGN</span></h3><p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">The basic products developed under this campaign and available as perks are based on novel type of Solar Panels, the “Sunshade” and “Suncurtain”. The PV panel components are supplied by Nanergy Solar, either based on crystalline Si, cSi or thin films such as amorphous Si aSi or CIGS, and the products are designed, tooled and assembled by IBPV. We do not use any PV material that includes any toxic, carcinogenic compounds such as Cd Cadmium in CdTe. Both the Sunshade and Suncurtain are flexible and much lighter than their outdoor brothers and their mounting is simple enough to be done by the home user/buyer, thus eliminating the costs associated with the installation of the outdoor PV product.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS OF PRODUCTS</h3><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The two basic novel products developed, the “Sunshade” and the “Suncurtain”, are based on the same ”laminate”, “blade” construction.  On a circuit board base, 0.5 to 2 mm thick, 70 mm wide and 500 mm long (the size may vary according to need), are the cSi wafers mounted and interconnected in series to give 14V output </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. Using 15% efficient wafers, a typical laminate will produce 5 watts of SPV electricity per laminate (14V x 0.36A = 5W) under full sun. The pictures below show the laminates </span>interconnected<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> with </span>flexible flat connectors into the Sunshade. The second picture shows the connection of the coaxial cable, going from the Sunshade to the battery.</p><p>FIG 1</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/484776/files/20140404180308-blinds.jpg?1396659788"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The vertical dimension of the Sunshade can be </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">increased</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> in increments of the blade's width. For a window 0.5 meter long, there will be 7 laminates. The seven laminates are interconnected in parallel with a total output of 14V x 2.5A = 35W. The power output in full sunshine, assuming 15% reflection losses through the window will decrease to about 30W. This product will generate 120W DC SPV electricity per square meter of windows. The amount of electricity generated changes very little whether the laminates are open (horizontal position), or they are closed (vertical position). We may also use more efficient cSi wafers, up to 20% efficiency.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">FIG 2</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/484982/files/20140404205115-sunshade1.jpg?1396669875"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In the Suncurtain product the same laminates are used as shown above. </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Figure 3</span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/483917/files/20140404110912-Image_4-2.JPG?1396634952"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In Figure 4A and 4B pictures show the Suncurtains with </span>vertical<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> laminates.

In future commercial marketing in addition to several standard sizes, custom dimensions will also be available.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p></p><p></p><p>To protect the products, the laminates are dipped into transparent acrylic. </p><p>Both the Sunshade and the Suncurtain can be pulled out of the way and folded into a harmonica position. For example a 120W Suncurtain in the open position is a sheet of 2mm x 2.0m x 0.5m curtain. If the laminates go in the vertical dimension, this will fold into a volume of less <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">than 0.05m x 0.08m x 2.0m. If the laminates go in the horizontal direction, the folded Suncurtain fits into a volume of </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">less than 0.1m x 0.08m x 0.5m.

This can be used indoors as a night light.</p><p>The remaining five perks are all power generator of differing capacity. The SW50 and SW150 have both portable power banks charged by SW devices. The smallest one has a 10W foldable Suncurtain, and a 15000 mAh LiFePO(4) battery. The battery has a number of different output, capable of charging several different portable devices.

This service is free with your committing for the SWP-4k system. This system is identical with the ""Sunowner"" offered in outdoor installations.</p><p>Basically there are two ways to go with the inside hook up. Either run directly certain appliances only, or take off part of your home electricity supply from the grid and hard wired it to the SW-4k 2kw inverter. Our expert electricians will take care of this in a safe way.</p><p>You also should be aware, that with this decision you have now joined ""the battle for the sun”. We recommend you do research on this topic. You might start with an article of the same title on the Nanergy web site - <a href=""http://www.nanergysolar.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nanergysolar.com</a></p><p>Some of the basic comparison is done on Table 2. The competing approach is offered by a number of leasing companies. Some of the largest players are Solar City, Sun Edison, SunPower, One Roof Energy, SunRun, Sungevity, Vivint Solar etc. When we mention any one of these companies we refer to it as the leasing method. The largest of these companies is City Solar, as noted in Table 2.</p><p></p><p>It is also to be noted that the largest Sunshade sw5/SV a 1 meter x 2 meter Vertical Sunshade comes with an automated tracker. That is, the laminates rotate from facing east to west as they follow the sun. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This way we expect more than 10% gain in SPV generated by this Sunshade, from 300 watts for a stationary 2 meter square, 20% efficient wafer laminate to 340 Watts for the tracking version.</span></p><p>Please also note, as you build up your cumulative SW SPV indoor capacity, you can order additional battery components, or Suncurtain components through this program. The price of 1.2 kW Suncurtain is $1500, 1kWh LiFePO(4) battery is available for $1000 and 1kWh NiFe battery costs $600.</p><p>Any outdoor SPV system, compatible with the Sunowner approach installed through the SW SPV campaign, can be added seamlessly to the SW system built here.

Nanergy Solar offers a very similar product for outdoors, roof mounted or free standing at the same price as SW systems. Such outdoor system can be combined seamlessly with the SW system, specially using its inverters and batteries. You have a choice. You do not have to pay rent payment for sunshine to third party financing companies or to the utility for PV electricity which you loose when you need it most namely when the grid is out. And most of all the Nanergy Solar Sunowner product with batteries is at a lower price than any of the leasing company or utility competitors.</p><p>For contributors who wish to pursue federal and state incentives we will convert a contribution to a purchase and provide an invoice prior to delivery at the request of the contributor.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>THE ORGANIZERS</h3><p></p><p>The primary organizers are: </p><p>CEO - Sebastian Ferrari </p><p> CTO - Isaac Lund                                            </p><p>Design Consultant - August Lehrecke                                           </p><p>Engineering Consultant - Max Kiss                                            </p><p>Zoltan Kiss - Technical adviser</p><p>John Tuttle - Technical adviser</p><p>The Campaign is organized by IBPV, a division of Nanergy Solar, in a collaboration with <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A Lehrecke a student at RISD.

Both Drs Kiss and Tuttle are physicists with 50 and 30 years experience respectively in the PV industry. Dr Kiss started at RCA Laboratories in Princeton NJ, where the first cSi PV modules were fabricated and the aSi devices were developed. Dr Tuttle was one of the members of the NREL research team that developed and demonstrated the most efficient CIGS solar cells.</p><p>Some of the accomplishments of Dr Kiss and his colleges are shown in the collage below.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/484883/files/20140404191601-1.jpg?1396664161"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">These same personnel of Nanergy Solar were present at the birth of the modern PV industry in the early 1960’s. Bell Labs and RCA Labs were the first ones to make crystalline solar panels. At the same time, amorphous Silicon thin film was also demonstrated as a PV device.

</h4><p></p><p>In the SW (Solar Window) Sunshade, Suncurtain campaign <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">we require a minimum of $150,000 to accomplish three major tasks</span></p><p>i)    $50,000 to complete the design of the Sunshade and Suncurtain products</p><p>ii)   $50,000 to pay for the tooling of the components needed for volume production and</p><p>iii)   $50,000 to carry out the necessary certifications and approvals needed for distribution in various geographic areas</p><p></p><p>The main corporate effort at Nanergy Solar is at developing the next generation multi junction thin film PV module technology. The goal of this program is to reach 25% efficient multi junction thin film modules, with a manufacturing cost of $0.25 per watt by 2020. With this module cost the cost of PV electricity can be lowered by an additional factor of three to about $0.04 per kWh.</p><p>Parallel with this main effort, several usable advanced product ideas are developed and demonstrated at Nanergy Solar and we hope to fund the commercialization of these ideas by crowd funding like the present SW campaign.</p><p><br/></p><h3>THE TIMING OF DELIVERIES</h3><p>The design and certification has already started, the tooling will take place when the funds become available.</p><p>Products based on aSi modules as used in products 1 and 2 are available from earlier times. We propose to start to deliver those in July 2014. Products 3, 4, 5,  6, and 7, based on the Sunshade and  Suncurtains using crystalline and poly crystalline silicon wafers we propose to start deliveries four month after the funds are available in October  2014.</p><p>Depending on the size of interest, the completion of deliveries are estimated to be two to three month after deliveries for the specific products begin</p><p></p><p>Finally the personnel associated with Nanergy Solar have a strong belief that the energy transformation from fossil fuel to renewable energy such as SPV can be also an instrument of social justice. We envision the penetration and installation of residential solar SPV electricity generation, where the user owns the generation as a collective effort by the communities themselves. This energy transformation can be the basis of self-sustaining communities. You welcome to review a business plan on the Nanergy Solar website for such potential profitable communities. </p><p></p><p><br/></p><h4></h4><h3>FAQ</h3><h3><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">____________________________________________________________</span></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""><br/></span></p><p>1. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">HOW DO YOU COMBINE SW GENERATED ELECTRICITY WITH THE GRID ELECTRICITY IN THE BUILDING?</span></p><p>AC electricity supplied by SW systems should not be plugged into the grid sockets in the wall. Physically the system will work and the electricity you generate will flow back to the grid, but this is against utility regulations.</p><p></p><p>Only grid interactive inverters are allowed by utilities. That means, when the grid is out your solar power is wasted. SW AC generators, like an appliance, should be used to operate specific loads, that you plug in directly.</p><p>It is possible to make the SW generated electricity compatible with the grid, but this should only be considered for greater then 1kW WS electricity generation. We actually recommend to operate the WS system parallel with the grid and build up an independent (UPS type) user/ homeowner electricity supply without getting involved in utility politics and associated costs. Also remember in the event you change residence, you can take this with you without any difficulty.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2. HOW BEST CAN YOU SIZE YOUR HOME FOR SW ELECTRICITY GENERATION?</span></p><p> We all need an emergency electricity  source in case of power failure. The SW  AC system can give you that with adequate power if you have enough windows. If you want to audit, just how much maximum power could you generate with SW, measure the total east, south and west facing windows in units of meter square. Than multiply the number of square meters by 160 watts (electricity generated by 16% efficient Suncurtain per m(2)) <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">x  4 hours (the number of equivalent peak sun hours per day in the winter in NY) = 640Wh/day/m(2) = 0.64 kWh/day/m(2). Round this off to 0.5 kWh/m(2) of window area.</span></p><p>The power usage of the different appliances can be grouped in three categories</p><p>i.)  PC, cell phones, cameras and other portable instruments and certain lights can be run from the DC power block, that is 120 Wh and is charged by a single 30 W Sunshade (SW-150)</p><p>ii.)  television, desk computers ,room lights, fans will require 0.5 kWH power block battery,120W sunshade and 500W AC inverter (SW-500)</p><p>iii.)  window air conditioners, microwave ovens, refrigerators will need 1kWh battery storage and 1kW inverter (SW-1)</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Since the batteries can also be charged by grid electricity,  you can enlarge your battery bank without adding any additional WS and use the 1kW inverter which comes with perk SW-1</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">3.  WHAT BATTERIES DO YOU USE?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Up to 1 kWh we use the safest version of Li batteries with LiFePO4 anodes. They have a demonstrated cycle time of about 1000 cycles. If you are interested in the largest package of the SW apartment product <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">than we recommend to use NiFe batteries, with guaranteed 10,000 cycles+, the same life as the expected life of the Sunshade or Suncurtain of 25 years. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">4. WHAT SOLAR PANELS DO YOU USE?</span></p><p>We use different manufacturers of crystalline and poly crystalline wafers, with efficiency between 15% and 20%. For the BIPV samplers we use thin film aSi plates. </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">5. HOW DO WE MOUNT THE SUNSHADES AND SUNCURTAINS?</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>Like mounting standard curtains, we supply the fasteners and the upper “ROD”. Just by following instructions <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">an adult can do the mounting in about one hour. </span></p><p>For SW-4 and greater, the 2 square meter Sunshades are utilized. For this specific product, there is an automatic remote controlled motor drive that follows the sun for maximum efficiency. It also opens and closes the sunshade automatically. </p><p>If you are interested in SWP-4 or larger, the campaign will do the installation with Nanergy Solar personnel. An audit team will come out shortly after your commitment <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to the campaign to review how much window asset is available and what are your load requirements. The team will also recommend what combination of SW components are most suitable for your needs.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">6. WHAT FINANCIAL HELP DOES WS ELECTRICITY GENERATION OFFER?</span></p><p>The first benefit is that you save the cost of the curtains or blinds that the Sunshade or Suncurtain replaces. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Depending on your tastes this can range between $25 and $100 per square meter or higher.</span></p><p>Depending on the states you reside in, there may be differing subsidies available. We make no representation at this point as to the availability of subsidies. If you want to pursue federal or state subsidies, at your request we convert your gift to a purchase prior to shipment and will issue an invoice.</p><p>After having said that we strongly believe there is no justification to differentiate subsidies only for the utility interactive systems.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">7.  CAN THESE SW SYSTEMS BE USED INTERNATIONALLY?</span></p><p></p><p>Yes the system can be delivered with appropriate inverters with 60 cycles or 50 cycles and the appropriate voltages used in different part of the world.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">8.   IS THE ELECTRICITY PRODUCED MONITORED AND CONTROLLED.?</span></p><p>Yes the combiner box in the battery is equipped with a meter that reads 4 quantities, charging current, b<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">attery status, voltage output and output current. This can be coupled with a suitable application (available </span>separately) to your smart phone and be recorded.</p><p>9. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SUNSHADE OR SUNCURTAIN BREAKS?</p><p>The products have a manufacturing warranty for workmanship for 1 year. They also have performance warranties for 25 years; ""The SW product will not loose more than 15% of its poet output in 25 years"". This 25 year warranty also holds for the NiFe batteries. For the Li batteries 500 cycles are guaranteed at full capacity. A second 500 cycles can be extended at an 80% discharge level.</p><p>If the SW converter breaks in the first year, due to manufacturers fault, the SPV generator will be replaced. The curtains and the shades can be repaired by the owner, by replacing the broken laminates, provided by the campaign or Nanergy Solar.</p><p>10. WHAT IS THE BEST SOLUTION TO WORK OUT A COMPATIBLE SPV GENERATION WITH THE UTILITIES?</p><p>This is a very complex question, much discussed these days in the professional journals. Until now the utilities were the primary rent collectors for sunshine. With the leasing companies strongly backed by the big banks the rent collection is moving to Wall Street. When you lease the SPV on your own roof, you are paying for sunshine through the leasing companies to their backers the big banks.</p><p>Ideally the utilities grid should not be disconnected from your home, but the user should have the right to own their system. Also it would be in everyone's interest that the grid has access to the dispatch<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">able stored renewable electricity, which is stored in your batteries. Effectively this is the smart grid, where the utilities are connected to your home through the micro grid, where you also share your stored electricity.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p></p></div>","Short SummaryLook at this home. This shows ""Solar Windows” “SW” and starts the “SW” campaign. Exploiting the light coming through widows, patio doors, any sources of outside light, Sunshades and Suncurtains in Solar Windows convert it to SPV (Solar PV) electricity inside your home. In the pictured apartment it is possible to generate over 2kW of electricity*. It would be enough to operate most of your electrical appliances.(* assumes 7x2 square meter windows, 16% PV cell efficiency outside the windows would generate 238 Watts. In 5 hours of sun delivering 12kWh per day. Assuming 20% loss going through the windows, SW could generate a maximum energy of 10kWh)WHAT BENEFITS DOES THE CAMPAIGN OFFER?If you are an apartment dweller, now you too can participate in the SPV renewable energy revolution. With the use of Sunshades in big cities old buildings can be electrified without altering landmark buildings.The installed cost of Sunshade and Suncurtain SPV generators is less than conventional SPV modules because they do not have to be protected from the elements, and their installation cost and associated hardware is missing.Suncurtains are much lighter than conventional glass to glass PV modules ( < 2kg compared to 10Kg/meter square) and they lend themselves for portable application. The SPV generators combined with either AC or DC mother battery storage offer cost-effective electricity delivery even when the electric grid is out.Come along with us on the journey to replace fossils with SPV in the 21st century.                           SPV is one of the best candidates to take the majority in the energy mix in this century. (Reference 1). In the process we have an opportunity to create more than 100 million jobs world wide, influence the post free market economy and help Main Street  to generate their own SPV electricity. Nanergy Solar  www.nanergysolar.com explains the journey in greater detail. Please start by contributing to our SW campaign. THE BIG PICTURE, HOW FAR SPV HAS COMEThe present Indiegogo campaign is a part of the energy transformation. The availability of fossil fuels are coming to an end. For mankind to survive we must find an alternative. One of the alternatives is changing to Solar PV. SPV generated electricity is the ""electronic energy”, environmentally most benign, will be the lowest cost electricity in the energy mix. Ref.1. Just in the last decade 100 GW of SPV generation has been installed worldwide, creating 1 million jobs. As the change from fossil fuels to SPV advances, this industry is forecast to grow 1000 fold in the next 50 years. Ref.2.Ref.1. http://www.seekingalpha.com/article/1324411-trends-in-the-cost-of-energyRef.2.  http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios.htmlALSO EXPLOIT LIGHT INSIDE YOUR HOMEUntil now, the installed SPV capacity was done outside, under direct sunlight. There are good reasons also to exploit the available light inside buildings. The first company formed to do this task is IBPV, ""Inside Buildings PV”. IBPV is a division of Nanergy Solar, the source of technology. The amount of sunshine going through windows is large. In the US for example, if we count both residential and commercial east, south and west facing windows, this comes out to more than 20 meter square per resident. If all this sunlight is converted with 15% efficiency, we could generate 1000GW of IBPV electricity. This is today the US conventional electricity generating capacity.There are many persons who have no outdoor opportunity to install solar panels. People in apartments, high rise city residences, etc. All of these users of electricity will also have now access to participate in the clean, green energy revolution. Even if you have outdoor SPV installation, you may find it useful combining it with SW products, specially the battery capabilities.INNOVATIONS PRESENTED IN THE SW CAMPAIGNThe basic products developed under this campaign and available as perks are based on novel type of Solar Panels, the “Sunshade” and “Suncurtain”. The PV panel components are supplied by Nanergy Solar, either based on crystalline Si, cSi or thin films such as amorphous Si aSi or CIGS, and the products are designed, tooled and assembled by IBPV. We do not use any PV material that includes any toxic, carcinogenic compounds such as Cd Cadmium in CdTe. Both the Sunshade and Suncurtain are flexible and much lighter than their outdoor brothers and their mounting is simple enough to be done by the home user/buyer, thus eliminating the costs associated with the installation of the outdoor PV product.TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS OF PRODUCTSThe two basic novel products developed, the “Sunshade” and the “Suncurtain”, are based on the same ”laminate”, “blade” construction.  On a circuit board base, 0.5 to 2 mm thick, 70 mm wide and 500 mm long (the size may vary according to need), are the cSi wafers mounted and interconnected in series to give 14V output . Using 15% efficient wafers, a typical laminate will produce 5 watts of SPV electricity per laminate (14V x 0.36A = 5W) under full sun. The pictures below show the laminates interconnected with flexible flat connectors into the Sunshade. The second picture shows the connection of the coaxial cable, going from the Sunshade to the battery.FIG 1The vertical dimension of the Sunshade can be increased in increments of the blade's width. For a window 0.5 meter long, there will be 7 laminates. The seven laminates are interconnected in parallel with a total output of 14V x 2.5A = 35W. The power output in full sunshine, assuming 15% reflection losses through the window will decrease to about 30W. This product will generate 120W DC SPV electricity per square meter of windows. The amount of electricity generated changes very little whether the laminates are open (horizontal position), or they are closed (vertical position). We may also use more efficient cSi wafers, up to 20% efficiency.FIG 2In the Suncurtain product the same laminates are used as shown above. Figure 3In Figure 4A and 4B pictures show the Suncurtains with vertical laminates. On Figure 4A the Suncurtains are open. The curtains like a harmonica on either side of the windows gathers into a narrow fold. On Figure 4B the Suncurtain is fully covering the four windows.Figure 4C, shows a Sunshade in the open position with the laminates being horizontal. In this example of Sunshades, the long dimension of the laminates are in horizontal direction. In the present campaign, the length of both the Suncurtains and Sunshades can come in increments of 0.5 meter. In future commercial marketing in addition to several standard sizes, custom dimensions will also be available.To protect the products, the laminates are dipped into transparent acrylic. Both the Sunshade and the Suncurtain can be pulled out of the way and folded into a harmonica position. For example a 120W Suncurtain in the open position is a sheet of 2mm x 2.0m x 0.5m curtain. If the laminates go in the vertical dimension, this will fold into a volume of less than 0.05m x 0.08m x 2.0m. If the laminates go in the horizontal direction, the folded Suncurtain fits into a volume of less than 0.1m x 0.08m x 0.5m. The weight of the Sunshade or Suncuratin are less than 2kg per square meter.FIG 4A                                                        FIG 4CFIG 4B                                                           FIG 4DPRODUCTSThe first products on the list are two examples of the fact, that not only sunlight, but also normal scattered daylight inside the rooms can be exploited. The aSi PV technology is specially useful for this purpose. You may have a calculator operated by aSi PV. They are so sensitive that they can work by moonlight. The first perks both convert the PV generated and stored energy to white light, using an LED.The candle may be an interesting decoration for you to put in the window, like Christmas candles.You will never have to worry about it.The candle will come on every night when it becomes dark and will shot off automatically when the sun comes up. The batteries should last for about 2 years, the PV panel generates about 0.2 Watts in sunlight.The PV panel of the night light is about 1W. This can be used indoors as a night light.The remaining five perks are all power generator of differing capacity. The SW50 and SW150 have both portable power banks charged by SW devices. The smallest one has a 10W foldable Suncurtain, and a 15000 mAh LiFePO(4) battery. The battery has a number of different output, capable of charging several different portable devices. It can even start your car when its battery is failing. For all the applications and specifications see the images below.

The five products offered in this campaign are all based on the SW SPV electricity generation charging batteries and from the batteries deliver to either the DC or AC loads. All the products are SPV uninterrupted power supplies (SPV UPS).There are two kinds of batteries in the product line. When the power supplies are used in an emergency situation, the LiFePO(4) batteries are used. Their cycle times are limited to about 1000 cycles. For the larger systems where continuous supply is the goal we switch to NiFe batteries that are known to be able to perform for over 10,000 cycles+. The 5 basic products are summarized in Table1.All these systems can run certain appliances. Some of the frequently used appliance consumption is listed below. These are the least energy consumer versions.

These can be combined into a single system. It can also be combined with an outdoor SPV installation and can be increased in a modular fashion to a maximum allowed by your total suitable window space.If your plans are to head toward this goal, we strongly urge you to invite the Nanergy Solar team to audit your space, and recommend the best way to proceed. This service is free with your committing for the SWP-4k system. This system is identical with the ""Sunowner"" offered in outdoor installations.Basically there are two ways to go with the inside hook up. Either run directly certain appliances only, or take off part of your home electricity supply from the grid and hard wired it to the SW-4k 2kw inverter. Our expert electricians will take care of this in a safe way.You also should be aware, that with this decision you have now joined ""the battle for the sun”. We recommend you do research on this topic. You might start with an article of the same title on the Nanergy web site - www.nanergysolar.comSome of the basic comparison is done on Table 2. The competing approach is offered by a number of leasing companies. Some of the largest players are Solar City, Sun Edison, SunPower, One Roof Energy, SunRun, Sungevity, Vivint Solar etc. When we mention any one of these companies we refer to it as the leasing method. The largest of these companies is City Solar, as noted in Table 2.It is also to be noted that the largest Sunshade sw5/SV a 1 meter x 2 meter Vertical Sunshade comes with an automated tracker. That is, the laminates rotate from facing east to west as they follow the sun. This way we expect more than 10% gain in SPV generated by this Sunshade, from 300 watts for a stationary 2 meter square, 20% efficient wafer laminate to 340 Watts for the tracking version.Please also note, as you build up your cumulative SW SPV indoor capacity, you can order additional battery components, or Suncurtain components through this program. The price of 1.2 kW Suncurtain is $1500, 1kWh LiFePO(4) battery is available for $1000 and 1kWh NiFe battery costs $600.Any outdoor SPV system, compatible with the Sunowner approach installed through the SW SPV campaign, can be added seamlessly to the SW system built here. For further information contact Nanergy Solar.SW CAMPAIGN CHOICESThe campaign has a number of standard dimensions available both in Sunshades and Suncurtains. There are five different sizes   sw1= 0.5m x 0.5m                                                                sw2 = 0.5m X 1.0msw3 = 0.5m x 2.0m                                         sw4 = 1.0m x 1.0msw5 = 1.0m x 2.0mThe products can be ordered with the laminates aligned horizontally (H) or vertically (V)There are two basic choices Sunshades (S) or Suncurtains (C)The colors for the four different backing materials are shown below:The yellow (cA),  The patterned (cB), The dark/light brown (cC) The blue (cD)With the above conventions the products in 4A and 4B would be designated sw5/CV/cC and the picture in 4C and 4D designated as sw4/SH/cBThe yellow (cA),  The patterned (cB), The dark/light brown (cC) The blue (cD)ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONSEconomic scale installation only comes into effect with the use of of the largest quoted product WSP-4kWh.The system has 1kW SPV and 4kWh of battery storage. A residential user has two primary other options, either buy from the utility or use a third party lease purchase, such as offered by Solar City. The three scenarios are compared in Table 2.*The Solar City and utility prices are from the SEA report for 2013** The Sunshade and the Suncurtain installation by the owner about 1 hour*** This year we still count the 30% ITC**** In California there is additional 60% subsidy for batteries***** the battery cost for SWP-$ is $400/10,000= $0.04/kWh, for Solar City $1000/1000=$1.0/kWhIf we take the 30% ITC for both the batteries and PV and assume $1/W materials savings plus 60% battery subsidy, than the value to be amortized is $1.20/W. Depending on location for insolation (2000 hrs) and electricity prices ($0.18/kWh), the payback is less than 4 years. This calculation assumes that the same subsidies are available for all the systems.We do not make any representations as to what subsidies will be available for SW SPV generation. We see no reason why there should be different rules for the SW  or the leased systemsThere is no question you own the SW products and can easily take it with you. Nanergy Solar offers a very similar product for outdoors, roof mounted or free standing at the same price as SW systems. Such outdoor system can be combined seamlessly with the SW system, specially using its inverters and batteries. You have a choice. You do not have to pay rent payment for sunshine to third party financing companies or to the utility for PV electricity which you loose when you need it most namely when the grid is out. And most of all the Nanergy Solar Sunowner product with batteries is at a lower price than any of the leasing company or utility competitors.For contributors who wish to pursue federal and state incentives we will convert a contribution to a purchase and provide an invoice prior to delivery at the request of the contributor.THE ORGANIZERSThe primary organizers are: CEO - Sebastian Ferrari  CTO - Isaac Lund                                            Design Consultant - August Lehrecke                                           Engineering Consultant - Max Kiss                                            Zoltan Kiss - Technical adviserJohn Tuttle - Technical adviserThe Campaign is organized by IBPV, a division of Nanergy Solar, in a collaboration with A Lehrecke a student at RISD. I Lund is a PhD candidate at Albany Nano and M Kiss completing Engineering at University of Michigan. For the resumes of the technical advisors go to the Nanergy Solar website. Nanergy Solar Inc - www.nanergysolar.com   email: indiegogo@nanergysolar.comTelephone 609-423-4115PAST EXPERIENCE, HISTORYTo have confidence in the fulfillment of the commitments outlined in this campaign we recommend you review the record and history of the two technical advisors. Both Drs Kiss and Tuttle are physicists with 50 and 30 years experience respectively in the PV industry. Dr Kiss started at RCA Laboratories in Princeton NJ, where the first cSi PV modules were fabricated and the aSi devices were developed. Dr Tuttle was one of the members of the NREL research team that developed and demonstrated the most efficient CIGS solar cells.Some of the accomplishments of Dr Kiss and his colleges are shown in the collage below.These same personnel of Nanergy Solar were present at the birth of the modern PV industry in the early 1960’s. Bell Labs and RCA Labs were the first ones to make crystalline solar panels. At the same time, amorphous Silicon thin film was also demonstrated as a PV device. Some of the highlights of this journey:First Solar calculator – Princeton, NJ by Optel 1971First SPV watch by Optel 1973First thin film module manufacturing of Port Jarvis, NY by Chronar 1982First PV power project Birmingham, Alabama by Chronar 1985First SPV consumer product the Walklite by Chronar 1986Sale of first PV factory Lens, France by Chronar 1986First PV factory in Harbin, China by Chronar 1988BIPV Times Square, New York City by EPV 2002SPV water pumping in Africa by Nanergy 2006Tandem aSi devices and manufacturing by Amelio Solar 2010
USE OF FUNDS
In the SW (Solar Window) Sunshade, Suncurtain campaign we require a minimum of $150,000 to accomplish three major tasksi)    $50,000 to complete the design of the Sunshade and Suncurtain productsii)   $50,000 to pay for the tooling of the components needed for volume production andiii)   $50,000 to carry out the necessary certifications and approvals needed for distribution in various geographic areasThe main corporate effort at Nanergy Solar is at developing the next generation multi junction thin film PV module technology. The goal of this program is to reach 25% efficient multi junction thin film modules, with a manufacturing cost of $0.25 per watt by 2020. With this module cost the cost of PV electricity can be lowered by an additional factor of three to about $0.04 per kWh.Parallel with this main effort, several usable advanced product ideas are developed and demonstrated at Nanergy Solar and we hope to fund the commercialization of these ideas by crowd funding like the present SW campaign.THE TIMING OF DELIVERIESThe design and certification has already started, the tooling will take place when the funds become available.Products based on aSi modules as used in products 1 and 2 are available from earlier times. We propose to start to deliver those in July 2014. Products 3, 4, 5,  6, and 7, based on the Sunshade and  Suncurtains using crystalline and poly crystalline silicon wafers we propose to start deliveries four month after the funds are available in October  2014.Depending on the size of interest, the completion of deliveries are estimated to be two to three month after deliveries for the specific products beginFinally the personnel associated with Nanergy Solar have a strong belief that the energy transformation from fossil fuel to renewable energy such as SPV can be also an instrument of social justice. We envision the penetration and installation of residential solar SPV electricity generation, where the user owns the generation as a collective effort by the communities themselves. This energy transformation can be the basis of self-sustaining communities. You welcome to review a business plan on the Nanergy Solar website for such potential profitable communities. FAQ____________________________________________________________1. HOW DO YOU COMBINE SW GENERATED ELECTRICITY WITH THE GRID ELECTRICITY IN THE BUILDING?AC electricity supplied by SW systems should not be plugged into the grid sockets in the wall. Physically the system will work and the electricity you generate will flow back to the grid, but this is against utility regulations.Only grid interactive inverters are allowed by utilities. That means, when the grid is out your solar power is wasted. SW AC generators, like an appliance, should be used to operate specific loads, that you plug in directly.It is possible to make the SW generated electricity compatible with the grid, but this should only be considered for greater then 1kW WS electricity generation. We actually recommend to operate the WS system parallel with the grid and build up an independent (UPS type) user/ homeowner electricity supply without getting involved in utility politics and associated costs. Also remember in the event you change residence, you can take this with you without any difficulty.2. HOW BEST CAN YOU SIZE YOUR HOME FOR SW ELECTRICITY GENERATION? We all need an emergency electricity  source in case of power failure. The SW  AC system can give you that with adequate power if you have enough windows. If you want to audit, just how much maximum power could you generate with SW, measure the total east, south and west facing windows in units of meter square. Than multiply the number of square meters by 160 watts (electricity generated by 16% efficient Suncurtain per m(2)) x  4 hours (the number of equivalent peak sun hours per day in the winter in NY) = 640Wh/day/m(2) = 0.64 kWh/day/m(2). Round this off to 0.5 kWh/m(2) of window area.The power usage of the different appliances can be grouped in three categoriesi.)  PC, cell phones, cameras and other portable instruments and certain lights can be run from the DC power block, that is 120 Wh and is charged by a single 30 W Sunshade (SW-150)ii.)  television, desk computers ,room lights, fans will require 0.5 kWH power block battery,120W sunshade and 500W AC inverter (SW-500)iii.)  window air conditioners, microwave ovens, refrigerators will need 1kWh battery storage and 1kW inverter (SW-1)Since the batteries can also be charged by grid electricity,  you can enlarge your battery bank without adding any additional WS and use the 1kW inverter which comes with perk SW-13.  WHAT BATTERIES DO YOU USE?Up to 1 kWh we use the safest version of Li batteries with LiFePO4 anodes. They have a demonstrated cycle time of about 1000 cycles. If you are interested in the largest package of the SW apartment product than we recommend to use NiFe batteries, with guaranteed 10,000 cycles+, the same life as the expected life of the Sunshade or Suncurtain of 25 years. 4. WHAT SOLAR PANELS DO YOU USE?We use different manufacturers of crystalline and poly crystalline wafers, with efficiency between 15% and 20%. For the BIPV samplers we use thin film aSi plates. 5. HOW DO WE MOUNT THE SUNSHADES AND SUNCURTAINS?Like mounting standard curtains, we supply the fasteners and the upper “ROD”. Just by following instructions an adult can do the mounting in about one hour. For SW-4 and greater, the 2 square meter Sunshades are utilized. For this specific product, there is an automatic remote controlled motor drive that follows the sun for maximum efficiency. It also opens and closes the sunshade automatically. If you are interested in SWP-4 or larger, the campaign will do the installation with Nanergy Solar personnel. An audit team will come out shortly after your commitment to the campaign to review how much window asset is available and what are your load requirements. The team will also recommend what combination of SW components are most suitable for your needs.6. WHAT FINANCIAL HELP DOES WS ELECTRICITY GENERATION OFFER?The first benefit is that you save the cost of the curtains or blinds that the Sunshade or Suncurtain replaces. Depending on your tastes this can range between $25 and $100 per square meter or higher.Depending on the states you reside in, there may be differing subsidies available. We make no representation at this point as to the availability of subsidies. If you want to pursue federal or state subsidies, at your request we convert your gift to a purchase prior to shipment and will issue an invoice.After having said that we strongly believe there is no justification to differentiate subsidies only for the utility interactive systems.7.  CAN THESE SW SYSTEMS BE USED INTERNATIONALLY?Yes the system can be delivered with appropriate inverters with 60 cycles or 50 cycles and the appropriate voltages used in different part of the world.8.   IS THE ELECTRICITY PRODUCED MONITORED AND CONTROLLED.?Yes the combiner box in the battery is equipped with a meter that reads 4 quantities, charging current, battery status, voltage output and output current. This can be coupled with a suitable application (available separately) to your smart phone and be recorded.9. WHAT HAPPENS IF THE SUNSHADE OR SUNCURTAIN BREAKS?The products have a manufacturing warranty for workmanship for 1 year. They also have performance warranties for 25 years; ""The SW product will not loose more than 15% of its poet output in 25 years"". This 25 year warranty also holds for the NiFe batteries. For the Li batteries 500 cycles are guaranteed at full capacity. A second 500 cycles can be extended at an 80% discharge level.If the SW converter breaks in the first year, due to manufacturers fault, the SPV generator will be replaced. The curtains and the shades can be repaired by the owner, by replacing the broken laminates, provided by the campaign or Nanergy Solar.10. WHAT IS THE BEST SOLUTION TO WORK OUT A COMPATIBLE SPV GENERATION WITH THE UTILITIES?This is a very complex question, much discussed these days in the professional journals. Until now the utilities were the primary rent collectors for sunshine. With the leasing companies strongly backed by the big banks the rent collection is moving to Wall Street. When you lease the SPV on your own roof, you are paying for sunshine through the leasing companies to their backers the big banks.Ideally the utilities grid should not be disconnected from your home, but the user should have the right to own their system. Also it would be in everyone's interest that the grid has access to the dispatchable stored renewable electricity, which is stored in your batteries. Effectively this is the smart grid, where the utilities are connected to your home through the micro grid, where you also share your stored electricity.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Or perhaps you just want to know what cool stuff is going on each week where you live.</p>
<p>Well, if you're like most people you can associate with at least one of these scenarios and it's pretty sucky.</p>
<p>So we decided to create a travel community where people could not only discover cool places to go but also turn an average holiday experience into something your grandkids will tell their grandkids about....and TravelByU was born.</p>

<h2>What is <a href=""http://www.travelbyu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TravelByU</a>?</h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.travelbyu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>TravelByU.com</strong></a> (literally Travel By You) is an online travel community with a tool that allows people like you to get personalized travel and festival suggestions tailored to your interests.</p>
<p>It was created by two Aussie guys who are totally passionate about travel.</p>
<p><img alt=""Michael pic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://trips.travelbyu.com/indiegogo/grand-canyon-mike.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"" title=""Michael""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;"">Michael worked as a travel agent for many years and realized that people are looking for unique experiences, not just a photo of an attraction you can't even remember the name of. He is a festival addict and most recently threw tomatoes along with some 50,000 others at the La Tomatina Festival in Spain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""James pic"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://trips.travelbyu.com/indiegogo/james-athens.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;"" title=""James""/></p>
<p>James worked for a major online travel brand and taught English in South Korea. He loves diving headfirst into the culture of his destination - be it eating the deadly pufferfish - Fugu/Bok, or getting muddy at the Boryeong Mud Festival. Just make sure you stand well clear if you join him for karaoke...he has some killer dance moves.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<h3>For the Traveler</h3>
<p>Imagine for a moment you like scuba diving. How cool would it be if there was a <a href=""http://www.travelbyu.com/be-inspired"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">search</a> that showed you all the best places to scuba dive around the world?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Inspiration search"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://trips.travelbyu.com/indiegogo/inspiration-search-with-map.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Inspiration search""/></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>That would be pretty cool right..</strong></em></p>
<p>Now that's probably going to give you a ton of results so what if you could filter it by popularity, location or even see which places your friends have been to?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Scuba diving results"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://trips.travelbyu.com/indiegogo/diving-results.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Scuba diving results""/></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Do we have your attention now....</strong></em></p>
<p>Well that is exactly what we have been building over the last couple of years and it gets even better too.... the more you use the site the more we learn about you, what you like and where you want to go. This also enables us to recommend festivals and events that YOU will not only like, but are actually able to attend.</p>
<p><em><strong>So you like dance music and want to visit Sydney, how can we help?</strong></em></p>
<p>Once you have joined the site simply create a wishlist of the places where you want to go (e.g. Sydney). We are currently working on a system that will automagically send you a message when there is an event you might want to see in that destination.</p>
<p><em><strong>Interested?  <a href=""http://www.travelbyu.com/register"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sign me up!</a> </strong></em></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>For the Event Promoter/ DMO</h3>
<p>We are building a platform where festival promoters and tourism boards can get their events in front of the exact people who actually want to go. Rather than spamming everyone in the hope of getting visitors, surely it is better to reach your target audience with measured results.</p>
<p>Let's say you are the organizer of an food festival in San Francisco. Wouldn't it be great if you could target all the foodies living in (or visiting) San Francisco when your event is on?</p>
<p><em><strong>You bet it would.</strong></em></p>
<p><img alt=""Event promoter info"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://trips.travelbyu.com/indiegogo/event-promoter-infographic.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Event promoter info""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You'll get a designated page to showcase your event, see who is going and what people are talking about.</p>
<p>We will give you the tools and you keep control of your content all for a fraction of the cost of running an online (or offline) advertising campaign.</p>
<p><em><strong>It doesn't get any better!</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where will your money go?</h2>
<div>
<p>While passion is a great thing unfortunately it doesn't pay the bills. We have been bootstrapping this project using our own time, and more importantly money which has slowed our progress considerably.</p>
<p>Sure we could put Google ads all over the site like Trip Advisor does but who really wants to feel like they landed on a billboard poster? </p>
<p><em><strong>Not us!</strong></em></p>
<p>We have set a goal of $10,000 which will help us survive another few months.   While the money we are asking for may seem like a lot, it will quickly get eaten up by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ongoing server costs - </strong>the life support system for the site.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing and advertising - </strong>this will help to get the word out on the street so more people just like you can find us too.</li>
<li>
<strong>Buckets of coffee and crates of instant noodles - </strong>life support for us</li>
<li>
<strong>Offsite web development for another three months - </strong>at the moment this is the only person getting paid... and it's coming straight from our wallet</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

Let's face it - we all want to live a full, exciting life right?
Have you ever gone on a vacation, seen all the major tourist sights and come home a little underwhelmed? Only to find out days after you return that there was an amazing festival going on just minutes away from where you just were!
Ever thought to yourself, ""If I see another church, temple, museum or art gallery I'm going to be sick""?

So we decided to create a travel community where people could not only discover cool places to go but also turn an average holiday experience into something your grandkids will tell their grandkids about....and TravelByU was born.
 
What is TravelByU?
TravelByU.com (literally Travel By You) is an online travel community with a tool that allows people like you to get personalized travel and festival suggestions tailored to your interests.
It was created by two Aussie guys who are totally passionate about travel.

Michael worked as a travel agent for many years and realized that people are looking for unique experiences, not just a photo of an attraction you can't even remember the name of. He is a festival addict and most recently threw tomatoes along with some 50,000 others at the La Tomatina Festival in Spain.

He loves diving headfirst into the culture of his destination - be it eating the deadly pufferfish - Fugu/Bok, or getting muddy at the Boryeong Mud Festival. Just make sure you stand well clear if you join him for karaoke...he has some killer dance moves.

This also enables us to recommend festivals and events that YOU will not only like, but are actually able to attend.
So you like dance music and want to visit Sydney, how can we help?
Once you have joined the site simply create a wishlist of the places where you want to go (e.g. Sydney). We are currently working on a system that will automagically send you a message when there is an event you might want to see in that destination.

Hi there! 
We are Polly and Jacopo, a photographer and a developer & designer from Helsinki, Finland. We would like to introduce you to: Iceland, rauður grænn blár.


In June 2013 our dream to visit Iceland finally came true. Ten days and fourteen film rolls after, we have come back to Helsinki with this idea in our heads: putting together a coffee table book with our photographs of the breathtaking Icelandic landscapes.


As we did not want the book to be just a mere collection of images, we thought about involving a selected group of Icelandic poets and writers to help us finding the right words to support our shots.








The writers collaborating with us



When we started to think about the concept of the book, we thought it would have been interesting to collaborate with other artists, to inspire them to put into words the emotions developing from our photographs.For several weeks we had been looking for Icelandic poets and writers interested in helping us with the book. It was difficult to find the right people!Eventually we selected five fabulous Icelandic artists:
Trausti Dagsson
Valur Gunnarsson 
Silja Hansen
Svala Magnea

The title of the book
Our book is called ""Iceland, rauður grænn blár"", in honour of the colours of the Icelandic landscapes: 


rauður red: volcanoes, lava fields, fumaroles...

grænn green: mountains, green fields, farm lands...

blár blue: glaciers, rivers, ocean...

Designing the book

As we love analogue media we have always been very interested in printing.


We have selected the tools and started the design process during the summer. Our focus is to enhance the beauty of the images and the Icelandic language through the use of a clean design and typography. 


We aim in producing a book that you will be proud to display on your bookshelf.

MaccaNow
We have decided to donate a part of what will be raised to a charity, MaccaNow Foundation. 
MaccaNow is Chris McCormack’s foundation, set up to commemorate his mother who passed away from breast cancer in 1999. It provides assistance to families who are in active treatment for breast cancer in order to lessen the financial burdens and improve their quality of life.

<p><span>Like Jock says, hunger is not an issue of food, but of water. Many poor countries, like India have no way of growing a sustainable agriculture through stable irrigation. The rocker water pump can help establish a steady flow of water to help irrigate two acres of land. Your donations will help Jock bring the rocker pump to India and teach the locals how to construct the invention themselves, thus building a micro-enterprise after we have left. We greatly appreciate any amount you can contribute; it will go towards creating a cleaner and more sustainable world.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>To reiterate what was stated in the video, many farmers around the world would love to work with </span>individuals like Jock, but they simply can’t afford the expenses. Your donations will allow for the transportation of materials, such as the concrete pump molds, to India.</p>

For those of you who are interested, here are a few impressions for you. There is only one way to know if you have a winner. That's to put it to the test. We produced an initial order of Chenna Baree in Purple. Why purple? I was as perplexed as other people, but purple won by a popular public poll. Thanks to so many friends and so many other people I don't even know, we have the feedback we need. Everyone wants more colors. That's the verdict. I am so glad we did this test run, because our finals have some important changes and quality improvements. It turns out that the linen canvas being very coarse improves with a second saturation of latex in the foxing area. We replaced insole fiber with canvas belting, and we replaced a glued in insole with a removable one. So that is why I refer to the purple shoes as Prototypes, because there are changes and quality improvements made to the final production specs. And that's what testing is all about. This is the whole idea. We need you in order to make this happen.  I believe that we have demonstrated our investment, our commitment and our integrity. The challenge now is getting these shoes to their rightful owners. That's you!  We appreciate you sharing this project with your friends. It's this spirit that makes Indiegogo such a wonderful way for startup companies to connect with a market. Thank you so much.Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust.Beautiful, classic red linen canvas.Another classic. Beautiful blue linen canvasOlive Green  Slightly conservative but where can you find this shoe?Grey. All round conservative gorgeous linen canvasChenna Baree's flagship- the now famous Purple Shoe!Yes you did!  And we hope to bring in more colors too.  When we reach $95.000  in total funding we will add Orange and Lime. With your help we can get there!  We want to build an ethical earth conscious brand of footwear for active living. By doing so we not only provide great employment, but we reduce vast quantities of synthetics from entering the landfill. Chenna Baree is about the marriage of beauty, function and sustainability. We want to deliver to you a unique, highly functional shoe which will be made for many years to come.  That means, you will always want to have a pair in your active collection.   Becoming part of our support network is a choice that you will feel great about. We have gone to great lengths to realize this project. Learning Chinese has not been the least of it. We are excited and ready for production. We are confident that we can make deliveries by August 2017. It is only fair to say that unforeseen situations may arise. There may be delays either in production or shipping due to such circumstances. If there is a problem, we will be up front and communicative with our backers.Sizing is potentially a problem for some customers. We have provided the best information we can to help you choose the right size. If there is a problem, contact us and we will provide you with options.There have been cases where campaigns have met with great difficulty when they have received many more supporters than expected. We are prepared to meet 3 times our  goal without anticipated delay. Beyond that, we anticipate that shipping would be delayed for an estimated 8 weeks to schedule additional production.",18.0,2,"1 Campaign

Having experience previously launching a crowdfunding campaign, we know how important it is to ensure that we are always 100% transparent with the campaign timeline. Our previous campaign for the Voyage Pillow shipped on-time for our backers (with some arriving earlier than promised!).
We have already taken the steps to ensure we stick to the below timeframe so you have your hands on the Voyage Bags as soon as possible. As always, if any delays occurring during the process we will outline them in our updates. We strive to be one of the best crowdfunding campaigns you have ever backed!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Marina Martinez and I recently graduated California State University Monterey Bay. During my last semester there, my classmates and I in the Cinematic Arts and Technology department created short films about Fort Ord and collected veteran stories for the Library of Congress. Our student short films have been compiled into a compilation entitled<i> Fort Ord: A Sense of Place</i>. This compilation will be screened at the Smithsonian National Gallery of Art on March 18th 2017, we will also be presenting the veteran stories we collected to the Library of congress On March 17th 2017. I am hoping to raise enough money for my travel expense so that I will be able to attend all the events on March 17th and 18th. A short film that I did with three other students is called <i>Every GI Is A POW .</i></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Breakdown of Expenses</h3>
<ul>
<li>The current cheapest roundtrip ticket from San Francisco to Washington D.C. is around $400, as it gets closer to March, the ticket prices will go up.</li>
<li>A cheap hotel room is around $200 a night in the area of Washington D.C. I will be staying in. I will need to stay a minimum of three nights, possibly 4 depending on flight options (cheaper connecting flights are around 8hrs long). </li>
<li>Food</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am going to be straight with you, I currently live paycheck to paycheck and stick to a budgeting plan so that all my bills get paid on time. That being said I don't have a lot of leeway with money when opportunities like this present themselves. I never thought a short film that I was a part of would screen at the Smithsonian National Gallery of Art or that I would be invited to go to Washington D.C. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity/experience and because of that I have to try and not let money be the reason I can't attend these events.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>This is our seventh crowdfunding campaign, we've learned a lot throughout our last five campaigns - not to mention the last 9 years of business ;). We like to think that we're getting better and better at what we do. As with tackling anything new, we know there will be challenges along the way, we know there will be set backs, but rest assured we never slow down - not even a little. We're 115% pedal to the metal kinda company that doesn't take no for an answer.</p>
<p>There are a few items that could challenge us and our time line.<br/>1) Power Packs, we've already done the development for these so that's a huge plus for this campaign! We know there will be many unforeseen challenges when we move to final production, but we're brave and ready to face them!<br/>2) Fabric, this is the second longest lead item in our supply chain and if the produced fabric does not meet our high quality control specifications it will have to be redone. This could cause an unforeseen delay.<br/>3) Shipping around the world always presents risk, we source from several suppliers around the world and our logistics web is quite complex - so there's always potential for crazy unexpected delays at home or abroad. PLEASE NOTE, ALL CUSTOMS / DUTIES IN YOUR COUNTRY ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY - THIS IS OUT OF OUR HANDS. Sometimes international shipments experience unforeseen delays that are out of our control.<br/>4) If we add-on any new products during this campaign, we could experience delays.<br/>5) If we receive a monstrosity of backers (awesome) we could experience a slight delay, however we do feel confident in our supply chain and it's scalability.</p>
<p>We are partnered with ""Best in Industry"" suppliers and manufacturers that not only represent high quality products but they also mirror our values as a company in 'better than fair' labor and excellent employee conditions. We put boots on the ground in all of the facilities we work with, inspecting the entire process of our products - ensuring most importantly that people are treated with respect, dignity, and fairness.</p>
<p>Please note that we are a small company and we are dependent on several other companies staying in business and doing their job well - so with the launch of new products we sure do appreciate your patience! Our policy is honesty, transparency, and customer service in every aspect of our business. You make this happen and we will do everything we can to exceed your expectations, serve you, and equip you for adventure! Thanks for joining us!</p>

Hate being cold? Us too. So, instead of continuing to fight with bulky layers, we decided to make a lightweight, heated jacket that's 10X more powerful than its competitors - that's heat you can ACTUALLY FEEL!

 

 

 
Tired of BULKY LAYERS? Ember gives you the warmth of multiple layers without all the bulk, thanks to it's high energy heat!    
 

 

Ember comes as both a half-zip pullover or a full-zip hooded jacket. Both provide instant heat and incredible comfort and are powered by our industry-leading, 60-watt, USBC-PD power packs! 
Plus, Ember is available in a male and female-specific fit to ensure you find the perfect match for your body type.
 

 

 


 

Finally, a heated jacket that delivers on instant heat that you can actually feel! Check out the video below to learn more about how we took a cue from Apple and other big players in the tech industry and invested in USB-C PD.

 

 

 

 

 

 

You want to warm up, not break a sweat. So, we built in breathability where you need it most! High-stretch, high-flow grid fleece flow vents on the back and under the arms allow excess heat to escape — BEFORE you break a sweat. 

 

 
 

 

Ember features a windproof and water-resistant nylon exterior to keep moisture at bay when your adventures get more ""adventurous.""  

 
Plus, waterproof heat panels and an IP65 rated Power Pack means that Ember stays warm and protected in even the heaviest downpour! 
 

 

 

 
Inside of Ember, natural bamboo fibers and the “supermaterial” graphene join forces to create an insulating dream-team.
The bamboo fibers naturally draw sweat away from your body — keeping you warmer, longer. Plus, bamboo’s incredible antimicrobial properties repel odors and keep your jacket stink-free! 
 

Then there’s graphene… a natural thermal conductor that springs to life when the heat panels are activated. Simply put, instead of relying on the centralized heat from the core panels, graphene absorbs the warmth and conducts it throughout the entire jacket keeping you warm all over. 

With instant heat at the push of a button, Ember reduces or completely removes the need for bulky layers — no matter where you decide to wear it!

<p>My teacher always says, ""Point your mind in a positive, useful direction"". The symbols and all the elements that make up the designs have a resonance that aligns you with your higher nature. The idea is that just by looking at them, you are pointing your mind in a positive, useful direction.</p>
<p>Research shows that visual imagery is processed 60,000 times faster than text. When you surround yourself with positive uplifting imagery, you program your mind for success. My intention is that these yoga mats truly support and inspire you in your practice and your life. </p>

We're truly grateful for the trust and support you gave us back then.</p><p>After a messy weekend of celebrating the success of our last goggle campaign, we challenged ourselves once again: to launch a new high-quality goggle that looks amazing, and comes with our new high-quality lens that puts them right up amongst the top players in the market. But at half the price (at least) - and at the same time keeping it true to our cause of ensuring the clean-up of 2 kg of plastic waste from the Pacific Ocean pr. product sold. </p><p>Quite a challenge, yes -  however after countless hours back in the lab as well as testing on- and off the slopes, we're now confident that we've done it again! </p><p> </p><h3>We give you, the Inuit goggles with two new lens technologies: XE2 and XEp</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578300500/o03aebav8kmbnfnllwcb.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>In case you don't know us yet, we're all about high-quality and great design wrapped in affordable prices.

They provide a high-contrast view, and the violet base secures enhanced color recognition unveiling details normally invisible for the naked eye. With an XE2 lens, contrast-enhancing dyes are added to fine-tune the light spectrum and thereby increase contrasts and reduce glare, developed explicitly for snow sport and mountain conditions.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574871631/qpuliugqxri5hedqmvrp.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The XE2 is one of the best High Contrast lenses on the market and most affordable... You will not believe it before you try it!</p><p> </p><h3>The XEp lens: High Contrast and Photochromic</h3><p>The XEp lens is a photochromic version of the XE2 lens, meaning it adapts to any weather condition, automatically. The lens reacts to a combination of sunlight and UV-rays, resulting in photochromic molecules constantly recalibrate as the light changes. This causes the lenses to darken in only up to 20 seconds when it is sunny and vise versa then the sun disappears. During these rapid transitions, full UV400 protection is guaranteed. We've manufactured the lens with a patented molded-in film technology, which ensures the highest optical quality, uniformed color change as well as weather resistance. </p><p>Check out the video below where the Danish national ski team coach -Frederik Højgaard - demonstrate the XEp lens.</p><div>

However, as a small start-up, we're doing what we can to spread awareness about the challenges as hopefully inspire other companies to follow. To date our program 1=2 has resulted in 125 tons being collected from the Pacific beaches in Colombia. Of course this campaign is also part of our 1=2 program, meaning for every product we sell, we'll make sure that 2 kg of plastic waste is collected from the Pacific ocean.</p><p>If you want to know more about our program please see the below video and check out our website: <a href=""http://%C2%A0https://messyweekend.com/pages/clean-the-ocean%C2%A0%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http:// https://messyweekend.com/pages/clean-the-ocean  </a></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_z7xrhkm0ds?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><h2>What did our previous backers say? &lt;3</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574795315/ik7eijykia8iuapvno8e.png"" src=""""/></p><h2> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574789586/wltz1favvusnx2fncon6.png"" src=""""/>

To celebrate the campaign we went on a messy weekend in the snow. After breaking/loosing our veeeery expensive goggles from  *biiib*, *biiib* and *biiib*, we started planning the launch our FLOAT goggle.

We're truly grateful for the trust and support you gave us back then.After a messy weekend of celebrating the success of our last goggle campaign, we challenged ourselves once again: to launch a new high-quality goggle that looks amazing, and comes with our new high-quality lens that puts them right up amongst the top players in the market. But at half the price (at least) - and at the same time keeping it true to our cause of ensuring the clean-up of 2 kg of plastic waste from the Pacific Ocean pr. product sold. Quite a challenge, yes -  however after countless hours back in the lab as well as testing on- and off the slopes, we're now confident that we've done it again!  We give you, the Inuit goggles with two new lens technologies: XE2 and XEp In case you don't know us yet, we're all about high-quality and great design wrapped in affordable prices. The Inuit is exactly that.Check out GloboSurf's Review about us. The XE2 lens: High ContrastThe easy interchangeable XE2-lens is an improvement of our XE1 lens. The dual-layered lens is manufactured of a grade 1 optical quality polycarbonate, which makes them both thin, light-weight, and practically unbreakable. They provide a high-contrast view, and the violet base secures enhanced color recognition unveiling details normally invisible for the naked eye. With an XE2 lens, contrast-enhancing dyes are added to fine-tune the light spectrum and thereby increase contrasts and reduce glare, developed explicitly for snow sport and mountain conditions.The XE2 is one of the best High Contrast lenses on the market and most affordable... You will not believe it before you try it! The XEp lens: High Contrast and PhotochromicThe XEp lens is a photochromic version of the XE2 lens, meaning it adapts to any weather condition, automatically. The lens reacts to a combination of sunlight and UV-rays, resulting in photochromic molecules constantly recalibrate as the light changes. This causes the lenses to darken in only up to 20 seconds when it is sunny and vise versa then the sun disappears. During these rapid transitions, full UV400 protection is guaranteed. We've manufactured the lens with a patented molded-in film technology, which ensures the highest optical quality, uniformed color change as well as weather resistance. Check out the video below where the Danish national ski team coach -Frederik Højgaard - demonstrate the XEp lens.

 
 Complete package with everything you needAll packages will be delivered with a complete package of everything you need for any condition.The XE2 package includes:
MW frame
MW strap with anti-slip
Inuit XE2 high-contrast lens
1 extra overcast/snow-lens
2 x microfiber pouches
1 x hard box
 The XEp package includes:
MW frame
MW strap with anti-slip
Inuit XEp Photochromic high-contrast lens
1 x microfiber pouches
1 x hard box
  The Inuit frame is manufactured of a lightweight TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) which is both extremely flexible and durable while ensuring an excellent fit for all faces and helmets. The foam technology is triple-layered to ensure airflow for preventing fogging and comfort.  The straps are easily interchangeable meaning you can change the look of the entire goggle in just two clicks. To ensure an even fresher look, we've used a matt-finish silicone for the logos. Also, the straps are fitted with triple silicone linings to prevent unwanted slipping.  The limited-edition pro straps are inspired by our hero and icon Glen Plake - the godfather of freestyle. You'll easily recognize the same 80's vibe in these straps as you get from our home shopping theme in the video.All current packages will be shipping in February.  PLASTIC CLEAN UP As with our previous campaign and our everyday business, plastic clean-up is fundamental to us. When we started MessyWeekend, it was clear that we needed to give back in one way or another. We're not saving the planet with our 1=2 program. However, as a small start-up, we're doing what we can to spread awareness about the challenges as hopefully inspire other companies to follow. To date our program 1=2 has resulted in 125 tons being collected from the Pacific beaches in Colombia. Of course this campaign is also part of our 1=2 program, meaning for every product we sell, we'll make sure that 2 kg of plastic waste is collected from the Pacific ocean.If you want to know more about our program please see the below video and check out our website: http:// https://messyweekend.com/pages/clean-the-ocean   What did our previous backers say? <3 
The teamPresenting us - the MW team - at your service. As you see, it's us in the videos as well. No actors (obviously...). Just us. Back in February 2018, we launched MessyWeekend sunglasses with the help from almost 1000 amazing backers. To celebrate the campaign we went on a messy weekend in the snow. After breaking/loosing our veeeery expensive goggles from  *biiib*, *biiib* and *biiib*, we started planning the launch our FLOAT goggle. Thanks to the support and trust we received from our 4.634 backers, the campaign broke all records. Today we're selling our sunglasses and snow goggles, globally. However, even though the business is fantastic, we're still at a (financial) stage where we need support launching our next goggle adventure: the Inuit!

The integrated bag, it takes just 5 sec to put the jacket into the bag !  family@movacyclingjacket.com

Macey Sherman, London
Julie Plichon & Josh Chesterfield in Hampstead Heath, London
When we were doing prototypes ! We made some small changes since then. For exemple we only use the two triangles instead of the full MOVA ! 


 Comfort: the hood is compatible with the bike helmet

• Avoid the sweat: two opening pockets allow you to commute and move on your bike, breathe without sweating.
Comfort: The hood is hidden in the jacket's collar. Use it when you need it.
 Comfort: You will stop losing your keys thanks to this little pocket.
Comfort: The jacket is slightly longer at the back to prevent your trousers to get wet.
Be seen: The jacket is perfect to be seen by car drivers, night and day !

Carry your stuff: A big back pocket is available to put a book, or a tablet. It is the same integrated bag that transforms into a back pocket !

<p><strong>What kinds of pet hair does MANTA work on?</strong></p>
<p>MANTA works well on most types of dog, cat and even ferret hair. It does not work very well on thick, short (less than 2cm/0.8 inches) hairs, such as dalmatian and pug.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Things to know when using MANTA</strong></p>
<p>In rare cases, the surface of MANTA may become slightly rough and not gather pet hair as well as it should. If this happens, use the included sandpaper to file down the rough spots.</p>
<p>There are times when static electricity may make pet hair stick to MANTA, during the winter for example. If this occurs, simply use a spray bottle to lightly mist the surface of MANTA with water before using.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we need </strong></p>
<p> The design for MANTA is basically finished, now we just have to get it into production. We need a certain number of orders in order to do this.

<p>Local Craftsman and Master Woodworkers handcraft wooden water skis into beautiful longboards we call 'Island Rollers'. Each ski is strip down carefully to expose the raw wood. We then treat it with waterproofing agent and polish to protect it and bring out the natural beauty. We apply our simple graphics, Gullwing trucks, Abec bearings and premium wheels to make this the smoothest and by far the attention grabbingest board you will ever ride!</p>
<p> They are great for anyone needing a mode of transportation, whether be across campus or down the street. Island Rollers naturally keep momentum more so than a tyipcal longboard because or the extra thickness of the deck and therefore require less pumping once moving along.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 10px; font-weight: normal;"">Island Rollers are different. They have a unique look. and they are 58"" long - thats more than a foot longer than even the 'long' boards! And - because of the size - we have a lot of friends that use them for stand up paddling on sidewalks. As my friend Aravind described them: ""I go on rides and in half an hour I will have touched my feet to the pavement 2, maybe 3 times tops. I cant always lug my SUP board to the water but with IR [Island Rollers] I can still get a good core workout while still being outside""</span></h3>
<p><strong>How will you use the funds?</strong></p>
<p>Costs to produce each board are very high. At this moment, I make boards for myself, friends, family etc. because I enjoy it. I have only recently thought this to be an opportunity to start something so that I can share these with others. My goal is to use the money to do a run of 15 Island Rollers and use this inventory to jumpstart sales as well as to showcase the boards in a few of the local skate &amp; surf shops in my area. The decks are the most expensive facet of producing these boards. It is not as cost effective to buy a ski and then pay a craftsman to strip it down and revitalize it. So in order to negotiate pricing, I need to do multiple decks. If I can drive this cost down, I can make the pricing competitive with the household brands but still offer a product that makes the mass produced boards seem like a piece of plywood with castor wheels on it! In addition to the decks, I need the initial infusion of cash to also purchase minimums from manufacturers for the trucks, bearings, wheels, hardware and graphics. I have been cashflowing these out of pocket for some time now so ANY outside funding is a great start!</p>

</div></div>","Hello to all your Race fans, I'm Joey Licata Jr.



I'm aiming to make my mark in the NASCAR world. I have raced Karts from the time I was 9 years old with the ultimate goal to be one of the sports top drivers.

When I was 15, I started racing stock cars. That was the point I knew I was destined to race cars.

I ran the ASA Speed Truck Challenge in 2009 and won the points championship, and followed that up in 2010 with back to back Championships. I also raced NASCAR Late Models and NASCAR Grand American Modifieds. A full list of my wins are listed on my website.
Also in 2010 I was given the opportunity to test in an ARCA car for Cunningham Motorsports.
The test went so well I was offered to drive for them in the 2011 ARCA Racing Series. 



In February I placed 6th in my 1st race at the Daytona International Speedway.

This all costs money! 
Up until now my parents and family have help fund my way.
The series is continuing, but with out me. I have missed the last few months of races.
I need your help to continue my racing journey, till sponsors come on board.

The money raised here will go toward: entry fees, tires, travel, and payroll for the guys 
for the last 2 races of the season:
Kansas Speedway Oct 7
Toledo Speedway Oct 16

Spread the word from me. I'm even offering Perks!
I know I've got what it takes. I just need to get back in the race car and post some more wins!
 
Thank you for your supportJoey",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>A nostalgic snapshot of the New York
or Chicago jazz scene? </p>
<p>Nope – this was San Francisco’s
Fillmore District in its musical heyday. </p>
<p>In the 1940s and 1950s, the Fillmore
was a swinging, eclectic, and integrated neighborhood. Its streets were lit up
with lively restaurants, packed theaters, busy pool halls, and eclectic shops –
many minority owned. Within one square mile, it boasted two dozen active
nightclubs and music joints that thrived for decades until it virtually
vanished – abruptly and thoroughly – in one of the largest redevelopment
projects in the U.S. Its memory – held by those who lived and played music in
the district – is now also in danger of being lost.</p>
<p>Our project, <i><b>Harlem of the West,</b></i> is a book, website, and traveling museum
exhibit that will preserve and bring back to life the Fillmore's rich musical and
cultural history. We are delighted to have newly discovered photographs and
memorabilia, as well as audio interviews with those who lived and played in the
Fillmore at the height of its glory. <i><b>Harlem
of the West</b></i> celebrates this unique and rediscovered chapter in jazz history
and the African American experience on the West Coast.</p>
<p>We are asking for $20,000 which will just cover the cost of the book, but the reality is that if we want to do the entire project -- book, website, and exhibit -- we need to raise $40,116.63. So getting the word out and trying to double our goal is critical.</p>
<p>To date, very little has been known
about this remarkable community and its role in development of California’s
unique culture. Most historical societies and archives didn’t think to collect
materials about this multicultural community. Yet more than seventy years after
the first African American jazz nightclub opened in the neighborhood, many
elements of the Fillmore are receiving renewed interest. Its multiethnic
residents fascinate. Its jazz, blues, and rhythm and blues musical history set
the bar for decades to follow. Its precedence-setting court case, which
profoundly changed the nation’s post-war drive to redevelop, is an untold
chapter significant to California and U.S. history.</p>
<p>The <b><i>Harlem of the West</i> <i>Project</i> </b>seeks
to bring the Fillmore back to life in a book filled with rarely seen
photographs and stories from those who lived through the Fillmore's musical
heyday. We will also build a multimedia website so that anyone around
the world can hear the entire recorded interviews of each person in the book,
plus view photographs and additional stories of the neighborhood. Finally,
we’ll launch a traveling museum exhibit based on the book and website,
accessible to schools, community centers, museums, and other interested groups
both nationally and internationally.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2006, Chronicle Books published
our first book, “<b>Harlem of the West: The San Francisco Fillmore Jazz Era.</b>” We
launched a tiny website and exhibit created from the materials gathered
for that early book. Unfortunately after two pressings, the book was put out of
print, although there was, and continues to be, a large demand. </p>
<p>Within weeks of that book’s release,
people began contacting us with insider information about the book’s photographs,
offering new stories and oral histories, as well as additional images and
artifacts. Many of those who lived the history are elderly; it’s crucial that
we document their stories before they pass. We have also received countless
inquiries from educators, historians, researchers, those from the neighborhood,
and from around the state and the world, clamoring for access to both existing
and new materials. We need additional financial resources to gather these new
materials and create a much larger – and more accessible – Fillmore cultural history
repository, and release a more robust version of the earlier book. </p>
<p>We are actively seeking funds to complete
this project: to interview new subjects who have offered us interviews, to
collect their photos and memorabilia, and to research their relevance to the
neighborhood. We need to archive and scan new photographs and materials, edit
audio and text versions of all the oral histories, and upload the oral
histories and new photographs and materials to the website to make them
accessible to international audience interested in the subject. We need funds
to create new updated e- and print versions of the book. We also seek
additional funds to create a new <b><i>Harlem
of the West</i> </b>museum exhibit so that it can travel to venues throughout the
state, to the East Coast, and to Europe. </p>
<p>We have a list of more than 50
diverse interview subjects from a variety of backgrounds and viewpoints who
have asked to be part of the oral history recordings. Because of financial and
time constraints, we will prioritize the oldest individuals, whose stories
about the neighborhood have not yet been told. We will select new photographs
and materials in a similar way, with scanning and restoring priority given to
images of people and locations not yet included in the project.</p>
<p></p>
</div><h3><b>The Impact</b></h3><div> <p></p>
</div><div>
<p>The <b><i>Harlem of the West</i> </b>Project targets a general audience of all ages, especially
but not limited to anyone interested in American musical and cultural history, African
American history, and both urban and community development. Susan
Goldstein, head of the San Francisco Public Library History Center, reports
that their small Fillmore history collection is one of the most heavily used by
researchers around the nation and internationally, demonstrating the hunger for
material about this neighborhood. </p>
<p>The HOTW Project will enhance our
understanding of how and why, beginning in the late 1800s, this diverse
neighborhood came to be, how it grew through African American migration, and
how it boomed almost overnight during World War II.  It tells the story of
how people build communities, how they thrive, and how they may decline, if not
protected.  In an era in which our cities and neighborhoods are under
economic stress, it is enormously valuable to learn from decisions made by
often well-intentioned city planners, politicians, and citizens, so that
today’s communities can find promising solutions, embedded in our previously
forgotten cultural history.</p>

<p><b><i>Elizabeth Pepin Silva</i></b> is a writer, photographer, and filmmaker. Her interest in the Fillmore began when Bill Graham hired her as Historian and Day Manager of the Fillmore Auditorium in 1986. Her short booklet for Graham on the history of the Fillmore Auditorium began her research into the district and its music scene. Elizabeth has written about the neighborhood for magazines and newspapers, and was historian and writer for the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency's Fillmore Sidewalk and Plaza Project, as well as the Fillmore Center's Fillmore Historical Panel Project. Her photographs have been exhibited in museums and galleries including Yerba Buena Center for the Arts and the San Jose Museum, as well as in five books on women's surfing. Elizabeth’s first book as an author, “Harlem of the West: The San Francisco Fillmore Jazz Era,” was published by Chronicle Books in 2006.

Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase, NY; Smithsonian Institution, Washington,
D.C.; The Oakland Museum of California; The Studio Museum in Harlem, NY; and
the California Historical Society, among other places. His work concentrates on
examining the cultural landscape in Harlem, West Oakland, South Central Los
Angeles, New Orleans and other parts of the African Diaspora. He is interested
in traces of history, cultural expression, spiritual belief and
contemporary experience found in the environment as well as those who leave the
traces. Much of his work is informed by his own experience of being
Southern-born but raised on the West Coast. This has led to an interest in the
connection between the South and North in terms of cultural artifacts and
customs brought during the African American migration in the mid-20<sup>th</sup>
century, and the ways that the landscape and people in both regions reflect
those influences.</p>

</div></div>","Turning DC travelers into cycling VIPs!
Cycling is my passion. DC is my city. Becoming the DC Cycling Concierge is not just a new business — it’s an extension of my longtime work to share the benefits and joys of bicycling. Cycling is booming in cities across the United States — and
there’s no better place to ride than the nation’s capitol. Each year,
Washington D.C. gets more than 20 million visitors eager to explore the city,
whether traveling for business or pleasure. As a local cyclist, I know the most
memorable way to experience DC is from the saddle, so I started thinking: What
if there was a service that made that experience quick, convenient and, most of
all, fun? 
That’s how DC Cycling Concierge got rolling.Whether serious road riders, triathletes in training or more casual cyclists, people who ride want to get in some miles without worrying
about missing the best routes, getting lost or being dumped onto unsafe roads. They want to see the
sites on their own schedule at their own pace rather than being confined to a
pre-packed group tour with people riding a different pace. They want to get off the beaten path and see why the District
is consistently highlighted as one of the best places to bike. 
The DC Cycling Concierge will serve that niche — but
growing — market by offering custom, guided tours in the Washington, D.C.
region. With a few details on a rider’s desires and goals, I’ll show up at the
customer’s hotel or door ready to roll on a route tailored to meet their specific needs.
My motto: Your Ride, Your Pace. 

What makes me a Cycling Concierge? I'm a national cycling expert with 20 years as an executive leading the charge for better biking. I want each customer to have the best possible experience on a bike. I’ve been fortunate to have
biked across this great country and more than 20 others around the world. As a
DC local, I ride every single day, whether running errands, chauffeuring my foster kids in our family's cargo bike, or getting out on to the back roads of the beautiful
countryside around DC for a cycling adventure or training ride. From adventure cyclist and triathlete to bike safety expert training trainers, teachers and police, if it is related to biking, I know about it.
I’ve gotten the inside scoop from area hosts and experts, as well. From
hotel concierges to DC’s premier bike rental business, this idea has been met
with excitement. After all, most visitors come to the nation’s capital from
March to October, overlapping perfectly with the best months to bike. And those
visitors — 700,000 hotel rooms per month — contribute nearly $7 billion
per year to our local economy! 


Delivering priceless experiences.  
So what’s it 
cost?  Less than a good bottle of wine.

Fully customized rides cost $249 for one to four riders for the first 2 hours of riding time. Questionnaire, planning, preparation, and follow up included.

Unfortunately, we do not ship to every country in the world. Due to logistical reasons we are unable to efficiently ship to every country. If your country is not listed as a country that we ship to, we suggest you find a freight forwarder or freight consolidator that specializes in shipping to your country. If you have any questions about this process, feel free to reach out to us.
SHIPPING POLICY
If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and the package returns to our warehouse (either because you’re not there, the wrong address was provided, or you moved without telling us), it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package.",25.0,0,"8 Campaigns

<p><strong>DropMyStuff.com will be what ""My Yahoo"" should have been.</strong></p>
<p>If you are anything like me, I have over a dozen social media sites I monitor, several news sites I like to visit, a bunch of video and photo websites I keep up with and at least three email addresses I log into daily.</p>
<p>What if I could avoid clicking multiple tabs, bookmarks and drop down menus to get access to my favorite sites? What if I could just go to one place and have all my favorite stuff load up in a very useful way?</p>
<p>DropMyStuff.com will streamline all your sites and organize them the way you want them.</p>

<p>As software designer for BellSouth and AT&amp;T, I was able to create software that was enjoyed by millions of customers. Products such as:</p>
<p><strong>• AT&amp;T U-Verse</strong> <br/>I was one of the first people in the world to design and develop apps for the iPhone. I designed a highly usable touch-screen interface with a focus on minimalism and stunning visuals for the AT&amp;T U-Verse Digital TV services. I also conceptualized, designed and developed the interface for the set-top box applications.</p>
<p><strong>• BellSouth.net News Portal</strong><br/>Managed creative development and production of online content for the BellSouth.net News Portal (websites, video, games, activities, third party advertisements and promotions). Managed an internal team of associate producers, designers, illustrators, animators and web developers in an exciting fast-paced production environment.</p>
<p><strong>• BellSouth Media Player</strong><br/>GUI design work and functional prototypes.</p>
<p><strong>• BellSouth Instant Messenger</strong><br/>Determined instructional strategies, design solutions and provided support in development.</p>
<p><strong>• BellSouth Video Chat</strong><br/>Responsible for a variety of tasks including user experience design, visual design and usability testing.</p>

</div></div>","DropMyStuff.com will be a FREE to use website that will help you manage all your favorite websites.
DropMyStuff.com will be what ""My Yahoo"" should have been.
If you are anything like me, I have over a dozen social media sites I monitor, several news sites I like to visit, a bunch of video and photo websites I keep up with and at least three email addresses I log into daily.
What if I could avoid clicking multiple tabs, bookmarks and drop down menus to get access to my favorite sites? What if I could just go to one place and have all my favorite stuff load up in a very useful way?
DropMyStuff.com will streamline all your sites and organize them the way you want them.
Here's a DEMO.





.........................................................................................................................................

Create ""Playlists"" of your favorite sites. I want one just for my social media, one playlist for work and one for when I'm home. One click loads the sites I want, wherever I'm at and whenever I want.



Get real time ""News Feeds"" and see what all your friends and contacts are sharing all over the web. Get emails, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter updates and more! All in one place, all in real time.



Customize your dashboard by moving your sites to your desired locations. Choose from several wallpapers or create your own to complete your look. You can SAVE multiple playlists, settings and looks.
Here's a DEMO.
.........................................................................................................................................

I've built a DEMO. I’ve figured out how the software part of the website is going to work efficiently and the best ways to make it user friendly. I will continue working with brilliant programmers, designers, system administrators and focus groups to make this website a very special experience.
I need your help to take the next step. I'm looking for funds to put DropMyStuff.com into production.

Here’s the breakdown of how the money will be spent:


$125,000: Staff Salaries - 4 people for 12 weeks (2 Software Programmers, Web Designer and Graphic Artist)

$25,000: Equipment

$20,000: QA Testing

$20,000: Manufacturing and Shipping Physical Rewards

$10,000: IndieGoGo and Payment Processing Fees

I know what I'm doing; I've led the design and development of over a dozen software products for many Fortune 500 companies, such as AT&T, IBM, Lockhead Martin, HP and many others. So, I know exactly what's required to pull this off.
View My Reel 2013 >>

You are getting in early on a very useful and cool product that will be used by many, many people. And, best of all, you will forever be known with helping make this project possible.
I'm asking you to help me make DropMyStuff.com a reality.
Thank you,

</p><h3><b><span><h3>ABOUT THE ZipSpa</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The ZipSpa is the only portable, collapsible indoor or outdoor pet washing device.  The ZipSpa is an animal's personal bathing unit where the animal is in a self-contained, stationery device where clean water is dispensed much like that of a human shower.  Likewise, used water is extracted and easily disposed into a drain.</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>ZipSpa allows pet owners to wash their pet at home without the mess of cleaning a sink or bathtub, especially when water splatters after a pet shakes from being wet.  For pet groomers, it can serve as a mobile pet washing device that fits into a car trunk and can be taken to various locations.</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The ZipSpa creates an environment where a pet owner or groomer can wash animals and maintain a clean living or working environment.  Because it is collapsible and has wheels, it can be easily stored and transported even if you are on the road traveling by car or RV (recreational vehicle).  The ZipSpa is also convenient for cleaning a pet when outside weather is inclement and your pet is still in need of being bathed.</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>ZipSpa was created after my kids and I brought home a pet, and my wife did not want to compromise the cleanliness of our home.  Being an engineer in the field of product development, I researched products to see what could be used to bathe pets.  After no success with finding a product on the market, in order to have peace at home, I became charged with creating a solution, hence the ZipSpa.<br/>

<p>Even the falling egg doesn't crack! That's because the gas in the seat cushion is <strong>evenly</strong> distributed in the airbag.

<h3>What makes NOMAD<u><i>Z</i></u> different? </h3>
<ol>
<li>First and foremost, NOMAD<u><i>Z</i></u> differentiates itself by the fact that we are solely aimed at university students, and young adults.</li>
<li>Unlike traditional websites that need travel information before getting to work, the NOMAD<u><i>Z</i></u> website offers the ability to recommend different travel recommendations based simply on your personal preferances. And if you have a specific destination, date, or length in mind - we offer that option as well.</li>
<li> As NOMAD<u><i>Z</i></u> accumulates travel data from other sources, we have identified 9 key elements that we believe are most important to consider for anyone in our generation before they embark on their travel. For every destination that you explore, the NOMAD<u><i>Z</i></u> website will offer you the ability to easily view these 9 elements: <i>Flights &amp; Transportation, Accommodation, Budgeting, Traveler Tips, Things to Do &amp; Guides, Culture &amp; Cuisine, Media &amp; Highlights, Visas/Safety/Health, Group Travel</i>.</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have the website prototype ready for development. We need your help to build the website, and bring our vision into reality. The funds raised through this campaign will go towards hiring an expert developer who will write the code, in order to create the functionally interactive website we have established in our prototype. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to make traveling easy and personal, by providing a free tool for anyone who has a dream to see the world. Traveling changes us - it helps us understand that together, we are part of something greater: a global community.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>As a university student, I understand that I do not have the same experiences as a seasoned entrepreneur. However, as the founder I am also part of the market that we are aiming to reach. Because of this, I am able to put myself in the shoes of the consumer to help understand what our generation needs. Even though being young may provide its challenges, I also believe it is one of the greatest assets I have. As a student, I am surrounded by a vast amount of experienced entrepreneurs, and professors who have supported me throughout this journey. So even if I do not have the experience or knowledge myself, I can assure you that I am in good hands.</p></div><div>

Every time I lose something, I spend 20 minutes looking for my keys only to find them hiding in the most obvious place, possible - usually in yesterday's jeans or under the couch cushion.      That's why we invented TrackR, a simple way to keep track of items using your smartphone. After 5 years of R&D, thousands of customer feature suggestions, and 5 product revisions, we are proud to reveal TrackR bravo to the world.  TrackR bravo is the most elegant item tracking device ever created backed by the world's largest Crowd GPS network.Questions? Talk to us!

No Problem.    Many phones have been eaten by couch cushions. Press the button on TrackR bravo to cause your phone to ring...and it works even on silent mode. Track it down. From anywhere  If an item goes missing, TrackR's Crowd GPS network will help you find it.  When another user of the TrackR app comes within 100ft range of your lost item, you will receive a GPS update of where your item is.  The World's Largest Crowd GPS Network    Because the TrackR app is built to track any Bluetooth device or Bluetooth tracker device, it's no surprise we have the world's largest Crowd GPS network with over 1,000,000 item updates per day! See Crowd GPS in action:    Design Driven Product  We took a different approach with TrackR bravo.

Keep track of things at the water park, by the pool, at the beach, or at the lake.  TrackR App                                        Keep your items at your fingertips When Chris and Christian first came up with the idea of TrackR, they envisioned transferring the entire ""database of items in our head"" to our phones, just like your phonebook (remember how you used to know your best friend's phone number?). The TrackR app is focused on achieving that vision so you let the app keep track of your items for you.  With the app design, we tried to simplify the entire user interface by enabling users to access core functions as quickly as possible. It's of course packed with features:

<p>...the worlds 1st action sports resort.</p>
<p>Now we need your help to build our second one in Costa Rica!</p>
<h2>The Surf Ranch Resort and how it was found.</h2>
One cold December night back in 2008 in Kelowna, BC, Canada, after work, 19 and 21 year old brothers Lucas &amp; Travis Boychuk decided to pick up a case of beer after work and chill in their parents hot tub. The discussion started with buying islands and ended with buying land in a foreign country.        <br/>                 <br/>They brought out the laptop and looked up islands for sale around the world. As the search went on, islands seemed to be out of the question, so they decided to type in ""cheap land for sale"" on Google. Phillipines and Nicaragua came up. They decided to book 2 return tickets to Nicaragua that week...as it was closer than the Phillipines.        <br/>             <br/>So off to Nicaragua they went. They found themselves doing the same thing that every backpacker does when they travel...explore. They spent the 2 week trip, exploring, partying and having fun.

We started with this piece of land (purchased from our gas station jobs)...

and turned it into this....

...the worlds 1st action sports resort.
Now we need your help to build our second one in Costa Rica!
The Surf Ranch Resort and how it was found.
One cold December night back in 2008 in Kelowna, BC, Canada, after work, 19 and 21 year old brothers Lucas & Travis Boychuk decided to pick up a case of beer after work and chill in their parents hot tub. The discussion started with buying islands and ended with buying land in a foreign country.                         They brought out the laptop and looked up islands for sale around the world. As the search went on, islands seemed to be out of the question, so they decided to type in ""cheap land for sale"" on Google. Phillipines and Nicaragua came up. They decided to book 2 return tickets to Nicaragua that week...as it was closer than the Phillipines.                     So off to Nicaragua they went. They found themselves doing the same thing that every backpacker does when they travel...explore. They spent the 2 week trip, exploring, partying and having fun. The 2 weeks went faster than they thought. It was the day before they had to go home that they realized that they didn't really look at much land. After walking down the street of San Juan Del Sur, they met a local contractor from California that overheard them talking and stated...""you guys speak english?"", as he was renovating an old building. That night the brothers went to go check out a 2 acre plot of land that his friend had for sale.        
 

             Lucas and Travis loved the piece of land for sale, and they put a $1000 deposit on it. The owner of the land made an agreement where they would pay the rest off over the course of a year. The brothers came back to Nicaragua 4 months later, rented a truck and toured the country, hired a lawyer, and did some work on the land. Over the next year, they worked like crazy at their jobs. Also during that year, they built a website and came up with a business plan on what they wanted to do with the land...to build the world's 1st action sports resort.                     ""To be honest with you, we had our doubts"", says Lucas, that was until he posted an ad on their local towns website...looking for investors for the project. Over the course of 1 month, they met up with 6 potential investors at a local starbucks, and they all wanted in. They only chose 2 investors from the bunch, and off they went.

<h3>Why This Book and Campaign?</h3>
After three Artist-in-Residencies, multiple Arizona Highways Photography Workshops groups I've led, and numerous personal visits to Acadia National Park in Maine, I feel this burning urge in my gut to run up to the top of Cadillac Mountain and yell at the top of my lungs so everyone in the world can hear, ""COME TO ACADIA!  COME TO ACADIA!!""<br/><br/>But to do so would violate ""Leave No Trace"" principles (and annoy a whole lot of people).  So I decided to write this book instead!

<p>Scheduled for publication in February 2014, my new guidebook, ""Photographing Acadia National Park:  The Essential Guide to When, Where, and How"" is my invitation to you to experience, enjoy, and photograph Maine's coastal gem through your own lens.  <br/></p>
<p><b><u>But I need your help!</u></b></p>
<p>By offering the book/eBook for pre-order sales and other exciting perks at a discount to my amazing community of valued supporters, <b><u>I'm hoping to raise $5,000 to help me cover the cost of printing the book.</u></b>  (Besides being the author and photographer of this book, I'm also the publisher - Analemma Press, LLC.)</p>
<p><img class=""fltlft lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/96374/files/20130925184815-Ride_with_Me_c.jpg?1380160095"" src="""" style=""width: 241.755px; height: 149px;""/></p>
<h3>What's This Book About?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Whether you are a beginning shutterbug, professional photographer, painter, or hiker interested in nature, wildlife, or history, this book will save you time and help you prepare for the photographic trip of a lifetime to Acadia National Park.  In short, I'm writing the book I wish I had for my visits to Acadia!<br/></p>

Jam-packed with priceless location-specific information, over 250 inspirational color photos, and instructional photography tips collected during my unmatched experiences as a three-time Artist-in-Residence in Acadia National Park, this invaluable guidebook reveals:
<ul>
<li>
<b>WHEN</b>:  Ideal times to photograph scenic vistas and intimate details based on lighting conditions and ephemeral seasonal events throughout the year (wildflowers, fall colors, &amp; wildlife migrations).</li>
<li>
<b>WHERE</b>:  50 can't-miss classic and lesser-known locations across Mount Desert Island, the Schoodic Peninsula, and Isle au Haut.</li>
<li>
<b>HOW</b>:  Recommended equipment and expert-level techniques to help you make stunning photographs at each suggested spot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also featuring an 18-page Photography Basics section, 12 insightful ""Behind the Photo"" stories, a Shoot Summary, and Recommended Itineraries, this book will <i><b>help you get in the right place at the right time</b></i> to create your very own treasured photographs from Acadia National Park!</p>
<p>I'm also producing an eBook (PDF) for download to your mobile devices with the same content plus interactive hyperlinks and maps included!</p>
<p>Here's a sample of a two-page spread for location #16 Boulder Beach from within the book:</p>

11/12/13:  WOW!!  We've surpassed our first stretch goal of $7,000, thanks to you! ALL funders/supporters that have already contributed or contribute prior to November 30, 2013 will now receive a FREE download of my ""Shot List Template"" (PDF) at the end of the campaign!  
Let's keep the momentum going with a NEW stretch goal!   If we achieve $8,000, I'll send contributors a free handout on the Recommended Restaurants and Lodging Listing around Acadia, in addition to the free PDF download of my Shot List Template.
11/1/13:  Thanks to you, we've met our original $5,000 goal in the first week!  But we'll continue to accept pre-orders through November 30, 2013...with new goals and new rewards!
We've set a new stretch goal to $7,000.  If we achieve this amount - and we're really close! - I'll send all campaign funders a FREE download of my Shot List Template (PDF) to help you record your ideas for photographs during the visualization process.  
As always, appreciate your support!
Why This Book and Campaign?
After three Artist-in-Residencies, multiple Arizona Highways Photography Workshops groups I've led, and numerous personal visits to Acadia National Park in Maine, I feel this burning urge in my gut to run up to the top of Cadillac Mountain and yell at the top of my lungs so everyone in the world can hear, ""COME TO ACADIA!  COME TO ACADIA!!""But to do so would violate ""Leave No Trace"" principles (and annoy a whole lot of people).  So I decided to write this book instead!

Scheduled for publication in February 2014, my new guidebook, ""Photographing Acadia National Park:  The Essential Guide to When, Where, and How"" is my invitation to you to experience, enjoy, and photograph Maine's coastal gem through your own lens.  
But I need your help!
By offering the book/eBook for pre-order sales and other exciting perks at a discount to my amazing community of valued supporters, I'm hoping to raise $5,000 to help me cover the cost of printing the book.  (Besides being the author and photographer of this book, I'm also the publisher - Analemma Press, LLC.)

What's This Book About?

Whether you are a beginning shutterbug, professional photographer, painter, or hiker interested in nature, wildlife, or history, this book will save you time and help you prepare for the photographic trip of a lifetime to Acadia National Park.  In short, I'm writing the book I wish I had for my visits to Acadia!

Jam-packed with priceless location-specific information, over 250 inspirational color photos, and instructional photography tips collected during my unmatched experiences as a three-time Artist-in-Residence in Acadia National Park, this invaluable guidebook reveals:


WHEN:  Ideal times to photograph scenic vistas and intimate details based on lighting conditions and ephemeral seasonal events throughout the year (wildflowers, fall colors, & wildlife migrations).

WHERE:  50 can't-miss classic and lesser-known locations across Mount Desert Island, the Schoodic Peninsula, and Isle au Haut.

HOW:  Recommended equipment and expert-level techniques to help you make stunning photographs at each suggested spot.

Also featuring an 18-page Photography Basics section, 12 insightful ""Behind the Photo"" stories, a Shoot Summary, and Recommended Itineraries, this book will help you get in the right place at the right time to create your very own treasured photographs from Acadia National Park!
I'm also producing an eBook (PDF) for download to your mobile devices with the same content plus interactive hyperlinks and maps included!
Here's a sample of a two-page spread for location #16 Boulder Beach from within the book:


What's in it For You:
To show our appreciation for your support, we're offering our book for pre-order purchase as well as numerous other perks at a discount.

We therefore designed the pockets on the bag so that we could keep our valuables in an easy-to-reach position, but also completely out of reach of criminals.</p><p>Both of us had also experienced theft several times while travelling, especially when we were surfing and had left our belongings on the beach.

<p>We'll do our very best to send your perks and we're confident 100% of our backers will receive their backpacks. According to Paypal requirements, we have added the following disclaimer:</p>

</div></div>","ALREADY MADE A CONTRIBUTION?Provide your shipping details HERE   Code 10 Backpacks are fully waterproof, making them perfect for outdoor activities, commuting and travel. The roll-down design is fast and easy to use and prevents water from entering at the top of the backpack.We've used a special TPU-Coated Fabric (PVC-free), which is 100% impenetrable to moisture. Rather than using a conventional stitching method, all seams on the bag are welded using a special high-frequency method, which makes the backpacks more durable and prevents any moisture leakage.  We designed the Code 10 Backpack to be theft-proof. The roll down design prevents pickpockets from accessing the main compartment of the backpack, and can be locked if necessary. If you're leaving the backpack unattended, the bag itself can be secured to almost any fixed object using the integrated steel wire and combination lock, making it impossible for opportunistic thieves to access your belongings or steal the bag, without special cutting equipment. Perfect for when you want to leave your stuff and go for a swim at the beach!Love it or loathe it, our tech products are now essential to our daily lives. We designed a removable tech sleeve that can accommodate all your daily tech products, so you can work anywhere! The tech sleeve uses Velcro to attach inside the backpack and is quick and easy to remove. If you're carrying other heavy backpacks or suitcases and don't want to have our backpack on your back, our smart strap system allows you to convert the backpack into a messenger bag. The main straps can be hidden inside the back panel of the bag and replaced with the included shoulder strap. When the straps have been hidden, the backpack can also be attached to a suitcase.Our main issue with regular waterproof bags? You can never find your things! We've included 4 outer pockets to help you store and access everything you need. The ""secret"" backpocket allows you to hide your valuables in the most secure place possible - between your bag and your body. The main front pocket is water resistant and great for storing your phone, wallet and cash when you're hiking. The card pocket on the front means no more searching around for your travel passes and the side bottle pocket is perfect for keeping you hydrated.We also have two inner pockets (a big one for your cellphone/wallet) and a small one for you keys!  
We know we've got an ambitious timeline but due to our experience in production, we're very confident we can produce and deliver all backpacks to our backers in April 2017! Code 10 was founded by Charlie + Chris, two product designers from the UK and Switzerland. We met whilst working in Hong Kong a city where your working life and the outdoors blend together. We both love to travel, surf and spend our time adventuring.Why Waterproof?With regular ""Code 10"" typhoons, Hong Kong can be a very rainy place - like many tropical places, it can go from sunshine to rain in a matter of seconds. Over the last few years we therefore found ourselves using waterproof bags a lot, especially if we knew we would be taking our laptops to a client meeting in the morning, then heading off to a beach or a hiking trail in the afternoon.However, we found that most waterproof bags aren't designed to be functional for everyday use. Usually they don't have practical pockets and have no space for your tech products. Our first step was to design a waterproof bag that would be really useful, and perfectly suit our mixture of work and leisure, city life and travel. Why Lockable?  Although Hong Kong is generally a safe place, it’s still a big city and there’s always the risk of pick-pocketing and petty theft. We therefore designed the pockets on the bag so that we could keep our valuables in an easy-to-reach position, but also completely out of reach of criminals.Both of us had also experienced theft several times while travelling, especially when we were surfing and had left our belongings on the beach. It was really important to us that we could leave our bag almost anywhere and be confident that no opportunistic thieves could get inside our bag, or carry it away.

<p>In terms of wind resistance, aluminium poles, full length pole sleeves and plenty of guy rope attachment points give you best-in-class performance.  In response to early feedback, we've already decided to add even more guy rope attachments to the production model to help in very strong winds.</p>
<p>A common problem with tents when the temperature drops is condensation. We've got that covered too! The inner tent is made from breathable polyester fabric, which combined with excellent airflow under the fly makes the Siesta4 extremely condensation-resistant.</p>

<p>Waking up in the Siesta4 is more like waking up at home with the blinds/curtains closed than waking up in a tent. Unless you set your alarm, chances are you’ll carry on sleeping until you wake up naturally.</p>
<p>Basically, you won’t be woken up by bright light, and you won’t feel a burst of heat when the sun hits your tent. It's comparable to pitching a regular tent in complete shade, such as under a large tree… only it’s darker inside, and you don’t need to find a tree or move your tent when the angle of the sun changes!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>What's the temperature like?</b></p>
<p>This chart compares the air temperature inside the Siesta4 to a tent made from regular tent fabric. This data was recorded on a typical summer morning in Spain. As a general rule in any climate, the temperature inside the Siesta4 remains relatively close to the temperature of the (ambient) air outside the tent. We've also marked on the chart the time at which one fan was turned on. As you can see, the Siesta4 is dramatically cooler than a regular tent even without a fan running. In this example the doors were closed so you can see how the fan helps keeps the temperature down when the tent is nice and dark inside.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447331454/vhdangudqalt8aotm5mc.png"" src=""""/></p>By contrast, the air inside a normal tent gets extremely hot. In reality you’d be much hotter than the air temperature indicates because this doesn't account for the additional heat you feel as a result of infrared radiation. Infrared energy doesn't heat the air - it’s only converted into heat when it’s absorbed by your skin (or your tent).</div><div> </div><div>
<p><b>How dark is it?</b></p>
<p>A small amount of light comes in through the 4"" gap around the bottom of the fly.  This isn't enough to wake you up, but it's enough to be able to find your way around the tent. If you want more light you can simply open the doors of the fly.  It's more of a dim glow that's diffused by the wall of the inner tent.</p>To accurately demonstrate the difference between fabrics, we made an identical tent out of standard tent polyester. These two photos are taken using the exact same camera settings.</div><div>

The inner tent is made from breathable polyester fabric (210T ripstop taffeta), and has two huge double doors with full mesh panels.

<p>Having two doors means both ends of the tent can be opened up for great cross-flow of air, giving the best possible ventilation. Opening up all the doors also turns the tent into a great hang-out space if you need a break from the heat during the day! </p>
<p>In crowded campsites, such as festivals, the tent can be easily pitched without guy ropes. Just stake out the corners and vestibules. Of course, we advise you to add extra stakes and guy ropes if it’s likely to be very windy.</p>
<p>Only four poles and a familiar dome style design means the intuitive setup is quick and easy. The inner tent can be left clipped in, so everything can be pitched in one go.</p>

<li>High quality aluminium poles for strength and durability</li>
<li>Full length pole sleeves for additional structural stability</li>

<p>We spent many months developing our unique, ultra-reflective fly fabric. The base fabric is 210T polyester taffeta cloth, the same as is used to make other high quality tents. The difference is that ours undergoes a special process that applies a reflective coating on one side, and a polyurethane coating on the other. Both coatings are waterproof, and the seams are sealed at the factory with industry standard PU seam tape. This also means you can repair the fly with a standard tent repair kit should any accidental damage occur (always apply the repair patch to the underside of the fly, not the reflective side).</p>
<p>To demonstrate how reflective our fly fabric is, here’s a comparison with some other materials using an infrared thermal camera. This image shows several different fabrics, placed on a hotplate:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447332242/lw3ectxiksdgl52jjn5m.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The dark colour is due to aluminium cooking foil and our fabric both having low emissivity (they don’t radiate much heat), which shows that they are also excellent heat reflectors. In contrast, normal polyester tent fabric absorbs and radiates heat very well, which is why it’s almost the same colour as the hotplate itself.</p>
<p>You can see an even more dramatic effect when the whole tent is viewed by a thermal camera on hot sunny day:</p>

A fabric air duct connects an opening in the inner tent to the vent on the fly, and the outer end of the duct has insect mesh so bugs can’t use you as a tasty treat.</div><div>

Power consumption is very low so battery life isn't a problem . The fans are supplied with a 2-speed USB power adapter. This allows 'eco' mode for extended battery life or 'max' mode of maximum cooling.<br/><br/>We recommend portable rechargeable power banks like the ones used to charge cell phones and tablets, and/or solar charging kits. </div><div>

<p>For most camping trips (less than a week), a portable battery (USB power bank) can run the fan for a few hours each day without needing to be recharged. We evaluated the options for supplying our own portable battery packs, but we can’t currently compete with the prices you can find online from Amazon, eBay etc. Therefore we've created a table to give you an idea of what size battery to buy. </p>
<p>We recommend buying from a reputable brand (check the online reviews) as not all battery packs provide as much real world capacity as the suppliers claim. If in doubt buy a slightly larger capacity pack than you think you'll need. If you want to run two fans, simply double the capacity. Also look for a model that has a 2A or higher output capacity.</p>
<p>If you wish to use the same battery pack to charge your cell phone or other devices while camping, don’t forget to add extra capacity for those devices as well.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>As an example, with one fan a 20,000mah power bank should last most people for a week of camping without needing to be recharged. For more examples, search ‘usb power bank’ on your favourite online shopping site.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What about solar?</b></p>A solar panel with 5v USB or 12v output is a great option for powering the fan(s), especially in hotter climates.  You can leave it connected overnight and the fans will start as soon as the sun hits the panel in the morning. Furthermore, you can leave the fans running during the day so the tent remains at a lower temperature in case you fancy a nap at any time.<br/><br/>For a single fan we recommend 8-16W panels. If you want to run two fans from a single solar panel a 20W or higher panel is recommended.<br/><br/>Solar panels can be a little more expensive than USB power banks so for shorter trips, a USB power bank that can last the duration of the trip may be a more economical option. Please feel free to email us if you’d like advice about which is the best option for your particular type of usage.<p> </p>

<p>Outback Logic LLC is a US company founded by a team of entrepreneurs from Australia, America, and England, who got together to bring Gareth’s idea for a heat-reflective, light-blocking tent to life. We’re a multidisciplinary bunch with a wealth of commercial experience. We partnered with leading fabric, tent, and specialist coating manufacturers to develop a world-class product and make the Siesta4 a reality.</p>
<p>Gareth originally had the idea while camping at a festival in the Australian outback. Having camped in a number of warm climates, including Australia, Southern Europe, California, and Nevada, he realised there was huge potential for a heat-reflective tent, and undertook extensive research, design and development to prove the concept and ensure commercial viability.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Why are we here?</b></span></p>
<p>The manufacture of tents at a competitive price is only possible at volume, especially as we’re also producing our own custom fabric, which is more complicated and more expensive than typical tent fabrics. We use a crowdfunded business model to help cover the upfront manufacturing costs and more accurately determine what quantities of tents and fans to produce.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Since our Kickstarter in November 2015 we’ve completed all tooling and development, and produced four production runs of tents. During this time, we’ve refined our production processes and further strengthened our supply chain. All manufacturing carries some risks, but with the experience we’ve gained over the past two years we can be very confident of another smooth production run and timely delivery.</p>
<p>We've seen how frustrating it can be for backers when project owners are not open and transparent about delays or problems. We promise to post regular updates and in the unlikely event of any problems we'll let everyone know exactly what's going on and how we're going to fix it.</p>

In terms of wind resistance, aluminium poles, full length pole sleeves and plenty of guy rope attachment points give you best-in-class performance.  In response to early feedback, we've already decided to add even more guy rope attachments to the production model to help in very strong winds.
A common problem with tents when the temperature drops is condensation. We've got that covered too! The inner tent is made from breathable polyester fabric, which combined with excellent airflow under the fly makes the Siesta4 extremely condensation-resistant.
 

Waking up in the Siesta4 is more like waking up at home with the blinds/curtains closed than waking up in a tent. Unless you set your alarm, chances are you’ll carry on sleeping until you wake up naturally.
Basically, you won’t be woken up by bright light, and you won’t feel a burst of heat when the sun hits your tent. It's comparable to pitching a regular tent in complete shade, such as under a large tree… only it’s darker inside, and you don’t need to find a tree or move your tent when the angle of the sun changes!

 
What's the temperature like?
This chart compares the air temperature inside the Siesta4 to a tent made from regular tent fabric. This data was recorded on a typical summer morning in Spain. As a general rule in any climate, the temperature inside the Siesta4 remains relatively close to the temperature of the (ambient) air outside the tent. We've also marked on the chart the time at which one fan was turned on. As you can see, the Siesta4 is dramatically cooler than a regular tent even without a fan running. In this example the doors were closed so you can see how the fan helps keeps the temperature down when the tent is nice and dark inside.
By contrast, the air inside a normal tent gets extremely hot. In reality you’d be much hotter than the air temperature indicates because this doesn't account for the additional heat you feel as a result of infrared radiation. Infrared energy doesn't heat the air - it’s only converted into heat when it’s absorbed by your skin (or your tent). 
How dark is it?
A small amount of light comes in through the 4"" gap around the bottom of the fly.  This isn't enough to wake you up, but it's enough to be able to find your way around the tent. If you want more light you can simply open the doors of the fly.  It's more of a dim glow that's diffused by the wall of the inner tent.To accurately demonstrate the difference between fabrics, we made an identical tent out of standard tent polyester. These two photos are taken using the exact same camera settings.



 
The Siesta4 is a double-walled design. The inner tent is made from breathable polyester fabric (210T ripstop taffeta), and has two huge double doors with full mesh panels. There are two circular side vents with zips to attach the fans, and there are also two smaller mesh vents in the roof of the tent.  All the mesh panels can be zipped closed, so the inner tent can be fully protected against wind-borne sand and dust.
Having two doors means both ends of the tent can be opened up for great cross-flow of air, giving the best possible ventilation. Opening up all the doors also turns the tent into a great hang-out space if you need a break from the heat during the day! 
In crowded campsites, such as festivals, the tent can be easily pitched without guy ropes. Just stake out the corners and vestibules. Of course, we advise you to add extra stakes and guy ropes if it’s likely to be very windy.
Only four poles and a familiar dome style design means the intuitive setup is quick and easy. The inner tent can be left clipped in, so everything can be pitched in one go.
Other features include:

High quality aluminium poles for strength and durability
Full length pole sleeves for additional structural stability
2 vestibules give loads of storage space for bags, cooler etc.
Adjustable fly door positions (using toggles on the inside) make it easy to increase ventilation without letting in too much light
High-sided, heavy-duty, waterproof floor
Top quality YKK zippers
Central lantern loop
16 additional hanging loops
6 mesh storage pockets
Power cord access zippers
Reflective guy ropes
16 x Super-strong 8"" aluminum stakes


 


We spent many months developing our unique, ultra-reflective fly fabric. The base fabric is 210T polyester taffeta cloth, the same as is used to make other high quality tents. The difference is that ours undergoes a special process that applies a reflective coating on one side, and a polyurethane coating on the other. Both coatings are waterproof, and the seams are sealed at the factory with industry standard PU seam tape. This also means you can repair the fly with a standard tent repair kit should any accidental damage occur (always apply the repair patch to the underside of the fly, not the reflective side).
To demonstrate how reflective our fly fabric is, here’s a comparison with some other materials using an infrared thermal camera. This image shows several different fabrics, placed on a hotplate:
 

The dark colour is due to aluminium cooking foil and our fabric both having low emissivity (they don’t radiate much heat), which shows that they are also excellent heat reflectors. In contrast, normal polyester tent fabric absorbs and radiates heat very well, which is why it’s almost the same colour as the hotplate itself.
You can see an even more dramatic effect when the whole tent is viewed by a thermal camera on hot sunny day:
 

 
In a camping world first, we have designed a ducted vent system that keeps out heat and light, whilst allowing fresh air in from outside. A fabric air duct connects an opening in the inner tent to the vent on the fly, and the outer end of the duct has insect mesh so bugs can’t use you as a tasty treat.

 Inside the tent the vent opening can be left uncovered for natural ventilation, or one of our custom fans can be zipped in. The duct can be left in place when the tent is rolled up, but the fan(s) have to be removed and packed separately.  
The fan(s) can be run from any 2A USB power source. Power consumption is very low so battery life isn't a problem . The fans are supplied with a 2-speed USB power adapter. This allows 'eco' mode for extended battery life or 'max' mode of maximum cooling.We recommend portable rechargeable power banks like the ones used to charge cell phones and tablets, and/or solar charging kits. 

For most camping trips (less than a week), a portable battery (USB power bank) can run the fan for a few hours each day without needing to be recharged. We evaluated the options for supplying our own portable battery packs, but we can’t currently compete with the prices you can find online from Amazon, eBay etc. Therefore we've created a table to give you an idea of what size battery to buy. 
We recommend buying from a reputable brand (check the online reviews) as not all battery packs provide as much real world capacity as the suppliers claim. If in doubt buy a slightly larger capacity pack than you think you'll need. If you want to run two fans, simply double the capacity. Also look for a model that has a 2A or higher output capacity.
If you wish to use the same battery pack to charge your cell phone or other devices while camping, don’t forget to add extra capacity for those devices as well.
 

As an example, with one fan a 20,000mah power bank should last most people for a week of camping without needing to be recharged. For more examples, search ‘usb power bank’ on your favourite online shopping site.
 
What about solar?A solar panel with 5v USB or 12v output is a great option for powering the fan(s), especially in hotter climates.  You can leave it connected overnight and the fans will start as soon as the sun hits the panel in the morning. Furthermore, you can leave the fans running during the day so the tent remains at a lower temperature in case you fancy a nap at any time.For a single fan we recommend 8-16W panels. If you want to run two fans from a single solar panel a 20W or higher panel is recommended.Solar panels can be a little more expensive than USB power banks so for shorter trips, a USB power bank that can last the duration of the trip may be a more economical option. Please feel free to email us if you’d like advice about which is the best option for your particular type of usage.

Outback Logic LLC is a US company founded by a team of entrepreneurs from Australia, America, and England, who got together to bring Gareth’s idea for a heat-reflective, light-blocking tent to life. We’re a multidisciplinary bunch with a wealth of commercial experience. We partnered with leading fabric, tent, and specialist coating manufacturers to develop a world-class product and make the Siesta4 a reality.
Gareth originally had the idea while camping at a festival in the Australian outback. Having camped in a number of warm climates, including Australia, Southern Europe, California, and Nevada, he realised there was huge potential for a heat-reflective tent, and undertook extensive research, design and development to prove the concept and ensure commercial viability.
 
Why are we here?
The manufacture of tents at a competitive price is only possible at volume, especially as we’re also producing our own custom fabric, which is more complicated and more expensive than typical tent fabrics. We use a crowdfunded business model to help cover the upfront manufacturing costs and more accurately determine what quantities of tents and fans to produce.
 
Risks & Challenges
Since our Kickstarter in November 2015 we’ve completed all tooling and development, and produced four production runs of tents. During this time, we’ve refined our production processes and further strengthened our supply chain. All manufacturing carries some risks, but with the experience we’ve gained over the past two years we can be very confident of another smooth production run and timely delivery.
We've seen how frustrating it can be for backers when project owners are not open and transparent about delays or problems. We promise to post regular updates and in the unlikely event of any problems we'll let everyone know exactly what's going on and how we're going to fix it.",36.0,1,"2 Campaigns

With your contributions, Scamper Van is putting together a variety of perks for you to enjoy. From Scamper Van schwag and cool camping gear, to FREE rentals in our prototype and even a Music Festival Weekend with the founders of Scamper Van. 
YOUR HELP changes the way people in our area explore the Southeast and beyond.


No Scampers No Campers
The idea is solid, the support is there too, but we need YOU to make Scamper Van a reality. With YOUR HELP we can change the way people in the Southeast explore this great country of ours.
Can't Help Financially??  

That's okay - we understand that not everyone has a bucket of money laying around - but if you still love our idea and the passion behind it - SUPPORT US ANYWAY.  
Tell our story to friends, share our posts on social media, hand out our stickers.  Whatever it takes.  Support from you can look like many different things.  We just thank you for being interested in our dream.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

When a liquid hits an untreated surface, it pools on the surface, like a deflated ball, causing the item to become saturated.  When water, mud and ice contact a YDROP treated surface, the extreme contact angle causes the liquid to form nearly perfect spheres, like marbles of water. The spheres then glide off the surface, keeping the item clean and dry. 





The substance is colourless and odourless. It looks just like water, but apply it to any material and once dry, you can spill pretty much anything on it and just wipe it off with a cloth. You can see how it works with wine in the video below. 




Work on the substance is ongoing, and coatings have already been developed for:

Textiles, leather and suede (industrial and commercial)
Stones, concrete, bricks and plaster
Wood, paper and cardboard
Metal surfaces





There is some competition from waterproofing products for sportswear and creams and sprays for shoes, however these are paraffin based products which are very different from nanotechnology.


What distinguishes YDROP from competitors?


A completely transparent coating, invisible to the eye (unlike other substances).
It’s undetectable by touch and doesn't leave a crust.

It doesn't affect the permeability of surfaces, won't block pores and leaves surfaces breathable.
Maintains a high resistance to dirt.
The ability to ‘clean itself’. Drops of water simply roll off the surface of the material, collecting up any bits of dust or dirt.
Antibacterial properties. YDROP prevents the growth of harmful pathogens.
Protection against UV radiation, which prevents discolouration.
It is odourless, making it suitable for household cleaning.
The canister is not pressurised, making it safe to use.
It is biologically inert (non-reactive), biocompatible (interacts appropriately with a surface) and non-toxic.",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Letter from the family</h3>
<h3>---------------------------------</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Josh.  My family and I were just uprooted from a fire that destroyed everything of ours.  We lost all of our childrens' clothes, all our furniture, and all of our memories stored in pictures and videos.  All I am asking for is any kind of donations that can help us get back on our feet, and possibly into a new place, so our children aren't uprooted, and having to stay in a hotel for too long.  We aren't expecting to reach the goal number, we'd be happy with whatever can be contributed.  I appreciate what can be donated, so please let me thank you now.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the Bottom of my Heart,</p>
<p>Josh Nymon</p>

<h3>A CALL TO HELP</h3>
<h3>------------------------</h3>
<p>My good friend Josh Nymon and his family endured a horrific tragedy on September 2, 2012. A fire totally consumed their house in Carlsbad, CA and everything inside it. Luckily everyone made it out unharmed, but they are in need of help.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, they were in the process of consolidating insurance to another provider, were uninsured for a couple weeks while waiting for their new coverage to start, and have no financial support. With this in mind, we are trying to band together to do what we can. Please donate whatever possible, whether it be clothes, household goods, or money, anything will help as they now have nothing. Please, if you can help in any way to get him, his wife Stephanie, his 2 twin five year old boys, and his three year old daughter, the basics in life to begin to rebuild their future.</p>
<p>Also, any guidance or information regarding any supportive programs out there would also be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your charity.</p>

<p>As a <b>business person</b> you want more influence and attract more customers, as a <b>scientist</b> you want to gain more attention for your work and more influence on it's results, as an <b>artist</b> you want more people to recognize your art and more influence in how it is communicated, as a <b>philanthropist</b> you want more awareness for what you support and more influence in the importance of it, as an <b>athlete</b> you want to generate more awareness for your sport and more influence in its rules, and <b>anybody</b> who has a passion for something want to gain more influence and attract more like minded people. <br/>appearoo helps attract more people to what matters to you the most.<br/><i>...democratization of influence.</i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<h3>Vision</h3>
<p>We see a world where significantly more people gain influence and provide a much larger variety of insights and knowledge than ever before. We want to help scientists gain more attention for the research and inventions they make. Young musicians, artists and actors to raise their profile and gain attention outside the mainstream channels, we want to help young politicians to communicate new ways for better politics before they vanish away in an ever more complicated political network. We want young entrepreneurs to introduce their new technology to a large audience and we want philanthropists be able to raise more awareness for the work they are doing. It's great to see all those people already sharing a lot of great content - we see appearoo the part that raises the level of appearance for all the content across all networks.  </p>

How It Works









Main benefits



SCENARIO:Lets assume you are introducing a new idea, product, or an event: To get the word out, you are posting on your blog, share the news on Twitter, you upload images to Pinterest, share a video on YouTube, respond to relevant questions on Quora, post updates on Facebook and LinkedIn groups, run events as Meetups and share the presentations on SlideShare - and more.
WITHOUT APPEAROOWithout appearoo you would either need to feature and promote all the sites simultaneously which is an enormous effort or settle with accidental visitors, who just happen to pass by. This problem causes many people to even reduce the number of networks they are engaged with - and as a consequence they also reduce their appearance and influence.

WITH APPEAROOWith appearoo you have all your profiles on one page. You share the page with a single link (appearoo.com/yourname) - wherever you are, whatever you do. By having your 'appearoo link' on your email signature, on your profiles, on your business card, your presentation and use it on every post or comment as a signature, you maximize your appearance - and with it your influence.

It includes also a unique messaging system to protect your email and let others still contact you. Premium also includes access to support team.

How we use the funds:

Re-design the UX / UI for the current product. So far we focused on the value and functionality first. Now it's time to cross the chasm. This is a 3 month project and so we should have it completed by Mid February 2015.

We also want to build a more sophisticated 'influence engine' which will allow you to build 'circles of influence' around the topics that matter to you the most. When a whole group of people starts talking about a specific topic, you will be able to attract even more attention.
If we get more than $15,000 we will invest in a new analytics and reporting engine.  It will generate more sophisticated reports with drill down capabilities.
And if there is even more funding we will develop a mobile app for appearoo.
And then there is the improvement of our API in the list so that other developer can leverage our platform. 
In case we don't reach the entire goal we invest whatever we get to update the UI to the best of our abilities.

 With a mix of many different cycling disciplines and skill levels being accommodated, the park will help riders of all ages and abilities grow. Creating bike parks can helps bring the community together, provide positive environments for growing and promote

Mon deuxième obstacle majeur vient du vélo. J’ai appris tout ce que je pouvais afin de réparer mon vélo en route. Mon vélo n’a plus de secrets pour moi, et sur ce voyage nous serons les meilleurs amis !
La dernière difficulté vient de ma capacité physique. Malgré les conseils de cyclistes professionnels préconisant que l’on s'entraîne en chemin ; j’ai souhaité me préparer un peu avant le départ. Je m’entraîne donc tous les jours et ai réalisé plusieurs voyages d’un ou deux jours afin de m’assurer que mon vélo et moi étions à la hauteur. Nous nous sentons prêts à relever le défi !
D’autres façons d’aider
Je ne m’attends pas à ce que tout le monde veuille des cartes, photographies ou une visite … Cependant, je vous serais très reconnaissante si vous pouviez partager cette page avec vos proches - peut-être apprécieraient-ils des cartes du Royaume Uni ?
Ou peut-être pourriez-vous m’aider à trouver un lit et une bonne douche pour une nuit…
Partagez le lien, et partagez avec moi vos idées !
Je posterai sur un blog durant le voyage (www.ckernsblog.wordpress.com), non seulement pour partager le voyage mais aussi mes pensées sur la photographie et la vie en générale durant ces longues journées seule sur la route.Merci d’avoir lu, je vous envoie toutes les bonnes énergies que je peux dès à présent !",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are happy to present a new collaboration between two family owned American companies- Grim Workshop and Bear Minimum in their creation of a joint product line we would like to introduce as ""Grim and Bear it"".</p>
<p>We developed a new product line that compliments the Bear Bowl cook pot perfectly and also can be used as a stand-alone cooking system or even with other cooking pots. Both Grim Workshop and Bear Minimum have high standards when it comes to manufacturing and materials and are excited about these new products.  All the tools are made from hardened surgical stainless steel and are very sturdy especially when you see how small they are.  The flagship tools are...</p>
<p>1. Liddle: A lid that doubles as a cooking griddle. It comes with a detachable handle,  We call it the “Liddle"".</p>

<p>2. Bare Bones Stove: A stove/pot stand you can use with twigs on an alcohol burner and other heat sources.  The “Bear Bones Stove” can function as a grill, a stove, and comes with a half dozen skewers for cooking vegetables and meats while you use the top side for other cooking necessities and disassembles to fit back on its' storage card that is the same size as a Baby Bear base plate.</p>

<p>3. Eat'n Card: A card with ten functions, including two spatulas, a large fork, a small spatula with a bottle, and can opener, a peeler, a cutting edge, and can be combined into forming two separate tongs for cooking.  That means no waste from plastic utensils and cutlery. </p>

They provided us not only with the equipment required for this adventure but also with professional tips to make it happen.                      Thank you to all of you backers supporting this project!!A special thanks to Industrio Ventures, the Italian hardware startup accelerator that gave us the propeller and boost to make this project possible.A huge thanks to Andrea Pugiotto and Ruggero Arena that made all these amazing photos and videos to document all the work done and present it in the best way possible!Risks and challengesThe design and features are 100% definite, we have well established relations with supply chain Italian manufacturers and partners, all based in the North East of Italy close to us, so we definitely have control over who is going to produce and what. The major part of the development has already been completed, we will begin the pre-series manufacturing and testing thanks to the Indiegogo Indemand campaign.We are supported by the Italian hardware startup accelerator Industrio Ventures, meaning that we get a steady support of specialists on new product and business development, industrialization and business administration.We have the technical expertise to control the project management side as well as part of the assembling process. So there are no major or peculiar risks with reference to the design and engineering side. We might face short delays in the delivery of components however we will be doing our best to ensure a timely delivery of your Sentier Bike Trolley.",49.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>The 16 oz.

<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why don't the occupants roll together like other so-called ""double hammocks""?</strong></h3>
<p>Like our other patented 2-person hammocks, each occupant is supported by their own suspension in their own bed area.  The angle of the V-shaped insert in the middle keeps you from knocking shoulders with the other occupant.  The beds are held apart with the ""Flex-Rod"" on the wide end of the hammock.   If you are going solo, and you just have a pack, you don't need to flex the hammock at all to be flat and comfortable between two trees, so you can leave the flex rod at home.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How do you hang the hammock?</h3>
<p>The hammock comes with a fantastic, simple hanging system that includes tree protection staps and adjustable slings that hold over 2000 lbs.  It's quick and easy to attach the straps to two trees and hook the slings on the hitches that are pre-installed on the hammock. Then you can easily adjust the slings to your desired slack.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Is the hammock waterproof?</h3>
<p>The hammock is water repellent and breathable, but not waterproof.  We highly recommend the sil-nylon Vertex tarp that comes with our featured perk.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Do I need three trees or just two?</h3>
<p>You only need two trees that are 12-18 feet apart (3.5-5.5 m).  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What size people fit in the Flex-360?</h3>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong></p>
<p>The main solo bed holds at least 700 lbs, but the size of the bed limits the capacity to 275 lbs (125 kg).  The secondary bed is big enough to fit an extra person or gear that is up to 175 lbs (80 kg).  For best comfort, the total weight of two occupants should not exceed 375 lbs (170 kg). </p>
<p><b>Height:</b></p>
<p>Because of the diagonal angle, the main solo bed holds a person up to 6' 6"" (1.98 m) tall.  The secondary bed  holds a person who is up to 6 feet tall (1.82 m). </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How do I set up on the ground?</h3>
<p>The Flex-360 sets up nicely on the ground as a bivy that fits two people.  However, we recommend you purchase the optional ground kit (which comes with the Ultimate Bundle perk) if you plan to use it this way.  The ground kit includes a sealed footprint to protect the breathable bottom of the hammock.  The kit also includes three stakes. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How do I insulate the Flex-360?</h3>
<p>You can easily prepare the Flex-360 for even the harshest winter weather.  The optional insulation kit (which comes with our Ultimate Bundle perk) will keep you warm down to single digits Fahrenheit (at least -12 Celsius) if you use a sleeping bag meant for those temperatures.  The hammock has velcro sewn-in to receive our underquilt kit. </p>
<p>Prefer an air pad? You can easily place an air pad directly under your sleeping bag inside the tent.  Pads like the Big Agnes Q-Core pad tend to stay put because of the materials they use.  Sleeping bags made by companies like Big Agnes have a sleeve in the bottom for your pad to keep it perfectly secure.</p>

You'd be hard-pressed to find a duo that has put as much blood, sweat and tears into this sport, and this April, STONY has a real chance to finally use all they've learned to achieve their ultimate goal in quidditch - winning the World Cup. And with this year's Lost Boys team, heavily considered to be one of the favorites in the tournament, their odds are better than ever.

More distribution centres are planned in Australia, New Zealand and of course we are gearing up to have these in a number of retail sites as we extend our wholesale program through increased production at lower costs.</p><p>In order to expand quickly enough though SAS has decided to run an Indiegogo campaign to raise the necessary production volumes to get the lower pricing we need for all of this. That's why we are going to give you a never to be repeated deal on our bows.</p><p>But don't take our word for it. Check out what the following expert gear reviewers said about our bows.

You just get a great bow at a really great price for helping us out! Now that's a pretty sweet deal for both of us!</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>SAS believe that this novel invention will change the archery industry somewhat in that customers will be able to transport their bows more easily and therefore be able to better enjoy their sport and we think that because of the portability we will see, as we have already, a whole lot more people taking up the sport.</p><p>The product will also allow for an increased ability of survivalists and hikers to acquire nourishment in the necessary situations.</p><p>This product is already selling well in the US, Canada, Europe, South Africa, etc and is being raved about by many gear reviewers on Youtube and there are more reviewers asking us all the time for product to do reviews.</p><p>For more information on the bow please visit <a href=""http://www.survivalarcherysystems.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.survivalarcherysystems.com</a></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Luckily for you there are no risks for you. Although we have set a campaign target, you will get your bow irrespective of the funds raised as we are currently running with production and probably have the stock already. In fact, the less bows we sell on this campaign the sooner you will receive your bow as the sooner we can produce it if not produced already in our backup stock.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p><p>If you like our product and wish to assist us please could you share this campaign far and wide.</p><p>We would really appreciate your help!

The company is a spin-off from an engineering design and development company that has serviced the automotive and petrochemical industries and hold various sports patents across the globe.SAS launched in the USA in October of 2015 and currently has outlets in the USA, Canada, South Africa and Europe. More distribution centres are planned in Australia, New Zealand and of course we are gearing up to have these in a number of retail sites as we extend our wholesale program through increased production at lower costs.In order to expand quickly enough though SAS has decided to run an Indiegogo campaign to raise the necessary production volumes to get the lower pricing we need for all of this. That's why we are going to give you a never to be repeated deal on our bows.But don't take our word for it. Check out what the following expert gear reviewers said about our bows. There are plenty more of these on the video tab on our website at www.survivalarcherysystems.com as well.TwangnbangCanadian PrepperWhat We Need & What You GetSAS want to increase current production levels in order to reduce production costs and expand our wholesale program.In order to do this we would like to get up front orders which will allow us not only to fund this additional volume, but will also allow us to get some additional funds to grow.As the business is already running, all of the campaign funds will go directly toward additional stock and there is therefore zero risk to you. You just get a great bow at a really great price for helping us out! Now that's a pretty sweet deal for both of us!The ImpactSAS believe that this novel invention will change the archery industry somewhat in that customers will be able to transport their bows more easily and therefore be able to better enjoy their sport and we think that because of the portability we will see, as we have already, a whole lot more people taking up the sport.The product will also allow for an increased ability of survivalists and hikers to acquire nourishment in the necessary situations.This product is already selling well in the US, Canada, Europe, South Africa, etc and is being raved about by many gear reviewers on Youtube and there are more reviewers asking us all the time for product to do reviews.For more information on the bow please visit www.survivalarcherysystems.comRisks & ChallengesLuckily for you there are no risks for you. Although we have set a campaign target, you will get your bow irrespective of the funds raised as we are currently running with production and probably have the stock already. In fact, the less bows we sell on this campaign the sooner you will receive your bow as the sooner we can produce it if not produced already in our backup stock.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:If you like our product and wish to assist us please could you share this campaign far and wide.We would really appreciate your help!

<h3>WHO AM I?</h3>
<p>My name's Sara &amp; I'm a senior Photography major at the New Hampshire Institute of Art in Manchester, NH. For my Spring Break this semester, I plan on traveling to Scotland. As good as a vacation this may sound, I'm not there to vacation, I'm there to work! I plan on getting ahold of some family-owned businesses before I leave to see if they would let me photograph them. I plan on photographing them within their everyday surroundings.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?</strong></h3>
<p>All the money raised is going straight to my traveling fees. This will help me travel around Scotland and meet with the families and/or any other people I meet along the way. Any extra money raised is going towards the finalization of my Senior Project. The show for that is May 19, 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>YOUR IMPACT AS A SUPPORTER:</h3>
<p>It's finally the last semester of my senior year of college. I've been extremely motivated throughout the years and with your support, I can end my college photography career with a *BANG*! I plan on giving a few of the end-result books away to those who helped shape me. If you can contribute anything, I will be eternally grateful.</p>
</div>

<h3>CAN'T DONATE? HELP SPREAD THE WORD!</h3>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Ryan Fuller. I volunteer at Coast Hills Community Church as a high school Discipleship Group Leader, as well as a volunteer College Ministry Leader. Since I rededicated my life to Jesus Christ about a year and a half ago, I've done what I could to step up and show the redeeming love that God first showed me, to those around me. I'm blessed and grateful to be where I am, but I know that what gifts He gives us are to be used for His Kingdom. </p>
<p>This trip is a Christmas party for some of the most impoverished people of Ecuador, and our goal is to serve and bring the Joy of the Lord to their hometown and to their lives. Since I was in high school, I felt that I had some small tugging on my heart for the people of South and Central America. I know that God will use this to not only affect those I interact with, but also to expand my understanding of who He is as well.</p>
<p>Through your donation, I will be able to fund my trip, which costs $2100 (~$800 flight cost, $1200 mission cost, $100 fundraising cost) with the majority going towards the purchase or gifts, food for the people we serve, in the 7 different locations we will be visiting, ministering to more than 10,000 people in the duration of the week. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Plain and simple: I need help. The Lord has provided in more ways than I can count, and I know this is just one more way for Him to show His glory. I trust that the money will be provided, but here is an opportunity for you to be a part of that, and help to spread the word and answer His calling for our lives. </p>
<p>I took spanish in high school, and was nearly fluent by the time I graduated, but that was nearly 6 years ago! I love a challenge, and I have a heart for the Spanish-speaking world, so I feel as though I've learned what I have, and been through experiences that line up with this calling on my life. I don't know where the Lord will lead me, but I know that His plan is better than anything I could come up with on my own. </p>
<p>If the financial goal of $2100 is not met, I will be taking the money out of my personal funds. I believe strongly in the impact of this trip, and I will be faithful either way. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your generous contribution will go towards making an invaluable difference in the lives of those God touches by this trip. The people of the Zàmbiza Dump, and other locations like it surrounding Quito, are in need of encouragement, food, laughter, and the love of Jesus. </p>

<p>Hi! Im Laurel Hinshelwood a 16 year old junior in high school with a passion for helping people. Ever since I can remember the most genuine smile on my face always came from when I felt that I was making an impact on someone's life. I gained this love for helping from my trip to North of Africa in 2010 where I witnessed first hand the suffering some people endure and how different their life can be from my own. Ever since that trip I promised that one day I would help make an impact on peoples lives who were less fortunate than I am. When this wonderful opportunity to travel to Nicaragua with my peers to help the people living in poverty there came up, I just had to apply! </p>
<p>I need your funding because although I have big dreams, I have a small 
wallet. Being a full time student athlete leaves very little time to 
have a job and my school requires that I myself pay for three fourth's 
of the trip. I am a very passionate person and I am determined to reach 
my goal to be able to take part in this experience. <br/></p>
<p>I was one of the few people from my school to be chosen to go on this trip and your contributions would help make my dream a reality. By contributing you will be helping me pay for air fair and the basic living expenses for my time there. <br/></p>
<p>Thank you for your time and I hope we can work together to improve the lives of others!</p>

 DID YOU KNOW?
Bamboo reduces global warming. A grove of bamboo absorbs 3-4 times more carbon dioxide than an equivalent stand of trees and releases 35% more oxygen. 
One acre of bamboo produces oxygen for 24 people to breathe for a year.
Bamboo requires 1/3 the amount of water to grow than is necessary for cotton and yields 10 times more fiber. 
 
  THREE FACTS ABOUT MICROFIBER TOWELS
Microfiber is mainly made of polyester
Polyester takes up to 200 years to decompose and comes from petroleum and coal, two non-renewable resources that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions
When washed, microfiber releases microplastics that end up in the ocean and kill Plankton. Plankton is the main food source of the marine ecosystem and its population has dropped by 40% since 1950

<h3>What is Adventure Pass?</h3>
<p>Adventure Pass is a card for travellers.  With this pass, you’ll be able to walk into hundreds of sports rental shops in countries across the world and get free gear to go skiing, snowboarding, surfing, paddle boarding or mountain biking.  If your gap year is coming up, you’re looking to take a sabbatical or you just love making the most out of your travels, Adventure Pass is the card for you.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-evernote-hover-show=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477923173/egihzxxcl6onj5hwrjps.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are launching Adventure Pass in September 2017.  Right now, you have the opportunity to secure one of the very first Adventure Passes and get in on our incredible Indiegogo-only pricing. Plus, you’ll be helping us build an incredible network of adventures for people all across the globe.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478321099/hzl8ldl2rwfsm0jbmkpf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>Why get an Adventure Pass?</h3>
<p>Ski in the Alps, Surf in Ecuador, Mountain Bike in New Zealand - with the Adventure Pass, no matter where you go, you’ll be able to do what you want to do.  Here's a few friends to explain:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478380830/gzyfkdwgkosmivdxltfr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Never Pay Baggage Fees</strong> - Sure, you can buy your own gear.  But oversize baggage fees can run up to £65 per flight.  And many airlines won’t even take them, so you get to pay to ship them on a separate flight.  On top of all that, you get the fun of lugging all of your gear around on your trip.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Or… you can get an Adventure Pass.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://imgur.com/AHNxUHB"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/AHNxUHB.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""source: imgur.com""/></a></p>
<p><strong>No Plans Required</strong> - Maybe you don’t like planning out your entire itinerary before your trip begins. No problem.  Just pull up our app and you’ll find all of the Adventure Pass partner shops in your area.</p>
<p> <strong>Never Pass up an Adventure</strong> - When you’re traveling the world, every penny matters.  The worst feeling in the world is to fly halfway around the world, get five feet from one of the greatest adventures of your life and have to pass it up because you’re out of cash.  Trust us, all of us everyone at Adventure Pass has been there.  With this card, you can make the most out of your valuable time away - and you don’t have to worry about your budget.</p>

<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>We have set ourselves a tight time scale to get the network live by the September 2017. Thankfully, our founder, Nic, has been working in the action sports gear industry for a long time now, so he already has a lot of inroads with these organisations.  The main trick will be getting enough people to sign up now so that we can show rental shops how much interest there is an how good this will be for their businesses.  That’s why your support now is so important.</p>
<p>At first, our main efforts will be centred on surfing, skiing, mountain biking, paddle boarding and snowboarding.   But with your help we will expand quickly to include KiteSurfing, Paragliding, Kayaking and one off adventures like zip-lining, bungee jumping and whitewater rafting amongst others.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>Where will I be able to hire?</h3>
<p><i>As you saw in the map above, we have already identified a number of our favourite places around the world where we will have Adventure Pass partners.  But it won’t end there. the great thing about backing this campaign is we ask you ""where do you want to hire?' We'll be surveying our backers as soon as the campaign finishes to find out where they want to go and what they want to do there but if we were to have a focus it would be the traditional backpacking regions of South America, Southeast Asia and Australasia.</i></p>
<h3>What will I be able to hire?</h3>
<p><i>You'll be able to hire all the essential equipment needed for that activity for example if you're going skiing you'll need skis, bindings, boots and helmet, surfing - a board, leash and wetsuit (if it's cold), Mountain Biking - Bike &amp; Helmet. If you have any specific questions about gear please email: <a href=""mailto:hello@adventure-pass.com?subject=Question%20about%20Equipment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@adventure-pass.com</a></i></p>
<h3>How does this compare to owning and bringing my own gear?</h3>
<p><i>This is a great question, usually asked by those who love a particular sport. We want to make access to gear cheaper than owning it, so we worked out that if you were to fly with either a bike, surfboard or skis twice in a year you're likely to pay well over £200 in baggage fees and still have the hassle of moving that gear from the airport to your destination. By backing this campaign you'll save yourself this hassle and have unlimited rental for a whole year for only £250. You’ll get to focus on having adventures, not hauling them.</i></p>
<h3>How does it compare to renting as and when I need to?</h3>
<p><i>If you're travelling for an extending period of time, you will be inundated with amazing opportunities for adventures and experiences you simply don't want to miss out on. Recent statistics show you'll spend 35% of your whole trip's budget on these activities. Therefore, over a trip of six months, on a budget of £500 per month, you are likely spend over £1000. Our Premier Pass which covers all activities costs only £600 and if you back us early you'll have it for £450. So that's a 65% saving.  Plus, you’ll have the flexibility of being able to rent whenever and wherever you want.</i></p>
<h3>Can you guarantee the quality of the equipment?</h3>
<p><i>We are only partnering with shops that currently have a strong reputation for quality.  But with our app, you'll be able to rate each shop based on your experience of their service and the quality of their gear. This information will be crucial to us being able to offer a guaranteed level in the future.</i></p>
<h3>What if there's not a partner shop where I am going?</h3>
<p><i>Though we hope you'll always use our app to find a partner shop wherever you are as we grow the network there may be odd occasions where we haven't found a partner. However, as long as we have a week’s notice, we are confident we can bring a partner on board. In the unlikely event that we can't, we will cover the rental cost at whatever hire shop you've found yourself.</i></p>
<h3>How often can I hire gear?</h3>
<p><i>You’ll be able to rent gear for up to a week at a time at each location. You can hire as many times as you like within a 365-day period from buying your pass. As the network is not yet live, if you back the campaign, day one of your 365 days of free rental will begin when you tell us, so no wasted time.</i></p>
<h3>Do you cover insurance?</h3>
<p><i>We do not cover insurance, but it is one of the facilities we would like to offer to complement buying the pass in the future. Until then, it is up to pass holders to ensure that have adequate insurance to cover the activity they are participating in. </i></p>
<h3>Do you cover lift fees or other costs to entry?</h3>
<p><i>Our focus is purely on the equipment you need for the activity you are participating in. We do not cover resort specific entrance fees or lift passes but it is one of the areas we look to expand our offer to in the future.</i></p>
<h3>I want to give a pass as a Christmas present, can you help?</h3>
<p><i>The estimated card delivery date is September 2017. However, we know what an amazing Christmas present any of our passes and packages could be. Therefore providing we hit our target and you let us know no later than 7 December, we will try our best to have something to you in time for Christmas.</i></p>

</div></div>","What is Adventure Pass?
Adventure Pass is a card for travellers.  With this pass, you’ll be able to walk into hundreds of sports rental shops in countries across the world and get free gear to go skiing, snowboarding, surfing, paddle boarding or mountain biking.  If your gap year is coming up, you’re looking to take a sabbatical or you just love making the most out of your travels, Adventure Pass is the card for you.

We are launching Adventure Pass in September 2017.  Right now, you have the opportunity to secure one of the very first Adventure Passes and get in on our incredible Indiegogo-only pricing. Plus, you’ll be helping us build an incredible network of adventures for people all across the globe.

Why get an Adventure Pass?
Ski in the Alps, Surf in Ecuador, Mountain Bike in New Zealand - with the Adventure Pass, no matter where you go, you’ll be able to do what you want to do.  Here's a few friends to explain:

Never Pay Baggage Fees - Sure, you can buy your own gear.  But oversize baggage fees can run up to £65 per flight.  And many airlines won’t even take them, so you get to pay to ship them on a separate flight.  On top of all that, you get the fun of lugging all of your gear around on your trip.
Or… you can get an Adventure Pass.

No Plans Required - Maybe you don’t like planning out your entire itinerary before your trip begins. No problem.  Just pull up our app and you’ll find all of the Adventure Pass partner shops in your area.
 Never Pass up an Adventure - When you’re traveling the world, every penny matters.  The worst feeling in the world is to fly halfway around the world, get five feet from one of the greatest adventures of your life and have to pass it up because you’re out of cash.  Trust us, all of us everyone at Adventure Pass has been there.  With this card, you can make the most out of your valuable time away - and you don’t have to worry about your budget.

We’ve researched and tested a number of forms and textiles in order to create the perfect mattress that you will love to rest on!  You can call it innovation but we call it a revolution! A Monoflow technology allows to blow Futo Mattress up with few simple movements. All you need to do is simply open the Futo Mattress and catch the air around you, (it inflows to four tubes evenly).  Futo Mattress is made from two state-of-the-art materials. The outer layer is made of high-quality Ripstop material using a special reinforcing technique that makes it resistant to tearing and ripping. Similar textile can be found in hot air balloons and high-quality camping hammocks.The inner layer is made of thick polyethylene that holds the air inside and provides extra protection.It is ecologically friendly. It’s water and heat resistant, provides comfort against a rocky or uneven ground, and maintains its strength and durability in even the lowest temperatures! Many researchers have proven that a short nap during the day provides significant benefits, including improved alertness and performance. All you need is... well, a comfortable place to lie down. You know what we mean?   Futo Pillow is the most universal air pillow! It’s ultra portable (size of the sunglasses case), inflates with one simple movement, comfortable and looking great! And yes, it works perfectly with Futo Mattress!

<p>No need for an outlet, an external battery pack keeps Rakin wireless and portable. There is no risk of electric shock, fire or harmful electromagnetic wave exposure. Capable of being powered by any 5V external battery (power bank), Rakin offers unparalleled heating efficiency. To ensure that consumers can use heat bedding more conveniently, compatibility should be assured with various products that are commercially marketed and very easily available. In this smart phone era, compatibility is important for products standardized with DC 5V (2.1A output), which are available anywhere. Rakin is a convenient and safe product compatible with any components such as a DC 5V(2.1A output) battery, auxiliary battery, power bank, power bank auxiliary battery, battery pack, energy storage devices(ESS), and portable DC power supplies, etc., which differs from device that work by plugging a power cord into an AC 110-220V in combination with bedding such as ordinary electric blanket/pad, etc. </p>

<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>What is SFIM?</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><br/>SFIM(SUHO Far-Infrared heating wire composite material), the core technology of Radiance, is a heat-generating new material and releases a special far-infrared ray. Far-infared ray is a new type of infrared radiation that NASA discovered. The typical effect of far-infrared ray generating a heat reaction after being absorbed into our bodies, is enlarging our capillaries, encouraging blood circulation and cellular tissue growth. Also, when the heat reaches the moisture and protein molecules that make up the cells, it shakes the cells 2,000 times per minute. This vitalizes the cellular tissues, helping to prevent aging, boost metabolism, increasing tissue regeneration, and preventing adult diseases such as chronic fatigue. Other benefits include pain reduction, removal of heavy metal particles, deodorization, mold-repelling, dehumidification, and air cleaning, making it useful as medical equipment, kitchen equipment, housing and building materials, textiles, bedding, etc. SFIM is the world's first far-infrared ray containing energy of universe.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><br/>Conventional heating/steaming and thermal equipment has weak or temporary far-infrared effects (weak penetration, short distance, etc.). The heat cannot reach over 1cm under the skin so that it has less therapeutic effect. Most heating/steaming and thermal equipment needs to be applied for at least 30 minutes to warm the muscle tissue by raising its temperature by 1 degree. Such a long exposure to heat may cause burns. The far-infrared heat of Rakin permeates deeply into muscle and bone tissues, perfectly achieving the far-infrared effect of the sun discovered by NASA. Rakin is the only product that can bring real therapeutic effects such as relaxation of muscle pain, improvements of blood circulation, and enhancement of the immune system.</p>

</div></div>","No need for an outlet, an external battery pack keeps Rakin wireless and portable. There is no risk of electric shock, fire or harmful electromagnetic wave exposure. Capable of being powered by any 5V external battery (power bank), Rakin offers unparalleled heating efficiency. To ensure that consumers can use heat bedding more conveniently, compatibility should be assured with various products that are commercially marketed and very easily available. In this smart phone era, compatibility is important for products standardized with DC 5V (2.1A output), which are available anywhere. Rakin is a convenient and safe product compatible with any components such as a DC 5V(2.1A output) battery, auxiliary battery, power bank, power bank auxiliary battery, battery pack, energy storage devices(ESS), and portable DC power supplies, etc., which differs from device that work by plugging a power cord into an AC 110-220V in combination with bedding such as ordinary electric blanket/pad, etc. 
 
 


 
 
 

 

By using heat circulation technology, the thermal energy moves around in sequence, Top – Mid – Bottom of the blanket automatically by the smart algorithm. (Top-Bottom for medium size)

<p>Hi, everyone! It’s Daniel, a.k.a. The Dancing Grad, here, asking for your help to take my competitive ballroom music directing career to the next level. </p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: I’m trying to purchase a used minivan to make the process of bringing my equipment to and from competitions much easier. If you contribute to my campaign, you'll get personalized playlists and commentaries OR *discounted* rates for my music director fees for an upcoming competition. See the video above or the perks structure to the right for details!</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s happened since I’ve started? //</strong> I started operating in the fall of 2014 after a successful Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for sound equipment raised 125% of the original goal within a few months. Since then, I have become the music director for dozens of competitions spanning the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. Collegiate competition credits include Harvard Beginners, UConn, DCDI, Tufts, BADC, Holy Cross, Worcester, BU, Harvard Invitational, and MIT. USA Dance and WDSF competition credits include the American Dancesport Festival, the New England Fall Challenge, Liberty Ball, and many of the country’s largest National Qualifying Events, including the Manhattan Amateur Classic (MAC), the New England Dancesport Championships, the Mid-Atlantic Championships, and the Gumbo Dancesport Championships. </p>
<p><strong>Why do I need my own car? //</strong> After being in operation for three years and taking stock of the business’ finances, I’ve come to realize that one consistent expense that sometimes catches both the competition organizers and myself by surprise is that of a rental car to shuttle my equipment back and forth. To bring my four speakers, subwoofer, soundboards, cables, and trolley, I will use either a rental car agency at the nearest airport or Zipcar to secure at least a mid-size SUV. Those costs add up, between the daily rates, the loss damage waivers, and the gas, sometimes resulting in an expense to the competition or to myself that is greater than the fee that I collect from the competition.</p>
<p>So, I have decided to purchase a used minivan to eliminate the largest costs associated with a rental car or Zipcar (namely the daily rates and the loss damage waivers). While a minivan has more space than my equipment currently needs, it will be very useful in case I expand my sound equipment collection in the future (e.g., a second subwoofer, a fifth or sixth speaker). Having my own car will also ease the budgetary concerns of competitions who reimburse me for a rental car, as the remaining costs (gas, mileage) often make up only about 10% of what a full car rental costs.</p>
<p><strong>How can you help? //</strong> I’m looking to raise funds to purchase the car and get it registered and insured. While I have some funds set aside for it, your monetary help can ensure that I can purchase a better quality used car and maintain it for hopefully many competition seasons. My perks structure is meant to incentivize both individuals invested in getting quality music at a competition and competition organizers and teams, either in the form of playlists or a credit for my fee for your competition this academic year. Take a look at what you can get at various levels of donation.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you! //</strong> It’s been a wild ride from summer 2014 up until this point, and I’m grateful to every dancer and every competition organizer that’s taken a chance on me and let me share my love of music with dancers across the country. I’m looking forward to many more competitive seasons amongst these great groups of dancers, and I’m hoping you can help me ease the monetary strain of it by helping me purchase a used minivan.</p>

Every year, millions of burritos get cold before they're eaten.
Burrito Vest insulates your precious cargo for the journey from burrito purveyor to consumption location. Together, we can prevent cold burritos. 
It's literally your favorite puffy vest in perfect burrito size. 
Made of recycled materials to keep your burrito hot and the planet cool. 


I LOVE BURRITOS
As a grad student, I eat a lot of burritos. I’ll patronize any and all purveyors of tortilla wrapped goodness. Including but not limited to:

Food trucks
Big chains
Local spots
That sketchy gas station on an otherwise deserted rural highway

 

This endless quest for the perfect burrito often leads me far from my ultimate consumption location (home or school) which poses a pretty big problem - time.
Time rapidly slips away from all of us, but even more so if you’re a burrito. Every minute a burrito spends unconsumed, precious degrees of warmth are lost. Science tells us that peak burrito temperature occurs at time of construction, and it’s all downhill from there.
Fed up with cold burritos, I developed Burrito Vest to insulate my burrito the same way my favorite puffy vest insulates me. Burrito Vest is a solution to my own problem, but if you like getting burritos to go (which is basically our only option in 2020), I think Burrito Vest can help you too.

It will have two bedrooms, two sleeping-galleries for friends or kids, a fireplace and an open kitchen, from where you can watch the wind in the silver trees, while cooking a mushroom risotto.Ми будуємо будинок площею 75 м2, відкритий своєю великою терасою та панорамними вікнами висхідному сонцю та величній річці Дніпро. У будинку будуть дві спальні, дві спальні-галереї для друзів чи дітей, камін та відкрита кухня, з вікон якої ви зможете спостерігати за вітром, що грає у срібних деревах, поки ви готуєте різотто з грибами.The Riverbird's Nest can accommodate four people in full comfort. With kids, friends or surprise-visitors, the little house can easily host up to 8 people.The Riverbird's Nest комфортно вміщає 4 людини, але з дітьми, друзями або раптовими-відвідувачами, маленький будинок може легко розмістити до 8 гостей.Візуалізація вітальні з оригінальним видом.A creative corner calls for writing, drawing and dreaming.Схованка для творчості так і запрошує щось написати, намалювати, або ж просто помріяти. As each room is oriented towards the river, this will be the view from your pillow.Оскільки кожна спальня «дивиться» на річку, таким буде вид з вашої подушки.THE CONSTRUCTION METHODМЕТОД БУДІВНИЦТВАIt's important for us to build our house with ecological materials, but make it safe and strong at the same time. After extensive research, we decided to build the walls with pressed Ukrainian rye-straw-panels, which have a positive eco-footprint and create a perfect climate for the residents of the house . Thanks to a layer of plaster and clay, the walls will be robust and enduring.Для нас важливо побудувати дім з екологічних матеріалів, але водночас зробити наш будинок безпечним та міцним. Після наполегливих пошуків ми вирішили побудувати стіни з блоків з пресованого жита,  виготовлених в Україні, які мають позитивний екологічний слід і створюють ідеальний мікроклімат для мешканців будинку. Завдяки шару гіпсу і глини, стіни будуть надійними і міцним.THE TIMING. РОЗКЛАДEnd of November we carefully poured a solid foundation, which will settle into the ground perfectly over winter:В кінці листопада ми обережно залили міцний фундамент, який за зиму ідеально осяде в землі:In January we will produce the straw-panels in a warm workshop and assemble them as soon as the spring sun rays will warm up Vytachiv. We expect The Riverbird's Nest to be ready for it's first visitors early May 2021.У січні ми виготовимо солом’яні панелі в теплій майстерні. Та як тільки перші сонячні промені зігріють Витачів, змонтуємо їх на ділянці. Ми очікуємо, що "" The Riverbird's Nest "" буде готовий до перших відвідувачів на початку травня 2021 року.THE FIRE: WHY? ПОЖЕЖА: ПРИЧИНИ ТА МАЙБУТНЯ БЕЗПЕКАWho did it? How can we be sure that it will not happen again? Хто це зробив? Як ми можемо бути впевнені, що це не станется знов?It took many weeks to digest this senseless attack. In collaboration with the police, we are investigating the arson. But as the investigation is ongoing, we can not reveal too much information about the case. Багато тижнів пішло на усвідомлення та прийняття цієї дивної атаки. У співпраці з поліцією ми розслідуємо підпал. Але оскільки розслідування триває, ми не можемо розкрити занадто багато інформації про справу.Marc, the original initiator of The Riverbird's Nest, partnered with a kind hearted investor, to start the project. But he was involved in a court-case against a controversial construction in Kyiv. After verbal threats against the co-investor, the construction site was set on fire.Марк,  ініціатор та перший засновник The Riverbird's Nest, співпрацював із доброзичливим інвестором на початку проекту. Він брав участь у судовій справі проти спірного будівництва в Києві. Після словесних загроз будівельний майданчик було підпалено.Afterwards he transferred his shares to our wonderful new partner Andrii Bozhok. With this new constellation,  we are confident that our project is not ""in the line of fire"" any longer.Згодом він передав свою частку в проекті нашому новому чудовому партнеру Андрію Божку. З цим новим партнерством ми впевнені, що наш проект більше не знаходиться ""на лінії вогню"".Despite having experienced the fire, we will never build walls around our little house, set up barbed wire or invite security men with german shepherds, as some friends suggested.  This atmosphere of mistrust and pessimism is exactly what we want our guests to forget, when residing at the house. Instead, we will develop our relationship to all the neighbours, making deeper our connections with residents of the village, who connect to our story and have their watch full eyes on THE RIVERBIRD’S NEST.Незважаючи на те, що ми пережили пожежу, ми не будуємо і ніколи не будуватимемо паркан навколо нашого будиночка, не будемо встановлювати колючий дріт чи наймати охоронців з німецькими вівчарками, як пропонували деякі друзі. Ця атмосфера недовіри та песимізму - саме те, про що ми хочемо, щоб наші гості забули, гостюючи в Riverbird`s Nest. Натомість ми будемо розвивати наші стосунки з нашими сусідами, надалі зміцнюючи зв’язки з жителями села, які співчувають нашій історії та пильнують за будинком.Additionally, we will hire a land-keeper, who will care for all the fruit trees, make small repairs, and maybe guide some of our guests to the best secret fishing spots down by the river.Крім того, ми наймемо помічника, який буде доглядати за усіма фруктовими деревами, дбати про ремонт та слідкувати та лагодити будиночок й, можливо, ділитися з нашими гостями секретами найкращих таємних місць для рибальства.We will care for high occupancy. Enchanted by the picturesque  panorama, the beautiful wilderness and the romantic fire-place, all seasons are perfect for inspiring days at The Riverbird's Nest. We will make sure that the house will never stay empty.Ми подбаємо про те, щоб у будинку завжди хтось знаходився. Завдяки мальовничій панорамі, красі дикої природи та романтичному затишку каміна, усі пори року ідеально підходять для надихаючих днів у Гніздечку.Nevertheless, we will install a modern security system inside the house, which will trigger alarm and call a close-by security team immediately. Разом з тим, ми встановимо сучасну систему охорони всередині будинку. За необхідності, сигналізація спрацює і миттєво викличе бригаду охорони.The Riverbird's Nest will stay free and wild, but will be watched and protected.The Riverbird's Nest залишатиметься вільним і диким, але за ним спостерігатимуть і захищатимуть.ЗАСНОВНИКИ. FOUNDERS.Born in Switzerland, Marc Wilkins is a film-director who moved from New York to Kyiv, inspired by the Revolution of Dignity in 2013-2014. He found his new home in the heart of Kyiv, where he co-founded the gallery for contemporary art THE NAKED ROOM, joined URBAN SPACE 500 and continues creating movies and commercials.

Андрій залучений у різноманітні культурні, соціальні та підприємницькі проекти, переважно видавничі та спрямовані на захист довкілля.ДЯКУЄМО, ЩО ПРИЄДНАЛИСЯ, ПРОФІНАНСУВАЛИ І / АБО ПОДІЛИЛИСЯ В СОЦІАЛЬНИХ МЕДІА НАШОЮ МРІЄЮ ПРО ІДЕАЛЬНИЙ МАЛЕНЬКИЙ БУДИНОК З ВИДОМ НА ДНІПРО.THANK YOU FOR JOINING, FUNDING AND/OR SHARING OUR DREAM OF THE RIVERBIRD’S NEST OVERLOOKING THE DNIPRO RIVERFOR YOU, ME AND EVERYONE WHO SEEKS FREEDOM.

<p> </p></div>","Hello My name is Rory Duckworth. For the last few years, I have been addicted to anything involving running, biking, or swimming. Yeah, I am one of those crazy guys on the side of the road or swimming in the middle of the lake!
On September 21-22nd, I will be racing the 2012 Salt to Saint solo bike race (422 miles). The race has 24 sections, each of which I will be dedicating to what I call a ""Fighter"". This could be a person or organization. My goal is to bring more awareness to the person or organization. All the funds I receive will be donated to a great organization called Peaches Neat Feet. Their mission is simple: to ""hand paint personally customized canvas shoes to lift the 'soles' of children fighting cancer and other life threatening illnesses and lifelong disabilities, to share passion for art and desire to pay it forward."" https://www.facebook.com/PeachsNeetFeet?ref=ts#!/PeachsNeetFeet/info
Your contribution will bring many smiles to kids fighting for their lives. This is important to me because I feel I have an obligation being that I have the time and resources to make this world just a little better.
What We Need & What You Get
I need $500 to give to Peaches Neet Feet. You or your business will be able to sponser a leg of the race (24 legs total) or purchase other ""perks"" associated with my race day. 
Regardless of the amount given, you will have special access to the ""Salt To Saint: Solo Rory Duckworth"" YouTube video before it is made public.
When you purchase a leg you get 1) A video shout out with link to any website. If you choose, you can remain anonymous. 2)Each leg will have a unique story about one of the Peache's Neet feet fighters or another great organization. You will be forever linked to this great organization or person. 3) Signed picture from yours truly with me holding my bike in the air at the finish line.

Hi,
<p>My name is Ari Tapiero, I am a photographer in Ottawa, Canada; my heart and soul is in documentary work, specifically portraits. I work with large format film cameras, 4x5 and 8x10, to get the look and detail I need.</p>
<p>I've been a photographer for 15 years; I've had a few exhibits, notably a solo show in Montreal, where I also produced a book to accompany the exhibit. I've also photographed a coffee-table book about the city of Ottawa.</p>
<p>I've been working on <strong>The Last Jews of Eastern Hungary</strong> for six months now, and I hope to return to Hungary this summer to continue work, as well as expand upon it.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>My Goal</strong></span></p>
<p>For <strong>The Last Jews of Eastern Hungary</strong>, I will produce portraits of individuals or groups who are relevant to the story I am trying to tell.</p>
<p>I will also record videotaped interviews with each person, asking them to recount various aspects of their lives within the context of the Jewish community of their childhood, the Holocaust, and their thoughts about their childrens' futures.</p>
<p>My short-term goal is to complete the photography and interviews this summer in eastern Hungary.</p>
<p>My ultimate, long-term goal is to produce a once-in-a-lifetime book; a beautiful, grand photo book of wonderful portraits and incredible stories, one that will ultimately serve as testament and memory to these people and places.</p>
<p>This will be part one of the series: the Jewish communities of eastern Hungary.</p>
<p>Parts two and three will be devoted to the Jewish communities of western Ukraine and northern Romania, respectively, and photography on those will begin in 2014.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Why It Matters</strong></span></p>
<p> There are sizable, stable and growing Jewish populations in much of western Europe; but what about the east, where the Holocaust claimed the majority of its victims? What happened to the survivors and their descendants in Hungary, Ukraine, or Romania?</p>
<p> I got a small glimpse when I was in Miskolc, Hungary in 2010. My wife is from the town, and our daughter was born there in the summer of 2010. I found an aging, withered, but defiant, tiny Jewish community. They had heard the war stories of their parents, and still feared for their children's future, so they did not continue in their religious traditions. Their children, grown fearful of religious reprisals, have largely gone overseas or married out-of-the-faith, and are thus unable or unwilling to make a Jewish community for themselves and their own children. The resulting sense of finality hangs heavily over this community, as their congregation slowly dies off.</p>
<p> There are other places like Miskolc in eastern Hungary, Ukraine and Romania, and I feel it important to document their existence as a kind of living museum; most of these communities will have disappeared in the next 20-30 years. The small-town eastern European Jewish community, once the backbone of a continent, is on the verge of natural extinction; eventually, only memories and recorded materials will tell us that they existed at all.</p>
<div> It is of vital importance to me to be able to give a sense of what people are (and were) like and how they live as individuals and as a community, in order to preserve that memory for future generations. In essence, this is what being a photographer means to me, and it is both a great responsibility and a great honour.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>I have completed an exploratory version of the project, you can see it here: </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.aritapiero.com/the-last-jews-of-miskolc.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.aritapiero.com/the-last-jews-of-miskolc.html</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Funding &amp; Why I Need It</strong></span></p>
<p> I funded the first part of the project myself, because it was all in the same town, and no travel expenses were necessary. I worked with only eleven subjects, so the first part was relatively easy to do by myself.</p>
<p> I am now looking for outside funding so as to complete the portrait project in eastern Hungary, a much larger region, requiring more time and research. </p>
<p> The money will go to exactly what you see listed here. We will travel through eastern Hungary by car (we have a two-year old), so some of the budget is given over to gasoline.</p>
<p><strong>I am asking for $3600 to complete the project</strong> in Miskolc and other towns or villages in eastern Hungary. This breaks down as follows:</p>
<p><strong>return airfare - $1250</strong></p>
<p><strong>film and processing - $900</strong> (250 sheets of 4x5 colour negative film +  chemicals)</p>
<p><strong>travel expenses - $350</strong> (gas for the car in Hungary)</p>
<p><strong>scanning services - $700</strong></p>
<p><strong>printing - $400</strong> (sponsor gifts, and a print for each participant)</p>
<p> I do all of my own shooting, photo-editing and printing. I do not use an assistant nor do I require funds for room and board. My wife, Zsuzsanna, will be both facilitator and translator. I do not need to buy equipment, just materials.</p>
<p> I expect that this would take about 6-8 weeks of shooting to complete, and 2-3 more months of post-production once we return to Canada.</p>
<p> Should I raise more than my goal, the extra funds will go toward post-production, i.e., scanning, printing, or printing a small version of an eventually larger-scale book.</p>
<p> If I don't reach my goal of $3600, I will likely try and get this done anyway, albeit on a smaller scale and over a longer period of time.</p>
<p> I hope to build momentum with this project, so that I could eventually continue to research and document similarly-affected communities in eastern Europe.</p>
<p> The end result will be a comprehensive book of large format portraits, with accompanying text, on the entire project, with separate sections devoted to each region (Hungary, Ukraine, Romania).</p>

friends and family!</p>
<p>      I
hope you all are doing well! This semester I will be continuing
school at the University of Arizona, still studying psychology and
Russian Language. This summer I have been able to work at United
Christian Youth Camp, which has been one of the best experiences of
my life. At camp, I have been making the videos for the kids, which
includes filming and editing daily videos that I hope will help the
children remember their wonderful camp experience. I'm excited to

<p>      UCYC
partners with many different organizations all around the world every
year and this year we have been raising money all summer for the
Asian Children’s Mission in Myanmar, Asia. We have been raising
funds to help facilitate the orphanage they have there, as well as
provide food, clothing, simple necessities like a toothbrush and
toothpaste, a Christian education, and most importantly mosquito nets
to prevent malaria, which is one of the biggest health concerns for
children and adults in that region. 
</p>
<p>      I
am writing you today because I have been given the opportunity to
travel to Myanmar this November to care for the children and help in
the orphanage, as well as help set up an aquaponics filtration system
that will provide clean drinking water, as well as provide the
ability for the Myanmar people to grow and supply their own food and
resources.

<p><u>Your

<p>I
am writing you, my friends and family, to first and foremost ask for
prayer! Prayer for the country of Myanmar and the people, prayer for
the orphans who have lost their families to malaria and the horrible
typhoons that have hit southern Asia, prayer for the teams that go to
Myanmar and spread the gospel to these amazing children and Myanmar
people, and prayer for the opportunity for me to be able to travel to
this amazing country and to be the light of God’s love. 
</p>
<p>      The
second area of support is financially. The only way I and my team
will be able to travel to this great country and help these amazing
people is by the financial support from my friends and family! We

<h3><b>Who We Are</b></h3>
<p>Portland is known for its majestic surroundings, bearded residents drinking micro-brews . . . and bicycles. Since moving to Northeast Portland last year, we've been working to bring fun, innovative Jewish content to the city of Roses, with distinctly Portlandian twist.</p>
<p>Last year we brought the Pedisukkah to Portland for the holiday of Sukkot. Part Sukkah, part bicycle, the Pedisukkah was an instant success. Visiting various locations around the city, people flocked to us, taking pictures and sharing them with their friends.</p>
<p> This year we're bringing the Pedisukkah back! Redesigned for use for the entire year and reborn as ""The Mitzvah Bike,"" we expect to serve as a mobile means for building community here in Portland.

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Each Mitzvah Bike is built to order and personalized with custom-wraps and specialy modified for each holiday. Though its spirit may be in Portlandia, the Mitzvah Bike is born in Brooklyn, so we'll need to ship it out to the West Coast. (Unfortunately, biking out wouldn't get us back in time for Sukkot!) We'll also be printing promotional material and some awesome swag (some of which you guys can get as perks!) for those who visit the Mitzvah Bike. We'll need to cover all of these costs to make sure the bike is ready to serve Portland's Jewish community for an entire year.</p>

It is after all where young people go to retire. </p>
<p>Located in Northeast Portland, we're looking to engage our friends and neighbors, to teach Jew and non-Jew alike about the message of the Sukkot holiday and the eternal call to grow in our acts of social goodness.

Portland is known for its majestic surroundings, bearded residents drinking micro-brews . . . and bicycles. Since moving to Northeast Portland last year, we've been working to bring fun, innovative Jewish content to the city of Roses, with distinctly Portlandian twist.
Last year we brought the Pedisukkah to Portland for the holiday of Sukkot. Part Sukkah, part bicycle, the Pedisukkah was an instant success. Visiting various locations around the city, people flocked to us, taking pictures and sharing them with their friends.
 This year we're bringing the Pedisukkah back! Redesigned for use for the entire year and reborn as ""The Mitzvah Bike,"" we expect to serve as a mobile means for building community here in Portland. During the fall it will take to the streets as a Pedisukkah, come Chanukkah, it will be a mobile-menorah. No matter what time of year, we envision a beacon around which members of the Jewish community can convene and connect.

Meet the first DIY wooden drone kits.For drone lovers who want something more than a ready-to-fly drone, we have come up with the best gift for you: Aerowood, a wooden DIY drone that can be customized according to your preferences and be built completely from scratch.Rediscover the world with Aerowood! The world is beautifully different from a new angle. Don’t underestimate the power of Aerowood by the simplicity of its look. Aerowood is equipped with sophisticated technologies including 720P HD camera, real time transmission, one key return, and stable hovering technologies.                        
                                                  
Note: For trademark conflicts, we renamed our product from Airwood to Aerowood.Also Featured in  The drone kit contains nothing else but 184 pieces of safe and eco-friendly wooden components that are approved by the FSC. The drone is to be assembled like a 3D jigsaw puzzle with wood joinery mortise and tenon joints. You won't need any glues or nails to interlock the parts.  Upgrade to the 4-in-1 Kit to get a comprehensive DIY experience with Aerowood! The kit offers the four most popular frame settings: NINJIA, TAIJI, SOPHON, and CUBEE. There are many more possibilities in terms of frame settings for you to explore. Each setting comes with a unique flying experience. Keep on exploring! The 4-in-1 Aerowood Kit is equipped with one remote control and two sets of batteries, allowing you to switch among 4 frame settings. Not only are you able to DIY your own drone but also your own remote. The remote, equally as eco-friendly as the aircraft body, is also made up of renewable and recyclable parts.  If you want to have complete control over your drone, or take your flying experience to the next level,  build your own remote to fly like a pro!                                                       
If you are new to drone engineering like many others, the biggest obstacle may be getting your hands on your first drone. But with Aerowood, you don't have to go through a learning curve! Here is the step-by-step instruction:
Take out the parts from the main board
Follow the instructions to assemble the aircraft and remote 
Install a flight control module
(optional) To make your drone unique and colorful, you can even paint on the drone!
Equipped with a 720P HD Camera and real-time transmission, Aerowood synchronizes high-quality images and videos onto your device in seconds. With a slight change in perspective, everything looks so beautifully different from what you see at ground level.To make your flying experience smarter and easier, Aerowood can automatically return to its home location in one click. Even if Aerowood flies out of its range under Safe Mode, or if the aircraft encounters a signal loss, it is still capable to return to its initial starting point.                                  Aerowood can hover perfectly in air with no drifting, holding both position and altitude at the exact level you command. You can set height and distance limits to keep your flights within a safe range. If you command your drone to fly beyond your set limits, the drone will cease from going further once it hits the limits. If Aerowood detects no signal, it automatically returns to your initial starting point. You don't have to worry about losing your drone when it is smart enough to find its way home. With a minimalist wooden design, we manage to bring down the weight of the aircraft to 79g.
