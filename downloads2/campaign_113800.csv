<h4>
</h4><h4>El proyecto</h4>
<p>Coto de Caza es un fotolibro peruano que
relata la experiencia personal del joven fotógrafo Juan Yactayo Sono dentro de lugares ilícitos
de intercambio homosexual anónimo en Lima, Perú. </p>
<p>Con imágenes registradas durante dos años
con una cámara celular, y la reproducción de conversaciones reales dentro de
grupos de internet privados,  este libro
nos sumerge en un recorrido que refleja la vorágine de sensaciones, emociones y
experiencias del autor al ingresar a estos lugares en busca de su propia
identidad, de su sexualidad, del poder sobre otros y sobre sí mismo. </p>
<h3>Queremos que nos des tu apoyo para
imprimir 500 ejemplares de este libro y pagar a todo el equipo de edición y
diseño que ha colaborado en este largo y fascinante proceso. </h3><div><br/></div>
<h4>La cacería comienza</h4>
<p>Este proyecto consistía inicialmente en documentar las dinámicas
que se llevaban a cabo dentro de estos espacios ilícitos, escondidos,
clausurados y reabiertos nuevamente cientos de veces, y sometidos a prejuicios
violentos e invasivos de parte de la sociedad civil y de las leyes peruanas.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, dentro del Laboratorio editorial revisamos durante
ocho meses más de 500 fotografías y muchas conversaciones de chats privados, y logramos
que el libro nos transporte no solo hacia estos espacios, sino también hacia el
miedo, la soledad, la sorpresa, la excitación e incertidumbre del propio autor.</p>
<h3><b>“En ese momento era uno más de ellos. Era parte e incluso centro
de lo que estaba pasando en ese cuarto. Sonreí.” Juan Yactayo Sono</b></h3>
<p>En PPS valoramos los procesos humanos porque consideramos que
son vitales para la creación artística. Un libro es un espacio idóneo para
transmitir, compartir e involucrar a los lectores  con diversas realidades. Nos sentimos
comprometidas con los artistas emergentes y con trabajar temas importantes para
nuestra sociedad. </p>
<p>Queremos que Coto de Caza llegue a la mayor cantidad de lectores
en el mundo para dar a conocer una experiencia humana pero también muy
universal, y de esa manera seguir visibilizando a la comunidad LGBT de nuestro
país.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of My Book</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Endless in August </i>is the tale of a bachelor father and his daughter, Gracie, who set out on an adventure every August to connect through one thing: fly fishing. Gracie has a gripping realization after being told that the Mayfly only lives for 24 hours, and after enduring a tragedy, recollects everything she was taught about life to make a monumental decision. It's an art-centric, coming-of-age story that will test your emotions and question your opinions on aging, mortality, and the world around you.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584161253/xyce2sd8cz7l5meu50yu.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>My name is Taylor Kickbush and I’m the author of <i>Endless in August</i>. The inspiration for this novel is derived from a culmination of things, including but not limited to: a man I met at a bar, a spontaneous birthday trip, a kayaking adventure, and a car accident. After all of these happenings, in that order, I was left asking one question:</span></p>
<p><i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The uncertainty of death is frightening, isn’t it?</span></i></p>
<p>I've spent much of my life in fear, pursuing the answers to certain questions. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In fear of the discovery of what is true; in fear of diminishing time; in fear of the final deadline. When asked if death terrifies me, even after so many years of going to church and being aware that there is an end, I admittedly didn’t have any clue how I felt about it. That is, until I was hurling down a thruway on August 1, 2019, and endured a car accident that could have easily killed me. I left the scene certain that I was not ready to die. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Tell me: what if you knew today that you’d be saying <i>au revoir  </i>to this world? Would you take any chance you could to further extend your life? Are we in such fear of death that we’d do anything to postpone it? </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover some answers to the grander questions we all have about life. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for self-discovery and comprehending mortality. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you unravel your own beliefs about life and death.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">You will love this book if you enjoy having a deeper connection with characters—if you enjoy laughing, loving, and crying with them. It is my wish that you grow to feel for Benjamin and Gracie, just as they would feel for you.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - <i>Endless in August</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 21 chapters, each with a unique flavor that adds to the overall story.<br/><br/>In the beginning, you are introduced to three of the main characters: Ben, a soon-to-be bachelor father; Gracie, his daughter; and her imaginary friend, Jack. The three of them are on their annual fishing trip where Ben finally has the opportunity to connect with his daughter over a common interest: fly fishing.<br/><br/>In the next few chapters, you’ll read along with Ben’s off-the-cuff sense of humor and his unique occupation, learn about Gracie’s quirks, and get to know Ben’s artistic wife, Naomi. A scene between Ben and Naomi in Chapter 8 becomes a catalyst for the remainder of the story.<br/><br/>Chapter 10 involves a small, but necessary, time-hop. You will learn how Gracie and Ben grow and how, both physically and mentally, life is changing them. These growth-centric chapters continue until Chapter 14, where we dive deeper into the muck that Gracie starts to feel as an early teen.<br/><br/>I cried writing Chapter 16.<br/><br/>Chapters 17 through 21 are truly focused on Gracie and a new character I can’t wait for you to meet, who introduces her to the biology of the Mayfly and what small impacts a change in genetic code can mean for her understanding of life, death, and letting go.</p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Endless in August is the tale of a bachelor father and his daughter, Gracie, who set out on an adventure every August to connect through one thing: fly fishing. Gracie has a gripping realization after being told that the Mayfly only lives for 24 hours, and after enduring a tragedy, recollects everything she was taught about life to make a monumental decision. It's an art-centric, coming-of-age story that will test your emotions and question your opinions on aging, mortality, and the world around you.
My name is Taylor Kickbush and I’m the author of Endless in August. The inspiration for this novel is derived from a culmination of things, including but not limited to: a man I met at a bar, a spontaneous birthday trip, a kayaking adventure, and a car accident. After all of these happenings, in that order, I was left asking one question:
The uncertainty of death is frightening, isn’t it?
I've spent much of my life in fear, pursuing the answers to certain questions. In fear of the discovery of what is true; in fear of diminishing time; in fear of the final deadline. When asked if death terrifies me, even after so many years of going to church and being aware that there is an end, I admittedly didn’t have any clue how I felt about it. That is, until I was hurling down a thruway on August 1, 2019, and endured a car accident that could have easily killed me. I left the scene certain that I was not ready to die. 
Tell me: what if you knew today that you’d be saying au revoir  to this world? Would you take any chance you could to further extend your life? Are we in such fear of death that we’d do anything to postpone it? 
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover some answers to the grander questions we all have about life. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for self-discovery and comprehending mortality. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you unravel your own beliefs about life and death.
You will love this book if you enjoy having a deeper connection with characters—if you enjoy laughing, loving, and crying with them. It is my wish that you grow to feel for Benjamin and Gracie, just as they would feel for you.

The Book - Endless in August

The book is written in 21 chapters, each with a unique flavor that adds to the overall story.In the beginning, you are introduced to three of the main characters: Ben, a soon-to-be bachelor father; Gracie, his daughter; and her imaginary friend, Jack. The three of them are on their annual fishing trip where Ben finally has the opportunity to connect with his daughter over a common interest: fly fishing.In the next few chapters, you’ll read along with Ben’s off-the-cuff sense of humor and his unique occupation, learn about Gracie’s quirks, and get to know Ben’s artistic wife, Naomi. A scene between Ben and Naomi in Chapter 8 becomes a catalyst for the remainder of the story.Chapter 10 involves a small, but necessary, time-hop. You will learn how Gracie and Ben grow and how, both physically and mentally, life is changing them. These growth-centric chapters continue until Chapter 14, where we dive deeper into the muck that Gracie starts to feel as an early teen.I cried writing Chapter 16.Chapters 17 through 21 are truly focused on Gracie and a new character I can’t wait for you to meet, who introduces her to the biology of the Mayfly and what small impacts a change in genetic code can mean for her understanding of life, death, and letting go.

What I Need & What You'll Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020
The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer

When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish
The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover
and a personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book

<p>Hi, I'm Lincoln!</p>
<p>I'm an author of horror and science fiction books and I love to tell ridiculous and wild stories. I've written over twenty books throughout my life under three different pen names. The first book I published was when I was fourteen years old. The only thing I remember about it is that it was a lot of fun, but the final result was terrible. I had no idea what I was doing, no guidance, and it was far from a finished project.<br/><br/>Since then, I've written five horror novels, several space operas and techno thrillers, and even a couple of literary books about social issues in America. The genres I write are all over the place, but in general I stick with horror, science fiction, and thrillers (and best case scenario is when I can do all three at once!).<br/><br/>My newest book-in-progress fits firmly in the techno thriller genre, and it's one I have been working on for several years. It's adapted to changes in my writing style and the kinds of stories I want to tell, and whenever I think about it I get excited. I love the technology of the Crispr/Cas9 system and the implications for our future as humans. It represents a leap forward unlike anything we've seen before, and the possibilities are endless.<br/><br/>However, wrapped inside that are social issues and philosophical issues about what it is to be human. We are already using this new system around the world to engineer new traits into animals and considering its applications in fighting off genetic diseases...how long will it be until we are using it to engineer our own humanity?</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>My name is Charlie Collins - and I have wrestled with the idea of honor in a wide variety of contexts. Through all of that wrestling, I believe I have gained some insights into what it means to behave honorably - and it is important to me to share those thoughts, so that others will have a chance to reflect on them and respond with ideas of their own.</p>
<p>In addition to that primary goal, I also want to explore an alternative approach to publishing. I want to get this book into the public domain, so that it can help foster discussion - so what I am asking is that you help to support this approach to publishing. By supporting this sort of effort directly, contributors make it possible for authors to consider releasing their work in this way, rather than managing copyrights.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In simple terms, here is what I am asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>I really want to get this book out, so I am setting my target at $1000.</li>
<li>However, I hope contributors see the value of this approach to publishing - so I am secretly hoping to exceed that goal, to make it feasible for authors to consider looking for support this way.</li>
<li>If I make my goal, this book will be available for you to read and share - I hope it will foster a lot of discussion and reflection.</li>
<li>There also are a lot of nice perks - have a look!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is truly valuable:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be helping to make available an important driver for conversation.</li>
<li>You will be demonstrating that authors can consider new ways of sharing content.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I tend to be pretty cautious, so this book is completely drafted, and has been through a couple of editing cycles. I plan to go through at least one more, to try to minimize mistakes (not eliminate - minimize; see the ""flawed copy"" perk . . .). There are some other minor tasks - I still need to see the cover completed and make sure that I have book numbers and copyright notices and that sort of thing. However, I am confident that I will be able to complete those things before the campaign is finished - I have been through the process with other books, before. (BTW, those are available through the perks, if you are interested!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if contributing is not the right thing for you, for whatever reason, please spread the word! This process works best when lots of people are involved. Worth considering is that you never know who might be interested in what this campaign has to offer - so please use the Indiegogo tools let people know, so that they have a chance to decide.

<p>Would you guess that someone who was born and raised in south Florida—a girl who eagerly climbed on the roof of her house to spot Saturn V contrails and first-stage separations of the Apollo missions—would grow up to write page-turner crime fiction novels set during the American Revolution?   </p>
<p>I hated history the way it was taught in high school: gutted of all the cool stuff, reduced to facts and dates so I remembered it the wrong way. When I was younger, I wrote a lot of paranormal suspense and science fiction out of protest.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, the siren of American history called to me, especially the Revolution. Maybe because of those early telescopes, microscopes, even a submarine—and brave people harnessing the power of wind to travel, make the world a smaller place. Maybe because I seldom heard a tourist get Florida’s pre-19th-century history right. But <em>surely</em> because I knew propaganda when I smelled it, and high school history in the public schools had been full of propaganda about the American Revolution.</p>
<p>All right, admit it. When you think of the Revolution, you imagine bewigged, boring men who spout unintelligible political philosophy—right? And who wants to slog though <em>that</em>? When you read fiction, you want to be immersed in another world. You want to <em>escape</em>.</p>
<p>I’m on a mission to make the American Revolution accessible and fun for you. For twenty years, I’ve researched this war. <a href=""http://www.suzanneadair.net/2018/02/24/my-time-machine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A decade of that time, I was a Revolutionary War reenactor, so I know the look, smell, taste, feel, and sound of the period.</a> I give you realistic, relatable characters, tightly plotted drama, and thrilling history. You’ll feel like you’re there. Even better, you’ll never miss the 21st century.</p>
<p>Because I write each Michael Stoddard American Revolution mystery as stand-alone, even though it’s part of a series, you won’t get lost by reading the books out of chronological order. You can jump right into <i>Killer Debt</i>, if you like. But the first three books have a track record of earning high-star reviews, so you’ll want to read them.</p>

<p>Here are examples of what readers say about them:</p>
<p>""A time machine to another time and place by masterful storyteller Suzanne Adair."" — Midwest Book Review (<em>Deadly Occupation</em>)</p>
<p>“With a few deft strokes, [Adair] re-creates a time when the world was lit by a few candles and traveling from Wilmington to Hillsborough took five grueling days on horseback.” — <em>The Wilmington Star-News</em> (<em>Regulated for Murder</em>)</p>
<p>“Wonderfully complex characters and a fascinating story line are coupled with terrific writing.” — Great Historicals (<em>A Hostage to Heritage</em>)</p>
<p>The Stoddard books have also won some accolades. <em>Suspense Magazine</em> put <em>Regulated for Murder</em> on its “Best of 2011” list. And <em>A Hostage to Heritage</em> won the Indie Book of the Day Award.</p>

I enjoy meeting readers!</p></div>","Would you guess that someone who was born and raised in south Florida—a girl who eagerly climbed on the roof of her house to spot Saturn V contrails and first-stage separations of the Apollo missions—would grow up to write page-turner crime fiction novels set during the American Revolution?   
I hated history the way it was taught in high school: gutted of all the cool stuff, reduced to facts and dates so I remembered it the wrong way. When I was younger, I wrote a lot of paranormal suspense and science fiction out of protest.
Somehow, though, the siren of American history called to me, especially the Revolution. Maybe because of those early telescopes, microscopes, even a submarine—and brave people harnessing the power of wind to travel, make the world a smaller place. Maybe because I seldom heard a tourist get Florida’s pre-19th-century history right. But surely because I knew propaganda when I smelled it, and high school history in the public schools had been full of propaganda about the American Revolution.
All right, admit it. When you think of the Revolution, you imagine bewigged, boring men who spout unintelligible political philosophy—right? And who wants to slog though that? When you read fiction, you want to be immersed in another world. You want to escape.
I’m on a mission to make the American Revolution accessible and fun for you. For twenty years, I’ve researched this war. A decade of that time, I was a Revolutionary War reenactor, so I know the look, smell, taste, feel, and sound of the period. I give you realistic, relatable characters, tightly plotted drama, and thrilling history. You’ll feel like you’re there. Even better, you’ll never miss the 21st century.
Because I write each Michael Stoddard American Revolution mystery as stand-alone, even though it’s part of a series, you won’t get lost by reading the books out of chronological order. You can jump right into Killer Debt, if you like. But the first three books have a track record of earning high-star reviews, so you’ll want to read them.

Here are examples of what readers say about them:
""A time machine to another time and place by masterful storyteller Suzanne Adair."" — Midwest Book Review (Deadly Occupation)
“With a few deft strokes, [Adair] re-creates a time when the world was lit by a few candles and traveling from Wilmington to Hillsborough took five grueling days on horseback.” — The Wilmington Star-News (Regulated for Murder)
“Wonderfully complex characters and a fascinating story line are coupled with terrific writing.” — Great Historicals (A Hostage to Heritage)
The Stoddard books have also won some accolades. Suspense Magazine put Regulated for Murder on its “Best of 2011” list. And A Hostage to Heritage won the Indie Book of the Day Award.
The Impact

Did you know that the 250th anniversary of the Revolution is right around the corner? Oh, but the “Semiquincentennial” isn’t merely about the Fourth of July 2026. The Revolution was a long war—years in coming and going. Anniversary events may already be happening in your state.
I’m making Killer Debt, book #4 of the Michael Stoddard series, available for pre-order via the perks to give readers, reviewers, and backers access to the book early, before its official release.
And by getting the book to as many readers as possible, my goal is to spotlight to a much larger audience the founding history of America, which serves as the backbone for my series.
I invite you to join Michael Stoddard’s Revolution!

I wrote this book because I am a fashion enthusiast, and I have always been interested in fashion. I grew up flipping through Vogue and watching YouTube videos of fashion shows with my mom. In addition to loving fashion, I’m also a major science nerd. I recently graduated with a B.S. in Bioinformatics. In college, I was always in the library studying genetics or organic chemistry. I started to research the merge of these two seemingly unrelated fields and came across Suzanne Lee’s Ted Talk, “How to Grow Your Clothes,” in which she talked about how to grow clothes with bacteria. I found this so fascinating and decided to do more research and write a book.  <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how biotechnology is impacting the fashion industry. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for biotechnology and fashion. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you change your perspective on the relationship you have with your clothes.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about different biological tools and biofabrication projects:</p><p>Biofabrication - how it is poised to change the fashion industry, and what designers and scientists have already accomplished</p><p>Bacteria’s potential of production - while bacteria are microscopic, they are nature’s perfected tools, and we have more use for them than we realize. </p><p>Changing your relationship with your clothing - the fast fashion industry has perpetuated the cycle of wear and dispose, biofabrication presents another alternative: wear and biodegrade</p><p>You will love this book if you love fashion, biotechnology, and are interested in creating a more sustainable fashion industry.<br/><br/>Fashion’s Biofabrication Revolution is a non-fiction book that speaks to fashion enthusiasts and scientists who are looking at the fashion industry and biotechnology for the first time.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book - Fashion’s Biofabrication Revolution</h2><p>The book is written in 4 Parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-3. This section explores the fashion industry in the past, present, and future. You will learn about how the fashion industry in America has evolved and how biofabrication will further change it. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>contains Chapters 4-8. This section highlights projects and companies that are using biofabrication to create alternatives to leather, textile, and plastics. You will learn about how companies are utilizing nature's blueprint and catering it to create these products. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 9-11. This section focuses on companies that are using biofabrication to create alternative fibers for textiles. You will learn about the alternative resources that startups have began to use to create fibers, like pineapple leaves and seaweed. <br/><br/><strong>Part 4 </strong>contains Chapters 12-15. This section of the book focuses on dyeing textiles with bacteria. You will learn about the different types of bacteria that companies are using to create dyes, and how this saves water and prevents harmful chemicals polluting water sources. </p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

I wrote this book because I am a fashion enthusiast, and I have always been interested in fashion. I grew up flipping through Vogue and watching YouTube videos of fashion shows with my mom. In addition to loving fashion, I’m also a major science nerd. I recently graduated with a B.S. in Bioinformatics. In college, I was always in the library studying genetics or organic chemistry. I started to research the merge of these two seemingly unrelated fields and came across Suzanne Lee’s Ted Talk, “How to Grow Your Clothes,” in which she talked about how to grow clothes with bacteria. I found this so fascinating and decided to do more research and write a book.  My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how biotechnology is impacting the fashion industry. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for biotechnology and fashion. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you change your perspective on the relationship you have with your clothes.In this book, you'll learn about different biological tools and biofabrication projects:Biofabrication - how it is poised to change the fashion industry, and what designers and scientists have already accomplishedBacteria’s potential of production - while bacteria are microscopic, they are nature’s perfected tools, and we have more use for them than we realize. Changing your relationship with your clothing - the fast fashion industry has perpetuated the cycle of wear and dispose, biofabrication presents another alternative: wear and biodegradeYou will love this book if you love fashion, biotechnology, and are interested in creating a more sustainable fashion industry.Fashion’s Biofabrication Revolution is a non-fiction book that speaks to fashion enthusiasts and scientists who are looking at the fashion industry and biotechnology for the first time. The Book - Fashion’s Biofabrication RevolutionThe book is written in 4 Parts....Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapters 1-3. This section explores the fashion industry in the past, present, and future. You will learn about how the fashion industry in America has evolved and how biofabrication will further change it. Part 2 contains Chapters 4-8. This section highlights projects and companies that are using biofabrication to create alternatives to leather, textile, and plastics. You will learn about how companies are utilizing nature's blueprint and catering it to create these products. Part 3 contains Chapters 9-11. This section focuses on companies that are using biofabrication to create alternative fibers for textiles. You will learn about the alternative resources that startups have began to use to create fibers, like pineapple leaves and seaweed. Part 4 contains Chapters 12-15. This section of the book focuses on dyeing textiles with bacteria. You will learn about the different types of bacteria that companies are using to create dyes, and how this saves water and prevents harmful chemicals polluting water sources.  What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h3>1. Tutti and the Terrible Yellow Leaves</h3> <p>One day Tutti the raccoon woke up in his forest and was horrified to see that all his favorite green trees had turned yellow! He was outraged! At first he politely asked them to turn green again, then he yelled and demanded. But nothing worked....</p>

<p><i>""Nastya, my son (4.5 years old) asks to listen to your fairy tale over and over again. His behavior has changed a lot these days. He has become kinder to his brother and started to express his emotions much more calmly.""</i></p>

<h3>1.       Тутти и ужасные желтые листья</h3>
<p>Однажды енотик Тутти проснулся в своем лесу и с ужасом увидел, что все его любимые зеленые деревья пожелтели! Его негодованию не было предела! Сначала он вежливо просил их снова стать зелеными, затем он кричал и требовал. Но ничего не работало…</p>
<p>Каждый из нас сталкивается с событиями, когда что-то идет совершенно не так, как мы хотели.</p>
<p>У маленьких детей таких ситуаций может быть по 100 в день. Это вызывает у них бурю эмоций! Они начинают драться, кричать, падать на пол, устраивать истерики, обзываться и кусаться!</p>
<p>Мы можем попробовать наказать их за это, попытаться объяснить, что так вести себя нельзя. Можем даже пригрозить им “естественными последствиями”… Но быстро поймем, что это не работает.</p>
<p>Как помочь ребенку понимать свои эмоции и выражать их цивилизованно? </p>
<p><i>«Настя, мой сын (4,5 года) просит слушать твою сказку снова и снова. За эти дни его поведение очень изменилось. Он стал добрее к брату, уже не такой агрессивный, и начал выражать свои эмоции намного спокойнее».</i></p>
<p>Узнайте, что помогло Тутти не ударить дерево, когда очень сильно этого хотелось, и как мудрый лесной эльф помог ему преодолеть досаду.</p>
<h3>2.       Why Tutti doesn't like going to bed.</h3>
<p>Evening has come. Which means it is time to go to bed. Tutti doesn't like going to bed. And that's why he doesn't like the evenings...</p>
<p>This is how it begins not only the tale of Tutti the raccoon, but almost every evening in a family with a preschool child.</p>
<p>Oh those ""I'm thirsty,"" ""I'm hungry,"" ""I'm not done playing"" - every time we say it's time to go to bed!..</p>
<p>What is the real reason why kids don't want to go to bed? And how can we help make it easier for them to do that?</p>
<p><i>""Nastya, it's magic! My son fell asleep with a smile on his face 10 seconds after having finished listening to your story!""</i></p>
<p><i>""We use your idea every day now, just making up new variations. Going to bed has become a pleasant adventure. Thank you for the fairy tale!""</i></p>
<p>Beautiful illustrations and a cozy fairy tale atmosphere - thanks to this book, bedtime will be a moment of warm contact for every mom and her child.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620143814/tetiv7ooznonrjobarob.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>2.       Почему Тутти не любит ложиться спать.</h3>
<p>Пришел вечер. А значит, пора ложиться спать. Тутти не любил спать. И поэтому он не любил вечер…</p>
<p>Так начинается не только сказка про енотика Тутти, но и практически каждый вечер в семье, где есть ребенок-дошкольник.</p>
<p>Ох, уж эти «хочу пить», «я голодный», «я не закончил играть» - каждый раз, как только мы говорим, что пора идти спать!..</p>
<p>Почему на самом деле дети не хотят ложиться спать? И как мы можем помочь, чтобы им это проще удавалось?</p>
<p><i>«Настя, это магия! Мой ребенок заснул с улыбкой на лице через 10 секунд после того, как прослушал твою сказку!».</i></p>
<p><i>«Мы теперь каждый день используем твою идею, только выдумываем новые вариации. Укладывание спать стало приятным приключением. Спасибо тебе за сказку!»</i></p>
<p>Волшебные иллюстрации и уютная атмосфера сказки - благодаря этой книге время перед сном станет моментом теплого контакта для каждой мамы и ее ребенка.</p>
<h3>3. Love-you</h3> <p>A tale of how Tutti the raccoon goes to school for the first time. He has waited for this day for so long! But why then, when it was time to say goodbye to his mom, he suddenly clung to her and didn't want to let her go?</p>
<p>It's very difficult for preschool children to experience inner conflict, on the one hand, they want to do something, and on the other, they are scared and just can't let go of their Mom!</p>
<p>This fairy tale will help children cope in situations where they need to say goodbye to an adult they are attached to. For example, when mom or dad leaves for work, or when you have to go to school.</p>
<p>The simple words said by the mother to her baby raccoon have become a magic thread to hold on to, even at a distance. Wherever you are, wherever you go…</p>
<p><i>""I read the story to my three daughters. We have exactly the same problem with the middle one (5.5 years old) every time she needs to go to gymnastics or daycare. The older one is 11 now and I thought she was too old for this kind of story. I was so surprised when she came up to me and said in my ear: ""Mama, why don't you say that to me every time we're saying goodbye?” Nastya, your stories are full of love and warmth, they help mothers find the right words for the child in difficult situations!""</i></p>
<h3>3. Лю-блю</h3>
<p>Сказка о том, как енотик Тутти впервые идет в школу. Он так долго ждал этого дня! Но почему тогда, как только пришло время прощаться с мамой, он вдруг вцепился в нее и не захотел отпускать?</p>
<p>Деткам дошкольного возраста очень сложно переживать внутренний конфликт, когда с одной стороны, хочется что-то сделать, а с другой – страшно и просто невозможно отпустить маму!</p>
<p>Эта сказка поможет детям справляться в ситуациях, когда нужно прощаться с любимым взрослым. Например, когда мама или папа уходят на работу. Или, когда самому нужно идти в садик или в школу.</p>
<p>Простые слова, сказанные мамой своему малышу еноту, стали волшебной ниточкой, за которую можно держаться даже на расстоянии. Где бы ты ни был, куда бы ни пошел…</p>
<p><i>«Я читала сказку своим трем дочерям. Со средней (5,5 лет) у нас именно такая проблема каждый раз, когда ей нужно идти на гимнастику или в садик. Старшей уже 11 лет, и я думала, что она слишком взрослая для таких сказок. Как же я удивилась, когда она потом подошла ко мне и сказала на ушко: «Мама, а давай ты и мне будешь так говорить каждый раз, когда мы прощаемся». Настя, твои сказки полны любви и теплоты, они помогают мамам подбирать нужные слова для ребенка в сложных ситуациях!»</i></p>
<h3>4. Tutti and the snowflakes</h3>
<p>Tutti loves to race, but he has a hard time losing. Not only is he frustrated, but he also gives up and doesn't want to try again.</p>
<p>With the story, the child will be able to live through the emotions that arise when we fail to be the first in everything.</p>
<p>They often keep a child from moving forward and not giving up.</p>
<p>How can we help him to be resilient and go through such difficulties without losing confidence?</p>
<p>A tale about self-love, acceptance, about believing in yourself no matter what.</p>
<p><i>""My daughter (age 6) loves all the Tutti tales. She listens to them every night before going to bed. But for this one I want to say a special thank you. When Lilya listened to it, she said to me, ""Mom, you're the best mom ever! I wouldn't trade you for any other mother!"" It was touching to the point of tears. It was also the same story that helped me resolve a conflict between the kids a few weeks later. They were already starting to cry and fight when I reminded them about Tutti and the snowflakes. As a result, my daughter was able to look at the situation from a different angle.”</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617131717/ugnujayjsfie5tqw9nfc.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<h3>4. Тутти и снежинки</h3>
<p>Тутти очень любит бегать на перегонки, но ему очень сложно проигрывать. Мало того, что он расстроен, так он еще и не хочет пробовать снова.</p>
<p>Через сказку ребенок сможет прожить вместе с героем эмоции, которые возникают, когда нам не удается быть во всем первыми.</p>
<p>Они часто мешают ребенку двигаться вперед и не бросать начатое.</p>
<p>Как мы можем помочь ему быть устойчивым и переживать подобные сложности, не теряя уверенности?</p>
<p>Сказка про любовь к себе, про принятие, про веру в себя несмотря ни на что.</p>
<p><i>«Моя дочь (6 лет) очень любит все сказки про Тутти. Она слушает их каждый вечер перед сном. Но за эту сказку я хочу сказать тебе отдельное спасибо. Когда Лиля ее прослушала, она сказала мне: «Мама, ты лучшая мама на свете! Я бы тоже не променяла тебя ни на какую другую!». Это было приятно до слез. А еще эта же сказка помогла мне через несколько недель решить конфликт между детьми. Они уже начинали плакать и ругаться, как я напомнила им про Тутти и снежинки. Дочка сразу все поняла и смогла посмотреть на ситуацию под другим углом».</i></p>
<h3>5. Tutti and the vanillaberries.</h3> <p>Tutti`s mom woke up very early today. She had a long way to go to Magic Mountain, the only place where vanillinaberries grow. Tutti had been waiting for his mother all day. He imagined he would run happily into her arms. But that was not what happened.</p>
<p>When his mother came back, he turned his head from her and walked away. He did not feel like talking to her, much less hugging her. A very hard emotion! An old friend came to help, a forest elf, who was very wise and knew everything about emotions.</p>
<p>Sometimes our children push us away if we unwittingly hurt them. What is the right way to deal with such situations?</p>
<p>Find out how a forest elf helped Tutti to feel love again.</p>
<p><i>""Nastya, thank you! Read it with my daughter and discussed it. You know what the funniest thing is? It's a fairy tale about me! I was the one who behaved this way toward my husband today! I was talking to him in a cold tone over a seemingly insignificant thing. But I couldn't help it. Your fairy tales help not only to introduce the child to emotions, but also to understand my own”.</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617131747/m4arhln8314to542n9rr.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<h3>5. Тутти и ванилинки</h3>
<p>Мама Тутти проснулась сегодня очень рано. Ей предстоял далекий путь на Волшебную Гору - единственное место, где растут ванилинки.Тутти ждал маму весь день. Представлял, как он с радостью побежит к ней в объятия. Но все произошло иначе.</p>
<p>Когда мама вернулась, он отвернулся от нее и отошел подальше. Ему не хотелось разговаривать с ней, и, тем более, обниматься. Очень неприятная эмоция! На помощь пришел старый друг, лесной эльф, который был очень мудрым и знал все-все об эмоциях.</p>
<p>Бывает, наши дети отталкивают нас, если мы невольно их ранили. Как правильно вести себя в подобных ситуациях? </p>
<p>Сказка о материнской любви, которая способна смягчить любое сердце.</p>
<p><i>«Настя, спасибо! Прочитали с дочкой и обсудили. Знаешь, что самое смешное? Это же сказка про меня! Это я сегодня вела себя так по отношению к мужу! Разговаривала с ним холодным тоном из-за, казалось бы, мелочи. Но ничего не могла с собой поделать. Твои сказки помогают не только познакомить ребенка с эмоциями, но и понять мои собственные».</i></p>

2.       Почему Тутти не любит ложиться спать.
Пришел вечер. А значит, пора ложиться спать. Тутти не любил спать. И поэтому он не любил вечер…
Так начинается не только сказка про енотика Тутти, но и практически каждый вечер в семье, где есть ребенок-дошкольник.
Ох, уж эти «хочу пить», «я голодный», «я не закончил играть» - каждый раз, как только мы говорим, что пора идти спать!..
Почему на самом деле дети не хотят ложиться спать? И как мы можем помочь, чтобы им это проще удавалось?
«Настя, это магия! Мой ребенок заснул с улыбкой на лице через 10 секунд после того, как прослушал твою сказку!».
«Мы теперь каждый день используем твою идею, только выдумываем новые вариации. Укладывание спать стало приятным приключением. Спасибо тебе за сказку!»
Волшебные иллюстрации и уютная атмосфера сказки - благодаря этой книге время перед сном станет моментом теплого контакта для каждой мамы и ее ребенка.
3. Love-you A tale of how Tutti the raccoon goes to school for the first time. He has waited for this day for so long! But why then, when it was time to say goodbye to his mom, he suddenly clung to her and didn't want to let her go?
It's very difficult for preschool children to experience inner conflict, on the one hand, they want to do something, and on the other, they are scared and just can't let go of their Mom!
This fairy tale will help children cope in situations where they need to say goodbye to an adult they are attached to. For example, when mom or dad leaves for work, or when you have to go to school.
The simple words said by the mother to her baby raccoon have become a magic thread to hold on to, even at a distance. Wherever you are, wherever you go…
""I read the story to my three daughters. We have exactly the same problem with the middle one (5.5 years old) every time she needs to go to gymnastics or daycare. The older one is 11 now and I thought she was too old for this kind of story. I was so surprised when she came up to me and said in my ear: ""Mama, why don't you say that to me every time we're saying goodbye?” Nastya, your stories are full of love and warmth, they help mothers find the right words for the child in difficult situations!""
3. Лю-блю
Сказка о том, как енотик Тутти впервые идет в школу. Он так долго ждал этого дня! Но почему тогда, как только пришло время прощаться с мамой, он вдруг вцепился в нее и не захотел отпускать?
Деткам дошкольного возраста очень сложно переживать внутренний конфликт, когда с одной стороны, хочется что-то сделать, а с другой – страшно и просто невозможно отпустить маму!
Эта сказка поможет детям справляться в ситуациях, когда нужно прощаться с любимым взрослым. Например, когда мама или папа уходят на работу. Или, когда самому нужно идти в садик или в школу.
Простые слова, сказанные мамой своему малышу еноту, стали волшебной ниточкой, за которую можно держаться даже на расстоянии. Где бы ты ни был, куда бы ни пошел…
«Я читала сказку своим трем дочерям. Со средней (5,5 лет) у нас именно такая проблема каждый раз, когда ей нужно идти на гимнастику или в садик. Старшей уже 11 лет, и я думала, что она слишком взрослая для таких сказок. Как же я удивилась, когда она потом подошла ко мне и сказала на ушко: «Мама, а давай ты и мне будешь так говорить каждый раз, когда мы прощаемся». Настя, твои сказки полны любви и теплоты, они помогают мамам подбирать нужные слова для ребенка в сложных ситуациях!»
4. Tutti and the snowflakes
Tutti loves to race, but he has a hard time losing. Not only is he frustrated, but he also gives up and doesn't want to try again.
With the story, the child will be able to live through the emotions that arise when we fail to be the first in everything.
They often keep a child from moving forward and not giving up.
How can we help him to be resilient and go through such difficulties without losing confidence?
A tale about self-love, acceptance, about believing in yourself no matter what.
""My daughter (age 6) loves all the Tutti tales. She listens to them every night before going to bed. But for this one I want to say a special thank you. When Lilya listened to it, she said to me, ""Mom, you're the best mom ever! I wouldn't trade you for any other mother!"" It was touching to the point of tears. It was also the same story that helped me resolve a conflict between the kids a few weeks later. They were already starting to cry and fight when I reminded them about Tutti and the snowflakes. As a result, my daughter was able to look at the situation from a different angle.”

4. Тутти и снежинки
Тутти очень любит бегать на перегонки, но ему очень сложно проигрывать. Мало того, что он расстроен, так он еще и не хочет пробовать снова.
Через сказку ребенок сможет прожить вместе с героем эмоции, которые возникают, когда нам не удается быть во всем первыми.
Они часто мешают ребенку двигаться вперед и не бросать начатое.
Как мы можем помочь ему быть устойчивым и переживать подобные сложности, не теряя уверенности?
Сказка про любовь к себе, про принятие, про веру в себя несмотря ни на что.
«Моя дочь (6 лет) очень любит все сказки про Тутти. Она слушает их каждый вечер перед сном. Но за эту сказку я хочу сказать тебе отдельное спасибо. Когда Лиля ее прослушала, она сказала мне: «Мама, ты лучшая мама на свете! Я бы тоже не променяла тебя ни на какую другую!». Это было приятно до слез. А еще эта же сказка помогла мне через несколько недель решить конфликт между детьми. Они уже начинали плакать и ругаться, как я напомнила им про Тутти и снежинки. Дочка сразу все поняла и смогла посмотреть на ситуацию под другим углом».
5. Tutti and the vanillaberries. Tutti`s mom woke up very early today. She had a long way to go to Magic Mountain, the only place where vanillinaberries grow. Tutti had been waiting for his mother all day. He imagined he would run happily into her arms. But that was not what happened.
When his mother came back, he turned his head from her and walked away. He did not feel like talking to her, much less hugging her. A very hard emotion! An old friend came to help, a forest elf, who was very wise and knew everything about emotions.
Sometimes our children push us away if we unwittingly hurt them. What is the right way to deal with such situations?
Find out how a forest elf helped Tutti to feel love again.
""Nastya, thank you! Read it with my daughter and discussed it. You know what the funniest thing is? It's a fairy tale about me! I was the one who behaved this way toward my husband today! I was talking to him in a cold tone over a seemingly insignificant thing. But I couldn't help it. Your fairy tales help not only to introduce the child to emotions, but also to understand my own”.

5. Тутти и ванилинки
Мама Тутти проснулась сегодня очень рано. Ей предстоял далекий путь на Волшебную Гору - единственное место, где растут ванилинки.Тутти ждал маму весь день. Представлял, как он с радостью побежит к ней в объятия. Но все произошло иначе.
Когда мама вернулась, он отвернулся от нее и отошел подальше. Ему не хотелось разговаривать с ней, и, тем более, обниматься. Очень неприятная эмоция! На помощь пришел старый друг, лесной эльф, который был очень мудрым и знал все-все об эмоциях.
Бывает, наши дети отталкивают нас, если мы невольно их ранили. Как правильно вести себя в подобных ситуациях? 
Сказка о материнской любви, которая способна смягчить любое сердце.
«Настя, спасибо! Прочитали с дочкой и обсудили. Знаешь, что самое смешное? Это же сказка про меня! Это я сегодня вела себя так по отношению к мужу! Разговаривала с ним холодным тоном из-за, казалось бы, мелочи. Но ничего не могла с собой поделать. Твои сказки помогают не только познакомить ребенка с эмоциями, но и понять мои собственные».
 
Finances 
$ 25000 is needed to publish a whole series of 5 books

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Running Against the Odds - A memoir about my childhood challenges, disappointments, and rejections that preceded my triumphs as a runner and my historical moment as a coach.  </p>
<p>My name is Desmond Dunham, also known as Coach Dez, and I am the author of Running Against the Odds. I wrote this book to let others know that dealing with trauma or having the odds stacked against you, can strengthen and fuel you to find your victory in life.  Underdogs do prevail!</p>
<p>Running Against the Odds is a reminder that you are not alone with all the challenges that the world presents. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you reconnect to your purpose and to fulfill your goals and dreams.</p>
<p>While reading  this book, you'll learn about how adversity and failure builds character. You'll hear stories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How I learned to become the man of the house at age 11</li>
<li>How one race put me in the back of an ambulance</li>
<li>How my journey to the Motherland deepened my spirit and my sense of purpose </li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you ever felt like the underdog; if you felt like your childhood or life is less than perfect; and if you are seeking your true passion in life.</p>
<p><strong>The book is written in three (3) parts.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 1 (chapters 1-9)</strong> Readers will learn that adversity and trauma don’t define who you are but can reveal the potential you have inside. This all began with my first high school cross country practice, which would change the entire trajectory of my life.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 (chapters 10-15)</strong> Here is where my coming of age story unfolds. Attending Howard University and traveling to South Africa during my senior year would become instrumental in my development and would lay the foundation for how I viewed myself as well as how I would view the world. It is where I would learn the true essence of humility and gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3 (chapters 16-23)</strong> My journey into manhood fueled me to become one of the best coaches in the nation. It would be my challenges and shortcomings that would become my students’ and student-athletes’ inspiration.</p>

It doesn't matter if we like it or not, we are in an unbinding relationship with Mother Earth. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the advocate within yourself and come to terms with unhealthy relationships, both past and present. I also want readers to know that they are not alone in how they feel and what they go through and sometimes confiding in a stranger's words is just what they need. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for love, the environment, and immigration, and so much more, in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you heal yourself and other's around you.In this book, you'll experience:* Relationships/grief* Rebirth/renewal * Political/environmental satireYou will love this book if you are a lover of contemporary poetry.The book is written in 3 Parts....Part 1: The speaker is struggling with relationships around her; romantic and platonic. Her experiences within these relationships, whether they are directly related to her, or she is just a witness to them, makes her go through an abundance of emotions including grief and/or trying to find acceptance with the outcomes of these relationships. Part 2:The speaker goes through a rebirth of relationships and she realizes her negligence to and detachment from the world, which was due to her being distracted by her own personal life. As people, we often do this and are so concerned with what we need to do for ourselves that we do not try to make a difference in the environment and world we live in.Part 3: This section contains political/environmental satire as a result of the speaker's realization in section two. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:* The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2019* The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!* The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)* The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication* The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winterWhen I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish* A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book* Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)* Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback* The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover* I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share experience the experiences of writing my book* And more...About the AuthorTianna Gonzalez is a student at the University of Rochester majoring in Creative Writing with a minor in Biology, while taking pre-requisites to become a Physician Assistant for Pediatrics. Tianna has always been passionate about writing for as long as she could remember. Her interest in poetry did not peak until she was a senior in high school when she took an Advanced Placement American Literature class and wrote her first thoughtfully written poem for the class' poetry unit on the Holocaust. Ever since, Tianna has continued writing poetry as a way to express herself, what she simply could not say, on paper. People always asked her why she is a Creative Writing major if she wants to be in the medical field, and her answer every time is: “any health related program post undergrad wants to get to know who you really are. They want to see below the surface of just the health enriched aspect of you because it makes you stand out in a pool of all Biology majors.” Tianna simply wants to share her love for poetry with others and letting people know you can love two different things that are at both ends of the spectrum. For more information you can connect with Tianna at tiannagonzo@gmail.com and on instagram @tianna.gonzalez.Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:* Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #TheBodysResilience and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.* You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page* Please share my book to 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. Please do this as a text message or Direct Message on social media.Thank you so much of all of your love and support. Thanks again,Tianna Gonzalez",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>    Hi guys!  My name is David Álvarez and I'm a 28 years old artist from Costa Rica. I've worked as an animator for over 8 years on kids series like Artzooka, Elias Rescue Boat and Talking Tom. I 've always loved doing animation, but it took me years to figure out that what I really loved was the whole process of telling stories! So this one comes as my first self writen and illustrated children's book. And together we can make the production of this book a reality!</p>

<h3><strong>What is Kill Your Television?</strong></h3>
<p>Kill Your Television is a short film night screening the work of filmmakers based in North East London. Our mission is to create a community of filmmakers and other creatives around regular screening events. We show shorts of all genres by people of varying levels of experience.</p>
<p>Last year, we held nine events in total and showed 40 films by 33 different filmmakers. Our events have been as much about the screenings, as about giving filmmakers the space to present their ideas, talk about their experiences, and share learnings.</p>

<h3><strong>The publication!</strong></h3>
<p>We are currently working on a publication to celebrate the first year of Kill Your Television.</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to catalogue the films, including extensive credits and information on where to see them online.</li>
<li>In a further attempt to create a platform for filmmakers to share their ideas and learnings, the publication will feature a selection of texts by some of the filmmakers whose films we screened in 2016. There will be case studies, pieces on how they approach production design or working under time constraint, and what they learned from making their first student film.</li>
<li>The design style will follow that of the posters.</li>
<li>We want to distribute the publication at a special launch event in the next two months, and then at future events and arts bookshops.</li>

What YTM is All About
For fifteen years, the Youth in Theology and Ministry program (YTM) at Saint John's School of Theology·Seminary has effectively developed young leaders for church and society. Rooted in the Gospel and guided by the principles of Catholic Social Teaching, we invite youth to commit their lives to the transformative mission of Jesus Christ in our world today.
YTM
is an apprenticeship in Christian living. Our holistic, thirteen-month
curriculum forms a beloved community where youth engage in college-level theology courses, service, justice,
prayer, and vocational discernment—providing young people with the tools they
need to live as disciples of Jesus.
Fifteen years of research reveal that
twenty percent of youth who attend YTM study theology in college to prepare for
leadership in the Church. If you are concerned about the next generation of Christian leaders, we invite you to invest in YTM's mission to transform the Church and the world.




Why We're Here on Indiegogo A key element of the YTM experience is our engagement of young people in college-level theology courses, service sites, and afternoon/day trips in the local area to learn about Catholic Social Teaching and vocation. As you might expect, providing these experiences is no small task, logistically or financially.
This is where you come in!
We want to raise $5000 to cover the costs of transportation for all our Summer Institute experiences and textbooks for the youth theology classes. 




Transportation ($3500):-   Summer I youth spend their afternoons at service sites in the      local community--places like Casa Guadalupe, Boys and Girls Club, and      Mercy Manor (assisted living facility)--every weekday of the Summer      Institute.-   Summer II youth take several afternoon trips throughout the Summer      Institute, including to Catholic Charities in St. Cloud for a tour of their      facility, the local grocery store to learn about food security and economic      justice, and the State Capitol for a meeting with legislators to discuss the      intersection between our faith and political engagement.Theology textbooks ($1000):-   Courses are taught by theologians--primarily professors from the College      of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University.-   Professors assign 1-2 books per course.-   Courses are held for ten days (2 hours per weekday) during the Summer      Institute.-   All youth receive a Catholic Youth Bible at the beginning of their Summer I      YTM experience.Fundraising costs ($500):-   Indiegogo and FirstGiving charge fees for hosting the campaign and      disbursing funds. The fee is higher if we do not reach our goal.-   We need to send out perks! There are costs associated with perk production      and postage.
Additional money raised (beyond our $5000 goal) will go toward a scholarship fund:-   Thanks to the generosity of our Vocation Partners and grant funding from      the Lilly Endowment, every single youth attending YTM already receives      a $1200 scholarship. This leaves approximately $650 to be covered by      each youth and their parish/diocese.-   YTM offers additional scholarships to a limited number of youth each year      based on financial need.-   To ensure that the YTM population mirrors the diversity of American Catholicism      (one of our program goals), we also offer specific scholarships to Hispanic      youth and persons of color.-   More scholarship funding means more youth who can participate in YTM.

<h3><strong>About Flowers of Battle</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Since 2010, <a href=""http://www.freelanceacadempress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Freelance Academy Press </a></strong>has brought readers innovative books, instructional DVDs and rich supporting material in the fields of Historical European Marital Arts. In 2017, we are pleased to introduce our most ambitious project to date:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485974957/neykivfumgbh8huklfvw.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This ambitious project goes well beyond anything we have done before: a four (volume set of illustrated, hard-cover books, combining color, 1:1 facsimiles of the master's original manuscripts; professional, annotated translations, and extensive, peer-reviewed essays. With your help, we can produce a fifth volume covering the inheritors of this tradition.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496778230/jdcpsxckeq3fdq7ywnv8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Few historical fencing masters are as dear as Fiore dei Liberi to the heart of the modern Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) community. Credited by fencing historians as the father of Italian swordsmanship, his magnum opus, il Fior di Bataglia (The Flower of Battle), composed in early 1409, is one of the oldest, most extensive, and most clearly elucidated martial arts treatises from the medieval period.</p>
<p>Four versions of il Fior di Battaglia—the earliest surviving Italian source on the martial arts—survive today and form the basis for the modern study of armizare. Each has important similarities to and differences from each other. The key similarity is the organization of the material, which systematically covers abrazare (wrestling and hand-to-hand fighting),  daga (dagger, with an emphasis on self-defense and armoured combat techniques), spada a un mano (single-handed sword), spada a due mani (two-handed sword), spada in arme (sword used in armour), azza in arme (poleaxe used in armour), lanza in arme (spear used in armour), and finally all weapons a cavallo, or on horseback.  </p>
<p>The key martial techniques, called zoghi or “plays” by Fiore, are identical between manuscripts, but each manuscript contains plays and key information not seen in the others, and each is done in a different artistic style.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496956110/qbdgcakvman6cvqi55ai.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>Status: Ready to print. <br/>Delivery: October 2017</strong></p>

<p>Held by the J. Paul Getty Museum in California, <strong>MS. Ludwig XV 13  </strong>is the largest and most complete of the four surviving manuscripts. Dedicated to the young, bellicose Niccolò d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara, this edition of Fiore's work details the names of his famous students, the five duels he fought against rival masters, and explains in detail the instructional schema he developed to make the work accessible to students. Beginning with grappling, it progresses through the various sub-systems of armizare, ending with mounted combat.</p>
<p>These details all make the Getty Manuscript the most logical and obvious choice for Volume One, which sets the stage for the entire series. It has 183 pages of cutting-edge research, covering:</p>
<ul>
<li>The life of Fiore dei Liberi, his students, and patrons;</li>
<li>Arms and armour in the Getty Manuscript, and their relationship to surviving examples;</li>
<li>Dueling and chivalric culture in Italy at the close of the 14th century;</li>
<li>A detailed analysis of the manuscripts' use of pedagogy, numbers, and metaphor to teach the Art of Arms;</li>
<li>The Flower of Battle's relationship to other medieval combat manuscripts.</li>

<p>Volume Two presents the most well-known of the dei Liberi manuscripts, held in the private collection of the Pisani-Dossi family in Italy. Published in a detailed facsimile by Francesco Novati in 1902, this work was the principal access to Fiore dei Liberi's work until the late 1990s. While it follows the organization of the Getty Manuscript, it yet has a wholly different artistic style and text in rhyming couplets.

<p>Only discovered in the last decade, <strong>MS. Latin 11269</strong> or Florius de Arte Luctandi  was hidden in plain sight within the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. Likely created in the 1420s after the author's death, it is lavishly illustrated in painted figures and is interesting not only for being an example of reverse translation from a vernacular to Latin, but also as an ennoblement of a practical art in literary verse form. The manuscript also differs from two of its predecessors in beginning with mounted combat and ending with grappling on foot—an organization reflective of the knightly duel.<br/><br/>The introduction to this work looks at the rhetorical flourishes and adaptations to the earlier manuscripts, and what it tells us about Fiore dei Liberi's legacy.</p>

<p>Created by artists trained in the same school as the Getty Manuscript, the <strong>Pierpoint-Morgan</strong> MS. is an enigma—incomplete, using similar text to the Getty but the same organizational structure as the Florius, and making no mention at all of Niccolò d'Este.

<p><strong>Where the Money Goes</strong></p>
<p>Like many small presses, we began Freelance using primarily print-on-demand and short-run digital printing. This technology has come a long way, particularly in the realm of black and white and hardcover printing. However, it has its limits, particularly in full-color books. Simply, digital printing is like using a giant laser-printer, laying down toner, rather than ink, which sits on top of the paper. Technological improvements make the quality look much better than previously, but the durability of the book is an issue: deletions (blank spots where the toner was thin) are common, and over time the pages do not age well.<br/><br/>Because of this, the first and foremost cost of this project will be the use of traditional, offset printing for Volume One, which remains the industry standard for doing a high-quality book right. Although the per-book cost is lower, we need to print a minimum of 1000 copies, have them transported and warehoused—and with 8.5 x 11"" books that is a lot of space and a lot of weight.</p>
<p>Our second major cost is the 5000 Euro fee owed to the BNF for world-wide permission to use their scans in print, due at the time of publication.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>What if We Don't Reach Full-Funding?</strong></p>
<p>A fair question!

From there, things become more complicated, with each volume's sales having to fund the next in the series. Based on projected sales and past projects, we are fairly confident that the entire project would be completed, but the timeline could take significantly longer, with at least a year between volumes.</p>

</div></div>","About Flowers of Battle
Since 2010, Freelance Academy Press has brought readers innovative books, instructional DVDs and rich supporting material in the fields of Historical European Marital Arts. In 2017, we are pleased to introduce our most ambitious project to date:

 
 
This ambitious project goes well beyond anything we have done before: a four (volume set of illustrated, hard-cover books, combining color, 1:1 facsimiles of the master's original manuscripts; professional, annotated translations, and extensive, peer-reviewed essays. With your help, we can produce a fifth volume covering the inheritors of this tradition.

Few historical fencing masters are as dear as Fiore dei Liberi to the heart of the modern Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) community. Credited by fencing historians as the father of Italian swordsmanship, his magnum opus, il Fior di Bataglia (The Flower of Battle), composed in early 1409, is one of the oldest, most extensive, and most clearly elucidated martial arts treatises from the medieval period.
Four versions of il Fior di Battaglia—the earliest surviving Italian source on the martial arts—survive today and form the basis for the modern study of armizare. Each has important similarities to and differences from each other. The key similarity is the organization of the material, which systematically covers abrazare (wrestling and hand-to-hand fighting),  daga (dagger, with an emphasis on self-defense and armoured combat techniques), spada a un mano (single-handed sword), spada a due mani (two-handed sword), spada in arme (sword used in armour), azza in arme (poleaxe used in armour), lanza in arme (spear used in armour), and finally all weapons a cavallo, or on horseback.  
The key martial techniques, called zoghi or “plays” by Fiore, are identical between manuscripts, but each manuscript contains plays and key information not seen in the others, and each is done in a different artistic style.  
Status: Ready to print. Delivery: October 2017

Held by the J. Paul Getty Museum in California, MS. Ludwig XV 13  is the largest and most complete of the four surviving manuscripts. Dedicated to the young, bellicose Niccolò d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara, this edition of Fiore's work details the names of his famous students, the five duels he fought against rival masters, and explains in detail the instructional schema he developed to make the work accessible to students. Beginning with grappling, it progresses through the various sub-systems of armizare, ending with mounted combat.
These details all make the Getty Manuscript the most logical and obvious choice for Volume One, which sets the stage for the entire series. It has 183 pages of cutting-edge research, covering:

The life of Fiore dei Liberi, his students, and patrons;
Arms and armour in the Getty Manuscript, and their relationship to surviving examples;
Dueling and chivalric culture in Italy at the close of the 14th century;
A detailed analysis of the manuscripts' use of pedagogy, numbers, and metaphor to teach the Art of Arms;
The Flower of Battle's relationship to other medieval combat manuscripts.

Status: Translation and front-matter complete. Layout pending.Delivery: January 2018

Volume Two presents the most well-known of the dei Liberi manuscripts, held in the private collection of the Pisani-Dossi family in Italy. Published in a detailed facsimile by Francesco Novati in 1902, this work was the principal access to Fiore dei Liberi's work until the late 1990s. While it follows the organization of the Getty Manuscript, it yet has a wholly different artistic style and text in rhyming couplets. Our poetic translation preserves the rhyming scheme of the original Latin and Italian verse, provides a short introduction on the manuscript and its relationship to the other three dei Liberi texts, and includes a full English translation of Novati's original commentary containing extensive research and bibliographic footnotes as an appendix.

Status: Translation in progress, front-matter in progress. Layout pending.Delivery: May 2018.


Only discovered in the last decade, MS. Latin 11269 or Florius de Arte Luctandi  was hidden in plain sight within the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris.

Where the Money Goes
Like many small presses, we began Freelance using primarily print-on-demand and short-run digital printing. This technology has come a long way, particularly in the realm of black and white and hardcover printing. However, it has its limits, particularly in full-color books. Simply, digital printing is like using a giant laser-printer, laying down toner, rather than ink, which sits on top of the paper. Technological improvements make the quality look much better than previously, but the durability of the book is an issue: deletions (blank spots where the toner was thin) are common, and over time the pages do not age well.Because of this, the first and foremost cost of this project will be the use of traditional, offset printing for Volume One, which remains the industry standard for doing a high-quality book right. Although the per-book cost is lower, we need to print a minimum of 1000 copies, have them transported and warehoused—and with 8.5 x 11"" books that is a lot of space and a lot of weight.
Our second major cost is the 5000 Euro fee owed to the BNF for world-wide permission to use their scans in print, due at the time of publication.

<br/></div>","Have you ever wondered how the information collected in Australia’s five yearly Census is used? 
The truth is that governments and planning bodies make all sorts of planning and funding decisions based on how Australians answer the Census questions.That’s why I’m worried about the question about religion in the next Census, coming up in August of this year.To my mind, just because someone was baptised or brought up in a certain religion a long time ago doesn’t necessarily mean that their church is somehow entitled to something more from the average taxpayer.Put simply, just because you were born into a religion, that doesn't mean you have to tick that religion on the 2016 Census.Do you agree?How you can help...
 We need your support in an awareness campaign to promote the consideration and importance of marking 'No religion' on the 2016 census. We hope to get a better and more accurate representation of how religious Australia is.  We are looking to raise $25,000 to put towards buying media so that we can get the message out too all Australian adults.  We have already engaged the services of professional communications experts in both PR and Marketing The AFA is already investing in creating a clear and non biased marketing campaign supported by a strategic PR and media plan. 
   The Impact After successful campaigns in New Zealand and England/Wales, those countries now report a population with nearly 50% of the population identifying as non religious. This is an increase of nearly 25% over the last 5 years.
Your donation today will help Australia get a more accurate representation of how religious the population is. And this will have impact on the future decisions of our politicians and policy makers.
   Together we can reach all Australians With your support this campaign can make it into every Australian home. By getting the message across our cities and towns we'll create a conversation that everyone can be part of. Billboards, Facebook, newspapers and on TV.
We have recruited leading Creative and PR agencies to help create a campaign that will get a great return on your investment and great results.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Above is the actual 2008 Securities Exchange Commission filing at the core of this story which deserves close examination. Buca Inc has exhibited criminal contempt of court, conspiracy, insider trading and fraud.. these offences hidden from the public sector and a federal court judge in Pittsburgh by disbarred and disgraced lawyer Lois E Glanby. While I am myself Pro Se by nature, I am now Pro Se from a legal standpoint having been personally involved with the court system. I speak now on behalf of those intentionally misled Buca investors who owned shares of this stock between the years of 2007&amp; 2010. In retrospect I should have made this public in 2007, but refused out of consideration for the employer. That has all changed, the respect I once had has long ago evaporated. The public should consider me a good old-fashioned  whistle blower. This story actually begins in 2003, with blatant violations of Federal Labor and Immigration Laws having occurred and witnessed in the (re)-hiring of a previously deported illegal immigrant. A letter of complaint (c) 2010 is drafted August 4 2003 and distributed to management and co-workers at the Robinson Township Pennsylvania location. Constructive termination / retaliation is the end result  for this author and his co worker teenage son. Beginning as an employment issue in the Pa UC with perjured testimony having been given under oath, I then proceed to the PHRC in 2004. Armed with collected documentation of the past and conflicting statements having been made by Buca, I eventually enter the Western District of Pennsylvania Federal Court in 2007. Civil Action # 2:07-cv-00242TFM is filed late February and not by coincidence, multi million dollar restaurant chain Buca Inc (BUCA) NASDAQ stock values begin to fall. They continue to do so unchecked until an August 5 2008 press release to the public announced an entry into ""a direct financial obligation and plan of merger, and believe it or not, one month later in September 08 this ""Plan"" is finalized with ""Planet Hollywood International Inc, a Delaware corporation"" (PHWDQ.PK) This is birthplace of Buca Financing LLC, which allows for the continued operation of the restaurant chain Buca Di Beppo. How was this possible, and why was it done while the corporation was Defendant in an ongoing private federal civil matter? Answer: Buca expecting to be found guilty at trial, the fallibility/transparency of internet, incriminating documents and last but not least disbarred lawyer Lois E Glanby, who did in fact effectively place a gag upon me (us) and conceal the true Buca story from the public sector with an electronically filed and never agreed to ""settlement"". Pro Se case 2:12-cv-1748 was filed and has served to make that agreement worthless. Gross Misconduct and Negligence has proven to serve as inspiration for the 2012-2013 actions of Edwin G Hose Pro Se in the Western District of Pennsylvania federal court. Potential readers of this story will be inspired to be self representative in all matters of life. We all strive to possess a clear conscience. This author wishes to teach others how to be Pro Se in today's internet age. An experienced based self help Pro Se website is hoped for in the next year. Consider this scenario, it is mine: If a lawyer enters an agreement in Federal Court contrary to two (2) Plaintiffs' expressed positions of demanding trial, having issued a demand to the the defendant, what would you do when you soon found out? Your employment based case has just been ended electronically within the court, behind your back, as you prepared to pose some very difficult questions to the ""defendant"" who already had plenty to answer. Who would you complain to, what would you do? The defendant has intentionally buried the stock portion of the company because of this action and while actively present in court with a fired worker who was personally involved and an informed investor, witness to the scheme. Under these circumstances how would I manage to find closure? Sue the lawyer? She effectively served as roadblock in between myself and the defendant. Would you or could you, accept it gracefully having been tricked legally by someone you trusted and psychologically violated on this many levels and be able to ""forget it""? No, and neither could I. Since this miscarriage of justice took place, I have refused to carry this living nightmare to my grave, and chose instead to go Pro Se. I chose to do it myself. The illegal immigrant aspect of this story is for you to decide, but its illegality was the original catalyst. It was back then and still is, illegal for employers to hire illegal immigrants. This story reflects my distaste for unscrupulous lawyers and my many sleepless nights. You are cordially invited to click on the web link that is included on this page to view a sampling of my supporting documentation, herein publicly posted to reinforce the above stated allegations.  A corporation that is even remotely guilty of misconduct should no longer be able to expect to find ""safe harbor"" nor refuge through the insidious and deceptive transfer of ownership. The internet and this case serves to make that old school business tactic obsolete. </p><p>                                                                                                                                                                                                       About the

balance, he rose to his feet to assess the situation. Replace the jumped chain
and make a quick trip back to the trailer. Upon further inspection it was soon
discovered that a vital part had been damaged. It was the main shaft, and is
exactly what the title describes. Part number one… the entire motorcycle begins
here. As with everything else he owns, the motorcycle was used, aged and parts
were no longer readily available. The usual response to inquiries concerning
parts was, more often than not, “it has been discontinued” or “is no longer
available”. In this instance part number one needed to be found, but where do
you find such an obsolete item?  </p>
<p>  His two young sons
were eight years apart in age. As part of their school curriculum they had each
had the opportunity to attend classes to learn of the newly introduced computer
and internet that had in recent years been made available to the public. One
day, a computer ended up in the kitchen. His initial opinion was that there was
no real use for it, and to remove it. As he watched his eight year old cruise
in cyberspace he became a little bit jealous. There seemed to be an awful lot
to learn to be able to use this device. It was at that moment that the personal
computer became important for the writer. He remembered hearing on many
occasions that “you can find anything on the internet”. The time had come for
him to test that stated theory for himself, and be required to learn a thing or
two about the computer along the way. One day a search began with the author
typing the words and clicking the mouse. And so it went for six months,
searching for the critical part and learning, until success was realized. After
his first electronic transaction with a small salvage yard in the state of
Georgia, the main shaft was shipped and the motorcycle was once again
transporting one of the three male family members into the solitude and
serenity of the wooded trails.  </p>

  He now sat at the computer with nothing to do, nothing
interesting to search for. He had been impressed by the power and scope of the
computer and internet. He had indeed found something previously thought to be
impossible to find. The question he asked himself at this point in time was,
“what can I research now?”  The
unemployment compensation matter soon came to mind. After several years it had
transformed into a federal civil action in the Western District of
Pennsylvania. The defendant in the case was his former employer, a major
restaurant chain. What had begun as a simple job issue in 2003 had, quite
deliberately, found its way here. With conflicting statements having been made
on record by the employer, and incriminating documentation including corporate
illegal immigrant tax forms having been gathered in the past years, two thoughts
came to his mind. The first being the excitement of having such evidence to
present in court that would shine a spotlight on the immigration problem, and the
second was, how the corporation would conduct themselves on Wall Street and
before the public during the lawsuit. There had been several past occasions at
which time the right thing could have been done by Buca, but never was. At age 55 the
future in stock he had planned for himself ten years ago has been taken from
him and his sleep remains disturbed. He will no longer be able to trust very
well, especially when it comes to lawyers and employers. But more importantly
remains the fact that had it not been for the blessing of sobriety, he would
never have blossomed into the recognized plaintiff pro se that he has become today. He
remains proud yet humble, grateful to God and giving in nature. In all reality
he is self described as being “krill in the sea of life”, but his heart is
pure. In daily life he works 25 hours per week in the personal employ of one
man and his family. Not one day has passed without his receiving at least
verbal appreciation of his service. There is more contentment to be found here
than is possible in most workplaces. Employee stock purchase programs offered
by certain corporations would now appear to be for suckers, from his experience.
America has always been the land of opportunity, and it is upon this distinction
that he has written this story. If there is a future outside of poverty left
for him to earn, it will be a product of this work and his dedication to
standing in defense of his principles, and the laws of this country through his
actions. For now he enjoys and is thankful for, Gods providence.        <p></p></div>","Above is the actual 2008 Securities Exchange Commission filing at the core of this story which deserves close examination. Buca Inc has exhibited criminal contempt of court, conspiracy, insider trading and fraud.. these offences hidden from the public sector and a federal court judge in Pittsburgh by disbarred and disgraced lawyer Lois E Glanby. While I am myself Pro Se by nature, I am now Pro Se from a legal standpoint having been personally involved with the court system. I speak now on behalf of those intentionally misled Buca investors who owned shares of this stock between the years of 2007& 2010. In retrospect I should have made this public in 2007, but refused out of consideration for the employer. That has all changed, the respect I once had has long ago evaporated. The public should consider me a good old-fashioned  whistle blower. This story actually begins in 2003, with blatant violations of Federal Labor and Immigration Laws having occurred and witnessed in the (re)-hiring of a previously deported illegal immigrant. A letter of complaint (c) 2010 is drafted August 4 2003 and distributed to management and co-workers at the Robinson Township Pennsylvania location. Constructive termination / retaliation is the end result  for this author and his co worker teenage son. Beginning as an employment issue in the Pa UC with perjured testimony having been given under oath, I then proceed to the PHRC in 2004. Armed with collected documentation of the past and conflicting statements having been made by Buca, I eventually enter the Western District of Pennsylvania Federal Court in 2007. Civil Action # 2:07-cv-00242TFM is filed late February and not by coincidence, multi million dollar restaurant chain Buca Inc (BUCA) NASDAQ stock values begin to fall. They continue to do so unchecked until an August 5 2008 press release to the public announced an entry into ""a direct financial obligation and plan of merger, and believe it or not, one month later in September 08 this ""Plan"" is finalized with ""Planet Hollywood International Inc, a Delaware corporation"" (PHWDQ.PK) This is birthplace of Buca Financing LLC, which allows for the continued operation of the restaurant chain Buca Di Beppo. How was this possible, and why was it done while the corporation was Defendant in an ongoing private federal civil matter? Answer: Buca expecting to be found guilty at trial, the fallibility/transparency of internet, incriminating documents and last but not least disbarred lawyer Lois E Glanby, who did in fact effectively place a gag upon me (us) and conceal the true Buca story from the public sector with an electronically filed and never agreed to ""settlement"". Pro Se case 2:12-cv-1748 was filed and has served to make that agreement worthless. Gross Misconduct and Negligence has proven to serve as inspiration for the 2012-2013 actions of Edwin G Hose Pro Se in the Western District of Pennsylvania federal court. Potential readers of this story will be inspired to be self representative in all matters of life. We all strive to possess a clear conscience. This author wishes to teach others how to be Pro Se in today's internet age. An experienced based self help Pro Se website is hoped for in the next year. Consider this scenario, it is mine: If a lawyer enters an agreement in Federal Court contrary to two (2) Plaintiffs' expressed positions of demanding trial, having issued a demand to the the defendant, what would you do when you soon found out? Your employment based case has just been ended electronically within the court, behind your back, as you prepared to pose some very difficult questions to the ""defendant"" who already had plenty to answer. Who would you complain to, what would you do? The defendant has intentionally buried the stock portion of the company because of this action and while actively present in court with a fired worker who was personally involved and an informed investor, witness to the scheme. Under these circumstances how would I manage to find closure? Sue the lawyer? She effectively served as roadblock in between myself and the defendant. Would you or could you, accept it gracefully having been tricked legally by someone you trusted and psychologically violated on this many levels and be able to ""forget it""? No, and neither could I. Since this miscarriage of justice took place, I have refused to carry this living nightmare to my grave, and chose instead to go Pro Se. I chose to do it myself. The illegal immigrant aspect of this story is for you to decide, but its illegality was the original catalyst. It was back then and still is, illegal for employers to hire illegal immigrants. This story reflects my distaste for unscrupulous lawyers and my many sleepless nights. You are cordially invited to click on the web link that is included on this page to view a sampling of my supporting documentation, herein publicly posted to reinforce the above stated allegations.  A corporation that is even remotely guilty of misconduct should no longer be able to expect to find ""safe harbor"" nor refuge through the insidious and deceptive transfer of ownership. The internet and this case serves to make that old school business tactic obsolete.                                                                                                                                                                                                        About the

  His eyes opened
and beheld a sapphire blue sky. Thoughts which came to him in the initial
moments of consciousness inspired him to consider the possibility that he was
perhaps about to meet God. He turned his head to see the motorcycle he had been

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Rob Merlino and I am The Hotdogman. For six wonderful years, I owned and operated a hot dog truck (aptly called <a href=""http://thehotdogtruck.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">The Hot Dog Truck</a>). In 2009 I had some health issues that forced me to sell my truck, so I went back to school to get a Master's Degree and a Teaching license. During my new found role as a student, I began expanding on another website I created called <a href=""http://hotdogstories.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Hot Dog Stories</a>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Hot Dog Stories is a website that features photos and videos of my visits to different hot dog establishments in Maine, Florida, Montreal, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Nevada (so far). In July of 2011, I gained national attention for my hot dog eating ""tour."" I ate a hot dog a day at a different venue every day in July 2011 to celebrate National Hot Dog Month. My ""quest"" was featured in The Boston Globe, The Metrowest Daily News, The Fall River Herald, WZLX Radio (Boston's Classic Rock), NECN TV, WCVB TV, UPI, NPR and countless other print, radio and electronic media. National Hot Dog Month 2011 was a huge success.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Hotdogman's National Hot Dog Month Tour will be bigger and better. I want to expand the geographic footprint of the tour in search of hot dog joints of all kinds, from the iconic to the smallest cart at the side of the road in Somewhere Town, USA. </p>
<p>This year, in addition to the daily videos and photo spreads shot at each venue, I want to produce a <b>60-90 minute video documentary</b> of the journey and write <b>a book</b> about it. The book will feature more in depth interviews with each owner and customer and more photos of the tour. I want to make this a yearly event as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, the show will go on with or without full funding. Last year my wife and I financed this venture out of our own pockets which limited the scope and production values. Even so, it was a success; we just want a better, more professional product this year. The closer we get to our goal, the further we will be able to travel.</p>
<p>Some people may think this is a silly idea, but hot dogs are a big part of American culture. The little hot dog cart at the side of the road is something many people simply cannot resist. Each hot dog cart operator is a business person with a story to tell. Hot dog cart operators represent what is best about America: independence, autonomy, individualism, and the spirit of hope. I want to delve into the circumstances that brought each small vendor into the hot dog business. There are/will be many tales of corporate downsizing and people in search of their own piece of the American Dream.</p>
<p>The older, iconic establishments (one has been in business since 1890) we'll visit represent a fading past that it equally important on the American landscape. In this era of big box stores and chain restaurants, the hot dog joint remains a largely independent, local enterprise. This is due to regional tastes and the allure of things from our past. The owner of George's Coney Island in Worcester, Massachusetts- an establishment in business since 1918- said it best: ""we represent a sense of familiarity and stability in an ever changing world."" That's poetic. These iconic businesses show what can be done to create success in an independent business and how the American Dream manifests itself over several generations.</p>
<p>We will endeavor to capture the spirit of the hot dog joint and what it represents to American culture in each video, the documentary film, and the book. We will have fun doing it too. The most funny and poignant moments from each visit usually come from customers- I always like to catch people in the act of being themselves.</p>
<p>We will also talk about the hot dogs. Me and my team will sample hot dogs at each place and offer our frank opinion on the culinary uniqueness of each hot dog eaten. Different hot dog brands, interesting toppings, preparation methods and regional tastes will be examined and each joint will be hoping for the Hotdogman's seal of approval-""two thumbs up.""</p>
<p>When woven into a 60-90 minute film and a book, our goal is to offer a fun but insightful look at Americana through the eyes of hot dog lovers everywhere.</p>
<p>There will be at least two additional short videos associated with this year's quest as well: a ""bloopers and out takes"" video and a video where I collect answers to the age old question: ""do you put ketchup on your hot dogs?""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>On the 2011 tour, we were limited to visiting hot dog joints fairly close to home (greater Boston). We want to expand the geographic footprint of the tour further up and down the east coast this year to get a broader epicurean and cultural cross section for the film and book. More travel means more expenses. We'll need a lot of money for gas, tolls, meals and lodging as we meander through the back roads and broad boulevards of small towns and big cities.</p>
<p>We also need to drastically upgrade our video cameras, microphones, editing software, and editing computers to complete the job properly. We will need the services of a professional production editor to oversee putting the individual episodes and film together. For the final cut, we will need money to pay for music and archival material rights as well. There will also be marketing and production costs for producing a CD of the documentary. The book will require cover design, layout assistance, and a marketing budget.</p>
<p>We'll need money for promotional items for the tour- tee shirts, hats, free products etc. and for buying hot dogs at each establishment for ourselves and participating patrons. There will be legal fees, accounting costs and the inevitable ""unforeseen expenses.""</p>
<p>What the funder will get, besides an expanded knowledge of where to find the best hot dogs in a given region, is a host of perks, exposure and goodies. This is a great vehicle for a sponsor to gain a big bang for their marketing buck. Daily news stories on radio, TV and in newspapers plus two blog posts per day guarantee a sponsor will get tons of visibility for their brand. If you have a product or service that appeals to hot dog lovers or hot dog vendors, supporting this project will put you in front of that audience for an entire month at a fraction of the cost of any other marketing endeavor. What would it cost for a daily newspaper, radio AND TV ad for an entire month? Much more than any of the sponsorship options to the right, that's for sure. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our goal with this project is that it will be the first in a series of video documentaries that catalog, document and celebrate the all American Hot Dog Joint. Future plans include regional tours in different cities around the country where we seek out the most iconic and funky hot dog joints. Certainly being a part of a project that celebrates the hot dog and Americana is something many people will want to get involved in, but extra incentives aren't bad either! See the perks for more info.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even a dollar or two will help get us to our goal, but if you can't give a lot you can help us by spreading the word. Post this page on your facebook wall, tweet about it, blog about it. tell a friend in the news media, talk about it at a party- just spread the word!</p>

Hello! I'm Nancy Stohlman, author of the flash fiction collection The
Vixen Scream and Other Bible Stories (Pure Slush Press, 2014), the novels The Monster Opera (Bartleby Snopes Press, 2013),  and Searching
for Suzi: a flash novel (Monkey Puzzle Press, 2009),  and four anthologies including Fast Forward: The Mix Tape  (Fast Forward Press, 2010) which was a
finalist for a 2011 Colorado Book Award. I am the creator and curator of the Fbomb Flash Fiction Reading
Series in Denver and one of my stories was recently called one of “our
favorite recent pieces of flash fiction"" by the Huffington Post. Yay! My official website



The Vixen Scream and Other Bible Stories (published by Pure Slush Press) is my my first solo flash fiction collection and also my calling card to spread Flash Fiction to new writers and new audiences.
This is the first time that I have had a publisher, Pure Slush Press, offer me the opportunity to join on a multi-city book tour including New York, Boston, Baltimore, San Francisco and Berlin! I will be finishing up as guest of the 6th annual Seattle Lit Crawl in October. Each one of these readings is an amazing opportunity for me to reach bigger audiences and expose more people to not only what I do but also the literary movement that is flash fiction.

Find out more about the Pure Slush Reading Tour
Find out more about the Seattle Lit Crawl
   What I Need & What You Get I'm raising the money for the travel expenses-plane tickets, lodging and meals/incidentals. 
(On that note, I am also quite open to donations of frequent flier miles as well!)
Independent publisher Pure Slush published my book The Vixen Scream and other Bible Stories in late 2014, and I will join other writers published by Pure Slush as the tour crosses the Atlantic and winds its way across the US. My final stop will be to join the 6th annual Seattle Lit Crawl in late October. In addition I have also been approached by promoters who are on board and excited to publicize the US dates and generate continuing interest and media coverage.





MY PROPOSED ITINERARY

August 1--Berlin, Germany

August 29--Boston, MA


September 4--New York City, NY



September 11--Baltimore, MD



September 26--San Francisco, CA



October 22--Seattle, WA 

Estimated travel, lodging, and meals (conservative)
Berlin--1500
Boston--600
NYC--600
Baltimore--600
San Francisco--600
Seattle--600
Promotion--500
If I don't reach my entire goal I will prioritize cities. I will go to as many cities as I can fund!   The Impact I love indie publishers, and I have been publishing books with Indie Publishers since 2003--the only drawback is that funding for promotion and promotional events comes out of my own pocket. As you might recall, I have traveled and done readings for all my former books, and much of this has been on my own initiative and always on my own dollar.
Over the last 12 years I have traveled as much as my budget has allowed me, including New York, Chicago (twice), Portland (twice), Santa Fe, Minneapolis, Omaha, Salt Lake City, and the Aspen Lit Fest as a panelist, not to mention all along the front range. I donate as much of my time as possible because I believe in my work and want to expose it to the greatest audience possible.  Here I am reading in Santa Fe in January of this year:

    Risks & Challenges Stepping out and asking for support is always a risk, and I appreciate your consideration! That said, I will not buy plane tickets or make travel arrangements until I know how much is funded, so there will be no risk that I will receive monies and not show up. at promised events. I will keep everyone posted as the monies come in and as I secure travel plans. My biggest challenge is making sure I don't wait too long and pay higher than normal plane ticket fees, so that is why I am creating the campaign now!
    Other Ways You Can Help Do you have frequent flier miles? Hotel vouchers? I would be thrilled to accept these as donations as well.
Come and see me at any of these book tour dates! I would love to give you a hug.
And I would love your help in getting the word out and making some noise for me. You can use the awesome Indiegogo share tools on this page to post to your social media sites, websites, or emails. Thank you so much in advance!",3.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p>I began writing this book around the first of the year.  What I didn’t expect at the time was how God would use this process to speak to me in such dynamic and powerful ways.  It’s as if every time I sit down to write, God shows up and amazes me!  He takes control and writes through me and to me.  So many of the lessons I write about aren’t just lessons for my sons.  They’re lessons for me as well.  </p>
<p>From the very first day I realized these little “lessons” could be helpful for others, too.  As such, I began to share them via email with a small group of friends and colleagues.  That group of “readers” began to grow to the point that I eventually decided to develop a “blog” site (the website shown above) to get the letters out there.</p>
<p>Other than the desire to share these biblical principles and spiritual truths with my sons, it’s my sincere desire, my hope, to share these letters, these little life lessons, with others in order to point them to Christ and to help them as they live their lives.  Although I know in our world today there are numerous options for obtaining and reading (or even listening to) books electronically, I also realize there are certain circumstances where the actual hard copy is necessary. </p>
<p>So, I’m moving forward with the completion of my book for those folks that might want, or need, a copy someday – folks that serve our country on foreign soil as soldiers, marines, sailors and aviators; folks that may not have the availability or the inclination to own a computer, a tablet or a cell phone; or folks that might find themselves in the unfortunate position of serving time in prison.  There are also a lot of us that just enjoy holding an actual book in our hands as we read it.  </p>
<p>Since I work full time in another profession and since I still need to maintain my responsibilities as a father and a husband, I’m only able to complete a letter every week or two.  It’s been a slow, yet rewarding, process.  My goal, though, is to finish the book this year, preferably by Thanksgiving.  However, after talking to some self-published authors, I’ve discovered that probably won’t happen given my current pace and all that needs to be done to edit the book, get it into the proper format and get it published.  What I’m hearing is that process often takes a lot longer than the time it takes just to write a book.  </p>
<p>That’s why the thought for this “campaign” came about.  I feel a sense of urgency to complete the book as soon as possible.  I think there are a lot of people out there in some of those “certain circumstances” I mentioned earlier that could benefit from reading this book sooner than later.  And I think I’ve come up with a plan to make that happen.  I just need your help.  If you’d be willing to join me in this effort by pre-purchasing the book and/or making a pledge for a larger contribution with additional perks, if I can reach the goal I’ve set, or, at least, get close to that goal, I can take some time off work to finish writing the book and get it published.  Please consider helping at one of the levels listed here.  </p>

By donating 20% of the sales to Seattle Children’s Psychiatry Unit we are shining a light on childhood mental illness, an issue too often kept secret and stigmatized.</p><p>Our goal is to raise acceptance, to end the isolation families experience because of this tragic disease, and to bring laughter to those children marginalized by the seriousness of it</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why pediatric psychiatry?</strong></p><p>Childhood mental illness has directly impacted my family; first with my brother, and now with my only child. In a period of four months, my son went from the top 10% of his freshman class to bedridden and suicidal. We were shocked and devastated by this downfall.</p><p>I have seen, first-hand, how childhood mental illness consumes a family’s focus, how it isolates, how emotionally exhausting it is. Childhood mental illness causes an extra layer of conflict and tension, for it is easily dismissed by others – even from within the family – because the damage isn’t on the outside. It isn’t visible to the untrained eye, so that when a crisis erupts it is confusing and frightening. I've had friends abandon me due to the fear and stigmas still attached to the disease of mental illness.</p><p>I am compelled to change the world. Other families are hurting, other children are left behind. Childhood mental illness is not contagious. It’s nobody’s fault. It has nothing to do with ethics or morals or being a good person. It is simply a disease, like any other.</p><p>Volunteerism and philanthropy have been a part of my life since early childhood. I am deeply honored, humbled, and forever grateful to use the platform of <i>The Other Mermaid</i> for the greater good.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why now?</strong></p><p>I spent many years managing doctors, therapists, and endless crises. I supplemented part-time work with commission-based direct sales. I’d been in survival mode for so long that when asked what I did really well … well, I couldn’t remember. So, when a challenge arose from eWomenNetwork to do something uniquely me, I grabbed ahold of it like a lifeline.</p><p>That was nearly 8 months ago. Miraculously, <i>The Other Mermaid <i>was just sent to the printers</i></i>!</p><p> </p><p><strong>How will this help others?</strong></p><p>The easy answer is money:  20% of all profits go directly to the Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Medicine Unit of Seattle Children’s. Moreover, the long-term goal is to open a dialogue between the public, mental health professionals, and the families who live with this disease.</p><p>There was a time when blindness, autism, or Down syndrome was not brought up in general conversation, when those afflicted children were shunned or hidden or worse. Today, thankfully, the civilized world recognizes this as barbaric treatment. Childhood mental illness is no different. It is time to bring it to light.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why a ""funny fable""?</strong></p><p>Bringing laughter to a serious conversation not only lessens anxiety, it also reminds us of why we fight for each day, each moment, and every memory. Life is good.</p><p>Storytelling has been a lifelong dream. From the first time a tale was read to me, I wanted to write my own stories. There are books in my head; it's time to set them free.</p><p>My favorite part of this journey has been taking <i>The Other Mermaid</i> to hospitals and sharing it with the kids. Shifting their focus – even for a minute – from the seriousness of their illness and allowing them be silly for a while, this is joyful.</p><p>By openly declaring this purpose on the book’s cover, we believe a conversation is started. It is our greatest hope that this will be only the beginning.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What are our future plans?</strong></p><p><i>The Other Mermaid</i> is the first book in a series. I am already working on book two, <i>The Other Lily Pad</i>, and have begun the outline for book three, <i>The Other Slipper</i>. All will be a part of the bigger project connected to pediatric psychiatry.</p><p>My amazing son is now 22 years old, and on disability. This project gives him hope and purpose, as he contributes to our family by helping with the multimedia. He has a wicked sense of humor; some of the best punch lines are his.</p><p>An offshoot of this project has blossomed into workshops with interned children so they can write their own imaginative tales! This incredible process has become so much bigger than my story. It has become Everyone’s story. It has brought joy, hope and a fuller meaning to my life. And it is my sincerest desire to bring that joy and hope to others.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How can YOU get involved?</strong></p><p>Become part of this growing community! By sharing my story with others, you will encourage an open dialogue on childhood mental illness. By donating what you can, large or small, your generosity will ensure <i>The Other Mermaid</i> gets printed. Your money will promote the fall fundraiser at Seattle Children's, which in turn, will lay the groundwork for 'The Mermaid Guild', a non-profit launching at the hospital in the Spring of 2018.

By donating 20% of the sales to Seattle Children’s Psychiatry Unit we are shining a light on childhood mental illness, an issue too often kept secret and stigmatized.Our goal is to raise acceptance, to end the isolation families experience because of this tragic disease, and to bring laughter to those children marginalized by the seriousness of it Why pediatric psychiatry?Childhood mental illness has directly impacted my family; first with my brother, and now with my only child. In a period of four months, my son went from the top 10% of his freshman class to bedridden and suicidal. We were shocked and devastated by this downfall.I have seen, first-hand, how childhood mental illness consumes a family’s focus, how it isolates, how emotionally exhausting it is. Childhood mental illness causes an extra layer of conflict and tension, for it is easily dismissed by others – even from within the family – because the damage isn’t on the outside. It isn’t visible to the untrained eye, so that when a crisis erupts it is confusing and frightening. I've had friends abandon me due to the fear and stigmas still attached to the disease of mental illness.I am compelled to change the world. Other families are hurting, other children are left behind. Childhood mental illness is not contagious. It’s nobody’s fault. It has nothing to do with ethics or morals or being a good person. It is simply a disease, like any other.Volunteerism and philanthropy have been a part of my life since early childhood. I am deeply honored, humbled, and forever grateful to use the platform of The Other Mermaid for the greater good. Why now?I spent many years managing doctors, therapists, and endless crises. I supplemented part-time work with commission-based direct sales. I’d been in survival mode for so long that when asked what I did really well … well, I couldn’t remember. So, when a challenge arose from eWomenNetwork to do something uniquely me, I grabbed ahold of it like a lifeline.That was nearly 8 months ago. Miraculously, The Other Mermaid was just sent to the printers! How will this help others?The easy answer is money:  20% of all profits go directly to the Psychiatry & Behavioral Medicine Unit of Seattle Children’s. Moreover, the long-term goal is to open a dialogue between the public, mental health professionals, and the families who live with this disease.There was a time when blindness, autism, or Down syndrome was not brought up in general conversation, when those afflicted children were shunned or hidden or worse. Today, thankfully, the civilized world recognizes this as barbaric treatment. Childhood mental illness is no different. It is time to bring it to light. Why a ""funny fable""?Bringing laughter to a serious conversation not only lessens anxiety, it also reminds us of why we fight for each day, each moment, and every memory. Life is good.Storytelling has been a lifelong dream. From the first time a tale was read to me, I wanted to write my own stories. There are books in my head; it's time to set them free.My favorite part of this journey has been taking The Other Mermaid to hospitals and sharing it with the kids. Shifting their focus – even for a minute – from the seriousness of their illness and allowing them be silly for a while, this is joyful.By openly declaring this purpose on the book’s cover, we believe a conversation is started. It is our greatest hope that this will be only the beginning. What are our future plans?The Other Mermaid is the first book in a series. I am already working on book two, The Other Lily Pad, and have begun the outline for book three, The Other Slipper. All will be a part of the bigger project connected to pediatric psychiatry.My amazing son is now 22 years old, and on disability. This project gives him hope and purpose, as he contributes to our family by helping with the multimedia. He has a wicked sense of humor; some of the best punch lines are his.An offshoot of this project has blossomed into workshops with interned children so they can write their own imaginative tales! This incredible process has become so much bigger than my story. It has become Everyone’s story. It has brought joy, hope and a fuller meaning to my life. And it is my sincerest desire to bring that joy and hope to others. How can YOU get involved?Become part of this growing community! By sharing my story with others, you will encourage an open dialogue on childhood mental illness. By donating what you can, large or small, your generosity will ensure The Other Mermaid gets printed. Your money will promote the fall fundraiser at Seattle Children's, which in turn, will lay the groundwork for 'The Mermaid Guild', a non-profit launching at the hospital in the Spring of 2018. You are invited to help keep this conversation going; please, contact me directly if you would like to share your own story. I look forward to hearing from you.Share this Project!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>I'm best-known for my two books on the lowbrow / pop surrealist art movement: <strong>WEIRDO DELUXE</strong> (2005) and <strong>WEIRDO NOIR</strong> (2010). Both have done very well and gotten great reviews. I love the ""weirdo"" books and the lowbrow art movement. I feel that lowbrow / pop surrealist art liberates our imagination and thinking. I hope my books do that for us too. (For more about me and my books, here's a link to my author's page on Amazon: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Matt-Dukes-Jordan/e/B001K8B7R6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Matt-Dukes-Jordan/e/B001K8B7R6</a> )</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My current project — <strong>WEIRDO CARNIVAL WORLDWIDE</strong> (2013 - projected) — is intended to accomplish some things I haven't done in my previous two books on lowbrow / pop surrealist art. For one thing, I want to explore how lowbrow / pop surrealist art has become a worldwide phenomenon and why. I want to show how there are some local variations and place-specific cultural influences on the art, but also how there are underlying similarities worldwide. I'm also interested in highlighting the amazing draftsmanship of a lot of lowbrow artists — something I've done in a limited way in my other books, but want to do much more with this one. And — I'd like to explore in more depth the idea of the carnivalesque. The Russian critic Mikhail Bakhtin first wrote extensively about this, and his ideas seem to me to be a key to understanding the entire movement. Again, I've done this in my previous two books, but want to go further.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, overall, this book will have longer essays in it than in my past books. I feel that the lowbrow/pop surrealist movement has been written about mostly in one might call a ""journalistic"" way, and even my past books were, admittedly, designed primarily for a general audience. I'd like to explore ideas, history, and the scope and impact of this kind of art in more depth. This almost seems like the job for a tenured professor on a sabbatical, but I have no such backing. On the other hand, I have, perhaps, more freedom. I can write to satisfy myself and my ideal audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I also plan to make some short videos and perhaps eventually a feature-length documentary on the material I cover in the book. I attended the San Francisco Art Institute in filmmaking, but also studied art history at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and I have taken art classes at other colleges. I'd love to make a feature film someday, perhaps a film about lowbrow artists rushng around in custom cars on the streets of L.A. (Any takers? Note: I've written some screenplays, including one about some burlesque dancers and guys driving hot rods.) In the meantime, I've made some short films. You can see my short videos on youTube, Vimeo, and Funny or Die. One short video on Robert Williams is pretty popular. ( <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-XjcE4vd0I"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-XjcE4vd0I</a> ) Miami street art and Bukowski have been subjects, but I've also make videos about farting. Anything that makes me laugh makes me happy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Back to the subject of the writing of the book. There are many people who are writing about this art movement, but I feel that I'm well qualified for a number of reasons. I love humor and quirky, transgressive, subversive, indie-style art, whether a film by Jim Jarmusch featuring Steve Buscemi or a painting by Glenn Barr spoofing the Betty Rubble of the TV show ""The Flintstones."" Most humor is based on some kind of reversal of expectations, and that tends to make us think of alternatives and step outside of the predictable and ordinary — thus much humor is, to some extent, subversive or transgressive. I think that my love of humor is a significant part of why the whole lowbrow / pop surrealist art movement appeals to me so much. I also love cartoons, animation, and comics, and drawing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's a little more about my qualifications. I taught the first-ever class on lowbrow art history at the college level at Otis College of Art and Design in L.A. I've shown art in galleries in L.A., New Orleans, Miami, and Key West. I've published well over 1,000 articles and been a full-time staff journalist on a newspaper. My book about Charles Bukowski (a guy with a great sense of humor) called <strong>BUKOWSKI'S LA</strong> (2008) has been enjoyed by many Bukowski fans.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book I'm planning now will be bigger and, I hope, better than the ones I've done before. It's financially difficult to create a book like this on my own. I had help from friends and family with my last three books, and I had the support of a major publisher on the two WEIRDO books. Chronicle Books generously provided an advance which helped with my cost of living while I wrote the books and they did the design work and supplied an expert copy editor to edit the book — and a project editor to offer support with the overall process of creating the books. They gave me considerable creative freedom so the key elements of the books were what I had in mind. Yet the wonderful people at Chronicle created an environment of support and encouragement that was very helpful at every stage of the creation, publication, and promotion of those books.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Funding for <strong>WEIRDO CARNIVAL WORLDWIDE</strong> will help me with the book in the following areas:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Research — This involves a lot of legwork and if I had an assistant, that would be awesome. Perhaps I can employ a few people in different roles, even part time, on this book.</p>
<p>Writing — This takes time, but the right equipment helps too. My last laptop finally fell apart: some of the the keys literally broke off the keyboard and other features of the computer failed.</p>
<p>Production work — All work related to gathering materials (like photos) and formatting the book for publication is a considerable effort. </p>
<p>Design — I'd love to hire a designer, though I did, long ago, work in book publishing and designed some books. (But I know some book designers who could use some work and would do a great job.)</p>
<p>Publication support — This book will be a print-on-demand book just like BUKOWSKI'S LA, but there are costs involved in moving the book from manuscript to finished books.</p>
<p>Promotion support — Getting the word out is a big job! What a dream to imagine hiring even a part-time publicist! (Chronicle had great people on their staff for this.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Funding will help with the videos as well, and in the same areas (with the exception of ""publication""). Replacing outdated equipment would be a welcome luxury.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With more funds, I can be more ambitious and productive in all the areas listed!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope you find the idea of another cool ""weirdo"" book exciting. Your help is much appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><strong>PERKS</strong></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As for the perks, I'll thank everyone who contributes right in the book itself. I'll also be e-mailing everyone a newsletter every few months about progress on the book and videos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Books are great perks! At the 25-dollar level of support, I offer the option of picking one of my books (either <strong>WEIRDO DELUXE</strong> or <strong>WEIRDO CARNIVAL</strong> <strong>WORLDWIDE</strong>), or if you help a bit more, you get both!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you move up in helping out with this project, art is available as perks along with the books! My art is evolving. I have done literally thousands of fast sketches over the years. I've been painting on and off for many years. In 2001, I showed at the superb Lucky Street Gallery in Key West under the name of R. Mutt — wooden constructions of various kinds. I've show at Barrister's Gallery in New Orleans in a show of feminist art. I've been a regular at Hyaena Gallery in Los Angeles for years. I also showed at Monkey House Toys in Los Angeles. And I've had a couple of brief pop-up shows at Harold Golen Gallery in Miami when I was there to lecture on lowbrow / pop surrealism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So— my art is fun, funny, and somewhat ""outsider"" in nature. I will soon provide a link to my own art site, but for now you can see examples of my art on the Hyaena Gallery website, here:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.hyaenagallery.com/mattdukesjordansold.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hyaenagallery.com/mattdukesjordansold.html</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will be making new cool art as perks for this book! If you like the style of some of the work you see on the Hyaena site, I can work in that style. Lately, I've been doing more work on paper but also doing more blending and shading of figures. But as you can see, the heart of my art is drawing and cartooning!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A big way to help this book and video project is to share links to it and let people know about it!!</p>

<p>Hope to be in touch with you and be a partner in the book.</p></div>","I'm best-known for my two books on the lowbrow / pop surrealist art movement: WEIRDO DELUXE (2005) and WEIRDO NOIR (2010).

<p><b>Misty’s Fight</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>I
don’t think that Hollywood could have come up with a better story than that of
Misty and I.  As many of you know, I went
through a long, bitter divorce that was final in 2005.  Since then, I had relationships that all
failed in one way or another – most ended in train wrecks!  I had just about given up on finding a
relationship that would make me happy. 
Then Misty came into my life.<p></p><p>
</p><p>I’ve known Misty for over 10 years.  She had been a friend, and I never saw her as
more than that.  She had her share of
issues that she went through, and about three years ago, we decided to
date.  It was fantastic, as I saw that
she was an amazing woman, and she made me very happy.  However, between her three kids (ages 7-15),
my two (14 &amp; 18), my business, and all the things that life<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
throws in our paths, we never seemed to have any time for “us”.  We stopped trying, and drifted apart.  Then, back in late November 2012, she called
me to see what I was up to.  We started
talking and soon we were dating, as if no time had slipped by.  We “clicked” at once.  She made me feel very comfortable and happy,
without even trying.  All the cares of
the world slipped away when I was with her. </p><p>  I did not know I was going to marry her at the time, but I
knew she was special, and I knew I wanted her to be a part of my life, so in early March, I brought her to meet my parents.  While there, she started to have lower back
pain.  She called her doctor, who thought
it was kidney stones.  He prescribed some
medication that was supposed to dissolve them, but after a week, she was still
in intense pain.  He brought her in for
an examination, and instead of kidney stones, he found abnormal tissue.  A biopsy was done, and they started her on
interferon before the results even came back. 
She has Renal Cell Carcinoma, kidney cancer.<br/></p><p></p><p> This was the absolute worst time for this to happen.  Misty has no insurance, and my divorce, and
the subsequent economic downturn, left me with few assets – my building and
home are worth less than the mortgages (as with most of America).  I have a small CPA practice, and have always
believed in charging what I feel is a fair price, and I have always done
business with a handshake.  That has come
to sting me in this economy as well.  I
have had several clients close or go out of business owing me thousands of
dollars.  </p><p></p>
<p>The doctors were going to remove her cancerous kidney.  While she was in the
hospital for some pre-surgical testing, the doctors discovered
that her cancer had spread to her liver, and that she was Stage 4.  Her numbers were too high for the doctors to
remove her kidney.  Misty was immediately
started on an aggressive chemo and fusion program, with the goal of
encapsulating the kidney, and getting her levels low enough for them to remove
the kidney. </p><p>Soon after, my son, Misty and I went to Texas
Roadhouse, my son’s favorite restaurant, for dinner.  I had talked to my son first, and he was
excited.  As we were waiting for dinner,
I pulled out a ring and proposed to Misty. 
She was in total shock, but she said yes!  That alone made me the luckiest guy in the
world!  No one should go through a fight
like this alone, and I knew I loved Misty, and wanted to have her in my life
for as long as she had, which I prayed was 50 or more years!  We were married a few weeks later.</p><p></p>
<p>On Friday, June 7, 2013, the doctors told us that in spite
of the aggressive chemo, her levels were not dropping fast enough.  Misty had about two months left, unless she
went through some expensive treatments. 
Until you have been through it, you don’t know how it feels to hear that
your wife, the one that you love so much and makes you so happy, has such a
short time left.  It tore my heart right
out!  I told the doctor we would do the
shots.  The shots were very expensive
(almost $14,000 per round of four shots, she needed three rounds) and they were
extremely painful, and made her very sick. 
We came up with the funds, with the help of some family members.  She took the shots once a week, on Friday,
and was sick until the following Tuesday. 
She continued with the daily chemo and fusion treatments even through
the shots.  In the end, her levels
dropped significantly.  The shots were
well worth the cost!</p>
<p>Since the final shots, however, there has been one
complication after another that has delayed removing the cancerous kidney.  First, she had an infection that delayed it a
couple weeks.  Because of the daily
chemo, her immune system is almost destroyed, so <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>she
is very susceptible to infections and illnesses.  Then the ports in her abdomen (two tubes
through which they give her chemo) failed a couple times and had to be
replaced.  Then they got infected.</p>
<p>In early December, we got another scare.  Her neck started hurting, and she developed
two large bumps on the side of her neck. 
At a meeting with the doctor, he told us that the bumps were her lymph
glands, and they were inflamed.  He said
it was one of two reasons – either she was fighting an infection or virus, or
that the cancer had spread to her neck. 
Since cancer usually spreads from organ to organ, if the cancer had
spread from her kidney and liver all the way to her neck, she was probably full
of cancer, and there would not be much that they could do.  He prescribed some powerful antibiotics, and
gave her five days to see improvement before he biopsied the lymph glands.  The next day, Sunday, I was out with my son,
and she was visiting relatives, when I got a call from a number I did not
recognize.  It was my wife, calling from
a local hospital’s ER!  I flew out there,
and found her holding an ice pack to her neck. 
She handed me the clip board with the papers showing her diagnosis.  It said “Severe shingles”.  I yelled “Thank God!”  The doctor came in and said it was the first
time he had heard someone happy with a shingles diagnosis, as it was such a
painful disease.  I told him I was not
happy with what it was, I was grateful for what it wasn’t.  If it was shingles, that means it was not
cancer!</p><p></p>
<p>The shingles regime took many weeks to clear up, then her
port had an infection, which brings her to where we are now. Her levels have
been going up, which is not good.  Last
Tuesday, the doctor told her she needed another round of those very expensive
shot treatments.  She responded so well
to the first set, he feels that another round or two of them will bring her
levels back down to the point where they can remove her kidney.  She told the doctor we could not afford
another round of shots, what were her alternatives.  He said if we did not get the shots, they
would keep her comfortable for however long she has left, which he says is
about six months.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>I
am not ready to give up on her!  I love
her, she is my life!  She is young, she

<p>So I am asking your help! 
Please donate whatever you can!  I

<p></p></div>","Misty’s Fight
I
don’t think that Hollywood could have come up with a better story than that of
Misty and I.  As many of you know, I went
through a long, bitter divorce that was final in 2005.  Since then, I had relationships that all
failed in one way or another – most ended in train wrecks!  I had just about given up on finding a
relationship that would make me happy. 
Then Misty came into my life.
I’ve known Misty for over 10 years.  She had been a friend, and I never saw her as
more than that.  She had her share of
issues that she went through, and about three years ago, we decided to
date.  It was fantastic, as I saw that
she was an amazing woman, and she made me very happy.  However, between her three kids (ages 7-15),
my two (14 & 18), my business, and all the things that life
throws in our paths, we never seemed to have any time for “us”.  We stopped trying, and drifted apart.  Then, back in late November 2012, she called
me to see what I was up to.  We started
talking and soon we were dating, as if no time had slipped by.  We “clicked” at once.  She made me feel very comfortable and happy,
without even trying.  All the cares of
the world slipped away when I was with her.   I did not know I was going to marry her at the time, but I
knew she was special, and I knew I wanted her to be a part of my life, so in early March, I brought her to meet my parents.  While there, she started to have lower back
pain.  She called her doctor, who thought
it was kidney stones.  He prescribed some
medication that was supposed to dissolve them, but after a week, she was still
in intense pain.  He brought her in for
an examination, and instead of kidney stones, he found abnormal tissue.  A biopsy was done, and they started her on
interferon before the results even came back. 
She has Renal Cell Carcinoma, kidney cancer. This was the absolute worst time for this to happen.  Misty has no insurance, and my divorce, and
the subsequent economic downturn, left me with few assets – my building and
home are worth less than the mortgages (as with most of America).  I have a small CPA practice, and have always
believed in charging what I feel is a fair price, and I have always done
business with a handshake.  That has come
to sting me in this economy as well.  I
have had several clients close or go out of business owing me thousands of
dollars.  
The doctors were going to remove her cancerous kidney.  While she was in the
hospital for some pre-surgical testing, the doctors discovered
that her cancer had spread to her liver, and that she was Stage 4.  Her numbers were too high for the doctors to
remove her kidney.  Misty was immediately
started on an aggressive chemo and fusion program, with the goal of
encapsulating the kidney, and getting her levels low enough for them to remove
the kidney. Soon after, my son, Misty and I went to Texas
Roadhouse, my son’s favorite restaurant, for dinner.  I had talked to my son first, and he was
excited.  As we were waiting for dinner,
I pulled out a ring and proposed to Misty. 
She was in total shock, but she said yes!  That alone made me the luckiest guy in the

<div>Underdog Revolution is advocacy for underdogs and underserved communities around the world. It’s also a call for large aid organizations and decision-makers to redefine innovation and social change. It argues for a world where underdogs and underserved communities are not seen as a burden, rather an untapped opportunity. In writing this book, I aim to invite the world to see us (the poor), the (undeserved) as co-creators, co-researchers, co-leaders, and not as data providers nor as a laboratory only for scientific study on poverty. Underdog Revolution is filled with examples and stories of local innovators who are moving the human race forward in the dark. My book will publish in April of 2020, just before my 31st birthday, so as it’s in my ""bucket list"", I will be a Published published Author at 30. :-)</div>

<p><i>This is just a Mockup, you will help me choose my real book cover</i></p>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><br/>Underdog Revolution is a new lens through which we can see poverty, innovation, and social change if we want to empower the 3.5 billion people living at the bottom of the pyramid.</p>
<p>My name is Pierre Stanley Baptiste and I am the author of ""<strong>Underdog Revolution</strong>"".</p>
<p>I hope in reading this book, you will discover how to empower underdogs in your immediate circle and unleash innovation at the bottom of the pyramid. Much like in the story of David and Goliath. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the non-obvious winners (the David's of the world who can beat Goliath ) in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you recognize your underdogs' bias, do better charity work, a guide to discover tools and ways to enact social change that put the human at the center of the change you want to make, and overall how to apply underdog revolution in schools, churches, entrepreneurship and in your own life.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about the link between creativity and scarcity, the reason why the top-down approach to innovation is wrong and discover how and why we need a new type of innovation if we want the 3.5 billion people living at the base of the pyramid (BOP) to thrive.</p>
<p>Did you know there are specific circumstances in which we support underdogs and most of them have little to do with the underdogs? Through the underdog revolution, you will learn the psychological reasons, bias, and fallacies that push us to support the underdog.</p>
<p>Based on my experiences working with underdogs and underserved communities in Haiti for the past 9 years, I offer you some practical ideas on how to even the playing field to allow underserved communities to thrive. Did you know Haiti doesn’t have access to Paypal and Stripe?</p>
<p>You will learn about the story of a man who spends two decades of his life cutting a path through a mountain. Stories of amazing leaders/changemakers such as Guerrier Hovard, Louino Robillard, Daniel Tilias, Katherine Hoke, Daquan Olivier, Nzingah Oniwosan and many more will inspire you and teach you about willpower, effort, the value of mentoring, giving back and the power of seeing what others cannot see.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in transforming lives at the bottom of the pyramid, if you want to see underserved communities and underdogs in a new light and if you actively looking for new ways to engage the people you seek to serve.</p>
<p>Underdog Revolution is a non-fiction book that speaks to international aid agencies’ experts, community leaders and any individuals who are interested in poverty alleviation, social change, innovation and who want to empower those who are seemed at a disadvantage.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Underdog Innovation</h3>
<p>This book follows the three-act structure as in the War Of Art of Steven Pressfield. Each part brings you on this different adventure while staying consistent with the general theme.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br/>How does the first black nation in the world become the poorest country in the western hemisphere? Section 1 starts with a story dear to my heart and that most convey the revolution carried by underdogs.</p>
<p>I also map out the advantages and challenges of the bottom of the pyramid, tackle the limitations of the top-down innovation approach and the value of creative constraints using scientific evidence and my personal story on how I manage to open Impact Hub Port-au-Prince with only 20% of the budget, without employees and with all the challenges that came with it. You will also learn about some new concepts such as ""toolbox fallacy: and the ""savior complex"".</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br/>How what was once a gang-infested neighborhood is creating change for a whole country and region? Part two dives into this great social change started at a community level and is carried by underdogs. You will also learn about some new ways to drive innovation, do research and create companies take the human element into account. You will learn about the power of second chance through an organization that’s empowering ex-criminals to become an entrepreneur and how some of them are thriving. I share personal ideas on how to turn ghettos into innovation lab and different types of labs we could set up in underserved communities to bring forth local innovation. The underdog advantage, the 7 strengths of an underdog.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Part 3</strong><br/>In part 3 I talk about the path forward and how we can build a better world through the bottom-up innovation approach. The steps (based on my experiences and research) to unleash innovation at the bottom of the pyramid and to replicate stories of creative-problem-solving, like the boy who harnessed the wind whom I met in 2014. You learn about scientific evidence about the correlation between GDP growth and inequality. You will also learn how the balance of these 3 elements environment, resource and pressure can make or break an underdog. Sprinkled with more than a dozen inspiring stories of individuals and organizations, part 3 paints the way forward on how to replicate underdog revolution in different types of organizations and how I envision a future when underserved communities and underdogs are empowered to solve their problems and to inspire more people to create change.</p>

<h3>More about me</h3>
<p>It all started on the Sunday of June 7, 1998, when I read a passage of the bible for my first communion day celebration. They had to put two bricks under my feet so people could see my face reading. This moment became a determining factor in my life. I was 8 years old.</p>
<p>After I finished reading, something strange happened; the church gave me a standing ovation. At that very moment, something in me was born and I knew I had a special gift to share with the world. Since that Sunday, I never stopped on my quest to become a better human being and to improve my surroundings.</p>
<p>This passion for bettering myself and people around me led to teaching, creative writing, blogging, podcasting, social entrepreneurship, personal development, philosophy, technology, event designing, and youth empowerment.</p>
<p>In 2014 I launched my personal blog pierrestanleybaptiste.com to share 20% of information that can have the highest impact on someone’s life. My contents were in English, but In 2016 I felt the urge to communicate with my community. So, I started writing in Haitian Creole for the very first time. People who speak creole in a professional setting are seen as non-educated while it’s the language of the majority. As of today, I have published over 100 blog posts on productivity, cognitive biases, learning techniques, branding, tech and other topics around professional development. My blog has become a reference and learning platform for dozens of young Haitians looking to better themselves.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>My love for writing led me to write for the HuffingtonPost (English is my 3rd language), Pursuit and self-published my books. In December 2016, I published REVEY (ebook) to help people wake the genie up and discover the work they were born to do. In 2017, my second ebook KALIFYE came out. Kalifye introduces young people to 107 free digital tools they can use to create, learn and find a better for their smartphones and computers. This book is a direct response to the telecommunication companies in Haiti promoting the internet as a tool for social media use only. In this book, I opened readers' eyes to the endless possibilities the internet offers.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AClPyWrC7y0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>I desperately want to leave a legacy of helping the weakest ones thrive whether it means raising money to help 200 farmers after Hurricane Matthew, providing school supplies to over 2000 students as well as developing an entrepreneurship education program for disadvantaged high school students.</p>
<p>In 2016 after a hard break up and a depression, I purchased a one-way ticket to go to the USA and to never come back to Haiti. Little did I know, this trip would lead to the biggest project I have undertaken in my entire life. After spending 3 months in the US, I decided to come back to launch Impact Hub Port-au-Prince, the first local hub and co-working space in Haiti with a global imprint.</p>
<p>As part of our programs, we recently hosted the 4th edition of StartupWeek, the largest and most inclusive entrepreneurial event in Port-au-Prince, welcoming more than 1500 attendees, 65 speakers, and 50 volunteers. Our space has become a community where coders, leaders, creators, designers meet, network and create amazing ventures with the aim to make a social impact.</p>
<p>Now, I am working on the first Haitian Creole media platform for entrepreneurs, a co-creating space to creative professionals, and this book which has been in my mind for 7 years. My larger vision can be summarized in three simple words “Empowering Non-obvious Winners”. I hope to be able to live to that aspiration. </p>

Underdog Revolution is filled with examples and stories of local innovators who are moving the human race forward in the dark. My book will publish in April of 2020, just before my 31st birthday, so as it’s in my ""bucket list"", I will be a Published published Author at 30. :-)
 

This is just a Mockup, you will help me choose my real book cover
Story of My Book
Underdog Revolution is a new lens through which we can see poverty, innovation, and social change if we want to empower the 3.5 billion people living at the bottom of the pyramid.
My name is Pierre Stanley Baptiste and I am the author of ""Underdog Revolution"".
I hope in reading this book, you will discover how to empower underdogs in your immediate circle and unleash innovation at the bottom of the pyramid. Much like in the story of David and Goliath. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the non-obvious winners (the David's of the world who can beat Goliath ) in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you recognize your underdogs' bias, do better charity work, a guide to discover tools and ways to enact social change that put the human at the center of the change you want to make, and overall how to apply underdog revolution in schools, churches, entrepreneurship and in your own life.
In this book, you'll learn about the link between creativity and scarcity, the reason why the top-down approach to innovation is wrong and discover how and why we need a new type of innovation if we want the 3.5 billion people living at the base of the pyramid (BOP) to thrive.
Did you know there are specific circumstances in which we support underdogs and most of them have little to do with the underdogs? Through the underdog revolution, you will learn the psychological reasons, bias, and fallacies that push us to support the underdog.
Based on my experiences working with underdogs and underserved communities in Haiti for the past 9 years, I offer you some practical ideas on how to even the playing field to allow underserved communities to thrive. Did you know Haiti doesn’t have access to Paypal and Stripe?
You will learn about the story of a man who spends two decades of his life cutting a path through a mountain. Stories of amazing leaders/changemakers such as Guerrier Hovard, Louino Robillard, Daniel Tilias, Katherine Hoke, Daquan Olivier, Nzingah Oniwosan and many more will inspire you and teach you about willpower, effort, the value of mentoring, giving back and the power of seeing what others cannot see.
You will love this book if you are interested in transforming lives at the bottom of the pyramid, if you want to see underserved communities and underdogs in a new light and if you actively looking for new ways to engage the people you seek to serve.
Underdog Revolution is a non-fiction book that speaks to international aid agencies’ experts, community leaders and any individuals who are interested in poverty alleviation, social change, innovation and who want to empower those who are seemed at a disadvantage.
 
The Book - Underdog Innovation
This book follows the three-act structure as in the War Of Art of Steven Pressfield. Each part brings you on this different adventure while staying consistent with the general theme.
Part 1How does the first black nation in the world become the poorest country in the western hemisphere? Section 1 starts with a story dear to my heart and that most convey the revolution carried by underdogs.
I also map out the advantages and challenges of the bottom of the pyramid, tackle the limitations of the top-down innovation approach and the value of creative constraints using scientific evidence and my personal story on how I manage to open Impact Hub Port-au-Prince with only 20% of the budget, without employees and with all the challenges that came with it. You will also learn about some new concepts such as ""toolbox fallacy: and the ""savior complex"".
Part 2How what was once a gang-infested neighborhood is creating change for a whole country and region? Part two dives into this great social change started at a community level and is carried by underdogs. You will also learn about some new ways to drive innovation, do research and create companies take the human element into account. You will learn about the power of second chance through an organization that’s empowering ex-criminals to become an entrepreneur and how some of them are thriving. I share personal ideas on how to turn ghettos into innovation lab and different types of labs we could set up in underserved communities to bring forth local innovation. The underdog advantage, the 7 strengths of an underdog.
Part 3In part 3 I talk about the path forward and how we can build a better world through the bottom-up innovation approach. The steps (based on my experiences and research) to unleash innovation at the bottom of the pyramid and to replicate stories of creative-problem-solving, like the boy who harnessed the wind whom I met in 2014. You learn about scientific evidence about the correlation between GDP growth and inequality. You will also learn how the balance of these 3 elements environment, resource and pressure can make or break an underdog. Sprinkled with more than a dozen inspiring stories of individuals and organizations, part 3 paints the way forward on how to replicate underdog revolution in different types of organizations and how I envision a future when underserved communities and underdogs are empowered to solve their problems and to inspire more people to create change.

About the Author
StartingBloc fellow and Honorary Citizen of Wausau, Pierre Stanley Baptiste dances at the crossroads of unrealistic aspirations, creativity, and social impact. Pierre has a breadth of experience in public speaking, social entrepreneurship, and social media. He also has a not-so-secret love affair with writing, coffee, cooking, hiking, and red wine.
He was named among the 10 Haitians (Social Influencers) to follow on the web and also received the Haiti Numerique Youth Technology Leadership Award of Excellence in 2017. Pierre is currently the co-founder & managing director of Impact Hub Port-au-Prince, a local hub with a global community of more than 16,000 members.
From cooking meager meals over fires made with pine cones in Haiti to studying business in the U.S, Pierre now teaches the art of leveraging scarcity in Creole and English at www.pierrestanleybaptiste.com and speaks about his experiences including recent engagements at universities. As a Clinton Global Initiative University Fellow, Pierre founded Impact Ayiti, an initiative that teaches entrepreneurship to disadvantaged high school students in Haiti and has received a Volunteer Award from President Obama for his volunteer work in the United States.

More about me
It all started on the Sunday of June 7, 1998, when I read a passage of the bible for my first communion day celebration. They had to put two bricks under my feet so people could see my face reading. This moment became a determining factor in my life. I was 8 years old.
After I finished reading, something strange happened; the church gave me a standing ovation. At that very moment, something in me was born and I knew I had a special gift to share with the world. Since that Sunday, I never stopped on my quest to become a better human being and to improve my surroundings.
This passion for bettering myself and people around me led to teaching, creative writing, blogging, podcasting, social entrepreneurship, personal development, philosophy, technology, event designing, and youth empowerment.
In 2014 I launched my personal blog pierrestanleybaptiste.com to share 20% of information that can have the highest impact on someone’s life. My contents were in English, but In 2016 I felt the urge to communicate with my community. So, I started writing in Haitian Creole for the very first time. People who speak creole in a professional setting are seen as non-educated while it’s the language of the majority. As of today, I have published over 100 blog posts on productivity, cognitive biases, learning techniques, branding, tech and other topics around professional development. My blog has become a reference and learning platform for dozens of young Haitians looking to better themselves.
 
My love for writing led me to write for the HuffingtonPost (English is my 3rd language), Pursuit and self-published my books. In December 2016, I published REVEY (ebook) to help people wake the genie up and discover the work they were born to do. In 2017, my second ebook KALIFYE came out. Kalifye introduces young people to 107 free digital tools they can use to create, learn and find a better for their smartphones and computers. This book is a direct response to the telecommunication companies in Haiti promoting the internet as a tool for social media use only. In this book, I opened readers' eyes to the endless possibilities the internet offers.

I desperately want to leave a legacy of helping the weakest ones thrive whether it means raising money to help 200 farmers after Hurricane Matthew, providing school supplies to over 2000 students as well as developing an entrepreneurship education program for disadvantaged high school students.
In 2016 after a hard break up and a depression, I purchased a one-way ticket to go to the USA and to never come back to Haiti. Little did I know, this trip would lead to the biggest project I have undertaken in my entire life. After spending 3 months in the US, I decided to come back to launch Impact Hub Port-au-Prince, the first local hub and co-working space in Haiti with a global imprint.
As part of our programs, we recently hosted the 4th edition of StartupWeek, the largest and most inclusive entrepreneurial event in Port-au-Prince, welcoming more than 1500 attendees, 65 speakers, and 50 volunteers. Our space has become a community where coders, leaders, creators, designers meet, network and create amazing ventures with the aim to make a social impact.
Now, I am working on the first Haitian Creole media platform for entrepreneurs, a co-creating space to creative professionals, and this book which has been in my mind for 7 years. My larger vision can be summarized in three simple words “Empowering Non-obvious Winners”. I hope to be able to live to that aspiration.

</p><p>Hi, we’re
sharing details about an enthralling new book by author Larry Alexander.
Larry’s narrative shares the passion of a heart-wrenching, real-life missed
romantic encounter; in his experience, a genuine and incredible love at first
site episode. </p>
<p>This is why Larry is seeking your
financial support and your good wishes to help publish his new work, and yes,
Larry is seeking your help in finding his lost Princess.  She is the muse
who stirred this beautiful project. The
sub title of Larry’s book, “<i><u>Can You Help Me Find Her?</u></i>” is a
genuine, almost fairytale like, plea for crowdsourced help in locating his long
lost princess.</p>
<p>The script shares the story of an astonishing
love at first sight episode, an event that ultimately unfolded as a missed
romantic encounter. The work will no doubt capture the hearts, the minds, and
the imagination of every soul who’s ever wished for or experienced a true love
encounter.</p>
<p>The
effortless but captivating read documents the incredible phenomenon with the
voice of an, “I lived this event,” authority, and follows with the exact same
sentiment in possibly the most passionate and compelling seven-to-nine line
poetry ever composed for a missed romantic encounter.</p>
<p>The
transition from prose to poetry is seamless but is awaited with anticipation.
Few will read the pages of this unique story or drink in the contemporary heart
drops (the matchless poetry) contained therein and not reciprocate gratitude
with tears.</p>
<p>Join Larry in
this earnest, heart warming, thirty-five year old search for his mystical
princess. Help him overcome the anxiety of isolation; help him quench his many
sweet and ardent hopes, his darling dreams, and his heartfelt wishes. Help him
find a positive end and closure for both he and his princess.</p>
<p>The book
launch will feature a strategy never before attempted in the field of
publishing; a real time, live, internet search game and a world wide Hash Tag
campaign designed to find his princess. </p>
<p>The marvelous
and magical event portrayed in this spellbinding book occurred at the Texas
Renaissance Festival, located in Todd Mission, Texas. The Texas Renaissance
Festival is co-marketing this publication and the book launch. The book signing
will take place at the faire on opening day, October 11, 2014, during the 40<sup>th</sup>
anniversary celebration of the festival. </p>
<p><i><u>Sixty
Ways to Lament, Cherish and Glorify a Lost Princess,</u></i><i> <u>Can You Help Me
Find Her? </u></i>is of
coffee table quality. The book measures approximately 8 1/2” by 14”, has just
over one hundred pages and features an attractive full color Olde English
themed hard cover.</p>
<p>Please
support this deserving campaign with a generous financial investment and by
sharing awareness among your family members and friends.</p>
<br/><div>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Missed romantic connections occur every day
at the Texas Renaissance Festival. The romantic and magical ambience here “The
Kingdom” lends itself to numinous flights of the imagination and opens one’s
being up to enchanting possibilities.</p>
<p>But I was astonished when I learned of the Sixty Ways,
Princess encounter, and the authors thirty-five search to reconnect with the
girl of his dreams.</p>
<p>Never before has a story been told with
such passion and sincerity. Larry’s honesty in sharing a deeply personal experience
is incredible. Interspersed among his delights and his expectations, raw
emotion reveals his pain and lamentation.</p>
<p>The chronicle is heartwarming and
heartbreaking. It’s the kind of story that invades your being, absorbs your
psyche, touches your very soul, and becomes your own personal experience.</p>
<p>Live this uncanny, but breathtaking event
with Larry as he narrates his precious recall in candid prose and poignant
poetic verses.</p>

</div></div>","Hi, we’re
sharing details about an enthralling new book by author Larry Alexander.
Larry’s narrative shares the passion of a heart-wrenching, real-life missed
romantic encounter; in his experience, a genuine and incredible love at first
site episode. 
This is why Larry is seeking your
financial support and your good wishes to help publish his new work, and yes,
Larry is seeking your help in finding his lost Princess.  She is the muse
who stirred this beautiful project. The
sub title of Larry’s book, “Can You Help Me Find Her?” is a
genuine, almost fairytale like, plea for crowdsourced help in locating his long
lost princess.
The script shares the story of an astonishing
love at first sight episode, an event that ultimately unfolded as a missed
romantic encounter. The work will no doubt capture the hearts, the minds, and
the imagination of every soul who’s ever wished for or experienced a true love
encounter.
The
effortless but captivating read documents the incredible phenomenon with the
voice of an, “I lived this event,” authority, and follows with the exact same
sentiment in possibly the most passionate and compelling seven-to-nine line
poetry ever composed for a missed romantic encounter.
The
transition from prose to poetry is seamless but is awaited with anticipation.
Few will read the pages of this unique story or drink in the contemporary heart
drops (the matchless poetry) contained therein and not reciprocate gratitude
with tears.
Join Larry in
this earnest, heart warming, thirty-five year old search for his mystical
princess. Help him overcome the anxiety of isolation; help him quench his many
sweet and ardent hopes, his darling dreams, and his heartfelt wishes. Help him
find a positive end and closure for both he and his princess.
The book
launch will feature a strategy never before attempted in the field of
publishing; a real time, live, internet search game and a world wide Hash Tag
campaign designed to find his princess. 
The marvelous
and magical event portrayed in this spellbinding book occurred at the Texas
Renaissance Festival, located in Todd Mission, Texas. The Texas Renaissance
Festival is co-marketing this publication and the book launch. The book signing
will take place at the faire on opening day, October 11, 2014, during the 40th
anniversary celebration of the festival. 
Sixty
Ways to Lament, Cherish and Glorify a Lost Princess, Can You Help Me
Find Her? is of
coffee table quality. The book measures approximately 8 1/2” by 14”, has just
over one hundred pages and features an attractive full color Olde English
themed hard cover.
Please
support this deserving campaign with a generous financial investment and by
sharing awareness among your family members and friends.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Missed romantic connections occur every day
at the Texas Renaissance Festival. The romantic and magical ambience here “The
Kingdom” lends itself to numinous flights of the imagination and opens one’s
being up to enchanting possibilities.
But I was astonished when I learned of the Sixty Ways,
Princess encounter, and the authors thirty-five search to reconnect with the
girl of his dreams.
Never before has a story been told with
such passion and sincerity. Larry’s honesty in sharing a deeply personal experience
is incredible. Interspersed among his delights and his expectations, raw
emotion reveals his pain and lamentation.
The chronicle is heartwarming and
heartbreaking. It’s the kind of story that invades your being, absorbs your
psyche, touches your very soul, and becomes your own personal experience.
Live this uncanny, but breathtaking event
with Larry as he narrates his precious recall in candid prose and poignant
poetic verses.

<h3>Story of my Book</h3>
<p><u><i>Unlocking Unicorns</i></u> is a book about the stories, habits, and lessons of billion-dollar startup founders in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. While many individuals can recite the founding legends of Steve Jobs at Apple, Bill Gates at Microsoft, or Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook, only a handful can re-tell the stories of similarly successful non-Western founders. This book is a solution. It features translated stories derived from interviews with the founders of unicorn companies in emerging economies.<br/><br/>My name is Michael Bervell, and I am the author of Unlocking Unicorns. I am also an online blogger about innovation, entrepreneurship, and ideas. Every day for the last 500 days I have written one new startup idea on my blog, <a href=""http://BillionDollarStartupIdeas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BillionDollarStartupIdeas.com</a>. In just over a year I have reached more than 55,000 readers and 1,300 newsletter subscribers in more than 175 countries. Writing this global blog has taught me that while ideas are valuable, execution is everything.<br/><br/><i>Unlocking Unicorns</i> is the key to unlocking execution in emerging economies. I wrote this book because I believe that building the billion-dollar companies of the future will require an intimate understanding of both emerging economies and local jurisdictions.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the mental models and characteristics that enabled founders in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East to overcome and adapt to brain drain, leapfrogging technologies, location-based discrimination, and government unrest. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for diversity in entrepreneurship. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as the key to help you Unlock Unicorns in the developing world.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how the Internet and digital ecosystem is revolutionizing non-Western corporations. You'll hear stories translated from Chinese, Korean, Hindi, and Igbo and learn...</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophies such as “Guanxi” and mental models such as the ""Regret Minimization Framework"" that successful entrepreneurs have used to thrive while building unicorn companies in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.</li>
<li>How Jack Ma (founder of AliBaba), Bang Si-Hyuk (producer behind BTS), Cher Wang (founder of HTC), Mitchell Elegbe (founder of Africa’s first billion-dollar FinTech company) found the ideas behind their billion-dollar enterprises.</li>
<li>A framework for thinking about how to go from aimlessly testing out business ideas to refining to the right idea to finally executing on that idea to achieve business success.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you (1) Aspire to be a c-suite executive or founder of a global business anytime in the next 50 years, (2) Are an entrepreneurship junkie who loves creating or consuming content about startups and businesses, or (3) Want to learn more about the ecosystem of creativity in emerging economies around the world.<br/><br/><i>Unlocking Unicorns</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to aspiring founders and emerging economy investors who want to look at doing business during the international, interconnected 21st century in a new way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book -- <i>Unlocking Unicorns</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts...<br/><br/><strong>Part 1, Exploration </strong>contains the <strong>Introduction + Chapters 2-4</strong>. This section sets out to answer the question: how do entrepreneurs find the ideas that create a billion-dollar corporation? While all founders must embark on similar journeys to expand their world views before creating companies, the three founders you’ll read about in Part 1 are exceptional embodiments of exploration. They started by either intentionally or unintentionally exploring the world around them and, even as unicorn company CEOs, continue to use their unique skills to succeed. The three founders are Jack Ma (Alibaba), Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw (Biocon), and Mitchell Elegbe (Interswitch).<br/><br/><strong>Part 2, Refinement</strong> contains <strong>Chapters 5-7</strong>. While unicorn companies may operate in a variety of fields, they all reveal a core kernel of truth when all the bells and whistles are stripped away. How should entrepreneurs build the heart of their business to sustain hyper-scaled growth? The three founders that you’ll read about in Part 2 distilled their complex explorations into focused efforts that develop mission-driven businesses. While the business world has infinite possibilities, Mudassir Sheikha (Careem), Cher Wang (HTC), and Robin Li (Baidu) refined their visions to effectively pull along a team and create an impact.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3, Execution</strong> contains <strong>Chapters 8-10 + the conclusion</strong>. So, then, what are the specific skills that a founder needs to build a unicorn? How does one scale from a profitable enterprise to a billion-dollar cash cow? The three founders you’ll read about in Part 3 realized that even after selecting an idea and refining it, success is a direct result of executing on a clear strategy. The strategies that Ritesh Agarwal (OYO), Hooi Ling Tan (Grab), and Bang Si-Hyuk (BTS) used to grow were immensely successful because they not only refined into a focus area, but also execute relentlessly.</p>

<li>During three years of research and two years of editing, conducted mainly in Romania, France, and Poland, I explored the history of European Yiddish theatre. While this theatre tradition is rather young at less than 150 years old, it is extraordinarily rich and diverse, spanning both sides of the Atlantic.My book is about the contemporary Yiddish theatre in Europe on historical background and was supposed to be published in July 2014 but the Polish Government gave me only half of the grant, this is simply not enough.</li>
<li>My publisher, Professor Janusz Degler from The University of Wroclaw, wants me to find remaining $3000 and I have until January 24 to raise the money in order to start the publishing process right away. Otherwise the Polish Government won't support the project and I won't be able to publish my book, which I've spent five years working on.</li>

<li>If you donate $10, I'll teach you a Yiddish curse word that you'll NEVER FORGET!</li>

</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My aim was to see
if Yiddish-language theatre is still visible in Europe beyond the deep depths
of archives. Furthermore, I wanted to find out if the current state of Yiddish theatre
in Europe could be said to be genuine or if, perhaps, it was just virtual. The
project is above all aimed at answering the question of whether or not it
makes any sense to have an active Yiddish theatre today. I also explore other issues relating to the role of contemporary Yiddish theatre in
modern Europe and its potential future. </p>
<p>During my research, I had an opportunity to get familiar with
several generations of Yiddish theatre artists, both through archival research,
as well as through interviews with contemporary actors, poets, and directors. The
people I interviewed seemed very touched by being able
to speak in Yiddish about Yiddish theatre with a young person. My journey was highly emotional and fruitful. The topic may not be very
popular, but without doubt it is worth exploring. </p>
<p>In my book, I focused
on the works of the theatres which still perform in Yiddish (for example: Jewish
State Theatre of Bucharest, Jewish State Theatre of Warsaw, LufTheatre in
Strasbourg, and Troïm Theatre in Paris). I analyzed their work carefully and I
came to the conclusion, that Yiddish theatre as a form of art might have some chance
of future development, although, because of its “virtual” shape, it will be completely
different that before March 1986. It will also remain, most likely, a part of
off-off culture and never reach the main stream theatre. </p>

off-off culture and never reach the main stream theatre.

among the redwoods, rays of sunshine coming out of the ground like swords,
glimmering, the doe looks at her fawn and hopes her buck is soon to appear. He
had gone down to the pool over the ridge to stand at the water’s edge and take

forest was a good place to live and play. Here, all creatures lived in harmony.</p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>Banish the Darkness is a young adult fantasy novel that centers on three humans that must save two worlds, including their own, from the control of a cruel King. Along the way, they learn of their own strengths and weaknesses, and must come to terms with the fact that nothing will be the same again.<br/><br/>My name is Ollie Monteleone and I am the author of Banish the Darkness. I wrote this book because I’ve always wanted to be an author, and since I dreamt up this idea in 2017, I knew I wanted to share it with the world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to step outside reality and explore the worlds I’ve created, and the characters that inhabit them. I want you to see this book as a chance to witness the choices each character makes, and observe how it impacts the plot as well as their own arcs, unable to escape from the consequences of their actions. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy young adult fantasy novels with well-developed characters, if you enjoy complicated plot lines, and if you enjoy deep, and often morally grey villains. <br/><br/>Banish the Darkness speaks to fantasy lovers and allies and members of the LGTBQ+ community who want to grapple with family and evil in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Banish the Darkness inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>How can I help others while remaining true to myself?</p>
<p>How important are blood family and chosen family in people’s lives?</p>
<p>How can we better ourselves by normalizing those different from us? </p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing chosen family vs blood family, being true to yourself, embracing your differences, and always fighting for the betterment of ourselves and others will change us all for the better. <br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book.

</div></div>","Story of My BookBanish the Darkness is a young adult fantasy novel that centers on three humans that must save two worlds, including their own, from the control of a cruel King. Along the way, they learn of their own strengths and weaknesses, and must come to terms with the fact that nothing will be the same again.My name is Ollie Monteleone and I am the author of Banish the Darkness. I wrote this book because I’ve always wanted to be an author, and since I dreamt up this idea in 2017, I knew I wanted to share it with the world.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to step outside reality and explore the worlds I’ve created, and the characters that inhabit them. I want you to see this book as a chance to witness the choices each character makes, and observe how it impacts the plot as well as their own arcs, unable to escape from the consequences of their actions. You will love this book if you enjoy young adult fantasy novels with well-developed characters, if you enjoy complicated plot lines, and if you enjoy deep, and often morally grey villains. Banish the Darkness speaks to fantasy lovers and allies and members of the LGTBQ+ community who want to grapple with family and evil in a new way.Ultimately, I hope that Banish the Darkness inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:How can I help others while remaining true to myself?
How important are blood family and chosen family in people’s lives?
How can we better ourselves by normalizing those different from us? I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing chosen family vs blood family, being true to yourself, embracing your differences, and always fighting for the betterment of ourselves and others will change us all for the better.  What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.
The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.

He lives a carefree transient life where the only thing that matters is the next woman, the next conquest, the next thrill.  The Hunger is the price he pays, the curse that demands he make a human kill every three moons or risk madness.  Yet he considers the cost worth the rewards of ultimate power and freedom.  Kain has everything he could want—until fate brings him to her...</i></p><p><i>Autumn Sullivan has the perfect life. She lives in the most beautiful place in the world, a cottage nestled in the sanctuary of an ancient redwood forest.  She has realized her dream of owning a beautiful little coffee shop in the quiet Northern California town where she grew up, and her life is free from the complications of men and relationships.

<div> </div>
<div>The funds received from the project will go to furthering my education and help complete <strong>The Eight-Moon Night</strong>.</div>

<h3>The Book Itself</h3>
""The Eight-Moon Night, Colten Dom's anticipated novel, tells the story of an ageless battle waged by Humanity at various points in Time; of Death itself, the force that waits hungrily at the end of each life; and of the fall of society as hysteria shakes the Modern Earth. The theme is one of futility and omnipresence, as the heroes of Man fight something that cannot be destroyed- mortality itself.""</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Throughout the book, I explore people's personalities and relationships with one another in the face of looming danger, and how heightened circumstances of passion and action at times accentuate the inherent nature of an individual. As the world around him changes, the protagonist Bill Carrawind is forced into a game of love and hate, happiness and misery as the Earth falls apart around him. The book is also designed to investigate the multi-layered wants, needs and emotions of a human, and how factions are formed and torn down as people aid and destroy one another; all in the face of a seemingly inescapable demise, which truly leads the reader to question, and later, to find the answer to why we live at all.</div>

Short Summary
I am Colten Dom, a seventeen year old living in Vancouver, B.C., and my dream is a career in literature, philosophy and writing. I have been accepted into the University of Victoria's renowned Writing Program; however, the fees of living on my own and actually attending university are very costly.
Writing has always been a great passion of mine, and in light of my recent accolades (I was awarded the Grade 12 English Scholarship at my school, as well as exhilaratingly high grades in Literature and AP English), I now possess the confidence to write a book!
 
The funds received from the project will go to furthering my education and help complete The Eight-Moon Night.

<p> Our campaign aims to have a vote to decriminalize marijuana in British Columbia.  We've written a law, called the Sensible Policing Act, which uses provincial jurisdiction over policing to stop all searches and arrests for marijuana possession in BC, as the first step towards full legalization.  Now we're collecting the signatures we need to put this law to a public vote.</p>
<p>I'm Dana Larsen, founder of the Sensible BC campaign. I have devoted my life to marijuana law reform. I served as editor of Cannabis Culture Magazine for ten years, working closely with publisher Marc Emery, who has been serving a five year sentence in Yazoo, Mississippi.</p>
<p><span>This campaign puts decriminalization within reach of British Columbians.</span></p>
<p>We have thousands of volunteers all over the province that are working hard to make decriminalization a reality. From Quesnel to Cranbrook, Prince Rupert to Sooke, our dedicated signature collectors are doing the work to make this happen, conversation by conversation, signature by signature.</p>But we need your help. Our volunteers are busily out in their community getting the job done, but they need the printing, signage, buttons and campaign materials to get it done.<p></p>
<p>Canada is ripe for marijuana law reform, but we need a trigger to make change actually happen. Like many parts of the world, the Canadian people are ahead of their politicians on this issue. This is why we need to put this to a referendum.</p>
<p>BC is the only Canadian province with a referendum system. But it's difficult to get on the ballot here. We have 90 days to collect about half a million signatures from all across the province to qualify for a public vote on this issue. We started on September 9, and so far we have over 2500 canvassers in place, collecting signatures in every corner of the province.</p>

<p></p>
<p>This campaign has been remarkably successful so far. We have been featured in well over 200 newspaper and media articles. Our efforts have been endorsed by every major newspaper in the province, as well as a wide number of public health and social policy organizations.</p>
<p>However, we need more funding for this campaign to succeed. Even the printing costs will be phenomenal, in the range of $40,000 just for flyers, stickers and petition forms.</p>
<p>  The referendum victories in Colorado and Washington are still new and fragile. A referendum victory across the border in BC will help to solidify those victories and ensure there is no turning back.</p>
<p>  All donations that we receive are being matched by a generous donor named Bob Erb. Bob is a BC marijuana enthusiast who won the lottery last year, and has pledged to match every single donation we get. What easier way to double your money and support a good cause?</p>
<p>Thank you for all that you do. Together, we will decriminalize marijuana in BC.</p>

<h2><strong>Ever wonder if Dante Alighieri had any descendants?</strong></h2>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am first a dad and a husband. Secondly, I'm a writer who created the character of <em>Haven</em> for the graphic novel that released in 2010 as a response to the assault that my wife experienced many years ago.</p>
<p>By retaining the prose rights to the <em>Haven</em> universe, I'm able to bring you <strong><em>Haven of Dante: The Staff of Moshe</em></strong> which answers the question of where Haven was during the two years she had disappeared from this Earth and launch a series of novels that will bring a deeper understanding to readers of the characters in this world while bringing a ray of hope to those who have suffered the same atrocious violation.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our needs are simple:</p>
<p>Editing, Production and Distribution</p>
<p>The editing cost is the bulk of the expense and for a full-length novel that can be quite expensive. Production includes formatting into E-books for Kindle, Nook, and iPad among others. We'll also need physical copies for libraries and schools.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong><em>Peter Skagen's manuscript is a winner on so many levels, and should be required reading for any student of acting. </em></strong><strong>While the title implies the craft of film acting, many of the lessons are of universal importance, whether acting for film, stage, or promoting a stand-up act.  When I came back to auditioning for film roles after many years away I took one of Peter's classes, and his no-nonsense approach to the business was in large part responsible for me booking a feature film and a guest role on series television within 2 months of the class.  This book follows that tradition.  It debunks myths, it sets goals, it kicks your butt when needed. I do not book everything--no one does.  But when I do it is Peter's voice in my head that gets me there.  If you cannot actually take class with this man, buy this book.  You will not regret it.</strong></p>
<p><span style="""">From student Esther Huang</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><span style="""">""What I like about Peter's teaching is that is is so straight forward, common sense, and understandable. There are so many teachers who ramble about getting in touch with 'creativity' with lifestyle suggestions, but have no specific or concrete words to offer. The best thing that you could is take Peter's class when you are getting started, and save yourself a lot of confusion and vague platitudes.""</span></p>

From Dr. Reid Spencer, Dept. of Theater, Speech and Music, Mount Royal University
Peter Skagen's manuscript is a winner on so many levels, and should be required reading for any student of acting. While the title implies the craft of film acting, many of the lessons are of universal importance, whether acting for film, stage, or promoting a stand-up act.  When I came back to auditioning for film roles after many years away I took one of Peter's classes, and his no-nonsense approach to the business was in large part responsible for me booking a feature film and a guest role on series television within 2 months of the class.  This book follows that tradition.  It debunks myths, it sets goals, it kicks your butt when needed. I do not book everything--no one does.  But when I do it is Peter's voice in my head that gets me there.  If you cannot actually take class with this man, buy this book.  You will not regret it.
From student Esther Huang
""What I like about Peter's teaching is that is is so straight forward, common sense, and understandable. There are so many teachers who ramble about getting in touch with 'creativity' with lifestyle suggestions, but have no specific or concrete words to offer. The best thing that you could is take Peter's class when you are getting started, and save yourself a lot of confusion and vague platitudes.""

In fact to be specific this play informs on the lives of people somewhere in West Africa.</p><p><b> <u>OBJECTIVES</u></b></p><p>  Our objective is to create awareness about Africa and their culture to people in continents other than Africa, and at large the world. This play focuses on life in African; this project will shed more light to people in countries other than Africa on the values and traditions on the African continent. As a matter of fact, we traveled to six West African countries to prepare our research. From our research we came up with a lot of information and as such, we decided to put them in a simple play so it can be easily understood by all. It took our research team about 5 years to bring forward this play namely: “Happy Grey Hair”. A play with an ingredient of real and probable situation as it is peculiar to people on the African continent.</p><p>  Based on our research, we found out an important problem which faces all rapidly developing countries; the need to preserve good traditions, norms and at the same time graft upon them when and where appropriate. That is one reason why in Africa, there are several cultural organization which encourage not only the local art but also to widen the scope to include the arts of neighboring countries like Europe and other parts of the world.</p><p>  But it does not only have to foster the arts which appeal to the eyes or ears but rather take into account that which appeals to the intellect and moral aspect of man.</p><p>  To bring this information to all with a taste of pragmatism, we want to dramatize this information. Drama had always been a means in which one can catch the conscience of people and to achieve this, we wrote this play with the intention of dramatizing it such that our audiences will understand the situation in the  play.</p><p><b><u>AIM</u></b></p><p>  Our aim is to dramatize this play on African’s soil with characters familiar to the ordinary Africans. This will go a long way to give the true impression that the various West African communities have many problems, feeling and interest in common.“Happy Grey Hair” is designed to achieve this at the primary phase and that is why we are lobbying the general public via indiegogo and through other platforms to help make this a reality because the benefits we stand to derive far outwit its cost.</p><p><b><u>GOALS</u></b></p><p>  Our immediate goal is an amount equivalent to $500  and this is intended to be used to kickstart  this project afterwards,we intend to press on so as to reach our long term goal of  $100000 and above. It is our goal to use the money raised to hire  dramatists familiar to the ordinary Africans  as well as dramatists who will dramatize for us on voluntary basis to dramatize this play on African’s soil. Afterward, we also intend to use various media platforms in African to popularize our drama and as such create an awareness campaign globally about the African people.</p><p>  It is our intention to foster this educational campaign by creating more plays on the lifestyle, values, norms, people, ups and downs, etc. common to Africans and further in African communities in various parts of the world.

<p>Most of the money from this campaign will go toward transportation costs and accomadation. I will be departing from Chicago on June 2nd and start off my journey in the Yucatan, making my way up to center of the country before rounding my way down through Latin America by bus. I then plan on flying from Managua to Cancun where I'll be able to make the 1 and 1/2 hour flight to Havana and stay there for about a week before returning to Cancun, where I will be flying back to the states. The final leg of the journey will be  a roadtrip west down through U.S. Route 50, the loneliest road in America. </p>

</div><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact:</h3><div>With this 'Snapshot of the Americas' project, I hope to establish a bridge between the past and present, allowing people the opportunity to reflect on the changes that have occurred over time in the Americas. And while two months is no where near enough time to get an exhaustive picture this region's present landscape, this project will give me a glimpse into the lives of the people that inhabit these regions and help me highlight a few the faults and virtues of their present state. While financial support is an important part of the project, having a community of readers and supporters is important as well, as it will open up the field for interpretation and allow the readers and external community the opportunity to act accordingly and help promote certain causes I may document. <br/>
</div><p></p><p></p><h3>What Your Support Means: </h3><p></p><p>While I would be thrilled if this project were to be fully funded, the project will still take place to a smaller scale if I don't reach my entire goal, where I will be traveling only to Mexico, Guatemala and the United States, hitting less spots along the way. I am committed to this project I and am excited to see it out and the impact it can have on the world. <b><i>Any donation, in any amount, is greatly appreciated! </i></b></p><p>Still, these are hard times and I know not everyone will want to or be able to contribute financially. Regardless of your decision, I value your feedback-- please share this project widely and feel free to contact me about friends in the countries I will be traveling to who might want to speak with me, or ideas you have on how I can make this project better.</p><br/></div>","Some of my Stories: Modern Day Tesla: http://www.dailyillini.com/lifeandculture/aroundcampus/article_ddd5fa52-8882-11e3-908d-001a4bcf6878.htmlSouth African Freedom Day:  http://www.dailyillini.com/lifeandculture/aroundcampus/article_05a91db2-ca81-11e3-a02b-001a4bcf6878.html""A Revolutionary Fellow:  http://www.dailyillini.com/lifeandculture/aroundcampus/article_5c68fe2e-cff4-11e3-9a8d-001a4bcf6878.htmlSochi LGBT Issues:  http://www.dailyillini.com/lifeandculture/aroundcampus/article_5c68fe2e-cff4-11e3-9a8d-001a4bcf6878.html My Pictures: https://www.flickr.com/photos/83621498@N02/

I will be departing from Chicago on June 2nd and start off my journey in the Yucatan, making my way up to center of the country before rounding my way down through Latin America by bus. I then plan on flying from Managua to Cancun where I'll be able to make the 1 and 1/2 hour flight to Havana and stay there for about a week before returning to Cancun, where I will be flying back to the states. The final leg of the journey will be  a roadtrip west down through U.S. Route 50, the loneliest road in America. 

The Impact:With this 'Snapshot of the Americas' project, I hope to establish a bridge between the past and present, allowing people the opportunity to reflect on the changes that have occurred over time in the Americas. And while two months is no where near enough time to get an exhaustive picture this region's present landscape, this project will give me a glimpse into the lives of the people that inhabit these regions and help me highlight a few the faults and virtues of their present state. While financial support is an important part of the project, having a community of readers and supporters is important as well, as it will open up the field for interpretation and allow the readers and external community the opportunity to act accordingly and help promote certain causes I may document. 
What Your Support Means: While I would be thrilled if this project were to be fully funded, the project will still take place to a smaller scale if I don't reach my entire goal, where I will be traveling only to Mexico, Guatemala and the United States, hitting less spots along the way. I am committed to this project I and am excited to see it out and the impact it can have on the world. Any donation, in any amount, is greatly appreciated! Still, these are hard times and I know not everyone will want to or be able to contribute financially. Regardless of your decision, I value your feedback-- please share this project widely and feel free to contact me about friends in the countries I will be traveling to who might want to speak with me, or ideas you have on how I can make this project better.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>UPDATE:</b> The book deal is not happening. I decided to not sign the contract.<br/><br/>For those who want refunds, I will honour that. <br/><br/>However, I will keep this fundraiser going. One of the things I'm going to need is a website to promote not only my fiction, but my corporate work, so -- if what's below doesn't come to pass -- certainly, any funding will go either go towards a useful marketing tool, or I will refund it once my funds are in hand. Thanks to all who have contributed so far. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I have some exciting news to share -- and I want YOU to be a part of it. :-)<br/><br/>I
 want to give you some background and talk about something positive that
 is happening for me, and then I will talk about your potential role in 
this. <p></p>
<div>And if you don't want to contribute, that's fine. I totally respect that.<p></p>
<p>So here's the scoop:</p>
<p>I
 could very well, by spring 2015, have my debut short story collection, 
Terrible Things Happen, published by an indie publisher in Texas. Sounds not too bad, right? </p>
<div>Get this.<br/><br/><div>It gets better.<p></p>
<p></p>
<div>I've reached out to a few authors in Canada and America about potential book blurbs, if they like my work.<p></p>
<div>I
 can't tell you who I might have lined up, but a few have expressed 
interest in reading the manuscript. If they like the work, they will 
blurb it.<p></p>
<p>None
 are household names, per se, but they're mid-list authors with books 
published by major publishers. If I get these blurbs, you might go, 
""Wow! How did you get so-and-so with major publishing credentials to 
blurb your book?""</p>
<p>The
 publisher is looking at 1,000 copies for an initial print run. I'm not 
making money up front, more on that in a second, but the royalties are 
very generous. </p>
<div>I've
 done due diligence on the publisher. I had a friend with some 
publishing experience do some digging, and she found that this appeared 
legit. I phoned the publisher, and the publisher picked up the phone at 
the number that was provided. The site itself retails books, as well as 
provide ways to order via Amazon and Barnes and Noble.<br/><br/><div>The
 publisher has some media clout. The main woman who runs the business 
was a media spokesperson in a past life. She has a bio in the Internet 
Movie Database -- granted, you can probably pay to get that, but, still,
 it's kind of neat. The publisher web site lists ""media affiliations"", 
including logos for Fox and MTV, among others. Now, if this publisher 
didn't have those connections, I would imagine that these media 
companies -- and there are a few, big and small -- would be on the horn 
to their lawyer pretty quickly. Maybe these things *can* fly under the 
radar, but, so far, it's looking like the company is not a scam, per se.<div>
<br/>So this is all great, right?<p></p>
<p>Here's the difficult part. </p>
<div>The
 publisher is what the industry calls a ""hybrid publisher"". This means 
that the publisher shifts the onus of risk from themselves to the author
 by asking the author to front some of the cost of publishing. <div>
<br/>Now,
 in my mind, this is ""pay to play"". I'm not the type of person who 
necessarily agrees with that sentiment, and I feel that money should 
flow to the author and not the other way around. <p></p>
<p>I told the publisher this. </p>
<p>The publisher then cut me a deal. </p>
<p>And I have a few thoughts about this, but, first, the deal.</p>
<p>The
 publisher is willing to produce the collection for a grand total of 
$1,000 US up front. They have a tier-pay model where you can pay $1,500 
to get some things done, and up to $4,000 to get even more in return. </p>
<div>So,
 basically, the publisher said to me: we like your work, we like your 
track record, we like your ability to hustle. We will give you the 
$4,000 package for a quarter of the cost. <div>
<br/>So here's what I think.<p></p>
<p>Publishing
 is a risk. This is a short story collection, which is harder to sell 
than novels. Plus, I'm a Canadian dealing with an American market. So 
that's strike two. </p>
<div>There
 is no such thing as a ""perfect"" publishing deal. I'll paint a scenario 
for you. Say a major publishing house came to me to write a novel, and 
paid me an advance up front. I write the novel. The publisher then 
publishes the work and then does zero to market it. <div>
<br/>So
 this is a balance. The publisher is willing to cut a deal, I'll get 500
 books (if not more if this is successful), they seem willing to do 
their share of marketing so long as I do my share on my end, and they're
 offering pretty good royalties -- so I'll get paid a set amount on each
 of the individual copies sold.<p></p>
<p>Naturally, there are still some details to hammer out -- but this seems, so far, like a fair deal, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>My
 work is a bit out in left field, so this is as good a shot as any. I've
 tried approaching more traditional publishers, who, incidentally, get 
their money from grants, and they're not interested in the book just 
because it's short stories and they feel they can't market that right 
now. I've gotten very nice rejection letters, but it's ""sorry, this is 
too much of a risk for us.""</p>
<p>All
 of that said: I've really considered this. Yes, there's some risk. But,
 as I said, there is no such thing as a ""perfect"" deal. You have to meet
 people halfway, and, so far, this publisher is willing to negotiate 
with me. I can respect that. </p>
<p>Yes,
 I can self publish. But then I'm shouldering all of the costs myself. 
Plus, I'm less likely to garner any sort of publicity for the work. 
Distribution becomes harder. And, truth be told, I'm not the type to 
haggle over what kind of paper should be used and what kind of ink 
should be used. I've been there. Not for me.</p>
<p>At
 least here, there seems to be ways into the American media market. The 
publisher is going to do the cover art and edit (even though the 
manuscript is pretty clean, and I have my own editors working on this). 
So it's a balance.</p>
<div>Here's the deal.<p></p>
<p>This
 year was a tough year for me financially. I went into debt after my 
last contract ended. I really can't afford the $1,000 right now out of 
my own pocket.</p>
<p>But then I thought: crowdfunding.</p>
<p>If I can get 20 people to kick in $50 US at least, that's all I'd need.</p>
<p>So after all of this blather and preamble, here's what I can offer YOU:</p>
<p>If
 you kick in $50 US, I will make sure you not only get a copy of the 
book, signed by me with whatever personal message you want in it, I will
 also personally thank you in the acknowledgements section. If you ever 
wanted to see your name in print (spelled correctly; I used to be a 
journalist after all), here you go. I'm trying to think of other things I
 can do for you, so I'm also open to suggestions.</p>
<div>What
 I'm also thinking about is the whole kit and kaboodle. If some generous
 benefactor wants to put in the full $1,000 US -- here's what I can do.<p></p>
<p>I'm already working on my second short story collection. If this book is a success, well you know there's a follow-up.</p>
<p>What I'll do, for the full amount, is the following:</p>
<p>Put
 you as a character in a story, with your name, and build a story around
 you. I will interview you, find out what you like and don't like (ie. 
if you don't want to be killed off in a story, I won't do it), and do 
everything in my power to create a work of art that hopefully fits with 
the theme of the collection I have in mind. </p>
<div>Hopefully,
 this sounds copacetic. I'm trying, too, to figure out what I can do for
 more mid-range donations (ie. $100, $250, and so on). Naturally, I 
don't have ""swag"" right now, but I'm open to suggestions -- as long as 
they are legal, don't go against my integrity and morals, and are 
doable. :-)<div>
<br/>If the book, for whatever reason, doesn't see the light of day, I'll fully refund you. That's the risk I'm willing to take. <p></p>
<p>Also,
 I'm going to need funding fairly quickly. The publisher wants copy 
finalized by the end of January for a spring publication date.</p>
<div>So,
 I hope you can help out and that you're willing to become a part of 
something that's important to me. This is a 15 year dream for me, 
getting a collection published. I truly believe in my work, a lot of 
people have said good things about it.<p></p>
<p>Oh,
 one of the stories in the collection was nominated for a US Pushcart 
Prize. And I also received grant money to finish the collection some 
time ago. So I hope this speaks to the quality of the material. :-)</p>

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p><span>     </span>My name is Nazia Islam. I am a soon to be
graduate of Syracuse University with a degree in anthropology. I have decided
that this would be a good time to  begin working on a memoir. I am
creating this campaign to raise funds to start working on a memoir.</p>
<p><span>        </span>I was born in Bangladesh, but I would come
over to the United States when I was one years old with my parents. I have no memory
of the place where I was born. This makes me a second generation American of
Bengali heritage. Bengali-American (or as I like to call it Ameringali). This
memoir is about the hyphen identity I would embrace in college. </p>
<p>      I never thought I would grow up to
want to become a writer. When I was little I wanted be an artist specifically a
painter (the future Bob Ross) or a cartoonist. My interests in writing did not
manifest until I was about fourteen years old. Up until that point I was an
avid reader and a kid who did her homework as soon as she got home so that she
could practice her sketching. I spent most of my childhood alone. I was
isolated in school and for the most part bullied. Up until middle school I was
the only South Asian and only Muslim in my class. My peers misunderstood my
background and my parents, first generation immigrants, also had a tough time
navigating their surroundings. We lived in a predominantly Italian-American
town. There was this ""othering"" happening from both sides.  For
a while I resented my cultural heritage but I never could fit in with everyone

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
     My name is Nazia Islam. I am a soon to be
graduate of Syracuse University with a degree in anthropology. I have decided
that this would be a good time to  begin working on a memoir. I am
creating this campaign to raise funds to start working on a memoir.
        I was born in Bangladesh, but I would come
over to the United States when I was one years old with my parents. I have no memory
of the place where I was born. This makes me a second generation American of
Bengali heritage. Bengali-American (or as I like to call it Ameringali). This
memoir is about the hyphen identity I would embrace in college. 
      I never thought I would grow up to
want to become a writer. When I was little I wanted be an artist specifically a
painter (the future Bob Ross) or a cartoonist. My interests in writing did not
manifest until I was about fourteen years old. Up until that point I was an
avid reader and a kid who did her homework as soon as she got home so that she
could practice her sketching. I spent most of my childhood alone. I was
isolated in school and for the most part bullied. Up until middle school I was
the only South Asian and only Muslim in my class. My peers misunderstood my
background and my parents, first generation immigrants, also had a tough time
navigating their surroundings. We lived in a predominantly Italian-American
town. There was this ""othering"" happening from both sides.  For
a while I resented my cultural heritage but I never could fit in with everyone
else at school. I was a child living in a cultural mish-mosh limbo.(more about
that will be in the book)  
          Back to writing. At the age of fifteen, I
slipped into depression because of all of this along with family issues that
were arising. I began to become conscious of all that was happening in the world.
Post 9/11 is the most obvious but even more than that. It was everything that
bothered and upset me. Poverty, war, disaster, racism, politics, sexism

<h3>Our Story (from Michael Hebb) </h3>
<p>Hey America - my name is Michael Hebb. And On April 18th I took the mainstage at TEDMED to tell the world about a project called “Let’s Have Dinner and Talk About Death.”</p>
<p>You might be wondering - What the hell is wrong with me? and why I would want to have Americans stop – gather their friends – and have a conversation about how we End our Lives. </p>
<p> 9 months ago - I was sitting in the dining car of a train – and I started a conversation with two strangers. they were both medical doctors – and shortly into the conversation we began to discuss how messed up our healthcare system is.... </p>
<p>I learned that End of Life expense was the number 1 reason for bankruptcy in the U.S. and that over 75% of Americans want to die at home and yet only 25% do – half of us are not getting what we want – what we are entitled to - and paying dearly for it. </p>
<p>I was shocked – but outrage quickly turned to inspiration – and it occurred to me that How We End Our Lives is the most important and costly conversation America isn’t having. We talk about war and the environment – but we don’t talk about Death – of all of these issues that face us – Death is the most certain. </p>
<p> In the past 20 years I have found that the dinner table is an immensely powerful place to have difficult conversations – deepen relationships – and begin action. In the next six months – myself and design firm Civilization – will be building a beautiful interactive website and mobile platform to give everyone the tools to stop – set a table – and host a conversation that is definitely not just about our final days – but how we want to live to the fullest – and honor the wishes of those we love most. We have been working with zero budget for the last nine months – thanks to the generosity and support of the University of Washington and Olson Kundig architects. </p>
<p>We have gathered a rock star advisor board of some of the most influential and brilliant people in Health Care and Wellness – and now we need a little help finishing up the work so that we can share it with the world – and everyone can have access to this life affirming work.</p>

<h3>What Are You Funding? </h3>
<p>Design firm CIVILIZATION has been working tirelessly on this project for the past nine months without funding or payment.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>The fate of the struggling American colonies depends on the actions of one man...</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Time separates hero from villain and friend from foe. After an act of treason, committed at the request of King George III, Captain Arthur F. Nelson and his crew find themselves the victims of a set-up that leads them straight to the gallows.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>As their death sentence is read aloud, the curse of Blood Bones is set in motion once again, transporting them several hundred years in the future.</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Captain Nelson leads a group of his loyal comrades on a daunting quest to return back to 1763 to save Benjamin Manry and the remaining crew that were captured by the cutthroat Richard Highmore.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Follow Captain Nelson and his colleagues as they go under ‘pirate’ cover in this exciting and fast-paced story. Will they succeed in the rescue of our young hero? Or will they fail in their efforts?</span> </p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><strong>The fate of the future United States of America rests in Benjamin Manry’s rescue...</strong></span></p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p>My name is Owen Palmiotti. I'm 27 years old. I tend to keep busy: I teach navigation at SUNY Maritime, am a reservist in the US Navy, pursuing my Masters degree, and write short stories/novels/screenplays. Benjamin Manry and the Scarlet Stone is the third novel of an open-ended trilogy. I'd like to do a few more books down the road, but for now it's all about marketing and spreading the word about the Young Adult Fiction series.</p>
<p>The Benjamin Manry series actually started when I was 13 years old. I had this ""recurring"" dream that literally lasted a month straight. Each night, I added more to it, until finally, I told all my friends and family. They loved it. They pushed me to write, and write I did. That was over half my life ago! Where does time go? Seriously?</p>
<p>My goal is to raise money to cover the expenses of self-publishing. Between publishing costs, editing costs, and all the minor fees that add up, I'd like to attempt to break even upon the release of the book (I wish I thought of using Indiegogo for the first two books!). That would be amazing if WE could accomplish this :)</p>
<p>I use the word WE, because it really is about you and me. Without a reader, my book would sit on a shelf and collect dust. We can't let that happen!</p>
<p>Obviously, raising $2,500 is my initial goal, but I've got my eyes set on bigger and better things: movie deals, book signing tours, etc. I arranged twelve events/signings back in 2012, and am already scheduling a big Summer/Fall tour for 2013. </p>
<p>What I think separates myself from other authors is that I dress in character. My main character's name is Benjamin Manry. He's this really odd (based off me of course) guy from modern day who discovers a cursed pirate treasure. After being sent back to 1763, he sort of creates a footstep that changes history. </p>
<p>It's kind of epic, seriously.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<p>As stated earlier, I would like to raise $2,500 to cover the cost of publishing/editing, as well as schedule a book signing tour. I'd like the tour to cover the globe, but that's pretty ambitious of me. I'll be honest, I love standing in front of people telling them about my characters, my stories, and myself.</p>
<p>If you contribute and become part of the Owen Team, I'll hook you up with an autographed book with a personalized inscription upon its release. Maybe even a photograph of me dressed as Benjamin Manry. I'm also thinking of personalized visits in costume. Schools? Birthday Parties? It doesn't matter :) Those are sort of low-ball things, but if you want to really help me out, I'll even put you in my next book! Imagine...a character with your name, based off you...all because you helped out a little guy like me? If you don't think that's awesome, I am at a loss for words! On a scale of 1 to excited, where are ya?!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since I was a kid, I've always had this big dream of walking into a little book store in an airport on the other side of the world. I'd be browsing for some random book waiting on a connection flight...and guess what I see? My book!</p>

<p>-Owen</p></div>","Short Summary
The fate of the struggling American colonies depends on the actions of one man...
Time separates hero from villain and friend from foe. After an act of treason, committed at the request of King George III, Captain Arthur F. Nelson and his crew find themselves the victims of a set-up that leads them straight to the gallows.
As their death sentence is read aloud, the curse of Blood Bones is set in motion once again, transporting them several hundred years in the future.
Captain Nelson leads a group of his loyal comrades on a daunting quest to return back to 1763 to save Benjamin Manry and the remaining crew that were captured by the cutthroat Richard Highmore.
Follow Captain Nelson and his colleagues as they go under ‘pirate’ cover in this exciting and fast-paced story. Will they succeed in the rescue of our young hero? Or will they fail in their efforts? 
The fate of the future United States of America rests in Benjamin Manry’s rescue...
 
My name is Owen Palmiotti. I'm 27 years old. I tend to keep busy: I teach navigation at SUNY Maritime, am a reservist in the US Navy, pursuing my Masters degree, and write short stories/novels/screenplays. Benjamin Manry and the Scarlet Stone is the third novel of an open-ended trilogy. I'd like to do a few more books down the road, but for now it's all about marketing and spreading the word about the Young Adult Fiction series.
The Benjamin Manry series actually started when I was 13 years old. I had this ""recurring"" dream that literally lasted a month straight. Each night, I added more to it, until finally, I told all my friends and family. They loved it. They pushed me to write, and write I did. That was over half my life ago! Where does time go? Seriously?
My goal is to raise money to cover the expenses of self-publishing. Between publishing costs, editing costs, and all the minor fees that add up, I'd like to attempt to break even upon the release of the book (I wish I thought of using Indiegogo for the first two books!). That would be amazing if WE could accomplish this :)
I use the word WE, because it really is about you and me. Without a reader, my book would sit on a shelf and collect dust. We can't let that happen!
Obviously, raising $2,500 is my initial goal, but I've got my eyes set on bigger and better things: movie deals, book signing tours, etc. I arranged twelve events/signings back in 2012, and am already scheduling a big Summer/Fall tour for 2013. 
What I think separates myself from other authors is that I dress in character. My main character's name is Benjamin Manry. He's this really odd (based off me of course) guy from modern day who discovers a cursed pirate treasure. After being sent back to 1763, he sort of creates a footstep that changes history. 
It's kind of epic, seriously.


 
What We Need & What You Get
Here are the details:
As stated earlier, I would like to raise $2,500 to cover the cost of publishing/editing, as well as schedule a book signing tour. I'd like the tour to cover the globe, but that's pretty ambitious of me. I'll be honest, I love standing in front of people telling them about my characters, my stories, and myself.
If you contribute and become part of the Owen Team, I'll hook you up with an autographed book with a personalized inscription upon its release. Maybe even a photograph of me dressed as Benjamin Manry. I'm also thinking of personalized visits in costume. Schools? Birthday Parties? It doesn't matter :) Those are sort of low-ball things, but if you want to really help me out, I'll even put you in my next book! Imagine...a character with your name, based off you...all because you helped out a little guy like me? If you don't think that's awesome, I am at a loss for words! On a scale of 1 to excited, where are ya?!
 


The Impact
Since I was a kid, I've always had this big dream of walking into a little book store in an airport on the other side of the world. I'd be browsing for some random book waiting on a connection flight...and guess what I see? My book!
I published my first novel in 2008, and have been pursuing the endeavor since. The most memorable thing so far was when I was just arriving at a store for a signing and ACTUALLY bumping into someone I didn't know who was waiting for it to start. There was a family who heard about it through a friend who read my first book, and it was the coolest thing in the world.

<p></p><p>Kyle Hill</p>
<p><b>ONE-SENTENCE DESCRIPTION</b></p>
<p>This book offers
encouragement and empowers readers to break free from the mundane 9-5
existence, follow their dreams and do what they love to do. </p>
<p><b>CATEGORY</b></p>
<p>Self-Help/Personal
Development</p>
<h3><b>The Audience<br/></b></h3>
<p>The hundreds of
millions of people worldwide who are unhappily working a job they don’t really
like, struggling day in and day out to make ends meet - just to pay their ever
increasing bills, taxes and debts. The book is primarily targeted towards people
in the 18 - 35 age group and is unbiased toward any religion, culture or sex.</p>
<h3><b>Purpose And Need<br/></b></h3>
<p>Everyday there are
billions of people across the globe, waking up to do a job they don’t like or
want; just to live within their means and live a mediocre life. People are
becoming fed up of this way of life, and The Winner’s Guide is the answer to
their problems.</p>
<p>The most amazing,
talented and gifted people in the world are forgoing a life of unlimited
wealth, happiness and success because the economic system we’re all part of has conditioned people to believe that living our dreams is something
outwith our ability. </p>
<p>In reality, every
single human being on the planet has the ability and opportunity to do something
great with their lives, if only they can begin to change their thinking to that
of a winner. The Winner’s Guide introduces its readers to a way of thinking
that will change their lives forever.</p>
<p>The Winner’s Guide
is a beautifully composed inspirational true story of how an unhappy,
uneducated young man finds himself stuck in a job he hates, working tirelessly just
make ends meet - wondering if life is really worth living? Through an
unfortunate chain of events and stroke of luck, he is gifted with knowledge that
completely changes his life for the better. Equipped with this new knowledge,
he embarks on a breathtaking journey full of exciting twists and turns,
romantic encounters, and incredible highs and lows. A journey that would help
him discover his purpose, find true love, success and happiness in the process.</p>
<p>This book is written
in plain English, designed to appeal to readers from all backgrounds, cultures,
religions and experiences. It’s easily accessible to those who don’t know much
about the power of their minds, yet the book’s message is solidly evangelical,
theologically accurate, and culturally informed. The chapters include
contemporary real-life stories and insights from a wide spectrum of scenarios
and life lessons.</p><p><b>PROPOSED BLURB</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/433255/files/20140314065552-coverback.jpg?1394805352"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p><b>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</b></p>
<p>Not one for following
conventional paths in his young life, Kyle Hill is a born serial entrepreneur
with a burning desire to make a positive difference in the world. </p>
<p><b>Author’s Mission:</b> To inspire and give people the opportunity to find true
happiness, living the life of their dreams and doing what they were born to do. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Kyle is a self-made, self-driven success story and has
various successful online ventures under his belt. He prides himself in having
generated over £500,000 in online sales without any direct advertising spend. </p>
<p>Starting his first online
business with meagre 3 figure sum in 2010, Kyle went on to achieve sales in
excess of £15,000 per month within 6 months of starting up. </p>
<p>Kyle’s business
experience includes, but certainly isn’t limited to, negotiating high value
investment deals, launching and marketing innovative products across various
media platforms and influencing and inspiring 1000’s of people around the
world. </p>
<p>Kyle continues to
motivate, inspire and actively encourage others to approach life in a similar
manner, regularly coaching and consulting for businesses ranging from start-ups
to public traded companies. </p>
<p>Kyle's journey has seen
him travel the world, gaining invaluable life experience that has all, in some
way, contributed to the creation of what will soon become an international best
seller - <i>‘The Winner’s Guide’. </i></p>
<p><b>AUTHOR PROMOTION</b></p>
<p>Kyle is an
Internet marketing expert (6+ years experience, over £500k in sales online) who
will proactively promote <i>The Winner’s Guide </i>via
various digital channels. As well, the author has created <i>The Winner’s Guide</i> Web
site (<a href=""http://www.winnersguide.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.winnersguide.com</a>), which will be home to an influential blog and a wide
variety of valuable ‘Self-Help’ content designed to attract high volumes of
traffic to the brand. </p>
<p>Kyle is also
developing other mass media and e-promotional author promotion strategies
that will reach the target audience. For example, Kyle would like to run
an advertising campaign on bus, train and underground services in most major
cities – targeted at unhappy commuters on their way to work.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>How The Campaign Money Will Be Spent:</p><ul>
<li>£2,200 in initial stock to cover contributor rewards and introducing the book to various eBook providers.<br/>
</li>
<li>£1,000 for the development of WinnersGuide.com</li>
<li>£800 for professional editing services.</li>
<li>£1,000 for miscellaneous legal costs such as campaign funding, trademark protection, ISBN numbers etc.</li>
</ul><p>I feel this financial start would provide a strong launch platform to bring this book to the market successfully. I'm confident with my vast experience in online marketing, combined with the attraction of the book - the business can become self sufficient and I'll be able to reach more people with my message. As I'm self-publishing, the book has to be regarded as a business which must grow in order for the book to reach more people.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Questions</h2><p></p><p></p><h4>Why Do The Book Perks Seem Expensive?</h4><p>Not only will you receive 
one of the very first copies of what I believe will be an international 
best seller. You'll also be contributing to bringing the idea to 
reality. In a way, you'll be doing your own piece for changing the 
world.</p><b><h4>What Happens If I Don't Reach My Target?<br/>
</h4></b><p></p>I'm
 
confident we will reach the target. However, if I don't you will still receive your perk as I'll find alternative funding to cover my costs.<br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h4>Why I Don't Want To Have It Professionally Published?</h4><p></p><p>Although
 I've considered this option carefully - I believe the people this book 
will benefit the most, are the people that wouldn't normally purchase a 
book or aren't in a position to pay for it. It's my intention to eventually (within 6-12 months) give the <i>Winner's Guide</i> away for free as a Kindle/eBook download, so everyone has the opportunity to benefit from it. Giving a book away for free, isn't something the big publishers are interested in doing.</p><p></p><h4>Will I Profit From The Book?</h4><p>Writing the <i>Winner's Guide</i>
 was never about the money. I've reached a point in my life where I'm 
happy with or without money, and this is part of what I want to share 
with the world. As you'll learn from the book, I wrote the Winner's 
Guide as a gift. <br/></p><p>Of course, the <i>Winner's Guide</i>
 brand will generate revenue through the sale of the physical book and 
advertising on our website (<a href=""http://www.winnersguide.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.winnersguide.com</a>) - but rest assured a 
significant percentage of this revenue will be reinvested into marketing
 and distributing the book in different languages to help more people 
benefit from it. </p><p></p><h4>Which Stage Is The Book At?</h4><p>The
 book is approximately 95% complete just now. I've written 170 pages, 
53000 words and I estimate there will be 190 -200 pages, 70000 words. 
I'm in the final process of piecing together my story and would like to 
write about this fundraising experience within the book, so I can advise
 others on how to do it when they find their purpose. The book then 
needs to be professionally edited, proofread and given to a select 
number of people to gather feedback. </p><p>Once I'm satisfied the 
book is ready, we'll have the first run of copies printed and dispatched
 to everyone who has contributed to the campaign. We'll then launch the 
book on our website and Amazon for public sale. </p>You can download the introduction chapter as a PDF <a href=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/1297326/files/20140314065245-samplechapterWG.pdf?1394805168"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a><br/><br/><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p><ul>

<p><i>In the context of a roller coaster. Our youth is the beginning of the
 ride and we shoot off into the unknown. We climb a daunting hill only

suddenly we drop into the massive loop of life. Our stomachs churn with

Over the last 6 months I've been writing my first book; The Winner's Guide. A book, I wholeheartedly believe can inspire millions of people around the world to break free from a job they don't enjoy to find happiness, contentment and financial freedom doing what they love to do whilst following their dreams. Using my own personal experience, intertwined with practical advice and knowledge which I've been blessed with along the journey - I have created a book I believe will capture the hearts of it's readers and help them find the belief in themselves to pursue their dreams and find true happiness in their lives. I want to teach people the following;
To think positively and understand the power of their minds.
To find and monetize their passion, finding financial freedom from anywhere in the world.
To find true love and develop meaningful relationships with friends and family.
To find happiness, health and contentment in all aspects of their lives.
To wake up every morning, with a sense of excitement and joy for the day ahead.
And much more. About The Book

AUTHOR
Kyle Hill
ONE-SENTENCE DESCRIPTION
This book offers
encouragement and empowers readers to break free from the mundane 9-5
existence, follow their dreams and do what they love to do. 
CATEGORY
Self-Help/Personal
Development
The Audience
The hundreds of
millions of people worldwide who are unhappily working a job they don’t really
like, struggling day in and day out to make ends meet - just to pay their ever
increasing bills, taxes and debts. The book is primarily targeted towards people
in the 18 - 35 age group and is unbiased toward any religion, culture or sex.
Purpose And Need
Everyday there are
billions of people across the globe, waking up to do a job they don’t like or
want; just to live within their means and live a mediocre life. People are
becoming fed up of this way of life, and The Winner’s Guide is the answer to
their problems.
The most amazing,
talented and gifted people in the world are forgoing a life of unlimited
wealth, happiness and success because the economic system we’re all part of has conditioned people to believe that living our dreams is something
outwith our ability. 
In reality, every
single human being on the planet has the ability and opportunity to do something
great with their lives, if only they can begin to change their thinking to that
of a winner. The Winner’s Guide introduces its readers to a way of thinking
that will change their lives forever.
The Winner’s Guide
is a beautifully composed inspirational true story of how an unhappy,
uneducated young man finds himself stuck in a job he hates, working tirelessly just
make ends meet - wondering if life is really worth living? Through an
unfortunate chain of events and stroke of luck, he is gifted with knowledge that
completely changes his life for the better. Equipped with this new knowledge,
he embarks on a breathtaking journey full of exciting twists and turns,
romantic encounters, and incredible highs and lows. A journey that would help
him discover his purpose, find true love, success and happiness in the process.
This book is written
in plain English, designed to appeal to readers from all backgrounds, cultures,
religions and experiences. It’s easily accessible to those who don’t know much
about the power of their minds, yet the book’s message is solidly evangelical,
theologically accurate, and culturally informed. The chapters include
contemporary real-life stories and insights from a wide spectrum of scenarios
and life lessons.PROPOSED BLURB
ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Not one for following
conventional paths in his young life, Kyle Hill is a born serial entrepreneur
with a burning desire to make a positive difference in the world. 
Author’s Mission: To inspire and give people the opportunity to find true
happiness, living the life of their dreams and doing what they were born to do. 
Kyle is a self-made, self-driven success story and has
various successful online ventures under his belt. He prides himself in having
generated over £500,000 in online sales without any direct advertising spend. 
Starting his first online
business with meagre 3 figure sum in 2010, Kyle went on to achieve sales in
excess of £15,000 per month within 6 months of starting up. 
Kyle’s business
experience includes, but certainly isn’t limited to, negotiating high value
investment deals, launching and marketing innovative products across various
media platforms and influencing and inspiring 1000’s of people around the
world. 
Kyle continues to
motivate, inspire and actively encourage others to approach life in a similar
manner, regularly coaching and consulting for businesses ranging from start-ups
to public traded companies. 
Kyle's journey has seen
him travel the world, gaining invaluable life experience that has all, in some
way, contributed to the creation of what will soon become an international best
seller - ‘The Winner’s Guide’. 
AUTHOR PROMOTION
Kyle is an
Internet marketing expert (6+ years experience, over £500k in sales online) who
will proactively promote The Winner’s Guide via
various digital channels. As well, the author has created The Winner’s Guide Web
site (www.winnersguide.com), which will be home to an influential blog and a wide
variety of valuable ‘Self-Help’ content designed to attract high volumes of
traffic to the brand. 
Kyle is also
developing other mass media and e-promotional author promotion strategies
that will reach the target audience. For example, Kyle would like to run
an advertising campaign on bus, train and underground services in most major
cities – targeted at unhappy commuters on their way to work.
What We Need & What You GetHow The Campaign Money Will Be Spent:
£2,200 in initial stock to cover contributor rewards and introducing the book to various eBook providers.

£1,000 for the development of WinnersGuide.com
£800 for professional editing services.
£1,000 for miscellaneous legal costs such as campaign funding, trademark protection, ISBN numbers etc.
I feel this financial start would provide a strong launch platform to bring this book to the market successfully. I'm confident with my vast experience in online marketing, combined with the attraction of the book - the business can become self sufficient and I'll be able to reach more people with my message. As I'm self-publishing, the book has to be regarded as a business which must grow in order for the book to reach more people.QuestionsWhy Do The Book Perks Seem Expensive?Not only will you receive 
one of the very first copies of what I believe will be an international 
best seller. You'll also be contributing to bringing the idea to 
reality. In a way, you'll be doing your own piece for changing the 
world.What Happens If I Don't Reach My Target?
I'm
 
confident we will reach the target. However, if I don't you will still receive your perk as I'll find alternative funding to cover my costs.Why I Don't Want To Have It Professionally Published?Although
 I've considered this option carefully - I believe the people this book 
will benefit the most, are the people that wouldn't normally purchase a 
book or aren't in a position to pay for it. It's my intention to eventually (within 6-12 months) give the Winner's Guide away for free as a Kindle/eBook download, so everyone has the opportunity to benefit from it. Giving a book away for free, isn't something the big publishers are interested in doing.Will I Profit From The Book?Writing the Winner's Guide
 was never about the money. I've reached a point in my life where I'm 
happy with or without money, and this is part of what I want to share 
with the world. As you'll learn from the book, I wrote the Winner's 
Guide as a gift. Of course, the Winner's Guide
 brand will generate revenue through the sale of the physical book and 
advertising on our website (www.winnersguide.com) - but rest assured a 
significant percentage of this revenue will be reinvested into marketing
 and distributing the book in different languages to help more people 
benefit from it. Which Stage Is The Book At?The
 book is approximately 95% complete just now. I've written 170 pages, 
53000 words and I estimate there will be 190 -200 pages, 70000 words. 
I'm in the final process of piecing together my story and would like to 
write about this fundraising experience within the book, so I can advise
 others on how to do it when they find their purpose. The book then 
needs to be professionally edited, proofread and given to a select 
number of people to gather feedback. Once I'm satisfied the 
book is ready, we'll have the first run of copies printed and dispatched
 to everyone who has contributed to the campaign. We'll then launch the 
book on our website and Amazon for public sale. You can download the introduction chapter as a PDF here.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

Samples Of My Work
You can download the introduction chapter in PDF format: here.This following example is taken from my blog: Moments: How To Live In Them 
We’ve all had good and bad times in our lives. Those incredible 
moments where you find yourself wanting to live forever and those 
moments where it seems like your world is caving in.
It’s the roller coaster ride of being a human being.
In the context of a roller coaster. Our youth is the beginning of the
 ride and we shoot off into the unknown. We climb a daunting hill only 
to reach the peak, pause, reflect, love the thrill of the moment and 
suddenly we drop into the massive loop of life. Our stomachs churn with 
terror but it’s fine, we know everything’s going to be OK. We know it’s 
part of the ride and that we have faith that we’ll reach the end in one 
piece before we even know it.
The moral of the story. You cannot change the past (you’re already on
 the ride), you have no control over the future – the only thing that is
 certain is the end. So instead of worrying about something you cannot 
change, or something you cannot control – why not focus your entire 
attention on the ride, the moment. Feel it, enjoy it, know that 
everything happens for a reason.
Have faith that if you live in and for the moment, the future will take care of itself.- You may copy and redistribute this article provided you link back to the campaign or winnersguide.com",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i><strong>Venus Genius: The Female Prescription for Innovation.</strong></i><br/><br/>My book will explore the world of innovation, the mysteries of the masculine and feminine brains - if such entities exist - as well as some juicy anecdotes of women’s daily lives in a world designed by men. It ends with a description of the feminine success formula: how to unlock some of your feminine traits to create meaningful and sustainable innovation that emotionally connects with consumers and brings value to the organization.<br/><br/>My name is Fabienne Jacquet and I am the author of <i>Venus Genius: the Female Prescription for Innovation.</i> I wrote this book because, in both my personal and professional life, I felt the need to reconnect to the feminine energy. In my 30+ years of experience in innovation and through research, I observed that creating from our emotions and heart is absolutely critical to create meaningful and sustainable innovation. And it’s not about “touchy-feeling.” It’s about business. Indeed, the female market represents a $20+ trillion opportunity. It’s untapped potential: research shows that most businesses fall short with female consumers because they are not maximizing their emotional bond with them.<br/><br/>So far, innovation has been mostly driven by process and rationale thinking. It’s time for women to have their voice at the innovation table, which has been dominated by the masculine for socio-historical reasons. I also believe that it is time for all innovators, regardless of their gender, to reconnect with their feminine energy to round up their skills profile and create meaningful innovation.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you have latent feminine skills and that, wherever you start in the masculine/feminine spectrum, rebalancing towards the opposite makes you a more centered human being in your personal and professional life. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for “innovation from the heart” in you. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand innovation, what makes it connect with people and how you can contribute to it.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the masculine and feminine brains contribution to innovation and how feminine traits like empathy, nurturing or intuition are key to create sustainable innovation. You'll read about stories including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How a young French chef used this feminine success formula to innovate a male-dominated industry</li>
<li>How starting from emotions allowed me to create successful innovation in a mundane category like shower gel</li>

Venus Genius: The Female Prescription for Innovation.My book will explore the world of innovation, the mysteries of the masculine and feminine brains - if such entities exist - as well as some juicy anecdotes of women’s daily lives in a world designed by men. It ends with a description of the feminine success formula: how to unlock some of your feminine traits to create meaningful and sustainable innovation that emotionally connects with consumers and brings value to the organization.My name is Fabienne Jacquet and I am the author of Venus Genius: the Female Prescription for Innovation. I wrote this book because, in both my personal and professional life, I felt the need to reconnect to the feminine energy. In my 30+ years of experience in innovation and through research, I observed that creating from our emotions and heart is absolutely critical to create meaningful and sustainable innovation. And it’s not about “touchy-feeling.” It’s about business. Indeed, the female market represents a $20+ trillion opportunity. It’s untapped potential: research shows that most businesses fall short with female consumers because they are not maximizing their emotional bond with them.So far, innovation has been mostly driven by process and rationale thinking. It’s time for women to have their voice at the innovation table, which has been dominated by the masculine for socio-historical reasons. I also believe that it is time for all innovators, regardless of their gender, to reconnect with their feminine energy to round up their skills profile and create meaningful innovation.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you have latent feminine skills and that, wherever you start in the masculine/feminine spectrum, rebalancing towards the opposite makes you a more centered human being in your personal and professional life. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for “innovation from the heart” in you. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand innovation, what makes it connect with people and how you can contribute to it.In this book, you'll learn about the masculine and feminine brains contribution to innovation and how feminine traits like empathy, nurturing or intuition are key to create sustainable innovation. You'll read about stories including:

How a young French chef used this feminine success formula to innovate a male-dominated industry
How starting from emotions allowed me to create successful innovation in a mundane category like shower gel
How communities of women became the solution to creating sexual toys dedicated to female pleasure.

You will love this book if you are curious about (and maybe intimidated by) innovation, and if you are interested in the masculine/feminine spectrum.Venus Genius is a non-fiction book that speaks to anybody who wants to tackle innovation under a different angle, regardless of their gender. You can be an innovator in a big company who wants to make a difference, a startup or a small business owner who doesn’t know where to start with innovation, or an HR professional who wants to retain talents by empowering and motivating them.This book is especially suited for any company (small or big) who sells products targeted to women and wants to reach them more efficiently.

<h2>Story of my Book</h2>
<p>In this book, you’ll join me in using language to render distinct aspects of Pilipino culture, history, and the Pilipino-American identity through poems like:</p>
<h3>Ferdinand Magellan</h3>
<p>Takes readers to a specific moment in elementary school where I was learning about Ferdinand Magellan and a picture of the Philippine islands and the Philippine hero, Lapu-Lapu, appears in the textbook. This was the first and only time I ever saw my culture represented in mainstream education.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was singled out in class by my teacher and classmates and was asked why “my people” “murdered” the greatest voyager in history—Ferdinand Magellan.</p>
<h3>Hirap Buhay 'Merica - Life is Hard in America</h3>
<p>Takes a look at the experiences of immigrants who have just moved to America and the unspoken struggles and realities that family and friends in the motherland don’t hear about.</p>
<p>It takes the reader to a time in my childhood where I’m running late to the bus with my Godmother and we miss it. As we watch the bus speed away, my 3-year-old self lets out a sigh and says, “Hirap buhay 'merica” or “Life is hard in America.”</p>
<h3>Halo-Halo</h3>
<p>This is a response poem to a boy who called me a ""mutt."" I use the iconic Pilipino dessert, Halo-Halo, as an overarching metaphor to describe the various cultures that the Philippines has been influenced by.</p>I love that these poems take a slice from specific moments in my childhood that are not only so familiar and nostalgic to many immigrants and BIPOC, but also teach the reader and myself lessons on Pilipino-American and Philippine history and culture.<br/> <h2>The Book: Halo-Halo</h2>
<p>The book is written into 4 Chapters:<br/><br/><strong>Chapter 1: </strong>History contains poems that pertain to the topics of Pilipino history, Pilipino-American history, or American history. I dedicate poems to iconic historical figures and poets such as Jose Rizal, Andres Bonifacio, Maria Lorena Barros, and Dr. Dawn Malabon. I also write poems about the Manongs of the Delano Grape Strike, the International Hotel, and important dates concerning the Filipino-American war, Philippine Independence, American Independence, etc.<br/><br/><strong>Chapter 2: </strong>Culture explores Pilipino community conditions such as the glorification of Eurocentric features (skin whitening, ""tall"" noses, etc.) and notable features of Pilipino culture such as the emphasis on family, faith, generosity, and unity. I celebrate and critique these parts of Pilipino culture and continue to struggle through the ongoing battle of outdated beliefs and key traditions that are essential to Pilipino culture.<br/><br/><strong>Chapter 3:</strong> Revolution and Revelation dives deep into politics. From the politics in the Philippines to the current political tensions here in the United States, and the parallels between the two. I write poetry detailing my feelings, thoughts, and perspectives about political leaders and political movements. I explore what it means to advocate and be an activist and what that means in regards to Pilipino culture.<br/><br/><strong>Chapter 4: </strong>Identity The last chapter of the book is a self-reflection after learning about my history, culture, and my passion for activism and advocacy. It begins with a childhood experience about my confusion and loss of my cultural identity. As readers go through the chapter, however, there is more clarity, resilience, and pride about my identity as a Pilipino-American.</p>

About the Author Justine Ramos is a first-generation Pilipinx immigrant and recent UCLA Alumna (C/O 2020) with degrees in English, Human Biology and Society, and Global Health. She is an aspiring occupational therapist, currently works at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and is looking forward to completing her higher degrees on the East Coast.She has performed, competed, and judged in the Slam Poetry/Spoken Word world throughout high school and college. She has been able to coach her own slam team, mentor young poets, found UCLA's only slam poetry organization, win awards with the LA Youth Poet Laureate Program and later become published with WriteGirl, Teen Ink Literary Magazine, and Cornell University's literary magazine, Rainy Day.She was inspired to write this book because she felt the need to tell the stories of her community, country, people, and family that often go untold and ignored. She hopes to share these stories to remind people that they aren’t alone in these experiences of struggle and their exploration of identity.She despises talking about herself in the third person and is an avid quarantine baker. To quote her high school teacher, she is ""intellectually engaging, fearless and fun, though occasionally snarky and unapologetically blunt."" She is an expert in having too many hobbies and has an intense obsession with One Direction and Avatar Kiyoshi from Avatar: The Last Air Bender. In her free time, she bonds with her three dogs and pesters her little brother when she is in need of attention.For more information, you can connect with Justine at halohalo.poetry@gmail.com and @halohalo.poetry or @justiney.r on Instagram. Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can Help
Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please use #HaloHaloPoetry and tag me as well as my publisher, #NewDegreePress, so we can help amplify our efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.

<h3>Book Summary</h3>
<p>It's 64 A.D. at the height of the Roman Empire. Maximus is rising through the ranks of the wealthy class when the Great Fire of Rome threatens to bring his estate – and betrothed marriage – to ruins. Emperor Nero is intent on crushing Paulus and a mysterious group called The Way. Maximus must risk everything when he embraces the faith he swore to destroy.  <i><strong>Maximus: The Quest for Greatness</strong></i> is an adventure-filled novel that brings the sweeping drama of first century Christianity to life!</p>
<p>The theme of <i><strong>Maximus </strong></i>is discovering the path to true greatness and embracing humility in the service of Christ. It explores the frailty of pagan philosophies, the power of the gospel to save sinners, and what it means to suffer for the sake of Christ.</p>

<p>Inspirados por la distribución que se hacía a principios de los 80 por las empresas clásicas del mercado español de los 8 bits, en Questron y Commodore Plus hemos decidido empezar a acercar al sur de Europa las producciones de calidad que actualmente salen al mercado para nuestro Commodore 64.</p>
<p> Protovision, empresa emblemática que lleva sacando producciones para este y otros ordenadores desde principios de siglo, lanza en breve al mercado “Sam's Journey”, una increíble aventura llena de buenos gráficos, jugabilidad y color, que nosotros no hemos dudado en traer para España e Italia.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> LA META</strong></p>
<p> La meta es alcanzar de 1100 eur para una tirada de 20 unidades, que desde Questron y Commodore Plus esperamos poder conseguir con tal de cumplir el sueño de muchos que es el de ver de nuevo una distribución autóctona de un juego de 8 bits para Commodore 64.</p>
<p> En el caso de superarse esta meta, primero, nos pondremos muy contentos, y segundo, pues se ampliará la tirada de producción hasta satisfacer a todos los mecenas que nos hayan ayudado a sacar este juego al mercado.</p>
<p> El dinero de la meta será empleado de la siguiente manera</p>
<p> · Cubrir los costes básicos de producción del cartucho, los manuales traducidos, y las cajas traducidas</p>
<p> · Pago de un % del total bruto a los creadores del juego, Knights of Bytes</p>
<p> · Pago de un % del total bruto a su productora, Protovision</p>
<p> · Sufragar los costes de más unidades físicas que se pondrán a la venta en las distintas ferias, reuniones y eventos a los que asista Commodore Plus durante el año 2017, y conseguir así que haya unidades físicas disponibles a la venta para los asistentes a las mismas. El precio de estas unidades queda sujeto a la decisión económica que tome Protovision una vez finalizado el crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Grafico </p>
<p> </p>
<p>La contribución básica con recompensa en este mecenazgo será de 55 eur, y a esto habrá que sumarle 10 eur de gastos de envío por correo certificado para recibir una copia del juego en cartucho, con su manual y caja traducidos al idioma del mecenas. Además del juego, los mecenas también recibirán junto al mismo un set de cromos en el que podremos ver los diferentes “disfraces” con los que podrá vestirse Sam durante el juego :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>La contribución para tienda es una contribución especial con un descuento para comerciantes. Con esto intentamos que el juego también esté disponible en las estanterías de las distintas tiendas que se dedican a la venta de retrovideojuegos. Si tienes una tienda y estás interesado en ayudarnos, esta es la contribución que debes hacer... pediremos datos físicos de la tienda a todos los mecenas que opten por esta opción.</p>
<p> La fecha aproximada de lanzamiento del juego será antes de que finalice el año, así que esperamos poder estar enviando las copias del juego dentro de la primera semana de Diciembre.</p>
<p> Por parte de Questron y Commodore Plus no se van a realizar tiradas en cassette o disco de este juego.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> CARACTERISTICAS DEL JUEGO</strong></p>
<p> Sam's Journey”, de Knights of Bytes, es un juego nuevo de plataformas con scroll lateral desarrollado para el Commodore 64. Trata sobre un pequeño, pero valiente héroe llamado Sam, quien se haya sin comerlo ni beberlo en una inesperada aventura en un mundo extraño y peligroso.</p>
<p> Knights of Bytes quiere que “Sam's Journey” sea tan famoso como nuestros plataformeros favoritos para la consola NES o para la Master System. Con este propósito, han implementado en el juego una serie de características que son realmente poco comunes en un juego de Commodore 64.</p>
<p> A pesar de que Sam es muy pequeño, puede correr muy rápido, y saltar muy alto ¡Es por eso que la cámara debe correr para poder seguirlo, sin importar a donde vaya!</p>
<p> Del mismo modo, Sam tiene una serie de movimientos básicos. Si bien correr y saltar son habilidades básicas y obvias, su habilidad para escalar le permiten alcanzar nuevas cotas, y gracias a su habilidad de bucear, podrá explorar las profundidades acuáticas.</p>
<p> El mundo de Sam no es solamente un arcoiris visual. Cada fase que atraviese en su aventura está acompañado por su propia música in-game, que enfatizará más si cabe la atmósfera del escenario.</p>
<p> Algunas canciones serán una melodía feliz, otras melancólicas, algunas dramáticas... y por supuesto, también habrá efectos de sonido!</p>
<p> La banda sonora al completo ofrecerá una amplia variedad de melodías que utilizarán las tres voces del SID chip del C64... puedes escuchar algunos ejemplos aquí.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RESUMEN</strong></p>
<p>· Acción clásica plataformera de 8 bits· Gráficos a todo color</p>
<p>· Scroll multidireccional· Multitud de habilidades básicas: Correr, saltar, escalar, nadar· Seis disfraces especiales que ofrecerán nuevas habilidades.</p>
<p>· 3 Mapas completos</p>

<p>· 60 mundos</p>
<p>· 2000 pantallas para explorar</p>
<p>· 19 canciones</p>
<p>· Pantallas secretas y Items ocultos</p>
<p>· Sistema de checkpoint: En el cartucho (4Mbit, 512ks) vendrá implementado un sistema de guardado de partida(2ks), que hará que esta pueda grabarse automáticamente en el cartucho.</p>

After years of turning this thought in my head, I am convinced that regardless of distinct global perceptions of beauty, the radiating inner beauty of a person is the key factor when deeming an individual as beautiful, regardless of their genetic makeup. When the opportunity to write a book came along, I decided to research this hypothesis by speaking to as many professionals in the industry all over the world in search of support. </p><p>I am passionate about how societies around the world perceive, feel and consume beauty.<br/><br/>My hope is that in reading <i>Beauty as It Is</i>, you will discover inspiring accounts and insights from 60+ elite professionals in the skincare and cosmetics industry around the world. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement I have for the success of inclusive and inside out beauty in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to position the beauty business as a means of empowerment and not a means to hide your true self. Last, but not least, I hope for people in the beauty business to learn from accounts of high-end professionals, in order to achieve prime success in today’s increasingly saturated beauty world. <br/><br/>In this book, you will learn that the future of the beauty industry is what is: honest, authentic and relatable.</p><ul>
<li>Honest: featured insights and stories from Dr. Barbara Sturm and Peter Thomas Roth, speaking about result-giving ingredients, and much more </li>
<li>Authentic: featured in accounts from Stevie Wong, through her experience working with SK II, Ira Koko, though her experiences at L'Oreal, and countless others</li>
<li>Relatable: featured in accounts from Karla Martinez de Salas, with her push for Yalitza Aparicio to be the face of Vogue Mexico's January 2019 issue, Marie Englesson, through her experience founding an African beauty company, Atsoko, and many more </li>
</ul><p><br/>You will love this book if you are interested in: re-assessing your own perception of beauty, an inside view on conversations occurring within the leading beauty industry and/or learning from <i>crème de la crème</i> beauty professionals about their personal successes and challenges to remain relevant in the industry.<br/><br/><i>Beauty as It Is </i>is a non-fiction book that speaks to two main audiences: The curious consumer and the beauty innovator, executive and marketer, who are interested in the effects of inclusive beauty and how to make beauty brands thrive in the present and times to come.<br/> </p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 30px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Book -</span><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 30px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Beauty as It Is</i></p><p>The book is written in <strong>4 Parts</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>Contains the introduction and Chapters 1-8. Here, I share my personal curiosity towards the beauty industry and the importance of the themes that will be discussed in the book. This part also dives into the definition of beauty and its perceptions, how we have gotten here, and tech and the social media component that now drives the international beauty industry.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> Contains Chapters 9-14. This part is based mainly on consumer demographics and trends the beauty industry is faced with today. Present consumers comprise of Generation Z, Millennials, Generation X, Boomers, and Silent generations, which need to be targeted accordingly and given their own voice in the beauty industry. These chapters include stories about the power of authentic beauty and feeling beautiful, no matter your gender, age, race or ethnicity. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> Contains Chapters 14-22. This part discusses the cognizance that giving societies the opportunity to feel more beautiful is only a win-win for the business and consumer. Why? because they will now purchase skincare and color cosmetics with a positive mentality to celebrate their features and not hide behind them. In these chapters, readers discover insights from professionals about the market itself and how innovation, effectiveness and integrity can ensure your business' relevance for years to come.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> Contains Chapters 23-25. This last part comes together in the form of a Handbook. All tips and recommendations are extracted from the words of experienced and successful professionals on how to achieve consumer loyalty for your a beauty brand or line. These are oriented to ensure that your brand's products and DNA is constantly making an impact in the lives of consumers regardless of the many brands being introduced in the market every day.</p><p> </p><h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

To take them from it—that is our task.Ivan Michurin About the projectThe book follows a long-term photographic project by Sputnik Photos entitled Lost Territories, which is dedicated to the former Soviet Union – territories of painful experience and unfinished transformations.  Short user manual animation explaining how the Lost Territories project works:  For several years, the photographers have documented the life and space of all the 15 countries born after the collapse of the former Soviet empire, exploring such topics as: propaganda in Georgia, veterans of the Georgian-Russian war, environment contaminated with uranium and nuclear waste, women veterans of the Great Patriotic War, borders between states, metaphysics of the dreams of former USSR citizens, long-lasting consequences of natural disasters, decline of the shipbuilding industry on the Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea, and earthquake in Spitak (Armenia). Some of this photo journeys have been supported via Indie Gogo campaign so the collaborative spirit has been present in the project in many ways.  The resultant 'Lost Territories' archive, which consists of several thousand photographs, has become a starting point for exhibitions, books, and installations. Each of the narratives to emerge in the future will address a different aspect of the post-Soviet lands. So is ‘Fruit Garden’.  More about the bookThe book‘Fruit Garden’ itself may be called a photographic field guide of sorts, albeit one that leads the viewer less to the bird than to the cage; less to the tree than to the coil of wire painfully binding its bark; less to an Arcadian landscape than to the post-Soviet landfill.  Tweezers in hand, the Fruit Garden’s archaeological dig evolves to become a meticulous survey of the doctrinal mindset underpinning Michurin’s axiom; and of the ways in which, during the reign of the Soviet Union, its repeated and obsessive society-wide implementation left, in the ideology’s wake, a razed expanse of human ecologies and psychologies, here represented by unseen tribes of damaged individuals, scarred for life by the regime’s dehumanizing regimen of invasive scientific experimentation,  The book has already been partially supported by Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage.

<p><i>The Stone Churches of Downtown Guelph Project</i> came from meeting with a group of photographers every couple of weeks for the past few years. I'd been a news photographer for about three decades and, through this group, was challenged to explore another photographic venue.<br/><br/>Downtown Guelph is home to seven churches built between 1855 and 1877, five of which are examples of Gothic Revival architecture. As I began photographing these buildings and converting the photos into black and white images, I found myself amazed at their intricacy and grandeur.</p>
<p>The more on worked on the photography, the more I realized that the legacy of these buildings needed to be preserved. Which is where your help and participation in this Indigogo campaign comes in by funding:</p>
<p>1) The publication of a table-top book which will feature black and white photos of both the churches' interiors and exteriors, and</p>
<p>2) The creation of canvas prints of some of the books photos to be used as an art exhibit (I've already had inquiries about this)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $7,000 I'm hoping to raise will cover the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design ($450)</li>
<li>Publishing, printing and promotion ($5,050)</li>
<li>Exhibit-ready canvas prints ($1,500)</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone who donates a minimum of $10 to the project will receive a 8"" x  10"" print suitable for framing. At the $25 level, 50 donors will receive an autographed copy of the book. The perks get bigger and better, with larger prints and even canvas prints being thrown into the mix. Check the perks section for more details.</p>
<p>If for some reason I don't reach the $7,000 goal, I'm hoping to raise enough to print the book or, at the very least, create the canvas prints for exhibit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>The Stone Churches of Downtown Guelph Project</i> represents both:</p>
<p>1) The city’s church history: Anglican, Presbyterian (Church of Scotland and Free Kirk), Methodist (later United and now an independent congregation), Baptist, Roman Catholic; and</p>
<p>2) The best in 19th century church architecture. Most are built in the Gothic Revival style (and some have a common architect in Toronto-based Henry Langley). Others, such as Lakeside Downtown (originally the Wesleyan Methodist church) and First Baptist are built in a simple design representative of the congregations’ beliefs at the time.</p>
<p>Downtown churches, and in some cases, church architecture are fast disappearing from the Canadian landscape. As buildings age and congregations dwindle, difficult decisions will need to be made and, as has happened elsewhere buildings are converted or razed.</p>
<p>As a journalist who has spent much of his career covering the intersection of faith and Canadian culture, this project allows me to put my three decades of writing and photographic skills to use to preserve an integral element of Guelph's past, present and, hopefully, future.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">My Pre-Sale Book Campaign</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Work is a game and this book reveals unwritten rules for getting ahead at work that you aren’t taught in school. Learn to focus your efforts where you’ll have the greatest impact while enjoying success and satisfaction you deserve. Coming out in April 2020.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<strong><i>Winning the Game of Work</i></strong> reveals valuable tips for success that I learned during my 30-year career in the corporate world. Many ambitious professionals believe that working harder is the only path to getting ahead, but that approach often leads to stress, burnout and stagnation. When you step back and can see the bigger picture using the guidance in this book, strategies emerge that allow you apply your energy and talents to areas that benefit both you and your organization that are much more impactful than simply “working hard” and hoping for the best.<br/><br/>My name is Terry McDougall and I am the author of <strong><i>Winning the Game of Work</i></strong>. I wrote this book to share insights that I found were counter-intuitive to what I thought early in my career would lead to success in the corporate world. These lessons weren’t taught in college or even in my MBA classes. I learned some through the school of hard knocks, some from wise mentors and high-dollar executive coaches, and some from my own observations about the real dynamics of the corporate world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to understand the “game of work” and be strategic about the moves you make so your efforts are impactful and lead to success for your company and for you! I love business, but I also know that it can eat you alive if you let it. I want to help you gain a new perspective on the dynamics of a successful business career so you expand your options for how to navigate and increase your confidence in the value you bring to your work.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn how to identify and overcome common beliefs that prevent you from operating at your full potential:<ul>
<li>
<strong><i>Your work speaks for itself</i> </strong>- I share 5 myths that show why this doesn’t work</li>
<li>
<i><strong>What got you here will get you there</strong> </i>- I relate a humiliating story that ultimately resulted in me doubling my salary</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Office politics is to be avoided at all costs</i></strong> - Well, only if you want to give up on having influence within your organization</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are working really hard at your job but instead of getting ahead only feel frustrated and stressed out.<br/><br/><i><strong>Winning the Game of Work</strong></i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to over-achievers and high-performers in all industries who want to enjoy the rewards and recognition that should be the result of their hard work and contributions.</p>
<h3>
<br/>The Book</h3>
<p>The book <strong><i>Winning the Game of Work</i></strong>  is written in 4 Parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapter 1.</strong> This section focuses on why it's helpful to see work as a game. If you're a striver you undoubtedly take your work seriously. This can lead to blind spots that prevent you from seeing options for your advancement. When you reframe work as a game, it frees you to be more creative. When you step back from the stressful day-to-day activities of your job, you’ll start to see the bigger picture and you can plot out your moves so that you achieve your objectives with less effort and more impact.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 2 contains Chapters 2-4.</strong> This section focuses on how getting clear on what you want from work is so critical and how so many successful people skip past this to their own detriment. In this section, I’ll also share research on the addiction that many “high-need-to-achieve” people fall into and how it actually holds them back from the career satisfaction they most desperately want.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 3 contains Chapters 5-7.</strong> In this section, you’ll begin to learn the unwritten rules of the game of work. Your perspective will shift so that you start to understand how to navigate work on a whole new level. You’ll learn to take things less personally and see how your talents can be used in a way that is valued more highly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Part 4 contains Chapters 8-10. </strong>In this section, you’ll learn to envision how you can leverage your talents to benefit your company and also to become the champion of your professional success and personal satisfaction. You’ll learn to see yourself objectively and make strategic moves that get you the outcomes that you want. The logical next steps will begin to emerge and you’ll see the playing field in a way that you never did before.</li>
</ul>

Work is a game and this book reveals unwritten rules for getting ahead at work that you aren’t taught in school. Learn to focus your efforts where you’ll have the greatest impact while enjoying success and satisfaction you deserve. Coming out in April 2020.
 
The Story of My Book
Winning the Game of Work reveals valuable tips for success that I learned during my 30-year career in the corporate world. Many ambitious professionals believe that working harder is the only path to getting ahead, but that approach often leads to stress, burnout and stagnation. When you step back and can see the bigger picture using the guidance in this book, strategies emerge that allow you apply your energy and talents to areas that benefit both you and your organization that are much more impactful than simply “working hard” and hoping for the best.My name is Terry McDougall and I am the author of Winning the Game of Work. I wrote this book to share insights that I found were counter-intuitive to what I thought early in my career would lead to success in the corporate world. These lessons weren’t taught in college or even in my MBA classes. I learned some through the school of hard knocks, some from wise mentors and high-dollar executive coaches, and some from my own observations about the real dynamics of the corporate world.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to understand the “game of work” and be strategic about the moves you make so your efforts are impactful and lead to success for your company and for you! I love business, but I also know that it can eat you alive if you let it. I want to help you gain a new perspective on the dynamics of a successful business career so you expand your options for how to navigate and increase your confidence in the value you bring to your work.In this book, you'll learn how to identify and overcome common beliefs that prevent you from operating at your full potential:

Your work speaks for itself - I share 5 myths that show why this doesn’t work

What got you here will get you there - I relate a humiliating story that ultimately resulted in me doubling my salary

Office politics is to be avoided at all costs - Well, only if you want to give up on having influence within your organization

You will love this book if you are working really hard at your job but instead of getting ahead only feel frustrated and stressed out.Winning the Game of Work is a non-fiction book that speaks to over-achievers and high-performers in all industries who want to enjoy the rewards and recognition that should be the result of their hard work and contributions.

The Book
The book Winning the Game of Work  is written in 4 Parts:


Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapter 1. This section focuses on why it's helpful to see work as a game. If you're a striver you undoubtedly take your work seriously. This can lead to blind spots that prevent you from seeing options for your advancement. When you reframe work as a game, it frees you to be more creative. When you step back from the stressful day-to-day activities of your job, you’ll start to see the bigger picture and you can plot out your moves so that you achieve your objectives with less effort and more impact.

Part 2 contains Chapters 2-4. This section focuses on how getting clear on what you want from work is so critical and how so many successful people skip past this to their own detriment. In this section, I’ll also share research on the addiction that many “high-need-to-achieve” people fall into and how it actually holds them back from the career satisfaction they most desperately want.

Part 3 contains Chapters 5-7. In this section, you’ll begin to learn the unwritten rules of the game of work. Your perspective will shift so that you start to understand how to navigate work on a whole new level. You’ll learn to take things less personally and see how your talents can be used in a way that is valued more highly.

Part 4 contains Chapters 8-10. In this section, you’ll learn to envision how you can leverage your talents to benefit your company and also to become the champion of your professional success and personal satisfaction. You’ll learn to see yourself objectively and make strategic moves that get you the outcomes that you want. The logical next steps will begin to emerge and you’ll see the playing field in a way that you never did before.

<p>Sonnets from the American (under contract with University of Iowa Press) is a new anthology that showcases the cultural and aesthetic diversity of the American sonnet. Roughly 800 years after the sonnet's invention, this project celebrates the extraordinary development of the sonnet in the hands of American poets from every corner of the aesthetic field. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601527288/nsagdrmr4babmzirylvd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;text-align: center;""><i>(A selection of recent sonnet-related titles from the Sonnets from the American Symposium's Virtual Book Fair.)</i></p>
<p>This new anthology, edited by poet and scholar team Dora Malech and Laura T. Smith, collects and foregrounds an impressive range of 20th and 21st century sonnets, including formal and formally subversive sonnets by established and emerging poets, and presents these alongside a selection of earlier American sonnets, highlighting connections across literary periods and movements. The critical essays likewise draw together diverse voices, methodologies, and historical and theoretical perspectives that represent the burgeoning field of American sonnet studies. </p>
<p>The completed anthology, which will comprise 400 pages of poems and essays, shows the form continuing to function as a poetic bellwether as centuries of poets use its peculiar confines to negotiate public and private questions of nation, race, class, gender, sexuality, diaspora, and poetic tradition--and to transform it.</p>
<p>The volume builds upon the international Sonnets from the American Symposium held October 1-3, 2020, featuring three days of academic panels, keynotes, and poetry readings with poets and scholars from seven countries. The symposium, which was entirely free and open to the public, generated enough material for many books. The anthology will feature a further curated selection of essays by Jahan Ramazani, Carl Phillips, and others from the symposium and beyond.</p>

<h3>The Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;""><em><strong>Five Little Zombies And Fred</strong></em> is a not-for-children children's book, written and illustrated to speak to the child in every one. It tells the story of our hero Fred who finds himself in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. Will he survive with the help of his friend the Mountie? It is written by Jules Sherred and illustrated by Matt Schubbe, with songs written and performed by Errol Elumir and mixed/mastered by Chris Cogott, and video by Andrew Edgar. Each person working on this project is completely in-love with the book. They are hoping to make the world fall in-love with it, too. If they can make the world fall in-love with the book, then they can turn it into a physical thing, with 42 8.5x8.5 beautifully illustrated full-colour pages, for the world to share. The final page count will be 52 pages. PLUS, a whole bunch of nifty extras and swag. More details are found below. We know the details below are OMG SO LONG and you'll be inclined to TL;DR them, but we have some REALLY AWESOMETASTIC perks planned, and they require a lot of space in order to be properly described.</span></span></span></p>

I WANT YOU TO BE A PART OF IT! I AM SO IN-LOVE WITH THIS RIDICULOUS, YET AWESOME, IDEA!” That is pretty much was happened one afternoon when, suddenly, Jules poured out the text for this book. Immediately, her mind was filled with images and she knew exactly how she wanted this story to look and feel.</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jules told Andrew about the idea, and read the book to him as she would read it to others. Immediately, Andrew fell in-love with the idea. Also, the story and image descriptions caused him to giggle like a little child.</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jules contacted an illustrator whom she admires greatly -- Matt Schubbe -- and shared with him this idea. Immediately, he, too, fell in-love with the book and wanted to be a part of it. He also shared the same vision for the project.</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jules' pal Errol saw her tweet about the project when it was referred to as [REDACTED], and wanted more information. She e-mailed him, and he, too, immediately fell in-love with it and asked if she needed any songs for the book, because he so wanted to have a part in this project filled with worlds of awesome.</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Errol needed help mixing and mastering the songs. So, Jules called on her pal Chris Cogott to see if he was willing to lend his talents to this project. Immediately, he, too, wanted to be a part of it and help out any way he could.</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Jules decided to test the waters and find out what others thought about the idea. Every one she told about it immediately fell in-love with it. Now the entire team is hoping the rest of the world falls in-love with <em><strong>Five Little Zombies And Fred</strong></em>, a not-for-children children's book that spoofs the <em>Ten Little Monkeys Jumping On A Bed </em>nursery rhyme. Not only is this book a quirky little story, it is a piece of exquisite and beautiful art, each page fully illustrated, in full-colour, crammed with wonderful Easter eggs and inside jokes, speaking directly to every geek. PLUS, ZOMBIES! Who doesn't like adorable, little, flesh-eating creatures? And we cannot forget the Mountie! And, of course, our hero Fred! Does he make it through the story alive? To find out, this project needs funding.</span></span></span></p>

It will be made available in both electronic and paperback format. It will also be made available for global distribution: such online and offline retailers and distributors such as Ingram and NACSCORP; the book will be made available through Baker &amp; Taylor to libraries and academic institutions; Amazon, and more. The songs will also be made available for the general public to purchase. We will also figure out a cost-effective way to make the posters, mugs, t-shirts and messenger bags available for all to purchase. Depending on how much we raise, we will also create other </span><em style=""font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; color: #222222;""><strong>Five Little Zombies And Fred </strong></em><span style=""font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; color: #222222;"">swag, such as stickers, magnets, hats, etc. If we double our funding goal, then we will find a developer to turn the book into an interactive book app, for both Android and iOS.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Aside from the below perks, we have other bonuses prepared. Each time we reach a 12.5% funding mark, you will see a new video, showing you 6 completed pages of the book. Upon successful funding, we will also show you the original sketches created during the idea phase, including the original rough sketches of the first two drafts, and reveal both songs. We will also show you other phases of the work-in-progress. For every extra $1000 dollars funded, one lucky contributor, to be chosen at random, will receive a bonus perk: The Travelling Zombie. If we double our funding goal, we will seek out a developer to turn the book into an interactive app for both Android and iOS.</span></span></span></p>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">So what are you funding and what you will receive:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">We need to raise $11, 500. This may seem like a large amount of money for a book, but the project included a lot of art and swag, and those things are not inexpensive to create. Specifically, the funds will be used as follows:</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">About 1/3 of this goal will go towards the printing costs of the mugs, t-shirts, device covers, posters, paperback book, personalised versions of the book; PLUS shipping to all corners of the world.</span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">About 1/3 of this goal will go to the illustrator. Even though this project is a labour of love, Jules firmly believes in compensating people for their work, at a fair price. Even at 1/3 of the funding total, that still does not cover the cost of illustrating 42 8.5x8.5 full-colour pages; PLUS 90 pieces of personalised art, ranging in sizes from 8.5x11, 12x12 (personalised copies of the book, with the contributor's name and likeness used for the hero) and 24x24 personalised cover poster. If we raise the full amount, that works out to approximately $29 for each piece of art. Really, that isn't a lot of money. Especially if you take into account little extras he is doing, such as making the art in a format usable for swag, and logo designs.</span></span></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="""">
<ul>
<li class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">The other 1/3 will be going towards a lot of miscellaneous expenses: such as IndieGoGo and PayPal fees (that comes out to approximately $1,150, more if the project is not fully-funded); giving Errol and Chris something for their time and energy for writing, mixing and mastering two songs; PLUS singing, mixing and mastering the <em><strong>Five Little Zombies And Fred </strong></em>song an additional 30 times for the personalised versions; PLUS, hopefully, having someone professionally layout the book and get it ready for print and eFormat; PLUS a little bit for Jules' writing, and time and money it costs to create the <em><strong>Five Little Zombies And Fred </strong></em>website; PLUS a few other things she is creating, like an online store and more.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><ul>
<li class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;"">The more we raise, the better those behind the project will be adequately compensated for their time and work. And if the goal is doubled, then we will be able to pay someone to develop an interactive app, both for Android and iOS.</span></li>
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">Deciding to fund this project will not only help Jules, Matt, Errol, Andrew and Chris make their dream project and labour of love a reality, but you will receive some pretty nifty perks. Originally, they had decided on 17 perks. However, IndieGogo only allows for 12 perks, so they had to consolidate some of them. The wonderful thing about IndieGoGo is that you are not bound by the perk amounts. You can contribute as little as $1 or as much as you want; PLUS add an amount on top of an existing perk. Once you click on the “Contribute Now” button, or “Claim This Perk” buttons, the instructions on how to contribute, including contributing amounts above the listed perk price, should be pretty self-explanatory. Below is a description for all 17 perks:</span></span></span></li>

And, we will make available the source tracks for the two songs so that you can remix them, if you so desire. You are also invited to write your own <em><strong>Five Little Zombies And Fred</strong></em><strong> </strong> songs!</span></span></span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p class=""western""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-family: sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: small;"">If we raise more than double our funding goal, well then we'll need to think of something even more special. Suggestions will be taken!</span></span></span></p>

</div></div>","The Short Summary
Five Little Zombies And Fred is a not-for-children children's book, written and illustrated to speak to the child in every one. It tells the story of our hero Fred who finds himself in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. Will he survive with the help of his friend the Mountie? It is written by Jules Sherred and illustrated by Matt Schubbe, with songs written and performed by Errol Elumir and mixed/mastered by Chris Cogott, and video by Andrew Edgar. Each person working on this project is completely in-love with the book. They are hoping to make the world fall in-love with it, too. If they can make the world fall in-love with the book, then they can turn it into a physical thing, with 42 8.5x8.5 beautifully illustrated full-colour pages, for the world to share. The final page count will be 52 pages. PLUS, a whole bunch of nifty extras and swag. More details are found below. We know the details below are OMG SO LONG and you'll be inclined to TL;DR them, but we have some REALLY AWESOMETASTIC perks planned, and they require a lot of space in order to be properly described.
The Longer Summary
The team behind Five Little Zombies And Fred consists of five people:

Jules Sherred is the parent of two teenage young men, and does way more than should be legal. Most notably, she is the General Manager and Programming Director of The Look 24/7, host of the Geeky Pleasures Radio Show and the offshoot website, Geeky Pleasures, and core contributor to Wired’s GeekMom. She’s already written two non-fiction books — From The Mundane To The Insane: A Wonderful Journey Without A Destination and Tales Of A Lupus Butterfly — the partial proceeds of which go to lupus research and treatment, is working on another book called Nerd Love, and is beyond excited to make Five Little Zombies And Fred a real thing for people to hold, read, and love. You can follow her on Twitter @GeekyJules. Also, SHE LOVES STAR TREK.
Matt Schubbe is a Minneapolis MN based freelance illustrator, designer, snappy dresser and man-about-town. He loves (LOVES) gaming of the tabletop and video varieties, playing the piano and Dr. Who. Now you know why he jumped at the chance to work on this project. You can follow him on Twitter @Sh00bs.
Errol Elumir is one half of the geeky, musical, comedy duo Debs & Errol. He is loud. He also creates podcasts, videos, a daily webcomic, and all manner of things that are geeky. His wife is the most patient person on the planet. You can follow him on Twitter @Elumir.
Andrew Edgar is Jules' partner in life. He doesn't like to be in the spotlight, but he enjoys supporting whatever project Jules is working on. He also loves to mess around in Adobe Premiere Pro. To that end, he has created videos for this project. You can follow him on Twitter @WileE577. 
Chris Cogott is a New Jersey based musician, singer, and songwriter. He plays and breaks guitars on a regular basis. When he turns on the recording equipment, he writes, mixes, and masters his own music and enjoys doing this for others as well. When not writing songs, he sits and watches his garden grow. You can check out his website and hear his music onBandcamp. You can also follow him on Twitter @chriscogott.


Have you ever had an idea that got you so excited, you wanted to grab every one you could, shake them, and exclaim, “I WANT YOU TO HAVE THIS! I WANT YOU TO BE A PART OF IT! I AM SO IN-LOVE WITH THIS RIDICULOUS, YET AWESOME, IDEA!” That is pretty much was happened one afternoon when, suddenly, Jules poured out the text for this book. Immediately, her mind was filled with images and she knew exactly how she wanted this story to look and feel.
Jules told Andrew about the idea, and read the book to him as she would read it to others. Immediately, Andrew fell in-love with the idea. Also, the story and image descriptions caused him to giggle like a little child.
Jules contacted an illustrator whom she admires greatly -- Matt Schubbe -- and shared with him this idea. Immediately, he, too, fell in-love with the book and wanted to be a part of it. He also shared the same vision for the project.
Jules' pal Errol saw her tweet about the project when it was referred to as [REDACTED], and wanted more information. She e-mailed him, and he, too, immediately fell in-love with it and asked if she needed any songs for the book, because he so wanted to have a part in this project filled with worlds of awesome.
Errol needed help mixing and mastering the songs. So, Jules called on her pal Chris Cogott to see if he was willing to lend his talents to this project. Immediately, he, too, wanted to be a part of it and help out any way he could.
Jules decided to test the waters and find out what others thought about the idea. Every one she told about it immediately fell in-love with it. Now the entire team is hoping the rest of the world falls in-love with Five Little Zombies And Fred, a not-for-children children's book that spoofs the Ten Little Monkeys Jumping On A Bed nursery rhyme. Not only is this book a quirky little story, it is a piece of exquisite and beautiful art, each page fully illustrated, in full-colour, crammed with wonderful Easter eggs and inside jokes, speaking directly to every geek. PLUS, ZOMBIES! Who doesn't like adorable, little, flesh-eating creatures? And we cannot forget the Mountie! And, of course, our hero Fred! Does he make it through the story alive? To find out, this project needs funding.
If this project is successfully funded, most importantly, Five Little Zombies And Fred will be available for the entire world to read and share. It will be made available in both electronic and paperback format. It will also be made available for global distribution: such online and offline retailers and distributors such as Ingram and NACSCORP; the book will be made available through Baker & Taylor to libraries and academic institutions; Amazon, and more. The songs will also be made available for the general public to purchase. We will also figure out a cost-effective way to make the posters, mugs, t-shirts and messenger bags available for all to purchase. Depending on how much we raise, we will also create other Five Little Zombies And Fred swag, such as stickers, magnets, hats, etc. If we double our funding goal, then we will find a developer to turn the book into an interactive book app, for both Android and iOS. We want to make Five Little Zombies And Fred accessible to all, with a variety of ways to enjoy the story.


What We Need & What You Get
Aside from the below perks, we have other bonuses prepared. Each time we reach a 12.5% funding mark, you will see a new video, showing you 6 completed pages of the book. Upon successful funding, we will also show you the original sketches created during the idea phase, including the original rough sketches of the first two drafts, and reveal both songs. We will also show you other phases of the work-in-progress. For every extra $1000 dollars funded, one lucky contributor, to be chosen at random, will receive a bonus perk: The Travelling Zombie. If we double our funding goal, we will seek out a developer to turn the book into an interactive app for both Android and iOS.
So what are you funding and what you will receive:


We need to raise $11, 500. This may seem like a large amount of money for a book, but the project included a lot of art and swag, and those things are not inexpensive to create. Specifically, the funds will be used as follows:


About 1/3 of this goal will go towards the printing costs of the mugs, t-shirts, device covers, posters, paperback book, personalised versions of the book; PLUS shipping to all corners of the world.


About 1/3 of this goal will go to the illustrator. Even though this project is a labour of love, Jules firmly believes in compensating people for their work, at a fair price. Even at 1/3 of the funding total, that still does not cover the cost of illustrating 42 8.5x8.5 full-colour pages; PLUS 90 pieces of personalised art, ranging in sizes from 8.5x11, 12x12 (personalised copies of the book, with the contributor's name and likeness used for the hero) and 24x24 personalised cover poster. If we raise the full amount, that works out to approximately $29 for each piece of art. Really, that isn't a lot of money. Especially if you take into account little extras he is doing, such as making the art in a format usable for swag, and logo designs.







The other 1/3 will be going towards a lot of miscellaneous expenses: such as IndieGoGo and PayPal fees (that comes out to approximately $1,150, more if the project is not fully-funded); giving Errol and Chris something for their time and energy for writing, mixing and mastering two songs; PLUS singing, mixing and mastering the Five Little Zombies And Fred song an additional 30 times for the personalised versions; PLUS, hopefully, having someone professionally layout the book and get it ready for print and eFormat; PLUS a little bit for Jules' writing, and time and money it costs to create the Five Little Zombies And Fred website; PLUS a few other things she is creating, like an online store and more.




The more we raise, the better those behind the project will be adequately compensated for their time and work. And if the goal is doubled, then we will be able to pay someone to develop an interactive app, both for Android and iOS.


Deciding to fund this project will not only help Jules, Matt, Errol, Andrew and Chris make their dream project and labour of love a reality, but you will receive some pretty nifty perks. Originally, they had decided on 17 perks. However, IndieGogo only allows for 12 perks, so they had to consolidate some of them. The wonderful thing about IndieGoGo is that you are not bound by the perk amounts. You can contribute as little as $1 or as much as you want; PLUS add an amount on top of an existing perk. Once you click on the “Contribute Now” button, or “Claim This Perk” buttons, the instructions on how to contribute, including contributing amounts above the listed perk price, should be pretty self-explanatory.

If this project is not fully funded, then the funds will be used as follows:


First, the funds will go towards IndieGoGo and PayPal fees.


Second, the funds will be used to cover the cost of manufacturing and shipping of all the perks.


Third, the funds will go towards the cost of getting the book print-ready and towards the cost of setting up large distribution.


Finally, proportionally, anything left over will go first to Matt, then Errol, then Chris, and finally to Jules to cover her out-of-pocket expenses.






The Impact
Aside from the above mentioned perks, we have some extra things planned:


Each time we reach a 12.5% funding mark, you will see a new video, showing you 6 completed pages of the book. Hopefully, the more we tease, the more people will get excited about this project and fall in-love with it, doing whatever they can to spread the word, so that more pages can be revealed.


Upon successful funding, we will also show you the original sketches created during the idea phase, including the original rough sketches of the first two drafts. We will also show you other phases of the work-in-progress. Plus, you will finally get to hear the two songs in their entirety! And, we will make available the source tracks for the two songs so that you can remix them, if you so desire. You are also invited to write your own Five Little Zombies And Fred  songs!


For every extra $1000 dollars funded, we will at random choose one lucky contributor. That contributor will receive a bonus perk: The Travelling Zombie.


If we double our funding goal, we will seek out a developer to turn the book into an interactive app for both Android and iOS. Every one who contributed more than $5 will receive the app for free.


If we raise more than double our funding goal, well then we'll need to think of something even more special. Suggestions will be taken!


The most important thing is you will helping four individuals make a dream project, one that they are completely in-love with, an actual, physical thing for people to hold and love, and hopefully fall in-love with, too! This project is created by geeks, for geeks, with a lot of special elements and details specifically for the child within all of us.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute, we fully understand! We ask that you also do the following, whether you are able to contribute or not:


Please get the word out! Tell every one you can about this project! Grab them in the streets and shake them! Well, maybe don't go that far. We don't want you facing any sort of criminal charges. Just tell every one, on all your social networks, and outside your internet spaces


Also, take advantage of the IndieGoGo share tools!


Thank you, in advance, for helping us make this dream project a reality.

Jules, Matt, Errol, Andrew, and Chris.",7.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>I've been working on and off on this project for a few years, and I've been producing more and more content based on some of my preliminary first drafts of the book.

<p><strong>LIFE DURING WARTIME: </strong><strong>A VETERAN SON’S ADDICTION*</strong>  </p>
<p> My name is Sandra Gurvis and I have been a freelance writer for over 25 years. Along with hundreds of magazine articles, I’ve had 15 books published on a wide variety of topics, from travel (DAY TRIPS FROM COLUMBUS, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed; OHIO CURIOSITIES, 2<sup>nd </sup>ed.) to business (CAREERS FOR NONCONFORMISTS) to the 1960s (WHERE HAVE ALL THE FLOWER CHILDREN GONE?). I am also the author of two novels: THE PIPE DREAMERS (Olmstead), about student protests on a college campus and COUNTRY CLUB WIVES (Loconeal), a satire on women, money, and homeless animals set in a well-to-do suburb.</p>
<p> My Indiegogo project is LIFE DURING WARTIME:  A VETERAN SON’S ADDICTION, a unique guidebook for dealing with an addict. A combination of personal experiences and factual information, it will provide a roadmap to the contradictory and terrifying world of addiction, taking the reader step-by-step through the various phases of unfolding realization so common among unsuspecting families and loved ones.  Also, if the reader is angry, frustrated, or afraid, they can look at the table of contents and find a listing that relates to the emotion they are feeling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Backstory</strong></p>
<p>In 2005, my son Alex hurt his back while on active duty in the U.S. Army and as a result, became addicted to oxycontin, and eventually heroin as well as cocaine and crack. Initially I had no clue what was going on, despite what I now realize was glaring evidence of drug abuse. At first, along with the rest of the family, I thought I could fix him. Eventually I went to Al Anon and Nar Anon meetings for support; while they helped somewhat, I still felt isolated and frustrated because there was no single written source for substantive information and emotional enlightenment.</p>
<p>Most of the available material fell into two categories: Literature from NA/AA that provided day-by-day or twelve-step anecdotal information, and technical descriptions of addiction. When I felt angry, frustrated or hopeless, I would frantically search for words or stories that could relate to what I was feeling. And while books such as CODEPENDENT NO MORE and their ilk provided some consolation they still could not fully explain what was happening so I could begin to understand addiction on a rational, in addition to an emotional, level.</p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">I conceived of LIFE DURING WARTIME in 2009, as Alex was in and out of various hospitals and ERs, courts of law, and rehab programs. He nearly lost everything – his wife, several jobs, and almost his life during his last relapse a few months ago. But nothing deterred him, not even the very real possibility of state prison (as opposed to the county jail – where he’d already spent some time) or the fact that his first cousin Josh died of an overdose in 2008. I kept thinking that if I paid for this medicine or that bill or even some groceries and cigarettes that he would get help as he’d so often promised and be cured. But it only got worse. Bad people came after him and needed to be paid off; some even showed up at my front door. I didn’t want my son to die, so I did whatever I could to save him.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Addiction is Hell</strong></p>
<p>Prescription drug abuse is rampant in the United States, among both civilians and veterans. Over the past two years, more soldiers have committed suicide than died in Iraq and Afghanistan, often because of overdose and/or inability to manage physical and mental pain. And every 19 minutes, someone in the US dies from a prescription drug overdose, triple the rate in 1990. In the state of Ohio alone, in 2010, 67 pills were dispensed for each resident, a total of over 776 million pills.  Of these, only 5 percent were dispensed legally – the majority were given free, stolen, or purchased from a friend or relative. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more people are killed from ingesting painkillers such as oxycodone than from cocaine and heroin combined.</p>
<p>Families and loved ones who are first exposed to the reality of drug abuse are understandably shocked by talk of jail, homelessness and the ICU (and worse), all of which are very real consequences. They may feel that relapses or inability to control addiction are a moral failing on their part or that of the addict. Too often they turn their backs on support groups like NA and AA because what is shared at meetings runs counterintuitive to what they instinctively want to do, which is “rescue” their loved one.</p>
<p>When I was going through this process, I found great solace in attending seminars and informational programs which were mostly geared towards healthcare providers. I began to glean a pattern, logic, and commonality of symptoms. Support groups also helped when others shared their stories, insights, and provided comfort. Yet when I was alone and wanted to read something that would hone in on a particular emotion or question, there were only general sources to turn to.  LIFE DURING WARTIME aims to bridge these gaps, combining all this information into a single, useful source.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Saving Soldiers’ Lives -- Helping Families of Addicts</strong></p>
<p>I have many contacts in the publishing industry, a platform for and extensive experience in author promotion, and a professional background in all aspects of writing, editing and book creation. I am the author of 15 other books, many of which have been successful, gone into multiple editions, and are still in print. Perhaps more importantly, I have been given an ability to write passionately and clearly about my experiences and share this knowledge with others. If more come to understand that in many ways, addiction is no different from Alzheimer’s or even heart disease, they can begin to realize that there are steps to take towards specific treatments. Although there are no easy answers, asking the right questions and achieving insight can help illuminate the way.</p>
<p>Soldiers have many more obstacles than even the average addict. I have seen Alex devolve from a confident, gregarious, and energetic young man willing to take chances to someone who basically keeps to himself. Because of his physical and mental health problems, he believes that his initial dream of becoming a police officer is over forever. While he is currently in recovery, it is day-by-day.</p>
<p>For the past several years, the US has deployed tens of thousands of soldiers to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as serve stateside. Some may or may not have been injured or may or may not even seen combat. But most of them enlisted with the ideals and hope that they would preserve freedom for this country. And what they got, when they suffered post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) or experienced any other physical or emotional pain, was oxycodene (oxycontin) and other members of the opioid family -- Fentanyl, Vicodin, as well as hydromorphines (Dilaudid) and even morphine. And in many cases that lead straight to abuse, heroin and hell.</p>
<p>Veteran’s Administrations and other treatment centers and hospitals are overwhelmed.  While they do the best they can, many times families and veterans don’t know where to turn.  They may feel overwhelmed by paperwork or not know where to go to get help and social services. If you don’t know how or where to ask the right questions, how can you get answers?  LIFE DURING WARTIME will provide resources for these issues as well. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How the Project Works</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Phase I:  Initial book proposal and sample chapters</em></strong></p>
<p>In this first phase, I am seeking funds to prepare a proposal and sample chapters of LIFE DURING WARTIME to pitch to agents and editors at the American Society of Journalists and Authors' annual conference (ASJA, <a href=""http://www.asja.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.asja.org</a>) in New York City in April 2013.  Additionally, I have received a partial two-week fellowship to work on this project.  <strong>Regardless of how much is raised, however, all monies will be put towards completion of the sample chapters, outline and table of contents so they can be submitted to editors and agents in the spring of 2013.</strong></p>
<p>Should I receive a standard book contract and advance, any leftover funds  will go towards promotion and publicity.</p>
<p><strong><em>Phase 2: Completing the project as an ebook</em></strong></p>
<p>This phase will only be implemented if the book does not receive a standard publishing contract/advance.  I will use any leftover monies from Phase I as well as seek additional funds to finish LIFE DURING WARTIME independently and publish it as an ebook. Monies will be raised to allow me time to complete the book and hire a cover designer and copy editor/proofreader, with the balance being used to promote the ebook.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>What you get </em></strong></p>
<p>Donors starting at $10 have their choice of either a free Kindle download of my novel THE PIPE DREAMERS or a download of LIFE AFTER WARTIME after it is published. I will dedicate the book to those donating the maximum of $500, in addition to speaking to their group or organization.  Those who contribute $100 will have their name or designee incorporated into the cover design.  <strong>Any and all contributors are welcome to share their stories for the book so we can come together as a community to solve this problem.</strong></p>
<p>But the intangible perks – especially for those who’ve ever loved an addict or experienced addiction firsthand – far outweigh anything that I can personally give you. Knowing that we’ve all worked towards creating a resource that can help understand and deal with addiction is the best reward.  Stopping one overdose or helping one family member or loved one is enough.</p>
<p> Thank you for considering my project.<strong> Please share via Indiegogo and elsewhere and with anyone who cares about overcoming addiction!</strong></p>

How the Project Works
Phase I:  Initial book proposal and sample chapters
In this first phase, I am seeking funds to prepare a proposal and sample chapters of LIFE DURING WARTIME to pitch to agents and editors at the American Society of Journalists and Authors' annual conference (ASJA, www.asja.org) in New York City in April 2013.  Additionally, I have received a partial two-week fellowship to work on this project.  Regardless of how much is raised, however, all monies will be put towards completion of the sample chapters, outline and table of contents so they can be submitted to editors and agents in the spring of 2013.
Should I receive a standard book contract and advance, any leftover funds  will go towards promotion and publicity.
Phase 2: Completing the project as an ebook
This phase will only be implemented if the book does not receive a standard publishing contract/advance.  I will use any leftover monies from Phase I as well as seek additional funds to finish LIFE DURING WARTIME independently and publish it as an ebook. Monies will be raised to allow me time to complete the book and hire a cover designer and copy editor/proofreader, with the balance being used to promote the ebook.
 
What you get 
Donors starting at $10 have their choice of either a free Kindle download of my novel THE PIPE DREAMERS or a download of LIFE AFTER WARTIME after it is published. I will dedicate the book to those donating the maximum of $500, in addition to speaking to their group or organization.  Those who contribute $100 will have their name or designee incorporated into the cover design.  Any and all contributors are welcome to share their stories for the book so we can come together as a community to solve this problem.
But the intangible perks – especially for those who’ve ever loved an addict or experienced addiction firsthand – far outweigh anything that I can personally give you. Knowing that we’ve all worked towards creating a resource that can help understand and deal with addiction is the best reward.  Stopping one overdose or helping one family member or loved one is enough.
 Thank you for considering my project. Please share via Indiegogo and elsewhere and with anyone who cares about overcoming addiction!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
</p>Authorâ€™s Launch is a site for writers and those who enjoy discovering the next great writer. We just need the funding to give it a push in the right direction.<br/><br/>
By bundling technology and people, we are changing the concept of a traditional book club and how writers are discovered.<br/><br/>
The first question an author hears from publishers or agents is, â€œWhatâ€™s your platform?â€ Authorâ€™s Launch was developed to create that platform. Many would think this is a great time to become an author. It isn't. <br/><span style=""font-size: 10pt;""></span><br/>But it can be. And that starts with finding good writing. <br/><br/>
The writers we select can say they were chosen, they were published and that they have had their work exposed to an audience of members from over 30 countries around the world.<br/><br/>
Writers need a place to get their work seen by a multitude of eyes, in an easy-to-find and digest format. Authorâ€™s Launch will give them that and more. We will discover talented authors through submissions, social media and good old fashioned networking and turn their work over to a community hungry for innovative and inspired writing.<br/><br/>
Each author will have tailored events, their book released and distributed, a chance to interact with a community of readers through conference calls, screen sharing/classroom technology and bulletin boards, as well as PR and marketing from social media and other sources.<br/><br/>
From the other side, readers often ask, ""How did these people get a book deal?""<br/><br/>
We are empowering readers in over two dozen nations to answer that question: ""Because I helped them get started.""<br/><br/>
Members can interact directly with authors about their work. Regardless of your schedule or location, you will be able to speak with and contact other members to share your views as part of the membership.<br/><br/>
We plan to release 24 ebooks in the first year (two per month).<br/><br/>
In these times of a tough economies around the world, we have also reached out to libraries in test markets to allow the books and the site to live organically across the United States and, in a sense, get independent writers on the bookshelves of libraries.<p><br/></p>
</div><div style=""font-family: arial;"">
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>Our plan is to connect authors and readers throughout the world in a unique blend of online and real-world applications, including on-site events, simulcast library meetings, authorsâ€™ readings in independent bookstores broadcast over the web, and more. We want to take the local and make it universalâ€”an idea integral to the writing process itself.<br/><br/>
As you help us make this successful, we will show that people can help determine what is good in the marketplace--and not what the marketplace wants people to think is good. We can directly formulate and shape the next generation of great authors.<p><br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
