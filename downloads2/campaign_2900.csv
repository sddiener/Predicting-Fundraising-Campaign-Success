</p><p></p><h1>""Italië walgt van barbaren""</h1>Laat zien dat Nederland meeleeft met Italië door geld in te zamelen voor het
herstel van de Barcaccia-fontein. Wij zijn geen barbaren!

<p>Kunsthistorici van de gemeente Rome hebben vrijdagochtend de
Barcaccia-fontein op de Piazza di Spagna onderzocht, waar Feyenoord-supporters
donderdag hebben huisgehouden. De experts hebben „permanente beschadigingen”
vastgesteld. Er ontbreken stukjes van de marmeren beelden. De deskundigen
reppen over een „verkrachting” van het meesterwerk van Bernini</p>
<p>„De hooligans hebben zelfs op de kostbare marmer geürineerd”, aldus de
Corriere<br/>
<br/>
De fontein was pas enkele maanden geleden wit en schoon opgeleverd na een
restauratie van 2 ton. Persbureau ANSA noemt de fontein een „juweel”. Paus
Urbanus VIII gaf de Fontana della Barcaccia (Fontein van de slechte boot) in 1627
in opdracht. Het motief zou zijn geïnspireerd door een schip dat tijdens de
overstroming van de Tiber in 1598 op de Piazza di Spagna strandde. Het schip in
de fontein lijkt inderdaad te zinken. Het is de eerste fontein in de
kunstgeschiedenis die in zijn geheel als beeldhouwwerk is uitgevoerd. Eerder
hadden fonteinen geometrische vormen.</p>

Barcaccia-fontein op de Piazza di Spagna onderzocht, waar Feyenoord-supporters
donderdag hebben huisgehouden. De experts hebben „permanente beschadigingen”
vastgesteld. Er ontbreken stukjes van de marmeren beelden. De deskundigen
reppen over een „verkrachting” van het meesterwerk van Bernini
„De hooligans hebben zelfs op de kostbare marmer geürineerd”, aldus de
Corriere

De fontein was pas enkele maanden geleden wit en schoon opgeleverd na een
restauratie van 2 ton. Persbureau ANSA noemt de fontein een „juweel”. Paus
Urbanus VIII gaf de Fontana della Barcaccia (Fontein van de slechte boot) in 1627
in opdracht. Het motief zou zijn geïnspireerd door een schip dat tijdens de
overstroming van de Tiber in 1598 op de Piazza di Spagna strandde. Het schip in
de fontein lijkt inderdaad te zinken. Het is de eerste fontein in de
kunstgeschiedenis die in zijn geheel als beeldhouwwerk is uitgevoerd. Eerder
hadden fonteinen geometrische vormen.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Pavena Srelaphan, I am a freelance illustrator from Thailand Bangkok, I use name maomee_sammy on social media such as instagram and facebook. During the past several years, I create artwork for Thai publishing and local business companies.<br/><br/>I primarily create art with pigment ink pen in style of line, dot and shadow. Sometimes, I also use watercolor or Photoshop to illustrate the drawing in colors. Natural plants, wild animals and patterns are the objects very often I like to use in my drawings, I also focus on details of the little critters. When I am drawing, I have passion for showing my feeling and thinking in a beatiful way.<br/> <br/>Over years, my passion and learning make me grow up. Now, I would like to take this chance to present my first art book ""A Journey in Drawing of Nature and Creatures"". In this book, it includes drawings from my own, most of them are in black and white pen drawing style, only fews are in colors that I did with Photoshop. I want people to know my book, my art and even my mind, your admiration is my passion to go on in further.<br/><br/>I would like to say thank you so much for your support to make this book come true. If you have any suggestion or question, or be willing to know me, you can contact me by email ""maomaewmee@gmail.com"", or my instagram ""@maomee_sammy"", I would be very happy and willing to answer back to you.</p>

It will explain the goals you will need to achieve along each part of the process so that you ensure you remain focused on solving the problems for which the product was originally intended as well as put you in a position whereby you will be taken seriously by prototype and final production manufacturers, venture capitalists, patent attorneys and all others in the world you are going to meet along the path of bringing your creation to life.

In a nutshell, this is an ""engineering"" book for the everyday man and woman and one that may just be the difference to your product being a success or not.",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/_anastasia.menshikova_/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">we</a> are:</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We are a married creative couple who both received our Arts degrees from the Arts and Culture College of Pskov, (where we met!), in 2008. But I graduated from the Faculty of Decorative and Applied Art, and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/brownblacknwhite/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my husband</a> - the Faculty of Directing Theatrical Performances.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Since graduation, we gave birth to our beautiful son (photo with deer), and moved to the countryside, where we live now. <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/_anastasia.menshikova_/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I am</a> fond of creating traditional Slavic folk dolls and teaching others about it, and my husband (he chose another craft!) invents amazing wood interior items.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Over the past year and a half, we have received a lot of e-mails from people who would like to learn how to make folk dolls and to prepare medicinal herbs properly. All these people were ready to come to us right now and attend several master classes, and just to stay here for a while.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">There are very beautiful places (our river):</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">But we had to refuse them.. And we still refuse, because now they have nowhere to come. We have neither a comfortable workshop, nor a room for master classes, nor a just small house where we could accommodate guests. But we want these people to come to us so much!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And here's what we came up with:</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What we are doing:</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our campaign is to raise money to create a place in which everyone will get the opportunity to learn and practice art. With the money we raise, we will be able to build and organize universal living space that will combine the hostel, family workshop and camping at the same time! </strong></p>

Who we are:
We are a married creative couple who both received our Arts degrees from the Arts and Culture College of Pskov, (where we met!), in 2008. But I graduated from the Faculty of Decorative and Applied Art, and my husband - the Faculty of Directing Theatrical Performances.
Since graduation, we gave birth to our beautiful son (photo with deer), and moved to the countryside, where we live now. I am fond of creating traditional Slavic folk dolls and teaching others about it, and my husband (he chose another craft!) invents amazing wood interior items.
Over the past year and a half, we have received a lot of e-mails from people who would like to learn how to make folk dolls and to prepare medicinal herbs properly. All these people were ready to come to us right now and attend several master classes, and just to stay here for a while.
There are very beautiful places (our river):

Pushkin Museum:

But we had to refuse them.. And we still refuse, because now they have nowhere to come. We have neither a comfortable workshop, nor a room for master classes, nor a just small house where we could accommodate guests. But we want these people to come to us so much!
And here's what we came up with:
 
What we are doing:
Our campaign is to raise money to create a place in which everyone will get the opportunity to learn and practice art. With the money we raise, we will be able to build and organize universal living space that will combine the hostel, family workshop and camping at the same time!

How we will use the campaign money to build out the basics!
(We don't want to waste your money, so my husband will do all the construction work on his own. He already has a similar experience, and I fully trust him in that work).

5. You will get cool stuff! (Who doesn’t love that?)
6. You will have our undying gratitude!

The success of this campaign will help to realize our longstanding dream - every day to change our lives and the lives of others for the better! By close friendly communication, exchange of experience and joint creativity!
 

Risks & Challenges
We are not afraid of any risks or challenges associated with the planning and construction of our space. Fortunately, my husband Igor has a good experience of such work. I can totally rely on him. We know that difficulties are inevitable, but we can do anything!
If the campaign is successful, we will be able to invite everyone on December 1, 2019. Maybe even earlier.

<h3>About us </h3>
<p>Our fundraising campaign is being led by three individuals: Koby, Georgia and Tom. </p>
<p>Koby is a hardworking and passionate illustrator, and he works primarily within textiles, toy making, print work and character illustrations. </p>
<p>Georgia is a dedicated and ambitious illustrator. Her work usually demonstrates character design, concept illustration, visual development or graphics for products. </p>
<p>Tom is heavily inspired by our shared histories and cultures, working primarily within children's illustration to encourage engagement with historical content. His work is gestural and figurative. </p>
<p>The rest of our team demonstrate an even broader selection of skills and talents, displaying a variety of unique approaches to the concept of illustration, and include:</p>

<p>And we need your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to continue manually fundraising, so we are hoping to raise half our total remaining goal via this platform - £600. 100% of money funded will go towards helping prepare the event to be the absolute best it can be!</p>
<p>To give something back, if you donate <strong>£25 or more, you get a 'Lucky Dip' print! </strong>Each print will be hand prepared by one of our talented illustrators, and sent to you as a thank you for your support.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, all of the funds will go to supporting the event, which we will still try our best to attend no matter the outcome.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have endeavoured to use this as an opportunity to aid the community, working closely with local businesses, such as the One Eyed Dog and the Round Tower, hosting markets and other artistic events to help encourage footfall. </p>

With this project being produced you and your friends will be able to grab a small physical charm that shows off your favorite character! You could even gather your money together to split a 12 set if you wished!

If you still want to help out but can't afford to donate to the cause feel free to reblog and share!
If some how the highest tier is doubled that will cover the production costs again so I will buy an extra 50 charms of each character to be sold!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm from the south and understand that many people flying the ""Stars and Bars"" are just good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm. However, it gets a little confusing to distinguish who's just showing southern pride, and who's a hate mongering bigot, since this symbol has historical connotations of oppression and is often used by hate groups.</p><p>So I've found a solution! Show your southern pride without being mistaken as a bigot with one of many colorful bumper stickers or T-shirts. Don't just support the ""Stars and Bars"" as the flag is often referred to, show your support for Stars and Gay Bars! What better way to take away a symbol's power of hate and oppression than by combining it with a symbol of love and equality? So go ahead, show off your southern gay pride. Whether you're LGBTQ or straight, choose from one of many designs to show your support!</p><p></p><h4>What is the money for?</h4>I will be donating 20% of the net proceeds to a national LGBTQ non-profit organization working for equal rights. Despite the recent legislature, there is still a long way to go. The rest will go towards supporting my own artistic endeavors. While not my regular job, I'm an artist at heart. I would like to continue to pursue my artistic passion, but need resources to do so. Funds raised will help me continue to pay for the things I need to accomplish my creative goals for many other projects.<div>
<br/><h4>Seriously...WTF?</h4>
<p>The goal of this artistic project is to make people think about how we use symbols in society and how they can affect the feelings of others. I see this as promoting equality while demoting a symbol of bigotry. I expect there will be a variety of reactions and other opinions due to the controversial nature of the topics. Ultimately, this is satire, so try not to take it too seriously.</p>

</div></div>","Contribute today to show your support of LGBTQ and equality for all!Promote equality while satirically demoting a symbol of bigotry. I'm from the south and understand that many people flying the ""Stars and Bars"" are just good ol' boys, never meanin' no harm. However, it gets a little confusing to distinguish who's just showing southern pride, and who's a hate mongering bigot, since this symbol has historical connotations of oppression and is often used by hate groups.So I've found a solution! Show your southern pride without being mistaken as a bigot with one of many colorful bumper stickers or T-shirts. Don't just support the ""Stars and Bars"" as the flag is often referred to, show your support for Stars and Gay Bars! What better way to take away a symbol's power of hate and oppression than by combining it with a symbol of love and equality? So go ahead, show off your southern gay pride. Whether you're LGBTQ or straight, choose from one of many designs to show your support!What is the money for?I will be donating 20% of the net proceeds to a national LGBTQ non-profit organization working for equal rights. Despite the recent legislature, there is still a long way to go. The rest will go towards supporting my own artistic endeavors. While not my regular job, I'm an artist at heart. I would like to continue to pursue my artistic passion, but need resources to do so. Funds raised will help me continue to pay for the things I need to accomplish my creative goals for many other projects.
Seriously...WTF?
The goal of this artistic project is to make people think about how we use symbols in society and how they can affect the feelings of others. I see this as promoting equality while demoting a symbol of bigotry. I expect there will be a variety of reactions and other opinions due to the controversial nature of the topics. Ultimately, this is satire, so try not to take it too seriously.
I have several perks available to those who donate to my campaign. All stickers are durable weatherproof vinyl *not shown to scale* T-shirts are 100% preshrunk cotton. See more FAQs and Risks and Challenges at the bottom of this page.

You get a virtual high five for a $1 donation!

For a $2 donation you get a high resolution download of ALL the designs for personal use. Print as many as you like yourself! Hand them out at rallies! Make some T-shirts!

For a $3 donation get a 4"" x 2.5"" Stars and Gay Bars flag sticker!





For a $4 donation get a Stars and Gay Bars 7.5"" x 3.75"" sticker!




For a $5 donation choose any one of the 4"" x 4"" sticker designs!(or get all three for $12)




Gay Rebel 11.5"" x 3"" sticker for a $6 donation!

Southern Gay Pride 11.5"" x 3"" sticker for a $6 donation!


Get both 11.5"" x 3"" stickers for a $10 donation!

Get one of each sticker for a $25 donation! That's a total of 7 stickers!

$20 gets you a Southern Gay Pride T-Shirt!



$20 gets you a Gay Rebel T-Shirt!





Risks and Challenges. 
This is my first ever crowd funding campaign, so it's a new experience. The designs are already completed, and I have previous experience working with printing companies, so I don't expect any delays on my end. There is always the possibility of the print company running into delays. I never rule out the chance of a zombie virus outbreak delaying any project I am working on either. 
FAQs
Which charity will a portion of the net proceeds be going to?
To prevent any misconceptions of my fundraising campaign being affiliated with or sponsored by the LGBTQ non-profit organization that will receive the donation of 20% of the net proceeds, I will not mention the name in this campaign unless I have their explicit permission to do so, which at the moment I do not have.

Why shouldn't I just donate directly to a LGBT charity myself?
You should. However, you should also donate to my campaign so you can support my art and get one of my fabulous perks! It's winning for everybody.
What other creative projects are you working on?
At the moment, I hope to create another crowdfunding campaign concerning history and education. As I have found out, to get to the point of trying to raise funds, takes funds. If this project is successfully funded, I will use a portion of the proceeds to help start and promote my next crowdfunding campaign on education.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>Hey! I've been an illustrator for quite some time. I am studying in the graphic design field and hope to further my skills throughout my time studying and outside of school. I really enjoy exploring other mediums so this project is me doing just that, all by myself!</p>
<p>What are you planning to make?</p>
<p>I am planning to make my very first enamel pin!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where did this project come from?'</p>
<p>over the past 3 years, I have become a member of the hamster community and I see how much love and appreciation goes into these animals that need all the love and don't normally get it. that is why I want to make my first pin something I care about and for a community that deserves something nice for all the hard work they do.</p>
<p>What’s your plan, and what’s your schedule?</p>
<p>I have been discussing manufacturing costs with many companies and have been doing research figuring out my beat options. pin making is expensive so you want to make sure to get the best result possible. so once I get enough pre-orders through this kickstarter I will give the go-ahead and begin my order. the creating process may take a month or so with delivery but once done ill be shipping immediately.</p>
<p>What’s your budget?</p>
<p>Material: iron</p>
<p>Size: 1.25""</p>
<p>Process: hard enamel</p>
<p>Plating: silver</p>

</div></div>","Who are you?
Hey! I've been an illustrator for quite some time. I am studying in the graphic design field and hope to further my skills throughout my time studying and outside of school. I really enjoy exploring other mediums so this project is me doing just that, all by myself!
What are you planning to make?
I am planning to make my very first enamel pin!
 
Where did this project come from?'
over the past 3 years, I have become a member of the hamster community and I see how much love and appreciation goes into these animals that need all the love and don't normally get it. that is why I want to make my first pin something I care about and for a community that deserves something nice for all the hard work they do.
What’s your plan, and what’s your schedule?
I have been discussing manufacturing costs with many companies and have been doing research figuring out my beat options. pin making is expensive so you want to make sure to get the best result possible. so once I get enough pre-orders through this kickstarter I will give the go-ahead and begin my order. the creating process may take a month or so with delivery but once done ill be shipping immediately.
What’s your budget?
Material: iron
Size: 1.25""
Process: hard enamel
Plating: silver
Attachment: a black rubber clutch
Unit price: $0.5
Mold fee：$40
Shipping fee: $24
total: $69 I would like to reach for a bit higher as the more pins made, the cheaper the cost. so I will be reaching for $130

<h2>Our 30-foot American Bison is coming back to roam the playa at Burning Man 2019, but first it needs some love...</h2>
<p>Starting in 2015, a group of friends got together to bring a ridiculous idea to life. We wanted to create an audio-visual experience for the playa and beyond that sparks conversation about the American bison's complicated past, present, and future.</p>
<p>Three years in, and countless hours and sore muscles later, we've accomplished a lot. Kindred Spirit is visually stunning, with a brown fur base meant to mimic the real animal by day and a custom geometric color-changing LED overlay that glows by night. Our sound-stage hosts artist, live musician, and DJ performances, and features an upper deck to dance and lounge on! Our art car provides a lens through which we can explore the majestic mammal that's an intrinsic part of our collective history.</p>
<p>This is in no small part thanks to your generous contributions from 2016 and 2017. Thank you!</p>

<h3>So, our mutant bison is sitting on a ranch...</h3>
<p><strong>...and it won't start.</strong></p>
<p>Since 2015, Kindred Spirit has called New York, New Jersey, Oregon, and California ""home."" In 2018, KS made a voyage to its new permanent home in Nevada. The trip was a little bumpy to say the least.</p>
<p>Our truck broke down on the highway, and we had to get it towed the rest of the way. Thankfully this didn't happen far from our final destination so the cost was not exorbitant. Upon arrival, a mechanic took a look under the hood and revealed several issues that need to be addressed before Kindred Spirit can safely get back on the road (or, for that matter, even start again). We need your help to fund this work and to get ready for another amazing season!</p>

<p>Vehicle Maintenance - Kindred Spirit's may need a total overhaul under the hood.

It's possible we'll need to replace the entire engine. We may also need to install new batteries &amp; cabling, and get an oil change. Parts and labor all taken into account, we expect this to cost between $2,000-$3,000.</p>

<h3>Kindred Spirit's Impact...</h3>
<p>We hope our time on the playa puts smiles on your faces and that we'll watch the sunrise on our upper deck together while jamming to some awesome music. In the future, our goal is to become a stage for historians, environmentalists, conservationists, and other groups and organizations who are passionate about the bison and seek to spread knowledge and awareness. Of course, we'll also be organizing music-focused get-togethers so we can dance and make new memories outside of Black Rock City.</p>

Června 2020, stanovena nová omezení pro venkovní akce v České republice.</p><p>Nízká účast na festivalu, což znamená menší příjem ze vstupu a příjem z prodeje jídla / pití a nedostatek prostředků potřebných k platbě za služby (jeviště, zvuk, doprava, hudebníci).</p><p> </p><h3>Dodatečné informace </h3><p>Nezisková organizace Bez iluze Deziluze z.s.  organizuje v uplynulých letech festival kombinovaným financováním od veřejných a soukromých dárců a vlastním provozováním stánků s potravinami a nápoji. K financování přispívá i tzv.

Tyto festivaly jsou prostory, kde si mladí lidé užívají alternativní kapely z celé ČR a vyjadřují se v prostředí „svobody“.Festival Deziluze 2020Deziluze je neziskový festival vytvořený před 7 lety skupinou mladých sociálních aktivistů, kterou vede Mariannka Cimburová. Byl tak vytvořen  prostor pro propagaci nových umělců na české scéně ve spojení amatérských kapel, divadel, spisovatelů a básníků, filmařů, fotografů, akrobatů, sportovců a tanečníků. Mariannka Cimburová, Spoluakladatelka festivalu Deziluzehttps://www.facebook.com/marianna.cimburovaPro 2020 bylo rozhodnuto oživit pivovar „Herold“ v Březnici. Dochází tak k přizpůsobení tohoto místa pro instalace umělců, koncertů, divadla, blešího trhu a dalších aktivit! Kombinace barokního pivovaru, kultury, kreativity a veselí nezbytně upoutá smysly návštěvníků.Spolu s českým inovačním mechanismem myELEN.com hledá Deziluze podporu pro umělce a organizační tým. Shromážděné dary budou použity na nákup materiálů, které umělci použijí pro své instalace a na scénografii prostoru.Cílem je podpořit talent těchto nových umělců jako způsob zhodnocení jejich práce.Jaké jsou cíle?Udržet naživu projekt, který podporuje práci mladých umělců a pomáhá jim při rozvoji jejich talentu.Nápoje zdarma!Čili habanero shot!!Vstup ZDARMA na festival! Pořadatelé Deziluze poskytnou s vašimi dary, materiály potřebné k instalaci inovativních výstav, jako jsou instalatérské umění, techno chrám, obrazy a dalšíBenefity spojené s dary jsou:50 Kč = doplňkový nápoj100 Kč = Chilli habanero200 Kč = vstup ZDARMA DopadŽijeme ve světě, kde je kultura podceňována. Svým darem podpoříte talent nové generace umělců v České republice.

V případě, že by bylo zjištěno riziko šíření nákazy, nebo pokud by byla v České republice k datu události, 26. – 27. Června 2020, stanovena nová omezení pro venkovní akce v České republice.Nízká účast na festivalu, což znamená menší příjem ze vstupu a příjem z prodeje jídla / pití a nedostatek prostředků potřebných k platbě za služby (jeviště, zvuk, doprava, hudebníci). Dodatečné informace Nezisková organizace Bez iluze Deziluze z.s.  organizuje v uplynulých letech festival kombinovaným financováním od veřejných a soukromých dárců a vlastním provozováním stánků s potravinami a nápoji. K financování přispívá i tzv. Deziluzní blešák, kterým organizátoři zároveň upozorňují na problém nadměrné konzumace zboží a podporuje tak recyklaci.Rozpočet se řeší s co nejnižšími náklady, organizační tým a umělci pracují jako dobrovolníci, kapely (až na pár výjimek) hrají za „cestovné“. Rozpočet je tak použit zejména na služby dopravy, pódia, úpravy pivovaru, instalace toalet / sprch / stanů atd.Pro náš letošní event se přizpůsobují nevyužité budovy pivovaru Herold a bez finanční odměny se odváží tuny odpadu, stejně tak se zajišťuje bezpečnost v budovách. Náš festival vdechuje budovám nový život. Doufáme, že Deziluze bude moct využít pivovar k dalším událostem v budoucnu.Festival FB fan page: https://www.facebook.com/festivaldeziluze/FB event: https://www.facebook.com/events/2616054565117137/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/festival.deziluze/Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx2NhwUn99PkCu_____________________________________________________________________________________(English version)Short SummarySummer music festivals in the Czech Republic are a ‘must to do' if you want to live a deeper cultural experience in the heart of Europe.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Radoslav, but you may call me Rade or Rasha.</p>
<p>I'm an artist... no, I'm an office worker...  well,  both are true.</p>
<p>For the last 20 years or so, I've been practicing various forms of art. Mostly visual arts, performances, objects and installations, but not limited to that. During the period, I published more than 12 e_books in my native language and English, fiction prose and poetry. I've been creating a lot of web content, humorous mostly, for my friends worldwide.</p>
<p>Also, for the last 20 years or so, I've been an office worker. First at different positions and, after graduating as a Bachelor with honors in Economy, ten years as the Chief accountant in public elementary school. This was needed, since art pays next to nothing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though Economy pays better, it takes a lot of my time and energy. It was almost impossible for me to engage in art as much as I needed, in fact, it almost drove me to stop creating art altogether. So I've put my education to good use, taking myself as a subject, and found a way to combine work with pleasure. With this campaign, I'm trying to raise enough money to buy equipment, machines and materials needed to form a small family art shop, dedicated to creation of unique designs, furniture, jewelry and pretty much anything that can be considered artistic. Did I mention I'm a member of Art society of my country? Well, if you decide to look me up, a good point to start is to use ""Radoslav B. Chugaly"" in your preferred search engine, I promise it will not be boring or hard.</p>
<p>I have no larger goal in my life than this, to be free to create and share ideas, objects and practices with others. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I do need is fairly simple and straightforward. I've done my homework, as I mentioned, collecting info about my potential market and resources - there is a definite space for my small business, specially since it offers unique outcomes.</p>
<p>I've checked the prices of machines and resources I need, took in consideration the amount of tax I will probably have to pay for the money received through this campaign and came up with the rounded figure of 10.000 US$. Of course, if I don't reach that amount, I'll still be able to start this art shop, only in smaller size and a little bit more time will be needed to reach the final stage. No matter, I'm not quitting with this idea, this shop will exist in real world as it now exists in my imagination.</p>
<p>For the backers (that's you, of course) I've prepared creative and interesting perks. Most of them rely on my artistic skills and talents, but there are also a few surprises in store. All the perks will be personalized, all of them handmade, and I promise they will be unique.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Focus of my future work will be on wood. Salvaged wood, re-purposed wood and new one. There are designs already prepared for the table lamps, coffee tables and serving trays. Some of the objects will use epoxy resin, but also other materials. What I wish to emphasize here is that the plan is to use as much recycling and re-purposing as possible, especially with such a precious commodity as wood is. Also, my design plans include the idea of not using metal screws or bolts combined with wood, while maintaining the proposed furniture available for some easy assembly by the buyer - I wish people to take part in creative act, it gives more pleasure to a person. </p>
<p>This way, except making artistic and unique objects to my satisfaction, I hope to take small part in making the world a better place by salvaging and recycling waste to a new value. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The greatest risk involved with this campaign is not to be funded, of course, but the most important ones are regarding my personal health and abilities to produce and market profitable items, while staying an artist and not loose focus of handmade products.</p>
<p>I am in excellent health, that is something of a pride for me, and I hope to stay so. As for the rest, I am more than qualified having graduated with majors in business and services, and being worldly recognized at both visual and written art. Of course, I do not sleep on the job, constant learning and research are a must.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't assist this campaign through financial support, I'll be just as happy to ask you for sharing the info about it. Sometimes this can help even more, and to me this means a lot.</p>

<h2><strong>NFT is the Future of the Digital Era and this has become a trend all over the world</strong></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630417286/gqpbpa5dtubn80nb8q4y.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Andy Tan and I like arts and new technology.</p>
<p>At the point when I found out about cryptocurrency and NFTs,<br/>I realized that this was the biggest change and opportunity in our life.<br/>I wanted to participate in this new game and bring along all my supporters.<br/>NFTs,Cryptos and Blockchain are going to change the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is an NFT?</h3>

<p>My name is Brian Charles. You may be asking, “Brian, just who do you think you are?” Well, I’m originally from a small town in Iowa, grew up in your average family- one sister, mom, dad, dog, cat. But the year of my 21st birthday that all changed and it changed dramatically. My father got sick and passed away due to pancreatic cancer. So now what? My thoughts exactly. My whole world shifted, so I decided to shift with it.</p> <p>I packed up my Honda Civic and drove West to California, where I knew exactly one person. After six (mostly blurred) years, I moved back home. Another year passed before I decided to hit the road for Mississippi, where I met the love of my life. We had plans to wed in May of 2020, but you know how 2020 went… Since my split I’ve found the courage to put myself out there. I had been tattooing only a short time before I realized I had finally found my passion, and when you find your passion nothing can stop you.</p> <p>My story has made me a teacher, someone who has the ability to get through to people. Having learned this about myself, I’ve made it my mission to educate society a little bit more about tattoos and what they truly mean for an individual. I will help get the message out there that tattoos have been around for decades and will continue to be around much longer than you or I. Tattoos and booze will never lose! Neither is going anywhere any time soon. </p> <p>What we put on our bodies is no indicator of our potential, but rather an expression of our being, a record of our journey. I want to help break the stigma one community at a time, and no better place to start than beautiful, culture rich Biloxi, Mississippi- the place I now call home. </p> <p>Electric Envy Tattoo Spa will be different from the traditional shop that many see as intimidating or rough around the edges. The concept of a SPA, (that’s right, a spa) where you can get a tattoo, a massage, a facial, semi-permanent makeup, and more, is a game changer. Your art, your journey, should be memorable and uniquely yours. You deserve a peaceful zen experience as you engage in your unique art expression.</p> <p>We will offer many amazing services for the creative and expressive residents of, and visitors to, beautiful Biloxi. Working with the youth of the community, we will create an after-school type program for teens and young adults. We will introduce different styles of art and teach our new friends how to become effective entrepreneurs, get their voices heard, and follow their own passions to never be without. </p> <p>One thing I’ve learned from my own journey and circumstances is that a person’s future is their own. The nurturing we offer the youth of our communities is instrumental in the development of the toolboxes of their futures. Teaching them early that they are accepted, and acceptable, can be the single turn that leads them in a healthy direction, regardless of what life may throw in their paths. Art and business leadership are two incredible tools that can keep them going through any obstacles they may face.</p> <p>First and foremost, this funding will help secure our ideal location in the heart of the community. We will also begin efforts to mobilize our services for a personalized and secure environment to serve those who cannot, or do not wish to travel into public environments, especially during these unsure times. We will be capable of scheduling a private visit to your home or other preferred location (or event), to apply your tattoo safely and professionally.</p> <p>Additionally, the donations we receive through this effort will go towards things such as art and office supplies, decor, lighting, and improvements to our location for a relaxing and safe environment. We will be able to bring in local educators and host stunning events and displays to help grow and showcase our new family and our work. </p> <p>And we will have the opportunity to enact a great business and marketing model that will ensure lasting roots for the community. I've never been about the almighty dollar and money has never ruled my life. I have always been the person who will give away everything if only it meant the comfort and care of someone else.</p> <p>So, after some deep encouragement from people who have faith in me and this idea, I decided to create this fundraiser and these rewards to help make this dream a reality for us all. The perks in place for those who contribute here, and become part of the foundation for this movement, are designed to give back. The landlord doesn't take rent in tattoos, but if you're willing to invest in me, I will give back with even greater value, and you have my guarantee on that.</p> <p>Many talented local artists are eager to be part of this innovative project. While much of my journey so far has been a struggle, it has put me in a unique position to take those experiences that have shaped me, and offer knowledge to others. By creating this place for artists and creatives of all kinds to feel at home, we will also teach all who doubt us, or themselves, that anything is possible when you follow your passions to create your path. We can demonstrate that a tattoo is an expression, not a scarlet letter. Art is soul, not destruction.</p> <p>I have walked back from the very edge and want to make sure no one ever feels like that is a place they want to go. Having learned a healthier, inspiring way to live, I want to lead by example and help this great community find the same outlets and optimism that I continue to nurture within myself.</p> <p>We are passionate, talented, and bold, and we are here to make some noise. With a little help from you, our lovely new friends, noise is what we shall make! We will spread Electric Envy far and wide so that everyone has the chance to understand that their dreams are worthy and always as close as their determination. </p> <p>You who have given your time to read this, share it with your friends, or are able and willing to invest a hard earned dollar, you are precious and important to me and will never be forgotten. I look forward to seeing you in the spa! Until then, always stand firm in your drive and passions, believe in YOU, never slow down, and don’t forget to live loudly. May God bless you.

<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">[ENGLISH TEXT]</span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">People in wheelchairs,
people walking with clutches, elderly people, families with strollers, etc. It
is estimated that the lack of accessibility affects <a href=""http://ici.radio-canada.ca/sujet/Elections-Montreal-2013/2013/10/24/006-debat-personnes-mobilite-reduite-montreal.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>at least 600,000 Montrealers</b></a>. Yet, there is no law to provide a framework to universal
accessibility in Quebec, and many businesses and public places still keep their
doors closed to a whole part of the population.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Produced by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PortraitsDeMontreal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Portraits of Montréal</a> with the help of Kéven Breton, supporter of universal accessibility,
AT THE DOOR aims to raise awareness on the impacts of our city’s lack of accessibility
in the lives of many citizens, with or without limited mobility.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>WHAT IS AT THE DOOR?</b></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When the metro was
built, it was meant to allow Montreal to enter the age of modernity. Today,
<b>only 8 stations out of 68</b> – all on the orange line – are accessible to all. As
a symbol we chose this public transportation system to illustrate the lack of
accessibility in Montreal and in Québec. Therefore, 68 different people were
photographed in front of the 68 metro stations, and shared 68 everyday life
anecdotes, authentic stories all linked by the issue of inaccessibility.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The entirety of this
content will be revealed in a digital exhibit, on a dedicated website:
<b><a href=""http://alaporte.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">alaporte.org</a></b> (available in June).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1371864/files/20150410091936-mosaique.jpg?1428682776"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>AT THE DOOR’s main
objective is to raise awareness among Montrealers and Quebecers on the
importance of universal accessibility in <b>the inclusion of all citizens, with no
discrimination whatsoever</b>. The project doesn’t point fingers at any given
public organization, it only sheds a light on a reality that is unknown by most
of the population.</p>
<p>Beyond this awareness
objective, people will be provided with two means to show their support to this
cause:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Signing
an online petition to ask the Quebec Governement to create a framework-law on
universal accessibility (a law that will set official goals and engagements
towards universal accessibility) as is the case in Ontario or France.</span></li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Sending
a postcard with a picture and story from the project to the Quebec Government.
Those will be sold during the event and on the website of the project. They
also are available as perks in this crowdfunding campaign.</span><br/>
</li></ul>




Our hope is that by raising awareness on the issue of accessibility, and
by providing Montrealers and Quebecers to communicate their expectations to the
Government, measures will be implemented to make the situation evolve towards total
inclusion.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">

<h4><b>$ 6,000 GOAL: A LAUNCH EVENT</b></h4>
<p>To maximize the impact of this series,
we wish to host a launch party, in order to gather all the participants of AT
THE DOOR, everyone who helped make this project happen, and other supporters of
the cause. We will also invite the media, officials from the STM and AMT, from
the City of Montreal, and from the Government of Québec.</p>
<p><b>You too can be a part of this event by contributing to this campaign!</b></p>
<p>The AT THE DOOR project and all the activities of
Portraits of Montreal are produced entirely on a volunteering basis, and we
therefore need your help to make this event happen. We need to raise $ 6,000 to
be able to organize the event.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The official launch event of AT THE DOOR should be
held on <b>Thursday, June 4th</b>, in the middle of the '<a href=""https://www.ophq.gouv.qc.ca/evenements/semaine-quebecoise-des-personnes-handicapees/sqph-2015.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Semaine québécoise des personnes handicapées</a>' [Quebec week for handicapped persons].
The date may be subject to change based on the availabilities of a venue that
will be 100% accessible and able to host everyone.</p>
<p><b>The more we will be, the greater and the most
memorable this event will be!</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h4><b>$ 9,000 GOAL : A
PHYSICAL EXHIBIT</b></h4>

To anchor this series in the real world, we would like to create a
physical exhibit with a selection of pictures and stories from AT THE DOOR. The
exhibit will be revealed during the launch event, and then hosted in a Montreal
Gallery and open to anyone for free. And if the funds allow us to, then we
could also have the exhibit travel through the rest of Quebec!</div><div>

</div></div>","[ENGLISH FOLLOWS]Personnes en fauteuil roulant, personnes se déplaçant avec des béquilles, personnes âgées, familles avec poussette, etc. Il est estimé que le manque d'accessibilité touche au moins 600 000 Montréalais de près ou de loin. Pourtant, aucune loi n'encadre l'accessibilité universelle au Québec, et de nombreux commerces et lieux publics continuent de fermer leurs portes à toute une frange de la population.Réalisé par Portraits de Montréal grâce à l'appui de Kéven Breton, militant pour l'accessibilité universelle, À LA PORTE est un projet bénévole de sensibilisation des Montréalais et des Québécois aux impacts concrets du manque d’accessibilité de la ville sur la vie de nombreux citoyens, à mobilité réduite ou non.À LA PORTE, C'EST QUOI ?Quand le métro a été construit, il devait permettre à Montréal d'entrer dans la modernité. Aujourd'hui, seulement 8 stations sur 68 - toutes sur la ligne orange - sont accessibles à tous. Nous avons donc choisi symboliquement ce mode de transport public pour illustrer le manque d'accessibilité à Montréal et au Québec. Ainsi, 68 personnes différentes ont été photographiées devant toutes les stations du réseau de la STM, et nous ont partagé 68 anecdotes de la vie courante, tranches de vie authentiques marquées par l’inaccessibilité.L’ensemble de ce contenu sera dévoilé à travers une véritable exposition virtuelle, sur un site web dédié au projet : alaporte.org (non disponible avant juin)
À LA PORTE a pour objectif principal de sensibiliser les Montréalais et les Québécois à l’importance de l’accessibilité universelle dans l’intégration de tous les citoyens, sans discrimination aucune. Le projet ne pointe du doigt aucun acteur public spécifique, ni aucune organisation ou entreprise en particulier ; il ne fait que mettre en lumière une réalité peu comprise par la population. Au-delà de cet objectif de sensibilisation, les citoyens disposeront de deux moyens forts pour manifester leur soutien à la cause :Signer une pétition en ligne qui sera rattachée à l’exposition virtuelle et à la soirée de lancement, afin de demander au gouvernement Québécois de doter le Québec d’une loi-cadre sur l’accessibilité universelle (= loi qui décrira un programme et en fixera les objectifs et les engagements dans la durée) comme c'est déjà le cas en Ontario ou en France par exemple. Envoyer au gouvernement Québécois des cartes postales reprenant certaines des 68 photos/histoires de la série, et qui seront vendues pour la somme symbolique de 5$/unité lors de l'événement puis sur le site web dédié au projet. Elles seront également disponibles en contrepartie de certaines contributions à cette campagne de socio-financement.Notre espoir est qu’en sensibilisant l’ensemble des Montréalais et des Québécois aux enjeux de l’accessibilité, et en leur donnant les outils pour manifester leurs attentes auprès des pouvoirs publics, des mesures seront prises pour faire évoluer la situation dans le sens de l'inclusion totale.OBJECTIF 6000 $ : UN ÉVÉNEMENT DE LANCEMENTPour maximiser l’impact de cette série et de cette exposition virtuelle, nous souhaitons organiser une soirée de lancement, afin de réunir les participants de À LA PORTE, toutes les personnes qui ont rendu possible ce projet, et d'autres défenseurs de l'accessibilité universelle. Nous inviterons également les médias, des représentants de la STM et de l’AMT, de la mairie et des municipalités de Montréal, et du Gouvernement du Québec, dans l'espoir de pouvoir faire avancer la situation.Vous pourrez vous aussi faire partie de cet événement citoyen en contribuant à cette campagne.Le projet À LA PORTE et l'ensemble des activités de Portraits de Montréal sont réalisés de façon 100% bénévole, et nous avons donc besoin de votre aide pour concrétiser cet événement. Il nous faut lever 6000 $ pour pouvoir en financer l'organisation.Prévu sous forme de 5 à 7 étendu, fort en émotions et en animations, le lancement de À LA PORTE devrait avoir lieu le jeudi 4 juin 2015, durant la Semaine québécoise des personnes handicapées. La date reste toutefois sujette à changement en fonction des disponibilités d'une salle 100% accessible qui puisse accueillir toutes les personnes qui souhaitent venir.Plus nous serons nombreux, plus l'événement sera grandiose et mémorable !OBJECTIF 9000 $ : UNE EXPOSITION PHYSIQUEPour encrer cette série dans la réalité, nous aimerions également mettre sur pied une véritable exposition physique avec une quinzaine de photos et les histoires qui vont avec. L'ensemble sera présenté en exclusivité lors de la soirée de lancement, puis déplacé dans une galerie de Montréal où les citoyens pourront ensuite aller la découvrir gratuitement. Et si les fonds collectés nous le permettent peut-être pourrons nous également la faire voyager à travers le reste du Québec !Cette magnifique exposition physique ne pourra avoir lieu que si nous parvenons à lever 9000 $.À PROPOS DE PORTRAITS DE MONTRÉALPortraits de Montréal est l’adaptation Montréalaise de Humans of New York. Sur ce blogue sont présentés des portraits d'humains rencontrés de façon aléatoire dans les rues de Montréal. Chaque portrait se compose d’une photo de la personne et d’un morceau choisi de la conversation qui a eu lieu lors de la rencontre. Créé en mars 2014, il rejoint aujourd’hui près de 80 000 personnes par semaine, et a bénéficié d’une vaste couverture médiatique (Radio-Canada, TVA, City, La Presse, Gazette, Journal Métro, 24 Heures, Huffington Post, Urbania, Nightlife, et bien d'autres). À noter que Portraits de Montréal est un blogue à but purement artistique et social, qui cherche à rapprocher les humains et qui ne génère aucun revenu de ses activités.Pour nous contacter : portraitsdemontreal@gmail.comLiens utiles :

[ENGLISH TEXT]
People in wheelchairs,
people walking with clutches, elderly people, families with strollers, etc. It
is estimated that the lack of accessibility affects at least 600,000 Montrealers. Yet, there is no law to provide a framework to universal
accessibility in Quebec, and many businesses and public places still keep their
doors closed to a whole part of the population.
Produced by Portraits of Montréal with the help of Kéven Breton, supporter of universal accessibility,
AT THE DOOR aims to raise awareness on the impacts of our city’s lack of accessibility
in the lives of many citizens, with or without limited mobility.

WHAT IS AT THE DOOR?
When the metro was
built, it was meant to allow Montreal to enter the age of modernity. Today,
only 8 stations out of 68 – all on the orange line – are accessible to all. As
a symbol we chose this public transportation system to illustrate the lack of
accessibility in Montreal and in Québec. Therefore, 68 different people were
photographed in front of the 68 metro stations, and shared 68 everyday life
anecdotes, authentic stories all linked by the issue of inaccessibility.
The entirety of this
content will be revealed in a digital exhibit, on a dedicated website:
alaporte.org (available in June).




AT THE DOOR’s main
objective is to raise awareness among Montrealers and Quebecers on the
importance of universal accessibility in the inclusion of all citizens, with no
discrimination whatsoever. The project doesn’t point fingers at any given
public organization, it only sheds a light on a reality that is unknown by most
of the population.
Beyond this awareness
objective, people will be provided with two means to show their support to this
cause:

Signing
an online petition to ask the Quebec Governement to create a framework-law on
universal accessibility (a law that will set official goals and engagements
towards universal accessibility) as is the case in Ontario or France.

Sending
a postcard with a picture and story from the project to the Quebec Government.
Those will be sold during the event and on the website of the project. They
also are available as perks in this crowdfunding campaign.





Our hope is that by raising awareness on the issue of accessibility, and
by providing Montrealers and Quebecers to communicate their expectations to the
Government, measures will be implemented to make the situation evolve towards total
inclusion.

$ 6,000 GOAL: A LAUNCH EVENT
To maximize the impact of this series,
we wish to host a launch party, in order to gather all the participants of AT
THE DOOR, everyone who helped make this project happen, and other supporters of
the cause. We will also invite the media, officials from the STM and AMT, from
the City of Montreal, and from the Government of Québec.
You too can be a part of this event by contributing to this campaign!
The AT THE DOOR project and all the activities of
Portraits of Montreal are produced entirely on a volunteering basis, and we
therefore need your help to make this event happen. We need to raise $ 6,000 to
be able to organize the event.
The official launch event of AT THE DOOR should be
held on Thursday, June 4th, in the middle of the 'Semaine québécoise des personnes handicapées' [Quebec week for handicapped persons].
The date may be subject to change based on the availabilities of a venue that
will be 100% accessible and able to host everyone.
The more we will be, the greater and the most
memorable this event will be!

$ 9,000 GOAL : A
PHYSICAL EXHIBIT

To anchor this series in the real world, we would like to create a
physical exhibit with a selection of pictures and stories from AT THE DOOR. The
exhibit will be revealed during the launch event, and then hosted in a Montreal
Gallery and open to anyone for free. And if the funds allow us to, then we
could also have the exhibit travel through the rest of Quebec!
This beautiful exhibition will take place only if we're capable to raise 9,000 $.

ABOUT PORTRAITS OF MONTREAL
Portraits de Montréal is the Montreal
version of Humans of New York.
On this blog are presented portraits of humans
randomly met in the streets of Montreal. Each portrait comes with an extract of
the conversation that took place when the photo was shot. Created in March
2014, it now reaches close to 80,000 weekly, and gained mass media coverage (Radio-Canada, TVA, City, La Presse, Gazette, Journal Métro, 24 Heures, Huffington Post, Urbania, Nightlife, and many more).
It’s important to note that Portraits of Montréal is an
artistic blog meant to bring humans closer together, and generates no revenue
from its activities.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>  Collecting funds for the “Tarot of Fates”, will provide us the ability to pay for the printing (making a start with 500pcs) and promotion expenses. Even though we believe that you will spread the word after seeing our work, we won’t stop there. An e-shop with amazing greek products such as clothes, jewelry, decoration, shoes, games and much more is being prepared. And if we reach the goal x4 android + ios applications is also planned. And our journey will begin thanks to your help.</p>
<p>  Special items, packaged in a beautiful way, have been chosen to be used as perks and we are pretty sure that you or a person you love will enjoy them. Those perks will act as reminders of Greece, bringing to you a taste of ancient times and elegance as well, for this is exactly what we wish to give you through this deck and upcoming future products.</p>
<p>So, spread the word to your friends and family for something BIG is here!</p>
<p>May you all be in good health!</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p align=""center"">Do you dare to discover what the Fates have for you?</p>
<p>  A destiny predetermined by the Fates, a power acting in parallel with the Gods that even they have not the power to change.</p>
<p align=""center"">Clotho – the spinner, Lachesis – the allotter and Atropos – the unturnable, controlled the mother thread of life for every mortal from birth to death. Do they still do?</p>
<p>  In the ancient times of Greece the Oracles had a role in people’s lives. Answers would be given to questions about the future and history was written according to what the Fates determined. Oracles, secrets and mysteries in the ancient times are things that are possible to experience today by using the cards of the “Tarot of Fates” deck and find the answers to matters that trouble us. It was done then, in the ancient times and it is done again today. All you have to do is believe and you can find the oracle hidden in you.</p>
<p>  As Clotho spun the thread of life, Lachesis measured it allotted to each person with her measuring rod and finally Atropos, inevitably, would cut the thread of life. She chose the manner of each person’s death and when their time was come, she cut their life thread with her shears.</p>
<p>  So, Lachesis presented the things that were, Clotho the things that are and Atropos the things that are to be. Goddesses of great honor, placed by the side of Zeus said to be the daughters of Nyx and sisters of the Hours.</p>
<p>  The interpretations of the cards are easy and clear. The images and figures have been carefully selected because the meanings hide stories to be explored based upon the history of such an important civilization. The book that is included contains stories for each figure, so that you can learn and therefore understand more about the meanings of the cards and any deeper meanings that are hidden.</p>
<p>  My goal is to bring to all of you the chance to get to know piece by piece, story by story my country’s history and to use your imagination to discover the mystical part of the ancient Greek world where divinity always played an important role.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE AMAZING TEAM</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Creator</strong></p>
<p>My name is Kalliopi Kapousizi and i aim to bring to you as much divinity and harmony as possible through this amazing Tarot deck. I wish to bring something of the old ways to our modern world, unveiling the possibilities that each one of us have inside us and stay hidden, due to the challenges we face everyday.</p>
<p>I am a positive thinker, i believe in the energy of the universe and to the secrets it contains. This is why i wanted to design a tarot deck based on a civilization where oracles were taken into serious consideration a lot. The tarot of the Fates can be used by everyone, with understandable but deep meanings. A long time ago, people believed in destiny and they still do and this happens for a reason.</p>
<p>I believe that there is more than just trying to explain the words of Gods or what is  not understood. There are great powers around us and most of all inside us.</p>
<p>Let's find them and bring them out!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Graphic Designer</strong></p>
<p>George was born in a family of artists. He enjoys drawing and has a strong fantasy, being able to create something entirely out of his mind. And i find that extraordinary. As a young boy he loved to draw dinosaurs, dragons and beasts of all kind and to be honest he still does. His skills don't stop here, he is a great dps player in World of Warcraft! As a person of high expectations from himself with dreams and goals, it was very easy for me to choose him, to create this time my dream. And it was a GO!</p>
<p>I hope the images are as pleasant to your eyes as they are to mine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Advisor</strong></p>
<p>Sofia is literally the person that came into my life unexpectedly, when we both joined a class and we somehow matched. She is trully the smartest person i know, always learning something new and i admire her for that. She is actually a well established architect, but that was never enough for her. Other than working and being a very good singer, she is always expanding her knowledge and she shares that with me with pleasure.</p>
<p>Angel and fairies, positive pshycology,  affirmations, energy healing, powerful mind thinking, card decks and many many more are some of the things i found out because of Sofia. Often, i tell her that when i have kids one day, she better be into their lives teaching them everything she knows and she laughs. A true friend that i love so much.</p>
<p>Thank you Sofia and Thank you Universe!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Photographer</strong></p>
<p>Well, i don't know what to say about my mom. She is the best mom i could wish for. She loves taking pictures of buildings and nature, but especially abandoned places. She has a totally different way of seeing things than me and i learn a lot from her. She loves travelling and meeting new people, getting to know their habbits and daily routine capturing the unseen with her camera.</p>
<p>I Love you Miterion ! (that's how i call her) </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My Family &amp; Friends</strong></p>
<p>And my team grows bigger with all these amazing people standing by my side unconditionally 24/7. Family members in Thessaloniki and Athens have helped me, each one of them on a different way, assisting me daily on this project. There are also dear friends like Triantafyllos and Mina who did their best preparing this campaign and deck. I am blessed for having all these people by my side, supporting me, for we make a great team!</p>

  Collecting funds for the “Tarot of Fates”, will provide us the ability to pay for the printing (making a start with 500pcs) and promotion expenses. Even though we believe that you will spread the word after seeing our work, we won’t stop there. An e-shop with amazing greek products such as clothes, jewelry, decoration, shoes, games and much more is being prepared. And if we reach the goal x4 android + ios applications is also planned. And our journey will begin thanks to your help.
  Special items, packaged in a beautiful way, have been chosen to be used as perks and we are pretty sure that you or a person you love will enjoy them. Those perks will act as reminders of Greece, bringing to you a taste of ancient times and elegance as well, for this is exactly what we wish to give you through this deck and upcoming future products.
So, spread the word to your friends and family for something BIG is here!
May you all be in good health!
INTRODUCTION
Do you dare to discover what the Fates have for you?
  A destiny predetermined by the Fates, a power acting in parallel with the Gods that even they have not the power to change.
Clotho – the spinner, Lachesis – the allotter and Atropos – the unturnable, controlled the mother thread of life for every mortal from birth to death. Do they still do?
  In the ancient times of Greece the Oracles had a role in people’s lives. Answers would be given to questions about the future and history was written according to what the Fates determined. Oracles, secrets and mysteries in the ancient times are things that are possible to experience today by using the cards of the “Tarot of Fates” deck and find the answers to matters that trouble us. It was done then, in the ancient times and it is done again today. All you have to do is believe and you can find the oracle hidden in you.
  As Clotho spun the thread of life, Lachesis measured it allotted to each person with her measuring rod and finally Atropos, inevitably, would cut the thread of life. She chose the manner of each person’s death and when their time was come, she cut their life thread with her shears.
  So, Lachesis presented the things that were, Clotho the things that are and Atropos the things that are to be. Goddesses of great honor, placed by the side of Zeus said to be the daughters of Nyx and sisters of the Hours.
  The interpretations of the cards are easy and clear. The images and figures have been carefully selected because the meanings hide stories to be explored based upon the history of such an important civilization. The book that is included contains stories for each figure, so that you can learn and therefore understand more about the meanings of the cards and any deeper meanings that are hidden.
  My goal is to bring to all of you the chance to get to know piece by piece, story by story my country’s history and to use your imagination to discover the mystical part of the ancient Greek world where divinity always played an important role.
 
THE AMAZING TEAM
The Creator
My name is Kalliopi Kapousizi and i aim to bring to you as much divinity and harmony as possible through this amazing Tarot deck. I wish to bring something of the old ways to our modern world, unveiling the possibilities that each one of us have inside us and stay hidden, due to the challenges we face everyday.
I am a positive thinker, i believe in the energy of the universe and to the secrets it contains. This is why i wanted to design a tarot deck based on a civilization where oracles were taken into serious consideration a lot. The tarot of the Fates can be used by everyone, with understandable but deep meanings. A long time ago, people believed in destiny and they still do and this happens for a reason.
I believe that there is more than just trying to explain the words of Gods or what is  not understood. There are great powers around us and most of all inside us.
Let's find them and bring them out!
 
The Graphic Designer
George was born in a family of artists. He enjoys drawing and has a strong fantasy, being able to create something entirely out of his mind. And i find that extraordinary. As a young boy he loved to draw dinosaurs, dragons and beasts of all kind and to be honest he still does. His skills don't stop here, he is a great dps player in World of Warcraft! As a person of high expectations from himself with dreams and goals, it was very easy for me to choose him, to create this time my dream. And it was a GO!
I hope the images are as pleasant to your eyes as they are to mine.
 
The Advisor
Sofia is literally the person that came into my life unexpectedly, when we both joined a class and we somehow matched. She is trully the smartest person i know, always learning something new and i admire her for that. She is actually a well established architect, but that was never enough for her. Other than working and being a very good singer, she is always expanding her knowledge and she shares that with me with pleasure.
Angel and fairies, positive pshycology,  affirmations, energy healing, powerful mind thinking, card decks and many many more are some of the things i found out because of Sofia. Often, i tell her that when i have kids one day, she better be into their lives teaching them everything she knows and she laughs. A true friend that i love so much.
Thank you Sofia and Thank you Universe!
 
The Photographer
Well, i don't know what to say about my mom. She is the best mom i could wish for. She loves taking pictures of buildings and nature, but especially abandoned places. She has a totally different way of seeing things than me and i learn a lot from her. She loves travelling and meeting new people, getting to know their habbits and daily routine capturing the unseen with her camera.
I Love you Miterion ! (that's how i call her) 
 
My Family & Friends
And my team grows bigger with all these amazing people standing by my side unconditionally 24/7. Family members in Thessaloniki and Athens have helped me, each one of them on a different way, assisting me daily on this project. There are also dear friends like Triantafyllos and Mina who did their best preparing this campaign and deck. I am blessed for having all these people by my side, supporting me, for we make a great team!

People come from around the world to visit exhibits at The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art as well as to see productions at The Asolo Repertory Theatre, or one of the many Sarasota local theaters.</p><p>Sarasota is also a draw for talented artists who temporarily locate here to hone their craft at the award-winning Ringling School of Art and Design. Usually students leave Sarasota after school because they don’t have a supportive environment to stay. What if there was a place for Ringling graduates to feel inspired, welcomed and supported, so that they want to remain in Sarasota after completing their degrees?</p><p><strong>There is now such a place being created!</strong></p><p><strong>SPAACES </strong>an energetic, thriving environment for living, breathing artists who want to work in and gain inspiration from a contemporary, collaborative, and experiential artistic universe.

I was the recipient of Indiana University’s Graduate Studies Research Grant for Florence, Italy, the Charles Lanham Fellowship for Travel Abroad, and was award a research grant at the Vermont Studio Center. I have instructed art for 20 years including Buffalo State College, The University of Tampa, Santa Fe University of Art and Design, and currently at the Ringling School of Art and Design where I was awarded a faculty grant.</p><p>I have years of extensive experience in retail management and have managed clothing stores such as Casual Corner and Macy's. My experiences through teaching, managing, creating as an artist, and perspective gained in the art world through travel make me uniquely qualified to be able to carry out the vision of SPAACES and offer a community for working artists in Sarasota.</p><p>When I reflect on my life and my past, I can see that all I have done has led me to this point of creating SPAACES for the artists of Sarasota, FL. </p><p>This campaign is aimed to specifically subsidize new artist studios, however SPAACES has an ongoing outreach and involvement with the community in many different ways. If we don't reach the amount of our entire goal, the funds received will go to the management, building, exhibitions, and organizational aspects of SPAACES and the efforts of its continued growth. If we do not reach our goal, the plan for a 12 month lease for subsidized studios would not work, therefore the art studios will be rented out to individuals willing and able to pay the full cost of the art studio.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551381431/ukhvhnb65y6axhtd00qr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>COMMUNITY PROJECTS</strong></p><p><strong>SPAACES </strong>brings the community together to consider a variety of art activities including social, political, and cultural themes.</p><p><strong>NEW ART FORMS</strong></p><p><strong>SPAACES</strong> specializes in progressive forms of contemporary art, social practice art, and collaborative artistic events and exhibitions.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551381514/ulck6niyo8v1eaz9zltm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>CULTURAL HUB</strong></p><p><strong>SPAACES </strong>is a non-profit modeled, visual arts, cultural organization benefiting diverse Sarasota, Florida communities and Florida artists</p><p><strong>Making it Happen:</strong></p><p><strong>SPAACES</strong> is centrally located just a few blocks northeast of downtown Sarasota in an air-conditioned industrial space that allows for the creation of all manner of contemporary works.</p><p><strong>SPAACES </strong>Art Studio Program initial footprint contains three art studio spaces to be subsidized by this campaign and then rented far below the average rate for creative space in the Sarasota area, and an intimate gallery for displaying local work.</p><p><strong>SPAACES</strong> is a unique environment created by artists for artists.

Chapel creates these paintings by fusing together thick layers of encaustic wax to create relief-like texture, and using carving techniques to soften edges, melt blocks together and eliminate others.</p><p>Marianne grew up exploring the city-like, low income housing development where she lived with her mom and four older sisters. The sprawling, identical, apartment buildings were built in three phases and covered ten acres. The boundaries she pushed and the buildings she hid behind became areas of special significance and limitation. Chapel ordered this world into a system of invisible linear diagrams and imaginary geometric shapes which marked areas of refuge, restrictions, safety and risk. At home, she was preoccupied with drawing made-up maps of unknown locations and well-organized house designs with intricate floor plans. She immersed herself in the challenge of combining the necessary rooms of a house in an efficient way, each rectangular space fitting together like a puzzle piece.</p><p>I thickly apply encaustic wax and use carving techniques to soften edges, melt blocks together and eliminate others. My methods mirror the building and rebuilding of architecture. Like sites that have been destroyed and rebuilt, I build art, rearrange it, and build it again.</p><p><strong>*20% of funds go to crowdfunding fulfillment services</strong></p></div>","My name is Marianne Chapel, I’m an artist, art instructor, and founder of a contemporary art gallery.

SPAACES will invite applicants to submit proposals and call finalists for in-person interviews, ultimately landing on two individuals.Your contribution will help make an important impact in Sarasota’s artistic community, helping it grow from the wonderful home for traditional art that it already is, to include a much-needed collaborative space for working artists, and a visiting place for the connoisseurs who appreciate boundary-pushing contemporary art by up-and-coming artists.Your contribution will change the lives of dedicated, working artists by giving them a unique opportunity to have the time and space to create art that will have an impacting affect in our world. Your donation will help grow art tourism in Sarasota, positively affecting the artists, the public audience, art appreciators, and all who come to see artists at work.This is an opportunity for you to be part of something new and unique, a catalyst for artistic innovation in the art scene in Sarasota.SPAACES is a non-profit modeled, visual arts, cultural organization benefiting diverse Sarasota, Florida communities and Florida artists.This project will create a huge shift for the city of Sarasota!As a resident of Sarasota and working artist, I have been aware of the distinct absence of affordable art studio spaces. I have tapped into my experiences of travel and teaching to formulate the concept for SPAACES, and to mold that idea into an operating visual arts gallery and studio space in Sarasota.Sarasota, FL has long been a cultural destination for those interested in visual and performing arts venues. People come from around the world to visit exhibits at The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art as well as to see productions at The Asolo Repertory Theatre, or one of the many Sarasota local theaters.Sarasota is also a draw for talented artists who temporarily locate here to hone their craft at the award-winning Ringling School of Art and Design. Usually students leave Sarasota after school because they don’t have a supportive environment to stay. What if there was a place for Ringling graduates to feel inspired, welcomed and supported, so that they want to remain in Sarasota after completing their degrees?There is now such a place being created!SPAACES an energetic, thriving environment for living, breathing artists who want to work in and gain inspiration from a contemporary, collaborative, and experiential artistic universe. This new artistic area will create the much needed nurture and support for Sarasota Artists, and create a destination location for art tourism.Why I'm qualified to manage this project:I earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Buffalo State College and a Master of Fine Arts from Indiana University. I was the recipient of Indiana University’s Graduate Studies Research Grant for Florence, Italy, the Charles Lanham Fellowship for Travel Abroad, and was award a research grant at the Vermont Studio Center. I have instructed art for 20 years including Buffalo State College, The University of Tampa, Santa Fe University of Art and Design, and currently at the Ringling School of Art and Design where I was awarded a faculty grant.I have years of extensive experience in retail management and have managed clothing stores such as Casual Corner and Macy's. My experiences through teaching, managing, creating as an artist, and perspective gained in the art world through travel make me uniquely qualified to be able to carry out the vision of SPAACES and offer a community for working artists in Sarasota.When I reflect on my life and my past, I can see that all I have done has led me to this point of creating SPAACES for the artists of Sarasota, FL. This campaign is aimed to specifically subsidize new artist studios, however SPAACES has an ongoing outreach and involvement with the community in many different ways. If we don't reach the amount of our entire goal, the funds received will go to the management, building, exhibitions, and organizational aspects of SPAACES and the efforts of its continued growth. If we do not reach our goal, the plan for a 12 month lease for subsidized studios would not work, therefore the art studios will be rented out to individuals willing and able to pay the full cost of the art studio.COMMUNITY PROJECTSSPAACES brings the community together to consider a variety of art activities including social, political, and cultural themes.NEW ART FORMSSPAACES specializes in progressive forms of contemporary art, social practice art, and collaborative artistic events and exhibitions.CULTURAL HUBSPAACES is a non-profit modeled, visual arts, cultural organization benefiting diverse Sarasota, Florida communities and Florida artistsMaking it Happen:SPAACES is centrally located just a few blocks northeast of downtown Sarasota in an air-conditioned industrial space that allows for the creation of all manner of contemporary works.SPAACES Art Studio Program initial footprint contains three art studio spaces to be subsidized by this campaign and then rented far below the average rate for creative space in the Sarasota area, and an intimate gallery for displaying local work.SPAACES is a unique environment created by artists for artists. It provides affordable studio space for artists working to make their living through their craft, and it provides an artistic oasis of contemporary, experiential art for the community to enjoy.SPAACES is a visual arts organization dedicated to supporting artists by offering subsidized, affordable art studios, quality exhibitions, and an encouraging, creative environment. We specialize in high caliber, new forms of art and provide collaborative space for exciting community projects.SPAACES makes a profound difference in the lives of the artists who participate, empowering their artistic voice through professional development, worldly exposure, and intellectual exploration.SPAACES is Sarasota’s home for visual arts studios and collaborative art programming. We nurture a vibrant arts community, foster artistic excellence, and bring people together for powerful shared experiences that inspires a creative exchange of ideas. SPAACES is a unique artistic microcosm in the Sarasota visual arts landscape, moving Sarasota up the ranks in art tourism.Please give a gift today.And please help us to get the word out to others and to make some noise about this campaign by sharing – use the Indiegogo share tools!Perks included in contributions:SPAACES Ceramic Mug:Warm up your mornings with a hot cup of coffee in the SPAACES White Ceramic Mug Cup o’ Joe.

Printed on archival paper, this artwork is rich with warm tones of golden yellow, soft gray, navy blue, white, punchy red, and a splash of bright turquoise. This is a print of an original artwork of an encaustic wax painting. Chapel creates these paintings by fusing together thick layers of encaustic wax to create relief-like texture, and using carving techniques to soften edges, melt blocks together and eliminate others.Marianne grew up exploring the city-like, low income housing development where she lived with her mom and four older sisters. The sprawling, identical, apartment buildings were built in three phases and covered ten acres. The boundaries she pushed and the buildings she hid behind became areas of special significance and limitation. Chapel ordered this world into a system of invisible linear diagrams and imaginary geometric shapes which marked areas of refuge, restrictions, safety and risk. At home, she was preoccupied with drawing made-up maps of unknown locations and well-organized house designs with intricate floor plans. She immersed herself in the challenge of combining the necessary rooms of a house in an efficient way, each rectangular space fitting together like a puzzle piece.I thickly apply encaustic wax and use carving techniques to soften edges, melt blocks together and eliminate others. My methods mirror the building and rebuilding of architecture. Like sites that have been destroyed and rebuilt, I build art, rearrange it, and build it again.*20% of funds go to crowdfunding fulfillment services",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The art object for Burning Man 2021 created by a group of artists from Ukraine and Russia who already created BRC art objects in 2015, 2018, 2019. Wooden statue of a human floating in the desert. Half sunk in the ground. It is huge and massive and asks people a lot of questions regarding humans in the modern world. These questions are not easy, often incomprehensible, and always different. What is yours? Share with us.<br/><br/>The art got approval from Burning man Honoraria in 2020, but due to pandemics, it wasn`t issued. One prototype of the art was already created for one of the creative spaces in Moscow. The next goals: to create one more prototype in Ukraine and the main sculpture for Black Rock City 2021 (yes we strongly believe that Burning Man 2021 will take place this year!)</p>

<p>Le Premier Tome is the first volume of L'amour Déshabillée (love undressed). The L'amour Déshabillée: Graphic Illustrated Haiku Series is a collection of illustrated haikus by Fine Art Creator Doris Faye Jones. Each volume has ten haikus illustrated with single page artwork and a second three-panel story page. The single-page pieces convey the overall theme of each haiku and the three-panel story pages fully illustrate each line of the haiku. Le Premier Tome features hand-painted symbolic artwork digitally enhanced by the artist. Lettering was completed by the artist using her own personally created font set.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact: </strong>This campaign will assist in launching me into the world of serial publishing. The illustrated haiku series with my artwork brings this poetic form to an entirely different level. The illustrations bring to life the personal and intimate meanings of the poetry. This also gives me the unique opportunity to share the vulnerable side of my creativity in a multitude of ways.</p>
<p>The contributions for this campaign will assist me with the continuation of this series, as well as enable me to transition to some use of digital illustrating. In the forthcoming future, it is my further aspirations to complete the illustrations for children's books I have written, complete the current poetic story collection I'm working on ('This is NOT Emotional Burlesque'); as well as other projects I have planned. </p>

<p><strong>The Impact for Others: </strong>Art is Life. Life is complicated, challenging, and often downright cruel. The power of painting, writing, sketching, reading, movies, games and all things of the imagination bring joy to the human spirit. My artwork in the simplest of terms is all 'labors of love'.</p>
<p>There is a story within the stories behind every piece of artwork I've ever created. This illustrated haiku series was the first project where the artwork was conceptualized directly from the poetry and the meaning of the words. This was definitely a challenging project, but one well worth the time and effort as the payoff creatively is immense.</p>
<p>The haiku poems are brought into a multi-dimensional presentation that invokes the reader's passion for words and art simultaneously. </p>

<p><strong>Just who am I?</strong></p>
<p>Professionally, I've maintained a solid foundation and footing within the field of Healthcare; a successful career that spans three decades. Creatively, I've been creating in one form or fashion for decades beginning with photography at the age of 9.  Studio portrait photographer was my only primary employment role outside of Healthcare. </p>
<p>I began filling notebooks with my poetry in junior high and wrote comedy in one way or another for much of my life. I was affectionately nicknamed, The Amazon Beauty in 10th grade. In 2006, I began my comedy career doing standup and used this as my comedic persona; and have done so since. This year, I launched two Webtoons series (haiku &amp; comedy). I have aspirations to also formally create a printed comic series as well.</p>
<p>In 2015, I transitioned from primarily working on paper with charcoal to fine art canvas paintings using a variety of mediums, primarily watercolors. I also seal most of my art with a high gloss acrylic spray to enhance the shine, sheen, look and overall effect conceived 'in my artist brain'.</p>
<p>My artistic endeavors also include, but are not limited to, talk show host, directing, comedy writing, acting, and more. I've also been a ghostwriter to a few comics over the years. </p>
<p><i>In addition, I am <strong>Diva Dori</strong> of Diva Daily Living. ""Diva Daily Living encompasses a myriad of human engagements of Life. Our topics have no limits. We do demand providing a safe space to hold for all survivors and loves needing healing, support and comfort. We're here to remind you that YOU MATTER &amp; you can CHOOSE LIFE TODAY. I am literally NOT here for me. My creator put me here… For you. - Diva Dori</i></p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Risks? Honestly... I don't see any risks here. Unless we are talking about the soul-baring epic levels of OH MY GOD! .... I'm going to let people 'get to know me?'!!!</p>
<p>In the general sense, this project is already a success. It is fully written, illustrated and the edition one author's copy is in hand. There will be challenges to the upcoming process of 'my first campaign, oh my God!'.</p>
<p>I will humbly be challenged by the intensity of self-promotion, networking, marketing, and letting people 'see me'. The honest real core me? would rather stay in the background and just create. I do have an upcoming plan to transition away from my traditional employment role in healthcare and more critically devote my time and energy to publishing, creating art, and producing entertaining content. It is my purpose and mission to share as much Art with others as I possibly can to ease the overwhelming exhausting experience of being Human.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to give this a look. If you can't contribute, please feel free to share the campaign to get the word out using the Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p>Otherwise, please pretty please ask me anything you may think of. </p>

</div></div>","Le Premier Tome is the first volume of L'amour Déshabillée (love undressed). The L'amour Déshabillée: Graphic Illustrated Haiku Series is a collection of illustrated haikus by Fine Art Creator Doris Faye Jones. Each volume has ten haikus illustrated with single page artwork and a second three-panel story page. The single-page pieces convey the overall theme of each haiku and the three-panel story pages fully illustrate each line of the haiku. Le Premier Tome features hand-painted symbolic artwork digitally enhanced by the artist. Lettering was completed by the artist using her own personally created font set.

Each volume has a 2nd coloring edition. This edition is the creator's contribution to mental wellness by offering a coloring book for the therapeutic benefits of art therapy.

Doris Faye Jones 
Dori is a Creator using myriads of mediums. She is primarily a fine art painter and poet. She is also an actress, director, producer, comic, voiceover talent, videography & photographer; as well as spoken word performer. In 2021, she wrote, produced, and distributed her first full-length spoken word album with music she personally composed. The album is a companion piece to a tribute poetry collection: The Magic Man Collection: A Tribute to Van Bates, BLACK HESHER.
https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4uqn3J1YBbw...

 
The Impact: This campaign will assist in launching me into the world of serial publishing. The illustrated haiku series with my artwork brings this poetic form to an entirely different level. The illustrations bring to life the personal and intimate meanings of the poetry. This also gives me the unique opportunity to share the vulnerable side of my creativity in a multitude of ways.
The contributions for this campaign will assist me with the continuation of this series, as well as enable me to transition to some use of digital illustrating. In the forthcoming future, it is my further aspirations to complete the illustrations for children's books I have written, complete the current poetic story collection I'm working on ('This is NOT Emotional Burlesque'); as well as other projects I have planned. 
 

The Impact for Others: Art is Life. Life is complicated, challenging, and often downright cruel. The power of painting, writing, sketching, reading, movies, games and all things of the imagination bring joy to the human spirit. My artwork in the simplest of terms is all 'labors of love'.
There is a story within the stories behind every piece of artwork I've ever created. This illustrated haiku series was the first project where the artwork was conceptualized directly from the poetry and the meaning of the words. This was definitely a challenging project, but one well worth the time and effort as the payoff creatively is immense.
The haiku poems are brought into a multi-dimensional presentation that invokes the reader's passion for words and art simultaneously. 


Just who am I?
Professionally, I've maintained a solid foundation and footing within the field of Healthcare; a successful career that spans three decades. Creatively, I've been creating in one form or fashion for decades beginning with photography at the age of 9.  Studio portrait photographer was my only primary employment role outside of Healthcare. 
I began filling notebooks with my poetry in junior high and wrote comedy in one way or another for much of my life. I was affectionately nicknamed, The Amazon Beauty in 10th grade. In 2006, I began my comedy career doing standup and used this as my comedic persona; and have done so since. This year, I launched two Webtoons series (haiku & comedy). I have aspirations to also formally create a printed comic series as well.
In 2015, I transitioned from primarily working on paper with charcoal to fine art canvas paintings using a variety of mediums, primarily watercolors. I also seal most of my art with a high gloss acrylic spray to enhance the shine, sheen, look and overall effect conceived 'in my artist brain'.
My artistic endeavors also include, but are not limited to, talk show host, directing, comedy writing, acting, and more. I've also been a ghostwriter to a few comics over the years. 
In addition, I am Diva Dori of Diva Daily Living. ""Diva Daily Living encompasses a myriad of human engagements of Life. Our topics have no limits. We do demand providing a safe space to hold for all survivors and loves needing healing, support and comfort. We're here to remind you that YOU MATTER & you can CHOOSE LIFE TODAY. I am literally NOT here for me. My creator put me here… For you. - Diva Dori
Risks & Challenges

Risks? Honestly... I don't see any risks here. Unless we are talking about the soul-baring epic levels of OH MY GOD! .... I'm going to let people 'get to know me?'!!!
In the general sense, this project is already a success. It is fully written, illustrated and the edition one author's copy is in hand. There will be challenges to the upcoming process of 'my first campaign, oh my God!'.
I will humbly be challenged by the intensity of self-promotion, networking, marketing, and letting people 'see me'. The honest real core me? would rather stay in the background and just create. I do have an upcoming plan to transition away from my traditional employment role in healthcare and more critically devote my time and energy to publishing, creating art, and producing entertaining content. It is my purpose and mission to share as much Art with others as I possibly can to ease the overwhelming exhausting experience of being Human.
Thank you for taking the time to give this a look. If you can't contribute, please feel free to share the campaign to get the word out using the Indiegogo share tools.
Otherwise, please pretty please ask me anything you may think of. 
Peace & Love, Dori

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>We are raising money to create twin monuments in USVI and Denmark commemorating resistance against colonial rule. The project is initiated by La Vaughn Belle/U.S. Virgin Islands and Jeannette Ehlers/Denmark-two artists connected by their shared Caribbean roots and colonial histories. We debuted a mock-up in March 2018 in front of the West Indian warehouse in Copenhagen in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the sale and transfer of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands) to the United States. As the first monument to a Black woman in Denmark, I Am Queen Mary made international headlines as a symbol that celebrates and centers the story of people who resisted Danish colonialism in the Caribbean. In 2020 the Danish government granted permission to permanently install I Am Queen Mary in front of a former colonial warehouse in Copenhagen, acknowledging the work's shift  from a temporary artwork to an important landmark in the city.</p>
<p>In December 2020 a winter storm severely damaged the monument in Copenhagen. The figure was removed and an Augmented Reality version of the sculpture was developed to activate new dialogues.

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>So many people along the way have asked us how they could help make this work permanent in Denmark and how they could help bring the monument to the Virgin Islands. Here is your chance. Your donation will help make our goal a reality, and make you a part of the project as this also belongs to you. We are raising in total over 7 million Danish kroner (1 million USD). This crowdfunding campaign is an essential part of our larger fundraising strategy. We are well on our way, as the Danish government pledged 1 million Danish kroner ($160,000 USD) with the condition that we raise the rest. </p>
<p>As a part of our campaign we have developed a series of amazing rewards in exchange for your generous support. We have a beautiful partnership with the All Power To The People Project to do an exclusive edition of t-shirts, hoodies and tote bags to support raising funds for I Am Queen Mary.</p>
<p>All Power To The People Project exists to inspire and empower each generation by creating products that communicate the history and global impact of the Black Panther Party.</p>
<p>Our pose in the figure of I Am Queen Mary was inspired by the iconic image of one of its leaders, Huey P. Newton. As President of the Dr. Huey P. Newton Foundation, his widow, Fredrika Newton together with designer Rachel Konte, co-own the brand All Power To The People Project. We are thrilled to be working with them. </p>
<p>We also designed exclusive prints that combine images from rubbings from the coral stones that were cut from the ocean by enslaved Africans with the image of the 3D body scan renderings that were used to create the figure in <i>I Am Queen Mary</i>.</p>
<p>We also recognize that some people do not want to receive any material reward for their donation. We honor that by offering a series of ""eco-options"".</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE MIND'S EYE AND ITS CREATOR</h3>
<p>The Mind's Eye is a 22-foot surrealist sculpture CURRENTLY being built by artist Launa Eddy in Tonasket, Washington. Awarded an Honoraria grant from Burning Man a week before lockdown began in 2020,  The Mind's Eye is an ambitious large-scale steel artwork that is determined to stand tall despite all the uncertainty and struggle we've faced in the last year. </p>
<p>Colorful, playful, absurd - this sculpture represents the human ability to transform adversity and trauma into something beautiful and unknown. The face, with its bright red lips representing vitality and beauty, stands tall while blue streams pour through its eye. The streams are our life force, our experiences, our struggles flowing through us. They are the leverage that holds the face in the air above the world so it can see from a new perspective. The stream travels through the eye, rising up through the mind's cloud - our consciousness, and transforms into wild creatures that were formerly unseen and unknown. The creatures are kinetic, they are movable and swing with the wind... impermanent and always changing. If you dare,  climb the stream and sit inside the eye to challenge your assumption as being just a viewer of the piece. The Mind's Eye invites you to become part of it and see the world from a new angle, if you desire. </p>
<p>Launa Eddy is a multidisciplinary artist based in New York City. Her work is playfully surrealistic, figurative, and animalistic. Through sculpture, 2D forms and multi-media performance, she exposes the absurdist nature of humanity, the animal within, and an ever-present humor shining through the realities of human darkness and struggle.  Born in Rhode Island, Launa was raised within a family of Offshore Lobstermen, and raised Alaskan Timber Wolves in the woods of New Hampshire. Her upbringing was split between deep sea fishing rigs, raising horses, breeding wolves, and a variety of eclectic animals. Her wild upbringing influenced her relationship to the world and shows up in her art.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>BUILDING AND EXPENSES</h3>
<p>The Mind's Eye is being built right now - with a projected completion date of October 1st, 2021. Meeting our fundraising goal is essential to bringing this sculpture to life and to make sure the artist has the help she needs. </p>
<p>Through this Indiegogo campaign we are expecting to raise at least $20,000, but are hoping to raise more. Donated funds will help pay for  materials, labor, specialty services, shop rentals, expenses, transportation of the piece for 2021 and 2022, and possible storage. Any amount over $20,000 will help support the artist and the crew and the inevitability that unexpected issues will arise. Costs have gone up in every direction. Steel is 3x its pre-pandemic cost. Transportation alone is estimated to cost at least $10,000 to move the sculpture from Tonasket, WA to a temporary home, then to Burning Man in 2022. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>CREW SPOTLIGHT</h3>
<p>Victor Valencia - - - Bad-ass artist and fabricator, Victor has all the skills, a no BS attitude, and also brings the smiles. He is # 1 lead on The Mind's Eye and he also came with a new rescue pup / super sweet shop dog, Chido. </p>

<p>Why you should back this campaign.<br/> </p>
<p>First to guarantee a deck.<br/> </p>
<p>Dont miss out on one of these amazing creations. Due to the specialty nature of the ink used in our neon fluorescent tarots the printer orders just enough ink to complete the job. If more is needed at the end it cannot be added. We will be ordering more or less just what we need. These inks are expensive and the cost of shipping cards to the UK is frightening, so reserve yours now dont miss out.</p>
<p>Why should I buy your neon cards there are other bright decks out there? <br/>There are other bright  cards that is true but most of them are not true fluorescent, ours is the real thing. Check out our many reviews from the Hermit's Cave , Youtube  and our many customers on Etsy and etc,,. Our cards are the real deal.  We are also experienced working with these incredible inks. </p>
<p>Second -  The cost of self publishing tarots has gone WAY up. We want to get this project out there while the price is still doable .With the ever increasing cost of postage and materials there is no guarantee we will be able to offer this deck in the future.</p>
<p>Third - Many small businesses are struggling because of the Covid restrictions. We understand a lot of this was necessary to prevent the spreading of the virus however it's been a blow to small independent creators like ourselves who like to offer these unique and experimental tarot decks.</p>
<p> Again just to make clear , it deserves restating because of the many emails we get after a campaign ends.. The printer orders all the neon ink upfront due to the neon fluorescent / inks being specialized and therefore more costly. In other words, For example If we order 200 decks from the printer, they will only buy enough ink to print those 200. So reserve yours now. </p>

<h3>hello, trekkies!</h3>
<p>i wanted to properly honour captain michael burham with a pin, so here we are! i'm so excited for season 4 of disco and the chance to actually see michael in the captain's chair where she belongs. i hope this pin will help us all celebrate that! ALSO EVERYONE GETS A FREE STICKER OF THE PIN DESIGN BECAUSE ILU.</p>
<h3>the pin</h3>
<p>the captain burnham pin is 2 inches tall. it's an enamel pin made with a combination of hard enamel and silk printing for her facial features and hair, allowing for maximum detail. each pin comes with 2 backing posts and 2 rubber clutches.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>funding goals</h3>
<p>the initial goal for the michael pin is $400USD for the pins, which will cover the cost of the manufacturing of 50 pins and the mold that they're cast in. (also, indiegogo requires we set the goal at $500CAD.) if we sell more, i can order more! no worries on that front. you'll be charged shipping separately, and i'll do my best to keep shipping as low as i can. US customers can expect around $6-8USD shipping fees. international will be $10-12.</p>
<h3>stretch goals</h3>
<p>if we raise more than our goal, i have stretch goals planned out! i'm really excited about this, because i love the challenge and the fun of unlocking bonuses as a buyer. </p>
<p>there's a special pink variant of michael's uniform that will be unlocked, as well as some unlockable add-ons like mini pins. the mini pins are: a special edition 32nd century combadge, a tiny <i>discovery</i>, and a set of stars.</p>
<p>as each stretch goal is reached, you'll be able to add extra pins to your order. the mini pins come in black and pink.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>the only risk here is the timetable! enamel pins are handmade and take time to make. the tentative finish date is late november 2021, shipping december (yes, in time for the holidays!)</p>
<p>if the stretch goals aren't reached, rest assured the michael pin will still be funded, made, and sent to you. our goal here is to get her made — the rest is just extra fun.</p>
<h3>post-funding</h3>
<p>after the campaign, the burnham pins will be available on my site for a slightly higher price. backers receive a discount!</p>

the only risk here is the timetable! enamel pins are handmade and take time to make. the tentative finish date is late november 2021, shipping december (yes, in time for the holidays!)
if the stretch goals aren't reached, rest assured the michael pin will still be funded, made, and sent to you. our goal here is to get her made — the rest is just extra fun.
post-funding
after the campaign, the burnham pins will be available on my site for a slightly higher price. backers receive a discount!",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi! I’m Courtney Blazon–I am an artist
from Missoula, Montana.<br/></p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds for my
upcoming show at the Missoula Art Museum in Montana, opening <b>September 22, 2016</b>. This show
represents the next level in my artistic evolution, allowing me to fully
integrate my love of deep research with my drive to create art that engages
people and expresses my love of historical events. </p>
<p>With your help, I will be able to produce my
best work yet. Supporting myself as an artist is not easy, and a lot of my time
is spent meeting with clients, producing small objects, completing commissions, and selling my work on a one-on-one level. But with this financial
support—particularly from this community that has always encouraged me—I
will not be stuck pulling all-nighters to make sure my electrical bills are paid, and will be able to give this time and energy that this project deserves. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I need to raise a minimum of $5,000 to make this possible. This
will cover the majority of the costs of framing the work for the show. I’ve set
my goal at <b>$6,500</b>, because I know that additional expenses and last-minute
changes  come up when you least expect it. With that extra cushion,
I will be able to sleep soundly at night without worrying about how I am going to
feed myself over the winter. </p>

<br/>
<p>Whatever money I raise will help me to
continue to make art. Making the best possible art I can and devoting myself
to my work, is what your contribution will allow me to do. Without raising my
minimum goal, I will have to fund my entire show out of pocket and take on more
commission work—burning my candle at both ends. </p>

<p>My project is valuable not only
to my own artistic growth, but to the art community of Missoula—and
ultimately for raising awareness about this fascinating historical event and
the echoes of it we are still feeling to this day. 2016 marks the bicentennial
anniversary of The Year Without A Summer—the one that followed Tambora’s
eruption. That year, 1816, catastrophic weather events were recorded around the world due to
an aerosol cloud from the volcano—events that are very similar to what we’re
seeing today due to fossil fuel emissions.</p>
<p>In order to produce
my best work, I need to focus my energy without the distraction of

demonstrate what I am truly capable of, and I want it to speak to people.
Opening September 22, 2016, at the Missoula Art Museum, <b>The Year Without A Summer</b> will include
approximately 60 pieces of art, ranging from 9"" by 12"" ink on vellum
portraits to 8-foot by 4-foot tableaus in pen and marker integrating the
various events that transpired and were inspired by Tambora’s devastation.</p>

<h3>Summary of Project</h3>
<p>“Let the children come to me, and do not prevent them; for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” (Matthew 19:14)</p>
<p>Be part of history! To our knowledge and research, this painting entitled ""Let the Children of Divorce Come to Me"" by the artist Michael Corsini, commissioned by the independent, non-profit Life-Giving Wounds, will be the first-ever Christian sacred art meant <i>specifically</i> for the healing of the one million plus children and adult children a year that suffer through their parents' divorce or separation (in the United States alone - as there are millions more each year throughout the world). These children need beauty in their lives that speaks to the heart of their experience and offers a restorative and healing experience.  </p>
<p>This painting will be a dialogue with modern art and in particular Picasso's masterpiece <i>The Tragedy</i>, which profoundly and deeply captures brokenness in family life. One interpretation of Picasso's painting could be that the family is suffering the hardship of alienation, separation, or divorce within family life. However, Picasso never revealed what the particular tragedy is. Here in our new painting, the parents are now not even facing in each other's direction, as in Picasso's painting, depicting a certain finality of their broken relationship through divorce. Yet the new painting does not just depict the pain, but also hope for the children and the family.</p>
<p>It depicts Christ on the same beach as Picasso's <i>Tragedy</i>, yet Christ walks on the ocean water, stepping towards the child, who also takes a step toward him. Christ lovingly receives the child and gently lifts the child's head to meet his eyes. Without saying a word, Christ's gaze says to the child all that is needed for him to hear in his heart as a warm, gentle light is cast from Christ's wounded hand into the hand of the child, and then to his parents and beyond. The child's open hand is a gesture full of rich symbolism; one meaning can be that of openness and love towards his parents. Likewise, the parents' expressions are full of various, diverse meanings; one of which can be that they are interested in what is happening with the child and are subtly drawn, almost mysteriously, into this healing and compassion between the child and Christ. </p>
<p>This art was born from many conversations over the years we have had with adult children of divorce, processing and grieving their pain and experiencing their joy of healing together side-by-side in our ministry. We have learned through this ministry that we need tangible reminders of God's invisible love for us and we hope this art is one of those tangible means for all of us children of divorce. We pray this art makes children of divorce feel less invisible and more seen, and ultimately inspired, comforted, and healed in many ways we can't even anticipate through this artwork.  </p>
<p>This sacred art will be available as prints and used on a unique prayer card with an original prayer composed by our ministry. The text of this original prayer is listed in the images above.</p>
<p>Help our non-profit Life-Giving Wounds make this painted, sacred encounter a real-life encounter in the lives of children of divorce through the mass production and distribution of this beautifully, unique artwork and prayer card.</p>
<p><i>WHO WE ARE: LIFE-GIVING WOUNDS</i></p>
<p>Life-Giving Wounds is an independent 501(c)3 non-profit that exists to give voice to the pain of adult children of divorce and to bring Christ's healing to them through peer-based retreats, support groups, resources, social media, and more. </p>
<p>Dr. Daniel and Bethany Meola are the founders and directors of Life-Giving Wounds. Dan is an adult child of divorce and holds a PhD from the John Paul II Institute in D.C.; Bethany has a master's degree from the Institute (which is where they met). The Meolas live in Maryland with their two young daughters.</p>
<p><i>WHO WE ARE:  MICHAEL CORSINI</i></p>
<p>Michael Corsini is a painter and illustrator, with a BFA in Illustration from Ringling School of Art and Design and an MTS from the John Paul II Institute in D.C.  </p>
<p>Michael believes that beautiful sacred art is both prophetic and healing.  He also believes that art is an essential part of the Church’s proclamation of the Gospel.  Michael often says, “The spiritual healing and renewal needed in our time, begins through an encounter with Beauty; the kind of beauty that reveals Christ, and allows for Him to do His Work.”     </p>
<p>Michael currently lives in Northeast Pennsylvania with his wife and five young children, where they are growing a small family farm.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>We need <strong>$7,500 </strong>for the mass production, distribution, and marketing of this image in various print sizes (including as a unique prayer card in both English and Spanish) so that we can distribute and sell it to as many children of divorce as possible. What you get is a copy of the image for yourself and other goodies (depending on your contribution), and the ability to join us in this mission! </p>
<p>Our extended goal is <strong>$20,000</strong>, at which point everyone who funds at any level will receive a free pack of 50 Holy Cards. This extended goal will help us further in the above costs, will support the mission work of Life-Giving Wounds, and will go towards planning and hosting events with the image, including to groups that cannot otherwise afford to host events with us, such as inner-city young adults.</p>
<p>Any extra money raised will go towards these same goals, and will further extend our reach with the image to touch a larger audience.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a very low risk project. Through a generous benefactor, we’ve already secured funding for the artist Michael Corsini's time and supplies to create the original painting, so the pre-ordered prints you order will go out no matter what. The only risk is that if we don't hit our goal, then we won't be able to market, mass produce, and distribute the image as prints as we would like to do so in order to reach as many children of divorce as we would like. And we wouldn't be able to travel or do events as widely as we hope with the image. However, we feel very confident that we will be able to raise enough money to at least make the image available as a prayer card in both English and Spanish, which is on the lower side of costs to produce.</p>
<p>The other challenge is that we will be handling all of the prints ourselves as an independent non-profit from working with the printers and a small fulfillment company to deliver them to you. This may extend the timeline on delivery of prints, but we will personally vouch for each patron's order to be completed if you donate to this project. </p>
<p> </p>

These include:</p><p>Share the project on Facebook and Instagram using our social media posts on those platforms.</p><p>Share our non-profit ministry page found on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Send the project to specific people who you think would be interested in it or benefit from it.</p><p>Share our webpage <a href=""http://www.lifegivingwounds.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lifegivingwounds.org</a> </p><p>Thank you for your support!</p></div>","Summary of Project

<p>“To him who thirsts I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.” – Revelation 21:6</p>
<p>St. Joseph, Father of All, is a painting by Michael Corsini.  It is a depiction of the first approved vision of St. Joseph by a shepherd in France.   Read the story here!  </p>
<p>On June 7th 1660, a 22 year old shepherd named Gaspard Ricard, was herding his sheep on Mount Bessillon in France. Around 1pm the heat grew stronger and harder to bear. Gaspard became very tired and thirsty, so he decided to lay upon the rocky ground for a rest.  Suddenly a tall man stood next to him and pointed to a nearby rock saying: “I am Joseph, lift the rock and you will drink.” The startled young man saw that the large rock looked heavy, asking how he would move it alone as it would take about eight men to move it. St Joseph again said, “lift the rock and you will drink.” Gaspard rose and obeyed. He moved the rock and found fresh water flowing from underneath. He began to drink but when he looked up, found that St Joseph had disappeared. He ran into town exclaiming this news to the villagers and within three hours the small spring of water had become a fountain of abundant water.</p>
<p>BIO</p>
<p>My name is Michael Corsini and I am a painter.  I am a husband, to my beautiful wife Jessie, and father of five little ones.  I have been creating works of art for healing and renewal for nearly two decades.  I have a BFA from Ringling School of Art and Design as well as a MTS from the John Paul Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family.  I also spent 5 years in temporary vows as a member of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal, in discernment of religious life and the priesthood.  Accordingly I have a deep love for fatherhood!  I believe this painting will bring healing and renewal to people of all backgrounds but is especially dedicated to those who are husbands and fathers (natural or supernatural). My intention is to bring the painting to parishes all over the country to lead people in prayer and musical holy hours for the restoration of fatherhood.  Will you join me In this mission?  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>GOAL</p>
<p>I need to gather at least $5,000 to get this project funded… that’s mostly supplies and time. What you get is a copy for yourself and other goodies (depending on your contribution), and the ability to join me in this mission!   My extended goal is $10000, at which point everyone, who funds at any level, will receive a free pack of (50) Holy Cards.  More importantly, this goal will allow me to travel with the image to parishes that can not afford to host the event!    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>My biggest challenge is that I am doing this on my own… (well with lots of moral support from my kids!) I will be handling all the prints and fulfilling orders myself. I’ll be personally working with the printers, doing the packaging, and in some form, delivering them to you. This will extend the timeline on delivery, but I will personally vouch for each patrons’ order! </p>

</div></div>","“To him who thirsts I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely.” – Revelation 21:6
St. Joseph, Father of All, is a painting by Michael Corsini.  It is a depiction of the first approved vision of St. Joseph by a shepherd in France.   Read the story here!  
On June 7th 1660, a 22 year old shepherd named Gaspard Ricard, was herding his sheep on Mount Bessillon in France. Around 1pm the heat grew stronger and harder to bear. Gaspard became very tired and thirsty, so he decided to lay upon the rocky ground for a rest.  Suddenly a tall man stood next to him and pointed to a nearby rock saying: “I am Joseph, lift the rock and you will drink.” The startled young man saw that the large rock looked heavy, asking how he would move it alone as it would take about eight men to move it. St Joseph again said, “lift the rock and you will drink.” Gaspard rose and obeyed. He moved the rock and found fresh water flowing from underneath. He began to drink but when he looked up, found that St Joseph had disappeared. He ran into town exclaiming this news to the villagers and within three hours the small spring of water had become a fountain of abundant water.
BIO
My name is Michael Corsini and I am a painter.  I am a husband, to my beautiful wife Jessie, and father of five little ones.  I have been creating works of art for healing and renewal for nearly two decades.  I have a BFA from Ringling School of Art and Design as well as a MTS from the John Paul Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family.  I also spent 5 years in temporary vows as a member of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal, in discernment of religious life and the priesthood.  Accordingly I have a deep love for fatherhood!  I believe this painting will bring healing and renewal to people of all backgrounds but is especially dedicated to those who are husbands and fathers (natural or supernatural). My intention is to bring the painting to parishes all over the country to lead people in prayer and musical holy hours for the restoration of fatherhood.  Will you join me In this mission?  
 
GOAL
I need to gather at least $5,000 to get this project funded… that’s mostly supplies and time. What you get is a copy for yourself and other goodies (depending on your contribution), and the ability to join me in this mission!   My extended goal is $10000, at which point everyone, who funds at any level, will receive a free pack of (50) Holy Cards.  More importantly, this goal will allow me to travel with the image to parishes that can not afford to host the event!    
 
Risks & Challenges
My biggest challenge is that I am doing this on my own… (well with lots of moral support from my kids!) I will be handling all the prints and fulfilling orders myself. I’ll be personally working with the printers, doing the packaging, and in some form, delivering them to you. This will extend the timeline on delivery, but I will personally vouch for each patrons’ order! 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you want to support the project but can't financially back the project, there are other ways you can help me reach my goal. These include:
Share the project on Facebook and Instagram
Share my artwork found on Facebook and Instagram
Send the project to specific people who you think would be interested in it

Thank you for your support!
 
Stretch Goals
$7,500 - Most Chaste Heart of Joseph print!  
$10,000 - To be Announced!

</div><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name's Verena, I'm a professional photographer living in Munich, Germany. Five years ago I first got in touch with Burlesque when I attended a workshop at a dance studio. A little while later I did a photographic exhibition about Munich's Burlesque performers that was very well received. At that time Burlesque already had me hooked and I even started to perform as well. The more shows I saw, the more performers I met and the more I learned about Burlesque, the more I fell in love with the art form.</span><br/></p>
<p>Burlesque has made my life so much more fun and I've made it my mission to teach as many people as possible what I've learned through Burlesque and introduce the world to the wonderful performers I've met. </p>
<p>What is Burlesque? Well, if you ask ten different performers, you'll probably get ten different answers. My answer is: Burlesque is a performing artform that is open to people of all genders, races, body types and ages. It is about loving who you are, making an enormous effort to create your own world for the five minutes that you are on stage and sharing that world with the audience. And about glitter, of course.</p>
<p>By preordering the book and supporting this campaign, you are helping me to bring my vision of a lovingly produced photo book about 48 of Germany's best Burlesque performers to life.</p>
<p>I've spent my last money on travelling around Germany and photographing burlesque performers. But to have the first 250 copies of the book printed in high quality and to make the book available on Amazon, I need 7.700 € - that's were you come in.</p>
<p><b>Here's in detail what I need the money for:</b></p>
<p>- editorial office (for the texts that go with the pictures; all texts will be in english)</p>
<p>- graphic design (I want to hire my favourite Burlesque-flyer-designer)</p>
<p>- ISBN registration</p>
<p>- printing &amp; binding the book (with some extra glitter on the cover, wooohooo!)</p>
<p>- Indiegogo- &amp; Paypal-fees</p>
<p>- taxes</p>
<p>- shipping</p>
<p><b>What you can expect from the book:</b></p>
<p>- foreword by Berlin's Burlesque-mama Lady Lou</p>
<p>- photos of 48 of Germany's best Burlesque performers (1 portrait in their stage costume, 1 portrait with their everyday look &amp; 1 photo of the performer on stage plus a personal text)</p>
<p>- backstage photos</p>
<p>Should the fundraising goal be exceeded, the extra money would be used to include more stories in the book, for example about Burlesque costumes and -makeup.</p>
<p><b>Performers in the book (in alphabetical order):</b></p>

<p><strong>(6/01/21) Second Stretch Goal Announcement - <u>$1200 USD</u> raised will mean everyone who’s backed above the ‘supporter’ tier will receive a <u>2x2” machine-embroidered patch of the requiem album print</u> for free!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>(05/26/21) Stretch Goal Announcement - <u>$800 USD</u> raised will mean everyone who’s supported above the ‘supporter’ tier will be given a <u>additional brand-new Doctor Carmilla print</u> - drawn by myself - free!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About Me!</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Isabel! I'm a genderqueer artist specializing in character illustration and concepts. I run a small online shop over at <a href=""https://ko-fi.com/stolenstardustthat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ko-fi.com/stolenstardust</a> offering commissions and official Dr. Carmilla prints in collaboration with Maki Yamazaki.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About This Campaign!</h3>
<p>This campaign will help me fund <u>high quality, gold foil accented postcard prints</u> of a recent Dr. Carmilla release cover art design that I co-created with Maki, as shown above. It will also allow fans of the Dr. Carmilla series to receive <strong>exclusive prints signed by both myself and Maki! </strong></p>
<p>These prints will hopefully be up on my store at some point in the future, though without the opportunity to get them signed, receive bonus prints, and shop discounts.  My store will also be selling them at a slightly higher price than what they will be here.</p>
<p>This campaign is currently set to run for two weeks but may be extended if interest is still high!</p>
<h3>About The 吸血鬼のｒｅｑｕｉｅm Prints!</h3>
<p>Let's get into specifics! </p>
<p>What makes these prints so special is their aforementioned gold foil accents - gorgeous, slightly raised sections of the piece that really pop. The surface of the gold foil side is extra smooth without being glossy. The back of the print will be an identical version of the front, minus the gold foil, if you happen to prefer that.</p>
<p>The size of these prints will be<strong> 4.72 x 4.72 inches</strong> - similar in size to an A6 print, though obviously with different proportions. Perfect for making wall collages, putting in a small picture frame for display, or hanging on a magnetic surface!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p><u>Indiegogo requires the campaign to be set at a minimum goal of $500.</u></p>
<p><strong>The minimum amount I would like to raise is <u style=""font-weight: bold;"">$125</u>.</strong> <strong>This is a <u>flexible funding</u> campaign, meaning that<i> o</i></strong><i><strong>rders will still be fulfilled even if the minimum amount of $125 is not reached!</strong></i></p>
<p>Reaching <u>$125</u> will cover not only the initial order price, but also helps towards the cost of transporting the signed prints, postage materials for sending out orders, and cover the Indiegogo fees.</p>
<p>All extra funds received will be used to expand my shop's available products!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Can Get!</h3>
<p>Here's some examples of what donating to this campaign could get you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive signed gold foil 吸血鬼のｒｅｑｕｉｅｍ prints</li>
<li>Discounted 'standard' Dr. Carmilla prints</li>
<li>Potential discounts on future orders from my shop</li>

If the target is reached, not only will I be happy dancing for weeks, but the development can begin! This is when your rewards will be created and sent to you, many of which are in form of gift experiences that you will be able to use once the development is complete and operational, which I am hoping will be by early summer 2021. Thank you for taking the time to look at our story and here is to a lighter and brigter 2021,Kirsty",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In 1971, martial arts icon Bruce Lee exploded on the cinema scene like a meteor and then would pass through it just as quickly.  His impact and popularity in action cinema is almost unparalleled by any other film actor, which is why the effort to fill the vacuum left by his absence is also unrivaled by any other genre.   Capitalized on by shrewdly thinking producers and hastily constructed films, the genre that would later be dubbed ""<strong>Bruceploitation</strong>"" would thrive for nearly a decade.   </p>

<p>This book will seek to take a nearly 40 year old collection of posters and advertising, many of them obtained by actor/filmmaker/martial artist Michael Worth as a young movie going genre fan.  In most cases, the art work on display is directly from the theaters that showcased them in their initial showings in Oakland and San Francisco, California where Worth would collect them after each run of the features.  Bound in a beautiful large coffee-table style hardcover book, each poster will get special attention along with a brief description and even personal history.  Not only will the book be a beautiful and fun way to enjoy and study this decade of cinema history, but will help to preserve many of these rare posters in high definition scans on beautiful thick art-book paper. </p>

<p>These books will be produced in limited qualities, catering to the collector and the fans wishing to own reproductions of these posters in their own book library.  There will be the option for donors to obtain an exclusive signed version of the book only available to the indiegogo backers.  An accompanying book by Michael Worth (<i>The Bruceploitation Bible</i>) that exhaustively covers the history of the genre along with his personal recollections of growing up on these films, is also in the printing phase and will be released in 2020, serving as a great companion to this release. </p>

I am of recent carrying out “Computer Graphics Design Course” which I am very interested in because of its high reasoning and creativity in it.</p><p><strong>About the Campaign.</strong></p><p>The reason for rising up the “Fine Art and Graphic Designs improving lives” campaign are genuine; the Campaign first and foremost is about how one especially the Artists and Graphic designers can use their talents to develop or be more creative. This is where there’s the aid of electronic devices like computers, printers, scanners and materials for producing Fine Art and graphic design products like, t-shirts, banners, flyers, calendars, logos, stickers and among many others. Graphic designs are first drawn with the aim of sketching and use of art pencils. After the sketches are transferred to the computer by the aid of the scanners to scan the images drawn in pencil into software to improve them into digital format. Some of the software include:</p><p>Adobe Photoshop, In-design and adobe illustrator.</p><p>I have only got the old laptop which am using for the work that am designing for my clients, which work at the same time is also difficult for me because of not having enough equipment and people to work on them I am forced to take the work in software format to others to finish for me thus making me lose some of the profits and time. It also makes me lose some of the customers. The profits from the business I use in paying partly to my tuition and other necessities in addition to what my parents contribute to for me for tuition, accommodation and other necessities. When I get the support I am requesting for I will be able to purchase the necessary equipment and complete my work myself thus saving more time and money. I will also be able to work with my course mates who will also be able to get income and foundation for self employment after university. I also do fine art with my hand. It is these fine artworks and graphically designed ones that will too compose perks to you my contributors.</p><p>I have premise I am renting and am working from.</p><p>My works and orders from my customers depict daily life situations such as; climate change, protection of the environment, water and sanitation, human and animal rights, health eating and living, poverty eradication etc.</p><p><strong>Necessities of the campaign.</strong></p><p>I need some of the equipment to set up the Fine Art  and Graphic Design studio.

Am staying in Kabale, Uganda based in East Africa.I am a student at Kyambogo University located in Kampala, Uganda. I am of recent carrying out “Computer Graphics Design Course” which I am very interested in because of its high reasoning and creativity in it.About the Campaign.The reason for rising up the “Fine Art and Graphic Designs improving lives” campaign are genuine; the Campaign first and foremost is about how one especially the Artists and Graphic designers can use their talents to develop or be more creative. This is where there’s the aid of electronic devices like computers, printers, scanners and materials for producing Fine Art and graphic design products like, t-shirts, banners, flyers, calendars, logos, stickers and among many others. Graphic designs are first drawn with the aim of sketching and use of art pencils. After the sketches are transferred to the computer by the aid of the scanners to scan the images drawn in pencil into software to improve them into digital format. Some of the software include:Adobe Photoshop, In-design and adobe illustrator.I have only got the old laptop which am using for the work that am designing for my clients, which work at the same time is also difficult for me because of not having enough equipment and people to work on them I am forced to take the work in software format to others to finish for me thus making me lose some of the profits and time. It also makes me lose some of the customers. The profits from the business I use in paying partly to my tuition and other necessities in addition to what my parents contribute to for me for tuition, accommodation and other necessities. When I get the support I am requesting for I will be able to purchase the necessary equipment and complete my work myself thus saving more time and money. I will also be able to work with my course mates who will also be able to get income and foundation for self employment after university. I also do fine art with my hand. It is these fine artworks and graphically designed ones that will too compose perks to you my contributors.I have premise I am renting and am working from.My works and orders from my customers depict daily life situations such as; climate change, protection of the environment, water and sanitation, human and animal rights, health eating and living, poverty eradication etc.Necessities of the campaign.I need some of the equipment to set up the Fine Art  and Graphic Design studio. The equipment for the studio  are as below:
Computer set                             Uganda Shillings (U Shs) 1,800,000/=   USD 500
Printer                                         Uganda Shillings (U Shs)  2,520,000/=  USD 700           
Digital Professional Camera        U Shs1,440,000/=  USD 400
Printing papers(A1,A2,A3,A4,A5)      U Shs720,000/=  USD 200

                              TOTAL:           U Shs 7,200,000/=                                U.S.D 2000 The target of the project.When I raise the targeted amount and buy the necessary equipment and when the initial business grows; I will set a branch in my home town area where there will be employment opportunities to many people like the youths especially those who are engaged in art and design sector.Then some of the profits from the Graphic design studio will also help in the community work especially for town cleaning, contributing to some of the needy groups like physically and mentally handicapped (disabled), paying of the taxes from the income obtained, employment which will help in youth personal development both individually and at home for the better future.Any amount of contribution is highly welcome for the well being of the Fine Art and Graphic Design Studio to improve the lives of many different people in my community.Contribute using the “BACK IT” Button on the campaign.Contact me through: kennedytukwasiibwe@gmail.com                                  https://m.facebook.com/kennedy.tukwasiibwe                                 +256787904400 whats-app.",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<p>Hey Guys, I need to Get to London in 6 Days for the Royal Academy Summer Exhibit Artist Varnish Day.</p>
<p>Hi  My Name is Louise Cutler and I am an Artist in Fort Collins Co. I found out on the 4th of Sept my painting ""Alone ll"" was just selected to exhibit at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and was sent the invite to Varnish Day. </p>
<p> Varnishing Day is one of the most colourful traditions associated with the annual Summer Exhibition. Originally the day when artists would put the finishing touches to their works within the galleries, it is now a day of celebration that we share with the artists who have been selected for the show. The Summer Exhibition is the world’s oldest open submission exhibition – which means that anyone can enter their work to be considered for inclusion. It’s happened every year since 1769, and each year an artist coordinates the exhibition. </p>
<p>This year’s Summer Exhibition committee</p>
<p>This year, the Summer Exhibition will be coordinated by renowned artist Yinka Shonibare RA. The exhibition will explore the theme of ‘Reclaiming Magic’ and celebrate the joy of creating art.</p>
<p>Yinka Shonibare will be working with a committee of Royal Academicians, chaired by the President of the Royal Academy, Rebecca Salter. The members of the 2021 Summer Exhibition committee will be: Tony Bevan, Vanessa Jackson, Mali Morris, Humphrey Ocean, Eva Rothschild, Bob and Roberta Smith, Emma Stibbon and David Adjaye.</p>
<p>This will be a lifelong experience for me. I have applied for the Royal Academy Summer Exhibit 3 other times without getting in. This was my 4th year applying for the Exhibit and this year my work was accepted.   So to have been chosen this year is more than one can imagine. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The process starts with the online application. You buy the application online and you can pay to submit one or two pieces for the first round of juring. If you are accepted for the first round the second round of juring requires the art to be in London to be presented to the panel for the final Juring. The pieces are passed in front of the Juring Artist one at a time. If your work is selected  from here you get in.</p>
<p>In order for someone from the states to submit their work for the final juring they must submit their work through a paid transportation service. So the work has to be shipped to the transportation service where they unwrap it and transport it to the Royal Academy on your behalf. The royal Academy does not accept shipped or unwrapped work. </p>
<p>The notification for exceptate came out on Sept 4 along with the Varnish date of  Sept 13 so I had little time to get a low fare Airline  ticket. The airline ticket will cost me anywhere between $1500-$2000 Hotel stay will cost me anywhere between $150 - $250 per night.  I will be staying in London one week for the exhibit and to visit a few of the galleries there as well. I am looking to raise somewhere between $5- $6,000 for my trip. </p>
<p>This is an amazing honor for me to be accepted and to be able to attend such a prestigious event where I will meet and interact with other Artist from all over the world.  It is one that I will cherish for a lifetime. There will be nothing like working the hallowed halls where other greatest artists in the world have tread. </p>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>The <strong><i>Journey of the In-Between</i></strong> is a painting series and story that will then be printed into a book in both hardback and paperback. This book is intended for children and adults alike. It will consist of 18 to 20 paintings, 4' x 4' and 4' x 5' in size. These paintings will be pages of the book that will be 8.5"" x 11"" in size. These paintings and the accompanying written story will be based on the teachings of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which is considered a handbook of living and dying in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. Once the series is finished, the paintings will also be turned into an exhibition so viewers can ""walk"" through the pages of the book and read the story alongside the art. The goal is to have this exhibition travel to hospitals, hospice, centers, spiritual centers, and art galleries.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong><u>Kyra</u></strong></p>
<p>My name is Kyra Coates, and I am an artist, writer, and long-time student of Tibetan Buddhism. My art has principally focused around emotional and psychological experiences of feminine power. You can see more of my art at <a href=""http://www.kyracoatesart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kyracoatesart.com</a>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572207713/wrojsslwzdteacg1hx7s.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Recently I was diagnosed with early cognitive decline leading to Alzheimer's disease. I'm 39 years old, so this came as a huge shock. Ironically, for years I worked on the side as a caregiver in hospice and for the elderly. I helped many people die, in particular, many people with Alzheimer's and dementia. I realized from these experiences that, as the brain degrades, we are left with our emotional imprints. These can be intense trauma's or simply peace for those who lived a life open to change and wonder. Either way, I would see people's personalities ""disappear"" along with their memories, as our personalities are really just a composite story made up of all our experiences throughout life (with a bit of hereditary impulses thrown in there). It was with these hospice clients I began to wonder. What existed there behind these stories, when the mind is gone? With my current diagnoses of facing Alzheimer's myself, this question is more poignant then ever.  Together with my partner Robert Cooper (who was too camera shy to be in the video), we will dive into this journey with the best of our talents; through art and story.</p>
<p><strong><u>Robert</u></strong></p>
<p>My name is Robert Cooper, and I am a long-time student of Tibetan Buddhism. After I had a kundalini awakening, which is a profound spiritual experience, at the age of 19, I became very interested in examining near death experiences by people all over the world.  So I read anything I could find about NDE’s.  Later when I encountered the Tibetan Book of the Dead, I realized just how accurately the Tibetans had used Buddhist mind training to thoroughly document the ""bardo"", or transition phases during death, as a means to enlightenment, or at least to a better rebirth process.  I also saw how deeply related the NDE’s are; I realized they are a universal process and driven by our own thinking and experiences in this very life.  It seemed like magic. </p>
<p>Somewhere around age twenty-six, I decided I must explore this bardo realm thoroughly before I die to have any hope of recognizing the nature of mind.  So I began vision questing in the desert.  I would prepare to die for 30 days, then I would take my body to the limits in fasting, exposure to the elements and sacred medicines.  I was driven from my body time and time again to explore these bardo realms and experiences.  I developed a profound trust and confidence in not only my own capabilities but of the accuracy of the The Tibetan Book of the Dead.</p>
<p>It is my sincerest wish to produce a book that is not just visually beautiful, but also accurately depicts in a nonsectarian way the process that was laid out by the great Master Padmasambhava in the 8<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<p>As a father of 4 children, I have sought ways to communicate these deep teachings of Awareness and mind to them in ways they can understand.  It has also been a dream of mine to use the The Tibetan Book of the Dead as an inspiration for the communication of how to awaken in death for more people than just those interested in Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>The story features four young girls who are sisters. They will be represented by our four daughters. The girls try very hard to be fair and stand up for what is right. But they come to their mother/ mentor (Kyra) sad and frustrated that there is still so much suffering in the world. She teaches them that there can never be true peace until they find it within themselves first. She guides them through a visualization process that connects them to higher states of clarity and peace, until they finally recognize that these states have been within themselves all along. She then tells them it is her time to die. As she begins dying, she teaches them about the ""bardos"", which are the transition phases everyone experiences after death. She explains these bardos are merely reflections of one's own mind, and that as we journey through them, we have the opportunity to identify with the blazing brilliance of unrestricted wisdom and clarity, which is our true nature. Or, we can be lulled into the comfort of our familiar restrictive emotions of anger, passion, greed, and fear, and be reborn to experience them all over again. As she traverses through these bardos herself, she recognizes her true nature of absolute wisdom, and dissolves into a brilliant ""rainbow body"", where the flesh itself becomes so clarified by the recognition of truth it dissolves into rainbow light. Witnessing this, the girls themselves realize their own true nature, and are grateful for this final beautiful lesson from their mother/mentor. Our hope is that this can be a tool for others to change the narrative of fear of death to one of something beautiful and liberating.  </p>
<p>The artistic style in this series will be a combination of expressionism, abstract, and realism. We will be purposely excluding any traditional Buddhist symbolism and iconography specifically to maintain a more secular narrative that can speak to a Western audience. There will be mandalas in the paintings, but not shown in a traditionally eastern way. This series is meant to convey the teachings themselves, separate from the religious and cultural association they are typically represented in. </p>
<p>It is also very important to us that all these characters are female. As in all religions, Buddhism has had a very limited representation of women as teachers and wise figures. Representation matters!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our vision is that The Journey of the In-Between will become a tool people of all ages can use. As both of us are long-time students of Tibetan Buddhism, we recognize that these teachings are often presented with Tibetan cultural symbolism that can be confusing to a westerner. By bringing a human story to these teachings with a simple explanation, as well as a strong visual experience, our hope is that it will serve many for years to come. Art is a powerful tool for connecting with experiences beyond words. We hope this book can speak to all minds and hearts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Our Background</h3>
<p>Kyra has been an artist since she was 18 months old, no exaggeration! She studied at the Corcoran School of Art, and the Maryland Institute, College of Art. She became a full-time professional artist at the age of 21. At that time, she had a profound spiritual experience. She left everything behind and became a nun in a Hindu tradition, and lived that way for 3 years, doing deep spiritual practice and humanitarian work. At age 26, she realized the life of renunciation wasn't in alignment with her deepest spiritual experiences and left that world behind. She went on to study at Naropa University, which is a small Buddhist-inspired University in Boulder, Colorado that was founded by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche. It was there she dove deep into the Buddhist teachings, focusing on understanding the psychology of enlightenment. While studying there, she  worked as a caregiver in hospice and with the elderly. She helped many people die along the way, and learned much about human psychology in death. These experiences have deeply informed this project.</p>
<p>Kyra returned professionally in 2014 to the art world with a focus on spiritual and psychological expressions of women's empowerment. She  founded Infuse Gallery. This art gallery partnered with several women-focused nonprofits, and gave those served in the gallery a platform to sell their art. </p>
<p>Robert is originally from Topeka, Kansas.  Born smack in the middle of the country raised on a ranch he developed a keen connection with the earth and her animals.  A kundalini awakening at age 19 sent him in a profoundly different direction than he had been raised. He left for Naropa University a few years later and received a degree in Religious Studies. </p>
<p>Robert has studied with his Buddhist Teacher for 21 years, in addition he is an entrepreneur, a father to four young dakini’s, a partner and a friend to all beings. He loves creating mandala chalk art, and will be collaborating with Kyra on the paintings by adding in some of his geometric creations. Kyra and Robert will be co-writing the story together.</p>

As both of us are long-time students of Tibetan Buddhism, we recognize that these teachings are often presented with Tibetan cultural symbolism that can be confusing to a westerner. By bringing a human story to these teachings with a simple explanation, as well as a strong visual experience, our hope is that it will serve many for years to come. Art is a powerful tool for connecting with experiences beyond words. We hope this book can speak to all minds and hearts.

 
Our Background
Kyra has been an artist since she was 18 months old, no exaggeration! She studied at the Corcoran School of Art, and the Maryland Institute, College of Art. She became a full-time professional artist at the age of 21. At that time, she had a profound spiritual experience. She left everything behind and became a nun in a Hindu tradition, and lived that way for 3 years, doing deep spiritual practice and humanitarian work. At age 26, she realized the life of renunciation wasn't in alignment with her deepest spiritual experiences and left that world behind. She went on to study at Naropa University, which is a small Buddhist-inspired University in Boulder, Colorado that was founded by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche. It was there she dove deep into the Buddhist teachings, focusing on understanding the psychology of enlightenment. While studying there, she  worked as a caregiver in hospice and with the elderly. She helped many people die along the way, and learned much about human psychology in death. These experiences have deeply informed this project.
Kyra returned professionally in 2014 to the art world with a focus on spiritual and psychological expressions of women's empowerment. She  founded Infuse Gallery. This art gallery partnered with several women-focused nonprofits, and gave those served in the gallery a platform to sell their art. 
Robert is originally from Topeka, Kansas.  Born smack in the middle of the country raised on a ranch he developed a keen connection with the earth and her animals.  A kundalini awakening at age 19 sent him in a profoundly different direction than he had been raised. He left for Naropa University a few years later and received a degree in Religious Studies. 
Robert has studied with his Buddhist Teacher for 21 years, in addition he is an entrepreneur, a father to four young dakini’s, a partner and a friend to all beings. He loves creating mandala chalk art, and will be collaborating with Kyra on the paintings by adding in some of his geometric creations. Kyra and Robert will be co-writing the story together.

<h3>Why Women's History?</h3>
<p>As a kid, I loved learning about and sharing history. Seeing women in history books when I was a kid changed the course of my life; I realized I could be whomever I wanted, even if that wasn't who I was 'supposed' to be. I love to share that feeling with everyone I can, especially through art, my career and passion.</p>
<p><strong>Why 100 Women?</strong></p>
<p>In June of 2016, as Hillary Rodham Clinton took the stage as the first woman nominated by a major party for Presidential candidacy, the weight of history was overwhelming. It was a great night full of optimism, and I got to share it with so many people, but my mind was drawn to the countless number of influential women who'd been forgotten or left behind by common memory. There I was inspired to create the<strong> #100Days100Women</strong> series, where I drew a historical woman each day in the 100 days leading up to the 2016 election.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Through the 100 Days 100 Women series I was able to bring attention to forgotten (and a couple famous) women who've made history and changed lives. In 2017, with your help, we were able to print and distribute posters of the 100 Days 100 Women series <strong>all over the world</strong>. With immeasurable joy I got to see photos and hear stories of the fascinated, inspired kids and adults as they studied the faces of the amazing women.</p>
<p>Now, in 2018, I am asking for your help again. I want to go further in inspiring the minds and sparking the imaginations of kids and adults by funding a print run of a 100 Days 100 Women coloring book,<strong> complete with short biographies</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Why A Coloring Book?</strong></h3>

In addition, I'm opening a limited number of custom portraits where I will draw a woman of your choosing (please see below FAQ for details) and the option to turn your favorite woman into a printable, color-able illustration!</p>

Learning how to trust your own guidance is priceless.  And Intuition is a skill that you can learn and strengthen with practice.</p><p>It doesn't have to be hard. </p><p>Unlock the ancient power of the Tarot to gain a deep insight into your future, get clear guidance on major decisions and even reveal your life's true path.</p><p>In a world gone off track and now trying to get back on target, trusting your own gut instinct is a must.. it's a survival tool.</p><div>
<h3>What we are Creating</h3>
<p>During Covid, my work shifted, as did everyone’s.  I found myself somewhat lost and confused.  How do I change?  What changes do I need to make?</p>
<p>As an Energy healer and Spiritual Counselor, I am grateful that I have the tools to help me with these questions.  </p>
<p>And these were big questions I found myself as well as my clients asking.</p>
<p>And sure enough… out would come the Tarot Cards.  </p>
<p>One of the things I teach in my private mentoring is developing Intuition. One of the tools I use for this, is the Oracles and the Tarot.</p>
<p>In my private mentoring, I use the oracles and the Tarot as a way to access intuition and develop trust in your inner guidance. I truly believe that the more you access your intuition, the more it will grow. Using the Tarot teaches you how to look for the signs and symbols in your life. It will help you uncover hidden information for your life.</p>
<p>One day, I was speaking to one of may former clients, Lorri Hanna, an amazing and talented artist.  She said she had been looking for a spiritual art project and I said I wanted to create a Tarot deck.  Although she  had minimal experience with the Tarot and a little with oracle cards…. she was interested.</p>
<p>And thus we began the journey!</p>
<p>I guided.. She Illustrated, </p>
<p>This journey of the Empowered Spirit Tarot deck comes from a combination of the teachings of the Tarot and working with my client and in the Empowered Spirit Program.</p>
<p>The journey of the Spirit moves through all the elements of life and the major challenges we all go through.. from stepping out of your comfort zone and growing a business, trying new adventures to the ups and downs of life, the love, the loss, the abundance, the work.. the Empowered Spirit Tarot came to life.</p>
<p>Each of the images are original, yet based on the Tarot with its own unique elements to it.</p>
<p>While I recognize there are many Tarot decks already available, this deck offers, what I think, is a modern update and interpretation to working with the Spirit for your life.  The artwork is original, created in vibrant, whimsical, watercolor and ink inspired by the Empowered Spirit Program. The artwork was then photographed, digitally, to produce the cards</p>
<p>In a dismal and changing world, art always comes in to inspire the Spirit.</p>
<p>It’s important to me to inspire others in the Healings Arts and find ways to raise awareness of just how important creativity is to the Spirit.  </p>
<h3>Why the Tarot:</h3>
<p>Intuition emerges from the subconscious.  The subconscious can bypass the logical mind and ego. But the logical mind and ego can talk you out of believing in intuition.</p>
<p>The Tarot is storytelling.  It has a way to distract your logical mind with the story. While your logical mind is distracted, your subconscious mind and intuition are engaged.</p>
<p>With intention, you can take the process further and actually work with your Spirit, Source energy and Guides to further enhance your intuitive development.</p>
<p>The Tarot offers a foundation. It is set up with elements and brings in numerology, signs, symbols and  sacred geometry, in a way that allows your imagination to open so that you can look at your life with a different perspective.</p>
<p>Learn to unlock the ancient power of the Tarot to truly change your own life and the lives of those around you... FAST!</p>
<h3>Having a Tarot Reading is like have a therapy session with your Spirit!</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have our deck produced and off for the first prototypes.  We need this crowdfunding to help with the high cost of printing large quantities in high quality.</p>
<p>In exchange, we have some amazing perks for you to choose from including prints of the original artwork, 1st edition decks, Tarot readings, a journal, workbook, a Tarot class, Woo Circles and more.</p>
<p>Choose the perk that fits your excitement and help us bring this out into the world for others to be able to Empower their Spirit and learn to develop their Intuition. </p>
<p><strong>Note:  Each Empowered Spirit Tarot Deck includes a 98 page booklet to guide you through the cards.</strong></p>
<h3>Funding:</h3>
<p>Our budget is set with a goal of $7,777.  Why? Because 7's are spirituality.  7777 represents prosperity, success, and wisdom. It is brimming with abundance and will help those who are looking to build upon their wealth.  We need your help which in turn will help you as well. We need help with the printing cost associated with producing large quantities needed to print and package the cards to bring them out into the world at an affordable cost.  The funding will determine how many decks will be printed. </p>
<p>We will also use a portion of the funding to produce and print the Workbook and Journal that supplements the Empowered Spirit Tarot deck so that you can go even deeper in learning about your journey and how it relates to the journey through life.</p>
<p>Each and every dollar submitted, including shipping, will be added to our fundraising total! So if do you want to support us by purchasing more than one perk, you will have to do it multiple times.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In our society today, we are going through an evolutionary change. You can no longer ignore what is going on within.  Each of us must take responsibility for our path.</p>
<p>Stress and anxiety are prevalent and can wreak havoc on the body, mind and Spirit. </p>
<p>Having the tools and techniques to calm the mind, to ask the deeper questions and interpret the meanings is priceless.</p>
<p>The same 'ole searching out there just isn't working.</p>
<p><strong>Trusting your own gut instinct is a survival tool!</strong></p>
<p>The Tarot can help you to learn more, practice more and build that muscle up!</p>
<p>It’s time to Empower Your Spirit with the Tarot!</p>

You can no longer ignore what is going on within you and all the shifts and pivots around you.  Stress and anxiety are prevalent and wreak havoc on the body, mind and Spirit. Having the tools and techniques to get to the root causes and open up to your deeper yearning is what's needed. Learning how to trust your own guidance is priceless.  And Intuition is a skill that you can learn and strengthen with practice.It doesn't have to be hard. Unlock the ancient power of the Tarot to gain a deep insight into your future, get clear guidance on major decisions and even reveal your life's true path.In a world gone off track and now trying to get back on target, trusting your own gut instinct is a must.. it's a survival tool.
What we are Creating
During Covid, my work shifted, as did everyone’s.  I found myself somewhat lost and confused.  How do I change?  What changes do I need to make?
As an Energy healer and Spiritual Counselor, I am grateful that I have the tools to help me with these questions.  
And these were big questions I found myself as well as my clients asking.
And sure enough… out would come the Tarot Cards.  
One of the things I teach in my private mentoring is developing Intuition. One of the tools I use for this, is the Oracles and the Tarot.
In my private mentoring, I use the oracles and the Tarot as a way to access intuition and develop trust in your inner guidance. I truly believe that the more you access your intuition, the more it will grow. Using the Tarot teaches you how to look for the signs and symbols in your life. It will help you uncover hidden information for your life.
One day, I was speaking to one of may former clients, Lorri Hanna, an amazing and talented artist.  She said she had been looking for a spiritual art project and I said I wanted to create a Tarot deck.  Although she  had minimal experience with the Tarot and a little with oracle cards…. she was interested.
And thus we began the journey!
I guided.. She Illustrated, 
This journey of the Empowered Spirit Tarot deck comes from a combination of the teachings of the Tarot and working with my client and in the Empowered Spirit Program.
The journey of the Spirit moves through all the elements of life and the major challenges we all go through.. from stepping out of your comfort zone and growing a business, trying new adventures to the ups and downs of life, the love, the loss, the abundance, the work.. the Empowered Spirit Tarot came to life.
Each of the images are original, yet based on the Tarot with its own unique elements to it.
While I recognize there are many Tarot decks already available, this deck offers, what I think, is a modern update and interpretation to working with the Spirit for your life.  The artwork is original, created in vibrant, whimsical, watercolor and ink inspired by the Empowered Spirit Program. The artwork was then photographed, digitally, to produce the cards
In a dismal and changing world, art always comes in to inspire the Spirit.
It’s important to me to inspire others in the Healings Arts and find ways to raise awareness of just how important creativity is to the Spirit.  
Why the Tarot:
Intuition emerges from the subconscious.  The subconscious can bypass the logical mind and ego. But the logical mind and ego can talk you out of believing in intuition.
The Tarot is storytelling.  It has a way to distract your logical mind with the story. While your logical mind is distracted, your subconscious mind and intuition are engaged.
With intention, you can take the process further and actually work with your Spirit, Source energy and Guides to further enhance your intuitive development.
The Tarot offers a foundation. It is set up with elements and brings in numerology, signs, symbols and  sacred geometry, in a way that allows your imagination to open so that you can look at your life with a different perspective.
Learn to unlock the ancient power of the Tarot to truly change your own life and the lives of those around you... FAST!
Having a Tarot Reading is like have a therapy session with your Spirit!
 

What We Need
We have our deck produced and off for the first prototypes.  We need this crowdfunding to help with the high cost of printing large quantities in high quality.
In exchange, we have some amazing perks for you to choose from including prints of the original artwork, 1st edition decks, Tarot readings, a journal, workbook, a Tarot class, Woo Circles and more.
Choose the perk that fits your excitement and help us bring this out into the world for others to be able to Empower their Spirit and learn to develop their Intuition. 
Note:  Each Empowered Spirit Tarot Deck includes a 98 page booklet to guide you through the cards.
Funding:
Our budget is set with a goal of $7,777.  Why? Because 7's are spirituality.  7777 represents prosperity, success, and wisdom. It is brimming with abundance and will help those who are looking to build upon their wealth.  We need your help which in turn will help you as well. We need help with the printing cost associated with producing large quantities needed to print and package the cards to bring them out into the world at an affordable cost.  The funding will determine how many decks will be printed. 
We will also use a portion of the funding to produce and print the Workbook and Journal that supplements the Empowered Spirit Tarot deck so that you can go even deeper in learning about your journey and how it relates to the journey through life.
Each and every dollar submitted, including shipping, will be added to our fundraising total! So if do you want to support us by purchasing more than one perk, you will have to do it multiple times.

The Impact
In our society today, we are going through an evolutionary change. You can no longer ignore what is going on within.  Each of us must take responsibility for our path.
Stress and anxiety are prevalent and can wreak havoc on the body, mind and Spirit. 
Having the tools and techniques to calm the mind, to ask the deeper questions and interpret the meanings is priceless.
The same 'ole searching out there just isn't working.
Trusting your own gut instinct is a survival tool!
The Tarot can help you to learn more, practice more and build that muscle up!
It’s time to Empower Your Spirit with the Tarot!

I successfully crowd-sourced funds to publish <u>12 Owls</u> in 2017, and a third picturebook, <u>The Nautilus and the Ammonite</u> (edition of 300) in 2018.

<p><strong>We’re celebrating a special language from our parallel universe by making cookie cutters <i>and</i> the first dictionary of these words.  But we need your help to do this.  Baking is one of those wonderful family and community activities that's been around for a long time for all linear humans. <i>And these shape words are a lot of fun too!</i>  Please join us on the journey of inviting folks to look at the world in new ways. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606156595/iqxuooy99qosjj01mxvh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>For 17 years, we’ve been installing a parallel universe story (actually many interlocking stories) with the incredible support of communities around the world.  Many of you are already part of this community—and we thank you so much for that.  <i>And</i> we hope you will find this a happy extension of the project.  And, for those who are newer to these stories, we hope when you join us in this endeavor, you'll enjoy being part of this wonderful community.</strong></p>
<p>For those that don't know all this yet—Kcymaerxthaere (pronounced ""ky-MAER-icks-theer"") is a parallel universe that coexists to a certain degree with our own—and it <i>isn't</i> virtual! It's also a global installation art project, with 142 storytelling sites that you can actually visit in 30 nations— so far! Each installation site honors events from the parallel world in our world. Most include written stories (in bronze, concrete and stone usually)—but it is not only what is written but where you experience reading the story (and, often, the forms that help tell it). Some installations are fairly elaborate—two are actually buildings, another is a couple hundred yards long.  This article does a great job of explaining it: <u><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20190819-a-bizarre-journey-beyond-earths-borders"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Bizarre Journey Beyond Earth’s Borders</a></u>. To explore more of the details of Kcymaerxthaere, visit <a href=""http://www.kcymaerxthaere.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our homepage</a>.</p>
<p><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606082771/pf0b68cixnx4qwgnqwcg.jpg"" src=""""/></u></p>
<p>This year—which needless to say has been quite difficult and unique—we are trying something new here at KcyCentral. Due to those many widely-known constraints, installations are proceeding very slowly. But—we're embracing this time in a very sweet way: <strong><i>we are launching our very first limited edition Kcy Cookie Cutters! </i></strong> We hope they will be fun for all . . . what's more, they also will introduce still more folks to shapes and forms of the language known as Beshwa Nyelvate.  This takes us towards a much larger goal (and preparing for our grandest project to date, which we'll elaborate on momentarily).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606156651/avtgkh2t4ipe0vph8vha.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The process towards that goal (making Kcy cookie cutters and <i>sharing them with you</i>!) and the end-goal itself are two sides of the same coin: <u><i>celebrating the Nyelvate shape language.</i></u> We hope to share that joy with our community and beyond—and spread it through the shared love of baking.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606156673/zctoptj8xobutvgumvd4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>
<strong>But wait</strong>—<strong>what is ""Nyelvate""? And what are shapewords?</strong>
</h3>
<p>The<a href=""https://kcymaerxthaere.com/shape-glossary/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Nyelvate language</a>, often referred to as a shape language, requires that the speaker create shapes (words) that have 12 to 16 dimensions at once (through a process called <i>psycheforming</i>; so instead of uttering syllables verbally, words are created through the manifestation of physical shapes with one's own mind). Since not every <i>rezhn</i> has the same dimensions, a pidgin Nyelvate has developed usually requiring only 2 - 5 dimensions. This dialect is known as Beshwa Nyelvate. The cookies you make with your exclusive Kcymaerxthaere cookie cutters are a delectable sub-dialect of their own!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605989288/gvf60p2sczxfiarys2fq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>So what is our end-goal? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Two-Fold:</strong></p>
<p><strong>First:</strong> <strong>We want you to have fun with the Cookie Cutters</strong> and make your own messages (and post your favorites)!  And if you are a collector?  We want you to have one of the only Limited Edition Cookie Cutters we've ever heard of.  It is limited by time--the first edition of these shapes stops being made around February 14, 2021.  </p>
<p><strong>Second: We want publish a dictionary of over 400 Nyelvate shapewords</strong>—and creating this extensive publication <i><u>necessitates your help</u></i>. 2021 is when the Nyelvate language takes a larger role in the stories than ever before, and we want to have that dictionary done in time for the installation of <a href=""https://kcymaerxthaere.com/story/the-great-tenderness/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Great Tenderness</i></a> in the Northern Atlantic (spanning about 1,200 miles—see the map below).  There is also trekking between shapeword-based installations in Nepal (see one that already exists there: <a href=""https://kcymaerxthaere.com/historicalsite/%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE-%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A3%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%82-strands-of-thought/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Strands of Thought</i></a>, in Solukhumbu). </p>

<p>The beginnings of <i>The Great Tenderness</i> have already begun to take shape (pun intended!) with an introductory marker placed in Madeira, Portugal: <a href=""https://kcymaerxthaere.com/marker/origem-da-ternura-where-tenderness-began/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Where Tenderness Began (Origem da Ternura).</i></a> However, installation of the seven-pointed constellation spanning from Lisbon to the Azores to the deep seas of the Northern Atlantic has yet to begin. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>SO, what we need is your help bringing these words out into the world--in both edible and readable form.  If we meet our goal, we'll be able to publish our Nyelvate Shape Language dictionary by next Summer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What you get: </strong>In the end, of course you get what we think are pretty nifty perks.  But even if you don't order the book as a perk,  by supporting our campaign at any level, you too will have your name included in the credits section of the BPDBN (The Baker-Physicist's Dictionary of Beshwa Nyelvate--and receive one (if you choose that kind of perk)! </p>
<p>We’ll also distribute this book across the globe to the Kcymaerxthaere host communities that have made many of the physical installations happen.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606083132/jgyydvo1bxezc5r9ef6j.jpg"" src=""""/><p>That's because it is part of the spirit of the project to enrich the connective tissue between our various communities.  And while our website can be part of such enjoyment, something more tactile like a book in each community is critical (and, besides, not everyone has fast internet!)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606082992/tvhw6hklbplhxhrguzgc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What we are offering you is a chance to make some very eloquent cookies during the end of year holidays and, if you choose, to get your own copy of the first edition, signed (and further ornamented a bit for this campaign) by the author.  And, as we said before, you will be acknowledged by name for your support.</strong>  You'll have a personalized first edition of the first book to let you really explore this evocative language from the parallel world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks are the risks of the world today--disruption of the pandemic, the vulnerability of anyone to COVID-19, fragility in general.  Such things could stop the campaign or fulfillment in its tracks.</p>
<p>Within that framework, however, we have developed a good team for the Cookie Cutters and fulfillment, so we are confident the orders will be fulfilled. The Cookie Cutter maker does an excellent job with the shapes.  As for the book, we have already gathered the data and have a skilled printer that we have worked with before.  If the campaign only sells a small number of books, we will digitally print whatever books are required to fulfill our obligations (and those will be super rare!).</p>
<p>Also: the Cookie Cutters are not for Children under 3 and should be used with Adult Supervision.</p>

For those that don't know all this yet—Kcymaerxthaere (pronounced ""ky-MAER-icks-theer"") is a parallel universe that coexists to a certain degree with our own—and it isn't virtual! It's also a global installation art project, with 142 storytelling sites that you can actually visit in 30 nations— so far! Each installation site honors events from the parallel world in our world. Most include written stories (in bronze, concrete and stone usually)—but it is not only what is written but where you experience reading the story (and, often, the forms that help tell it). Some installations are fairly elaborate—two are actually buildings, another is a couple hundred yards long.  This article does a great job of explaining it: A Bizarre Journey Beyond Earth’s Borders. To explore more of the details of Kcymaerxthaere, visit our homepage.

This year—which needless to say has been quite difficult and unique—we are trying something new here at KcyCentral. Due to those many widely-known constraints, installations are proceeding very slowly. But—we're embracing this time in a very sweet way: we are launching our very first limited edition Kcy Cookie Cutters!  We hope they will be fun for all . . . what's more, they also will introduce still more folks to shapes and forms of the language known as Beshwa Nyelvate.  This takes us towards a much larger goal (and preparing for our grandest project to date, which we'll elaborate on momentarily).

The process towards that goal (making Kcy cookie cutters and sharing them with you!) and the end-goal itself are two sides of the same coin: celebrating the Nyelvate shape language. We hope to share that joy with our community and beyond—and spread it through the shared love of baking.


But wait—what is ""Nyelvate""? And what are shapewords?

The Nyelvate language, often referred to as a shape language, requires that the speaker create shapes (words) that have 12 to 16 dimensions at once (through a process called psycheforming; so instead of uttering syllables verbally, words are created through the manifestation of physical shapes with one's own mind). Since not every rezhn has the same dimensions, a pidgin Nyelvate has developed usually requiring only 2 - 5 dimensions. This dialect is known as Beshwa Nyelvate. The cookies you make with your exclusive Kcymaerxthaere cookie cutters are a delectable sub-dialect of their own!

So what is our end-goal? 
Two-Fold:
First: We want you to have fun with the Cookie Cutters and make your own messages (and post your favorites)!  And if you are a collector?  We want you to have one of the only Limited Edition Cookie Cutters we've ever heard of.  It is limited by time--the first edition of these shapes stops being made around February 14, 2021.  
Second: We want publish a dictionary of over 400 Nyelvate shapewords—and creating this extensive publication necessitates your help. 2021 is when the Nyelvate language takes a larger role in the stories than ever before, and we want to have that dictionary done in time for the installation of The Great Tenderness in the Northern Atlantic (spanning about 1,200 miles—see the map below).  There is also trekking between shapeword-based installations in Nepal (see one that already exists there: Strands of Thought, in Solukhumbu). 


The beginnings of The Great Tenderness have already begun to take shape (pun intended!) with an introductory marker placed in Madeira, Portugal: Where Tenderness Began (Origem da Ternura). However, installation of the seven-pointed constellation spanning from Lisbon to the Azores to the deep seas of the Northern Atlantic has yet to begin. 


What We Need & What You Get
SO, what we need is your help bringing these words out into the world--in both edible and readable form.  If we meet our goal, we'll be able to publish our Nyelvate Shape Language dictionary by next Summer.
What you get: In the end, of course you get what we think are pretty nifty perks.  But even if you don't order the book as a perk,  by supporting our campaign at any level, you too will have your name included in the credits section of the BPDBN (The Baker-Physicist's Dictionary of Beshwa Nyelvate--and receive one (if you choose that kind of perk)! 
We’ll also distribute this book across the globe to the Kcymaerxthaere host communities that have made many of the physical installations happen.
That's because it is part of the spirit of the project to enrich the connective tissue between our various communities.  And while our website can be part of such enjoyment, something more tactile like a book in each community is critical (and, besides, not everyone has fast internet!)

What we are offering you is a chance to make some very eloquent cookies during the end of year holidays and, if you choose, to get your own copy of the first edition, signed (and further ornamented a bit for this campaign) by the author.  And, as we said before, you will be acknowledged by name for your support.  You'll have a personalized first edition of the first book to let you really explore this evocative language from the parallel world.

Risks & Challenges
The risks are the risks of the world today--disruption of the pandemic, the vulnerability of anyone to COVID-19, fragility in general.  Such things could stop the campaign or fulfillment in its tracks.
Within that framework, however, we have developed a good team for the Cookie Cutters and fulfillment, so we are confident the orders will be fulfilled. The Cookie Cutter maker does an excellent job with the shapes.  As for the book, we have already gathered the data and have a skilled printer that we have worked with before.  If the campaign only sells a small number of books, we will digitally print whatever books are required to fulfill our obligations (and those will be super rare!).
Also: the Cookie Cutters are not for Children under 3 and should be used with Adult Supervision.

Other Ways You Can Help
If this is not a good time to contribute to our campaign, please help us reach others by sharing our Indiegogo link with friends or using IndieGoGo share tools to help us spread the word on your social media and blog platforms! Every bit counts and helps us as we try to reach our goal!  
But most of all tell people what we are doing!
Instagram: @kcymaerxthaereFacebook: @KcymaerxthaereTwitter: @kcymWHAT IF WE RAISE EXTRA MONEY?After the shapeword dictionary is published, we still have the actual installations to complete. The project that spans 1,200 miles across—The Great Tenderness—is going to require a lot of time and resources. So any funds raised above our goal will go towards installation expenses.THANKS SO MUCH!!! For checking out our campaign, we are so proud of what we have accomplished so far, appreciative of all the help we have gotten, and committed to being sure communities around the world experience communal connection through Kcymaerxthaereal storytelling, with the deep, simple joy of baking!We are creating a global connection through story.  Please help—and follow the updates for other ways you can experience the stories.Don’t hesitate to post or email questions.And please spread the word--especially on Facebook and Instagram.Shóaf Kepl Poets,Eames DemetriosGeographer-at-Large",11.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>We Must Be Proud</i> is a 30+ page collaborative digital charity zine featuring the works of 12 dedicated artists, aiming to donate money to Trans and LGBTQ+ Nonprofits and Organizations during Pride Month.</p>
<p>As Pride celebrations were cancelled following the global pandemic, many organizations were hindered in their ability to perform advocacy and provide material resources to LGBTQ+ folks. Our team decided we wanted to find a way to give back to our community through art!</p>
<p>Each of the twelve artists collaborated to create a total of 30+ stunning pages of artwork commemorating the full spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities, as well as paying homage to the incredibly diverse and profound representation in SheRa and the Princesses Of Power!!</p>
<p>All collaborators believe it is a zine in equal parts dedicated to helping LGBTQ+ folks, and a love letter to everyone who worked tirelessly to make television history with SheRa.</p>
<p><br/><i>By contributing to this campaign,</i> you are not only supporting LGBTQ+ artists, you are directly donating valuable money and resources to Queer and Trans folks who are affected by the pandemic and need help year-round. Help us celebrate the accomplishments of this momentous show and stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ Community. The festivities may be cancelled, but Pride is all-year-round!!</p>

We Must Be Proud is a 30+ page collaborative digital charity zine featuring the works of 12 dedicated artists, aiming to donate money to Trans and LGBTQ+ Nonprofits and Organizations during Pride Month.
As Pride celebrations were cancelled following the global pandemic, many organizations were hindered in their ability to perform advocacy and provide material resources to LGBTQ+ folks. Our team decided we wanted to find a way to give back to our community through art!
Each of the twelve artists collaborated to create a total of 30+ stunning pages of artwork commemorating the full spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities, as well as paying homage to the incredibly diverse and profound representation in SheRa and the Princesses Of Power!!
All collaborators believe it is a zine in equal parts dedicated to helping LGBTQ+ folks, and a love letter to everyone who worked tirelessly to make television history with SheRa.
By contributing to this campaign, you are not only supporting LGBTQ+ artists, you are directly donating valuable money and resources to Queer and Trans folks who are affected by the pandemic and need help year-round. Help us celebrate the accomplishments of this momentous show and stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ Community. The festivities may be cancelled, but Pride is all-year-round!!

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Martha Knox, a woodblock printmaker, teaching artist, and sole proprietor of Words On Woodcuts Press. I trained at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and maintain a studio in Philadelphia. <br/><br/>This is a pre-sale campaign for my latest project: 12 Owls. The project is a series of linoleum cut prints of 12 different owl species, offered in 3 forms: </p>

<li>Black and white versions of all 12 prints reproduced as a 8.5"" x 11"" coloring book </li>
<li>Full color 12"" x 12"" 2018 calendars featuring all 12 prints </li>
<li>Original artwork - pick and choose your favorite prints, in black and white or hand-colored</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE: <i>All orders will be filled by the first week of December in time for holiday gift giving. </i></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Printing even a small edition of calendars and coloring books costs a lot. Not to mention all the paper, ink, and blocks I go through creating the original artwork in my studio. By running these pre-sale campaigns, I raise most or all of the material costs for these projects up front. Without enough up-front capital, I cannot do bulk publishing of projects such as 12 Owls, and without bulk publishing, I cannot keep my prices competitive. <br/><br/>By ordering during the pre-sale campaign, fans of my artwork get special perks, such as signed copies, discounts on original artwork, and receiving the work before anyone else. ​</p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>I am no stranger to crowdfunding. Two years ago I founded Words On Woodcuts Press with an Indiegogo fundraising campaign that raised nearly $4,000 (198% of its original goal.) In less than a year I collected the seed funds to publish my first two books (each in editions of 500) through successful pre-sale campaigns and crowd-sourced small business loans (loans now paid back in full.) Earlier this year I ran a successful pre-sale campaign to create an edition of 100 of my press's first handmade book ""A Wise Old Owl."" I know fundraising is a lot of work, but also a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I'm so grateful to all the family, friends, colleagues, and collectors of my work who have supported all my past endeavors and given me the confidence to not only maintain my studio practice, but also get my work out to a broader audience. Thank you, all!</p>

Not only physically but also mentally and spiritually as well. </p><p>I began my journey and came across tarot a few years ago, that was when my interest in spiritual path grew. Normally when my energy is low I naturally bring myself near the body of water. Watching the waves crashing the shores and the horizon of the sea meets the sky like they have magical power to calm and to heal.<br/>But if I was not near the ocean, I would paint.<br/>I have been a professional illustrator for more than 10 years. I do art digitally and traditionally. I can say I perform well on both. But my favourite method is always watercolor.</p><p>In water color painting, you can not rush, you cannot be too slow. It has its timing when things will workout as we work on it, and the time it will work on itself like magic. It helps me be in the moments, observe and feel the power of creativity. </p><p>For that reason I decided to create a project that focuses on the healing aspects of all those elements combined. To paint 78 tarot cards illustrations in the theme of oceans and natures in watercolor painting.

Not only physically but also mentally and spiritually as well. I began my journey and came across tarot a few years ago, that was when my interest in spiritual path grew. Normally when my energy is low I naturally bring myself near the body of water. Watching the waves crashing the shores and the horizon of the sea meets the sky like they have magical power to calm and to heal.But if I was not near the ocean, I would paint.I have been a professional illustrator for more than 10 years. I do art digitally and traditionally. I can say I perform well on both. But my favourite method is always watercolor.In water color painting, you can not rush, you cannot be too slow. It has its timing when things will workout as we work on it, and the time it will work on itself like magic. It helps me be in the moments, observe and feel the power of creativity. For that reason I decided to create a project that focuses on the healing aspects of all those elements combined. To paint 78 tarot cards illustrations in the theme of oceans and natures in watercolor painting. But instead of using tap water, I used the water collected from the ocean directly as my painting medium. As we know, the effect of salt water with watercolor will be different from normal water and it’s something I enjoy exploring.  This deck is not only made as the artist’s collection tarot, but also created with an intention to help us explore the depth of their soul, to reflect, to heal. About the deckThe healing waves tarot deck is based on the traditional Rider-Waite Smith messages.The deck will be printed in full colored, round cornered, 7cm x 12 cm cards with a small paper handbook in the box. The deck will contained 78 cards, 22 Major arcana and 56 Minor arcanaCardstock will be 330gsm smooth Germany black core paper with matte laminate coating.The illustration on the cards will be painted with watercolor, using water that I collected from the ocean as a medium with an intention to combine the healing aspect of mother nature and art into artwork.

The earth for the pentacle suit, the fire for the wands/staves suit, the air for the sword suit and the water for the cup suit. They're represented by sea life and animal of the ocean, AND some mermaids (or divers) :DThey are mostly using the narrative and scheme from RWS, that they're easy for the reader to read. For the court cards they are represented by the creatures also, For example the albatross for the king of sword, sea salamander for the knight of wands. The Energy of the Healing Wave tarot deckThe deck was fully created with intentions of healing, for the creator herself and also for others as water color is also one of the most popular methods in art therapy as well. With the light, calming and refreshing tone of watercolor pictures and natural looking of the illustrations the energy will toward soothing sides and the silver lining in the dark situations.     As well as the depth of the ocean I wish the users can use the deck as a navigator to explore the depth of their mind and soul, as when they’re facing big waves, storms and also discover their pearls.   RewardsPlease check the perks for the rewards such asThe custom made pendulum The tin box for the treasure chest package The premium design velvet bag for cards.Goal As a professional illustrator myself.

<h3>Mighty Impressions for Strange Times</h3>
<p>What I do isn't fancy – I put ink on letters and press them into paper. I believe that letterpress printing has immense power to tell stories, start conversation, spark movements, and empower people. <br/><br/>That's why at the start of the pandemic, I launched a weekly letterpress-printed newspaper, featuring stories of 10 words or less submitted by YOU. Each story, ad, and feature was set by hand, letter by letter, from antique metal type. </p>
<p>Now, for the first time, every issue of the New Day newspaper will be meticulously scanned, printed and bound into a book, taking these ephemeral stories and making a lasting keepsake. The book will also include extensive behind-the-scenes images of the making of the newspaper, and stories on how they came to be. The limited First Edition will include a letterpress-printed cover. The guts of the book will be printed by Smart Set, a union print shop in Northeast Minneapolis that is dedicated to operating as a values-driven small business.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>I would like to print a first edition of 250 copies. The costs for this include time and labor in scanning, design, and writing, as well as the printing costs. Books will be printed and bound by the union shop Smart Set in Northeast Minneapolis, and with the cover designed and printed by me at Fontlove Studio using antique type.</li>
<li>You will get a copy of this first edition! There are other awesome stretch pledge opportunities, too.</li>
<li>If I don't reach the entire goal, the funds raised will still go to offsetting the costs of production. The book will be printed and produced regardless of reaching the goal, but I deeply appreciate your support so I don't have to go into the hole to do it!</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am committed to this project, but I can foresee a few challenges: one is that I am moving my studio in early March, which may take up a lot of my time and cause delays in the design process. Also, I am a parent of young kids in a pandemic, so everything takes me longer than I think it will. That said, I can't imagine a delay of longer than a month or two to complete production.</p>
<p> </p>

The book will also include extensive behind-the-scenes images of the making of the newspaper, and stories on how they came to be. The limited First Edition will include a letterpress-printed cover. The guts of the book will be printed by Smart Set, a union print shop in Northeast Minneapolis that is dedicated to operating as a values-driven small business.
What We Need & What You Get

I would like to print a first edition of 250 copies. The costs for this include time and labor in scanning, design, and writing, as well as the printing costs. Books will be printed and bound by the union shop Smart Set in Northeast Minneapolis, and with the cover designed and printed by me at Fontlove Studio using antique type.
You will get a copy of this first edition! There are other awesome stretch pledge opportunities, too.
If I don't reach the entire goal, the funds raised will still go to offsetting the costs of production. The book will be printed and produced regardless of reaching the goal, but I deeply appreciate your support so I don't have to go into the hole to do it!

Risks & Challenges
I am committed to this project, but I can foresee a few challenges: one is that I am moving my studio in early March, which may take up a lot of my time and cause delays in the design process. Also, I am a parent of young kids in a pandemic, so everything takes me longer than I think it will. That said, I can't imagine a delay of longer than a month or two to complete production.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>  The monochrome version of the Crowley tarot was well received and I decided that it could be enhanced with colours, so I spent a great many hours colouring the images in a way that reflected the old hand tinted photos from the era that the deck recalls.</p>
<p>Unlike the Thoth Tarot that was created by Aleister Crowly, this deck uses the Rider Smith Waite standard of divination. The images on the cards represent a number of individuals who were associated with the rising popularity of occultism during Crowley's time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The deck arrives in a sturdy two part box with a durable glossy finish, and the first 78 pledges will receive a ltd. edition Hermit card. The cards are printed on beautiful 120 weight stock and measure the standard 2.75"" X 4.75"" size.</p>
<p>THE FIRST 78 PLEDGES WILL RECIEVE A RANDOMLY DRAWN GLOSSY CARD FROM A SINGLE DECK. (Which card will you receive and what will it tell you?}</p>

<br/><strong>About Our Project</strong>
</h3><p>The 2020 class of Master of Fine Arts cohort from Pratt Institute is organizing an exhibition entitled Emergent Poise. As Covid19 descended on NYC, our final thesis year was abruptly dismantled just as our thesis shows were about to debut. All shows were canceled, and, as a cohort, we were forced to withdraw from our studios and shelter in place, along with the community at large.</p><p>As this new reality settled in, we adjusted our approaches, found new spaces and working methods, and worked through the disappointment and heartache. We found our focus sharpened and distilled, remaining poised to make our move. We are now gathering together to launch a group showcase of the work of the class of 2020. The exhibition will include our thesis work and show how our individual practices have responded in this emergent world.  </p><p>We are raising funds to help us realize this exhibition and reaching out to ask for your help. As the world shut down, we all turned to the arts to offer perspective, comfort, and relief during this crucial time. Our strength has always been in our diversity and our earnestness toward our explorations, and we are asking for your support as we continue the conversation.<br/><br/>We’ve currently confirmed our bookings with <i>Culture Lab LIC at Plaxall Gallery</i> and <i>On Canal by Wallplay</i>; utilizing both spaces simultaneously will allow us to show all of our artists' works together at the same time. <br/><br/>We will be paying for the rent, printing a simple catalogue, installing exhibition wall text and labels, building a temporary wall as the main costs for our show. We will also have transportation costs to rent vehicles, as we will be transporting and installing all participating artists’ work ourselves. <strong>Our goal is to raise $5,925</strong>, and we are accepting donations via IndieGoGo. You can find the campaign details on this page and see the original artworks our artists have donated as gifts in return for your generous contributions. We are thrilled to be bringing this show to fruition.</p><p>With much gratitude,<br/>-Pratt Institute MFA Cohort of 2020</p><h3>

About Our Project
The 2020 class of Master of Fine Arts cohort from Pratt Institute is organizing an exhibition entitled Emergent Poise. As Covid19 descended on NYC, our final thesis year was abruptly dismantled just as our thesis shows were about to debut. All shows were canceled, and, as a cohort, we were forced to withdraw from our studios and shelter in place, along with the community at large.As this new reality settled in, we adjusted our approaches, found new spaces and working methods, and worked through the disappointment and heartache. We found our focus sharpened and distilled, remaining poised to make our move. We are now gathering together to launch a group showcase of the work of the class of 2020. The exhibition will include our thesis work and show how our individual practices have responded in this emergent world.  We are raising funds to help us realize this exhibition and reaching out to ask for your help. As the world shut down, we all turned to the arts to offer perspective, comfort, and relief during this crucial time. Our strength has always been in our diversity and our earnestness toward our explorations, and we are asking for your support as we continue the conversation.We’ve currently confirmed our bookings with Culture Lab LIC at Plaxall Gallery and On Canal by Wallplay; utilizing both spaces simultaneously will allow us to show all of our artists' works together at the same time. We will be paying for the rent, printing a simple catalogue, installing exhibition wall text and labels, building a temporary wall as the main costs for our show. We will also have transportation costs to rent vehicles, as we will be transporting and installing all participating artists’ work ourselves. Our goal is to raise $5,925, and we are accepting donations via IndieGoGo. You can find the campaign details on this page and see the original artworks our artists have donated as gifts in return for your generous contributions. We are thrilled to be bringing this show to fruition.With much gratitude,-Pratt Institute MFA Cohort of 2020

<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges</div></div><p style=""text-align: left;"">While we have worked tirelessly building and refining our prototypes, there are also risks associated with backing a crowdfunding campaign.</p><p style=""text-align: left;"">Our working prototypes are being refined to a sleeker form factor. This requires additional engineering work. Given our ability to rapidly prototype and test products quickly in the field to improve the Nailbot, we are confident that we can transform our works like prototype to a stylish Nailbot. But we must execute quickly to meet the ship dates that we have proposed.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><i><b>Manufacturing &amp; QA</b></i><br/>We spent January to May 2015 in Shenzhen, China making sure that we had a solid understanding of how to manufacture the Nailbot. We visited numerous factories, shortlisted contract manufacturers and researched how to design the next iterations of our prototypes for manufacturing. We plan on spending a significant amount of time in China again as we manufacture the Nailbot in 2016.<br/>We have an outstanding manufacturing support system with our hardware accelerator, HAX, and numerous hardware advisors (from companies like Cisco &amp; iRobot) with experience shipping millions of units of consumer electronics and complex consumer robotics products.</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><i><b>Formulation in Consumables</b></i><br/>We are testing different formulations in our cartridges and polishes. While we expect to have this finalized in the coming weeks, there are third party certifications that we must meet to ship a cosmetic product both within the United States and internationally. Pree has personally attended a cosmetic and drug safety training over the summer and we will be working with specialist with decades of experience in personal care regulations moving forward.</p><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>Product</b></p>
<p><b>Is the Nailbot Safe?</b></p>
<p>We have spent years working on various designs to ensure a safe product for our nieces, daughters, girlfriends and community. We are also finalizing our formulation and ink sourcing. We will be doing significant safety testing on the device before shipping and may seek a voluntary third party certification on the entire system.</p>
<p><b>How long do the Nailbot prints last?</b></p>
<p>They will last a few days - you do need to put a top coat to seal the image. We find that the traditional nail polish underneath will chip first before the prints actually fade.</p>
<p><b>How do I remove the Nailbot prints?</b></p>
<p>You can remove the prints with traditional nail polish remover or remover pads. We will also offer these on our website in time.</p>
<p><b>What happens if it prints on my skin or my daughter's skin?</b></p>
<p>We are working extensively on our accuracy - but you can remove with traditional nail polish remover or wipes. </p>
<p><b>Do you use Bluetooth and/or WiFi to connect your phone to the Nailbot?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Prototypes built have used both. In the video, we use WiFi. Beta Units will use WiFi.</p>
<p><b>What resolution is possible with the Nailbot? </b></p>
<p>The resolution of the Nailbot is the same as traditional thermal inkjet products and can reach up to 1200 dpi. Note: While it can print with this resolution, the effective resolution for the Nailbot application will likely be less due to spacing constraints.</p>
<p><b>How is computer vision integrated? </b></p>
<p>Preemadonna has already proven our ability to develop and use computer vision in our products. Our first prototype, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyg_WAivbWY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gracie</a>, was able to use the front facing camera to capture a picture of the nail and find the edges. Preemadonna's augmented reality app, which we are releasing, finds the edges of the nail in near real time using your smartphone’s camera to appropriately place the graphic onto the nail. For this Nailbot offered on Indiegogo, we will combine the computer vision functions of our augmented reality app with the printing functions to be able to automatically size the art to fit each user's nail size.</p>
<p><b>What kind of cradle or case is my phone sitting in when using the Nailbot? </b></p>
<p>The Final Nailbot for shipping will have adjustable cradle that is safe for your phone. And many girls have asked that we create mobile phone cases with the Preemadonna logo on it - so yes, those will come in time too. Make sure you keep tabs on our website.</p>
<p><b>What if I have small or big fingers or fingernails? </b></p>
<p>The cradle can accommodate most fingers/fingernails of girls. We use your phone's back facing camera and advanced computer vision algorithms to detect your fingernail - so we will be able to size your fingernail accurately!</p>
<p><b>Will the Nailbot paint my full nail with the white nail polish and pre-print polish automatically? </b></p>
<p>Not yet. We are working on a Nailbot that automates the 'polish change' - but it is not ready for shipment or orders. But we know this is what many women want!</p>
<p><b>Will I have to replace the cartridge? </b></p>
<p>The cartridge should last for over 5000 manicures (imagine 10 nails with 10 different images/art = 1 manicure). Should you mishandle the Nailbot or not use it for months (the ink may dry), then you will want to purchase a new cartridge which will be available on our website/app. However, it may be more beneficial to just upgrade the Nailbot when that happens.</p>
<p><b>Is the Nailbot Beta Unit  Battery operated? </b></p>
<p>That is the current plan for official Nailbot units down the road. However, this requires added development and our current prototypes do not have this feature. Our Beta Units will very likely NOT be battery operated and require a electrical plug outlet.</p>
<p><b>Timing &amp; Shipping</b></p>
<p><b>Will it be available sooner? Do I really have to wait? </b></p>
<p>We know this is a long time to wait, but we prefer to be transparent with our backers. We WILL be hosting events through Ambassadors, Community Partners and Maker Faires, all across the United States in 2016 with a limited number of working Nailbots. Our App will also be released earlier for you to start discovering, creating and sharing cool nail art. If you can't wait for that long, buy Maker Kit and program a DIY printer!</p>
<p><b>Preemadonna is a global nation! When will you ship the Nailbot outside the United States?</b></p>
<p>Soon! There are additional certifications and requirements we must meet before shipping the Nailbot outside the United States. If the response is positive in the U.S., we will open up future campaigns to certain international regions.</p>
<p><b>The Nailbot is too expensive for me - will this be cheaper soon? </b></p>
<p>It's much more affordable to get the Nailbot on Indiegogo NOW with major discounts as the retail regular price of the Nailbot is $299 - our early backers reap rewards for supporting us early with beta units.</p>
<p>We need to stand by a pricepoint in our early days that allows us to buy inventory, continue building our team and shipping product.</p>
<p><b>How long have you been working on the Nailbot? </b></p>
<p>Pree had the idea in 2012 and we started working on it full time in January 2013.</p>
<p><b>Do you have intellectual property filed on the Nailbot? </b></p>
<p>Yes. We have patent filings on the entire Nailbot Product Family dating back to 2013.</p>
<p><b>Community</b></p>
<p><b>What is the Preemadonna Ambassador Program? </b></p>
<p>Our <a href=""http://www.preemadonna.com/who_runs_the_world"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ambassador program</a> is a way to incorporate our pre-teen and teen supporters into our company and movement. Our Ambassadors are signing up as Hackers, Artists and Social Bees - our program and offerings are serious fun.</p>
<p><b>Who do you see using the Nailbot the most? </b></p>
<p>Girls LOVE the Nailbot. But really anyone that thinks art and tech are cool will get a kick out of the Nailbot.</p>
<p><b>Have you tested any of your prototypes on people?</b></p>
<p>Yep. Casey and Pree are also great guinea pigs:)</p>
<p><b>I identify as a male. But I want to use the Nailbot - is that OK?! </b></p>
<p>Sure! We welcome everyone that celebrates creativity into our company. You are definitely a Preemadonna!</p>
<p><b>Can I beta test the Nailbot first? </b></p>
<p>Our Indiegogo backers, Community Partners and Ambassadors get first access. You can find us at events across the country!</p>
<p><b>STE(A)M &amp; Education</b></p>
<p><b>What is the “Maker Kit”? Can I buy one for my classroom or youth tech camp? </b></p>
<p>So many girls have asked if they could build their own printer. So we created a maker program for girls to program and build their own touchscreen printer. This printer is NOT to be used to print on fingernails - girls can instead print on paper or stickers. The Maker Kit uses Arduino and will come with written and video tutorials.</p>
<p><b>Can I build mobile applications on top of the Nailbot? That would be a great way to have your pre-teen and teen Preemadonnas contribute their computer science skills?</b></p>
<p>In time, YES! That is exactly our intention. Sign up as a Preemadonna Ambassador or if you are part of a social purpose organization, get in touch!</p>
<p><b>Can I or my daughter design art for the Nailbot? </b></p>
<p>YES! That feature will be integrated into our mobile app. In the interim, we are showing girls how to use digital software to create fun nail art. Learn more about our Artist program with our Preemadonna Ambassadors initiative.</p>
<p><b>Nailbot Roadmap</b></p>
<p><b>What happened to the first Nailbot we saw on your website and You Tube Channel? </b></p>
<p>We’ve been working on our Nailbots for a long time! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vyg_WAivbWY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gracie – the early Nailbot – does work!</a> But it is not ready for commercial sale. The touchscreen application is quite novel and we have significant IP filed – but it is not an ideal customer experience just yet. Stay tuned to our company’s progress and you will see it offered for sale in the future.</p>
<p><b>The Nailbot is so cool for my 13 year old daughter, but do you have a Nailbot for me? </b></p>
<p>YES! Though pre-teens and teens are our “power users,” our Nailbots are meant for everyone that expresses themselves with cool art and nail decoration, including our moms, millennial girlfriends and nieces. Even our nephews want the Nailbot!</p>
<p>Future Nailbots: We have been working on our entire product roadmap for three years. We want every girl and woman (or person that loves creativity!) in your family to have a Nailbot that decorates their nails - whether with art designs or full coverage polish! We are a transparent company and hope to involve our earliest supporters in our product development - so here's a sneak peek!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/F0xc90Apjq62w_O3YH9DkBBIPIqFoClQkkde8zWND-WV3MRFNlrIsVWHijvREjfx4ZmBLO225ZihV5rH1hNmW34AEUeHVKKDY_euxAKuChNAucaYFjHdXCz9dAge_5zn7EIVQ5U"" src=""""/></p>
<p><b>Funding</b></p>
<p><b>Do you have outside funding from venture capitalists or famous angel investors? Who is funding this venture? </b></p> <p>Yes, over the past 2 and a half years we have raised a small amount of capital from friends, family, select angels and a hardware accelerator/seed stage venture capital firm. Some of these investors are also advisors and will be crucial as we manufacture. Without these individuals &amp; YOUR support, the Nailbot would not be possible. Thank you!</p>

Our Ambassador program is a way to incorporate our pre-teen and teen supporters into our company and movement. Our Ambassadors are signing up as Hackers, Artists and Social Bees - our program and offerings are serious fun.
Who do you see using the Nailbot the most? 
Girls LOVE the Nailbot. But really anyone that thinks art and tech are cool will get a kick out of the Nailbot.
Have you tested any of your prototypes on people?
Yep. Casey and Pree are also great guinea pigs:)
I identify as a male. But I want to use the Nailbot - is that OK?! 
Sure! We welcome everyone that celebrates creativity into our company. You are definitely a Preemadonna!
Can I beta test the Nailbot first? 
Our Indiegogo backers, Community Partners and Ambassadors get first access. You can find us at events across the country!
STE(A)M & Education
What is the “Maker Kit”? Can I buy one for my classroom or youth tech camp? 
So many girls have asked if they could build their own printer. So we created a maker program for girls to program and build their own touchscreen printer. This printer is NOT to be used to print on fingernails - girls can instead print on paper or stickers. The Maker Kit uses Arduino and will come with written and video tutorials.
Can I build mobile applications on top of the Nailbot? That would be a great way to have your pre-teen and teen Preemadonnas contribute their computer science skills?
In time, YES! That is exactly our intention. Sign up as a Preemadonna Ambassador or if you are part of a social purpose organization, get in touch!
Can I or my daughter design art for the Nailbot? 
YES! That feature will be integrated into our mobile app. In the interim, we are showing girls how to use digital software to create fun nail art. Learn more about our Artist program with our Preemadonna Ambassadors initiative.
Nailbot Roadmap
What happened to the first Nailbot we saw on your website and You Tube Channel? 
We’ve been working on our Nailbots for a long time! Gracie – the early Nailbot – does work! But it is not ready for commercial sale. The touchscreen application is quite novel and we have significant IP filed – but it is not an ideal customer experience just yet. Stay tuned to our company’s progress and you will see it offered for sale in the future.
The Nailbot is so cool for my 13 year old daughter, but do you have a Nailbot for me? 
YES! Though pre-teens and teens are our “power users,” our Nailbots are meant for everyone that expresses themselves with cool art and nail decoration, including our moms, millennial girlfriends and nieces. Even our nephews want the Nailbot!
Future Nailbots: We have been working on our entire product roadmap for three years. We want every girl and woman (or person that loves creativity!) in your family to have a Nailbot that decorates their nails - whether with art designs or full coverage polish! We are a transparent company and hope to involve our earliest supporters in our product development - so here's a sneak peek!

Funding
Do you have outside funding from venture capitalists or famous angel investors? Who is funding this venture?  Yes, over the past 2 and a half years we have raised a small amount of capital from friends, family, select angels and a hardware accelerator/seed stage venture capital firm. Some of these investors are also advisors and will be crucial as we manufacture. Without these individuals & YOUR support, the Nailbot would not be possible. Thank you!

The iconography — from TV sets to roses, light bulbs to shopping plazas, magic charms to fabulous drag —  is culled from my Italian roots and my life experience as a queer, a witch, an artist and an activist.  The Outsider Tarot's symbolism is intuitive and completely open to interpretation.   The Clown Witch of New Orleans, APOSTROPHE as the Root of Bottles ! @apostrophe_period on Instagram! The Outsider Tarot removes all human figures from the Major Arcana to make room for each Outsider to envision themself in every card.  Each one of us is the Fool on our own life journey.   Placing the Fool's bandanna over our eyes, we leap wildly from one Major to the next! I like to think of the 21 Major Arcana cards that come after the Fool as scenes for each Tarot reader to play and improvise.  Each one offers costumes, props, or set pieces to psychically interact with.  The scenes of the MAJOR ARCANA from the Outsider Tarot The Outsider Tarot guidebook offers stage direction with the props, costumes and set pieces for every Major Arcana card.  These stage directions are visual meditations to help each reader dive deep into each Major Arcana and spark psychic visions.   The suits of the Outsider Tarot are represented by symbols that we see everywhere but don’t pay much attention to: LIGHTS, BOTTLES, EYES and ROSES. These objects, at once omnipresent and overlooked, offer profound ways to meditate and to contemplate the power of each suit.  Every Minor Arcana card features an inspiring Outsider or group of Outsiders. Some are instantly recognizable like Edith Piaf from the Fathom of Eyes or Frida Kahlo in the 8 of Bottles.  Other Outsiders are more obscure like R&B singer Jackie Shane from the 5 of Lights. Some minors are representative of many Outsiders like The Resistance pictured in the 3 of Eyes or essential workers in the 7 of Roses.  The SUIT of LIGHTS is where personal identity is forged in the element of fire. It is the suit where we are inspired to begin new projects and go on new adventures. The world of Lights is where our passions burn, consume and transform us. It is the realm of sex and parties, projects and ventures, obsession and intensity, travel and higher learning  — most importantly, it is a place for new beginnings.   The SUIT of BOTTLES is where we nurture ourselves and others in the element of water. Bottles offer a container that gives shape to everything that begins formless, like consciousness, intuition, emotions, knowledge and memories. By giving these matters temporary form in the suit of Bottles, we are able to contemplate their complexity, significance and power. This is the suit of love, nurturing, incubation and meditation. **Includes two versions of the 2 of Bottles.  The SUIT of EYES is where we have an opportunity to connect to our soul, the spirit that animates us, in the element of air.  In the suit of Eyes, we interact with others, with society, in person or virtually. These interactions can be as calm as a breeze or as forceful as a tornado.  The suit of Eyes is where we learn that seeing isn’t always believing. This is where we get out our tools, and we make our ideas into reality. The suit of Eyes is where we fight for our ideas, for justice and for equality.  This is the suit of wisdom and clarity.  The SUIT of ROSES  is where we deepen our connection to the natural world in the element of earth.  When there is little connection to or interest in nature, there will always be more attachment to the material plane. The suit of Roses lets us know when this axis is out of whack, when material concerns and labor dampen our spirits and our ability to enjoy what’s right in front of us.  This is also the suit where we complete and release our creations into the world.   The Outsider Tarot has evicted the King, Queen, Knight and Page and invited a lovely band of eccentrics known as the ELEMENTALS to take their place.  Each Elemental embodies one of the four elements of fire, air, water and earth, bringing all those properties into its suit.   TO SPARK A FIRE:  Sparks embody the element of FIRE — child-like figures at the beginning of a new journey.  Sparks replace Pages.  A BILLOW OF AIR:  Billows characterize the element of Air — young adults in the early stages of life and exploration. Billows replace Knights.** INCLUDES SPECIAL EDITION VERSION OF BILLOW OF BOTTLES: BRITNEY!   TO FATHOM THE WATER:  Fathoms personify the element of Water —  masters who possess the deepest understanding of their suit’s power. Fathoms replace Queens.  TAKE ROOT IN EARTH:  Roots are the element of Earth —  teachers, mentors and sages offering us wisdom and valuable life lessons in each of the four suits.  Roots replace Kings. The 225  page guidebook is the essential guide to the symbolism, meanings and framework of the Outsider Tarot. Reinterpreting every single card, the Outsider Tarot marries ancient esoteric systems with the colorful and revolutionary spirit of Outsiders past and present.  In addition to in-depth information and background on every aspect of the deck, this guidebook also includes a two-page discussion for each card, instructions on how to do readings, a brief history of the Tarot, and a selection of spreads designed specifically for the Outsider Tarot.SILVER FOIL:  The drawing & white pattern on the front cover and the the Wheel diagram on the back cover will be in Silver foil!Image of the actual guidebook  The deck, gudiebook and reading cloth have been printed.

<p><strong>WHO AM I</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Amina Harper and I’m a black, queer, visual artist who has been working professionally for almost 10 years. It’s been quite a journey and I’m currently entering into a new phase of that journey by introducing myself to new mediums, such as acrylic painting and digital design. I began my career in December of 2009, my work was very cartoon-like in style and I was known for drawing pin-ups. I was showing in galleries locally and nationally, and in 2011 I began participating in 2 exhibitions a month. Though I enjoyed the style and methods of the work I was creating, in 2012 I began to feel as though my style was trapping me and preventing me from moving forward, so I started experimenting. During this time my work was imbalanced and detached; I was lost and insecure in my abilities, but I continued trying new things and eventually, in late 2013, I rediscovered gouache and watercolor painting and realized that I could achieve the same vibrant color and crisp detail I loved by melding water based paint with color pencil, a medium I was extremely familiar with. I sort of stumbled upon gouache and watercolor by accident, and even though I became good at it, I eventually found it limiting. Now, that I’m adding acrylic painting to my skill set, I’ve realized that the more artistic tools I have at my disposal the more prolific and long lasting my career will be.</p>

Raygun Gothic Rocketship

A rococo retro-futurist future-rustic vernacular between yesterday’s tomorrow and the future that never was, a critical kitsch somewhere between The Moons of Mongo & Manga Nouveau.

<h3><strong>NEGUS - Abstract</strong></h3>
<p>The ongoing <em>Negus</em> project is a series of films exploring the metaphor of the Negus and retracing the Jamaican tradition of <em>versioning</em> (creating multiple versions of the same song). The project involves some of the godfathers of dub music and Sound System culture.</p>
<p><em>Negus</em> was inspired by a historical event dating from the Italian Fascist period: in the colonial era, after the conquest of Abyssinia, effigies of the last Negus of Ethiopia, Hailé Selassié I, were burnt in the square of our hometown Vernasca, a small village located between Milano and Bologna. This episode coincided with the return of one soldier from the colonial war.</p>
<p>Hailé Selassié I became the Black Messiah for the Rastafarian belief, which was – and still is – much diffused in Jamaica, where the Sound System culture was born in the 1950s.</p>
<p>This way, an event that happened a few kilometres from where we were born and raised enters in resonance with a wider cult developed in the opposite side of the planet, something that cannot pass unnoticed.</p>
<p>A first version of <em>Negus</em>, titled <em>Negus – Duppy Conquerors</em>, was recently realized and presented in Bologna in the occasion of Premio Furla 2013. This version summoned the Duppy Conquerors – hunters of malevolent spirits, recurrent figures in Jamaican musical tradition – to seize the square of Vernasca.</p>

<br/>NEGUS - Abstract</h3>
<p><em>Negus</em> consiste in una serie di film che esplorano la figura dell'ultimo Negus d'Etiopia, Haile Selassie I, e ripercorrono la tradizione giamaicana del <em>versioning</em> (creare versioni differenti della stessa canzone).

<p><em>Negus</em> è ispirato ad un fatto storico che risale al periodo fascista: durante l’occupazione italiana in Etiopia, un soldato ferito fu costretto a rientrare nella sua città natale, a Vernasca, un piccolo paese tra Milano e Bologna. Fu accolto da eroe, e in occasione dei festeggiamenti fu dato fuoco a un fantoccio raffigurante l’imperatore Haile Selassie I, ultimo Negus d’Etiopia, nella piazza del paese. Il racconto di questo avvenimento ha dato origine ad un'espressione del dialetto locale, secondo cui il termine “Negus” designa una persona dal ridicolo aspetto vistoso, trasandato e goffo. Haile Selassie I fu proclamato il messia nero dal culto Rastafari, nato in Giamaica negli anni ‘30.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The current political climate of our country strikes me as oppressively fear-inducing. This work aims to take these fears seriously, and through a process of making and exhibition, exorcise these feelings of anxiety and isolation that are driving many of these fears to consume our thoughts and minds, and become our realities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495903097/mf11jbylzmtc6djagcr4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Above: Hex. Graphite, acrylic, latex and various elements on gallery wall. 11' x 9.5'. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A recent installation of mine, <i>Hex</i>, sought to do this exactly. In this piece, I brought together wall drawing, painting and small sculptures that acted as talismans against my own fear. Imbued with nothing other than my desire for myself and my queer-blended family to be safe, I created the piece to communicate these desires to a viewer. Although I don't believe in magic per se, I <i>do</i> believe in the power of symbolic gestures to articulate the intricacies of another person's lived experiences - which is in itself a form of magic. In other words, I believe in art. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495989583/o4e3t8ypy2y0x8dtpixw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For <i>Counterspell</i> at {Poem88}, I'd like to revisit this earlier piece and expand upon it. I've asked seven other artists - all gay men - to contribute a small work of their own that will be incorporated into my larger, wall-based installation project. These artists are engaged in a variety of disciplines  [ceramics, painting, design, video, etc.] but have all through their work contributed to my own sense of certainty in my studio. I draw a tremendous amount of strength from their work, and I've asked them to lend me their voice in a piece of my own. In this manner, it is my intention to create a piece composed of not one voice but many, to annihilate the feelings of isolation that spring from political and ideological other-ing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495904499/mgcyca7grjdxslq02ujl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Above: limited edition poetry zines I produced.  </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Finally, to accompany this exhibition, I will also publish a small zine bringing together various writing and imagery that has been instrumental to the development of the ideas outlined here. The zine will be made available during the exhibition for a small fee. The zines will be staple-bound, black and white photocopy with spot color and screenprinted covers. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This aspect of the project feels particularly meaningful, in that self-publishing has a long history with tackling and addressing marginalized and unusual subject matter as well as serving as a form of community-building between like-minded individuals. Additionally, the DIY ethos of zine production rings true within the larger structure of institutionalized power that is, in many ways, being critiqued by the exhibition itself. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">A project of this scale is not without expenses, and this is where I'm asking for your aid. </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need // What You Get</h3>
<p>A piece this large requires a certain amount of density, which is why I've budgeted for more  materials than I typically work with in my projects. A portion of donated funds will go towards clay, paint, sculpture supplies and the other raw components of the work itself. Additionally, installation materials (plastic sheeting, spackle, latex paint and so on) are included in the total cost. Because my studio is based in Athens and {Poem88} is based in Atlanta, I've also factored in costs for commuting back and forth between the two.</p>
<p>Additionally, a portion of your donations will be used  to aid in the creation, shipping, and insuring of the other artists' works who are contributing to the project. Last but not least, your contributions will fund the production and publication of the limited edition zine accompanying the exhibition itself. </p>
<p>As a bighearted thank you for your support this campaign offers a range of perks in return for your contributions. Postcards, copies of the zines, and original artwork all await your generous hands should you feel so inclined to contribute. You are all so awesome for helping me realize this -- I want you to feel appreciated!</p>

</div></div>","Here's the digs:

My name is Brian Hitselberger - I'm an artist and a professor living and working in Athens, Georgia.  Later this summer, I'm mounting an exhibition of new work, titled Counterspell, at {Poem88} gallery in Atlanta, Georgia. The show will be comprised of recent paintings and a new, site-specific installation comprised of many small elements, as well as the work of seven other artists, who I've asked to contribute to this piece. With your help, I'd like to make this project a reality. 

 
The current political climate of our country strikes me as oppressively fear-inducing. This work aims to take these fears seriously, and through a process of making and exhibition, exorcise these feelings of anxiety and isolation that are driving many of these fears to consume our thoughts and minds, and become our realities. 
 

Above: Hex. Graphite, acrylic, latex and various elements on gallery wall. 11' x 9.5'. 
 
A recent installation of mine, Hex, sought to do this exactly. In this piece, I brought together wall drawing, painting and small sculptures that acted as talismans against my own fear. Imbued with nothing other than my desire for myself and my queer-blended family to be safe, I created the piece to communicate these desires to a viewer. Although I don't believe in magic per se, I do believe in the power of symbolic gestures to articulate the intricacies of another person's lived experiences - which is in itself a form of magic. In other words, I believe in art. 
 

 
For Counterspell at {Poem88}, I'd like to revisit this earlier piece and expand upon it. I've asked seven other artists - all gay men - to contribute a small work of their own that will be incorporated into my larger, wall-based installation project. These artists are engaged in a variety of disciplines  [ceramics, painting, design, video, etc.] but have all through their work contributed to my own sense of certainty in my studio. I draw a tremendous amount of strength from their work, and I've asked them to lend me their voice in a piece of my own. In this manner, it is my intention to create a piece composed of not one voice but many, to annihilate the feelings of isolation that spring from political and ideological other-ing. 
 

Above: limited edition poetry zines I produced.  
 
Finally, to accompany this exhibition, I will also publish a small zine bringing together various writing and imagery that has been instrumental to the development of the ideas outlined here. The zine will be made available during the exhibition for a small fee. The zines will be staple-bound, black and white photocopy with spot color and screenprinted covers. 
This aspect of the project feels particularly meaningful, in that self-publishing has a long history with tackling and addressing marginalized and unusual subject matter as well as serving as a form of community-building between like-minded individuals. Additionally, the DIY ethos of zine production rings true within the larger structure of institutionalized power that is, in many ways, being critiqued by the exhibition itself. 
A project of this scale is not without expenses, and this is where I'm asking for your aid. 

What We Need // What You Get
A piece this large requires a certain amount of density, which is why I've budgeted for more  materials than I typically work with in my projects. A portion of donated funds will go towards clay, paint, sculpture supplies and the other raw components of the work itself. Additionally, installation materials (plastic sheeting, spackle, latex paint and so on) are included in the total cost. Because my studio is based in Athens and {Poem88} is based in Atlanta, I've also factored in costs for commuting back and forth between the two.
Additionally, a portion of your donations will be used  to aid in the creation, shipping, and insuring of the other artists' works who are contributing to the project. Last but not least, your contributions will fund the production and publication of the limited edition zine accompanying the exhibition itself. 
As a bighearted thank you for your support this campaign offers a range of perks in return for your contributions. Postcards, copies of the zines, and original artwork all await your generous hands should you feel so inclined to contribute. You are all so awesome for helping me realize this -- I want you to feel appreciated!
One last thing: I've set up this campaign for a certain dollar amount, but in the amount that my goal is not reached, the show will go on - I'll just have to scale back here and there (a smaller run of the zine, or a smaller version of the wall piece, etc.), so don't you worry!

Impact

In all seriousness, I feel that the arts are among the few freedoms that we truly have, and that they represent possibilities for dialogue and mutual understanding that transcend the limits of language. With your contribution, I can put this philosophy into practice in the public sphere through the work itself. Art can operate many ways within in our world, but I've always felt that among its most noble purposes was the attempt to allow a viewer to feel less lonely. Counterspell seeks to do exactly this. 

This combination of studio work and site-specific installation is right in line with my practice of the last several years. Previously, I've mounted solo exhibitions at the University of the South, the University of North Georgia-Dahlonega, and Greenville Technical College, and in each these occasions I executed a piece directly within the gallery itself. Additionally, I've created installation work for group exhibitions in galleries and museums consistently for over 10 years now. A few exhibitions I was particularly proud to have my work included in from the last several years:
