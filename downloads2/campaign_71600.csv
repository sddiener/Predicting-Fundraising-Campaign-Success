<h1>What We Are About</h1>
<p>A good beer and a good story go together like barley and water, and we want to provide quality beer so you can share your story with the world.  When you take that first sip of refreshing beer, wipe the foam away from your upper lip, and swallow that delicious beverage--at that moment, an imaginary light turns green, and your lips start moving before your mind can shut the flood gate.  You are free to tell your story.  </p>
<p>Novel Brewing Company is owned by a husband and wife team who live in the Golden Gate District of Oakland, CA and are excited for the opportunity to open a brewery and tasting room in their neighborhood.  Their passion for the craft is reflected in their product, and they can’t wait to share it with you.  When their doors open, and the first pint sized page turner is poured, will you be there to help write the first chapter?  </p>
<h1>The Beer</h1>
<p>You can expect a wide variety of beers to be made by Novel Brewing Company. We are a small brewery that will have the flexibility to experiment and keep things fresh. Some styles to look forward to are the Gose, IPA, English-style Porter, Pils, Dry Stout, English-style Bitter, American Brown Ale, Wheatwine, Black Rye IPA, American Pale Ale, Belgian-style Pale Ale, Belgian-style Dubbel, and Belgian-style Tripel.  </p>
<h1>The Perks</h1><div>
<h4>Local Pickup and Shipping Options</h4>
<p>We plan on hosting a Perk pickup party for those who are local and would like to hangout, have a few beers, and pickup their perks.  Otherwise, we will reach out to you via email to arrange for shipping.  Note: We will only ship within the United States.</p>

<h1>Why We Need Money</h1>
<p>You may be asking why you should donate your hard earned dough to another crowdfunding campaign?  As it turns out, opening a brewery and tasting room is really freaking expensive!  We need your help.  We've drawn the sap from as many of our currency producing oaks as possible, and we are now only months away from brewing our first batch of beer.  The $25,000 raised through this campaign will allow Novel Brewing Company to finish what we have started.  Your donation will go a long way towards putting our glycol chiller on the roof, pouring a new slab of concrete in the cellar and brewery, and to create a welcoming space to exchange your wild yarns and novel ideas. </p>

<h1>Mission</h1>
<p>Novel Brewing Company is a narrative told through the art and science of brewing beer for our local community. Within the pages of Novel Brewing Company are chapters that will be written by our tasting room patrons. These chapters will provide nourishment for new stories and the development of new characters. The scenes will extend beyond the boundaries of the brewery and spill into the surrounding neighborhoods, quenching the thirsts of long time friends, sidekicks, and newly discovered cohorts. It is the mission of Novel Brewing Company to help sustain a sense of connectedness through beer and community.</p>

<hr/>
<p>My name is Timotheus Greene and I live in Pickering, Ontario with my wife Elisha Greene.  At an early age I had a  love for sci-fi and pop culture when I was first introduced to Star Trek and Star Wars.  As I got older I continued to follow many of the TV shows, movies and documentaries related to those franchises. In addition I also ran a successful fan-based Star Trek website for five years with over 200 fans. This allowed me to connect with a community of passionate fans to learn about their likes and dislikes. I have received a diploma in Small Business Management and worked in retail for over 11 years which encompassed inventory, fulfillment, merchandising and customer service. After attending major pop culture events such as FanExpo Toronto where you are able to meet actors &amp; artists and buy their latest items, I realized that after those events it is very hard to find quality items and to experience the sense of community with those that share the same passion. </p>
<p>This is where Stuff of Legends comes in, I came up with the concept for Stuff of Legends which will be a pop culture retail store consisting of unique and hard to find items, combined with a café, lounge area, party room and gaming area. I want to provide a place where people can meet up with other fans and enjoy a welcoming atmosphere.  There is no store comparable to it in the Durham Region and this is why I plan to open the Stuff of Legends in the core of Pickering. My hope is to start connecting and building the community in the Durham Region.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2><b>The Goal &amp; Ways to Support:</b></h2>
<hr/>
<p>Stuff of Legends will be located in Pickering, Ontario near Whites Rd and Kingston Rd and it will be opened 7 days a week.  The amount necessary to start my venture is $80,000.  I have submitted a business plan for a business grant of $50,000 and if accepted would help me start the business.  The purpose of this campaign is to raise $20,000 in hopes to add it to the business grant if accepted and if rejected to apply for a business loan of $80,000.  I feel that this venture would put my knowledge and passion to good use and leave an impact on the pop culture community.  All I need is 200 people to contribute $100 each and I will reach my goal and begin to see this dream come to life! </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WeNote is the smartest way to remember everything, stay organized, and easily keep in touch with your friends, family, and colleagues.</span><br/></p>
<p>WeNote is the first indoor reminder system that keeps you on track - reminding you of everything at the right time, and in the right place. </p>
<p>The innovative system, made-up of an app and a proximity sensor (also known as ""beacon""), sends you reminders when you enter or exit a specific place and lets you quickly and easily share notes with others - just like a real pinboard! </p>

Just place the  WeNote proximity sensor,  AKA “beacon”, in a convenient place in your home, office or anywhere else you might need it. It will even work in the car! Then start setting reminders or posting notes to yourself or the people you share the same space with, and receive the notification only when you are around; so always at the right time, and in the right place.</p></div>

<p>The development of the app is already in the Alpha version for iOS devices. All funds raised will be used to improve the development of the app on both iOS and Android, to add more and more useful functionality and to increase the number of users per site.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal we will be able to provide applications on both platforms, establish ourselves in the market, and integrate our application with other systems, such as IFTTT or with home automation systems. But we need your help and your feedback to improve.</p>

</div></div>","What is WeNote?


WeNote is the smartest way to remember everything, stay organized, and easily keep in touch with your friends, family, and colleagues.
WeNote is the first indoor reminder system that keeps you on track - reminding you of everything at the right time, and in the right place. 
The innovative system, made-up of an app and a proximity sensor (also known as ""beacon""), sends you reminders when you enter or exit a specific place and lets you quickly and easily share notes with others - just like a real pinboard! 



How many times have you left the house for the day and forgotten to take out the garbage, lock the door, or grab your wallet, and only realized it when you were stuck in rush hour traffic with no way to turn back? 
How many times have you forgotten about a meeting, or to make an important phone call or send an email that you could change the course of the day (or your career)? 
WeNote can help you in all of these situations and resolve your everyday problems and anxieties. 





Featured on:



















Why need WeNote?






Tired of your roommates not taking out the garbage, or dishes just piling up in the sink for weeks on end? Put a WeNote beacon somewhere convenient for everyone and sit back and let the reminder system gently notify you and your roommate of the shared household tasks without you becoming the bad guy. 


Need to send a ""message of the day"" to all your team to keep them up-to-date? Want to remind the last colleague exiting the office to switch off the coffee machine? Place the WeNote beacon in the office and let it help you coordinate your working group and get all things done.



When you have to take one important thing before you leave the house, put the WeNote beacon in a strategic place, maybe at the front door, and you will receive a reminder when you pass by.






What makes WeNote so special








How does it work

WeNote’s primary purpose is to make your life simpler, so it’s easy to use! Just place the  WeNote proximity sensor,  AKA “beacon”, in a convenient place in your home, office or anywhere else you might need it. It will even work in the car! Then start setting reminders or posting notes to yourself or the people you share the same space with, and receive the notification only when you are around; so always at the right time, and in the right place.












WeNote - The most useful application you’ve ever had



Last year at the MobApp Award SMAU, WeNote won the innovation award. Why? It’s very useful to be able to send and receive notifications only when and where it is necessary. Invite the people you share space with every day and stay connected in an smart way. Let WeNote take care of all of the daily duties and reminders that you need so you can focus on what matters most. Kiss anxiety goodbye!








Technical details 



The WeNote beacon is a very small device, lightweight and easy to install. It communicates with your smartphone via Bluetooth low energy technology when it is in the immediate vicinity. WeNote will be sent with a double-sided adhesive, so you can stick it wherever you want.












Let’s improve our everyday life together!


We’re the first to recognize that we need all of the features that WeNote offers and we firmly believe that it will be of great help to those like us who have a lot of things to remember every day. We really want to make WeNote a reality.
The development of the app is already in the Alpha version for iOS devices. All funds raised will be used to improve the development of the app on both iOS and Android, to add more and more useful functionality and to increase the number of users per site.
If we reach our goal we will be able to provide applications on both platforms, establish ourselves in the market, and integrate our application with other systems, such as IFTTT or with home automation systems. But we need your help and your feedback to improve.




Rewards







Tomorrow is today



WeNote can be integrated in many security and home automation systems. Wouldn’t it be great to have your house alarm activated or your sprinkler system turned off automatically just by leaving or entering the house? If your company develops such systems, contact us to see how we can work together.

<p><b>But, we need your help to make our taproom the best in the universe!</b></p>
<div>Like most brewery projects we planned for the worst, and still came a bit under budget. Usually the first place where you can cut money out is a taproom. This is because its more important to be able to actually make the beer, than to have a place to enjoy the beer! The beer that can't be made because you spent so much on the place to enjoy it!</div>
<br/><p><b>Our brewing equipment and construction alone, will reach a cost of around $700,000!</b></p>

<p><b>Here's what we are asking of our community:</b></p>
<p>By helping us to make our taproom more affordable, you are guaranteeing a comfortable, exciting place to enjoy our great beers and events. We are talking, comic art, arcade machines, projectors and video screens, a small stage for live music and events, areas for table top gaming and private parties, the works! At the same time, you will be getting some pretty cool Heroic Aleworks gear and recognition.  <b> </b></p>

<p>The Beer for Life perk is pretty darn cool, but our other perks are cool too!</p>
<p>Heroic Aleworks branded glassware, T-Shirts, stickers and the like!</p>
<p>A chance to actually become a super hero inspired beer with your likeness illustrated for the character!</p>

<p><b>REFERRAL CONTEST:</b></p>
<p>We want to have as much exposure as possible for our brewery and our campaign. Therefore, we are going to run a referral contest throughout the entire period of the campaign. Those who refer the campaign to others using their IndieGoGo account will be tracked and anyone who refers over $1000 worth of contributions will be in the running for a FREE, Beer for Life card! All you have to do is refer $1000 worth of contributions AND have the most referrals over all and the Beer for Life card is yours!</p>

<p><b>Thanks for helping us become super!</b></p>
<b><br/>RISKS AND CHALLENGES:<br/></b>Starting a craft brewery is a fairly complicated endeavor. As anyone who has ever started a business knows, it requires quite a bit of capital up front, as well as a lot of paperwork, a flurry of legal issues and potential pitfalls. Add alcohol production and the government into the mix and you have recipe for a very bitter experience.

</div></div>","Want to get in on the coolest thing since the advent of the craft beer movement?We’re unlike anything you’ve ever seen. Every beer is a work of art. We’re dedicated to adventurous ingredients in palatable perfection.We’re not just a brewery. Every beer we create represents a fully realized superhero character that revolves around our very own comic book universe, illustrated in stunning detail by comic artists.We’re ready to roll out our flagship beers...Solasta Kölsch                                        Dr. Enigma IPA                                   Max Nix English Porter                           Death Blossom Red Rye                                        
                                           Mind Trappe Belgian Dubbel

                                                     

But, we need your help to make our taproom the best in the universe!
Like most brewery projects we planned for the worst, and still came a bit under budget. Usually the first place where you can cut money out is a taproom. This is because its more important to be able to actually make the beer, than to have a place to enjoy the beer! The beer that can't be made because you spent so much on the place to enjoy it!
Our brewing equipment and construction alone, will reach a cost of around $700,000!
But don't worry, we have that covered!

Here's what we are asking of our community:
By helping us to make our taproom more affordable, you are guaranteeing a comfortable, exciting place to enjoy our great beers and events. We are talking, comic art, arcade machines, projectors and video screens, a small stage for live music and events, areas for table top gaming and private parties, the works! At the same time, you will be getting some pretty cool Heroic Aleworks gear and recognition.   
I mean who wouldn't want BEER FOR LIFE?!  FOR LIFE, PEOPLE!
We humbly ask you to help us achieve this goal, so that we may bring you an exceptional quality product, in an exceptionally fun and exciting atmosphere to enjoy it!
The Beer for Life perk is pretty darn cool, but our other perks are cool too!
Heroic Aleworks branded glassware, T-Shirts, stickers and the like!
A chance to actually become a super hero inspired beer with your likeness illustrated for the character!
VIP events and tastings!
And last but not least, secret perk that will be announced mid-campaign that you WILL NOT want to miss!
REFERRAL CONTEST:
We want to have as much exposure as possible for our brewery and our campaign. Therefore, we are going to run a referral contest throughout the entire period of the campaign. Those who refer the campaign to others using their IndieGoGo account will be tracked and anyone who refers over $1000 worth of contributions will be in the running for a FREE, Beer for Life card! All you have to do is refer $1000 worth of contributions AND have the most referrals over all and the Beer for Life card is yours!

Thanks for helping us become super!
RISKS AND CHALLENGES:Starting a craft brewery is a fairly complicated endeavor. As anyone who has ever started a business knows, it requires quite a bit of capital up front, as well as a lot of paperwork, a flurry of legal issues and potential pitfalls. Add alcohol production and the government into the mix and you have recipe for a very bitter experience. And not in a good, IPA kind of way...That fact is though, we have already crossed a lot of those hurdles. Heroic Aleworks will open this fall. The question here is whether or not we will be able to have a comfortable, exciting and engaging taproom for our customers to enjoy; as we have had to cut a lot of expenses just to get the brewery operational.
We want to build a community around our project and around our brewery. We believe that a community funded event will help us do just that. This is your brewery, and your community, lets share it together!

There will be travel expenses with visiting potential businesses and visiting current partners to make sure we are creating mutual value between consumers and businesses (budget $4-6k).

<p>Michigan has much to offer to not only its residents, but to anyone who visits.<br/></p>
<p>This is going to be <b>awesome</b> for our state and for our communities.  Many local economies have been recovering beautifully over the last several years and we want to see this trend continue.  We have developed a way to support this trend by creating a directory to connect consumers with really cool unique businesses in the niches of entertainment, eating, drinking and shopping. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
</div><div> <p>We need your contributions in order to <b>expand the Celebrate Our State membership to a vast number of businesses in many towns in Michigan</b>.  We are risking a significant amount of time, money and energy to accomplish our goal of a state wide initiative that includes unique businesses in <b>your</b> favorite town(s). There are three main risks in this business model. The first is that we are not able to provide a minimally viable product due to businesses not participating. If that were to happen then we face the risk of people not buying the membership due to lack of value. Competition is the other risk, which is true with most businesses, so the speed at which we can accomplish our mission is crucial. Most of the challenges lie within technology and manpower. We need to have a great website, one that is user friendly and easy on the eyes. We also need a team in place to operate the business in all facets just mentioned.   </p> <ul> <li><i>Challenge 1: we provide the directory listing for free to our partner businesses. There is typically not a good reason for one not to participate. So far, we are at over a 90% success rate on new businesses joining us when invited and are getting some organically joining us through our website enroll page.</i></li>
<li><i>Challenge 2: we have had sales and free trials so we know that there is interest and value already, and we will increase that value. </i></li>
<li><i>Challenge 3: we are ahead of anyone trying to compete, but we need to act fast with any funds we have to stay ahead of competition, as there will most likely be some, especially when our model proves itself as well as we believe it will.</i></li> <li><i>Plan for solving these challenges: we are working with people that are gifted in the area of technology and plans are in place for an upgraded website. If we have the funds to bring on another team member to invite and add more businesses to our directory, then it frees more of our time to make sure every facet of the business is running smoothly and efficiently and expedites our goal of reaching hundreds, possibly thousands of businesses, providing an unheard of value to our members.</i></li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Being electronics enthusiasts, we've been using micro-controllers for most of our adult life and we've always felt the need for more: more speed, more capabilities, easier programming &amp; debugging to name a few. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Apart from micro-controllers, we've also used Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and though these are really neat by themselves, they are not very easy for everyone to use. You need to learn difficult programming languages called HDLs. Also, FPGAs don't contain micro-controllers, are purely digital in nature and hence you cannot directly interface analog signals.</p>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1242376/files/20150223083630-zeeSoC_Sub_icon.png?1424709390"" src="""" style=""width: 407.687px; height: 361px;""/>
<br/>
<p>The zeeSoC is a cross between a micro-controller, FPGA and precision analog chips. It contains a 80MHz ARM Cortex-M3 core with precision analog and digital fabric. This enables you to design your hardware with software. The development environment is not only intuitive, but allows you to graphically program your chip, which enables you to design more and iterate less. Simply drag and drop any of the existing 100+ peripherals (or create your own), graphically configure it, assign the pins to any of the hardware pins and you are well on your way to make some magic.</p>
<p>The zeeSoC features on-chip debugging which lets you view the state of the system while it executes your code. No need for serial print commands, you can rapidly analyze the system and fix bugs in no time. All this enables you to emulate hardware: that's right, you can emulate commercial chips within the zeeSoC and you end up with a truly custom System-on-a-Chip solution which does exactly what you want it to do.</p>

<h2>
<b>The zeeSoC is in a league of its own, here’s why:</b>
</h2>
<p><b><span>1.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Faster, Powerful
Hardware:</b></p>
<p><span><span></span></span>The zeeSoC consists of a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3
CPU clocked at 80MHz which can deliver 100 DMIPS. It also features a
programmable nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC) with 256KB of FLASH,
64KB SRAM, 2KB EEPROM and contains 24 DMA channels to free the processor which in
turn enables data transfer at unparalleled speeds.</p>
<p><b><span>2.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Debug Like
A Pro With on-chip Debugging:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1242437/files/20150223090131-debug_LR.jpg?1424710891"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The zeeSoC can pause program execution and let
you view the state of the system, enabling you to check exact values of memory
registers, variables, peripheral buffers etc, thus giving you all the
information you need to analyze and debug your system without having to resort
to tradition Serial.println() statements which do not give you an exact overview
of the state of the system, are very time consuming and inefficient to say the
least.
<b><span><br/><br/>3.<span>  </span></span></b><b>Design More, Iterate Less With Graphical Programming:<br/></b><p>The zeeSoC makes use of the Cypress
Semiconductor’s PSoC creator which lets you graphically configure any of the
over 100 existing peripherals ranging from digital logic gates, analog/digital
components, communication interfaces etc.</p>
<p><b></b></p>

<p><span><span></span></span>This enables you to scale quickly, make design
changes rapidly, without having to read endless datasheets.</p>
<p><span><span></span></span>The zeeSoC is perfect even if you are just
starting out. Don’t believe us? Check out the demos/tutorials on <a href=""http://www.zeeSoC.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.zeeSoC.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zeeSoC.com</a> to learn more.<br/></p>

micro-controllers. Why should the serial port be limited to only pin 2/3 when

</div></div>","The story so far...
Being electronics enthusiasts, we've been using micro-controllers for most of our adult life and we've always felt the need for more: more speed, more capabilities, easier programming & debugging to name a few. 
Apart from micro-controllers, we've also used Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and though these are really neat by themselves, they are not very easy for everyone to use. You need to learn difficult programming languages called HDLs. Also, FPGAs don't contain micro-controllers, are purely digital in nature and hence you cannot directly interface analog signals.

ENTER zeeSoC  


The zeeSoC is a cross between a micro-controller, FPGA and precision analog chips. It contains a 80MHz ARM Cortex-M3 core with precision analog and digital fabric. This enables you to design your hardware with software. The development environment is not only intuitive, but allows you to graphically program your chip, which enables you to design more and iterate less. Simply drag and drop any of the existing 100+ peripherals (or create your own), graphically configure it, assign the pins to any of the hardware pins and you are well on your way to make some magic.
The zeeSoC features on-chip debugging which lets you view the state of the system while it executes your code. No need for serial print commands, you can rapidly analyze the system and fix bugs in no time. All this enables you to emulate hardware: that's right, you can emulate commercial chips within the zeeSoC and you end up with a truly custom System-on-a-Chip solution which does exactly what you want it to do.
Help us build the zeeSoC community. Read further for more information and back us today. 


With the zeeSoC you can!
Quick Specs:


Device Chip:            
CY8C5888AXI-LP096

Watch the following video to blink LEDs in less than 4 minutes from first plugging-in the zeeSoC


More resources at www.zeeSoC.com/resources.html



The zeeSoC is in a league of its own, here’s why:

1. 
Faster, Powerful
Hardware:
The zeeSoC consists of a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3
CPU clocked at 80MHz which can deliver 100 DMIPS. It also features a
programmable nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC) with 256KB of FLASH,
64KB SRAM, 2KB EEPROM and contains 24 DMA channels to free the processor which in
turn enables data transfer at unparalleled speeds.
2. 
Debug Like
A Pro With on-chip Debugging:

The zeeSoC can pause program execution and let
you view the state of the system, enabling you to check exact values of memory
registers, variables, peripheral buffers etc, thus giving you all the
information you need to analyze and debug your system without having to resort
to tradition Serial.println() statements which do not give you an exact overview
of the state of the system, are very time consuming and inefficient to say the
least.
3.  Design More, Iterate Less With Graphical Programming:The zeeSoC makes use of the Cypress
Semiconductor’s PSoC creator which lets you graphically configure any of the
over 100 existing peripherals ranging from digital logic gates, analog/digital
components, communication interfaces etc.


This enables you to scale quickly, make design
changes rapidly, without having to read endless datasheets.
The zeeSoC is perfect even if you are just
starting out. Don’t believe us? Check out the demos/tutorials on www.zeeSoC.com to learn more.
4. 
Any Pin,
Any Function:

Free yourself from fixed function
micro-controllers. Why should the serial port be limited to only pin 2/3 when
you can have a much better design if it were on pin 17/18 or 23/29? With the zeeSoC you can!
Each of the peripherals can be connected to any
pin on the device, GRAPHICALLY. Making it even simpler. Just select the pin you
want to map it do, re-build your project and Voila!
5. 
Emulate Hardware
And Make Your Own System-on-a-Chip (SoC):


This is where the zeeSoC really takes it home!
Using graphical programming, flexible pin mapping capabilities and existing
peripherals you can easily emulate existing chips and create your own
System-on-a-Chip, which does exactly what you want it to do and nothing more.
This not only reduces your BOM and saves valuable PCB area, it lets you have a
custom solution for whatever you intend to design.6.  Add  Touch With
in-built Capsense: 


Why add mechanical switches to your product when
you can easily have a touch interface? The zeeSoC has inbuilt capsense which
lets you add sliders, buttons, proximity switches to your product without
additional hardware or intricacies.
7. 
Hobby Meets
Professionalism:


zeeSoC is arduino shield compatible. Just stack
your existing shield on-top, graphically create your project and watch it
work:
hassle-free! No need to buy propriety shields, re-use your existing electronics
and take them further with the zeeSoC.
Just like arduino, the zeeSoC supports open
source hardware. Design files and revisions are maintained at www.github.com/frenoy-osburn/zeeSoC

In my life, I have, and still do struggle with balance issues when it comes to  substances, foods and drinks. Like many others out there, I know it takes support, strength, flexibility, and endurance to keep balanced in what we put in our bodies.

  ionicWell™ LLC Wellness Center (iWC)







From my experiences natural healing orientated businesses online and brick and mortar are much needed in our communities today. In my life, I have, and still do struggle with balance issues when it comes to  substances, foods and drinks. Like many others out there, I know it takes support, strength, flexibility, and endurance to keep balanced in what we put in our bodies. This is why I decided to dedicate my life journey to learn about natural wellness and share what I learn.

Our New And Improved Herbally Pure High
Potency 
Liquid Vitamins Are Loaded With Minerals and Antioxidants as seen on TV on
""The View"" with Whoopi Goldberg.  Also seen on Small Brand Nation!


                                                      

Herbally Pure is a Vegan friendly product with No Fructose and Now Electrolyte Enhanced!

USA SHIPPING ONLY FOR NOW SORRY!!



Herbally Pure is Happy to announce we have aligned with ""Be Someone's Hero"" anti bullying non-profit. 5% of all our proceeds after the indiegogo round will go to supporting this great cause!! Please visit them today! www.besomeoneshero.net





Here is what we need help with and in exchange you will get some great discounts and perks!
Herbally Pure is raising money to ramp up our first NEW batch of our 5 different sized bottles. We would also like to revamp our website to include other marketing avenues and product development.
We are relaunching the Herbally Pure product line after being off the market for a few years and now under new ownership and direction.  We have past customers that are very glad we are coming back to market and have great marketing, sales and networking outlets set up once we are in full production.

We will also have an amazing fundraising / affiliate marketing platform.

Once we have successfully raised the needed money we seek with your help we will have product available within 4-6 weeks.

We are looking to raise $45,000 which will help us get our products back into full production at our laboratory we have worked with in the past in Naples Florida! We are a USA developed and produced company.


We will be offering some amazing discounts and perks during this round of funding included but not limited to at cost pricing, wholesale pricing, affiliate incentives and a Trip for 2 to Miami for 3 days and 2 nights including dinner with the founders! There will be additional items attached to each product perk as we move forward.








If we do not achieve our entire funding goal we will do another round of funding to get our amazing products off the ground.  BUT with that said all orders will be fullfilled. BUT also know we might only run a few of the SKUs which means you could be getting a different size bottle or products. Some of the money raised will be used for more marketing and website updates. But we are positive with your help and the correct education be given to individuals, families and organizations, we will hit our goal and then some!





Herbally Pure has 5 Amazing product sizes that will help you and your families health:1) 32oz bottle   



2) 16oz bottle

3) 8oz MultiVitamin RTD (ready to drink) bottles 


4) 12 pack case of 2oz shot bottles (a name change will be made to: Super Vitamin Shot!)

5)  Vitamin Water Kit consists of a 16oz concentrate Herbally Pure bottle and a 20oz BPA friendly reusable water bottle.

Herbally Pure also has two 1 minute TV commercials in English and Spanish for future use as well as a 30 second video. We have also partnered with Sports Shop Network to help and promote Herbally Pure on their eCommerce website and TV shopping channel that is launching soon.



THE PLAN:



We believe we are bringing the Healthiest, True to Label Liquid Vitamin Product to Market! Too many Liquid vitamins on the market over inflate their ingredients and OFTEN over load them into their products.  Not
only can this be harmful by taxing your kidneys and it also sends a bad message
to consumers that more is better. In this case that is not true.









We will officially launch an Fundraising and Affiliate program to help those schools, sports teams, colleges, non profits and others to raise money for their causes.  We will continue to let those programs continue to raise money after their set date.  This will give continued support at discount prices and ongoing health & wellness for their community, friends and family.


CHALLENGES:


Our biggest challenge in the beginning will be re-educating the general public on why ""Herbally Pure"" Liquid Vitamins are the healthier choice than other vitamins on the market.  We need to be able to show them educated research that 99.9% of the Liquid vitamins on the market are actually bad for your health.  First of all the other Liquid Vitamins on the market that claim to be All Natural are not. Consumers can look at the expiration on their current vitamins and if the expiration date is over 1 year it has an artificial preservative. 
Our Herbally Pure brand is true to label and our All Natural preservative is only good for 1 year.  Also we have articles that can educate WHY Liquid Vitamins Vs. Pill choices are much healthier for you and environment.


Our second biggest challenge will be fulfilling large purchase orders from companies such as Wal-mart, Whole foods and others that have taken interest.

How to back us!

Also, that just because their products has 200 - 3000% percent of the RDA it is NOT healthier. The most we have in most of our vitamins is at the 125% ratio which is recommended by the FDA.

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Crowdfunding is based on the developers’ accountability towards the backers. Us towards you. Trust is therefore our most valuable asset, and we take that very, very seriously. Here are the six most important components of this Indiegogo campaign for matters relevant to you, the customer:</span><br/>
</div>
<p><b><i>1. Shipping Service: </i></b><br/><br/>Shipping charges are unfortunately unnavoidable, but we are absorbing a portion of these fees anticipating potential volume discounts.  listed in the Perks Section of the campaign, one must be included with every bike order. They will be arranged through USPS or UPS depending on your location. When your order is to be dispatched, you will be provided with a tracking number. As per our standards, all of our shipments are insured for their full value.  If there is an issue upon receipt or if, for some reason, the bike is damaged during shipping, we will work out a solution with you in a quick and efficient manner.</p>
<p>We have done it in the past with other products so we know what we're doing! Our logistics are in place and very tight...We have your back. </p>
<p><b><i>2. Shipping Delays:</i></b></p>
<p>After manufacture, your CHUB will be shipped by ground service to all orders located in continental USA or via air delivery for all oversees orders.  Therefore, depending on where you are located shipping should take between 3-15 days once it is out of our hands.  Please note that the shipment can also be delayed while going through customs for our global clients. Our team will be available to monitor your orders and answer your question during transit.</p>
<p><b><i>3. Shipping Charges: </i></b></p>
<p><b>All continental USA orders NOW HAVE FREE SHIPPING (Valued at $119) Worldwide orders require: $295.  </b></p>
<p><b>Nice and easy and cheaper than the competition!  Even factoring the unavoidable shipping fees we are <i>STILL Hundreds Less Than the Competition!</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>4. Warranty:</i></b> </p>
<p>Unlike many other Indiegogo projects, we are already an incorporated company, this means we are fully accountable to our customers for any manufacturing defects and we hold customer service in the highest regard!  Each of our Chub fat tire bikes carry a lifetime warranty on the frame...Thats right LIFETIME!   Every other component carries a one year warranty. We will work with you as best we can in any situation that may arise, these are VERY durable performance machines, over engineered by design...Satisfaction guaranteed.</p>
<p><b><i>5. Assembly:</i></b></p>
<p>The bikes will be shipped 85% assembled. The wheels, handlebar, seat post as well as other minor components must be assembled upon receipt. Certain other minor adjustments might be required after assembly, such as the derailleur and the brakes. If you are not familiar with bicycle mechanics, we suggest you have it assembled by a professional in a local bike shop, or just give us a call we would be happy to talk you through basic adjustments!</p>
<p><b><i>6. General Feasibility:</i></b></p>
<p>Having previously launched multiple successful startups, we have had our share of trials and tribulations: that is the reality of all entrepreneurs. As a result, we had to work hard to execute solutions and successful action plans so we have a firm understanding of the road ahead.  It doesn’t mean that we expect a cake walk but we are ready and willing to face this challenge and follow-through with what we promise.</p>

</div></div>","Thank you for visiting this Chub Fat Bike campaign, we have since relisted this for another 35 day extention, the link is attached below!https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/chub-fat-tire-bikes/x/10601290#/
Please inquire with any questions !!!
A good fat bike is beautifully designed, exceptionally stout, light, ergonomic and safe...Then what does a great fat bike look like you ask?  
Well that’s simple, all of the above features and a straight forward price not inflated by multitudes of middle men....A price that you want and will gladly pay including FREE SHIPPING to all continental USA locations!  
You simply don't need to compromise on the quality of your ride; instead compromise on all those added charges keeping you from the fat bike you deserve.


Our direct sales model is the poster child of modern commerce!  We have done our research and we have heard what the average enthusiast wants and needs and we've finally arrived to deliver exactly that...Through our global partnerships with streamlined manufacturing and through economies of scale we are able to provide a refreshing new value in cycling.
CHUB Fat Bikes has partnered with one of the top frame fabricators on the planet, they produce bikes for many of the top global brands and their quality is outstanding and consistent.  We have cooperated with them on this bike concept to shake up the fat tire bike niche AND REGARDLESS OF REACHING OUR CAMPAIGN GOALS OR NOT WE WILL FULFILL EVERY ORDER!
...As you will see below, point by point we offer a comparable product to other mid to high end machines, complete with unparalleled warranties and customer service..But of course costing hundreds less. 
Its just how we roll, why pay more when you don't need to?  






Our CHUB Fat Tire bike has an early adopter price of only $429.00 (plus delivery) That is literally hundreds less than the nearest competitor with similar specifications..Its by far the BEST VALUE AVAILABLE!!  WHY PAY MORE? 
Our eventual full retail price of $599.00 is also way beneath the competition by a significant margin....So if you miss the boat in our early adopter specials you're still saving a bundle.

founder-director Marion Moon, a visionary young Kenyan entrepreneur, sees a
peaceful and prosperous Africa, in which our resources are managed sustainably

recognizes real opportunity in the challenges presented by issues of global
food security, climate change, and population growth.</p>
<p>Wanda’s focus is on the most
abundant natural resource we have, the soil. By bringing farmers, the very latest in bio-organic soil fertility technologies, Wanda
enables them to produce more and better food than ever before, thus increasing
profitability and family incomes, improving nutrition, creating new employment,
developing rural economies, while restoring and strengthening the health of
Africa’s soil.</p>
<p>With assistance from  the  United States Agency for International Development (USAID)  Kenya  “Feed The

rising fast. </p>

<p>Contributing to this project is an opportunity for contributors
to positively aid in the mitigation of one of the greatest challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup>
century, <b>CLIMATE CHANGE.</b> Improved plant health and growth means that more
carbon dioxide will be sequestered by plants hence reducing the amount of CO<sub>2</sub>
in the atmosphere (a greenhouse gas responsible for global warming) Improved
soil fertility and structure will also lead to an increase in the agricultural
productivity of people in Kenya and consequently improving the food security
not only of people in Africa but to the billions of people who import food from
Africa. The increased agricultural output and nutritional value of crops from the farms means that farmers can get a higher price for their produce  </p>

<p>Hi, I am Kimiko Uriu, a Tea Sommelier and one of the first Certified Tea Specialists from the Specialty Tea Institute of New York. </p>
<p>I worked for a leading Japanese tea company for several years, where I participated in each step of the tea production process - working in the tea field, factory production, tea ceremony, sales, and brand development. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I </span>continued traveling<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the world in the search of unique and delicious teas and looking for easy solutions to drink tea: </span><a href=""http://www.kimicha.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">KIMICHA Tea</a> was born. The Jin Jun Mei black tea is from the remote tea farms in the Wuyi Mountains. This unique tea <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">won an international award for the Best Black Tea. This </span>exquisite<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> tea can be re-steeped up to 6 times without getting bitter! I have found a unique and delicious set of teas where customers have said ""I am your customer for life"". By offering these unique teas from the farm to cup, people can purchase them with a good conscience, knowing that these have been carefully selected.</span></p>

</div>KIMICHA Tea offers a wide selection of fine teas from tea farmers around the world. We are the sole Canadian importers of many Chinese and Korean teas, and we love to share our passion for tea. </div><div>Our Mission is to offer teas from farm to cup, sourcing our teas from people and farms that we know well.<br/><p></p>
<h3>Higher quality tea in biodegradable tea bags</h3>After listening to the feedback from many customers, we discovered that there is a lot of demand for our high quality teas in a more convenient format.</div><div>We want to ensure the quality of our teas by packing them ourselves and make sure that the material for our tea bags is biodegradable, unlike many tea bags currently available on the market. </div><div><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What will we use the funding for?</span></div><div>
<p>We already have invested in the blends, market testing and teas. We have a location for the machine once we get it. </p>
<p>We are asking for $24,000 in funding for three key items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing natural, biodegradable filter-paper ($4,000)</li> <li>Printing new boxes and materials ($1,000)</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Purchasing a machine so we can manufacture our high quality loose leaf tea in the convenience of tea bags ($19,000)</span> </li>
</ul>
<div>Help us and become part of our story.<br/>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>You are helping a small business, while showing your support for organic, small-scale tea production:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>You get 100% natural tea - nothing artificial or synthetic</li>
<li>You will receive our tea in convenient to-go tea bags or loose leaf if you prefer</li>
<li>Show public support for organic, small-scale tea production</li>
<li>Every single backer gets their name on our thank you page</li>
<li>Once the machine has arrived, we'll package the delicious teas and sent them to you!</li>
</ul>
<div>We will deliver: convenience, great flavour and affordable tea directly from tea farmers around the world.</div>

<br/>
</div>
<p>All of the teas listed in our perks are hand-selected by Kimiko Uriu.</p>
<p>The first six teas we are converting to tea bags are our Plum Cinnamon, English Breakfast, Moroccan Mint, Lemongrass Ginger, award-winning Classic Green tea and Organic Earl Grey. All of these teas are organic and some of our customer favourites. These 6 teas will be in our sampler box (three of each flavour).</p>

<p>Farming is hard work, which requires a lot of knowledge, patience and skill. Mass-produced tea has threatened the value and price of tea. </p> <ul> <li>Shortages of skilled labour for picking the tea leaves which increase the cost of producing hand-made tea.</li>
<li>Increasingly automized or mechanized production methods that can compromise the quality of tea.</li>
<li>The high labour intensity of tea farming and volumes of scale that tea farmers have to compete with have led to many farmers giving up on tea farming and moving to becoming tea merchants instead.</li>
</ul>
<div>By buying most of our teas directly from the farms, instead of through huge brokers, we hope to help farmers become self-reliant. </div>
</div><div> <p></p>

I worked for a leading Japanese tea company for several years, where I participated in each step of the tea production process - working in the tea field, factory production, tea ceremony, sales, and brand development. 
I continued traveling the world in the search of unique and delicious teas and looking for easy solutions to drink tea: KIMICHA Tea was born. The Jin Jun Mei black tea is from the remote tea farms in the Wuyi Mountains. This unique tea won an international award for the Best Black Tea. This exquisite tea can be re-steeped up to 6 times without getting bitter! I have found a unique and delicious set of teas where customers have said ""I am your customer for life"". By offering these unique teas from the farm to cup, people can purchase them with a good conscience, knowing that these have been carefully selected.
 
KIMICHA Tea


KIMICHA Tea offers a wide selection of fine teas from tea farmers around the world. We are the sole Canadian importers of many Chinese and Korean teas, and we love to share our passion for tea. Our Mission is to offer teas from farm to cup, sourcing our teas from people and farms that we know well.
Higher quality tea in biodegradable tea bagsAfter listening to the feedback from many customers, we discovered that there is a lot of demand for our high quality teas in a more convenient format.We want to ensure the quality of our teas by packing them ourselves and make sure that the material for our tea bags is biodegradable, unlike many tea bags currently available on the market. What will we use the funding for?
We already have invested in the blends, market testing and teas. We have a location for the machine once we get it. 
We are asking for $24,000 in funding for three key items:

Purchasing natural, biodegradable filter-paper ($4,000) Printing new boxes and materials ($1,000)

Purchasing a machine so we can manufacture our high quality loose leaf tea in the convenience of tea bags ($19,000) 

Help us and become part of our story.


What's in it for you?
You are helping a small business, while showing your support for organic, small-scale tea production:


You get 100% natural tea - nothing artificial or synthetic
You will receive our tea in convenient to-go tea bags or loose leaf if you prefer
Show public support for organic, small-scale tea production
Every single backer gets their name on our thank you page
Once the machine has arrived, we'll package the delicious teas and sent them to you!

We will deliver: convenience, great flavour and affordable tea directly from tea farmers around the world.

Perks




All of the teas listed in our perks are hand-selected by Kimiko Uriu.
The first six teas we are converting to tea bags are our Plum Cinnamon, English Breakfast, Moroccan Mint, Lemongrass Ginger, award-winning Classic Green tea and Organic Earl Grey. All of these teas are organic and some of our customer favourites. These 6 teas will be in our sampler box (three of each flavour).




    

Farming is hard work, which requires a lot of knowledge, patience and skill. Mass-produced tea has threatened the value and price of tea.   Shortages of skilled labour for picking the tea leaves which increase the cost of producing hand-made tea.
Increasingly automized or mechanized production methods that can compromise the quality of tea.
The high labour intensity of tea farming and volumes of scale that tea farmers have to compete with have led to many farmers giving up on tea farming and moving to becoming tea merchants instead.

By buying most of our teas directly from the farms, instead of through huge brokers, we hope to help farmers become self-reliant. 
 
Other Ways You Can HelpIf your cupboard is already full of tea and you can't make a contribution, that's okay! You can still help us by getting the word out to anyone else you know who loves tea! We thank you for anything!

</p>
<p>In our 4.5 years of experience being in Bulgaria we found this to be true

 money in the long run.  </p>
<p>Expensive mistakes affects not only the bank account, but also the 
staff and customer experience.  And when the customer experience 
suffers, the business can't make the money to pay for those mistakes

<li>My name is Ian Carr, I was born and raised in Buffalo but I've traveled quite a bit. This city has given me a lot and I currently find myself with a unique set of skills that allows me to give back with a great addition to Buffalo. I am an experienced sculpture artist/bar tender. I have over 10 years of experience in both fields in various locations including Buffalo, NYC, and the Hamptons. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>After traveling a bit and returning home, I found that Buffalo was a city on the rise. One essential aspect of the city that I found lacking was a creative and unique environment that draws the attention of both visitors and locals. It was at this point that I devised a completely original concept for a bar that combined both of my passions, bar-tending and art, specifically glass blowing... </li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Myself and many others believe that the concept of Buffalo Glass Bar will be listed as one of the most unique bars in America. This means great exposure for Buffalo including interviews, press, and footage on tv shows geared towards unique bars, restaurants, and cocktail culture such as <i>Esquire's</i>, ""<i>most unique bars in America</i>."" Contributions in forming the Buffalo Glass Bar will aid in the development of an art district in buffalo. Our studio will give live demonstrations and tours for the community to experience and learn. Our studio doors will be open during the daytime which aids in community building by hosting field trips and visits from public schools to teach children about the production of glass as well as artwork. The Buffalo Glass Bar will act as an attraction for visitors traveling through western NY, both during the day as a studio, and at night as a spectacle of interesting cocktails and presentation.<br/>
</li> </ul>
<ul>
<br/>
<li>This type of bar will be the first of its kind, so it is hard to factor an exact dollar amount for everything. what we can figure is the cost of equipment, materials, and renovations. The funds needed will be going towards these unique pieces of equipment and the renovations that are needed to operate safely and efficiently. <br/>
</li> <br/>
<li>The deals or perks offered on this campaign are all discounted prices, including glass blowing classes, artwork, hand make glassware, and even bar memberships. One of the main concepts in the bar is that every drink and plate comes on a specifically designed and hand blown glass. These glasses will be available for purchase through the gallery however they will be at a much discounted price through this campaign. <br/>
</li> <br/>
<li>If the funds from this campaign don't reach the entire goal, we will still use everything we did raise towards the renovations and equipment, just simply joined alongside with independent loans and investors. <br/>
</li> </ul>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>The Buffalo Glass Bar could very possibly be a new change in the bar entertainment industry. This could become a new format for bars everywhere and it can all start here. Plain and simple, with your contributions, the more money we can raise here, the less we'll have to borrow from a bank at a high interest rate which isn't any fun.<br/>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <ul> <li>we understand that some people simply cant contribute financially. One alternative way you can help is to  share this page with others and spread the word to make our dream become a reality.<br/>

I have over 10 years of experience in both fields in various locations including Buffalo, NYC, and the Hamptons. 




After traveling a bit and returning home, I found that Buffalo was a city on the rise. One essential aspect of the city that I found lacking was a creative and unique environment that draws the attention of both visitors and locals. It was at this point that I devised a completely original concept for a bar that combined both of my passions, bar-tending and art, specifically glass blowing... 



Myself and many others believe that the concept of Buffalo Glass Bar will be listed as one of the most unique bars in America. This means great exposure for Buffalo including interviews, press, and footage on tv shows geared towards unique bars, restaurants, and cocktail culture such as Esquire's, ""most unique bars in America."" Contributions in forming the Buffalo Glass Bar will aid in the development of an art district in buffalo. Our studio will give live demonstrations and tours for the community to experience and learn. Our studio doors will be open during the daytime which aids in community building by hosting field trips and visits from public schools to teach children about the production of glass as well as artwork. The Buffalo Glass Bar will act as an attraction for visitors traveling through western NY, both during the day as a studio, and at night as a spectacle of interesting cocktails and presentation.
 


This type of bar will be the first of its kind, so it is hard to factor an exact dollar amount for everything. what we can figure is the cost of equipment, materials, and renovations. The funds needed will be going towards these unique pieces of equipment and the renovations that are needed to operate safely and efficiently. 
 
The deals or perks offered on this campaign are all discounted prices, including glass blowing classes, artwork, hand make glassware, and even bar memberships. One of the main concepts in the bar is that every drink and plate comes on a specifically designed and hand blown glass. These glasses will be available for purchase through the gallery however they will be at a much discounted price through this campaign. 
 
If the funds from this campaign don't reach the entire goal, we will still use everything we did raise towards the renovations and equipment, just simply joined alongside with independent loans and investors. 
 


The Buffalo Glass Bar could very possibly be a new change in the bar entertainment industry. This could become a new format for bars everywhere and it can all start here. Plain and simple, with your contributions, the more money we can raise here, the less we'll have to borrow from a bank at a high interest rate which isn't any fun.

    we understand that some people simply cant contribute financially. One alternative way you can help is to  share this page with others and spread the word to make our dream become a reality.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

What was missing was awareness, knowledge, skills and exposure to the many opportunities available world wide. So we started KWETU training centre for sustainable development in 1997, which has meanwhile trained thousands of people along the Coast in beekeeping to protect mangrove forests, development of herbal products from neem, aloe vera and moringa, methods of sustainable agriculture and of course mariculture (fish, prawns, oyster farming).</p>
<p>We want to establish KWETU as centre of excellence where people can get inspired by appropriate technology and knowledge to improve their livelihoods without destroying their natural environment. </p>
<p>Our first Eco Festival on 14th June will promote these ideas through a multitude of creative and educational activities. The festival will also be a platform to showcase what eco-friendly products, services and projects are available at the Coast.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We aim at raising 15.000 US$ with this campaign to upgrade our resource centre with internet and computers for students to reach out to the wider world. We want to improve our processing facilities for honey and other by- products e.g. propolis and we want to get quality packaging and certification for all our herbal products so that we can access the global market. </p>
<p>This means you will soon be able to purchase KWETU health products in your local markets. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>In the last 15 years we have trained thousands of women, youth and farmers in small scale agribusinesses. Unfortunately the local market is limited and producers find it increasingly difficult to sell their products. KWETU has thus decided to avail marketing services for the people we trained. We will do the quality control, packaging, certification and sales to the national and international consumers.</div> <p>Giving direct access to a wider market will ensure that producers reap the maximum benefit from their natural resources.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>In the past years we have faced and overcome many challenges but we are confident that the approach we want to take is viable and we know that we can build on the support of the many networks we have been partnering with. </p>

at once flourishing villages across their home country now falling

(khm, brainstorm, I mean). Each of them proposed to organize either a clean-up,
or an active citizenship campaign, or a Free Willy mission (do orca
whales even swim in the Black Sea?!)… but then a great idea was born.
The organizing team decided to help tackle social problems in the Ukrainian society… by traveling to rural communities and
cleaning parks and riversides from trash;
painting playgrounds;
renovating museums and other historic sights;
building infrastructure;





educating youth about opportunities;
promoting community service;
engaging different social groups.

All of that involved


1 bus;
25 volunteers of various ethnic background;
7 days of travel;
across 7 small towns and
     villages.
We have organized 3 life-changing and community helping tours in 20 Ukrainian villages so far.







― Dude, I guess the locals liked what you did for them.
― I can tell!
― But hey, where did you get the money?
― We persuaded our partners and supporters that it would work, and were
awarded FLEX alumni grant and financial aid from the U.S. Embassy in
Ukraine. We also built valuable partnerships with local and national NGOs which provided us with some in-kind support.
― Sounds cool!

― All of that was more than enough for transportation, materials, and
simple food, as we didn’t stay in hotels but at local schools using our
sleeping bags.


However, this year all
hardships and numerous challenges in Ukraine made it nearly impossible for us
to receive funding, and we turned to IndieGoGo to invite our backers to become
a part of Help and Travel history.
― Ok, folks, tell me how
you're going to spend the money!
We aim to raise an amount of
$2,500, which will cover:

renting a bus with a
     driver for 7 days;
gas for the entire
     journey (around 1000 miles);
part of food expenses for
     25 volunteers on board;
materials for work at
     locations such as paint, gloves, trash bags, brushes, etc.;
overnight stay in hostel
     for Day 0 at starting location.



― Alright, I like the idea.

We are the Seattle chapter of Sunday Assembly, a secular community whose mission is to ""live better, help often, and wonder more.""  Since September 2014, our monthly gatherings in Seattle bring people together to hear inspiring, thought-provoking ideas that will help enrich our lives and our community.  Sunday Assemblers hear from a variety of speakers on a wide range of topics, from mindfulness to foster care to community involvement.  At each service we listen, we learn, we sing, we meet new people, we drink coffee and eat cookies, and we leave feeling empowered to make the world a better, more compassionate place.

Seattle's chapter of Sunday Assembly has been up and running for a few months, but we need to keep it running!  All of our organizers are volunteers, and all our expenses are paid for with donations.  We are still a new organization just getting our feet underneath us, and your financial support helps us tremendously!

is a simple, safe and  portable innovation which promotes 


healthier cooking and will change the way you think about grilling! 
 

Best of all, it’s an  all year   grilling solution!
  INPEX 2015GOLD MEDAL WINNERInventors International Gold Medal Merit & Excellence Award!Grill-Top was selected by the ERA review 
panel at INPEX 2015 and will be showcased at the ERA D2C convention in Las Vegas 
in October 2015! Only 37 of 300+ inventors are selected.
 
 

Problem with other indoor grills……




Do you ever notice that other popular indoors grills really don’t cook the same as an outdoor grill?


Is the food missing the smoky flavors of a good outdoor BBQ?
Have you used a stove grill pan that creates a smoky mess?
That’s because they can’t BBQ food without setting off smoke alarms. Not to mention, they are messy when cooking and are hard to clean.




Solution……

 The Grill-Top indoor electric BBQ grill is the solution.  
 
 It combines the outdoor smoky grill flavors with indoor safety, convenience and easy clean-up.
 
Whether you are.....

.....Home on a raining day……You can grill !!!


.....In the snow storm in the middle of winter…..You can grill !!!

   Grill your way on any day!

 

Technology Similar to outdoor grills, our special  “patent pending” technology allows you to properly grill foods at higher temperatures.


 “Cool to the touch”,  “heat resistant” hood for safety.

 


Smoke Filtering System The hood system has a specially designed self-contained smoke filtering system with a removable filter. 


Removable Filter  Similar to an oven hood, the easy access removable filter allows for easy replacement.


 
 
 
 
 

 Healthier Cooking   Unlike most popular indoor grills, the grease falls directly off the food, through the grill grates, and into a collection tray without touching the grill surface or being absorbed into the food…Just like an outdoor grill.

 


The Story   Founder and inventor, John Donofrio, could not find an indoor grilling solution which was affordable and worked well. “The idea for Grill-Top came from my desire to buy a really good indoor grill.” “I wanted an indoor grill that worked just like an outdoor grill without overcooking the food.”In the garage, his grill concept was born. He started by making all different types of cardboard cut-outs and designs. He got some materials, drawings and power tools and started creating it. After several different designs, some better than others, he had something that worked. He spent months building different prototypes before coming up with one that worked.

 
 

The Experience   With John Donofrio’s background in safety and technology, he wanted to make the best possible product by using existing parts. So, he worked with several engineers and came up with what he felt was a great working prototype. He tested it over and over again by making meals for his family. Well, it worked. He finally had the grill he was looking for. Since it worked so well, he decided to share the idea and experience with a few friends.


The Manufacturing   So with the help of a local products company, we were able to obtain the materials and parts needed to built it. At the same time we want to offer the best quality product on the market. As we move forward with the final design, we will need to obtain UL Approval to ensure the best possible product. That is where we need your support through contributions to the campaign. If you like the idea and want to be one of first to have this outstanding invention please get involved and support us.

COFFEE. I am married to a beautiful Vietnamese women and we have a 2.5 year old little boy. My education is hospitality but my love for coffee, is finally the work i am able to do here. Vietnam is currently the 2nd biggest coffee producer in the world but very little know for its great product. We are here to change this....<br/><br/>Vietnam, a country suffering in the past, is now ready to stand on its own feed. We, foreigner which live here, need to give a helping hand on this (at least every once in a while). In my case, i try to do this in the worlds most consumed beverage, again COFFEE. Vietnam has a great coffee culture, however, due to the lack of education and greedy global players - a lot of coffee consumed by Vietnamese people is ""fake"" enriched with chemical flavors, coloring and even steroids and soy bean. Farmers Blend Coffee set a mission to bring clean, 100% natural and sustainable coffee to the people here and as a matter of fact, turn around the global image of Vietnamese Coffee.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432391996/h4vik3urdal7kc0cz1bm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>We need your help to promote and support our idea so that coffee drinkers around the world are able to support Vietnam by enjoying a delicious glass of ""ca phe sua da"" - Vietnamese Iced Coffee....<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Farmers Blend Coffee was established in November 2014 - we have a full setup of machinery and other equipment. However, we have no more liquidity to raise the bar at the moment. We need 10000 USD more which we like to put in a marketing campaign (we like to produce a movie on Vietnamese Coffee, from crop to cup, how to grow and brew this delicacy etc...incl. living and working conditions of minority people in the highlands etc...) as well as in promotion material, hand outs and the organization of local events such as ""Organic Markets"" etc. to promote our product and sustainable coffee / products in general in Vietnam. At the moment we are one of the only Coffee Roasters in Vietnam which is certified by the Rainforest Alliance. We source our coffee directly from local farms in the central highlands and have a great network of awesome people growing coffee to support family and make their living in a difficult environment. Big players such as Nes****, Star**** and other control the market and therefore the prices and the wages of local farmers. Obviously this is kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>By supporting &amp; funding our campaign and to get things done we offer a few perks for all people funding our idea.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>All funds above 100 USD get a full set of Vietnamese Coffee which includes</p>
<p>2kg of Vietnamese Coffee Blend; 2Kg of Italian Espresso Blend; a traditional Vietnamese Coffee Phin as well a the delicious sweetened condense milk used here to brew a great summer beverage ""Ca phe Sua Da""</p>
<p>All funds from 50 to 99 USD will receive:</p>
<p>1 Kg of Vietnamese Coffee incl. traditional Vietnamese Coffee Phin and 1 can of sweetened condense milk.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Third, once the movie is finished, you will be surprised on the outcome and how much work actually goes into a normal cup of coffee which you likely drink every day. Hopefully it will make you re-think your ideology and habits on your coffee consumption.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Vietnam is still a developing county, years of war and suffering - corruption is everywhere. To reach our goal, we will not spend any money on corruption - which, from our experience, can make things a lot more difficult. However, being in Vietnam a long time now, we are very familiar with the official procedures and know how to handle difficult situations. <br/>Another Challenge to overcome is the educational part of Vietnamese People. As I mention before, Vietnamese coffee is often ""fake"", this being said, Vietnamese are used to this taste and enjoy it. We realize that city people e.g. from Saigon or Hanoi are more open for real coffee as they have a better exposure to it. Countryside population still needs training.

</div></div>","Short SummaryDear fellow coffee lovers,my name is Dietmar Vogelmann, the past 6 years I am living now in Vietnam where I am finally able to follow my passion. COFFEE. I am married to a beautiful Vietnamese women and we have a 2.5 year old little boy. My education is hospitality but my love for coffee, is finally the work i am able to do here. Vietnam is currently the 2nd biggest coffee producer in the world but very little know for its great product. We are here to change this....Vietnam, a country suffering in the past, is now ready to stand on its own feed. We, foreigner which live here, need to give a helping hand on this (at least every once in a while). In my case, i try to do this in the worlds most consumed beverage, again COFFEE. Vietnam has a great coffee culture, however, due to the lack of education and greedy global players - a lot of coffee consumed by Vietnamese people is ""fake"" enriched with chemical flavors, coloring and even steroids and soy bean. Farmers Blend Coffee set a mission to bring clean, 100% natural and sustainable coffee to the people here and as a matter of fact, turn around the global image of Vietnamese Coffee.
We need your help to promote and support our idea so that coffee drinkers around the world are able to support Vietnam by enjoying a delicious glass of ""ca phe sua da"" - Vietnamese Iced Coffee....
  What We Need & What You Get Farmers Blend Coffee was established in November 2014 - we have a full setup of machinery and other equipment. However, we have no more liquidity to raise the bar at the moment. We need 10000 USD more which we like to put in a marketing campaign (we like to produce a movie on Vietnamese Coffee, from crop to cup, how to grow and brew this delicacy etc...incl. living and working conditions of minority people in the highlands etc...) as well as in promotion material, hand outs and the organization of local events such as ""Organic Markets"" etc. to promote our product and sustainable coffee / products in general in Vietnam. At the moment we are one of the only Coffee Roasters in Vietnam which is certified by the Rainforest Alliance. We source our coffee directly from local farms in the central highlands and have a great network of awesome people growing coffee to support family and make their living in a difficult environment. Big players such as Nes****, Star**** and other control the market and therefore the prices and the wages of local farmers. Obviously this is kept to a minimum.
By supporting & funding our campaign and to get things done we offer a few perks for all people funding our idea.



All funds above 100 USD get a full set of Vietnamese Coffee which includes
2kg of Vietnamese Coffee Blend; 2Kg of Italian Espresso Blend; a traditional Vietnamese Coffee Phin as well a the delicious sweetened condense milk used here to brew a great summer beverage ""Ca phe Sua Da""
All funds from 50 to 99 USD will receive:
1 Kg of Vietnamese Coffee incl. traditional Vietnamese Coffee Phin and 1 can of sweetened condense milk.



If we do not reach our goal of 10.000 USD we will use the funds to produce the movie only. To, at least, get the word out and to promote Vietnamese Coffee culture and the long tail of procedures, working- & living conditions on a coffee farm in Central Vietnam and to open peoples mind on how the integrate processes are to produce quality coffee. We hope with a movie like this that we are able to challenge peoples minds and habits on discounted cheap mass-production coffee which makes local people suffer and barley makes an income for local farmers.
  The Impact
the impact you will have by funding our campaign will be massive. First you support a young ambitious company trying to change to coffee world and challenges the status quo. 
Second, you support sustainability in the world most traded commodity, you would make a personal impact to local farmers lives and their living conditions.
Third, once the movie is finished, you will be surprised on the outcome and how much work actually goes into a normal cup of coffee which you likely drink every day. Hopefully it will make you re-think your ideology and habits on your coffee consumption.
  Risks & ChallengesVietnam is still a developing county, years of war and suffering - corruption is everywhere.

<h3>Let's buy a heap of land, and give it back to Indigenous mobs</h3>
<div>Here's an idea. Pretty soon an set of enormous tracts of private land are coming up for sale in Australia. The largest private, non-monarchical, non-state landholding on earth is up for sale. At the moment the properties are cattle farms. Let's buy them, and give them back to the Aboriginal people of Australia. </div>
<div>Read about the land here: <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3129235/The-largest-private-land-holding-earth-three-quarters-size-ENGLAND-150-people-live-sale-family-Sir-Sidney-Kidman-penniless-runaway-Australia-s-greatest-pastoralist.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3129235/The-largest-private-land-holding-earth-three-quarters-size-ENGLAND-150-people-live-sale-family-Sir-Sidney-Kidman-penniless-runaway-Australia-s-greatest-pastoralist.html</a> </div>
<div>My name's Hugo, and I'm originally from the UK. I've been living in Melbourne for 8 of the happiest years of my life. I love Australia with a passion, and every day I thank my lucky stars that I get to live here. </div>
<div>One thing I wish were different here is a better deal all round for Aboriginal people. And I really believe things are going to get better in the future with a concerted effort from everyone in the country, and overseas. There have been great strides in Native Title and all sorts of fantastic programmes across the country, but the situation for many Aboriginal people, and many of their cultures, is quite dire, so I think it would be great to do even more, and quickly. </div>
<div>That's why I think the 23,000km² of cattle farms that is coming up for sale should be bought and given back to the Aboriginal people of the areas where the land is located. And given back completely free of charge. Handed over, in every respect, title and deed, to the descendants of the people who so carefully tended to and lived in harmony with this land for so many millennia until the arrival of my ancestors a couple of hundred years ago.</div>
<div>The properties are all being sold together and the asking price is $325,000,000. So, here's the idea: everyone in the world, chip in a few bucks, and let's be the winning bidders at the auction (I've set the campaign at 340mill so that we can elevate the bid if necessary, and afford to pay for perks and Indiegogo fees). Then, when we buy the properties, we give them back to the indigenous folk of the area where they're located, and they look after them forever after.</div>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div> <p>It's pretty simple, guys: we need over $325,000,000 (let's say 340 to be safe), to buy this massive amount of land. When we've got it, we'll smash down the winning bid at the property auction and then hand over the land to the relevant aboriginal elders. </p>
<p>We'll sort out some rad rewards for donors, like souvenir t-shirts and stickers. But mainly the reward for donors is to know that your dollars went some way towards altering the course of history. That after 200 years of colonisation, the whole world got together and chipped in to buy a heap of beautiful Australian land, and give it to Aboriginal folk.</p>
<p>We can keep it out of the hands of mining companies, and give the Indigenous mobs the chance to take care of massive stretches of the continent again. </p>
<p>If we don't reach full amount, that's all good, we'll put the money towards Aboriginal health and education services nationwide. And if there's enough money, we'll buy any amount of land we can, somewhere in the country and give that back to the rightful owners</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Who knows where this campaign will go. We've all seen massive crowdfunding successes for Cat-based card games, and potato salad making. And recently a guy from London caused some great ruckus by crowdfunding to bypass the political/banking system and bail out Greece in their time of need. We've seen headlines generated through this means. So, if this campaign serves to raise awareness that Aboriginal people in Australia deserve a better deal, then that will be a great result. And, who knows, maybe there are enough 3.4 million people in the world with $100 to spare to actually make this happen for real.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There's heaps of challenges with this, of course, and as comments come in, I'll add to them and try to address them.</p>
<p>Chief among them may be:</p>
<p>1. How will the 'rightful' owners of each tract of land be found and decided upon? That's a big one. It will involve a heap of research and is a huge challenge. But if it leads to a greater understanding of the existence of the myriad nations that we collectively lump together as 'Aboriginal Australians', that too will be a win.</p>
<p>2. What happens if you don't get enough money, or don't get the winning bid? Oh, ye of little faith! Well, that's all good. Any and all funds, apart from Indiegogo fees and reward costs, will go to Aboriginal Health and Education services. And on the off-chance there's enough to buy some land, somewhere in the country, we'll buy it, and hand it over to the relevant Aboriginal elders.</p>
<p>3. How can we trust you with our money? That's a good one too. I pledge to be completely transparent in all dealings with whatever amount of money is raised. Of course, you don't really know me, so any promises I make will ring hollow. In full awareness of that, I'd like to state that helping out the Indigenous people of Australia in some way like this is one of my greatest dreams, and would be fulfilment of an ambition I've held ever since arriving in this great country, and learning something about the situation here. To be able to carry it out would be a much greater reward than any financial one.</p>
<p>More to be added as they come in. Critiques and questions are welcome.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Spread the word! As I said above, a huge part of this is in raising awareness of the needs of Indigenous folk in Australia. A lot of people feel threatened about this kind of discourse, as if giving a fair deal to Aboriginal people would somehow detract from their own standard of living. I couldn't disagree more firmly with that, but it's a debate for another time, because in the case of this particular land, it's for sale: the current owners want to move on, so no one would be affected by giving it back to the original owners. So, let's buy it, and give it back to the Indigenous mobs. </p>

My name's Hugo, and I'm originally from the UK. I've been living in Melbourne for 8 of the happiest years of my life. I love Australia with a passion, and every day I thank my lucky stars that I get to live here. 
One thing I wish were different here is a better deal all round for Aboriginal people. And I really believe things are going to get better in the future with a concerted effort from everyone in the country, and overseas. There have been great strides in Native Title and all sorts of fantastic programmes across the country, but the situation for many Aboriginal people, and many of their cultures, is quite dire, so I think it would be great to do even more, and quickly. 
That's why I think the 23,000km² of cattle farms that is coming up for sale should be bought and given back to the Aboriginal people of the areas where the land is located. And given back completely free of charge. Handed over, in every respect, title and deed, to the descendants of the people who so carefully tended to and lived in harmony with this land for so many millennia until the arrival of my ancestors a couple of hundred years ago.
The properties are all being sold together and the asking price is $325,000,000. So, here's the idea: everyone in the world, chip in a few bucks, and let's be the winning bidders at the auction (I've set the campaign at 340mill so that we can elevate the bid if necessary, and afford to pay for perks and Indiegogo fees). Then, when we buy the properties, we give them back to the indigenous folk of the area where they're located, and they look after them forever after.

What We Need & What You Get

 It's pretty simple, guys: we need over $325,000,000 (let's say 340 to be safe), to buy this massive amount of land. When we've got it, we'll smash down the winning bid at the property auction and then hand over the land to the relevant aboriginal elders. 
We'll sort out some rad rewards for donors, like souvenir t-shirts and stickers. But mainly the reward for donors is to know that your dollars went some way towards altering the course of history. That after 200 years of colonisation, the whole world got together and chipped in to buy a heap of beautiful Australian land, and give it to Aboriginal folk.
We can keep it out of the hands of mining companies, and give the Indigenous mobs the chance to take care of massive stretches of the continent again. 
If we don't reach full amount, that's all good, we'll put the money towards Aboriginal health and education services nationwide. And if there's enough money, we'll buy any amount of land we can, somewhere in the country and give that back to the rightful owners
    The Impact Who knows where this campaign will go. We've all seen massive crowdfunding successes for Cat-based card games, and potato salad making. And recently a guy from London caused some great ruckus by crowdfunding to bypass the political/banking system and bail out Greece in their time of need. We've seen headlines generated through this means. So, if this campaign serves to raise awareness that Aboriginal people in Australia deserve a better deal, then that will be a great result. And, who knows, maybe there are enough 3.4 million people in the world with $100 to spare to actually make this happen for real.
    Risks & Challenges There's heaps of challenges with this, of course, and as comments come in, I'll add to them and try to address them.
Chief among them may be:
1. How will the 'rightful' owners of each tract of land be found and decided upon? That's a big one. It will involve a heap of research and is a huge challenge. But if it leads to a greater understanding of the existence of the myriad nations that we collectively lump together as 'Aboriginal Australians', that too will be a win.
2. What happens if you don't get enough money, or don't get the winning bid? Oh, ye of little faith! Well, that's all good. Any and all funds, apart from Indiegogo fees and reward costs, will go to Aboriginal Health and Education services. And on the off-chance there's enough to buy some land, somewhere in the country, we'll buy it, and hand it over to the relevant Aboriginal elders.
3. How can we trust you with our money? That's a good one too. I pledge to be completely transparent in all dealings with whatever amount of money is raised. Of course, you don't really know me, so any promises I make will ring hollow. In full awareness of that, I'd like to state that helping out the Indigenous people of Australia in some way like this is one of my greatest dreams, and would be fulfilment of an ambition I've held ever since arriving in this great country, and learning something about the situation here. To be able to carry it out would be a much greater reward than any financial one.
More to be added as they come in. Critiques and questions are welcome.
    Other Ways You Can Help Spread the word! As I said above, a huge part of this is in raising awareness of the needs of Indigenous folk in Australia. A lot of people feel threatened about this kind of discourse, as if giving a fair deal to Aboriginal people would somehow detract from their own standard of living. I couldn't disagree more firmly with that, but it's a debate for another time, because in the case of this particular land, it's for sale: the current owners want to move on, so no one would be affected by giving it back to the original owners. So, let's buy it, and give it back to the Indigenous mobs.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Among children, under 14 years, the proportion is
higher: ~  5%. It is a developmental
disorder and therefore, as children grow up, some children (more girls) recover
on their own and the sex ratio changes from 1:1 among children, to 1 women to 4
men, among adults. While not fatal </span><i style=""color: rgb(39, 39, 39); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">per se</i><span style=""color: rgb(39, 39, 39); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">, it affects all major
dimensions of life: education, professional training, relationships, employment

self” - a deep existential suffering, spanning large part of life of many

<h1>Where?</h1>
<h4><b>India</b></h4>
<p>While Europe and North America have had many initiatives to support people who stutter, in India this movement has been sluggish, largely due to lack of awareness (that something can be done) and lack of resources. </p>
Many western countries cover stammering under some disability act but not in India. For example, the U.S.A. has a American Disability Act, which <a href=""http://stutteringtreatment.org/blog/2009/12/the-americans-with-disabilities-act-what-it-means-to-people-who-stutter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">covers any discrimination based on stuttering</a><a href=""http://stutteringtreatment.org/blog/2009/12/the-americans-with-disabilities-act-what-it-means-to-people-who-stutter/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>. </div>

</div></div>","Summary


We seek your support to run a one-year focused intervention for people who stammer (PWS) in India of all ages to strengthen self-help groups, create & distribute self-help resources, organize workshops/conferences and enrich current therapeutic practices. 


If you live in India: 
If you have an Indian bank account, please support the campaign here: https://milaap.org/campaigns/stammer - as funds in rupees can go directly to our Indian registered Section 25 non-profit bank account. If you live outside India, please support the campaign on Indiegogo! 


Who? 


The Indian Stammering Association   

The Indian Stammering Association or TISA is an empowered self-help movement for and by people who stammer.  If you are a person who stammers in India, you are already a member of TISA. It is completely volunteer run.  


TISA was founded by Dr. Sachin, a community health consultant, working in the Indian voluntary sector since 1993. Learn more about him on Stutter Talk. TISA's core-group members are Jai Prakash Sunda, Harish Usgaonker, Virendra Shirse, Amitsingh Kushwah, Vishal Gupta and Dhruv Gupta. TISA's leaders are the self-help group coordinators listed here. 
Started in 2008, TISA's purpose is to collect and disseminate relevant, correct and unbiased information for people who stammer and their families, friends and society in general. It promotes a self help group movement, where PWS learn to help each other and themselves in the ancient Indian spirit: “This Self is to be achieved through self effort!” 
TISA has held 4 National Conferences, over 30 communication workshops, and has many self-help groups around the country that meet at least once a week for 2-3 hours. It has a widely accessed blog, private Facebook group that has grown from 200 to almost 2000 members in just a year, and many whatsapp groups.

Speak: Stammering Foundation     
Speak: Stammering Foundation aims to connect and strengthen the stammering eco-system in South Asia through interventions (like this one on Indiegogo). The foundation envisions a society where stammering is understood and stammerers feel and are empowered to boldly choose their dream life. The foundation is an Indian-registered Section 25 non-profit organization (like 501(c)(3) in the U.S.) and is an Unltd Investee. It was founded by Dhruv Gupta. Learn more about him on Stutter Talk. 
Started in 2014, Speak: Stammering Foundation has collaborated with TISA on the FRIENDS Mumbai Convention and two SLP workshops.
 



What? 
What is stammering?

Stammering (or stuttering) is apparent in about 1% of all people, in India that is more than 12.5 million,  1.25 crore, Indians. Among children, under 14 years, the proportion is
higher: ~  5%. It is a developmental
disorder and therefore, as children grow up, some children (more girls) recover
on their own and the sex ratio changes from 1:1 among children, to 1 women to 4
men, among adults. While not fatal per se, it affects all major
dimensions of life: education, professional training, relationships, employment
& promotion, and contribution to society. Finally, it leads to “loss of
self” - a deep existential suffering, spanning large part of life of many
stammerers: Who am I? A stammerer or a normal person? 

Poorly understood and
rarely discussed, this particular suffering has often led to mocking,
discrimination and
media distortions.



When?
A one-year focused intervention starting August 2015 to August 2016. 




Where?
India
While Europe and North America have had many initiatives to support people who stutter, in India this movement has been sluggish, largely due to lack of awareness (that something can be done) and lack of resources. 
Many western countries cover stammering under some disability act but not in India. For example, the U.S.A. has a American Disability Act, which covers any discrimination based on stuttering. 



How?
Goal
A society which understands stammering and related issues and accommodates needs of adults who stammer and children/teens who stammer with sensitivity and equity; 

AND a community of people who stammer (both women and men) who are capable of helping themselves and are empowered to work towards creation of such a society.

Objectives

This is why on Monday I start Keep Clean Squad on my own since the city did not respond!! ​The streets of Central LA are in big need of our help. There is an excess of trash in our streets and over-flowing trash bins. It is a health issue to children, adults and our pets. Our goal is to provide a healthy, clean and safe environment to the community with our efforts in community clean up. We also want to raise awareness to the general public in doing the right thing, which is throwing trash only in trash bins.   </p><p>Yesterday I tried contacting Curren D. Price Jr. and his secretary sent me to the cities Field Deputy Mike Castillo. His secretary sent me to his email, which I sent him a detailed message about my concerns, my project and the assistance I needed from the city. Then I called Mark Ridley's office and his secretary sent me to the Mayor Eric Garcetti. His secretary finally sent me to his direct line but I got a voicemail. I left him a detailed message about my community health concern in the excess of trash in the streets and overflowing bins and how I'm starting this project to begin cleaning. I still haven't received a response. Then I contacted the Green &amp; Clean Corp Program because I really need the support to be provided with supplies to clean, a truck to load the trash and for the truck to take the waste to the correct location to dispose. Since I was NOT able to reach anyone not even to advise me where to dump the trash: I will buy the supplies myself out of pocket and with the help I can get from YOU! I will use my own vehicle to load as much trash as I can and if I really have no options in disposing of the waste in the correct location I will bring all the trash I collect to my home and wait till Friday for my garbage disposal to come pick it up!! I am determine to begin Keep Clean Squad this Monday June 8th at 11am. We are meeting on the corner of Central &amp; Washington!! I need volunteers to come out and help clean and donors to help me buy the supplies (transportation for trash to dumpster, trash bags, gloves, picker uppers, hand sanitizer...etc) to clean and at least waters for my volunteers. I want to clean 1-2hrs each time we come out to begin with. I want Keep Clean Squad to come out at least twice a month to the streets of LA and be of service! Let's do this!! Let's help keep our communities clean and safe for our children, adults and pets. Let's also build awareness for the community to make a conscientious decision into disposing of their trash only into waste bins and not into our streets.

I'm also going to California State University at San Marcos studying to get my B.S. in Global Business Management with a track in Entrepreneurship. <br/></p>
<p>The campaign you will be helping is going towards my new Mystery Shopping company that will serve those in the Cannabis industry. This is important to me because the problem is the industry is more focused on the products and less focused on the consumer. In restaurants you can have great food and an inviting atmosphere. However, without exceptional customer service how can a restaurant ultimately succeed?</p>
<p>Your contribution is your voice, join the Cannabis movement and  Mystery Patient's mission to set a standard for Patient Service in the Medical Marijuana industry here in California and soon the Nation. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Your contributions will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your perks for you to show off! </li>
<li>Trial Mystery Shops with Potential Clients--We will be traveling all over Southern California and we are not requiring Clients to reimburse our Mystery Patients. Product will be collected and then donated to patients in need.</li>
<li>Advertising--We will be running ads in local Cannabis magazines.</li>
<li>Marketing--Clothing, Hats, and other accessories will be purchased for our representatives to wear. They will post onto social media sites, attend local festivals and other events. More marketing material will also be purchased, banners, brochures, business cards, brand development. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your perks!</p>
<ol>
<li>Mystery Patient Slap Sticker to put on anything anywhere!</li>
<li>Mystery Patient T-Shirt to wear anywhere anytime!</li>
<li>Mystey Patient Hat to wear for all the hat wearers! Wear it forwards, or wear it backwards! Mystery Patient is going to be in front, so let people behind you see that!</li>
<li>Some of the packages even land your name or your business's name on our <a href=""http://www.MysteryPatientLLC.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.MysteryPatientLLC.com</a> website!</li>
</ol>
<p>The funds will be allocated accordingly if our goal is not reached! <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The Mystery Patient concept was conceived earlier this year. We were established the week of 4/20/15. One of the biggest misconception is that Mystery Patient is merely another review service. That we are not. We do not present subjective information, rather we present objective, quantifiable, and unbiased information for internal users to use so that they may take necessary actions to strive for the highest quality service possible. <br/></p>
<p>In California, the real winner is the patient. It may be my business, but the patient receives the ultimate benefit. Your contribution is helping achieve this benefit for the patient. Customer Service is still important in any business. We cannot ignore the fact that the Cannabis industry is blooming into what it truly deserves to be. And the industry has yet to see a business not focused on the product. <br/></p>
<p>I've met many people in my life who are finding great relief in Medical Marijuana. These people are going into dispensaries and calling delivery services not knowing what to expect. One may know what usually goes down, but there is no universal standard. I want nothing more than for patients all over California to know a they will have a great experience whenever picking up medicine. <br/></p>Soon once California has been covered we will begin to move into neighboring states with Medical Marijuana laws. There are plans to move into states like Colorado and Washington. But hey, Rome wasn't built...<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Since we have been established one of my biggest challenge is getting people to believe in what I believe in. Many are quick to believe that I'm a private investigator going in with a mic under my shirt and a camera on my glasses. I'm not a spy. I don't think any of the staff is stealing. While a collective has the option of a Mystery Patient returning an item to experience a ""Return."" We are not there as private investigators. We are there to assess the experience so that owners may evaluate performance. For example, if a patient expects to receive 7 grams of flower and goes home and what was received was 8 grams. The report does not state ""great experience, I was given more than I was supposed to. Our report states 7 grams of flower was acquired, 8 grams was what it had weighed out too. Mystery Patient is gathering information, not pointing a finger and wagging it.</p>
<p>I've worked in the restaurant industry for many years and I have built a genuine passion for providing customer service. When there was an upset guest I did whatever it took to make sure the guest left happy. I'm not going to give up on the patient. Just because the response so far is mixed, does not mean this challenge will not be overcome. Mystery Patient is new, and just like Cannabis itself, it will take time to grow. <br/></p>
<p>My plan to solve this challenge is to never stop believing in the mission that I personally created. I will see this company all the way to the top. If and when California and the rest of the Nation begin to move towards legalization, Mystery Patient will be ready to launch as the #1 Mystery Shopping Company for the Cannabis Industry. Join me.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Share the word! Tell people about the new service that will disrupt the entire industry! Check us out on Instagram and Facebook. Use the #MysteryPatient . And use the Indiegogo Share tools! However you help, please know one thing. <br/></p>
<p>That I'm very grateful for your support in my endeavors and for joining the movement to set a standard for Patient Service in the Cannabis Industry.<br/></p>

<p><b>Hi,</b></p>
<p>My name is Jacob Kruger. I lost my sight in a bike
accident about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>I am still a biker, and webmaster of my bike club,
and have ridden a motorbike 3 times since getting out of hospital. Twice on
parts of Phakisa raceway race track, and once just out in the open, on an
off-road bike, and all 3 times with sighted friends just guiding me around, I
did all of the riding myself, and obviously wore decent protective gear.</p>
<p>A biker at heart. ""Once a biker, always a
biker!""</p>
<p>I am a computer programmer and do web
hosting.  I program making use of following technologies: PHP, MySQL,
javascript/jQuery, HTML and Python.</p>
<p>Currently I assist other blind people with one on
one computer training and support as well as overcoming obstacles in the
everyday world at times introducing them to new products and technologies that
can make their day to day life easier.</p>
<p><b>Why do I need your help</b></p>
<p>In South Africa the blind market size is relatively
small so the prices are very high and many products are out of reach of the
average blind person due to cost of specialized items even though they are cost
effective.</p>
<p>I want to promote both awareness and availability
of various products for the blind on a cost effective scale to the South
African market and set-up a small training center catering only for the blind.</p>
<p>Currently I assist my blind brothers and sisters with
a key focus area on assistive technology and software training as we are always
relying on sighted people to assist us with technology.</p>
<p>I am only able to give one on one training due to
a  lack of funds to grow the training center. </p>
<p>With transport being an issue for us blind people
in South Africa, many of the blind people can only make certain times of the
day</p>
<p>My approach to training other people to use
software, or technology, or to help them with general problem solving has never
been to just tell them a direct answer, but rather to provide them with
guidelines, help them with the problem solving parts of process, but,
preferably help them to figure it out in their own way.</p>

<h3>How It All Started</h3><p>I started getting a lot of Facebook messages from friends, and friends of friends, asking me: “Hey, I saw you live in Bangkok and I’m coming to Thailand soon. Do you have any recommendations for nice places to visit? Something <strong>off the beaten track</strong>?”</p><p>Through these messages, I realized that there was a real demand in people wanting to travel and<strong> feel like a local</strong> rather than like a tourist. Travellers want to connect with someone who is living in the place they visit– whether that person is a local or an expat.</p><p>I happened to have a lot of contacts of locals and expats who already knew the city very well, are friendly and had some time to spare. I figured they’d love to share their passion and earn some extra money! So I started thinking about how I could connect travellers with locals via a platform.</p><h3>

How It All StartedI started getting a lot of Facebook messages from friends, and friends of friends, asking me: “Hey, I saw you live in Bangkok and I’m coming to Thailand soon. Do you have any recommendations for nice places to visit? Something off the beaten track?”Through these messages, I realized that there was a real demand in people wanting to travel and feel like a local rather than like a tourist. Travellers want to connect with someone who is living in the place they visit– whether that person is a local or an expat.I happened to have a lot of contacts of locals and expats who already knew the city very well, are friendly and had some time to spare. I figured they’d love to share their passion and earn some extra money! So I started thinking about how I could connect travellers with locals via a platform.
Our Concept
Fed up with the classic tour operators telling you when and where to go and how long to stay when you are on holidays?What you want is to run away from the tourist traps and:

Escape from inflexible group tours and get to know what is behind the endless clichés?


Discover new horizons and a different angle of the local culture without getting stuck in a crowded bus full of tourists?


Explore unique local spots and alternative places with passionate locals, at a reasonable price?

If the answers to these questions is YESSSSSS! Very Local Trip is what you need!Our ambition is to redefine the concept of travelling.Very Local Trip is an innovative collaborative platform that brings together travellers seeking unique/local experiences and ""local friends"" looking to make additional income by providing their own customized local experiences and friendly companionship.More and more travellers are looking for authenticity during their holidays or stays in countries that they sometimes visit for the first time. The best way to know a country is to discover it with local people by going off the beaten tracks of traditional tourism. Do you want to try Muay Thai with a local for 2 hours in Bangkok? Or just spend the day visiting the city with a local who will show you his/her favorite and secret places?These are only some of the services proposed on Verylocaltrip.com.How It WorksHere is one of the many experiences we offer:2 days / 1 night immersive village trip in Sakon Nakhon, the 'City of Indigo'.

Si votre réponse est OUIIIIIIIIIIII, Very Local Trip est ce qu'il vous faut !Notre ambition est de redéfinir le concept même de voyage.
Very Local Trip est une plateforme collaborative innovante qui met en relation des voyageurs - désirant voyager vraiment différemment - avec des locaux partout dans le monde !De plus en plus de voyageurs recherchent l’authenticité lors de leurs vacances ou séjour dans un pays qu’ils visitent parfois pour la première fois. Le meilleur moyen de connaitre un pays est de le découvrir avec les locaux en sortant des sentiers battus du tourisme traditionnel. Vous souhaitez vous essayez à la Boxe Thai avec un local pendant 2h à Bangkok ? Ou tout simplement passer la journée à visiter la ville avec un local qui vous montre ses endroits préférés ? Ce sont les services qui sont proposés sur verylocaltrip.com.Chez Very Local Trip, nous sommes convaincus que l'économie collaborative va continuer à se développer rapidement et va modifier en profondeur le paysage économique mondial, mais également les habitudes de consommation grâce à la volonté de ces individus qui désirent se rapprocher, s'entraider et trouver une alternative à la consommation de masse.

Voici un exemple d'expérience que nous offrons :2 jours / 1 nuit d'immersion à Sakon Nakhon, la 'Ville de l'Indigo' en Thaïlande. Une véritable expérience locale.Réservez dès maintenant et supportez un projet de communauté locale sur verylocaltrip.com Des voyageurs croient déjà en nous.
Ce Dont Nous Avons BesoinJusqu'à maintenant, nous nous auto-financions. Il est désormais temps de nous développer et de faire connaître Very Local Trip tout autour du Monde. C'est pourquoi nous avons besoin de vous !Développement informatique :Un an après avoir lancé notre site web et un mois après avoir lancé une version plus fonctionnelle et pratique, verylocaltrip.com est toujours très basique et bénéficierait de quelques améliorations avancées. Nous avons donc besoin d'engager un expert en informatique pour améliorer le site web. Nous avons aussi besoin de cet expert pour créer une application pour smartphone afin d'être plus proches de vous et plus aptes à répondre à vos besoins. C'est ce dont nous avons le plus besoin et c'est donc là-dedans que la plupart de vos donations iront.  => 12000 $Communication et marketing :Nous n'avons toujours pas déboursé un centime pour la communication. Mais pour gagner de la visibilité et rendre Very Local Trip connu autour du monde, il est temps de s'y mettre. Nous voulons nous focaliser sur la communication numérique mais pour cela, il nous faut des fonds. Nous allons avoir besoin de communication et de marketing afin d'attirer des voyageurs intéressés par notre concept ainsi que des locaux désireux de rejoindre une telle communauté mais n'en ayant toujours pas entendu parler. => 1900 $Avec Very Local Trip, nous sommes prêts à perturber la scène globale du voyage et nous comptons sur vous pour y participer. Redonnons vie à l'authenticité de rencontrer des personnes différentes et de partager notre culture partout où nous allons.Une brève explication de notre stratégie de crowdfunding : Nous avons défini un objectif raisonnable (13900 $) afin de mettre en valeur ce dont nous avons absolument besoin maintenant. En fait, nous avons besoin de plus d'argent pour développer davantage les projets mentionnés ci-dessus. Donc, s'il vous plait ne pensez pas que nous n'avons plus besoin de votre aide si nous avons déjà dépassé notre objectif. Ce n'est que la première étape d'une longue série. Le développement additionnel de nos projets consistera à :

Attirer des talents clés à travailler avec nous


Participer à des salons et exhibitions en rapport avec le tourisme et l'économie collaborative afin d'augmenter notre visibilité (exemple : l'exposition commerciale TBEX à Bangkok pour 700 $)


Organiser des rencontres avec toute notre communauté de locaux afin de renforcer les liens


Organiser des événements locaux à propos du tourisme collaboratif


Louer un endroit de travail plus convenable

Payer les frais de bureau, de fournitures, de transports, etc...

<p>For the past few years, I
knew that without consistent dedication and time for Pendo Kenia we would need
years to reach our goals.</p>
<p> <b>Our aim is to save
a life or make it at least worthwhile to live! </b></p>
<p>So I can´t say: Okay let´s
do it step by step and see where we are going, as our help would come too late
and the children would suffer. I need to work harder to give those children
their future back!</p>
<p>Thats why I have
established a sustainable plan for the surrounding communities, the teachers
and the organization to finally get an income and make it easier for all of us
to be independent and work on our goals . <b>In 2016 we plan to start a
sustainable community Moringa, Neem and vegetable farm business </b>by educating the community in
permaculture and other sustainable ways to be independent. </p>
<p>To get to this point I will
need the support from you. The money I am asking for will allow me to get
everything started in one year. Most of all it will give me the time to search
for partners, do the project management, fly to Kenya to start the Farm and to
educate the communities about permaculture and our business. </p>

donation we got in the last years was for the children. Everything you are
donating in future for our school projects goes 100% to our children and schools . But as an

will have a income for the people who are working for the wellbeing of the

additional requested funding of up to R1, 200, 000 ($93, 400) will serve to
maintain a positive cash flow in case of the immanent big order. Marketing
costs for a specialised product range such as this could run quite high
considering an advert (marketing video) would set one back R70, 000 ($5, 400)
if properly done.

<p>Advertising in Africa can be quite difficult and expensive especially for many start-ups. Prices for ads can be so high, it almost becomes impossible to make returns. We have come up with a perfect solution for start-up businesses to advertise on our website and reach a larger audience. It costs them the equivalent of $20 per month to have an online shop with us, where they can sell their products or advertise their services.  We have many artists who make traditional crafts, e.g. basket weaving, wooden sculptures, painting, textiles, jewelry etc. These people often find it difficult to reach customers and we feel that Apeepuu will bring them into the global market.</p>

</div></div>","BEHIND OUR NAME
The word 'apeepuu ' (pronounced apay-pu) is an African saying. It is what a mother tells her child when she wants the child to climb on her back, so likewise we are asking small businesses across Africa to climb on our website and we will support them (as depicted by our logo).

OUR INSPIRATION
What makes us who we are...

We aspire to be a true reflection of all African mothers...

 




ABOUT US?
www.apeepuu.com is simply an online market place for Africa. 
As a company we have created an online platform for small to medium sized businesses and organizations that are based in Africa.
Our goal is to use the internet's reach to bring together experts and those who need their help.  Apeepuu's unique platform is tailored to make the user's experience as close as possible to a face to face meeting.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
apeepuu.com allows businesses to upload pictures relating to their business, along with a company description, contact details and company video profile or presentation. Doing so will make it easier for people to find them online and it will enable them to reach both the younger customer and the more affluent customer.
We really feel that the platform we have created will be especially beneficial to thousands of start- ups or small - medium sized companies in Africa. Apeepuu aims to put customers from all parts of the world (including other African countries) in contact with the services they require in Africa. We feel like this project is the key that will open doors to many African small companies. It will encourage young people to start up their own businesses and support themselves and their communities. This campaign for us, is everything, we feel like your contribution will help us achieve our goals and fulfill our dreams


WE SUPPORT LOCALBUSINESSES





Advertising in Africa can be quite difficult and expensive especially for many start-ups. Prices for ads can be so high, it almost becomes impossible to make returns. We have come up with a perfect solution for start-up businesses to advertise on our website and reach a larger audience. It costs them the equivalent of $20 per month to have an online shop with us, where they can sell their products or advertise their services.  We have many artists who make traditional crafts, e.g. basket weaving, wooden sculptures, painting, textiles, jewelry etc. These people often find it difficult to reach customers and we feel that Apeepuu will bring them into the global market.





WE SUPPORT LOCAL & INTERNATIONALCUSTOMERS
We want to give our customers plenty of choice and variety. With your assistance, we will develop Apeepuu so that customers will be able to:


Buy events tickets
Pay their phone and electricity bill
Browse local businesses
Order take out
Read other customers' reviews and recommendations
Buy products such as clothing, jewelry and crafts
Make travel arrangements and book accommodation within Africa
Find schools and hospitals in their locality
Get information about upcoming events

And much more!

</p><h1><b>Get Hooked on Play at Neverland Beach Resort</b></h1>
<p><i>Welcome to Neverland Beach, the world’s first play focused,
democratically run eco-resort. We’re ready to revolutionize the resort industry
and give you an adventurous and beautiful place to play. Located on the
stunning beaches of Southern Belize, this is the brain child of me (Kristin
Harling) and my family.</i></p><p><i>*Please note, the setup process of internet on this remote land has proven to be time consuming. We will respond to questions and comments as soon as possible.</i></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435719311/vvtjvnvxwgk4gymy5sfl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I first came to Belize in 1996 as a college student. That's me on the right. I fell
in love right away and have been working toward getting back to stay ever since.
Over the years we have made a number of friends and connections to assist us in
our venture. Six visits later, my husband, Nathan, and I have settled on the
gorgeous and peaceful village of Monkey River Town for our family of six. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435719370/ehge0xakshxx8wgxiyvw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This is Monkey River, one of the most beautiful places on the earth, teeming with wildlife. It’s a small village of about 250. We feel so blessed to be a part of this sweet, loving, gentle community, and we know you’re going to love it too – just wait until you experience the cooking, the fishing, and the cool boat trips up the river. We promise you will learn and play a LOT!<br/></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435637616/i7h0z5zdisiyaestdkfd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our incredible team brings a host of skills to the table. I
started and ran a cloth diaper service in the upstate of South Carolina. I also
helped start a democratic school near Asheville, NC. Nathan has extensive
skills in computers and graphic design. Scott is a successful contractor in
addition to being a certified SCUBA dive instructor. Natalie is the world
renowned Play Doctor and author of the recently released <i>Just Play with It</i>. Her research on Play is right there on the
leading edge. Karen is a certified permaculture designer. She has also done
extensive Natural Building work and studies and is currently studying to be a
Journeyman so she will officially be able to do everything!</p>
<p>Our community here in Belize is equally impressive. You can
meet master drummer and teacher, Emmeth Young, founder of Drums, Not Guns, an
organization teaching kids drumming and self-respect to keep them away from
gangs and drugs. Jerry Enriquez has been a hero of mine since he was my
academic director in 1996. He is currently the Belize Program Director for
Ecology Project International, an experiential education organization designed
to get kids out in the field with real scientists doing real research. We have
a host of connections to master craftsmen and women, as well as local tour
guides with intimate knowledge of both the ecology and the culture who are
deeply excited to share the rivers, jungles, ancient chocolate making techniques, caves, secret fishing spots, and
Mayan ruins with you. </p>
<p>We have just sold everything we own and moved our family to
Monkey River Town, Belize. We have put a substantial down payment on a
beautiful piece of land right on the white, sandy beach near the village. Now
we need your help to get the rest of the down payment and build a resort where
we can all play together. </p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435637864/qlmpwvxdnguplf4tl4iw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><b>OUR VISION</b></h2><h3><b>PLAY</b></h3>
<p>We firmly believe in the value of play. Have you ever been
coloring or dancing or playing music and completely lost sense of time, feeling deeply connected to yourself and whoever you’re playing
with? This is what we want to foster at Neverland Beach. This is not lip
service. We are SERIOUS about play! ;p</p>
<p>How serious, you ask? Well, toys, music and books appear to
be about 25% of our budget, which we are pretty sure is a record. Kayaks, water
and land trampolines, water polo, water guns, kite boards, SUP, seadoo, waboba
(trust us!), a natural pool, an art treehouse with more art supplies than I am
interested in listing, a video game treehouse with pretty much every gaming
system ever made and more games than I knew existed, a projector and screen for
movies, a giant room for said movies and also for playing music/dancing/yoga, a
superfly sound system with an extensive music library, a very extensive book
library, a basketball court, table tennis, billiards table, volleyball net,
Frisbee golf course, an air hockey table, a soccer field (don’t call it that
here, though), and a dart board. </p><p>Have you ever seen a water trampoline?! This is going to be so much fun!<br/></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435638109/bc7ewrrz78r9nyzgzkl8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We wonder why there aren’t more – or any – resorts like
this. </p>
<p>This is in addition to options to go on a number of
adventures off the property: world class SCUBA diving with certified SCUBA
instructor, Scott Harling, world class fishing, birding, drum lessons, and
cave, jungle, chocolate making (you won't believe how good this stuff is), river, and mayan ruins tours with local Belizeans with vast knowledge
of the land, animals, and traditions. I don’t know of any place in the world
this devoted to play. We also intend to have regular playshops with the world
renowned Play Doctor. We believe conscious play is not just the most fun way to
live but also a spiritual practice and a way to bring joy back to families. Our
greatest wish is for you to come here and remember why you love your kids, your
spouse, and yourself.  </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435638190/my8uc9tnwd1y3ylfxzmo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><b>SUSTAINABILITY</b></h3>
<p>We want people to play all day and be filled with joy and
fall in love with each other again. We also want it to be done sustainably. In
all the versions of that word. Belize is so incredibly gorgeous, and we want to
do everything we can to keep it that way. So we will be completely off the
grid, fully supplied by rainwater, with a greywater system and composting
toilets. As much food as possible will come from the land, and the whole thing
is tied together with a permaculture design.  This does not mean the resort will not be
luxurious. We are planning to have elegant hanging beds with 100% organic
circular king size mattresses, stylish (and local!) furnishings, and regal
steam showers. We believe sustainable and luxurious are not mutually exclusive.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435639251/ymi7ixjiki3vu40f8ncz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><b>DEMOCRACY</b></h3>
<p>Sustainability includes people too. All employees will be
paid living wages and will also have a vote on the Neverland Beach Council. All
decisions of running Neverland Beach will be made by this council. We are
currently in the process of working out a profit sharing situation with the
village. </p>
<p>We believe some of the disastrous failures of the “too big
to fail” businesses are a good indicator that perhaps it is time to change the
business model to something a little more community based, something a little
less top down. So, in addition to the council, we have set up a proposal system
where anyone, anywhere can submit a proposal regarding something we could do or
change or add. The council will vote on every proposal submitted. Many minds
are better than one! </p>
<h2><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></h2>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our initial goal is what we need to get started. Financing
land is both far less common and far more expensive here in Belize than in the
US. We have been lucky to get a 2 year owner financing deal, but that means we
will need to come up with a lot of money in that short time. We have invested everything from the sale of our home, cars, and business in the US in this adventure. Here’s the
breakdown of the initial $161,000:</span></p>
<p>$33,752 – 1<sup>st</sup> 6 months of land payments</p>
<p>$30,526 – Kitchen tools, appliances, supplies, and the first
year of food, bar, and  </p>
<p>  cleaning
items</p>
<p>$25,000 – remainder of down payment</p>
<p>$19,634 – Basic furnishings and linens for both yurts</p>
<p>$14,000 – Legal fees and taxes for land purchase</p>
<p>$10,000 – Initial marketing push</p>
<p>$ 6,000 – Small, simple boat</p>
<p>$ 5,600 – Indiegogo fees</p>
<p>$ 5,000 – Shipping</p>
<p>$ 3,000 – Utilities and gas for the first year</p>
<p>$ 3,000 – Perk fulfillment and shipping</p>
<p>$ 2,585 – Licensing and Permits</p>
<p>$ 2,373 – Lawn mower, chicken supplies, and basic garden and
power tools </p>
<p>This leaves us $530 for beer! That should last a good six
months!</p>
<p>If we do not reach this goal, we will use what we have to
make this work. We are committed to this project. As I mentioned above, we have
sold most everything we owned in the US and shipped the rest down here, so we
are here to stay. Anyone who knows me will tell you that, once I devote myself
to a project, I am in it for the long haul. I’m also known far and wide for my
ability to stretch a dollar. This is why those numbers above are so low. I am a
profoundly amazing money manager!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435715861/einapogflbq8bxntj5l1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Yurt as it currently looks.</p>
<h3>STRETCH GOALS</h3>
<h4>$341,000 PLAY STRETCH</h4>
<p>After the basics for opening up, our next goal is all the
toys! After all, this is one thing that REALLY separates us from other resorts!
This will include finishing the rec center, building the natural pool, kayaks,
water trampoline, other water toys, land trampoline, volleyball net, soccer
(don’t call it that here!) goals, Frisbee golf set, treehouses, art supplies,
video games and other media toys, music (recorded and instruments), basketball
court, loads of books, table tennis table, air hockey table, billiards table,
and dart board. And of course paying to ship all that here will also not be
free.  </p>
<p>We will be introducing some new toy perks for this stretch!!
I’ll let you wait for the details, but we will have stickers, the most amazing
book on play ever written, and a fabulous playshop!</p>

<h4>$456,000 OFF THE GRID STRETCH</h4>
<p>This will go to the purchase of our solar/wind system,
rainwater catchment system, composting toilets, and gray water system. Our
ecological commitment is another thing that really sets us apart!</p>
<p>There will be some REALLY COOL new perks for this stretch.
Those of you wanting to experience this beautiful place and also learn more
about Permaculture and living off the grid will want to pay attention to these
perks! There will also be some super fly, eco-friendly toys and deliciousness.</p>
<h4>$606,000 LUXURY CABANA STRETCH</h4>
<p>When we get to $606,000, we will be able to build the luxury
cabana. There is currently a Yurt for you to stay in when you come visit, but
it’s kinda small, kinda old, and definitely not luxurious. Using natural
building materials and employing the labor of our children and friends will
allow us to keep this expense lower ;) It is at this point, though, that we will
need to begin hiring permanent staff. </p>
<p>Lowering our building costs means more lovely amenities for
your beautiful cabana! Have you ever seen a sauna/steam shower? Check it out:</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435640765/vpulvkmik2qwjfpakfks.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Then, the hanging bed:</p>

<p>WHAT?! I know, right? You definitely want to stay here. And,
yes, we’re putting an organic mattress on that bad boy. Now, close your eyes
and feel the breeze, smell the salt, hear the waves! Paradise FOUND!</p>
<p>The stretches here will, of course, be luxury related. You
will want the yumminess perk for this goal for sure!!</p>
<h4>$701,000 THE NEVERLAND FAMILY GETS A HOUSE!</h4>
<p>There is another yurt on the land that we can live in for
now, but it is one circular room … and there are six of us. And again, it’s
kinda old. SO, we would love to have a little permanent structure that would
give each of our kids their own room and an office for the Neverland Beach
business. Again, we will be using natural building materials and the labor of
our families, friends, and students, so we can keep costs low. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435641039/wocyc3s3dxsbl3sthyy7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There will be fun and silly, more personal perks added for
this stretch. </p>
<p>Here’s the overall budget broken down in a completely
different way just to confuse you and also allow us to have fun with pie charts
on Excel. </p>
<p>

<h2><b>IMPACT</b></h2>
<p>I almost don’t have words for the impact this will have on
my family and me. This has been my dream for quite a long time, and I am so
deeply grateful for the support of our community in bringing this dream into
form. I believe we are going to do really great work at Neverland Beach and
that it is going to be a place that brings many people profound joy and
healing. </p>
<p>For the country of Belize, I believe another prosperous,
truly sustainable resort has a tremendous impact in proving that ecotourism
brings in more dollars that stay here in Belize than putting up big hotels and
condos. And those dollars have a huge impact on the people of the local
communities where, not only will you spend your dollars, but also where we will
spend ours. Monkey River Town was once a much larger, thriving town, and we are
very excited to be a part of its big comeback with opportunities to
make good money, not only fishing, but also doing tours, hosting additional
guests, feeding people, and selling beautiful crafts. We are also in the
process of working out a profit sharing deal with the village. This is in
addition to the profit sharing with our employees. Neverland Beach can make a
big impact on Monkey River Town, and Monkey River Town has made a tremendous impact on us.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is very little impact on this
ecosystem. Here you have reef, beach, river, mangroves, and islands, all in
very close proximity. These are delicate ecosystems, so we are taking great
care to ensure this land is just as beautiful for generations to come. </p>
<p>For those who come to visit, we believe the impact will be
tremendous. The culture, the land, the water, the animals, the people – it’s
all beautiful here. Belize was ranked by National Geographic Traveller as one
of the top ten happiest countries in the world. The weather is beautiful. It’s
always warm. There’s almost always a breeze. The things you will see here will
absolutely blow the top off your imagination. Just the sheer variety of what
you can experience is far more than you could ever do in a week or two. You
could also very contentedly spend the whole two weeks in a hammock drinking
coconut water - with or without rum. On top of that, there is so much opportunity for play and
adventure with family and friends. We firmly believe many relationships will be
healed here as people play together, surrounded by joy.  </p>
<h2><b>CHALLENGES/RISKS </b></h2>
<p>So, this is the rainforest, which means it rains a good bit.
Even during the rainy season, it is often sunny for most of the day. However,
the amount of rain can vary and can lengthen construction time. </p>
<p>There are also hurricanes, and though it is very uncommon
for a hurricane to hit full force in the southern part of Belize, it is always
possible. That would certainly be a setback. </p>
<p>Bureaucracy can be somewhat hairy here at times. It is not
insurmountable, but it does require patience, persistence, knowledge, and
money. </p>
<p>Anyone who knows me will tell you that I am doggedly
persistent. I am beyond committed to this project and will go to the ends of
the earth to see it through. We have sold almost everything we own to make our
life here, so we will do what needs to be done to make it work. </p>
<h2><b>WHAT YOU GET, AKA PERKS</b></h2>
<p><b><i>Here are more detailed descriptions and pictures of our initial perks! Please note that more perks will
be released as we hit new stretch goals, so check back often!</i></b></p>

<p><b>$200 ONE WEEK STAY WITH WORK TRADE!</b> What?! Seriously?!
Yes!!! Come spend a week with us in the current state of the resort for just a

can do! This cost is per adult. Children are $100 and are of course not
required to work. Please do separate contributions for each adult and the $100
add-on for each child. The lodgings will vary depending on when you come and
where we are in the process. You will most likely be staying in the yurt but
may or may not have fancy things. We’ll let you know when you schedule so you
know what to bring. Breakfast will be provided. You are welcome to buy food and
use the kitchen for lunch or have lunch with any number of amazing cooks in
Monkey River Town for $5 or $6. Dinner at the resort is $10 per adult. Kids eat
free. Again, you’re always welcome to head over to the village to eat as well. A

learning” portion. All meals and materials will be provided. You are welcome to
bring a tent or just bring a camping mat and share the floor of the yurt with
your fellow students! Please note that, though Karen has completed both
Permaculture 1 and Permaculture 2, she is not certified to give you a
Permaculture Designer Certificate. Same knowledge, but without the paper.  Please add $100 per child if you need
childcare for the week using the $100 ADD A CHILD! perk above. </p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p><b>$850 ONE WEEK NATURAL BUILDING WORKSHOP!</b> Come learn natural
building techniques with Karen and a host of other local builders who’ve been
doing natural building the way their ancestors did for thousands of years
before them! This is a really awesome opportunity to learn to work with a
number of different materials and learn to create a structure that can
withstand a number of challenges (rain, humidity, sand, salt, hurricanes, and
intense heat). You’ll also get the opportunity to see some of the local natural
buildings. AND you get to help build one of our structures!!!!!</p>
<p>As with the Permaculture Workshop, all meals and materials
are provided. Lodging is camping (byot!) or on the floor of the yurt with your
fellow workshoppers. Please use the $100 ADD A CHILD! perk for each child if
you will need childcare for the week. </p>

<p><b>$1200 ONE WEEK FOR FOUR IN THE YURT WITH THREE ADVENTURES!</b>
Don’t feel like doing work trade on your vacation? We get that! Come stay in
the yurt while work is being done at the resort and get a tremendous discount!
Furnishings and amenities will vary depending on when you come. This means you
may or may not have fancy stuff. Once it gets close to time for you to come, we
will let you know what the furnishings situation is so you can plan
appropriately. If you are more than 4 in your clan (we get that too!), just do
the $100 add-on for each additional child. Breakfast will be provided. You are
welcome to buy food and use the kitchen for lunch or eat over in the village
with any number of amazing cooks for $5 or $6. Dinner at the resort is $10 per

<p><b>$6000 NEVERLAND WEDDING AND HONEYMOON!</b> Well, it won’t be
the first wedding because the Neverland Dad and I never actually had a real
wedding, so we get to do it first! It’s still going to be amazing, though! We
will provide a minister (or perhaps a scurvy dog boat captain), a bouquet,
decorations, chairs, food, and alcohol for you, your spouse-to-be and 10
guests. Please know we are not set up at this time to house that many people,
so your guests will need to stay either in Monkey River Town or Placencia.
We will also provide boat or vehicle transportation for your guests to the
wedding. AND you get one week in the Luxury Cabana with five adventures. See
above perks for more info about our cabana, adventures, meal plan, and onsite
activities. Your guests are welcome to come play at the resort for the week you
are with us! Sounds like a good time, right?! </p>

<h2>THANKS FOR READING ALL THE WAY!</h2>
</div></div>","Get Hooked on Play at Neverland Beach Resort
Welcome to Neverland Beach, the world’s first play focused,
democratically run eco-resort. We’re ready to revolutionize the resort industry
and give you an adventurous and beautiful place to play. Located on the
stunning beaches of Southern Belize, this is the brain child of me (Kristin
Harling) and my family.*Please note, the setup process of internet on this remote land has proven to be time consuming. We will respond to questions and comments as soon as possible.

I first came to Belize in 1996 as a college student. That's me on the right. I fell
in love right away and have been working toward getting back to stay ever since.
Over the years we have made a number of friends and connections to assist us in
our venture. Six visits later, my husband, Nathan, and I have settled on the
gorgeous and peaceful village of Monkey River Town for our family of six. This is Monkey River, one of the most beautiful places on the earth, teeming with wildlife. It’s a small village of about 250. We feel so blessed to be a part of this sweet, loving, gentle community, and we know you’re going to love it too – just wait until you experience the cooking, the fishing, and the cool boat trips up the river. We promise you will learn and play a LOT!

Our incredible team brings a host of skills to the table. I
started and ran a cloth diaper service in the upstate of South Carolina. I also
helped start a democratic school near Asheville, NC. Nathan has extensive
skills in computers and graphic design. Scott is a successful contractor in
addition to being a certified SCUBA dive instructor. Natalie is the world
renowned Play Doctor and author of the recently released Just Play with It. Her research on Play is right there on the
leading edge. Karen is a certified permaculture designer. She has also done
extensive Natural Building work and studies and is currently studying to be a
Journeyman so she will officially be able to do everything!
Our community here in Belize is equally impressive. You can
meet master drummer and teacher, Emmeth Young, founder of Drums, Not Guns, an
organization teaching kids drumming and self-respect to keep them away from
gangs and drugs. Jerry Enriquez has been a hero of mine since he was my
academic director in 1996. He is currently the Belize Program Director for
Ecology Project International, an experiential education organization designed
to get kids out in the field with real scientists doing real research. We have
a host of connections to master craftsmen and women, as well as local tour
guides with intimate knowledge of both the ecology and the culture who are
deeply excited to share the rivers, jungles, ancient chocolate making techniques, caves, secret fishing spots, and
Mayan ruins with you. 
We have just sold everything we own and moved our family to
Monkey River Town, Belize. We have put a substantial down payment on a
beautiful piece of land right on the white, sandy beach near the village. Now
we need your help to get the rest of the down payment and build a resort where
we can all play together. 

OUR VISIONPLAY
We firmly believe in the value of play. Have you ever been
coloring or dancing or playing music and completely lost sense of time, feeling deeply connected to yourself and whoever you’re playing
with? This is what we want to foster at Neverland Beach. This is not lip
service. We are SERIOUS about play! ;p
How serious, you ask? Well, toys, music and books appear to
be about 25% of our budget, which we are pretty sure is a record. Kayaks, water
and land trampolines, water polo, water guns, kite boards, SUP, seadoo, waboba
(trust us!), a natural pool, an art treehouse with more art supplies than I am
interested in listing, a video game treehouse with pretty much every gaming
system ever made and more games than I knew existed, a projector and screen for
movies, a giant room for said movies and also for playing music/dancing/yoga, a
superfly sound system with an extensive music library, a very extensive book
library, a basketball court, table tennis, billiards table, volleyball net,
Frisbee golf course, an air hockey table, a soccer field (don’t call it that
here, though), and a dart board. Have you ever seen a water trampoline?! This is going to be so much fun!

We wonder why there aren’t more – or any – resorts like
this. 
This is in addition to options to go on a number of
adventures off the property: world class SCUBA diving with certified SCUBA
instructor, Scott Harling, world class fishing, birding, drum lessons, and
cave, jungle, chocolate making (you won't believe how good this stuff is), river, and mayan ruins tours with local Belizeans with vast knowledge
of the land, animals, and traditions. I don’t know of any place in the world
this devoted to play. We also intend to have regular playshops with the world
renowned Play Doctor. We believe conscious play is not just the most fun way to
live but also a spiritual practice and a way to bring joy back to families. Our
greatest wish is for you to come here and remember why you love your kids, your
spouse, and yourself.  

SUSTAINABILITY
We want people to play all day and be filled with joy and
fall in love with each other again. We also want it to be done sustainably. In
all the versions of that word. Belize is so incredibly gorgeous, and we want to
do everything we can to keep it that way. So we will be completely off the
grid, fully supplied by rainwater, with a greywater system and composting
toilets. As much food as possible will come from the land, and the whole thing
is tied together with a permaculture design.  This does not mean the resort will not be
luxurious. We are planning to have elegant hanging beds with 100% organic
circular king size mattresses, stylish (and local!) furnishings, and regal
steam showers. We believe sustainable and luxurious are not mutually exclusive.
DEMOCRACY
Sustainability includes people too. All employees will be
paid living wages and will also have a vote on the Neverland Beach Council. All
decisions of running Neverland Beach will be made by this council. We are
currently in the process of working out a profit sharing situation with the
village. 
We believe some of the disastrous failures of the “too big
to fail” businesses are a good indicator that perhaps it is time to change the
business model to something a little more community based, something a little
less top down. So, in addition to the council, we have set up a proposal system
where anyone, anywhere can submit a proposal regarding something we could do or
change or add. The council will vote on every proposal submitted. Many minds
are better than one! 
WHAT WE NEED
Our initial goal is what we need to get started. Financing
land is both far less common and far more expensive here in Belize than in the
US. We have been lucky to get a 2 year owner financing deal, but that means we
will need to come up with a lot of money in that short time. We have invested everything from the sale of our home, cars, and business in the US in this adventure. Here’s the
breakdown of the initial $161,000:
$33,752 – 1st 6 months of land payments
$30,526 – Kitchen tools, appliances, supplies, and the first
year of food, bar, and  
  cleaning
items
$25,000 – remainder of down payment
$19,634 – Basic furnishings and linens for both yurts
$14,000 – Legal fees and taxes for land purchase
$10,000 – Initial marketing push
$ 6,000 – Small, simple boat
$ 5,600 – Indiegogo fees
$ 5,000 – Shipping
$ 3,000 – Utilities and gas for the first year
$ 3,000 – Perk fulfillment and shipping
$ 2,585 – Licensing and Permits
$ 2,373 – Lawn mower, chicken supplies, and basic garden and
power tools 
This leaves us $530 for beer! That should last a good six
months!
If we do not reach this goal, we will use what we have to
make this work. We are committed to this project. As I mentioned above, we have
sold most everything we owned in the US and shipped the rest down here, so we
are here to stay. Anyone who knows me will tell you that, once I devote myself
to a project, I am in it for the long haul. I’m also known far and wide for my
ability to stretch a dollar. This is why those numbers above are so low. I am a
profoundly amazing money manager!The Yurt as it currently looks.
STRETCH GOALS
$341,000 PLAY STRETCH
After the basics for opening up, our next goal is all the
toys! After all, this is one thing that REALLY separates us from other resorts!
This will include finishing the rec center, building the natural pool, kayaks,
water trampoline, other water toys, land trampoline, volleyball net, soccer
(don’t call it that here!) goals, Frisbee golf set, treehouses, art supplies,
video games and other media toys, music (recorded and instruments), basketball
court, loads of books, table tennis table, air hockey table, billiards table,
and dart board. And of course paying to ship all that here will also not be
free.  
We will be introducing some new toy perks for this stretch!!
I’ll let you wait for the details, but we will have stickers, the most amazing
book on play ever written, and a fabulous playshop!

$456,000 OFF THE GRID STRETCH
This will go to the purchase of our solar/wind system,
rainwater catchment system, composting toilets, and gray water system. Our
ecological commitment is another thing that really sets us apart!
There will be some REALLY COOL new perks for this stretch.
Those of you wanting to experience this beautiful place and also learn more
about Permaculture and living off the grid will want to pay attention to these
perks! There will also be some super fly, eco-friendly toys and deliciousness.
$606,000 LUXURY CABANA STRETCH
When we get to $606,000, we will be able to build the luxury
cabana. There is currently a Yurt for you to stay in when you come visit, but
it’s kinda small, kinda old, and definitely not luxurious. Using natural
building materials and employing the labor of our children and friends will
allow us to keep this expense lower ;) It is at this point, though, that we will
need to begin hiring permanent staff. 
Lowering our building costs means more lovely amenities for
your beautiful cabana! Have you ever seen a sauna/steam shower? Check it out:

Then, the hanging bed:

WHAT?! I know, right? You definitely want to stay here. And,
yes, we’re putting an organic mattress on that bad boy. Now, close your eyes
and feel the breeze, smell the salt, hear the waves! Paradise FOUND!
The stretches here will, of course, be luxury related. You
will want the yumminess perk for this goal for sure!!
$701,000 THE NEVERLAND FAMILY GETS A HOUSE!
There is another yurt on the land that we can live in for
now, but it is one circular room … and there are six of us. And again, it’s
kinda old. SO, we would love to have a little permanent structure that would
give each of our kids their own room and an office for the Neverland Beach
business. Again, we will be using natural building materials and the labor of
our families, friends, and students, so we can keep costs low. 
There will be fun and silly, more personal perks added for
this stretch. 
Here’s the overall budget broken down in a completely
different way just to confuse you and also allow us to have fun with pie charts
on Excel. 


IMPACT
I almost don’t have words for the impact this will have on
my family and me. This has been my dream for quite a long time, and I am so
deeply grateful for the support of our community in bringing this dream into
form. I believe we are going to do really great work at Neverland Beach and
that it is going to be a place that brings many people profound joy and
healing. 
For the country of Belize, I believe another prosperous,
truly sustainable resort has a tremendous impact in proving that ecotourism
brings in more dollars that stay here in Belize than putting up big hotels and
condos. And those dollars have a huge impact on the people of the local
communities where, not only will you spend your dollars, but also where we will
spend ours. Monkey River Town was once a much larger, thriving town, and we are
very excited to be a part of its big comeback with opportunities to
make good money, not only fishing, but also doing tours, hosting additional
guests, feeding people, and selling beautiful crafts. We are also in the
process of working out a profit sharing deal with the village. This is in
addition to the profit sharing with our employees. Neverland Beach can make a
big impact on Monkey River Town, and Monkey River Town has made a tremendous impact on us.
At the same time, there is very little impact on this
ecosystem. Here you have reef, beach, river, mangroves, and islands, all in
very close proximity. These are delicate ecosystems, so we are taking great
care to ensure this land is just as beautiful for generations to come. 
For those who come to visit, we believe the impact will be
tremendous. The culture, the land, the water, the animals, the people – it’s
all beautiful here. Belize was ranked by National Geographic Traveller as one
of the top ten happiest countries in the world. The weather is beautiful. It’s
always warm. There’s almost always a breeze. The things you will see here will
absolutely blow the top off your imagination. Just the sheer variety of what
you can experience is far more than you could ever do in a week or two. You
could also very contentedly spend the whole two weeks in a hammock drinking
coconut water - with or without rum. On top of that, there is so much opportunity for play and
adventure with family and friends. We firmly believe many relationships will be
healed here as people play together, surrounded by joy.  
CHALLENGES/RISKS 
So, this is the rainforest, which means it rains a good bit.
Even during the rainy season, it is often sunny for most of the day. However,
the amount of rain can vary and can lengthen construction time. 
There are also hurricanes, and though it is very uncommon
for a hurricane to hit full force in the southern part of Belize, it is always
possible. That would certainly be a setback. 
Bureaucracy can be somewhat hairy here at times. It is not
insurmountable, but it does require patience, persistence, knowledge, and
money. 
Anyone who knows me will tell you that I am doggedly
persistent. I am beyond committed to this project and will go to the ends of
the earth to see it through. We have sold almost everything we own to make our
life here, so we will do what needs to be done to make it work. 
WHAT YOU GET, AKA PERKS
Here are more detailed descriptions and pictures of our initial perks! Please note that more perks will
be released as we hit new stretch goals, so check back often!
$10 TEMPORARY TATTOOS! Let the world know you’re hooked on
PLAY with superfly tattoos! Is there a better way to showcase your vibrant
pirate love?! Take a shot of rum and grab a washcloth – you’re about to get way
cooler! Options are pirates (duh), lizards, dolphins, mermaids, jungle cats,
fairies, and sharks. 
$20 FAIRY DUST! Say it with me, “I do believe in fairies!!”
For 20 little dollars we will send you a little bottle of fairy dust to help
you remember that you, indeed, know how to fly, that you are, indeed, a magical
and miraculous being, and that all your dreams can come true, whether you want
to grow up or forever be a child!
$50 HANDMADE JEWELRY! Our lovely and talented daughter
Sophie makes gorgeous jewelry. She will make a piece just for you. These also
make really lovely gifts. It will be handmade clay pieces and/or beads. Colors
and lengths will vary. We promise you will LOVE! Please send a message indicating if you would like a necklace or earrings. There is a limit of 20 on these.
$100 ADD A CHILD! No, we are not giving away children. This is the $100 add-on for children to be
used in conjunction with the work trade stays and permaculture and natural
building courses. 
$150 ONE-HOUR COACHING SESSION WITH THE PLAY DOCTOR! Get an
hour with world-renowned play doctor Natalie Kinsey and learn how to play your
way to lasting joy!
$200 ONE WEEK STAY WITH WORK TRADE! What?! Seriously?!
Yes!!! Come spend a week with us in the current state of the resort for just a
tiny bit of money. You’ll also do 20 hours of work trade on the land and/or
structures. No special skills required. We’re certain we can find something you
can do! This cost is per adult. Children are $100 and are of course not
required to work. Please do separate contributions for each adult and the $100
add-on for each child. The lodgings will vary depending on when you come and
where we are in the process. You will most likely be staying in the yurt but
may or may not have fancy things. We’ll let you know when you schedule so you
know what to bring. Breakfast will be provided. You are welcome to buy food and
use the kitchen for lunch or have lunch with any number of amazing cooks in
Monkey River Town for $5 or $6. Dinner at the resort is $10 per adult. Kids eat
free. Again, you’re always welcome to head over to the village to eat as well. A
minimum of two people in the yurt per week, so buddy up with someone you like,
or take a chance on meeting someone new! Email us to schedule your stay.Something that needs some work!

$750 ONE WEEK PERMACULTURE WORKSHOP! Come do a one week
permaculture workshop with certified Permaculture Designer, Karen Barrett.
Karen has studied permaculture and natural building for many years and is now
in the process of becoming a certified journeyman. This is the one week “book
learning” portion. All meals and materials will be provided. You are welcome to
bring a tent or just bring a camping mat and share the floor of the yurt with
your fellow students! Please note that, though Karen has completed both
Permaculture 1 and Permaculture 2, she is not certified to give you a
Permaculture Designer Certificate. Same knowledge, but without the paper.  Please add $100 per child if you need
childcare for the week using the $100 ADD A CHILD! perk above. 



$850 ONE WEEK NATURAL BUILDING WORKSHOP! Come learn natural
building techniques with Karen and a host of other local builders who’ve been
doing natural building the way their ancestors did for thousands of years
before them! This is a really awesome opportunity to learn to work with a
number of different materials and learn to create a structure that can
withstand a number of challenges (rain, humidity, sand, salt, hurricanes, and
intense heat). You’ll also get the opportunity to see some of the local natural
buildings. AND you get to help build one of our structures!!!!!
As with the Permaculture Workshop, all meals and materials
are provided. Lodging is camping (byot!) or on the floor of the yurt with your
fellow workshoppers. Please use the $100 ADD A CHILD! perk for each child if
you will need childcare for the week. 

Wouldn't this be fun to build?!
$1200 ONE WEEK FOR FOUR IN THE YURT WITH THREE ADVENTURES!
Don’t feel like doing work trade on your vacation? We get that! Come stay in
the yurt while work is being done at the resort and get a tremendous discount!
Furnishings and amenities will vary depending on when you come. This means you
may or may not have fancy stuff. Once it gets close to time for you to come, we
will let you know what the furnishings situation is so you can plan
appropriately. If you are more than 4 in your clan (we get that too!), just do
the $100 add-on for each additional child. Breakfast will be provided. You are
welcome to buy food and use the kitchen for lunch or eat over in the village
with any number of amazing cooks for $5 or $6. Dinner at the resort is $10 per
adult. Kids eat free. Again, you’re always welcome to head over to the village
or into neighboring towns to eat as well. 
This perk also includes 3 adventures! Adventures available
will, again, vary depending on what stage of evolution we are in. Possibilities
include: Boat Trips up the Monkey River with local guides, Jungle Hikes with
local guides, Chocolate Tours (!) of a Mayan owned cacao farm and chocolate
making facility, Snorkeling at nearby cayes, Cave Adventures with local guides,
Birding with local guides, Tours of Mayan Ruins with local Mayan guides,
Fishing with local fishermen, and Drum Lessons with local master drummer,

will provide a minister (or perhaps a scurvy dog boat captain), a bouquet,
decorations, chairs, food, and alcohol for you, your spouse-to-be and 10
guests. Please know we are not set up at this time to house that many people,
so your guests will need to stay either in Monkey River Town or Placencia.

wedding. AND you get one week in the Luxury Cabana with five adventures. See
above perks for more info about our cabana, adventures, meal plan, and onsite

We have hosted and helped troubled teens who come to Hawaii searching for inner peace. We have hosted people from large Jewish communities who thanked us for connecting them with their roots in ways they never can back at home!

<li>Another challenge is that while our community is GREAT in quality (ie the Big Island attracts large souls) we are SMALL in quantity.

the world with food, this is our mission.


Thousands of farmers in the Philippines work for months but are unable to find people willing to purchase their produce. These factors often leave farmers with very little earnings to live a life with dignity. Many rural farmers are often subject to the country's fickle weather, transportation challenges, and middlemen taking advantage of their need to earn from their harvests.

We've heard stories of farmers getting as little as 3,000 PHP or around 70 USD for farm labor worth three months! Because of these challenges, it is not uncommon hearing accounts of Filipino farmers abandoning their lands to look for other ways of earning a living.


Good Food Community is a Community Shared Agriculture (CSA) program founded in the Philippines in 2011.  We exist to ensure that farmers get their fair share so they can live a comfortable life and to promote sustainable methods of farming to feed communities and to help the environment. (Photo credit: Yummy Magazine)
We are about growing a society that nourishes everyone—you, the farmers, the land and
generations to come. The multiple crises of our age serve as an invitation to
evolve a new system and culture—one that puts the planet and people first. We
believe this is possible through Community Shared Agriculture.
What is CSA?





Community Shared Agriculture is a sustainable
alternative distribution system that supports smallholder organic farming by
subscribing to prepaid, local and seasonal vegetables delivered weekly to your
community.  (Photo credit: Yummy Magazine)
The CSA business model provides farmers with a stable demand and guarantees subscribers with a share
of the harvest every week. 
CSA also enables farmers to plan ahead and grow what is needed for a specific number of subscribers who have put their trust in the farmers by paying for the produce upfront.  


 (Photo credit: Yummy Magazine)


We coordinate a network of over sixty (60) smallholder partner farmers from the provinces of Benguet, Mt. Province, and Tarlac to provide fresh produce weekly to our subscribers. As of this campaign, we are supplying over ninety (90) subscribers in Metro Manila. 

The Project



Taking care of our partner farmers is of utmost importance to us. We want to help them form meaningful relationships with the people they feed and be agents of change and beacons of hope in their respective communities.
Our goal is to restore dignity to the profession of farming and empower farmers to innovate, be creative, and excel in their craft.

Be part of our advocacy by pledging support to
our farmers’ Learning & Accreditation (L&A) Program. 
The L&A Program will provide Good Food Community partner farmers with the necessary tools, life skills, and practical knowledge to sustain their own farms; manage their own agribusinesses; and positively influence their communities by living a sustainable lifestyle and being an agent of change. 
 The program includes the following activities:
·  Farmer

- provision of useful farm equipment and tools (i.e. water drums, pH meters, digital weighing scales, etc.)
- workshops and seminars on seed saving, germination techniques, soil health,  natural pest control, and permaculture design
- educational trips to organic farms and demo sites

We are also in need of the following items to help us preserve the quality of our produce and improve our logistics and delivery system:
1) A chest freezer
2) A refrigerator
3) An air conditioner for our vegetable storage space and packing area
4) A salad spinner for drying leafy vegetables

With your kind
donations we can equip more farmers to practice organic farming and advocate
Community Shared Agriculture in the Philippines.

<p>There are inherent risks to opening any
place of business. That’s why we have strategically gained momentum in other
areas, including wholesale business and event catering. We are now confident in
our abilities and are ready to take on a new challenge. Opening a brick-and-mortar space will allow us to create direct relationships with our
supporters. It will give us a chance to create a dialogue on a more personal
level to effectively cater a menu that provides exactly what our customers want.
It will also give us the ability to take on additional events. With increased
kitchen space and a permanent venue, we can host private events, workshops,
tastings and classes, ultimately bringing people together to strengthen the
sense of community in Los Angeles over an incredible meal. We will always strive
to create a lasting impression that goes beyond a meal, celebrating creativity,
community and good company.</p>

</div></div>","A unique concept bringing elevated food to a take-away café
and event space.SOO N developed from small beginnings. What started as an earnest desire to share good food has developed into a food concept encompassing catering, jam/pantry retail, and event services.  With a background in fashion and fine arts, Saehee Cho endeavors to create food that engages with her artistic practice, sustainable food efforts, and seasonal flavors.  SOO N is interested in the entire scope and process of food making---from engaging with local farmers to meticulous menu planning; SOO N understands food as more than The Plate.With the support of friends and believers in meaningful food, SOO N is looking to open a multi-function kitchen space : a take-away café by day and event space by night.  We want to host workshops and lectures.  We want to host cooking classes and make a creative space centered around food.  Most of all, we want to feed you.  Think : Convenient market fresh lunches, the perfect warm pastry with your morning coffee, a quick dessert between errands . Think : Finger sandwiches with soft cheeses and stone fruit, big family style bowls of herb-y rice salad, the most seasonal fruit served with honeycomb and lavender yogurt.Along with private funds, we will strategically allocate the $30,000 towards signing a lease on a commercial kitchen and event space in Los Angeles, furnishing the venue and creating a community space that seeks to not only feed but nourish.  










SOO N is a specialty food concept that hosts pop-up dinners, sells pantry products and caters special events. We need your help to open a brick-and-mortar take-away restaurant and event space in the heart of Los Angeles.
Our food has an emphasis on seasonal market ingredients--hand-picked, slow-cooked, and presented with the utmost care to create a meal that is both beautiful and delicious.
Each dish tells a story and every ingredient is chosen with care and precision from farmers and vendors that contribute to a sense of community that SOO N regards as a fundamental principle.







We are asking a lot from you, so we want to give back and
say thank you by offering some amazing perks!
For $15  you can receive a digital copy of a Hand Drawn Recipe from our Kitchen


For $25 you will receive a printed Hand Drawn Recipe from our Kitchen





















































































There are inherent risks to opening any
place of business. That’s why we have strategically gained momentum in other
areas, including wholesale business and event catering. We are now confident in
our abilities and are ready to take on a new challenge. Opening a brick-and-mortar space will allow us to create direct relationships with our
supporters. It will give us a chance to create a dialogue on a more personal
level to effectively cater a menu that provides exactly what our customers want.
It will also give us the ability to take on additional events. With increased
kitchen space and a permanent venue, we can host private events, workshops,
tastings and classes, ultimately bringing people together to strengthen the
sense of community in Los Angeles over an incredible meal. We will always strive
to create a lasting impression that goes beyond a meal, celebrating creativity,
community and good company.







SOO N has a big dream. With this money, you will have a hand
in creating a space that you can visit and enjoy yourself. Along with private funding, this $30,000 will be contributing to:
· 
Signing a lease on a commercial kitchen and event space
in Los Angeles.
· 
Purchasing industrial kitchen tools and appliances.
· 
Creating a space that embodies the SOO N
atmosphere, but has the ability to change with each event held at our venue. 
· 
Investing in tables, chairs, cutlery and linens. 
· 
Continuing to purchase high-quality ingredients
from our local famers and market vendors, to provide our ever-changing,
seasonal menus.
·  Providing a place for creative workshops, food & wine tastings and fantastic cooking classes.

AIDS Day’ when I suddenly realized I needed to find some of the most impoverished
people in the world, leave my privileged life as a successful artist for a
couple years, and go to Africa to do whatever I could to serve fellow human beings
in their time of need. My intention was and still is to fearlessly thank the
universe for always giving me what I truly need, and to have more of the
wonders life has to offer, as I truly believe the more one gives - the more one
gets!</p>
<p><b>I</b> enrolled into a program with a nonprofit organization that
trained me as a volunteer to use teaching, doing, and being the living example as
a way of promoting positive changes that can be achieved by taking action. As
volunteers we live together in the same community as the people who we together
come up with solutions for the different situations one experiences living in poverty.
We fill positions in schools, orphanages, or development projects with NGOs,
and we share our experiences and build friendships with those who we help
realize their worth. I took a position in a Teacher’s Training College in
Mozambique for a year to provide me with practice to all I had come to learn
and understand about poverty in a developing country during my training.
Mozambique being one of the poorest countries (# 15 up from the poorest) is
struggling to train much needed primary school teachers, builders, and farmers
to help push the country into a more progressive future and get their foot onto
the first rail of the economic ladder of growth. </p>
<p><b>I</b>t really is true that to teach one how to fish rather than
to just give him a fish is a more sustainable way to empower people so that they
have tools to lift themselves up out of poverty by their own efforts and
improve their situation, but the ugly reality of extreme poverty is more
complicated. People who are living without one or more of the basics we all
need for a dignified life like; food, water, clothes, shelter, health and
sanitation service, medical facilities, or access to education, have a very
difficult time thinking and planning for the future when they are striving to
get through another day constantly vulnerable to the next crisis. </p>
<p><b>M</b>y year in Mozambique was life changing for me, and my couple
of years commitment to do what I can for others less fortunate than myself turned
into a decade - now more determined and committed than ever. When I returned to
the USA after my practice year at the Teacher’s Training College I started
working for the non-profit organization that ran the program I had completed,
and I started training the new volunteers. My students went to Mozambique,
Belize, Malawi, and Zambia where they worked and contributed in the communities
where they lived. It was a fulltime occupation running a boarding school/
training center and it was also very fulfilling, and a good place for me to
continue to study, investigate, and prepare myself for what I am doing now.</p>
<p><b>L</b>ast year it became time for me to move back to Mozambique
and commit myself in a much bigger way in the struggle that so many people have
every day of their lives, and to use everything I’ve learned to contribute and initiate
more positive changes. During a trip to Mozambique in 2012 I visited several
schools and projects to meet with the leaders and make plans for my student’s
practice periods, and I also had the opportunity to visit a friend who was
working on a banana farm. The farm ‘Jacaranda’ was started up by a group of
humanitarians who believe that by organizing and working together it is
possible to create a better world by addressing injustices such as extreme
poverty. The farm is located in the remote bush of northern Mozambique and the
majority of workers who constitute the Jacaranda community and leadership have
previous experiences in developmental projects such as AIDS education for
prevention and teaching, while some of the workers are fresh from getting a
degree in agriculture. The work they were doing and the way they were living
really touched something in me and the idea of joining them would not leave me,
so here I have completed 11 months of my 5 year agreement. </p>
<p><b>W</b>e are 32 people living on the farm and in addition we are
hosting students from agriculture schools in groups of 5 to 10. We are located between
the village of Napito and the Lurio River and we employ about 50 people full
and part time from the surrounding communities. Being part of a socially
conscious collective farm is very powerful in a country that can lack so much
hope for so many people, and it is a great model and example of a very
effective way for people to work together and improve their quality of life. I am
the only person living on the farm who is not from Mozambique, and I am
extremely grateful for having this opportunity. There is so much that I can do
here in the nearby community of Napito with your help, and the support from the
people who live here. </p>
<p><b>T</b>he money I am raising is to be used for upgrading the
education and improve access to health service in Napito, and host activities in the community center over the next 4 years.</p>
<p><b>·<span> 
</span></b>Build a new primary school that will serve as a
community center - There are two government teachers in Napito but the school
and resources are in great need.</p>
<p><b>·</b><b> </b>

community for emergency and scheduled trips to the hospital, and to bring
locally produced goods and crafts to markets.

In addition, we offer a Southern solution to meet a San Franciscan need: a meal that stands out among a crowded field of creative cuisine because it’s prepared thoughtfully, specifically for you, with the intention of inspiring social connection.</p><br/><p>Marigny Social Club was founded in 2015 by Chef Caleb Cook, who moved to San Francisco in 2013. Caleb has been cooking professionally for 20 years. He trained under Chef Susan Spicer in New Orleans before opening St. Lawrence, in the French Quarter, in 2012. He loves working in San Francisco because of the city’s appreciation for unique food experiences. In a city where it’s so easy to enjoy a fantastic meal, Caleb noticed an opportunity: to provide innovative and accessible experiences that go beyond just exceptional food and presentation to connect diners to each other in a memorable way.  </p><br/><p>Caleb’s vision to found Marigny Social Club has attracted other hospitality professionals in the Bay Area and beyond, whose combined expertise and personalities have made Marigny Social Club events so successful. Almost everyone who attends one of our events comes back again, and it’s those people who make Marigny Social Club special. Guests sit at a communal table, eat together, and enjoy conversation and ambiance that complements the food and theme.</p><br/><h2>What We Need</h2><br/><br/><p>If successful, this campaign will fund our expansion to meet the already high demand for imaginative, supper club style events in San Francisco, including a year’s rental of a commercial kitchen, caterer permits, insurance, and other infrastructure costs. This campaign and its rewards include a presale for our forthcoming events calendar.</p><br/><p>Our hope, and the primary goal of this campaign, is to pre-sell a percentage of seats for our 2016 events, and concentrate the season’s revenue in a way that allows us to make infrastructure improvements now.</p><br/><h2>What You Get </h2><br/><p>Supporters of Marigny Social Club get the first chance to take part in our events and projects for 2016. We hope you’ll give us a try! Sample some of our favorite flavors, in the form of either jam or pickles, or be a part of one (or more) of our theme dinners. For larger donations, we’ll bring the party to you and your friends with catering for large and small events. All our rewards make great gifts. Share and enjoy!</p><br/><h2>Impact </h2><br/><p>Marigny Social Club supports, and is supported by, a thriving community of diners. We’re lucky to be well-loved in the Bay Area and elsewhere, and we’re excited to spread the word and grow further.

In addition, we offer a Southern solution to meet a San Franciscan need: a meal that stands out among a crowded field of creative cuisine because it’s prepared thoughtfully, specifically for you, with the intention of inspiring social connection.Marigny Social Club was founded in 2015 by Chef Caleb Cook, who moved to San Francisco in 2013. Caleb has been cooking professionally for 20 years. He trained under Chef Susan Spicer in New Orleans before opening St. Lawrence, in the French Quarter, in 2012. He loves working in San Francisco because of the city’s appreciation for unique food experiences. In a city where it’s so easy to enjoy a fantastic meal, Caleb noticed an opportunity: to provide innovative and accessible experiences that go beyond just exceptional food and presentation to connect diners to each other in a memorable way.  Caleb’s vision to found Marigny Social Club has attracted other hospitality professionals in the Bay Area and beyond, whose combined expertise and personalities have made Marigny Social Club events so successful. Almost everyone who attends one of our events comes back again, and it’s those people who make Marigny Social Club special. Guests sit at a communal table, eat together, and enjoy conversation and ambiance that complements the food and theme.What We NeedIf successful, this campaign will fund our expansion to meet the already high demand for imaginative, supper club style events in San Francisco, including a year’s rental of a commercial kitchen, caterer permits, insurance, and other infrastructure costs. This campaign and its rewards include a presale for our forthcoming events calendar.Our hope, and the primary goal of this campaign, is to pre-sell a percentage of seats for our 2016 events, and concentrate the season’s revenue in a way that allows us to make infrastructure improvements now.What You Get Supporters of Marigny Social Club get the first chance to take part in our events and projects for 2016. We hope you’ll give us a try! Sample some of our favorite flavors, in the form of either jam or pickles, or be a part of one (or more) of our theme dinners. For larger donations, we’ll bring the party to you and your friends with catering for large and small events. All our rewards make great gifts. Share and enjoy!Impact Marigny Social Club supports, and is supported by, a thriving community of diners. We’re lucky to be well-loved in the Bay Area and elsewhere, and we’re excited to spread the word and grow further.

Todo ello según las últimas investigaciones científicas más rigurosas e independientes. And the last one, the Impact on Health. To rate the products this way we have the expertise and rigour of the Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona and Universitat Rovira i Virgili. We use our own laboratories to evaluate the products with complete independence. This laboratories are in Vilanova i la Geltru (Barcelona) and are run by our commercial partner Inkemia. To evaluate this products we take in consideration nutritional factors, chemical risks (migrants, contaminants, compounds), and allergens. This aspects will be rated by their dangerousness and their potential consequences on the health of those who consume them.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

We deeply believe that food cultivated and prepared with love and respect for the environment, people and animals; not only tastes amazing, but carries a high vitality- kind of “love vibration” to it. So if the saying: “you are what you eat”, is right (it really is), then by eating this food, you truly are being fueled by LOVE! It’s all about reciprocity - we give love to the Earth and the Earth gives love back to us! When we are fueled by love, we have the capacity to live radiant, fulfilling lives and inspire others to do the same. It’s a love-feedback-loop of awesomeness that can change the world.</em></p>

</div></div>","What We're All About We have always been surrounded by small businesses and entrepreneurs. They are our parents, friends, aunts and uncles. We learn from them every day, from how they pour their passion into their businesses, and from their hard work and energy. They support our communities. Now we want to help support them!
We are MíByz, a home-grown startup in Hamilton, Ontario. When we talk to small business owners and managers (often our friends and family), we hear about common challenges they all face. Almost every time we think, ""We can help with that."" And now we're going to by offering fun, effective, and affordable elearning solutions for those same owners and managers, as well as their employees!
We have already started our website. Most of it is waiting for our launch date (we want to start releasing beta courses this summer), but you can still check it out!   What We Need & What You Get We don't want to make just any courses. We want to make interactive and engaging elearning tools that go beyond theory, and help learners apply concepts to their own businesses. To do this, we need to purchase Articulate Storyline 2, which is special software for elearning development that will help us create real solutions for real people! Most of the funds we get here will help realize that goal. The rest of it will help kickstart our online marketing communications so that the world knows that we are here to help.
    The Impact Our management courses will focus on topics such as:  Retail space optimization
Selecting a product mix
Finding and hiring good employees
Developing a business strategy
Writing an orientation and training manual
Strategic pricing and promotions 
We also want to make mini-modules for small business employees. These could include:


How to engage a customer
Customer accessibility
Professional acumen
Closing a sale

And more!

In that brief time, website design has progressed more than it has in the past ten years. We believe that a vast number of websites would benefit substantially from an upgrade to a modern standard that better suits their brands and identities.</p>
<p>To that end we are rebranding and relaunching our company as EdgeFox, a provider of web hosting and website creation services. We aim to create high-impact and high-caliber websites while maintaining affordability for our clients. Our team believes that your brand deserves a website that will match your brand's quality. We specialize in upgrading obsolete websites into modern ones, and for those who do not already have a website, we offer full service website creation and hosting that will be up to the modern standard.</p>
<p>We offer a better solution for businesses and individuals than other web hosts since our relationship doesn't end when you buy hosting. We follow through with our clients and offer to assist you by creating your websites for you without the unneeded stress of having to do it yourself. At EdgeFox, our relationship doesn't end when you buy a hosting package.</p>
<p>For our launch, <b>we are raising money to pay for new web designs, new software, and a new server provider</b>.</p>

<p>Te invito a conocerme...</p>
<p>Nací en <b>Florida</b>, Uruguay el 9 de
  diciembre de 1984. Seis meses después, el 1ero de mayo de 1985 cambiaría mi
  vida para siempre: la habitación donde dormía mientras mi familia cenaba con
  amigos se incendió. <br/>
<br/>
  Al ser un día de tormenta, no había electricidad en la casa en ese momento,
  por lo que mi madre dejó una vela encendida cerca de mi cuna, sin pensar en
  lo que sucedería después. La vela cayó al suelo prendiendo fuego a todo lo
  que había alrededor incluyendo mi cuna. Cuando oyeron mi llanto, ya estaba en
  llamas. Rápidamente me llevaron mis padres a Urgencias en el Hospital Militar
  de Montevideo para salvar mi vida. Estuve 32 días en coma y no había esperanza
  de vida alguna. La quemadura era de primer grado pero abarcaba todo el lado
  izquierdo de mi cuerpo y cabeza, tanto así que perdí la mano izquierda. Días
  después de despertar del coma, pasé a “la burbuja” donde viví un año y medio
  y posteriormente en la Unidad de Quemados del mismo hospital hasta mis 5
  años, ya que estaba en un coma inducido, que es un tratamiento para quemados. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">              </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1283442/files/20150310063034-8462727_orig.jpeg?1425994234"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 561.461728395062px; height: 374px; background-color: initial;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">          </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>A partir de esta edad comencé a hacer lo que se puede llamar vida
  normal, es decir, empecé mis estudios en la Escuela Rural número 105, Costas
  de Arias, en Florida, cerca de mi casa. Mi vida se dividía entre hospitales,
  mi casa y la escuela. Crecí así, entre tratamientos, cirujanos, psicólogos,
  fisioterapeutas, hospitales… <b>Mi única motivación para salir adelante eran los
  caballos. </b>Tanto así que si los médicos o las enfermeras que no me hablaban de
  caballos no me dejaba hacer nada. Siempre decía a mi cirujano, el Doctor
  Arcos, que de grande sería una gran amazona y que representaría a mi país, a
  lo que él respondía con compadecencia.<br/>
<br/>
  Terminé mis estudios de Secundaria en la misma escuela y para cursar
  Bachillerato me trasladé a Florida. Fue allí donde empezaron los problemas:
  me sentía observada, juzgada, sentía rabia por la gente que se quejaba por
  tonterías y empecé a valorar lo que es la vida, el dolor y la enseñanza que
  puedes transmitir con tu incapacidad. Empecé a ser consciente de todo por lo
  que había pasado en mi vida y a valorarla, a <b>quererme,</b> a <b>aceptarme</b> a mí misma
  y a mi discapacidad, a entender que era algo que no tenía solución y que me
  acompañaría toda la vida. <b>Descubrí que puedes ayudar a mucha gente siendo un
  ejemplo de superación personal así que dedicaba mi tiempo libre a la lucha de
  mis propios sueños, retándome a mí misma y demostrando que todo se puede si
  hay voluntad.</b></p>

<p>Me gradué de Bachillerato en la Escuela de Avicultura de Florida con
  el título de Técnico Agropecuario. Después empecé la carrera de Veterinaria
  en la Universidad de la República de Uruguay pero no era lo que yo esperaba
  así que comencé a estudiar Gastronomía y paralelamente hacía un curso en la
  Escuela de Equitación del Ejército Uruguayo para ser instructora de
  Equinoterapia. Cada vez me daba cuenta que lo que yo quería de verdad era
  montar a caballo para cumplir mis metas, contrariamente a lo que todos los de
  mi alrededor me decían. Nunca creyeron que fuese capaz de llegar donde quería
  llegar: ser una amazona paralímpica internacional y representar a mi país.
  Así que decidí dejarlo todo y tomar un avión a Europa, a cumplir mis sueños.<br/>
             <br/>
  Al principio me costó encontrar trabajo, ya que no me creían capaz de
  sobrellevar todas las tareas (que eran casi puramente físicas). Poco a poco
  me fui ganando la <b>confianza y el cariño </b>de la gente en Cataluña. Trabajé en
  la Hípica Raúl Llorens Vila en Olot, en el club privado Mas Caterina en
  Madremaña, con Claire van Gelder en Equipassió cerca de San Feliu de Guixols
  y posteriormente en la Yeguada del Lago en Caldes de Malavella durante 5
  años. Es allí donde conocí a Fandango, mi campeón.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>Empecé a entrenar con Fandango para los Juegos Olímpicos Londres 2012.
  Mi sueño estaba a punto de cumplirse con la ayuda de mis entrenadores Álvaro
  Almiñana Poquet y Linda Swande, y varios sponsors tanto uruguayos como
  europeos. Pero llegar a los Juegos Olímpicos no fue tan fácil, el nivel era
  altísimo y mi entrenamiento comenzó tarde aunque la falta de recursos
  económicos era el factor principal. Hicimos todo lo posible y más y aún así
  nos quedamos a dos puntos de clasificar para el Ranking.<br/>
<br/>
  Actualmente, gracias a  mi  <b>perseverancia</b>  por alcanzar mis
  metas, me he ganado el cariño de la gente de mi país y de muchos otros, no
  sólo como deportista, sino también como mujer emprendedora. He aparecido en
  varios medios de comunicación (radio, televisión, revistas, periódicos, notas
  informativas, noticias internacionales, etc.) y también en trabajos de imagen
  alguna vez, con los cuales quiero transmitir un mensaje: que la perfección no
  existe y que <b>la belleza natural de una mujer se basa en su esencia y es
  eterna</b>. Ahora estoy trabajando en diferentes proyectos  y participo en
  campañas mostrando otra imagen de la belleza femenina. Estoy dando charlas
  honorariamente en todo el país tratando de que mi ejemplo sirva a otros, esto
  es sumamente gratificante.

having dinner with some friends, caught fire. It was a stormy day and there was
no electricity in the house, so my mum left a candle in my bedroom near my cot,
 without ever imagine what may happened next. The candle fell on to the
floor and burned everything around me, including my cot. When they heard my
crying, I was already burned. My parents took me as fast as possible to the
emergency at the Army Hospital of Montevideo in order to save my life.</p>

was no hope at all. The burnings were of first grade and they spanned through
my body's left side including my head. They were so severe, that I lost my left
hand.</p>
<p>A few days after waking up from the coma, I
went into what I call the “bubble”, where I lived a year and a half; after this
I was moved to the Burned Unit in the same hospital until I was five years old.
For all these time I was in an induced coma for almost 5 years, receiving
special treatment. From that moment on, I started doing what I we can call a
normal life, that means beginning my studies at the Rural School number 105
“Costas de Arias”, which is located in Florida, nearby my house.</p>

Mi nombre es Alfonsina
Maldonado, soy atleta paralímpica en la disciplina de adiestramiento ecuestre. Estoy convencida que todos los sueños son
alcanzables por muchas barreras
que haya en el camino. Hoy entreno para
llegar a Río 2016.
Te invito a conocerme...
Nací en Florida, Uruguay el 9 de
  diciembre de 1984. Seis meses después, el 1ero de mayo de 1985 cambiaría mi
  vida para siempre: la habitación donde dormía mientras mi familia cenaba con
  amigos se incendió. 

  Al ser un día de tormenta, no había electricidad en la casa en ese momento,
  por lo que mi madre dejó una vela encendida cerca de mi cuna, sin pensar en
  lo que sucedería después. La vela cayó al suelo prendiendo fuego a todo lo
  que había alrededor incluyendo mi cuna. Cuando oyeron mi llanto, ya estaba en
  llamas. Rápidamente me llevaron mis padres a Urgencias en el Hospital Militar
  de Montevideo para salvar mi vida. Estuve 32 días en coma y no había esperanza
  de vida alguna. La quemadura era de primer grado pero abarcaba todo el lado
  izquierdo de mi cuerpo y cabeza, tanto así que perdí la mano izquierda. Días
  después de despertar del coma, pasé a “la burbuja” donde viví un año y medio
  y posteriormente en la Unidad de Quemados del mismo hospital hasta mis 5
  años, ya que estaba en un coma inducido, que es un tratamiento para quemados.                         

A partir de esta edad comencé a hacer lo que se puede llamar vida
  normal, es decir, empecé mis estudios en la Escuela Rural número 105, Costas
  de Arias, en Florida, cerca de mi casa. Mi vida se dividía entre hospitales,
  mi casa y la escuela. Crecí así, entre tratamientos, cirujanos, psicólogos,
  fisioterapeutas, hospitales… Mi única motivación para salir adelante eran los
  caballos. Tanto así que si los médicos o las enfermeras que no me hablaban de
  caballos no me dejaba hacer nada. Siempre decía a mi cirujano, el Doctor
  Arcos, que de grande sería una gran amazona y que representaría a mi país, a
  lo que él respondía con compadecencia.

  Terminé mis estudios de Secundaria en la misma escuela y para cursar
  Bachillerato me trasladé a Florida. Fue allí donde empezaron los problemas:
  me sentía observada, juzgada, sentía rabia por la gente que se quejaba por
  tonterías y empecé a valorar lo que es la vida, el dolor y la enseñanza que
  puedes transmitir con tu incapacidad. Empecé a ser consciente de todo por lo
  que había pasado en mi vida y a valorarla, a quererme, a aceptarme a mí misma
  y a mi discapacidad, a entender que era algo que no tenía solución y que me
  acompañaría toda la vida. Descubrí que puedes ayudar a mucha gente siendo un
  ejemplo de superación personal así que dedicaba mi tiempo libre a la lucha de
  mis propios sueños, retándome a mí misma y demostrando que todo se puede si
  hay voluntad.












Me gradué de Bachillerato en la Escuela de Avicultura de Florida con
  el título de Técnico Agropecuario. Después empecé la carrera de Veterinaria
  en la Universidad de la República de Uruguay pero no era lo que yo esperaba
  así que comencé a estudiar Gastronomía y paralelamente hacía un curso en la
  Escuela de Equitación del Ejército Uruguayo para ser instructora de
  Equinoterapia. Cada vez me daba cuenta que lo que yo quería de verdad era
  montar a caballo para cumplir mis metas, contrariamente a lo que todos los de
  mi alrededor me decían. Nunca creyeron que fuese capaz de llegar donde quería
  llegar: ser una amazona paralímpica internacional y representar a mi país.
  Así que decidí dejarlo todo y tomar un avión a Europa, a cumplir mis sueños.
             
  Al principio me costó encontrar trabajo, ya que no me creían capaz de
  sobrellevar todas las tareas (que eran casi puramente físicas). Poco a poco
  me fui ganando la confianza y el cariño de la gente en Cataluña. Trabajé en
  la Hípica Raúl Llorens Vila en Olot, en el club privado Mas Caterina en
  Madremaña, con Claire van Gelder en Equipassió cerca de San Feliu de Guixols
  y posteriormente en la Yeguada del Lago en Caldes de Malavella durante 5
  años. Es allí donde conocí a Fandango, mi campeón.



Empecé a entrenar con Fandango para los Juegos Olímpicos Londres 2012.
  Mi sueño estaba a punto de cumplirse con la ayuda de mis entrenadores Álvaro
  Almiñana Poquet y Linda Swande, y varios sponsors tanto uruguayos como
  europeos. Pero llegar a los Juegos Olímpicos no fue tan fácil, el nivel era
  altísimo y mi entrenamiento comenzó tarde aunque la falta de recursos
  económicos era el factor principal. Hicimos todo lo posible y más y aún así
  nos quedamos a dos puntos de clasificar para el Ranking.

  Actualmente, gracias a  mi  perseverancia  por alcanzar mis
  metas, me he ganado el cariño de la gente de mi país y de muchos otros, no
  sólo como deportista, sino también como mujer emprendedora. He aparecido en
  varios medios de comunicación (radio, televisión, revistas, periódicos, notas
  informativas, noticias internacionales, etc.) y también en trabajos de imagen
  alguna vez, con los cuales quiero transmitir un mensaje: que la perfección no
  existe y que la belleza natural de una mujer se basa en su esencia y es
  eterna. Ahora estoy trabajando en diferentes proyectos  y participo en
  campañas mostrando otra imagen de la belleza femenina. Estoy dando charlas
  honorariamente en todo el país tratando de que mi ejemplo sirva a otros, esto
  es sumamente gratificante.
  
 








Gracias a que no he dejado de prepararme  y cuento con uno de los
  mejores entrenadores del mundo, Francisco Cancella de Abreu.  Esta vez tengo mucha fe de
  clasificar para los Juegos Olímpicos Río de Janeiro 2016, ya que cuento con
  un equipo de personas llenas de luz. Quiero seguir luchando por mis sueños y
  seguir sirviendo de inspiración para los demás.



Competir a nivel olímpico en la modalidad Dressage exige una armonía completa entre amazona y caballo. Ocho meses atrás comencé mi trabajo con ZigZag, un caballo con el que compartíamos, con solo mirarnos, la conciencia de un propósito ganador. Debido a una inesperada lesión, ZigZag no podrá competir más.Quizás algunas personas piensen que este deporte es elitista, pero no lo es. La prueba de ello es mi propia experiencia de vida. El caballo es uno de los íconos de la Patria Gaucha y de muchísimas historias que atraviesan todos los estamentos sociales, sin exclusión.Ahora necesito un caballo nuevo, capaz de imbuirse en el objetivo de ser campeón olímpico y traer esta medalla para Uruguay y el resto de Latinoamérica. Este caballo llevará también el emblema del “sí se puede“, la visión de que la discapacidad es una oportunidad, que la belleza va de la mano de los valores y que, sin trabajar duro, no es posible lograr un medioambiente sustentable.Espero tu ayuda.I'm Alfonsina Maldonado and I’m a Paralympic Athlete for the equestrian dressage discipline. I’m absolutely convinced that every dream can be achieved no matter how many barriers there are on the path. Now I’m training for Rio 2016.I invite you to get to know me…I was born in
Florida, Uruguay, December 9th 1984. Six months later, May 1st 1985, my life
will hardly change forever. The room where I was sleeping while my family was
having dinner with some friends, caught fire. It was a stormy day and there was
no electricity in the house, so my mum left a candle in my bedroom near my cot,
 without ever imagine what may happened next. The candle fell on to the
floor and burned everything around me, including my cot. When they heard my
crying, I was already burned. My parents took me as fast as possible to the
emergency at the Army Hospital of Montevideo in order to save my life.
I have been thirty two days in coma and there
was no hope at all. The burnings were of first grade and they spanned through
my body's left side including my head. They were so severe, that I lost my left
hand.
A few days after waking up from the coma, I
went into what I call the “bubble”, where I lived a year and a half; after this
I was moved to the Burned Unit in the same hospital until I was five years old.

   What Reptilia Den needs and what you get from me

I am asking for $40,000 to cover start up costs. With your help I will be able to acquire the storefront, enclosures and equipment for the animals, shelving, rodent rack systems, and stock. I also need financing to handle setting up the space. That includes putting up or taking down walls, a public restroom, heating and cooling needs, electrical specifications, store fixtures (i.e. lighting, countertops, register). It's a very long list that just keeps going!

In return I am offering various levels of discounts, free presentations, and apparel. If you'd like something that you don't see listed, ask me! I'm absolutely more than happy to work with you in order to show my appreciation. If you'd like to donate more than what's outlined we can tailor perks just for you!
And what happens if I don't reach my goal? I will be pursuing other avenues but all funds raised here will go toward the opening of Reptilia Den regardless.

The impact
Reptiles get an unfair reputation here in the desert. With all of the misconceptions and fear floating around, both humans and animals suffer for it. We live in close quarters with reptiles and many of us see them everyday. Our community needs something like this. Reptilia Den will be a hub for information and understanding. Where enthusiasts can find camaraderie, parents can be put at ease, children can find wonder, and pets can go home with the perfect new families with all the information they need.

Having owned a similar business, I know this works! I know how to handle the challenges that owning a business can present. It is also my hope that my children will find inspiration in watching Reptilia Den prosper.




    Other ways you can help Can't contribute personally? You can still help! Please share the story of Reptilia Den on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or word of mouth. Every ounce gets us closer to success! I am also looking at adopting friendly reptiles that are in need of a new home. After a vet check and plenty of time to acclimate, these will become future stars of educational visits. They will receive special attention in my own home.

Over that time I have been involved with helping raise funds for Whole Planet Foundation. Whole Planet Foundation is the non-profit side of Whole Foods. 100% of the money raised goes to help fund microcredit loans. These loans help people pull themselves out of poverty. This year I get the opportunity to apply for a team member volunteer trip through Whole Foods to meet the individuals that have received these loans.  I will also be doing a community service project in the area we visit and get to see firsthand where we source some of our products.   How does your donation help me? Whole Foods pays for a large part of this trip. The team members that are chosen are in charge of funding their own plane tickets and shots. This is where I need your help! My top destinations include Africa, Costa Rica, and India. Most expenses I can cover on my own but for these farther destinations I do need some assistance to be able to go.     What do I get out this volunteer trip?When choosing my destinations I wanted to pick places where I could bring the most back with me. I see this as an experience to not only expand my life but to bring it home and enrich the lives of others with what I've learned. There are a few goals that I have for when I come back from my trip: 
Provide training for other team members in my store. 
Tie my new knowledge of products and the Whole Planet Foundation into free demos throughout our store. 
Have a ""meet and greet"" event with customers to show pictures, tell stories from the trip, and answer any questions that they may have. 
Host cooking classes built around the region that I visit. These classes will be delicious and informative.  
 What do you get out of helping me? I want to take you on this journey with me. Any time that I travel I always come back with photos, tips, and inspiration to try new things.For my perks I'm utilizing the things that I'm good at: 
I always take photos when I travel. You will get access to these photos and the opportunity to have me print them out in high quality to send to you. There will plenty to choose from and you can pick and choose your prints. Some examples of things I'll focus on are landscapes, close ups of details/designs , portraits of the people I meet, and everyday life.

<p>   
   My name is Katya Luniova. My husband and I are the owners of
SlavicBeauty.net, a small internet business that sells mini dairy equipment for
hobby farmers, homesteaders and small dairy farms. Our small <a href=""https://www.slavicbeauty.net/cream-separators/electric-and-manual-cream-separators"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>cream separator </span></a>has been a popular item since we started selling it in 2006.
SlavicBeauty.net has been successfully and steadily growing. We added small
butter churns and recently we added <a href=""https://www.slavicbeauty.net/milking-machine-systems"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>mini milkers</span></a>—complete
systems for milking cows, goats and sheep.  Please read more information
on our products below.</p>
<p>   
   The reason I am here is because our business desperately needs a
boost. SlavicBeauty is trying to stay afloat and develop at the same pace while
we are paying for my dad's cancer treatments.</p>
<p>Since spring 2015 we took a little bit over $40000 towards my father's treatment from our business budget.<br/><br/>My dad's and mom's monthly pension is $120 per month combined<br/><br/>Our family couldn't afford the treatment otherwise except for my business. It was our only choice.<br/><br/>There was no other alternative for my father to receive proper treatment. <br/><br/>I had to take the money out of the business and put it towards the treatment to help my father.<br/><br/>This created the funds shortage that keeps our business from developing at the same pace <br/><br/>Your contribution could help us turn things around and bounce back.<br/><br/>As perks we offer our cream separators and milking machines at discounted prices.<br/><br/>Any voluntarily no perk contribution is very much appreciated and can be added through ""contribute now"" button<br/></p>

<h3><b>The Story</b></h3>
<p>   
   In March 2015, my dad, Mykola Lunov, was diagnosed with stage IIIB lung cancer.
My dad has always been there for me. He has always been loving and caring. When
you grow up like this, you often take such things for granted. You do not even
realize how lucky you are till you are an adult and see that there are,
unfortunately, other examples.</p>
<p>   
 My mom and dad live in Ukraine. Both are retired now, but my mom was an
engineer and my dad was an architect. They get a monthly pension that equals
about USD 60 each. There is no health insurance in Ukraine because health care
is supposedly free, but, of course, it is not! Moreover, Ukrainian medical

<p>When I took my

never seen before. It was so hard seeing him so scared, helpless and lost. I
knew this was the time for me to be there for him! My husband and I did the
research and decided to take him to Germany for his cancer treatments. Germany
is close enough to Ukraine and offers excellent medical care. </p>

<h3><b>What We Need and What You Get</b></h3>
<p>   
    Here is our deal:  We offer our cream separators and mini
milkers at discounted prices as perks. All perks are available with BEFORE and AFTER CHRISTMAS delivery option. You will get our cream separator or a milker at a great price and help our business to turn things around and bounce back.</p><p>   
  All our cream separators come with a one-year warranty and our milkers
have a one-and-a-half-year warranty. We take pride in providing the best
customer service possible even after your warranty expires. All the spare parts
for cream separators and milkers are in stock in our warehouse in Michigan and

<p>   
    People usually imagine large, industrial units when they hear the
word ""cream separator.""  Our units are more of a kitchen
appliance, easy to clean and operate. </p>
<p> One does
not even need a cow or a goat. ""Cream Line"" milk is available
from small farms throughout the US. It is not considered raw, since it is
pasteurized, but it is perfect for separation since it is not homogenized. Our
cream separator is fun, easy and useful! And what a conversation piece! That
tasty butter your friends just had at dinner…imagine telling them you have made
it yourself.</p>

<h3><b>Where the Funds Will Go</b></h3>
<p>     We calculated that we would be able to afford the
treatment. We also realized it would take a toll on our business in the long
run. My friend suggested I do crowdfunding a while ago, but I felt quite shy
and uncertain. We invest most of our profit back into our business in
order for it to grow and develop.  We participate in such shows as World
Dairy Expo Madison, WI, ExpoTier (Germany) and others. We constantly look for
new products our customers might find interesting. All the medical bills have created
a financial shortage. We have a lot of plans and new ideas but not enough funds
to fulfill all of them. We could slow down and let the business grow back
slowly to where it was before, but this brings the ultimate fear of not being
able to afford my father's future medical treatments should he need any (I hope
he will not!).</p>
<p>   
  We have to stock up our warehouses, one in the USA and one in Europe, as
the holiday season approaches. We have to make prepayments for the
participation in EuroTier, a large expo in Germany, and World Dairy Expo in
Madison, WI. Place an advertisement in <i>The
Grit</i> magazine, as our promotion campaign. These are the things we usually
do but cannot fully afford at this time. We will also donate 5% of all funds we collect to this campaign
to Lung Cancer Research Foundation <a href=""http://www.lungcancerresearchfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.lungcancerresearchfoundation.org</span></a></p>
<p>to help them in
their work to fight this horrible disease.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>   
  There are really no risks to you. We already have a fully functioning
business, we just need a boost to keep it going at the same pace. We chose the
flexible funding plan, and even if we do not reach out goal, we will still be
able to fulfill all the perks in the promised time as all the products are in
the warehouse already. </p><div>
<h3><b> Gratitude</b></h3>
<p>   
 Regardless of your decision to participate, we thank you for your
attention! Get your cream separator and enjoy fresh cream and butter! Try one
of our milkers and see what a difference it makes and how much time it saves!
Not ready yet? Just a like or share on Facebook or a tweet or a retweet on
Twitter is a great help for us too. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to
tell your friends about our campaign! </p>

you and your loved ones health and happiness, because this is what everything really comes down to! </p>

What is
""SlavicBeauty.net"" and why are we here? 
   
   My name is Katya Luniova. My husband and I are the owners of
SlavicBeauty.net, a small internet business that sells mini dairy equipment for
hobby farmers, homesteaders and small dairy farms. Our small cream separator has been a popular item since we started selling it in 2006.
SlavicBeauty.net has been successfully and steadily growing. We added small
butter churns and recently we added mini milkers—complete
systems for milking cows, goats and sheep.  Please read more information
on our products below.
   
   The reason I am here is because our business desperately needs a
boost. SlavicBeauty is trying to stay afloat and develop at the same pace while
we are paying for my dad's cancer treatments.
Since spring 2015 we took a little bit over $40000 towards my father's treatment from our business budget.My dad's and mom's monthly pension is $120 per month combinedOur family couldn't afford the treatment otherwise except for my business. It was our only choice.There was no other alternative for my father to receive proper treatment. I had to take the money out of the business and put it towards the treatment to help my father.This created the funds shortage that keeps our business from developing at the same pace Your contribution could help us turn things around and bounce back.As perks we offer our cream separators and milking machines at discounted prices.Any voluntarily no perk contribution is very much appreciated and can be added through ""contribute now"" button



The Story
   
   In March 2015, my dad, Mykola Lunov, was diagnosed with stage IIIB lung cancer.
My dad has always been there for me. He has always been loving and caring. When
you grow up like this, you often take such things for granted. You do not even
realize how lucky you are till you are an adult and see that there are,
unfortunately, other examples.
   
 My mom and dad live in Ukraine. Both are retired now, but my mom was an
engineer and my dad was an architect. They get a monthly pension that equals
about USD 60 each. There is no health insurance in Ukraine because health care
is supposedly free, but, of course, it is not! Moreover, Ukrainian medical
care, unfortunately, is not progressive enough to often treat such an advanced
form of cancer successfully. 
When I took my
dad for his doctor's appointment last spring, I saw fear in his eyes that I had
never seen before. It was so hard seeing him so scared, helpless and lost. I
knew this was the time for me to be there for him! My husband and I did the
research and decided to take him to Germany for his cancer treatments. Germany
is close enough to Ukraine and offers excellent medical care. 


It is all in German, but I highlighted the diagnosis


    My
dad has been so strong in his fight with cancer. He has been through 4 cycles
of chemo and 34 rounds of radiation. He is up for his post treatment checkup on
November 10th.  At times, it has been really tough, but overall, it has
been a positive experience. Most importantly, I do not see the fear anymore in
his eyes! He is relaxed and he trusts his doctors. He feels protected. His
fight is not over yet and we do not know what lies ahead, but seeing him so
relaxed and positive is really worth all the effort.

Where the Funds Will Go
     We calculated that we would be able to afford the
treatment. We also realized it would take a toll on our business in the long
run. My friend suggested I do crowdfunding a while ago, but I felt quite shy
and uncertain. We invest most of our profit back into our business in
order for it to grow and develop.  We participate in such shows as World
Dairy Expo Madison, WI, ExpoTier (Germany) and others. We constantly look for
new products our customers might find interesting. All the medical bills have created
a financial shortage. We have a lot of plans and new ideas but not enough funds
to fulfill all of them. We could slow down and let the business grow back
slowly to where it was before, but this brings the ultimate fear of not being
able to afford my father's future medical treatments should he need any (I hope
he will not!).
   
  We have to stock up our warehouses, one in the USA and one in Europe, as
the holiday season approaches. We have to make prepayments for the
participation in EuroTier, a large expo in Germany, and World Dairy Expo in
Madison, WI. Place an advertisement in The
Grit magazine, as our promotion campaign. These are the things we usually
do but cannot fully afford at this time. We will also donate 5% of all funds we collect to this campaign
to Lung Cancer Research Foundation http://www.lungcancerresearchfoundation.org
to help them in
their work to fight this horrible disease.


Risks and Challenges
   
  There are really no risks to you. We already have a fully functioning
business, we just need a boost to keep it going at the same pace. We chose the
flexible funding plan, and even if we do not reach out goal, we will still be
able to fulfill all the perks in the promised time as all the products are in
the warehouse already. 
 Gratitude
   
 Regardless of your decision to participate, we thank you for your
attention! Get your cream separator and enjoy fresh cream and butter! Try one
of our milkers and see what a difference it makes and how much time it saves!
Not ready yet? Just a like or share on Facebook or a tweet or a retweet on

Thank you! We wish
you and your loved ones health and happiness, because this is what everything really comes down to!",9.0,1,"1 Campaign
