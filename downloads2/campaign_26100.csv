</p><p>The overall objective of the ATJ Tech Fellows program is to provide law students with an experiential understanding of the access to justice issues facing Americans and the knowledge to critically assess how innovation in the justice system can and is being used to address legal accessibility issues. This is something that is currently not widely taught in law school curriculums. A diverse core of fellows will gain the necessary skill set and leadership to leverage innovation and technology in assisting the implementation of legal services addressing access to justice issues in America.

<br/><h1><br/></h1><h1>Why ATJ Tech Fellows? Why Now?</h1><p></p>
<p>Our civil justice system is facing a crisis. Millions of Americans cannot afford the legal help they need when facing life-changing situations such as domestic violence, unlawful evictions, or the loss of veterans health or disability benefits. They’re left to navigate these complex legal situations on their own—and risk losing their families, homes, and livelihoods in the process.</p>
<p>Courts, legal aid organizations and law schools share a commitment to the principle that justice should be accessible to all. However, courts are swamped with millions of self-represented litigants struggling to resolve disputes on their own and legal aid organizations face massive unmet legal needs in their target client communities, often exceeding 80%.</p>

<p>Although there is a growing call in United States to spur innovation in service delivery to address the civil legal access problem, as highlighted in American Bar Association's Commission on The Future of Legal Services 2016 <a href=""http://www.americanbar.org/groups/centers_commissions/commission-on-the-future-of-legal-services.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Report</span></a>, the antiquated legal education system largely ignores access to justice as a discrete issue. Many law schools do not have curriculums that specifically focus on the larger systemic issues that account for the lack of access to justice in the U.S., yet alone train their students with the skills to innovatively respond to this crisis.</p>
<p>The ATJ Tech Fellows program hopes to place 10 fellows at host legal aid sites for the summer of 2017 and provide our fellows with a $5,000 stipend to help defray their living expenses for the 10-week, 400-hour commitment. At our current state, the program has partnered with several legal aid organizations to serve as host sites for our 2017 summer fellows. Some of the legal aid organizations include the Northwest Justice Project, Illinois Legal Aid Online, Alaska Legal Services Corp., and Legal Aid Services Oklahoma. The program has recruited several dedicated law student volunteers from Seattle University School of Law, who are assisting to build the program's infrastructure, partnerships with law schools and legal aid organizations and fundraising efforts. The ATJ Tech Fellows program recently made it through the quarterfinals stage for the Seattle Social Venture Partners Fast Pitch competition, where it hopes to gain a wealth of mentorship and organizational development.</p>

Art is a language that cuts across all borders and allows youth to express themselves and deal with issues in a positive way in a space that is safe and constructive. Art builds self esteem through experiencing the process of creating something from nothing and feeling proud about a finished piece.</p><p>Get Arty's program is designed to help youth enhance both independence and cooperation, and builds a sense of community. Through a variety of guest speakers and workshops integrated into the program, youth will also learn a variety of other skills such as portfolio building, which will provide information on how to pursue art as a career option. There has been countless examples of different ways youth benefit from art classes, but these benefits should not be limited, that’s why your contribution will provide access to local youth.</p><p>Our first-ever program in the <strong>Fall of 2016</strong> will provide an opportunity for up to 20 youth.

I was fortunate enough to have the materials I need to make art at home, as well as attend a variety of art classes growing up. Now, I have planned and taught art classes for youth, and the benefits I've had and the benefits I have seen my students have from art is remarkable. However, being an Interdisciplinary Social Science major at York University, I am very passionate about <strong>social justice</strong>, and do not believe access to art programs should be limited depending on location, finances, or other circumstances. That is why this campaign is so important to me. Get Artsy’s goal is to provide access to art classes for all youth. The magnitude of what your contribution will help achieve is beyond words because the experiences youth have with the arts now can have <strong>limitless impacts</strong> on them throughout their lives.""</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471324729/d9hzrtgr7yylv1a27jbt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>What We're is Hoping for from This Campaign</h3><p>Our aim is to generate <strong>$3000 </strong>in funding to launch Get Artsy’s series of 12-week art classes. This funding will be distributed to cover a variety of costs for the program. We estimate it will cost approximately $60 for each student to participate, so one option is to sponsor a student to attend the classes. However, additionally funding is also required to cover costs such as facility space, guest speakers, supplies, etc.</p><p>The campaign goal is the minimum amount of funds that we are requesting to get this program off the ground. This will cover the the supplies and location cost, but all other expenses will be covered through volunteer participation and in kind donations. Anything over our goal will be applied to additional sessions of the program throughout the year, and to help us better the current program.</p><p>In addition to providing youth with this amazing opportunity, some perks to get excited about when donating may include a social media shout, receiving an original piece of art from the students, or being named as a Presenting Sponsor.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Our Team and Partners</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471324122/egdmuptafomazikr0zln.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>Valerie Paniccia</strong>, Founder​ &amp; Facilitator<br/>With experience planning and teaching a variety of programs (including art) to Brampton youth, Valerie has seen how important art can be in youth development and has a vision to make this opportunity accessible to all.

It will also be located at the schools themselves (or very close by) right after school, which means easy access for participants. Rather than simply focusing on art skills, Get Artsy’s program planning will combine art skills with life skills such as self-confidence, dealing with issues, socializing with peers, and more.</p><p><strong>What benefits will the participants receive from this program?</strong><br/>The participants will not only develop their art skills and creativity, but they will learn how to create a portfolio, how to go about pursuing art as a career option, gain confidence in themselves, as well as learn to work well and socialize with others.

The more people that are aware of Get Artsy and our cause, the better. So please share our campaign using the Indiegogo share tools. If you are interested in making an in-kind donation (such as supplies or refreshments) or sponsoring the program beyond this campaign, let us know via email! We could also use volunteers to help launch our program so if you out interested in helping please get in touch! <strong>getartsy@accesscharity.ca</strong></p></div>","Get Artsy's goal is to provide art classes to youth who are otherwise unable to access this type of much-needed education. The program will help youth become aware of career options, open their mindset, create a safe space and a sense of community, and learn to express themselves through the arts.Through weekly classes led by youth facilitators, including peer learning, guest speakers and mentors, the first round of our 12-week program will take place in Brampton and is open to all youth in need.  Our ImpactThe significant impact art has on youth, as well as the unique programming of Get Artsy will ensure your contribution will make a difference. Art is a language that cuts across all borders and allows youth to express themselves and deal with issues in a positive way in a space that is safe and constructive. Art builds self esteem through experiencing the process of creating something from nothing and feeling proud about a finished piece.Get Arty's program is designed to help youth enhance both independence and cooperation, and builds a sense of community. Through a variety of guest speakers and workshops integrated into the program, youth will also learn a variety of other skills such as portfolio building, which will provide information on how to pursue art as a career option. There has been countless examples of different ways youth benefit from art classes, but these benefits should not be limited, that’s why your contribution will provide access to local youth.Our first-ever program in the Fall of 2016 will provide an opportunity for up to 20 youth. With your support and grant funding, Get Artsy will continue to hold a 12-week session, 3 times a year! Why Start Get Artsy?BY VALERIE | Founder of Get Artsy""Ever since I was young and my dad would set up an easel in our living room to paint with me, I have always turned to art to express myself. I was fortunate enough to have the materials I need to make art at home, as well as attend a variety of art classes growing up. Now, I have planned and taught art classes for youth, and the benefits I've had and the benefits I have seen my students have from art is remarkable. However, being an Interdisciplinary Social Science major at York University, I am very passionate about social justice, and do not believe access to art programs should be limited depending on location, finances, or other circumstances. That is why this campaign is so important to me. Get Artsy’s goal is to provide access to art classes for all youth. The magnitude of what your contribution will help achieve is beyond words because the experiences youth have with the arts now can have limitless impacts on them throughout their lives."" What We're is Hoping for from This CampaignOur aim is to generate $3000 in funding to launch Get Artsy’s series of 12-week art classes. This funding will be distributed to cover a variety of costs for the program. We estimate it will cost approximately $60 for each student to participate, so one option is to sponsor a student to attend the classes. However, additionally funding is also required to cover costs such as facility space, guest speakers, supplies, etc.The campaign goal is the minimum amount of funds that we are requesting to get this program off the ground. This will cover the the supplies and location cost, but all other expenses will be covered through volunteer participation and in kind donations. Anything over our goal will be applied to additional sessions of the program throughout the year, and to help us better the current program.In addition to providing youth with this amazing opportunity, some perks to get excited about when donating may include a social media shout, receiving an original piece of art from the students, or being named as a Presenting Sponsor. Our Team and PartnersValerie Paniccia, Founder​ & FacilitatorWith experience planning and teaching a variety of programs (including art) to Brampton youth, Valerie has seen how important art can be in youth development and has a vision to make this opportunity accessible to all. Valerie has a passion for both art and social justice and is in the Concurrent Education program studying Visual Arts and Interdisciplinary Social Science at York University in hopes of making a change in the lives of youth.Jenna Imbrogno, Assistant FacilitatorA current student at the University of Toronto, Jenna has been an artist for over 11 years. It has been her passion and hobby since she was younger. Jenna won the Herzog Hospital Art competition and her painting was sent to Israel where it is is now in the hospital wing for sick children. Jenna believes that art has the power to inspire and guide people no matter where they come from in life, and cannot wait to see how it will have a positive impact on the students Get Artsy encounters.ACCESS, Organizational MentorAs a youth-led organization based in Brampton, ACCESS has been making an impact locally and globally for 10 years. Today, ACCESS supports a number of new youth-led organizations and projects throughout the GTA and will be mentoring the Get Artsy program.Therese Guidolin, AdvisorWith 20 years of event planning, coordination, wedding planning and destination wedding planning experience, Therese is an active community member who has supported numerous non-profits and community projects.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhy is Get Artsy different from other art classes?Since Get Artsy is a non-profit organization, it will provide FREE art classes for youth who may not be able to afford other programming. It will also be located at the schools themselves (or very close by) right after school, which means easy access for participants. Rather than simply focusing on art skills, Get Artsy’s program planning will combine art skills with life skills such as self-confidence, dealing with issues, socializing with peers, and more.What benefits will the participants receive from this program?The participants will not only develop their art skills and creativity, but they will learn how to create a portfolio, how to go about pursuing art as a career option, gain confidence in themselves, as well as learn to work well and socialize with others. This program will provide a safe and constructive environment for students to go after school and develop new skills.What do you hope to achieve at the end of the program?By the end of the program, we hope each participant will take something away from the class, and even what to come back. What each participant will gain may vary by person. For example, one achievement may be a student getting accepted into an art school with the portfolio they built with us, whereas another achievement could simply be an individual gaining confidence and making friends.

<p><strong>Early Marriage and circumcision for the young Maasai girls</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where every child is educated and can contribute to the development process!!</p>
<p>So many times parents in Maasai  areas tend to give away their young girls for marriage in exchange for just a kilogram of sugar, a goat, a cow , some tea leaves and sometimes for salt. These young girls are then subjected to domestic violence, torture, early child birth and many times girls have died while giving birth because their bodies are never ready to experience child birth.</p>
<p>Many times the parents to these girls need to be empowered with information about the benefits of keeping their children in school until they complete their education. Once these girls have acquired the education, they can provide all the above mentioned items to their parents for the rest of their lives. All that parents need to to practice some bit of patience and sacrifice a little in order to enjoy the fruits of their children.</p>
<p><strong>Circumcision </strong>for the women is prohibited but Maasai societies they still circumcise their young girls. We are working hard to educate them so that they can stop this.</p>
<p>Its time to reach out to the parents in the Maasai land settings and sensitize them if we want a better future for girls. A future where they can participate in leadership positions. A future where they can make informed choices and start up families the the men of their choice.</p>
<p>The time is now. Lets teach the Parents because they need this knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Young Maasai Kids in the bush keeping cows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Education: </strong>Most of Maasai children don't go to school due to the environment they are living. Their parent don't understand the importance of their children to get better education. So we are trying our level best to educate these Maasai societies so that they can allow their children to go to school. Also there are scarcity of nearest school in their areas so we are working hard to build school near them to attract and convince their parent to allow them to attend school.</p>
<p>Our effort made us to start building Pambazuka Naisinyai School <a href=""http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz</a>  for which this school started under the tree but with our own effort we have managed to build some two classes and bought some desks so we need to work hard to make it happen!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We decided to start a school in Maasai society so as to convince the Maasai on Education. Maasai society is leaving a life with no permanent settlement, thus not getting a chance for schooling. Also the society lives a life of animal husbandry which is difficult for parents to allow their children in distant schools due to they depend of them for rearing animals. Therefore starting a school within Maasai society will convince parents allowing their children to attend school near by them. That is the school I started within Maasai society is purposely to help the Maasai children. It is called PAMBAZUKA NAISINYAI PRE &amp; PRIMARY SCHOOL         <a href=""http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz</a>   . Already our school has grade one (1) with 65 pupils , grade two with 55 and grade three with 35  pupils and 4 teachers who use most of their time teaching the children for most of them can’t speak neither Swahili nor English, but Maasai language.</p>

<p><strong>Our School Started under the tree</strong></p>
<p>Our school started under the tree as we do not have resources to help us for building classes for the Maasai children. Education should start with their parents to educate them so that they can know the importance of education to their children. Some of the parents are now aware about education to their children so they are allowing them to attend school. We are still talking to the parents so that they can give us a good cooperation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> NEW TWO CLASSES</strong></p>
<p>Through our own efforts we have managed to build two classes where grade one and two are using for studying. We have more 10 acres where we want to build more classes as we have more students coming soon. We want to build more classes up to seven classes, we also need to build kitchen, toilet as the one we have is not enough, computers and computer lab, well for keeping water as there is scarcity of water, desks, books, office for teachers, salaries for teachers.</p>

<p><strong>THE FOLLOWING ARE THE REASONS AS TO WHY MY PROJECT IS VALUABLE TO DONORS AND THE WORLD</strong></p>
<p>  This project is very important to donors and world at large for it will connect us with Maasai society for they shall be able to communicate with different people of different nations of the world. Also this will give chance for donors to come and visit Maasai society and learn the real life and culture of Maasai. Apart from that it also helps to eradicate the number of illiterates in the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>1. Due to studying environment being of low standard life, it is difficult to get skilled teachers and faithful constructors.</p>
<p>2. Another challenge is teacher's salaries, where by in order to get good trainers you also have to pay them well.</p>
<p>3. Another challenge is that , the pupils are fluently speaking Maasai native language, while their teachers don’t know the language and thus difficult to teach them</p>
<p>4. Due to that parents couldn’t get education, and then they find no importance to take their children to school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> <strong>HOW TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>1. Improving the teaching environment so as to encourage trained teachers to come and teach in our school. Also getting enough trusted constructors for constructing the building.</p>
<p>2. Increasing teacher's salaries so as to motivate the coming of more teachers.</p>
<p>3. Educating parents’ house by house on the importance of taking their children to school.</p>

<p>The old adage “It takes a village to raise a child” could not
be truer than it is today. Route247’s virtual village unites students, parents,
teachers and the community on a platform that connects students to valuable opportunities in and outside of their
school. These opportunities include: volunteering, internships, jobs, scholarships, and challenges, all of which empower students to strengthen
themselves, their school community and their greater community.</p>
<p>On paper, the Route247 team consists of duo-Maria and Lisa. Between
us, we have worked in education on three different continents at the elementary,
middle and high school levels in both the public and private sectors. But the
real Route247 team extends to the countless parents, students, teachers, school
administrators, business owners, and community members who have provided
insight, feedback, enthusiasm and motivation. 
Thank you for helping us to construct the blueprint for this vision and
for continuing to campaign on behalf of Route247.</p>
<p>With over 15 million high school students in the United States,
Route247 can make a considerable change in the lives of many. Join the movement

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of a corporate sponsor as
well as a private donor, we were able to construct a functional skeleton of the
program and technology. <span>After just a week of
promotional videos in a local high school, over 400 students expressed interest
in a Route247 leadership position. Having started this program rooted in the
confidence that students are willing, capable, and incredible agents of change,
we were inspired by this response. A couple of months into the 2015-16 academic
year, we had over 700 students and 40 teachers registered within the high
school. In a nearby elementary school, we worked with a single classroom of 19
students. Field-testing certain components of the program, we were able to
garner feedback from education administrators, teachers, students, parents,
businesses, web developers, legal counsel, and countless others. This helped
determine the changes to the technology, curriculum and program logistics necessary
for Route247 to be more meaningful and impactful.</span></p>
<p>It will take approximately
$60,000 to make the necessary upgrades to this innovative technology, so it is more
user-friendly, secure, automated, aesthetically-pleasing, scalable, and
adaptable. That certainly seems like a hefty sum until we consider just two (of
the many) alternatives:  </p>
<p>Each year’s class of dropouts
costs our country $200 billion in lost earnings and lost tax revenue in
their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Cutting that number in half
nationally would decrease annual Medicaid spending by as much as $7.3 billion.</p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Did you find yourself often bored in class?</p>
<p>Did you ever wish your
school experience had better prepared you for life after school?</p>
<p>Did you find out much
later in life that you were good at or enjoyed something you didn't previously know about?</p>
<p>Whether as a student, parent,
or teacher, have you ever been frustrated with our education system, but unsure how to
change it?</p>

who have the resources and tools to turn their dreams into a shared reality. </p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>With the educational
technology boom, we did not want to reinvent the wheel. And, of course, there
are projects out there doing incredible things with both bigger budgets and
bigger spheres of influence. </p>
<p>However, we are carving
out a nice niche by several distinguishing features, inlcuding: </p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>We are one of the only student-run programs out there.</p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>When a school licenses the program, every student can create an
account. That program equity ensures that each student has access to Route247’s
opportunities, perks and benefits.</p>
<p>3.<span>  </span>As a significant indicator of a student’s academic success, parental
involvement factors into both the technology design as well as the
opportunities.</p>
<p>4.<span>  </span>There is a curriculum component to the program so that these
opportunities, although experiential-based, compliment classroom learning.</p>
<p>5.<span>  </span>Web-based platforms invite more collaboration than competition.
Integrating with others, we can devise ways to enrich our individual endeavors,
expand our reach and affect greater change.</p>
<p>We are proud to say that
we have already received endorsements from several parties in the educational
community, including the local superintendent’s office. With this forward
momentum, we are on track to expand this virtual village across the United
States!</p>

are projects out there doing incredible things with both bigger budgets and
bigger spheres of influence. 
However, we are carving
out a nice niche by several distinguishing features, inlcuding: 
1.  We are one of the only student-run programs out there.
2.  When a school licenses the program, every student can create an
account. That program equity ensures that each student has access to Route247’s
opportunities, perks and benefits.
3.  As a significant indicator of a student’s academic success, parental
involvement factors into both the technology design as well as the
opportunities.
4.  There is a curriculum component to the program so that these
opportunities, although experiential-based, compliment classroom learning.
5.  Web-based platforms invite more collaboration than competition.
Integrating with others, we can devise ways to enrich our individual endeavors,
expand our reach and affect greater change.
We are proud to say that
we have already received endorsements from several parties in the educational
community, including the local superintendent’s office. With this forward
momentum, we are on track to expand this virtual village across the United
States!
   Other Ways You Can Help 
Wouldn’t it be beautiful
to hear the national dialogue on education boast: Every 26 seconds, a high
school student shares a success story?
It has a nice ring to it,
doesn’t it? Let’s start our success stories here. Of course, no contribution is
too small; every dollar counts! But even if you are unable to donate at this
time, you can still be an agent of change. Help us to spread the word about
Route247’s movement. Use your 26 seconds to like our Facebook page, check out
our website, and create and submit opportunities for
students.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Help Restore Two Historic Fighter-Bombers Back to their Former Glory!</h3>
<p>The congressionally chartered, Smithsonian affiliated <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History</a> - a non-profit museum located in Albuquerque, New Mexico - is restoring two of its iconic fighter-bombers, the F-105D Thunderchief and A-7 Corsair II.</p>
<p>This dual restoration initiative is a special project within <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Operation Preservation</i></a>, an ongoing campaign to repaint and refurbish the iconic aircraft in the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History's nine-acre outdoor exhibit area, <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/see/exhibits/heritage-park/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heritage Park</a>. </p>
<p>Our museum's historic <strong>F-105D Thunderchief</strong> - a supersonic fighter-bomber that was sent to Germany to provide NATO nuclear retaliation capability during the depths of the Cold War - and the museum's <strong>A-7 Corsair II</strong> - one of the Navy's most capable attack aircraft that is also the only aircraft in the museum's collection to have ever flown in combat missions - have both experienced the ravages of the Southwestern weather, and we would like to ask for your support in paying for the surface preparation and painting of the exteriors of the two aircraft. </p>
<p>By bringing these important airplanes back to life, we hope to connect museum visitors with these pivotal pieces of Cold War history, and celebrate their many contributions to the United States Navy, United State Air Force, and to American history. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490906597/p4hnq0bckfohdaig9jcn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The total restoration cost for both airplanes is expected to be $45,000. A little more than half will be paid by this Indiegogo project. The money raised in this campaign will be used for the cosmetic restoration of the fuselage and wings on both aircraft. That is, to purchase the paint ($460) per gallon and primer ($300 per gallon), prepare the airplanes' surfaces and then paint the fuselages and wings of both planes.</p>
<p><i>The reason why the primer and paint for this project are so expensive is the paint must last a long time. In the Southwest region of the United States, normal paint or even MilSpec paint is only good for 3-5 years. The NAPA premium automotive primer and finish we will use is guaranteed for 15-20 years. In addition, we must choose a paint and a color that is approved by the United States Air Force and other museum entities.</i></p>
<p>The F-105D will be the first aircraft to be repainted, receiving trim and insignia to look as it did when it was active in the 49th TFW in Germany as part of NATO. After its completion, focus will then move toward the A-7, repainting the surface to revive the paint colors of orange and grey that it currently displays. Restoration of both aircraft will begin in Spring of 2017 under the supervision of Brigadier General (Ret.) Jay Bledsoe, Restoration Project Manager, with the help from museum staff and volunteers.</p>
<p>With a quickly approaching target completion date for the restoration of both aircraft of August, 2017, we ask you to please consider becoming a member of the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History's F-105D Thunderchief and A-7 Corsair II Restoration Team by making a donation through Indiegogo! As a part of this support team, you will personally help in the preservation of these iconic airplanes.</p>

<h3>About the F-105D Thunderchief</h3>
<p>When the Thunderchief entered service, it was the largest single-seat, single-engine combat aircraft in history, and it could exceed the speed of sound at sea level and reach Mach 2 at high altitude. Built by Republic Aviation – with a length of 64 feet and 4.75 inches and a wingspan of 34 feet and 11.25 inches – the F-105 conducted the majority of strike bombing missions during the early years of the Vietnam War. During the war, the single-seat F-105D was the primary aircraft delivering the heavy bomb loads against the various military targets.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491328147/eczwoy1koj2lmefs8nab.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491336335/owqa5vtauzbpgawiuzb4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Restoration will begin this spring on the museum’s F-105D Thunderchief, serial number 61-0107, a supersonic fighter-bomber that was produced in 1962 by Republic Aviation, Farmingdale, NY, and was sent to the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) in Germany to provide NATO nuclear retaliation capability during the depths of the Cold War. </p>
<p><i>(In the late 1960s, the Defense Budget began to be squeezed by the costs of the ongoing Vietnam War. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara decided to reduce costs in Europe by ""Dual Basing"" United States military units in Europe by returning them permanently to the United States, and conducting annual deployment exercises in Europe, giving the units a NATO commitment for deployment to bases in Europe if tensions with the Soviet Union warranted an immediate military buildup.</i></p>
<p><i>The 49th Tactical Fighter Wing was returned to the United States under this policy, being reassigned on July 1, 1968, to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, to serve as the U.S. Air Force's first dual-based, NATO-committed wing. The 49th TFW is still stationed at Holloman AFB, New Mexico.)</i></p>
<p>After its use for pilot training in McConnell AFB, Kansas, and Nellis AFB, Nevada, it joined the Kansas Air National Guard at McConnell, AFB. It was later transferred to the Washington D.C. Air National Guard in 1979. It landed for the final time at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM, in 1981.</p>
<p>Kirtland AFB was only supposed to be a location for the aircraft to refuel on its way to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center, or “Boneyard,” in Tucson, AZ, but complications prevented it from leaving Albuquerque. On its takeoff from Kirtland, it lost power and the pilot dropped an emergency hook from the back of the plane to catch the one-inch steel cable that stretched across the runway at the Albuquerque International Airport. The pilot was not injured, and after the aircraft was repaired, it was offered to the then National Atomic Museum for permanent display. It has now been a part of the museum’s collection for 35 years.</p>

<h3>About the A-7 Corsair II</h3>
<p>The A-7 was, from 1967 until 1992, one of the most cost effective and capable attack aircraft in the Navy’s inventory. The museum’s A-7 Corsair II is a TA-7C model; converted from a single seat A-7E to a two seat TA-7C in 1976. Built by Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) Aerospace Corporation – with a length of 46 feet and 2 inches and a wingspan of 38 feet and 9 inches – a total of 1,569 A-7 aircraft were produced, fighting in both Vietnam and Iraq. Although they were not the fastest aircraft, they had a solid reputation with pilots as a reliable aircraft that could deliver weapons with great accuracy. It also holds the distinction of being the only single seat jet fighter-bomber that was designed, built and deployed into combat, all during the Vietnam War.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491333071/nbomi3dxoyuu1eyps42w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The second aircraft to receive restoration attention this spring and summer will be the museum’s A-7 Corsair II, Bureau Number 154-407, the only aircraft in the museum’s collection to have ever flown in combat missions. This Navy carrier fighter-bomber was built in 1968, and in its first eight years in service, the aircraft saw numerous cruises including several Vietnam deployments. Within this timeframe, it had 3,338 flight hours and 731 carrier launches and landings.</p>
<p>This aircraft was modified and upgraded over the next few years, stationed at two different Naval Air Stations where it was continually involved in flight test work until its aircraft lifetime expired. During its service, it was instrumental in training pilots in nuclear weapons delivery tactics and in developing and testing weapons for weapon delivery. Its last flight was to Albuquerque where it was used for parts and training, having accumulated 5,796.6 flight hours. It joined the museum’s collection in 1992.</p>

<p>The most current example of the museum's aircraft restoration work can be seen in last year's <i>Operation Preservation</i> project that involved restoring our <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/b-52b-stratofortress-restoration-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">B-52B Stratofortress</a> s/n 52-0013, one of only a few B-models left in existence and one of only four in the world on display for public viewing. Restoration of the B-52B began in April of 2016 under the supervision of Restoration Project Coordinator, Major Jerry Hanks, USMC (Retired), with help from Museum staff and volunteers and was funded by donations received from supporters and entities with personal ties to the Museum and the historic aircraft. The Museum also successfully raised over $120,000 through multiple initiatives, including an <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/b52-restoration/x/13393474#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo</a> campaign, special events and generous support from donors and organizations. </p>
<p>Restoration included the B-52B receiving bodywork and a new coat of primer and paint. Completion of this outdoor exhibit for visitor viewing took place in September 2016. The Museum held a dedication ceremony on Thursday, October 13, 2016, where dignitaries were present to publicly acknowledge the legacy and historical significance of the B-52B Stratofortress.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest risk to this project is in not having the two aircraft sufficiently restored so that they can be dedicated in the Fall of 2017. At a minimum, this means that both aircraft must be fully painted. For this to happen, the funding must be secured, the body work must be completed, the primer and paint applied and insignias painted.</p>
<p>Mitigation strategies that have been put in place include a schedule that includes time for unknowns such as weather and fluctuation in manpower. In addition, work to secure funds and manpower was started in mid-2016.</p>
<p>Overall, there is little risk that the project will not be completed. The restoration of both the F-105D and the A-7 is the museum's top priority in 2017, and the museum has an excellent track record of completing aircraft projects. The largest, completed between 2009 and 2011, was the relocation of all aircraft and other Heritage Park exhibits from the Museum's first home, when it was located on Kirtland Air Force Base, to its current location. More recently, the Museum successfully completed the full restoration of the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/b-52b-stratofortress-restoration-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">B-52B Stratofortress</a>, the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/b-29-restoration-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">B-29 Superfortress</a>, the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/completed-f-16-fighting-falcon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a> and the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/completed-sub-sail-restoration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USS James K.

</div></div>","Help Restore Two Historic Fighter-Bombers Back to their Former Glory!
The congressionally chartered, Smithsonian affiliated National Museum of Nuclear Science & History - a non-profit museum located in Albuquerque, New Mexico - is restoring two of its iconic fighter-bombers, the F-105D Thunderchief and A-7 Corsair II.
This dual restoration initiative is a special project within Operation Preservation, an ongoing campaign to repaint and refurbish the iconic aircraft in the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History's nine-acre outdoor exhibit area, Heritage Park. 
Our museum's historic F-105D Thunderchief - a supersonic fighter-bomber that was sent to Germany to provide NATO nuclear retaliation capability during the depths of the Cold War - and the museum's A-7 Corsair II - one of the Navy's most capable attack aircraft that is also the only aircraft in the museum's collection to have ever flown in combat missions - have both experienced the ravages of the Southwestern weather, and we would like to ask for your support in paying for the surface preparation and painting of the exteriors of the two aircraft. 
By bringing these important airplanes back to life, we hope to connect museum visitors with these pivotal pieces of Cold War history, and celebrate their many contributions to the United States Navy, United State Air Force, and to American history. 



The total restoration cost for both airplanes is expected to be $45,000. A little more than half will be paid by this Indiegogo project. The money raised in this campaign will be used for the cosmetic restoration of the fuselage and wings on both aircraft. That is, to purchase the paint ($460) per gallon and primer ($300 per gallon), prepare the airplanes' surfaces and then paint the fuselages and wings of both planes.
The reason why the primer and paint for this project are so expensive is the paint must last a long time. In the Southwest region of the United States, normal paint or even MilSpec paint is only good for 3-5 years. The NAPA premium automotive primer and finish we will use is guaranteed for 15-20 years. In addition, we must choose a paint and a color that is approved by the United States Air Force and other museum entities.
The F-105D will be the first aircraft to be repainted, receiving trim and insignia to look as it did when it was active in the 49th TFW in Germany as part of NATO. After its completion, focus will then move toward the A-7, repainting the surface to revive the paint colors of orange and grey that it currently displays. Restoration of both aircraft will begin in Spring of 2017 under the supervision of Brigadier General (Ret.) Jay Bledsoe, Restoration Project Manager, with the help from museum staff and volunteers.
With a quickly approaching target completion date for the restoration of both aircraft of August, 2017, we ask you to please consider becoming a member of the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History's F-105D Thunderchief and A-7 Corsair II Restoration Team by making a donation through Indiegogo! As a part of this support team, you will personally help in the preservation of these iconic airplanes.


 
About the F-105D Thunderchief
When the Thunderchief entered service, it was the largest single-seat, single-engine combat aircraft in history, and it could exceed the speed of sound at sea level and reach Mach 2 at high altitude. Built by Republic Aviation – with a length of 64 feet and 4.75 inches and a wingspan of 34 feet and 11.25 inches – the F-105 conducted the majority of strike bombing missions during the early years of the Vietnam War. During the war, the single-seat F-105D was the primary aircraft delivering the heavy bomb loads against the various military targets.


Restoration will begin this spring on the museum’s F-105D Thunderchief, serial number 61-0107, a supersonic fighter-bomber that was produced in 1962 by Republic Aviation, Farmingdale, NY, and was sent to the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) in Germany to provide NATO nuclear retaliation capability during the depths of the Cold War. 
(In the late 1960s, the Defense Budget began to be squeezed by the costs of the ongoing Vietnam War. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara decided to reduce costs in Europe by ""Dual Basing"" United States military units in Europe by returning them permanently to the United States, and conducting annual deployment exercises in Europe, giving the units a NATO commitment for deployment to bases in Europe if tensions with the Soviet Union warranted an immediate military buildup.
The 49th Tactical Fighter Wing was returned to the United States under this policy, being reassigned on July 1, 1968, to Holloman AFB, New Mexico, to serve as the U.S. Air Force's first dual-based, NATO-committed wing. The 49th TFW is still stationed at Holloman AFB, New Mexico.)
After its use for pilot training in McConnell AFB, Kansas, and Nellis AFB, Nevada, it joined the Kansas Air National Guard at McConnell, AFB. It was later transferred to the Washington D.C. Air National Guard in 1979. It landed for the final time at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, NM, in 1981.
Kirtland AFB was only supposed to be a location for the aircraft to refuel on its way to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center, or “Boneyard,” in Tucson, AZ, but complications prevented it from leaving Albuquerque. On its takeoff from Kirtland, it lost power and the pilot dropped an emergency hook from the back of the plane to catch the one-inch steel cable that stretched across the runway at the Albuquerque International Airport. The pilot was not injured, and after the aircraft was repaired, it was offered to the then National Atomic Museum for permanent display. It has now been a part of the museum’s collection for 35 years.

About the A-7 Corsair II
The A-7 was, from 1967 until 1992, one of the most cost effective and capable attack aircraft in the Navy’s inventory. The museum’s A-7 Corsair II is a TA-7C model; converted from a single seat A-7E to a two seat TA-7C in 1976. Built by Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV) Aerospace Corporation – with a length of 46 feet and 2 inches and a wingspan of 38 feet and 9 inches – a total of 1,569 A-7 aircraft were produced, fighting in both Vietnam and Iraq. Although they were not the fastest aircraft, they had a solid reputation with pilots as a reliable aircraft that could deliver weapons with great accuracy. It also holds the distinction of being the only single seat jet fighter-bomber that was designed, built and deployed into combat, all during the Vietnam War.


The second aircraft to receive restoration attention this spring and summer will be the museum’s A-7 Corsair II, Bureau Number 154-407, the only aircraft in the museum’s collection to have ever flown in combat missions. This Navy carrier fighter-bomber was built in 1968, and in its first eight years in service, the aircraft saw numerous cruises including several Vietnam deployments. Within this timeframe, it had 3,338 flight hours and 731 carrier launches and landings.
This aircraft was modified and upgraded over the next few years, stationed at two different Naval Air Stations where it was continually involved in flight test work until its aircraft lifetime expired. During its service, it was instrumental in training pilots in nuclear weapons delivery tactics and in developing and testing weapons for weapon delivery. Its last flight was to Albuquerque where it was used for parts and training, having accumulated 5,796.6 flight hours. It joined the museum’s collection in 1992.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As a Moodle developer, I have been passionate about Moodle development for years. I have developed and contributed to over twenty plugins, including the Questionnaire activity.</p>
<p>Questionnaire is maintained and improved by myself and Poet Open Source, and is actively supported and contributed to by the Moodle community.</p>
<p>A top community request is to provide the ability to export individual and summary results to a printable format, namely PDF. This project hopes to raise the necessary funding to begin adding these features to the Moodle questionnaire activity.</p>
<p>This campaign was run earlier, and raised $235, far short of the target. After it closed, other backers came forward indicating they would like to contribute. Total known pledges are approximately $5000. This would get most of the features developed. This new campaign will use the funds from the previous campaign, and add new pledges to get the project done.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Efforts have begun to define the requirements and results of this project. Funding is needed to continue this work so that the features can reach completion.</p>
<p>This project will focus on two main features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Providing the ability for the summary results page to be exported to PDF format.</li>
<li>Providing the ability for each individual results page to be exported to PDF format.</li>
</ol>
<p>To complete both features, I am looking for CAD$7,100.00. To complete just the first feature, I need CAD$5,000.00. These funds will pay for:</p>
<ol>
<li>The initial consultation and design work (already completed).</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
As a Moodle developer, I have been passionate about Moodle development for years. I have developed and contributed to over twenty plugins, including the Questionnaire activity.
Questionnaire is maintained and improved by myself and Poet Open Source, and is actively supported and contributed to by the Moodle community.
A top community request is to provide the ability to export individual and summary results to a printable format, namely PDF. This project hopes to raise the necessary funding to begin adding these features to the Moodle questionnaire activity.
This campaign was run earlier, and raised $235, far short of the target. After it closed, other backers came forward indicating they would like to contribute. Total known pledges are approximately $5000. This would get most of the features developed. This new campaign will use the funds from the previous campaign, and add new pledges to get the project done.
What We Need & What You Get
Efforts have begun to define the requirements and results of this project. Funding is needed to continue this work so that the features can reach completion.
This project will focus on two main features:

Providing the ability for the summary results page to be exported to PDF format.
Providing the ability for each individual results page to be exported to PDF format.

To complete both features, I am looking for CAD$7,100.00. To complete just the first feature, I need CAD$5,000.00. These funds will pay for:

The initial consultation and design work (already completed).
The export to PDF code structure and API's that will provide the foundation to build the two features.
The summary report export to PDF feature.
The individual report export to PDF feature.
Documentation of the new features in the Moodledocs open community pages.
Code release and management on Github.
Plugin release in the Moodle plugins database.

All work will be done openly, under the Moodle GPL license and made available as Open Source through Github and the Moodle plugins directory.

<h3>Introduction By Lacy </h3>
<p>For 21 years, I witnessed men leave prison not only ill-prepared to reenter society and their lives, but some were worse off than when they went into prison. Some had become better criminals, some had become more entrenched in a victim mentality, and some were angrier than ever before. </p>
<p><strong>And we ask ourselves, why are our recidivism rates so high? </strong></p>
<p>In short, men and women who are sentenced to prison, are often sentenced with an underlying societal assumption that going to prison is the “punishment they deserve” for crimes committed and that their experience in prison will serve as a deterrent from committing future crimes. Clearly, the statistics show that one’s prison experience lacks the power to effectively change the underlying thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that motivate repeat criminal acts. </p>
<p>I believe the answer lies in offering self-help programs, empowerment programs, and/or programs that get to the root of human behavior, the heart of personal change, and the keys to long term transformation. I also believe that a solid reentry approach would include these types of programming both inside and outside of prison that would work together to ensure a smooth transition back into society and set a returning citizen up for success.</p>
<p>Following my own traumatic life experience that required a new skill set and shift in perspective, I developed an innovative, holistic, and transformational self-help program for offenders releasing from federal prison.  This program was based in my belief that all people have innate value and talent, the ability to acquire a new skill set to change their lives, and the ability to shift their perspective to transform their lives. </p>
<p>Upon my retirement from the Federal Prison System, I reconnected with over 50% of the former participants in my program.  It was clear through the conversations with these men and their families that a different approach to self-help and self-empowerment classes prior to their release had a significant positive impact on their successful reentry back into their lives and into society. </p>
<p>In this process of witnessing and hearing their stories of reentry and reunification, I knew that there was a powerful story to tell the world. The story is not just about those incarcerated in a physical prison, but a story that includes the realization that many people feel imprisoned in their own every day lives. </p>
<p><strong>Freeing An Incarcerated World</strong> is a story and a movement to help us all to Free Ourselves From Ourselves.  <br/> </p>
<h3>Overview of the Film</h3>
<p><strong>Freeing An Incarcerated World </strong>is a documentary film that ignites hope, inspiration, motivation, and a profound sense of positive possibility and freedom in all who see it.</p>
<p>Former federal prison psychologist, Dr. Lacy Frazer, is joined by John Milisitz and several other courageous men that share their stories of personal transformation while in one of the darkest of places, <i>prison</i>.  The viewer not only bears witness to the journey from incarceration to freedom, but is challenged to look at their own personal imprisonment in its myriad of forms.  </p>
<p>Change is Inevitable, but Transformation is a Choice.  </p>
<p>Every man or woman who goes to prison changes in one way or another . . . but only a few use the time to truly transform.  The stories of these men and women provide real life examples of the Journey of Personal Transformation and offer an illustrative map for others to follow who have ever felt trapped, stuck, limited, or imprisoned themselves.<br/> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Inspiration behind the Film </h3>
<p>Dr. Lacy Frazer describes in her own words the inspiration for this film and the progress made thus far toward bringing this vision to life.<br/> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Goals Of This Film Are To:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>EDUCATE TO EMPOWER</strong> - <u>Teach</u> people the skills needed to move from viewing and experiencing themselves as a victim of life to viewing and experiencing themselves as the creator of their life</p>
<p><strong>ILLUSTRATE TO LIBERATE</strong> - <u>Show</u> people a pathway to freedom by telling the stories of others who have successfully dismantled their limiting beliefs, removed the armor, embraced change within, and chose a new positive and sustainable perspective to set themselves free  </p>
<p><strong>ELEVATE TO INSPIRE</strong> - <u>Raise</u> self awareness and instill a sense of confidence that change is not only possible ~ but it is visible and accessible to anyone </p>
<p><strong>ACTIVATE TO MOTIVATE</strong> - <u>Engage</u> and ignite the interest of audiences worldwide to consider and embrace individual and collective change at a time that our world needs hope, healing, integration, collaboration, and new solutions to age-old problems of lack, limitation, and suffering  </p>

<ul>
<li>2.3 million people are confined in jails and prisons around the country (prisonpolicy.org)</li>
<li>The average American household carries an average debt of $137,000 (debt.org)</li>
<li>19.7 million people battle addiction</li>
<li>50% of marriages end in divorce</li>
<li>1 in 5 people experience mental health challenges  </li>
<li>45% of people have a chronic disease<br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>Millions of people suffer from feelings of lack, limitation, being trapped, or a belief that there is no way out of their situation. Many are conditioned to feel like a victim of life circumstances and are focused on surviving rather than thriving. It is these limiting beliefs that not only prevent people from creating a better life for themselves, but that keep them stuck in negative life circumstances.</p>
<p>This film and the ensuing Freeing An Incarcerated World movement will inspire and teach a pathway out of limiting beliefs and conditions of personal incarceration and “no way out” thinking through sharing the stories of people who have been in rock bottom places and who found a pathway out of their literal incarceration by freeing themselves from themselves to lead an empowered, happy, and meaningful life.</p>
<h3>
<br/>A 4-Tiered Plan:</h3>
<p><br/><strong><i>This film is part of a 4-tiered plan and vision to change the culture of incarcerated thinking as well as the culture of prison reentry in our world today. </i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tier 1:</strong> Produce a <strong>Documentary Film</strong>  (Freeing An Incarcerated World) that illustrates the journey of personal transformation through the lives of men and women who were incarcerated, or whose lives were impacted by a loved one's incarceration, and who succeeded in transforming their lives. </p>
<p><strong>Tier 2:</strong> Create an <strong>Online Membership Platform</strong> that provides guidance, inspiration, and support for those reentering society from prison in the form of online classes, video lessons, interviews, handouts, resources lists, live webinars, on-demand motivational material, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Tier 3</strong>: Build a brick and mortar <strong>Reentry Academy </strong>dedicated to providing courses and programs that empower returning citizens to create a new life. These programs are profoundly transformative as they are designed to catalyze transformation from the inside out through a coaching skills model. </p>
<p><strong>Tier 4</strong>: Create a <strong>Reentry Coaching Certification Program </strong>that is designed to train those who work with men and women transitioning back into society from prison, through an empowering coaching skills based model.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction By Lacy 
For 21 years, I witnessed men leave prison not only ill-prepared to reenter society and their lives, but some were worse off than when they went into prison. Some had become better criminals, some had become more entrenched in a victim mentality, and some were angrier than ever before. 
And we ask ourselves, why are our recidivism rates so high? 
In short, men and women who are sentenced to prison, are often sentenced with an underlying societal assumption that going to prison is the “punishment they deserve” for crimes committed and that their experience in prison will serve as a deterrent from committing future crimes. Clearly, the statistics show that one’s prison experience lacks the power to effectively change the underlying thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that motivate repeat criminal acts. 
I believe the answer lies in offering self-help programs, empowerment programs, and/or programs that get to the root of human behavior, the heart of personal change, and the keys to long term transformation. I also believe that a solid reentry approach would include these types of programming both inside and outside of prison that would work together to ensure a smooth transition back into society and set a returning citizen up for success.
Following my own traumatic life experience that required a new skill set and shift in perspective, I developed an innovative, holistic, and transformational self-help program for offenders releasing from federal prison.  This program was based in my belief that all people have innate value and talent, the ability to acquire a new skill set to change their lives, and the ability to shift their perspective to transform their lives. 
Upon my retirement from the Federal Prison System, I reconnected with over 50% of the former participants in my program.  It was clear through the conversations with these men and their families that a different approach to self-help and self-empowerment classes prior to their release had a significant positive impact on their successful reentry back into their lives and into society. 
In this process of witnessing and hearing their stories of reentry and reunification, I knew that there was a powerful story to tell the world. The story is not just about those incarcerated in a physical prison, but a story that includes the realization that many people feel imprisoned in their own every day lives. 
Freeing An Incarcerated World is a story and a movement to help us all to Free Ourselves From Ourselves.   
Overview of the Film
Freeing An Incarcerated World is a documentary film that ignites hope, inspiration, motivation, and a profound sense of positive possibility and freedom in all who see it.
Former federal prison psychologist, Dr. Lacy Frazer, is joined by John Milisitz and several other courageous men that share their stories of personal transformation while in one of the darkest of places, prison.  The viewer not only bears witness to the journey from incarceration to freedom, but is challenged to look at their own personal imprisonment in its myriad of forms.  
Change is Inevitable, but Transformation is a Choice.  
Every man or woman who goes to prison changes in one way or another . . . but only a few use the time to truly transform.  The stories of these men and women provide real life examples of the Journey of Personal Transformation and offer an illustrative map for others to follow who have ever felt trapped, stuck, limited, or imprisoned themselves. 

The Inspiration behind the Film 
Dr. Lacy Frazer describes in her own words the inspiration for this film and the progress made thus far toward bringing this vision to life. 

 
The Goals Of This Film Are To:
 
EDUCATE TO EMPOWER - Teach people the skills needed to move from viewing and experiencing themselves as a victim of life to viewing and experiencing themselves as the creator of their life
ILLUSTRATE TO LIBERATE - Show people a pathway to freedom by telling the stories of others who have successfully dismantled their limiting beliefs, removed the armor, embraced change within, and chose a new positive and sustainable perspective to set themselves free  
ELEVATE TO INSPIRE - Raise self awareness and instill a sense of confidence that change is not only possible ~ but it is visible and accessible to anyone 
ACTIVATE TO MOTIVATE - Engage and ignite the interest of audiences worldwide to consider and embrace individual and collective change at a time that our world needs hope, healing, integration, collaboration, and new solutions to age-old problems of lack, limitation, and suffering  
 
The Impact & The Impetus for the Larger Movement

2.3 million people are confined in jails and prisons around the country (prisonpolicy.org)
The average American household carries an average debt of $137,000 (debt.org)
19.7 million people battle addiction
50% of marriages end in divorce
1 in 5 people experience mental health challenges  
45% of people have a chronic disease 

Millions of people suffer from feelings of lack, limitation, being trapped, or a belief that there is no way out of their situation. Many are conditioned to feel like a victim of life circumstances and are focused on surviving rather than thriving. It is these limiting beliefs that not only prevent people from creating a better life for themselves, but that keep them stuck in negative life circumstances.
This film and the ensuing Freeing An Incarcerated World movement will inspire and teach a pathway out of limiting beliefs and conditions of personal incarceration and “no way out” thinking through sharing the stories of people who have been in rock bottom places and who found a pathway out of their literal incarceration by freeing themselves from themselves to lead an empowered, happy, and meaningful life.

A 4-Tiered Plan:
This film is part of a 4-tiered plan and vision to change the culture of incarcerated thinking as well as the culture of prison reentry in our world today. 
Tier 1: Produce a Documentary Film  (Freeing An Incarcerated World) that illustrates the journey of personal transformation through the lives of men and women who were incarcerated, or whose lives were impacted by a loved one's incarceration, and who succeeded in transforming their lives. 
Tier 2: Create an Online Membership Platform that provides guidance, inspiration, and support for those reentering society from prison in the form of online classes, video lessons, interviews, handouts, resources lists, live webinars, on-demand motivational material, etc. 
Tier 3: Build a brick and mortar Reentry Academy dedicated to providing courses and programs that empower returning citizens to create a new life. These programs are profoundly transformative as they are designed to catalyze transformation from the inside out through a coaching skills model. 
Tier 4: Create a Reentry Coaching Certification Program that is designed to train those who work with men and women transitioning back into society from prison, through an empowering coaching skills based model.

These can include the common cold, the flu, strep throat, and even nasty stomach bugs. Let’s face it, whatever comes home with your child will often spread to one or more members of the household. This can result in missed days of school, work, and even lost wages that impact the entire family. Although most children do wash their hands, they don’t always do it the right way every time: They don't use soap, they don't scrub well or long enough, or they only wash their fingertips.  This product aims to change these statistics by using an amusing and educational book to teach children how, when, and why it’s important to wash their hands and by using visual and audio cues in an interactive soap dispenser to engage their interest and offer a reward for a job well done.  The Foam Gnome system will give them the confidence and independence to wash correctly every time.</p><h3><strong>Who I am:</strong></h3><p>I'm an infectious disease scientist and mother of two. I noticed that even though I had taught my kids how to properly wash their hands, they would still cut corners and not wash the right way when they weren’t being watched. This lead to them catching and spreading germs to each other and me! I started to think about what motivates children to do a good job and realized that coupling repetition with a sense of independence was a huge driving factor.  The Foam Gnome system was born from my deep-rooted desire to help children stay healthy and to give parents a much needed break from constant monitoring.</p><h3><strong>What we need, why we need it, and how you can help us:</strong></h3><p>In order to get this product to you, we need your help. In its current state, the prototype is 3D printed and clipped around an off-the-shelf bottle. We’d like you to be able to use any type of foaming soap that you choose, so we need to create a refillable chamber of our own design inside the dispenser. We also need to make a few electrical changes like designing a custom printed circuit board and adding an integrated battery compartment. In order to do this, we need funding to help cover the cost of these changes. Once those changes are made, we’ll need to pay for tooling for parts that will allow us to use injection molding for factory production. This will speed up production and make a much nicer and more durable dispenser. Your support will also allow us to pay to create packaging for the system.</p><p>This is a unique opportunity to help fund a product that will impact your health and the health of your loved ones. Please consider backing and sharing this project and together we can make the world a cleaner place!</p><h3><strong>Risks and challenges:</strong></h3><p>We are hopeful that everything will continue to run smoothly. Quotes are in place for all of the engineering and packaging design that we need and we have a manufacturer lined up to begin tooling and producing as soon as the redesign is complete. As with anything, these things take time. Although we do not expect any delays or issues, sometimes life happens. The funds are not immediately released once the campaign is over and typically take 2-3 weeks to become available for our use. Once the engineering begins, we’ll need to address any minor issues that develop during the redesign process for the soap chamber and electrical components. There may be a lead time from the manufacturer, too. We will be diligent in keeping you updated with all of our progress!</p><h3><strong>Long-term goals:</strong></h3><p>The Foam Gnome system can be a tremendous aid to child care centers who are seeking to obtain or maintain state accreditation for their facilities.  Getting children excited about washing their hands can be critical to meeting and exceeding state criteria. Accreditation can let parents know that their child is attending a facility that goes the extra mile to keep their students safe and healthy.  </p><p>The Foam Gnome can also be implemented in pediatricians’ offices, urgent care facilities, and hospitals. There the book can remain in the lobby and the dispenser will stay in the restroom for use. This can help lower cross-contamination between sick patients and those who are there for check-ups or injuries. Eventually, we would like to develop a wall mounted unit for use in these facilities where counter top space may be limited.</p><p>Additionally, we intend to offer a system in other languages to include Spanish and French.</p></div>","The CDC and WHO recommend 20 seconds of scrubbing to help ward off viral diseases like the seasonal flu, and other nasty germs.  This system helps teach kiddos how, when, and why to wash their hands in a way that is both fun and effective!  Let us help protect your family the right way! What is it?The Foam Gnome system is a combination of an educational book and an interactive soap dispenser designed for preschool-aged children.  The cute story and illustrations teach kids the basics of keeping clean and why it's important to get rid of germs that can make them (and their parents!) sick.

We’d like you to be able to use any type of foaming soap that you choose, so we need to create a refillable chamber of our own design inside the dispenser. We also need to make a few electrical changes like designing a custom printed circuit board and adding an integrated battery compartment. In order to do this, we need funding to help cover the cost of these changes. Once those changes are made, we’ll need to pay for tooling for parts that will allow us to use injection molding for factory production. This will speed up production and make a much nicer and more durable dispenser. Your support will also allow us to pay to create packaging for the system.This is a unique opportunity to help fund a product that will impact your health and the health of your loved ones. Please consider backing and sharing this project and together we can make the world a cleaner place!Risks and challenges:We are hopeful that everything will continue to run smoothly. Quotes are in place for all of the engineering and packaging design that we need and we have a manufacturer lined up to begin tooling and producing as soon as the redesign is complete. As with anything, these things take time. Although we do not expect any delays or issues, sometimes life happens. The funds are not immediately released once the campaign is over and typically take 2-3 weeks to become available for our use. Once the engineering begins, we’ll need to address any minor issues that develop during the redesign process for the soap chamber and electrical components. There may be a lead time from the manufacturer, too. We will be diligent in keeping you updated with all of our progress!Long-term goals:The Foam Gnome system can be a tremendous aid to child care centers who are seeking to obtain or maintain state accreditation for their facilities.  Getting children excited about washing their hands can be critical to meeting and exceeding state criteria. Accreditation can let parents know that their child is attending a facility that goes the extra mile to keep their students safe and healthy.  The Foam Gnome can also be implemented in pediatricians’ offices, urgent care facilities, and hospitals. There the book can remain in the lobby and the dispenser will stay in the restroom for use. This can help lower cross-contamination between sick patients and those who are there for check-ups or injuries. Eventually, we would like to develop a wall mounted unit for use in these facilities where counter top space may be limited.Additionally, we intend to offer a system in other languages to include Spanish and French.",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Ana Castillo and studied MSc in Genomic Medicine at the University of Manchester, UK. Currently, I am a lecturer at the Undergraduate Level at Mexico City. I love teaching and promoting science education in my country. I was invited to participate in an event to support the inclusion of young girls in Science and Technology. The attendees, who will be coming from many parts of Mexico, including Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Veracruz, are interested in a  career focused on these fields. However, they are at risk of declining this future due to lack of family support and insecurity.  With your contribution, you will change the life of a young girl! Indeed, a book is a door-opening for ideas, knowledge, and inspiration! Help me to give them a science book!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Science books are usually expensive. Even so, the access to this kind of books is limited, including availability and language translation. Therefore I am looking to 1,600$ to cover broadly: </p>
<p>a) Costs of 80 books (Including copies of the Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot, [around MXN 260/per copy]). <br/>b) Shipping Cost (From Spain to Mexico due to Spanish translation). <br/>c) Customs clearance and Indiegogo fee (5%)</p>
<p>Finally, on the day of the meeting, I will give a copy to each girl, just at the end of my participation, which is a workshop to isolate genetic material. Contribute to this cause, and you will make happy a girl! I will take a lot of pictures at the moment the attendees are receiving the book! We will be grateful to you. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Mexico still experiences inequality problems, and usually, men have significantly more opportunities than women. Furthermore, if you look closely at a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) class, you will see only two women per ten students on average! <br/>Most of the cases, Mexican women are hindered to continue with undergraduate and postgraduate studies due to discrimination from male family members and lack of knowledge about how to get immersed in a scientific career. </p>
<p>With your help, you will be able to improve this current panorama by enhancing the education of 80 girls who are about to start their Undergraduate studies (a tough decision to make). The books, such as ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks"" were carefully selected to provide an amiable reading, broaden knowledge and motivate potentially female researchers! </p>
<p>Though the event will support a relatively small number of students (which applied to be at the meeting), its relevance will be extremely significative, since you will be changing 80 crucial decisions that will affect the lives of these bright girls! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A significant risk this project presents is that the books do not arrive on time, specifically on the day of the event. To overcome this hurdle, I am prepared to make the order almost a month and a half before the meeting. <br/>In case of failure, the books will be sent to each girl's house. Alternatively, they will have the option to pick it up at the Institute where the meeting will take place (Puebla, Mexico City). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Give a book! If you have a book that you would like to donate to this cause, please get in touch! The only requirements are that the book must be related to Science, be easy reading and in Spanish. </p>

Thanks! Introducing ConfiBoost: Smart Eyewear that is designed to help students naturally strengthen attention and focus skills that are sustained after training. When the user loses focus, the lenses will occlude. The safe sensor rests on the forehead and monitors brain signal activity, looking for indicators of declining focus. When loss of concentration is detected the lenses darken for 2 seconds, this visual reminder nudges the student to pay attention while reading  and can have long-lasting results after a period of sustained training.  The ConfiBoost  neurocognitive training system is an affordable, safe, long-lasting, and effective solution to address attention deficits, learning challenges and reading gaps in US schools. Safe and effective neurocognitive training can  improve attentiveness over time and those gains can be sustained. See peer-reviewed research studies below. These kids deserve a boost!

 ""The last 4 years I've been on a mission to bring science, the scientific method and creativity and critical reasoning to the epidemic of attention-challenges that affect our schools. We have been successful in putting together a world-class team of teachers, neuroscientists, neurofeedback practitioners, engineers and marketers to construct an innovative patented solution we think will make a difference in the lives of many young people and equip them for fulfilling lives.""                                                      -Rod Greder, Founder & CEO of Awear TechnologiesPlease watch the following video to hear about what drove us to develop ConfiBoost eyewear to help kids struggling with attention challenges.

 
Students with ADHD and other attention challenges often fall behind in the classroom. We've designed ConfiBoost to change that by targeting the source of attention issues. Other interventions, like psychostimulants, lessen the symptoms for a period of time. Our smart eyewear helps retrain the brain by reminding students when their mind wanders and helps them be more self-aware that they need to refocus.
This self awareness helps strengthen their attention skills and this self control can be maintained.Without attention there is no learning. No encoding, storage or retrieval. It is as simple as that! Is there science and data behind the product?Peer-reviewed studies have shown that neurocognitive training done in schools is effective and the results are maintained at least six months. [Steiner, N. J., Frenette, E. C., Rene K. M., Brennan, R. T., & Perrin, E. C. (2014). In-school neurofeedback training for ADHD: Sustained improvements from a randomized control trial.

DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) has tested the use of neurofeedback to improve marksmanship.  https://www.cwilsonmeloncelli.com/490-improveme... NASA has worked with startups to commercialize neurofeedback. https://spinoff.nasa.gov/Spinoff2013/cg_2.html                                    We have data with a small sample of college students. We tested the prototype with eight average to above average students in 2017. We saw changes in reading scores with limited sessions. We need to repeat these trials with more subjects over a longer period of time to confirm results (especially with those struggling to pay attention). We also must begin testing of pre-adolescents which is where we think we can make the greatest impact in improving attention that leads to better learning outcomes like reading. We measured brain signals that have been determined to relate to alertness, attention and focus. We've chosen key brain locations to monitor and we continue to analyze new signal patterns, locations and new hardware to maximize our accuracy in providing feedback.     We  also asked the user to reflect and integrate during the darkening of the lenses. This reflection period has appeared to provide improvements in comprehension scores specifically when reading more difficult material. We are following up on this interesting finding. How big is the need for this product?Roughly 10 million students in elementary schools today could benefit from a cognitive training intervention to improve attention. Watch the following video to hear the stories of students, parents and teachers: Cognitive training helps individuals develop better control over thoughts, actions, and behaviors, including self-control. Parents tend to look toward medication to alleviate ADHD symptoms, but this is not effective for 20-30% of users. When medication does work, it often comes with considerable side effects: nervousness, restlessness, insomnia, headaches, and more. Medications have no lasting results when you stop taking them. EEG-neurofeedback training builds the long-term skills that make it easier to pay attention in the future. Unlike brain training games, the eyewear helps the user develop skills during primary activities-- reading, listening, and studying. ConfiBoost targets the source of attention problems rather than just treating symptoms. Brain training games where you need to pay attention to changes on a screen have a major flaw— they don't readily translate to improved skills or learning capabilities. Although you get better at paying attention to the game, the brain pathways that control attention during reading, studying or listening to a teacher are little changed. Students benefit more from training themselves in real-life situations. How does it work?It only takes one touch of a hot stove for you to learn not to do it. Feedback works! While getting burned is a bit extreme, the feedback needs to be disruptive enough so that you notice and are motivated to change behaviors. ConfiBoost is an EEG device, meaning that it can detect brain electrical activity and follow brain signal patterns. When you lose focus, the lenses will darken, signaling the wearer to focus their attention.  Behavioral science and learning theory show that learning is proportional to stimulus. When a person is too relaxed or too stressed, less learning occurs. ConfiBoost helps students stay at the right level of focus to learn in real-life situations.See the graphic below to understand how the feedback works to get the student's attention, how they personally perceive it and react to it, how their brain is changing as they train and the learning outcomes that are expected. The student will use the eyewear while reading for 10-20 minute sessions several times per week over 6-8 weeks. They are evaluated with comprehension/recall tests after each session. Standardized attention tests are also conducted.Our wearable allows the student to work on strengthening attentional pathways while doing the task they want to improve. Neuropathways are most flexible in younger years, so school-aged kids can benefit the most from ConfiBoost. Staying focused actually becomes easier over time because students gradually build their attention skills and confidence. Watch video to see real-time operation of the dashboard. Re-watch end of student and parents video above to see operation of glasses paired with the dashboard. Glasses occluding when mind-wandering (above the threshold) and glasses clearing when focusing (below the threshold). The glasses are clear enough to not obstruct reading even though still tinted.

 

  There are other EEG devices in the market, but ConfiBoost  is the only one that gives the wearer disruptive, visual feedback that literally and figuratively gets their attention.  Has the technology been reviewed and supported?Awear Technologies has received grants from several government funding agencies in the past: NIH (National Institute of Health), NSF (National Science Foundation) and the Department of Education. This funding has gone towards ConfiBoost prototype development and early pilot studies.               Has the product gained awareness and been recognized?Awear has received awards for its product! We were honored as a Visionary Finalist in the Intel Make it Wearable Challenge in 2014.

He faced numerous challenges as a young man struggling with dyslexia because he didn’t have the resources to help him understand his unique learning difference. Through Derrick's experience of raising three sons, coaching basketball teams and spending thousands of hours trying to find the right educational resources for them, he developed a system of recommendations that helped his sons and his players to better understand their strengths and weaknesses in order to build and hone their skills. This gave them a deeper understanding of themselves which empowered them to learn, grow, and succeed.

<b>Baatonum</b> is the language of the Baatonu people of Northern Benin, but also of parts of Nigeria, Togo and Ivory Coast. It is the native language of close to 600'000 people. <br/><br/>Our project consists in the creation of the <b>first free electronic dictionary</b> <b>in Baatonum</b> that will be freely accessible to all. Our goal is to create 50'000 word forms, and to link them to all 100+ other languages that we have been developing so far in our System.<br/><br/><b>Electronic dictionaries are essential tools for:</b><br/><ul>
<li>Supporting the learning of languages in schools and for advanced studies in universities</li>
<li>Encouraging native speakers to use their language for sharing their cultural heritage<br/>
</li>
<li>Promoting the usage and diffusion of languages in society and on the Internet<br/>
</li>
<li>Helping the cultural and linguistic preservation of languages</li>
</ul>
<p>By creating this unprecedented dictionary, the Baatonum language will be available among the many other so called ""<b>minority languages</b>"", for which we have already created similar resources, such as: Telugu, Punjabi, Sinhala (India); Bambara, Afrikaans, Berber (Africa); or Azerbaijani, Georgian and Armenian (Central Asia).<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why Baatonum?</b></p>
<p>Baatonum is a very peculiar tone language not closely related to any other language, and which has been claimed to present <b>a challenge</b> to several assumptions in Linguistics. </p>
<p>Additionally, Baatonum is one of the hundreds of languages in the world for which there are <b>very few resources available</b>. As many other languages in developing Africa, it has been facing more and more the risk of being neglected and of being replaced by other major trade or ex-colonial languages. While this multilingual openness is an asset for many people, we also believe that native languages define every person's own culture, vision and way of thinking and, therefore, should be preserved. </p>
<p><b>What is supposed to be done?</b></p>
<p>Our project aims at integrating <b>50'000 word forms</b> from Baatonum into MUHIT, the MUltilingual Harmonized DicTionary, available at <a href=""http://www.unlweb.net/muhit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">unlweb.net/muhit</a>.</p>

It is also the most diversified dictionary in the world, for it contains entries in <b>124 languages</b>, among which many less-resourced languages, such as Romansh, Kabyle, Nahuatl, Shona and Wolof, for which, in some cases, we have created the first and largest free online dictionaries currently available.</p>

This is the UNLarium (available at <a href=""http://www.unlweb.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.unlweb.net</a>), which was launched in 2010 and has been successfully used for the past five years to interlink languages from all over the world through a <b>collaborative free open environment</b>. <p></p>
<p>The whole work is carried out by a community currently consisting of <b>2,000 language experts</b>, who have been constantly expanding, evolving and improving our lexical databases. After pursuing the necessary certificates in our virtual learning environment, developers work in their mother tongue, from home, either as partners, as volunteers or as freelancers.</p>
<p>The whole work is <b>supervised</b> from the UNDL Foundation office in Geneva, which is responsible for setting the standards, controlling the quality of the work and integrating the entries in a huge network of language and knowledge.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What are the benefits of this initiative?</b></p>
<p>As a result of the current project, the following benefits are expected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Baatonum will be linked to several other languages at the lexical level through MUHIT</li>
<li>Concepts that are specific to the Bariba culture will be identified, stored and preserved</li>
<li>The knowledge about Baatonum lexicography will be expanded</li>
<li>Local people in Benin will be trained in Computational Linguistics, one of today's most demanding scientific fields</li>
</ul>
<p>And we ought to observe that all resources developed under this project will be released under a <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License</a> (i.e., for free), so that the whole community of researchers and users will be able to use them.</p>
<p><b>How the money will be used?</b></p>
<p>With 30'000 US$ we will cover the following expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding and gathering a team of local language experts</li>
<li>Training the linguistic team in creating the dictionary entries</li>
<li>Remunerating the team for creating up to 50'000 word forms in Baatonum</li>
<li>Integrating these new words into MUHIT and, therefore, linking them to the other available languages</li>
</ul>
<p>Any additional funds will be directly invested in the creation of more words of the Baatonum dictionary. </p>

Our project aims at integrating 50'000 word forms from Baatonum into MUHIT, the MUltilingual Harmonized DicTionary, available at unlweb.net/muhit.
MUHIT is a free online harmonized dictionary where word forms from all languages are interlinked by sense indexes, which enable advanced multilingual and cross-cultural searches: synonyms, homonyms, language specific expressions, intercultural equivalences and varieties, etc. It is already one of the largest multilingual dictionaries in the world, containing more than 20 million entries, which have been created by our community. It is also the most diversified dictionary in the world, for it contains entries in 124 languages, among which many less-resourced languages, such as Romansh, Kabyle, Nahuatl, Shona and Wolof, for which, in some cases, we have created the first and largest free online dictionaries currently available.
How would you achieve this?
We have already a very complete framework for developing language resources. This is the UNLarium (available at www.unlweb.net), which was launched in 2010 and has been successfully used for the past five years to interlink languages from all over the world through a collaborative free open environment. 
The whole work is carried out by a community currently consisting of 2,000 language experts, who have been constantly expanding, evolving and improving our lexical databases. After pursuing the necessary certificates in our virtual learning environment, developers work in their mother tongue, from home, either as partners, as volunteers or as freelancers.
The whole work is supervised from the UNDL Foundation office in Geneva, which is responsible for setting the standards, controlling the quality of the work and integrating the entries in a huge network of language and knowledge.

What are the benefits of this initiative?
As a result of the current project, the following benefits are expected:

Baatonum will be linked to several other languages at the lexical level through MUHIT
Concepts that are specific to the Bariba culture will be identified, stored and preserved
The knowledge about Baatonum lexicography will be expanded
Local people in Benin will be trained in Computational Linguistics, one of today's most demanding scientific fields

And we ought to observe that all resources developed under this project will be released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License (i.e., for free), so that the whole community of researchers and users will be able to use them.
How the money will be used?
With 30'000 US$ we will cover the following expenses:

Finding and gathering a team of local language experts
Training the linguistic team in creating the dictionary entries
Remunerating the team for creating up to 50'000 word forms in Baatonum
Integrating these new words into MUHIT and, therefore, linking them to the other available languages

Any additional funds will be directly invested in the creation of more words of the Baatonum dictionary. 
Who are you?

The UNDL Foundation is a non-profit R&D organization, based in Geneva, Switzerland, entirely dedicated to create free multilingual resources with the aim of facilitating communication among all peoples and nations. Our main mission is to preserve cultural diversity and share knowledge by:


Creating resources for all languages, which are released for free


Treating minority and local languages at the same level as any major language


Sharing the knowledge embedded in all languages


Providing tools for each language to participate in a sustainable globalization

AthensHoplites, part of the KORYVANTES Association, are a dedicated swordsmanship Society, an non-profit Organisation, focused in studying and practicing the war arts of the heavily armoured Warriors of the Hellenic Worlds.  Our expertise dates back to 2008, when KORYVANTES Association initiated their Academically accredited work in historically accurate Phalanx formations and Classical-era armours.
Focus will be on reviving and practising Mycenean, Archaic and Classical era war arts.

We are starting a new initiative in the form of a Swordsmanship Academy in Downtown Athens, for which we need to fund expensive and specialised HEMA-style and non-commercially available training equipment.

the Community to the Commonwealth.

Hello, I’m Nick. I’m a passionate community advocate and proud idealist.
Growing up in Ottawa my whole life I've witnessed what can happen when you
stand up for your beliefs and take action. 

That's why I’ve been selected to be a Canadian Delegate at the 33Sixty
Leadership Programme in Malta. There, I will be meeting with refugees,
non-profit organization and youth from across the Commonwealth to share
knowledge and solve problems affecting individuals most in need. Now more than
ever, youth must be part of the conversation on sustainable and equitable
migration in the global village. This is why this programme is so dear to me.

With your support, you can ensure Canadian youth have a voice in this important
dialogue while helping to cultivate young leaders in our community. Going
the Distance.
Having the chance to represent both my country and
city among youth from across the Commonwealth is privilege I do not take
lightly. However with this responsibility, comes challenges.
As an international summit, the expenses associated with this experience can be
high. That’s why I am looking for financial support to be able to attend on
behalf of my community. Simply put, I am looking to raise 1000$ to pay for
airfare to and from Malta.
As a sign of my sincere gratitude for your support, I would be happy to
recognize you as a community leader within my social media as well as the
Common Purpose Alumni Network (over 50,000 people around the world)!

We recently received an invitation we could not refuse, to make a thematic exhibition we’ve called <strong>‘Remake - We Make’</strong> to be part of the 2015 Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism and Architecture (Shenzhen) – UABB (SZ)* the prestigious international cultural event taking place this winter in the city of Shenzhen, in China's Pearl River Delta. The Biennale, including our exhibition, opens to the public on 5 Dec 2015, and the last day for public viewing is 28 Feb 2016. You will be able to find '<b>Remake - We Make</b>' in the collateral section of the event, at its main venue, a converted flour factory at its site in Shekou, Shenzhen.</p><p>Taking ‘Re-Living the City’ as its theme, the Biennale asks in what ways a future vision for the city and its Pearl River Delta region can be humanistic.

Instead of urban development plans - usually abstract in nature - the Biennale looks at how people are actually living in the city, and shows projects that ‘re-live’ the city by reinventing what exists through reuse and rethinking of existing buildings and urban spaces. The Biennale takes the Chinese concept of ‘cheng shi yuan dian’ (which means ‘thinking about change’), and shows local and international proposals actively responding to people’s lived experiences and to existing settings, inventing improvements for streets, parks, buildings and small insertions into specific public spaces.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What Re Make – We Make includes:</strong></p><p>To respond to the Biennale’s theme and play a role as part of the event, we’re raising money to create <strong>‘Remake – We Make’</strong>, our exhibition in two parts:</p><p>A collaboration with the talented young UK-Norwegian team, WORKSHOP architecture founded by Clementine Blakemore, Alexander Furunes and Ivar Tutturen who will lead a participative design-build process to make a multi-use structure in local recycled timber, together with students from University of Shenzhen with Professor Xian Guo, Professor, and Professor Yan Gao, University       <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">of Hong Kong.

Film director Paul McHale created six short documentary films giving a wider public an insight into the priorities and challenges calling for innovative solutions, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The 'Remake – We Make' team</strong></p><p><strong>Lucy Bullivant</strong> PhD Hon FRIBA is a leading curator of exhibitions and events about innovation in architecture and urban design, the founder of the Urbanista.org website devoted to liveable urbanism, and an advisor to many international bodies and firms. She is the author of many successful books including Masterplanning Futures, on adaptive planning (2012), winner of Book of the Year at the Urban Design Group Awards, 2014, and Recoded City: Co-creating urban futures, on participatory placemaking, co-authored with Thomas Ermacora (2015). Her groundbreaking and popular exhibitions include ‘Space Invaders’, about the work of young UK architects, co-curated with Pedro Gadanho, for the British Council and ‘The near and the far, fixed and in flux’, the British Pavilion for the XIX Milan Triennale.</p><p><strong>WORKSHOP architecture</strong> (Clementine Blakemore, Alexander Furunes and Ivar Tutturen) creates buildings that are modest, practical and meaningful, forming a team of collaborators and partners for each project, and producing associated books and exhibitions in order to open the conversation to a wider audience. WORKSHOP has worked with the local community to make new schools buildings after disaster in Tachloban, the Philippines, for example – and in other neighbourhoods such as at Chandar Nagar in India, living at subsistence level, and urban and rural contexts. Blakemore was the Visionary Processes category winner at the 2015 SustainRCA Awards.</p><p><strong>Paul McHale</strong>, a film director and editor based in Birmingham, UK, has made documentaries, animations and short films for businesses and cultural organisations including Birmingham Museums, Fused magazine, the Soul Food Project, and Roca London Gallery.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Links for further information about our team:</strong></p><p>Urbanista.org - webzine dedicated to liveable urbanism founded by Lucy Bullivant: <a href=""http://www.urbanista.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.urbanista.org</a></p><p>Urbanistas: women innovators in architecture, urban and landscape design - exhibition, documentary films:</p><p><a href=""http://urbanistas.roca-exhibitions.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://urbanistas.roca-exhibitions.co.uk</a></p><p>WORKSHOP architecture (WSa): <a href=""http://wrkshp.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://wrkshp.org</a></p><p>Paul McGrath - documentary film maker: <a href=""http://olddeadeye.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://olddeadeye.com</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>How our exhibition complements the Biennale:</strong></p><p>As there is no UK pavilion at the Biennale as official national projects of this kind need much longer to set up, the films will shed light on some exceptional UK projects at the Biennale alongside more than 60 projects by leading practices committed to architecture’s social role, including Future Cities Laboratory (Switzerland), Juan Du (Hong Kong), standardarchitecture and MAD Office (China), Rural Urban Framework (Hong Kong, co-founded by Joshua Bolshover from the UK), standardarchitecture (China), Anna Heringer (Germany), Hitoshi Abe (Japan), Teddy Cruz/Fonna Forman (Mexico), Ecosistema Urbano (Spain), Crimson (NL) and Interboro (US). In line with the Biennale’s theme, our small adaptable structure by WORKSHOP architecture will show how a young UK-Norwegian team makes best use of local resources and collaborators.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Summing up:</strong></p><p><strong>'Remake – We Make’</strong> highlights the reality that architecture is a participative process. Its focus is on interactive placemaking, overcoming the typical disconnection between the public and the customary processes by which places are being made today. Our message is that new models of resident and community-engaged placemaking represent examples of alternative ways of making the city. These foster collaborative processes and the deployment of local materials, crafts and skills to build social, educational and ecological capital in places where they are urgently needed.</p><p>The team has started work on the exhibition but we need you to help in order to enable all the aspects of this exhibition to become a reality and to reach our target goal financially. We have a short space of time in which to fully meet this unique opportunity to celebrate and document these architects. For that, we need your help. Thank you for supporting us!</p><p> </p><p><strong>What we need &amp; What you will get:</strong></p><p>The funds raised will enable two members of the team to travel from Europe to Shenzhen to work on-site, building the structure with the local students from University of Shenzhen. It will fund the costs of the affordable local materials and equipment they will use. It will enable Paul McHale, our film director, to create short documentary films using existing footage of projects. Funding will be divided between local materials, including information display vinyls, and projection equipment; travel/accommodation while on site; preparation of the film; organisational costs.</p><p>Even if you don’t have the opportunity to see the Biennale, the completed <strong>‘Remake – We Make’</strong> films will be accessible on the Urbanista.org website, on its Facebook page, and on Vimeo.com.</p><p> </p><p><b>Perks/rewards</b></p><p>The main reward for backing <strong>‘ReMake – We Make’</strong> is that you’ll receive a copy of the Shenzhen Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism catalogue, featuring all the selected international exhibitors.

Not only will the films will be available for viewing on the Urbanista.org webzine and Vimeo.com, but the structure made by WORKSHOP architecture and the University of Shenzhen student team we hope to donate to a community organization in Shenzhen. Following our earlier urban innovation project…‘Remake – We Make’ comes on the heels of the hugely successful exhibition, ‘Urbanistas: women innovators in architecture, urban and landscape architecture’, curated by Lucy Bullivant commissioned by Roca London Gallery and staged there in London and at the Core, Science Central, in Newcastle with Northern Architecture, Igloo Regeneration and Creative Space Management.Through films, models, photographs and drawings by architects Alison Brooks, Irena Bauman, Muf (Liza Fior and Katherine Clarke), Alessandra Cianchetta (of AWP) and Johanna Gibbons (J&L Gibbons), Urbanistas promoted an alternative response to the needs of the urban environment through a comprehensive, holistic approach to planning and customized design of housing at locations including London’s suburbs, Ouseburn in east Newcastle, Holbeck in Leeds, La Défense, the business district in Paris and by the river Avon in Bath. Film director Paul McHale created six short documentary films giving a wider public an insight into the priorities and challenges calling for innovative solutions, to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. The 'Remake – We Make' teamLucy Bullivant PhD Hon FRIBA is a leading curator of exhibitions and events about innovation in architecture and urban design, the founder of the Urbanista.org website devoted to liveable urbanism, and an advisor to many international bodies and firms. She is the author of many successful books including Masterplanning Futures, on adaptive planning (2012), winner of Book of the Year at the Urban Design Group Awards, 2014, and Recoded City: Co-creating urban futures, on participatory placemaking, co-authored with Thomas Ermacora (2015). Her groundbreaking and popular exhibitions include ‘Space Invaders’, about the work of young UK architects, co-curated with Pedro Gadanho, for the British Council and ‘The near and the far, fixed and in flux’, the British Pavilion for the XIX Milan Triennale.WORKSHOP architecture (Clementine Blakemore, Alexander Furunes and Ivar Tutturen) creates buildings that are modest, practical and meaningful, forming a team of collaborators and partners for each project, and producing associated books and exhibitions in order to open the conversation to a wider audience. WORKSHOP has worked with the local community to make new schools buildings after disaster in Tachloban, the Philippines, for example – and in other neighbourhoods such as at Chandar Nagar in India, living at subsistence level, and urban and rural contexts. Blakemore was the Visionary Processes category winner at the 2015 SustainRCA Awards.Paul McHale, a film director and editor based in Birmingham, UK, has made documentaries, animations and short films for businesses and cultural organisations including Birmingham Museums, Fused magazine, the Soul Food Project, and Roca London Gallery. Links for further information about our team:Urbanista.org - webzine dedicated to liveable urbanism founded by Lucy Bullivant: http://www.urbanista.orgUrbanistas: women innovators in architecture, urban and landscape design - exhibition, documentary films:http://urbanistas.roca-exhibitions.co.ukWORKSHOP architecture (WSa): http://wrkshp.orgPaul McGrath - documentary film maker: http://olddeadeye.com How our exhibition complements the Biennale:As there is no UK pavilion at the Biennale as official national projects of this kind need much longer to set up, the films will shed light on some exceptional UK projects at the Biennale alongside more than 60 projects by leading practices committed to architecture’s social role, including Future Cities Laboratory (Switzerland), Juan Du (Hong Kong), standardarchitecture and MAD Office (China), Rural Urban Framework (Hong Kong, co-founded by Joshua Bolshover from the UK), standardarchitecture (China), Anna Heringer (Germany), Hitoshi Abe (Japan), Teddy Cruz/Fonna Forman (Mexico), Ecosistema Urbano (Spain), Crimson (NL) and Interboro (US). In line with the Biennale’s theme, our small adaptable structure by WORKSHOP architecture will show how a young UK-Norwegian team makes best use of local resources and collaborators. Summing up:'Remake – We Make’ highlights the reality that architecture is a participative process. Its focus is on interactive placemaking, overcoming the typical disconnection between the public and the customary processes by which places are being made today. Our message is that new models of resident and community-engaged placemaking represent examples of alternative ways of making the city. These foster collaborative processes and the deployment of local materials, crafts and skills to build social, educational and ecological capital in places where they are urgently needed.The team has started work on the exhibition but we need you to help in order to enable all the aspects of this exhibition to become a reality and to reach our target goal financially. We have a short space of time in which to fully meet this unique opportunity to celebrate and document these architects. For that, we need your help. Thank you for supporting us! What we need & What you will get:The funds raised will enable two members of the team to travel from Europe to Shenzhen to work on-site, building the structure with the local students from University of Shenzhen. It will fund the costs of the affordable local materials and equipment they will use. It will enable Paul McHale, our film director, to create short documentary films using existing footage of projects. Funding will be divided between local materials, including information display vinyls, and projection equipment; travel/accommodation while on site; preparation of the film; organisational costs.Even if you don’t have the opportunity to see the Biennale, the completed ‘Remake – We Make’ films will be accessible on the Urbanista.org website, on its Facebook page, and on Vimeo.com. Perks/rewardsThe main reward for backing ‘ReMake – We Make’ is that you’ll receive a copy of the Shenzhen Biennale of Architecture and Urbanism catalogue, featuring all the selected international exhibitors.

<p>The best way for this generation of college students to understand Israel is to go there. As a faculty member at UMD, I have been taking students to Israel since 2012. When they return, this is what they say:</p>
<p>“This trip enhanced my interest in teaching students from diverse backgrounds.” </p>
<p>""The media reduces and mischaracterizes Israel into something that it is not, that bears little truth to the society I have come to know...vibrant and multicultural.""</p>
<p>“Israel is a country of collaboration.” </p>
<p>“The coexistence of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim people in one of the smallest and fought over countries is in itself something to admire and elicits strong comparisons to how different and how unaccepting other nations can be.""</p>
<p>“Not only am I learning a lot about Israel, I am also learning about my Ethiopian culture and identity. I did not know that Ethiopian Jews even existed. It makes me emotional to learn about the hardships and struggle they had to go through to get to this point. I feel a deep connection with them.” </p>
<p>While student <i>sometimes </i>receive <i>some</i> funding from the university, those funds contribute to the cost of the program but not the airfare, which many first generation college students are unable to afford.</p>
<p>This campaign will help cover airfare for up to 6 students.</p>
<p>Any amount will be appreciated, and helping us to spread the word helps a lot, also!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I want to help anyone who is stuck in a job they hate or on an income that's too low find a new life and new career in a job that pays well and is immensely satisfying. I have been training people for over 7 years, literally starting 100's of careers. I have been building applications and software for over 10 years in a variety of industries and environments. I have truly been learning ever since I left university and figured out who I am and what I am about. Ultimately, I am completely passionate about people living the life they dream of having with the career they love, rather than settling for anything less than that.</p>
<p>I'm building a one of a kind immersive learning experience that will support and guide anyone who wants to in the art of Software Development.</p>
<p>This is for people who:</p>
<ul>
<li>finished school early</li>
<li>were let down by boring lectures at university</li>
<li>got a degree and ended up working behind a checkout, in a call centre, or anywhere else where their skills are wasted</li>
<li>never got on with education at school because, to be frank, it was stale and boring</li>
<li>quite simply, want to change their lives and improve their lot in the world</li>
</ul>
<p>The application I'm building puts the individual and their goals at the absolute centre stage.</p>
<p>It will:</p>
<ul>
<li>deliver completely industry relevant learning</li>
<li>provide real time feedback based upon what a person is doing</li>
<li>give them an immersive experience where they feel supported at all times</li>
<li>provide a platform to build their portfolio of evidence that will wow employers and interviewers</li>
<li>provide structured and progressive learning with regular checkpoints for support and guidance</li>
</ul>
<p>If you support this, you will have given a helping hand that will actually achieve something, you will have helped improve the lot of your fellow human and provided a platform for tapping into all that hidden and lost talent in the world. Who knows what the future holds where everyone is at their happiest and strongest. I know something though, I want to do everything I can to find out what that future looks like and, right now, this is the best way I can think of to add my own contribution to that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Quite simply, I need time. I have the vision, I have the plan of what the first set of modules need to look like and I know how to build the material. The thing I don't have is time. By supporting this campaign you will allow me to devote all of my time to building this. I think I can get the first release done quickly, it's already halfway there at least, and then I think that I can start building out the app further in short iterations thereafter.</p>
<p>The perks I am offering range from a simple heartfelt thank you, various lengths of free subscriptions for varying numbers of people (great if you work for a company looking for the best way to train your apprentices or graduates), right through to having a direct impact on the direction, prioritisation and scope of this product. And for those of you who really want it, you will get my time probably over skype or something similar (in person if you are near me). I will give you the opportunity for direct 1-2-1 training that you will get no where else (this is completely transferable to friends and relatives). Some of these perks will include a variety of different catch ups ranging from every couple of months right through to monthly, if you so wish. I should mention that these kind of perks will be a premium on the site and so are definitely worth hooking into here.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, then any funds I do raise will continue to support my time on this (I just won't have as much time). This project is incredibly close to my heart and I work on it whenever I can in the evenings and at weekends when I'm not working to pay the bills, that will not change.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting this project you are directly helping improve the lives of people around you in a real and tangible way. Improving peoples lives has a direct impact on their loved ones and their family. You will be providing the current/future families of the people using this with more opportunities to thrive in the world. I wonder what amazing things they will then achieve and contribute back to society in the process.</p>
<p>Training is in my blood, and education is the life force of innovation and advancement of our world. I've been helping people start careers for years, and now I want to take this mainstream and open up these opportunities to everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are a series of challenges around finding people to use this application. However I've already found several people who are waiting patiently for me to finish the first version so they can get started on this. I have a plan of trying a variety of different experiments to find the best way of reaching people who will benefit from this. This plan includes building the right network, creating guest articles for different sites, blogs and potentially magazines. This plan also includes a variety of low cost in-person training sessions to help get people started and build their confidence that they can do this</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you love the idea of this but can't provide a financial contribution then there are still things you can do to help make this a success. You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign with people you know and love</li>
<li>Help me in other ways by being part of a beta test (TBA)</li>
<li>Provide me with feedback about what you think works and what you think doesn't work</li>
<li>When the first version is released, you can sign up, change your life, cheer yourself on and let people know how you did it!</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Thanks for reading this and I wish you all the very best for you and your life.</p></div>","Or Simply Put

Completing the Junior Software Developer course means that people can apply for Junior Software Developer jobs with a strong chance of being successful
I measure success by the number of lives I've helped improve and the number of careers I've helped start
Courses are organised by the Job roles and cover enough of each topic to enable a person to do that job

Why?

Having a degree doesn't mean anything these days
Contemporary education is stale
Modern learning platforms lack focus

What's an Immersive Learning Experience?

Completely focused on what is required to start a new career or profession
Practice within the platform while you learn
Get intelligent feedback and suggestions when you start to struggle
Small steps that get you building something tangible fast
Learning assistance bots to guide you each step of the way

Who's it for?

People who want more from life
People who want a chance to show their worth
People who just really want to be developers
People who care about themselves


Short Summary
I want to help anyone who is stuck in a job they hate or on an income that's too low find a new life and new career in a job that pays well and is immensely satisfying. I have been training people for over 7 years, literally starting 100's of careers. I have been building applications and software for over 10 years in a variety of industries and environments. I have truly been learning ever since I left university and figured out who I am and what I am about. Ultimately, I am completely passionate about people living the life they dream of having with the career they love, rather than settling for anything less than that.
I'm building a one of a kind immersive learning experience that will support and guide anyone who wants to in the art of Software Development.
This is for people who:

finished school early
were let down by boring lectures at university
got a degree and ended up working behind a checkout, in a call centre, or anywhere else where their skills are wasted
never got on with education at school because, to be frank, it was stale and boring
quite simply, want to change their lives and improve their lot in the world

The application I'm building puts the individual and their goals at the absolute centre stage.
It will:

deliver completely industry relevant learning
provide real time feedback based upon what a person is doing
give them an immersive experience where they feel supported at all times
provide a platform to build their portfolio of evidence that will wow employers and interviewers
provide structured and progressive learning with regular checkpoints for support and guidance

If you support this, you will have given a helping hand that will actually achieve something, you will have helped improve the lot of your fellow human and provided a platform for tapping into all that hidden and lost talent in the world. Who knows what the future holds where everyone is at their happiest and strongest. I know something though, I want to do everything I can to find out what that future looks like and, right now, this is the best way I can think of to add my own contribution to that.

What I Need & What You Get
Quite simply, I need time. I have the vision, I have the plan of what the first set of modules need to look like and I know how to build the material. The thing I don't have is time. By supporting this campaign you will allow me to devote all of my time to building this. I think I can get the first release done quickly, it's already halfway there at least, and then I think that I can start building out the app further in short iterations thereafter.
The perks I am offering range from a simple heartfelt thank you, various lengths of free subscriptions for varying numbers of people (great if you work for a company looking for the best way to train your apprentices or graduates), right through to having a direct impact on the direction, prioritisation and scope of this product. And for those of you who really want it, you will get my time probably over skype or something similar (in person if you are near me). I will give you the opportunity for direct 1-2-1 training that you will get no where else (this is completely transferable to friends and relatives). Some of these perks will include a variety of different catch ups ranging from every couple of months right through to monthly, if you so wish. I should mention that these kind of perks will be a premium on the site and so are definitely worth hooking into here.
If I don't reach my goal, then any funds I do raise will continue to support my time on this (I just won't have as much time). This project is incredibly close to my heart and I work on it whenever I can in the evenings and at weekends when I'm not working to pay the bills, that will not change.

The Impact
By supporting this project you are directly helping improve the lives of people around you in a real and tangible way. Improving peoples lives has a direct impact on their loved ones and their family. You will be providing the current/future families of the people using this with more opportunities to thrive in the world. I wonder what amazing things they will then achieve and contribute back to society in the process.
Training is in my blood, and education is the life force of innovation and advancement of our world. I've been helping people start careers for years, and now I want to take this mainstream and open up these opportunities to everyone.

Risks & Challenges
There are a series of challenges around finding people to use this application. However I've already found several people who are waiting patiently for me to finish the first version so they can get started on this. I have a plan of trying a variety of different experiments to find the best way of reaching people who will benefit from this. This plan includes building the right network, creating guest articles for different sites, blogs and potentially magazines. This plan also includes a variety of low cost in-person training sessions to help get people started and build their confidence that they can do this

Other Ways You Can Help
If you love the idea of this but can't provide a financial contribution then there are still things you can do to help make this a success. You can:

Share this campaign with people you know and love
Help me in other ways by being part of a beta test (TBA)
Provide me with feedback about what you think works and what you think doesn't work
When the first version is released, you can sign up, change your life, cheer yourself on and let people know how you did it!

Thanks for reading this and I wish you all the very best for you and your life.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I created Young at Arts with the hope of recreating what I learned at my childhood arts school, that art brings people together and the more we learn to express ourselves, the more we see that we are all beautiful and worthy of doing wonderful things for our world and for each other.  Won't you help me bring 24 of our students, picked from our student body of 500, who have worked hard and shown perseverance and leadership, to see and go behind the scenes of a Beyoncé concert, as special guests. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Ask a seasoned world traveler to name their favorite place, and few would probably choose the place closest to my heart: Liberia.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the little that many people know about Liberia usually involves blood diamonds, Charles Taylor and Ebola. My name is Janel Galvanek and I have worked for a peacebuilding institute for the last 8 years, which has given me the incredible opportunity to travel around the world and to see a side of Liberia which doesn’t make headlines. Liberia is a place where people come together to care for each another despite the most difficult conditions and where citizens work for peace on a daily basis.</p>
<p>My love of Liberia started in 2008 when I went to do research on the reintegration of child soldiers. I fell in love with the place, the music, the people, the feel. And I met U-Jay, whom immediately became my brother, my best friend, my bodyguard and someone who drops everything to hang out with me and help me with my research when I am in the country. For me, U-Jay represents the best of Liberia - that in spite of the daily struggles that people have to endure, they can still be honest and kind and do what they can to help other people who are worse off than they are.</p>
<p>On the road to Gbarnga last September 2015 I asked U-Jay what he would do if he had the means to do <i>anything</i> in the world. He l said, ‘If I could do anything in the world, I would buy a piece of land outside Monrovia and build an orphanage and give some of the street kids a home and someone to love them’.  And in that very moment, I knew that we would make his dream a reality together.</p>
<p>Over this past year, I founded a non-profit organization in Germany called ‘Growing Tree Liberia’ (GTL) that I work for on a volunteer basis, and U-Jay and his friend and partner, Melvin, have founded the Liberian partner organization, Growing Tree Child Care Program’ (GTCCP). The office in Monrovia has been been set up with all of its logistical needs, and the process of receiving accreditation as an orphanage is almost complete.</p>
<p>And just in the past few weeks, a perfect 10-acre piece of land has been found in Bomi County, just north of the city.  Extensive consultations have been carried out with the community that is selling the land, including meetings with the chief and the elders, as well as with the women and youth of the community. I was in Liberia the first week of December to visit the national office and see the progress my partners have made and I had the opportunity to visit the land and meet with some of the community members themselves.  They are thrilled about our project  - not only about having a buyer for the land who is dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable children, but also who will help give back to the community.</p>
<p>The community is selling the land at a very reasonable price, but we need to raise $45,000 as quickly as possible to make the purchase. The sooner we can buy the land, the sooner we can begin with the construction of the buildings and the sooner we can open our doors to 50 children who desperately need a home. Any donation over $150 ensures that your name and where you live will be documented on a large plaque on the main building of the orphanage site. If for some reason our campaign doesn't reach $45,000, the money that was raised will nevertheless go solely toward the purchase of the land and I will continue to look for funds in other ways. </p>
<p>No one knows for sure how many orphans there are in the country of Liberia, but with extreme levels of poverty, the recent Ebola crisis, and only a bare minimum of health care in the country, thousands of children are greatly suffering on a daily basis. We want to relieve suffering to whatever extent we can by offering a home, an education and somewhere that children can feel safe, before hopefully finding a more permanent, loving home for them. Your contribution will help us be able to reach out our hands to others who so desperately need our help. </p>
</div><div> </div><div><p>Building and maintaining an orphanage in Liberia is certainly not going to be easy.  But nothing in life that really makes you proud comes easy. For me, challenges inspire me to think more, solve problems, find good partners and work harder. Those who know me know that I have never shied away from a challenge and in this case, carrying out this project will actually have a direct and very significant impact on vulnerable children who are now living without any hope for a future. Therefore, meeting this challenge is essential. And most importantly, I have two very competent and very trustworthy partners in Liberia who are building this dream with me.</p></div><p>If you are unable to donate right now, that's ok!  I would just love for you to pass on this message to anyone and everyone you know who you think may be interested.  Spread the word and help us reach the funds we need! </p></div>","Ask a seasoned world traveler to name their favorite place, and few would probably choose the place closest to my heart: Liberia.

The launch event will feature a live stream premiere of a film the campaign aims to produce; '#<strong>Coming out of the Spiritual Closet</strong>' </p><p><strong>WHAT and HOW? </strong></p><p>The campaign will consist of three main things:</p><p>A collection of photos on a regular blog that depict experiencers of spiritual phenomena ‘#<b>Emerging Proud</b>’ in support of this campaign. This will then form the basis for a special edition book commemorating this momentous day if we raise enough funds. </p><p>Make any pledge and YOU are invited to send in your own photo which will feature as part of the campaign; these will be shared on social media until the big launch day on 17th March 2017. They will then form an ‘#<strong>Emerging Proud!</strong>’ feature on my website, and hopefully also on a website dedicated to <strong>Coming Out of the Spiritual Closet, in addition to a special edition book commemorating the event. </strong></p><p>I will be collecting 2 min video clips from contributors (hopefully YOU!) telling the public why the campaign is so important to you. </p><p>These clips will then form a montage for a <strong>full length film '#Coming out of the Spiritual Closet</strong>' <strong>to premiere internationally on 17th March 2017.</strong>  The film will then be available post- launch to watch for <strong>free</strong> via my website, ISEN's website and a few <u>special guest collaborators</u> in order to help the thousands of people going through the spiritual emergence process worldwide.</p><p>During the campaign I’ll be sharing <strong>exclusive</strong> interviews with <u>special guests -</u> experts in the field and experiencers who will talk about themselves ‘#<b>Emerging Proud</b>’; maybe some will even come out live during the campaign!</p><p>I don’t intend this to be just a short fix – when the campaign ends after the 17th Nov I will stay engaged with you, continuing to provide interviews, powerful stories and risqué blogs covering some of the more extreme ends of spiritual emergence experiences until the film launches on the <strong>17th March 2017</strong>. </p><p><strong>This will then be recognized as International #EmergingProud Day!</strong></p><p><b>Potential Impact</b></p><p>We only have to look at the magnitude of positive change that Gay Pride has created - well this is about doing the same, and more, for spiritual experiences! With YOUR involvement, we can expand the public perception of 'normal' all over the world. This is about creating a political transformation agenda. People who experience spiritual phenomena have Human Rights that are not being acknowledged. </p><p>Have you experienced spiritual phenomena and share my passion to raise awareness in order to make the journey easier for others who are 'waking up'?</p><p>This is my plea to YOU to join me in making your voice heard. Together we can '<a href=""https://katiemottram.com/coming-out-of-the-spiritual-closet/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emerge Proud</a>.' I hope that our stories can provide a step along the bridge to ‘<a href=""https://katiemottram.com/my-book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mending the Gap</a>’, and that the more of us who dare to speak out, the more ‘normalised’ and accepted these experiences will become within society in general. </p><p>As Mahatma Ghandi said, “<strong><i>Be the change that you wish to see in the world</i></strong>.”</p><p>If you join me in being brave today, your efforts could go on to positively affect the lives of so many people going through the awakening process for years to come; we shouldn’t have to hide our reality or be ashamed to talk openly about it – WE can help reduce the stigma. Are you with me for the ride?</p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>The money stuff…</p><p>I need to fund the following essentials:</p><p>Campaign branding and graphic designs (logo / certificate / marketing materials), video editing and final film creation, marketing costs, press release, distribution platform for the film premiere and hopefully a dedicated website to continue raising awareness after the campaign ends. Publishing costs to create a special edition compilation book to mark the Inaugural <strong>'#Emerging Proud' day on 17th March 2017</strong></p><p>Finally, I need to fund myself – this is not easy to admit, but I have spent the last 4 years dedicating myself completely voluntarily to this work and I can no longer do it and sustain myself - I am struggling to survive but I have done too much to give up now. As we all know, part of integration after experiencing a spiritual awakening is juggling walking our path with earning a living, so this campaign does include funds to sustain me whilst I work on this for the next 6 months. If I raise more than my goal, I can promise you that I will continue to dedicate more of my time and focus to continuing this work for as long as I can. This is my life mission!  </p><p><strong>Your perks:</strong></p><p>Please see details on the Perks page, but as an overview... </p><p>You can be involved in the project, follow all of the news, receive updates about new exciting interviews with experiencers and experts in the field and even have your story feature in the campaign from as little as £5 donation to the cause. </p><p>If you are also struggling and cannot afford that but want to have your picture included in the campaign, please contact me. </p><p>If you get the importance of this and feel inspired to donate more than the amounts listed in the perks - <i>I love you!</i> - Please contact me directly and I will gladly accept. </p><p><strong>What I’ll do if I don’t reach my target:</strong></p><p>I will do all I can with the money raised.

The launch event will feature a live stream premiere of a film the campaign aims to produce; '#Coming out of the Spiritual Closet' WHAT and HOW? The campaign will consist of three main things:A collection of photos on a regular blog that depict experiencers of spiritual phenomena ‘#Emerging Proud’ in support of this campaign. This will then form the basis for a special edition book commemorating this momentous day if we raise enough funds. Make any pledge and YOU are invited to send in your own photo which will feature as part of the campaign; these will be shared on social media until the big launch day on 17th March 2017. They will then form an ‘#Emerging Proud!’ feature on my website, and hopefully also on a website dedicated to Coming Out of the Spiritual Closet, in addition to a special edition book commemorating the event. I will be collecting 2 min video clips from contributors (hopefully YOU!) telling the public why the campaign is so important to you. These clips will then form a montage for a full length film '#Coming out of the Spiritual Closet' to premiere internationally on 17th March 2017.  The film will then be available post- launch to watch for free via my website, ISEN's website and a few special guest collaborators in order to help the thousands of people going through the spiritual emergence process worldwide.During the campaign I’ll be sharing exclusive interviews with special guests - experts in the field and experiencers who will talk about themselves ‘#Emerging Proud’; maybe some will even come out live during the campaign!I don’t intend this to be just a short fix – when the campaign ends after the 17th Nov I will stay engaged with you, continuing to provide interviews, powerful stories and risqué blogs covering some of the more extreme ends of spiritual emergence experiences until the film launches on the 17th March 2017. This will then be recognized as International #EmergingProud Day!Potential ImpactWe only have to look at the magnitude of positive change that Gay Pride has created - well this is about doing the same, and more, for spiritual experiences! With YOUR involvement, we can expand the public perception of 'normal' all over the world. This is about creating a political transformation agenda. People who experience spiritual phenomena have Human Rights that are not being acknowledged. Have you experienced spiritual phenomena and share my passion to raise awareness in order to make the journey easier for others who are 'waking up'?This is my plea to YOU to join me in making your voice heard. Together we can 'Emerge Proud.' I hope that our stories can provide a step along the bridge to ‘Mending the Gap’, and that the more of us who dare to speak out, the more ‘normalised’ and accepted these experiences will become within society in general. As Mahatma Ghandi said, “Be the change that you wish to see in the world.”If you join me in being brave today, your efforts could go on to positively affect the lives of so many people going through the awakening process for years to come; we shouldn’t have to hide our reality or be ashamed to talk openly about it – WE can help reduce the stigma. Are you with me for the ride?What I Need & What You GetThe money stuff…I need to fund the following essentials:Campaign branding and graphic designs (logo / certificate / marketing materials), video editing and final film creation, marketing costs, press release, distribution platform for the film premiere and hopefully a dedicated website to continue raising awareness after the campaign ends. Publishing costs to create a special edition compilation book to mark the Inaugural '#Emerging Proud' day on 17th March 2017Finally, I need to fund myself – this is not easy to admit, but I have spent the last 4 years dedicating myself completely voluntarily to this work and I can no longer do it and sustain myself - I am struggling to survive but I have done too much to give up now. As we all know, part of integration after experiencing a spiritual awakening is juggling walking our path with earning a living, so this campaign does include funds to sustain me whilst I work on this for the next 6 months. If I raise more than my goal, I can promise you that I will continue to dedicate more of my time and focus to continuing this work for as long as I can. This is my life mission!  Your perks:Please see details on the Perks page, but as an overview... You can be involved in the project, follow all of the news, receive updates about new exciting interviews with experiencers and experts in the field and even have your story feature in the campaign from as little as £5 donation to the cause. If you are also struggling and cannot afford that but want to have your picture included in the campaign, please contact me. If you get the importance of this and feel inspired to donate more than the amounts listed in the perks - I love you! - Please contact me directly and I will gladly accept. What I’ll do if I don’t reach my target:I will do all I can with the money raised. If I haven't got enough to create the film or publish the book I'll still run the campaign and show all of your video contributions on social media and create the biggest hype I can before 17th March 2017. What I’ll do with the extra if I reach over my target:I pledge to continue raising awareness in any way I can with whatever the funds will allow - from writing articles for the media to organising big live events to bring together experiencers, expert speakers and researchers. I'll also donate to ISEN to enable us to continue working with people to develop Spiritual Emergence Networks in countries where they do not yet exist so people have access to free support around the world. Risks & ChallengesI've spent the last 4 years taking risks so I'm not going to stop here! Some of us know the risks of openly speaking about spiritual experiences only too well - there is the risk of losing family and friends, losing our job, being seen as completely crazy - the risks are real and they are huge. But we also know the risks of NOT speaking our truth; living a lie, becoming depressed and ill, feeling that life is not worth living. I am taking a risk because the alternative is worse... Ways You Can HelpIn addition to making a pledge you could... Help to get the word out - make some noise about the campaign and show people around you that they are not alone! Use the Indiegogo share tools, let's spread this far and wide on social media!Are you strapped for cash too but have a particular skill you’d like to donate to the campaign in exchange for taking part?

<h3>Don't Just Dream It - Achieve It!</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Carolyn Trafford and I help other people live the life they want.</p>
<p>Having spent 24 yrs in the financial services industry I finally managed to break free and set up Reflections Coaching.  A business designed to help others figure out what they actually want from life and then how to go and get it.  </p>
<p>My personal choice has been about getting my life back into balance and changing to a career that helped others.  I know first hand from coaching others that goal setting and motivation can be difficult.  So I penned ""Don't Just Dream It - Achieve It""</p>
<p>I could have just created a PDF and stuck it onto Amazon, but the great thing about my A5 spiral bound workbook is that it can be carried in a handbag or pocket, taken with you wherever you go and just be downright useful whenever you can spare some time.</p>
<p>I'm new to writing so self publishing a book means small print volumes and high costs.  I am appealing to potential investors to help me fund the printing costs.  By doing this I can afford to invest in a larger print run and drive down the cost of printing.  These costs are then passed onto the customer via a reduced retail price for the book.</p>
<p>So investing is NOT paying for my time over the summer writing - I did not take a summer holiday this year!</p>
<p>Investing will help me retail this book at an affordable and sensible price.</p>
<p>Investing will enable me to order a batch of approximately 100 books - rather than ten.  </p>
<p>Investing will enable me to retail the book at approximately £12-15 rather than £20-25.</p>
<p>Please take time to watch the video its not very long and filming it was a painful process for someone who prefers to be behind a camera.</p>
<p><strong>hat We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>I've set a fund-raising goal of £3000, however this is flexible and whatever is raised will be invested directly into publishing and marketing.  I really need a minimum of £1500 to do an initial run of 200 books.  I am avoiding using any online printing companies and will be printing directly through companies that I know.</p>
<p>You get a choice of perks.  Your perk will be sent to you at the end of the campaign (Early December).  All perks include a copy of the book, either hard print or pdf - though I do recommend a printed version.  Optional perks include coaching support via email or over the phone, or if possible face to face.</p>
<p>Another optional perk is the beautiful ""Don't Just Dream It"" mug - great as a motivational reminder that you DO want to make your dreams a reality.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>My main challenge is getting the book in front of people who will buy it.  I have an extensive network both face to face and through social media so will be using my network to market together with a small marketing budget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't financially contribute don't worry (or even if you can) - I need to reach as many people as possible - you can really help by emailing your contacts or sharing on social media. Indiegogo have some great share tools!</p>

<p>Quote from 20th Century spiritual teacher and mystique<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i>The sound of AUM is heard only
when your mind is completely silent, when you have gone beyond all language,

very being. We are made of it.</i></span></p>

<p>Our campaign is to get the whole world (well at least a good percentage of the whole world) to AUM at the same time, on the same day for a short period of 15 minutes followed by 5 minutes of silence, every year.  Can you imagine one single sound vibration emitted by millions of people all over the world?  </p>

<p>In 1993 there was a dramatic sociological experiment that took place in  Washington, D.C. 4,000 TM practitioners 81 countries gathered together to practice transcendental meditation from June 7 to July 30.<b> </b> During the 7 weeks period of time violent crime was reduced be  23 percent. The odds of this happening by chance is less than 2
in 1 billion! </p>
<a href=""http://www.istpp.org/Hagelin_bio.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>John Hagelin</span></a>, lead author of the study and
director of the <a href=""http://www.istpp.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Institute
of Science, Technology </a> at
Maharishi University said ‘meditation creates a state of deep relaxation and
coherence in the individual and simultaneously produces an effect that spreads
into the environment, influencing people who are not practicing the techniques
and who have no knowledge of the experiments themselves.""</div><div>
<p>We live in an auspicious time where the global net allows us to connect everybody on earth together in one instant like we have never been able to connect before. Repetition  of Aum is similar to the practice of TM and we feel Aum has the potential to create an extraordinary, never felt before, vibration phenomena across the entire planet. </p>
<p>There are many beautiful organisations and individuals in the world who are advocates for world peace, healing and harmony. Small pockets of conscious Beings working for the greater good of this planet and humanity on the whole. BUT wouldn't it be even more beautiful if we could unite together as one global community. That time has come! NOW we can unite as one voice and just maybe our simple global gathering can be the start of something universally amazing.</p>
<p>Once we get the website completed we will begin to create a global network  and set the date for the first Global Aum. <br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">People will sign up on the site with their name, age, country etc and we hope to be able to create a function whereby each person can record their own unique Aum. At any time visitors to the site will be able to click on somebody's name and hear that persons Aum. The website will also enable visitors to get instant live statistics like:<br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> * how many people have signed up<br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> * how many people have signed up from specific countries<br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> * What percentage of people are female? male? under 20? etc <br/> * Etc Etc Etc.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">When people register on the Global on website there will be an option to also donate to the Global Aum community projects fund. All the money raised will be considered worldwide community funds and will be allocated to different global charities and projects by the founding members of Global Aum and Global Aum Ambassadors. </span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3> <p> Reaching out to people in every single country and crossing language barriers will be a challenge. We will be relying on a professional promotion campaigner to give the Global Aum Experience worldwide exposure and coverage.<br/>With a fully customised website we hope to have the website available in a number of different languages.</p>

A one week exclusive yoga retreat in the beautiful mountains of Austria with international yoga teacher. Including yoga, healthy food, sauna & spa and of course plenty of Aum chanting, Maximum 6 people in sharing accommodation 





If we dont reach our target we will seek other ways of adding funds so we can complete the Global Aum Experience. We will do our very best to actualise the Global Aum project!   What Can Aum Do? 
In 1993 there was a dramatic sociological experiment that took place in  Washington, D.C. 4,000 TM practitioners 81 countries gathered together to practice transcendental meditation from June 7 to July 30.  During the 7 weeks period of time violent crime was reduced be  23 percent. The odds of this happening by chance is less than 2
in 1 billion! 
John Hagelin, lead author of the study and
director of the Institute
of Science, Technology  at
Maharishi University said ‘meditation creates a state of deep relaxation and
coherence in the individual and simultaneously produces an effect that spreads
into the environment, influencing people who are not practicing the techniques
and who have no knowledge of the experiments themselves.""
We live in an auspicious time where the global net allows us to connect everybody on earth together in one instant like we have never been able to connect before. Repetition  of Aum is similar to the practice of TM and we feel Aum has the potential to create an extraordinary, never felt before, vibration phenomena across the entire planet. 
There are many beautiful organisations and individuals in the world who are advocates for world peace, healing and harmony. Small pockets of conscious Beings working for the greater good of this planet and humanity on the whole. BUT wouldn't it be even more beautiful if we could unite together as one global community. That time has come! NOW we can unite as one voice and just maybe our simple global gathering can be the start of something universally amazing.
Once we get the website completed we will begin to create a global network  and set the date for the first Global Aum. People will sign up on the site with their name, age, country etc and we hope to be able to create a function whereby each person can record their own unique Aum. At any time visitors to the site will be able to click on somebody's name and hear that persons Aum. The website will also enable visitors to get instant live statistics like: * how many people have signed up * how many people have signed up from specific countries * What percentage of people are female? male? under 20? etc  * Etc Etc Etc.
When people register on the Global on website there will be an option to also donate to the Global Aum community projects fund. All the money raised will be considered worldwide community funds and will be allocated to different global charities and projects by the founding members of Global Aum and Global Aum Ambassadors. 
    Challenges  Reaching out to people in every single country and crossing language barriers will be a challenge. We will be relying on a professional promotion campaigner to give the Global Aum Experience worldwide exposure and coverage.With a fully customised website we hope to have the website available in a number of different languages.

    Other Ways You Can Help Let everyone know. Talk about 'Global Aum' with your friends, family, co-workers, community. This is an exciting opportunity to get the WHOLE WORLD to unite and create a global sound vibration that could quite possible create a long overdue shift in global consciousness. 
We have already registered the domain name www.globalaum.com.

Our studio was part of the Master of Infrastructure Planning (MIP) program. </p>
<p>Between September of last year until January we worked on an entry for the Global Schindler Award, a design competition looking for an original design concept that would engage the specific spatial condition in Shenzhen, China ""Considering the Interface between Mobility and the City"". </p>
<p>This was the first time in the history of the competition that it opened for North American universities. Out of the 250 total submission, only 12 were chosen. We are one of those teams! </p>
<p>We are the only U.S. based team and we are traveling to Shenzhen to accept the award and see the site we became so passionate about! </p> </div> <div> <h3>Why we need your help! </h3> <p>Traveling to Shenzhen isn't cheap. Between airfare, hotel and transportation we expect each one of us to spend more then $2000.  We're all college students and lets be honest, we can't afford this on our own! </p>
<p>As designers we believe that you cannot design for a place without knowing it. For months we used, maps, books, comics, journals, youtube videos and virtual street views images to learn Shenzhen and propose a design specific to the needs of the local community.

</div></div>","Our Story...   We are 11 students (a mix of undergraduates and graduate students) led by Georgeen Theodore at New Jersey Institute of Technology, School of Architecture and Design in Newark. Our studio was part of the Master of Infrastructure Planning (MIP) program. 
Between September of last year until January we worked on an entry for the Global Schindler Award, a design competition looking for an original design concept that would engage the specific spatial condition in Shenzhen, China ""Considering the Interface between Mobility and the City"". 
This was the first time in the history of the competition that it opened for North American universities. Out of the 250 total submission, only 12 were chosen. We are one of those teams! 
We are the only U.S. based team and we are traveling to Shenzhen to accept the award and see the site we became so passionate about!    Why we need your help!  Traveling to Shenzhen isn't cheap. Between airfare, hotel and transportation we expect each one of us to spend more then $2000.  We're all college students and lets be honest, we can't afford this on our own! 
As designers we believe that you cannot design for a place without knowing it. For months we used, maps, books, comics, journals, youtube videos and virtual street views images to learn Shenzhen and propose a design specific to the needs of the local community. We couldn't go before, but we definitely have a will and reason now! 
The $5000 that we are asking for will be spent on air-fare, trains, hotels and visa applications. 
    What's so important about this?  Our project, SEZ to EZX: Shenzhen Xrossroads, proposes that rather than starting again and remaking the site anew, SQ should build on what it already has going for it: existing agglomerations of small and mid-sized firms, clusters of urban villages, incredible road and raid infrastructure, and (a nearly lost) network of rivers. Our vision is the EZX, a next-generation economic zone that facilitates the growth of migrant  business enterprises and (MBEs) and offers a mix of housing options that will help retain the migrant population. The existing east-west and north-south transportation corridors are transformed into ""stitched"", high density, mixed use, green-blue development (the ""X"").

<p>Missouri (and the World) Needs Dinosaurs!</p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>The Missouri Institute of Natural Science is a facility in
Springfield, MO, dedicated to studying the natural past to help better understand
the present and predict the future. We started small, grew to medium, and now we’re
ready to really take off. Our fossil and mineral collection grows daily, and we
want to show it to you. We want to show it to you for FREE. We’re cool like
that. We have never charged admittance to the museum, and we hope we never
will. Despite this generosity and seeming lack of good business sense over the
last 14 years, we’ve managed to make it this far. We’ve done this without
incurring any debt, and that’s pretty amazing. We’ve done this using only
volunteers, dedicated volunteers. We’ve done this in the buckle of the Bible
belt, where young-Earth Creationism keeps the teaching of evolution out of our
schools, and that goes beyond amazing. But now we want to get bigger. We’ve got
the stuff to show, we just need more room to show it. We need a bigger
building. We’ve got the land, we’ve got the building design, and we’ve got a
large part of our funding. But we’re not quite where we need to be financially
to give the public the quality product they deserve. This is where you come in.</p>
<p><b>Where We Are Now</b></p>
<p>We have exhibits featuring some of the oldest rocks on earth.
We can show you fossils from the Permian, the Carboniferous, the Cretaceous,
and into the Pleistocene, but we could show you a lot more stuff if we had the
room. We’ve got it tucked away in storage, we’ve got it in the process of being
prepared for display, and we’re going all over the country collecting donated
materials and even digging up stuff ourselves. </p>
<p>Right now we’re working on the restoration and mounting of
Henry, a triceratops dug and retrieved by the Institute’s excavation team. Not
for nothing, but restoration is expensive and time consuming. We got it
handled, though. We do it for free and out of our own pockets because we love
it. The problem, though, is giving Henry, who will be the largest mounted
triceratops in America once complete, the quality exhibit structure and setting
he deserves. In addition to being the largest mounted triceratops, Henry will
also be the only mounted fossilized dinosaur in Missouri. Let me say that again:
THE ONLY MOUNTED FOSSIL DINOSAUR IN
MISSOURI. Come on, Missouri. You can be better than that.</p>
<p>“But Missouri Institute of Natural Science,” you might be
saying, “there’s really not that many dinosaurs that have even been found in
Missouri.” You’d be right. Henry is from Wyoming. But we have access to the
site where those Missouri dinosaurs were found. And we’ll dig them up and put
them on display. We’ve got some fossil specimens from that site now. We want
some more. We need a place to show them to you. </p>
<p>Dinosaurs are cool, but some people like other things. To
make those people happy, we’ve got minerals. And we have some pretty good
displays of those. We can have more. If you like minerals and rocks, we’ve got
‘em and we want you to come see them. But when you come, we want to make sure
we knock your socks off. We need to make our displays the best they can be for
you. Maybe dinosaurs and minerals aren’t your thing. Let me take another stab
at it.</p>
<p>Ice Age mammals. The Missouri Institute of Natural Science rocks
the Ice Age hardcore. We’ve got saber tooth cats, hyaenedons, mammoth,
mastodon, oreodont…the list goes on and on. The really cool part is that not
only do we have displays of these animals, but we have an actual fossil site on
the museum grounds. Riverbluff Cave is the oldest Ice Age fossil cave in North
America. We’ve found fossils and trace fossils of the giant short-face bear,
mammoths, American lion, peccaries, and more. We’re still looking and still
finding more. The cave is cool, but is closed to the public because it is still
a research cave. In the future, if funding is available, we can run paleontological
and geological field schools out of the cave for college students and people
who want to learn and get dirty. The fossils are on display, though. Most of
them. We have more. We’ll find more. We want you to see them.</p>
<p><b>Where We Want to Be</b></p>
<p>Nothing succeeds like success. Given room enough, the museum
could easily become a DESTINATION. In the world of museums, DESTINATION status
is greatly desired. So yeah, we want to be that. We want to be the place people
go to see real dinosaurs and more in the Midwest. When those people come to the
museum, they will make donations, and buy some of the cool stuff from our gift
shop. That will help us maintain the facility and pay the bills. But most of
all, those people will tell others about us. Bringing in more people who will
make donations and buy cool stuff.</p>
<p>Another success which will help us further succeed is through
our educational outreach program. We send volunteers to schools to talk about
our mission and our dinosaurs. Put a piece of fossilized dinosaur poop in a ten
year old’s hand, and you’ve made a friend for life. And then those students
become involved. They will bug their teachers to visit our museum on a field
trip or bug their parents to bring them on a weekend. Volunteers help make the
field trip a good experience. We DO charge for field trips from schools, because
they get to do and see some extra stuff when they come visit us. The better
facility we can offer, the more field trips we get. The more field trips, the
more kids get inspired about science and the natural world.</p>
<p><b>What We’re Up Against</b></p>
<p>The Missouri Institute of Natural Science is a 501(C3)
organization, or not-for-profit organization. We face the same obstacle that
many not-for-profit organizations face: indifference. Other organizations
advocate for babies, children, cures for diseases, and a variety of admirable
goals. Those things are great, and well worth supporting. But while they may face indifference, they
rarely face opposition. The mission of The Missouri Institute of Natural
Science is a different story. WE think its well worth supporting, but there are
people, particularly in the surrounding area, who find our mission objectionable.
They prefer us to stay small and easy to ignore. We have rarely faced active
opposition, but we have faced it. It’s the passive opposition that hurts. Right
now, that passive opposition is winning. 
It’s keeping teachers who know better from teaching evolution in the classroom.
That’s right, many students in this region graduate high school knowing
evolution is a thing, but they have no idea about how it works or the changes
proposed since it was introduced. This passive opposition is also a factor in
the greater community. Individuals and local businesses that rely on public
goodwill are reluctant to be seen supporting the Institute. So we’re taking it
to the streets and the internet. Springfield has a variety of views, and we are
grateful for our supporters in this area, but to reach our goals, we need more.</p>
<p><b>What You Can Do</b></p>

Give us money. Give
us a little, or give us a lot. It’s all tax deductible. We’ll take a dollar. Every
dollar helps. If you’re serious about helping us in our mission, though, give more than a dollar. We’ll give you stuff. We WANT to
give you stuff. Check out our perks. If you get the chance, come visit us. We
love visitors and want a whole lot more. Thank you for giving us the chance to
educate the community and provide a sorely needed resource in this area.<p></p></div>","Missouri (and the World) Needs Dinosaurs!

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></div>
<p>Right now, students’ wallets are being gouged to keep up with the cost of their text books. Right now, students are being given the run around as to why the newest edition of textbooks are “required” when we know not much really changes. The reason for all this is simple: textbooks make large profits for school book stores, online sites and publishers.  How many times have you purchased a book and used only a portion of it for a class and thought you weren't getting your money’s worth?  How many of you have been in the library at your school and wondered, ""Where are the books I need?” </p>
<p>Textbook Collective aims to lower the price of textbook rentals to under $150 per semester for every student.  If you have ever borrowed a book from a student who's taken the class before or loaned a book to a student in need, you know of the relief it brings. Textbook Collective runs on the same idea, but on a larger scale by borrowing books from and loaning to students across the country.  This gives you access to many more books than you can find among your friends, and gets the most value out of the books you have already purchased while guaranteeing your book's safety. Textbook Collective can streamline this process and bring the price per rental under $13 per book per semester, which includes standard shipping both ways.</p>
<p>By donating to Textbook Collective we can get started loaning books to students below any price on the market, freeing up resources for students and keeping big investors out of the textbook rental industry.  With every donation and book loan, students are investing in their own education and that of their peers.  There are over 21 million students in the United States. Those with a full schedule each need at least 4-5 textbooks.  The books were out there last semester, so let’s put them to work for us.</p>

    Risks & Challenges

Challenges: 
Getting the website, warehousing, shipping and receiving software written and working in a timely manner so we can get books in and out as efficiently as possible.  
We have programmers who have created and integrated these types of systems before and know that thousands of libraries around the world already run similar systems.
Getting enough books in the system so there is a large selection for everyone.  
If every contributor talks to the people in their major at their school, then you are ensuring that the books you need are waiting for you and future students.
The logistics of moving all these books every semester.  
We plan to optimize our warehouse and already have people with experience in high volume shipping companies.
Attending to customers’ needs and concerns as Textbook Collective grows.  
We want your experience with Textbook Collective to be the best it can be.  Were here to serve and help you get the books you need for the smallest price.  As we get larger we will hire the customer service staff required to answer your questions in a timely manner.
Risks:
People damaging your book.  
Most people don't damage library books or rental books, and when mistakes happen, they have to pay.  Same here.  If your book is damaged or lost, the person who checked it out will be held responsible, whether it be through fees or the cost of the book. 

    Other Ways You Can Help

If you are a recent graduate and would like to put your books into Textbook Collective even if you're not going to check out any books, GREAT!   We need all the books we can get.  If you have siblings or friends, you can let them use your books to get the books they need as well.  
If you're a parent, grandparent, teacher, counselor, or mentor you can donate in the name of you child who will someday be in college.  Just like investing in a college savings fund, donating to start Textbook Collective now will allow your student to save in the future.
Get the word out!  Everyone who knows someone in school should let them know about what we’re doing and why.  The more students we can serve the better. We'd rather have 20,000 students give $5 to meet our goal and tell all their friends, than have 5 investors give $20,000 each.  We’re here to serve students.

decided to wait, as I had no real business idea to develop. Times have
changed and as of now, I have been accepted to go to Draper for a 6-week

<p>Anyone living in a tourist community understands the frustration as small, local businesses give way to speculators and chain stores.  Dirk &amp; Darlene's hope is that the<i> Sweet Shop</i> can continue as a bakery, mirroring the hopes of the hundreds of customers who urged us to move forward with this campaign. Customers who left their fingerprints on these donut cases as children are now bringing their <b>grandchildren</b> to sample sweets created by Dirk, a 4th generation baker who began  his career in his grandparent's bakery in The Netherlands.  Without a sale, this will be the last season for the<i> Sweet Shop.  </i><b>Elk Rapids without the<i> Sweet Shop</i> is like...a donut without the hole.</b></p>

Regardless of their age, grade point, or level of affluence, teenage girls are in crisis.  Absent fathers, abusive boyfriends, family breakdowns, unhealthy role models, bullying, the sexualization of everything -- unrealistic expectations attacking their self-image from every angle.  In some cases adults are failing in their responsibility to support and protect them, requiring them to make adult decisions while they are still children, and leaving them feeling lost, inadequate, fearful, ungrounded and betrayed.<br/><p></p>

</div></div>","These pieces fit together like a donut and the hole... The First Piece-                                                                                                               An audible ""Gasp!"" spread through the community when a For Sale sign appeared on the side of the Sweet Shop.  As with any small town, there are places and traditions that are almost sacred -- this is one of them. 
Since 1955 the Sweet Shop has been a constant presence on River St. in the resort community of Elk Rapids, Michigan.  After 50 years as bakers, the current owners, Darlene & Dirk Renzema are looking forward to retirement and have the business up for sale.  Its valuable main street location has drawn interest from an assortment of developers -- all of whom see condos & high-end retail space as a more practical use.  That same prime location prices the property out of the reach of potential buyers focused on preserving this historic, community-supporting, award-winning, northern Michigan bakery - Best in Northern Michigan -- 11th best in the State
Anyone living in a tourist community understands the frustration as small, local businesses give way to speculators and chain stores.  Dirk & Darlene's hope is that the Sweet Shop can continue as a bakery, mirroring the hopes of the hundreds of customers who urged us to move forward with this campaign. Customers who left their fingerprints on these donut cases as children are now bringing their grandchildren to sample sweets created by Dirk, a 4th generation baker who began  his career in his grandparent's bakery in The Netherlands.  Without a sale, this will be the last season for the Sweet Shop.  Elk Rapids without the Sweet Shop is like...a donut without the hole.
The Second Piece-                                                                                             

Likewise, many girls growing up in today's world also feel less than complete. Regardless of their age, grade point, or level of affluence, teenage girls are in crisis.  Absent fathers, abusive boyfriends, family breakdowns, unhealthy role models, bullying, the sexualization of everything -- unrealistic expectations attacking their self-image from every angle.  In some cases adults are failing in their responsibility to support and protect them, requiring them to make adult decisions while they are still children, and leaving them feeling lost, inadequate, fearful, ungrounded and betrayed.
Since 2011, Right Tree, an Elk Rapids-based charity has been committed to helping girls discover their worth, their gifts, their voice, and their future.  Within a framework of outdoor recreation, camping and adventure programming we provide positive input, experiences and settings for girls to share, discuss, and address issues like relationships, bullying, social media, self-image, lies, and hope.  Our programs are available on a donations basis and our focus is to make sure every teen girl believes and lives out our theme: Every girl matters!  Check out our website



How These Pieces Fit-                                                                                               While Right Tree relies on like-minded donors, we also believe today's charities are called to develop creative, innovative and sustainable revenue sources.  Right Tree Adventure Rentals is one of those sources for us.  With equipment donated specifically for that purpose, our shop offers outdoor recreational equipment rentals (kayaks, stand up paddle boards, bikes, etc) to the community on a donation basis. The natural resources around us become accessible to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay, AND Right Tree has a constant and predictable source of income.  Donations flow directly back into Right Tree programs.  In 2014 the rental shop generated 40% of our operating revenue.  We want to expand that model by purchasing the Sweet Shop -- saving a successful historic business AND using that success to change the experiences and expectations of girls in our community.  

Here's What We Need:
 Right Tree Adventure Rentals would not exist without the initial donation of equipment.  That initial gift has generated 160% of its value to date and continues to grow each year.  The shop provides visibility for our programs, new experiences to residents & visitors, free equipment use for schools & other non-profits, summer jobs for a number of teens and college students AND a substantial portion of operational funding for Right Tree.
The Sweet Shop has the potential to multiply that successful model MANY times over -- in terms of visibility, revenue, community support and job creation. Donating a bakery is expensive.  Especially one sitting on a prime piece of resort property. With your help we can kill two birds with one stone -- saving this historic business and using it to expand and sustain the business of transforming girls' lives.
Here's what a donated bakery costs:

$329,000 bakery property/building/business/recipes/training
$    8,045   perks - provided ONLY if we meet our goal
$  35,000  closing/licensing/upgrade/interim costs
$  27,854   Indiegogo and online pay service fulfillment fees
        $399,899  TOTAL Because of confidentiality restrictions, we cannot share specific financial information regarding the bakery.   Dirk & Darlene have operated it for 22 years and it remains a successful, healthy enterprise with a 39% profit margin prior to owner distributions.  The sale includes their agreement to continue to work with  and train our staff during the transition.  
This is an all-or-nothing project for Right Tree.  As with the rental center -- without the donation of the original equipment, it could not have happened.  Without reaching our financial goal, the purchase of the Sweet Shop  cannot happen. With the success of this campaign, Right Tree will assume ownership in the fall of 2015.  If we fall short of our goal, 100% of the moneys received will be used to further the long-range goals and objectives of Right Tree:

provide year-round programming
expand to include 6-12th grade girls
provide programming for middle school boys
provide resources for parents
develop tools to facilitate healthy adult/teen interactions

All gifts are tax deductible and contributors will receive an email receipt for tax purposes.

Besides purely providing funding for programs, we can:


provide jobs & job training for area teens
provide opportunities for adults to share their professional baking skills with teens
partner with The Great Lakes Culinary Institute as a venue for resources, support and placement of students and graduates
serve as an outlet and provide support for related home-based businesses
partner with other local non-profits in their fundraising efforts

improve awareness of the full spectrum of Right Tree programs


With your help, this will be a win/win for the entire community!


    Risks & Challenges  Admittedly, moving into the realm of baking presents a new challenge.  Much of that is being addressed by the Renzemas' willingness to provide training in both their time-honored recipes and their techniques.  While the bakery offers tremendous opportunity for growth -- for the immediate future, mirroring their model is a reliable path to success.  Renzemas will continue to operate the bakery through this coming tourist season -- turning over the reins after the completion of their, and our, busiest season -- giving us the winter to train our team, re-open, and re-launch!

I knew this program was competitive; for the application you had  to turn in your transcript and write an essay. It was very similar to a normal college application. After feeling bad that I could not afford it a friend of mine told me to start a fundraising account so I could raise the money. I am willing to do whatever it takes to go to my dream school, I know this 6 week program is a once in a lifetime opportunity  and I am determined to experience it.However, If I am unable to reach my goal I will save the money and put it in my college application fund.

For one month each year, anyone can teach a course on just about any topic under the sun. And Bethel residents and neighbors from nearby towns can take courses for free.  Our goal is to share and showcase the many talents of Bethel residents, help local entrepreneurs spread the word about their skills and offerings, and bring more residents out into the community to meet, mingle, and explore the wealth of talent in our town.<br/></p>
<p>Bethel University launched in March, 2014 for our inaugural semester.  It was an incredible success, with <a href=""betheluniversityvt.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">18 courses</a> and over 130 registrations!  The second semester of BU is already underway with registration open for <a href=""https://betheluniversityvt.wordpress.com/take-course/2015-courses/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">36 diverse courses and 7 new “meet-up groups”</a> being offered this March.<br/></p>
<p>Bethel is a town of about 2,000 residents spread over 45 square miles of hills and valleys in the Green Mountains of central Vermont.  Bethel University was created by the Bethel Revitalization Initiative (BRI).  We are residents and volunteers with a desire to help our small, rural community be as vibrant, fun, and inclusive as possible, even in the middle of snowy New England winters!  By funding our campaign, you will be supporting our initiative to keep classes free and therefore accessible to everyone in our community.  </p> </div> <div> <br/>
<h3>What We Need</h3> <p>Let's break down what we need in a bit more detail.  Bethel University is truly a community effort.  Organizers and teachers offer their time, resources, and expertise.  Teachers, local businesses, and the town generously offer venue space and supplies when possible.  Keeping costs to a minimum is a top priority, and while our costs are few, there are some.  Primarily: </p>
<ul>
<li>Class supplies:  Occasionally funds are required for supplies to make a class possible and accessible to all students.  For example, arts and crafts supplies, guidebooks and pamphlets, or general printing needs.</li>
<li>Printing Costs:  We print posters to hang around our community, as well as postcards that can be handed/mailed out, listing our class offerings and how to sign up.  We also print diplomas of participation for our graduates, especially our younger ones.  These diplomas are designed by a young community volunteer!  <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1257371/files/20150228194631-BU_Cert.JPG?1425181591"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</li>
<li>Advertising:  We run a spot in the local newspaper as well, noting the course offerings and how to find out more.  </li>
</ul>
We're looking to raise funds for this year and, hopefully, future years to come.  This will help supplement the amazing support we have already received from local businesses and the New England Grassroots Environment Fund.<br/><div><br/></div>

</div>If you are a Bethel resident or a resident of a nearby town, regardless of whether you donate or not, you have the opportunity to:</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Register for any of the <a href=""https://betheluniversityvt.wordpress.com/take-course/2015-courses/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">diverse classes</a> that are being offered this year,</li>

<li>Attend our graduation social at the end of March.</li> </ul>
<div>Additionally, we have had interest from some other towns about replicating this idea, and we are happy to share what we've developed and learned.  Whether you are near or far, if you are interested in trying to make this model a reality in your community, feel free to reach out to us, via our website at <a href=""https://betheluniversityvt.wordpress.com/contact/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">betheluniversityvt.wordpress.com</a>, with your questions.</div>

<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/>
</h3> <p>BU is about community.  Our teachers are all volunteers from our community who are generously offering their time to teach courses.  They have a genuine interest in what they are teaching and want to share their knowledge with anyone else who is interested in learning about a particular topic.  Without them, there is no BU.  <br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In our first year (2014), 21 “professors” offered BU courses ranging from Zumba to vermicomposting, quilt making to BBQ.  There were 134 registrations by residents of Bethel and 10 surrounding towns. 75% of participants say they learned new information and 95% of professors say they feel more connected to the community.</span><br/></p>
<p>This year we have <a href=""https://betheluniversityvt.wordpress.com/take-course/2015-courses/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">36 courses plus 7 meet-up groups planned</a>, and we hit 100 course registrations in just the first two days after registration opened!  The response has been amazing and we're all encouraged and motivated to continue bringing the simple idea to reality for the residents and neighbors of Bethel.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We want this to be accessible to anyone in our community, regardless of age or income.  One of the keys to being accessible and inclusive is to remove any barriers that would prevent someone from signing up.  For this reason, we feel that classes at BU must be free for anyone to join.</p>

</div></div>","What is Bethel University? Bethel University is a unique community pop-up (temporary) university in Bethel, Vermont. For one month each year, anyone can teach a course on just about any topic under the sun. And Bethel residents and neighbors from nearby towns can take courses for free.  Our goal is to share and showcase the many talents of Bethel residents, help local entrepreneurs spread the word about their skills and offerings, and bring more residents out into the community to meet, mingle, and explore the wealth of talent in our town.
Bethel University launched in March, 2014 for our inaugural semester.  It was an incredible success, with 18 courses and over 130 registrations!  The second semester of BU is already underway with registration open for 36 diverse courses and 7 new “meet-up groups” being offered this March.
Bethel is a town of about 2,000 residents spread over 45 square miles of hills and valleys in the Green Mountains of central Vermont.  Bethel University was created by the Bethel Revitalization Initiative (BRI).  We are residents and volunteers with a desire to help our small, rural community be as vibrant, fun, and inclusive as possible, even in the middle of snowy New England winters!  By funding our campaign, you will be supporting our initiative to keep classes free and therefore accessible to everyone in our community.     
What We Need Let's break down what we need in a bit more detail.  Bethel University is truly a community effort.  Organizers and teachers offer their time, resources, and expertise.  Teachers, local businesses, and the town generously offer venue space and supplies when possible.  Keeping costs to a minimum is a top priority, and while our costs are few, there are some.  Primarily: 

Class supplies:  Occasionally funds are required for supplies to make a class possible and accessible to all students.  For example, arts and crafts supplies, guidebooks and pamphlets, or general printing needs.
Printing Costs:  We print posters to hang around our community, as well as postcards that can be handed/mailed out, listing our class offerings and how to sign up.  We also print diplomas of participation for our graduates, especially our younger ones.  These diplomas are designed by a young community volunteer!  

Advertising:  We run a spot in the local newspaper as well, noting the course offerings and how to find out more.  

We're looking to raise funds for this year and, hopefully, future years to come.  This will help supplement the amazing support we have already received from local businesses and the New England Grassroots Environment Fund.

What You Get
If you are a Bethel resident or a resident of a nearby town, regardless of whether you donate or not, you have the opportunity to:

Register for any of the diverse classes that are being offered this year,
Meet new friends and neighbors, and share in our great community,

Teach a class next year! If you're interested, start thinking about ideas now!
Attend our graduation social at the end of March. 
Additionally, we have had interest from some other towns about replicating this idea, and we are happy to share what we've developed and learned.  Whether you are near or far, if you are interested in trying to make this model a reality in your community, feel free to reach out to us, via our website at betheluniversityvt.wordpress.com, with your questions.
  

The Impact
 BU is about community.  Our teachers are all volunteers from our community who are generously offering their time to teach courses.  They have a genuine interest in what they are teaching and want to share their knowledge with anyone else who is interested in learning about a particular topic.  Without them, there is no BU.  
In our first year (2014), 21 “professors” offered BU courses ranging from Zumba to vermicomposting, quilt making to BBQ.  There were 134 registrations by residents of Bethel and 10 surrounding towns. 75% of participants say they learned new information and 95% of professors say they feel more connected to the community.
This year we have 36 courses plus 7 meet-up groups planned, and we hit 100 course registrations in just the first two days after registration opened!  The response has been amazing and we're all encouraged and motivated to continue bringing the simple idea to reality for the residents and neighbors of Bethel.

We want this to be accessible to anyone in our community, regardless of age or income.  One of the keys to being accessible and inclusive is to remove any barriers that would prevent someone from signing up.  For this reason, we feel that classes at BU must be free for anyone to join.


Other Ways You Can Help

 If you can't contribute financially, we understand, but that doesn't mean you can't still help out!  There are many ways you can pitch in, particularly if you are a Bethel, VT resident or neighbor:  Share this effort online and offline, with friends, family, and groups you participate in.  Help us get the word out about Bethel University! Feel free to share our website as well as some great press we've received too!

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>By contributing to our project you ensure that our students receive even better educational tools and you provide them with better prospects as they move towards their adult lives. We want to run a school that is consistently adapting to the needs of our fast moving contemporary world.</p>
<p>From our students perspective the recording studio and learning labs will give them an opportunity to explore their creativity in a new setting but it will also grant them scope to further develop their team building skills too. We want to challenge our students and we believe that this is an effective way to allow them to build their self esteem, take positive risks, and explore another avenue of commonality  with potential for innovation and self discovery.</p>
<p>Education doesn't have to be intangible. Instead, we can teach our youth <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">through experience and hands-on exploration, which the learning labs provide. We can use our labs to record music, podcasts, radio shows, and a list that only ends at our pupils inmaginations.</span></p>
<p>The learning labs can also be applied in a more practical sense to benefit our students engineering lessons. This in turn allows us to grow as a school and expand our mission statement too.<br/></p>
<p>Help us provide a form of autonomy for our young learners and share with us in the excitement of creating something new.<br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Possible Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Building something is always a challenge and this is no exception. We need to find the right equipment, we have to train staff members, and we have to be aware of the potential pitfalls in implementing our plan.</p>
<p>But we are a school driven by innovation, helmed by the mission to challenge our students, and we strive to take positive risks. This is an apt description for this funding campaign as well. Yes, there are challenges but we feel equipped to deal with them and we always reflect on what works, and what doesn't.<br/></p>
In order to overcome our potential pitfalls we will<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> switch gears readily when we find that our current methods are not completely effective.<br/><br/></span><b>
</b><p>Our school has a small student population, a committed staff and a loyal parent base that will allow for necessary changes to take
place. A framework for thinking skills will help students make sense of this
ever-changing world.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">By building a learner-centered, hands-on
environment at a school with rigorous academics, high standards at its core, and
with participation from parents and teachers, we can ensure that the needs of the students
truly come first.</span></p>

Elite Scholars STEAM Academy will proactively plan and make changes in our
curriculum and instruction to enhance and compete within an ever changing
world.  

The students of Elite Scholars STEAM Academy will be
active participants in their learning. It is our charge to actively engage each
student in the development of their learning through hands-on experiential
learning processes that focuses on individual strengths. 






The Impact By contributing to our project you ensure that our students receive even better educational tools and you provide them with better prospects as they move towards their adult lives. We want to run a school that is consistently adapting to the needs of our fast moving contemporary world.
From our students perspective the recording studio and learning labs will give them an opportunity to explore their creativity in a new setting but it will also grant them scope to further develop their team building skills too. We want to challenge our students and we believe that this is an effective way to allow them to build their self esteem, take positive risks, and explore another avenue of commonality  with potential for innovation and self discovery.
Education doesn't have to be intangible. Instead, we can teach our youth through experience and hands-on exploration, which the learning labs provide. We can use our labs to record music, podcasts, radio shows, and a list that only ends at our pupils inmaginations.
The learning labs can also be applied in a more practical sense to benefit our students engineering lessons. This in turn allows us to grow as a school and expand our mission statement too.
Help us provide a form of autonomy for our young learners and share with us in the excitement of creating something new.    Possible Risks & Challenges
Building something is always a challenge and this is no exception. We need to find the right equipment, we have to train staff members, and we have to be aware of the potential pitfalls in implementing our plan.
But we are a school driven by innovation, helmed by the mission to challenge our students, and we strive to take positive risks. This is an apt description for this funding campaign as well. Yes, there are challenges but we feel equipped to deal with them and we always reflect on what works, and what doesn't.
In order to overcome our potential pitfalls we will switch gears readily when we find that our current methods are not completely effective.
Our school has a small student population, a committed staff and a loyal parent base that will allow for necessary changes to take
place. A framework for thinking skills will help students make sense of this
ever-changing world.
By building a learner-centered, hands-on
environment at a school with rigorous academics, high standards at its core, and
with participation from parents and teachers, we can ensure that the needs of the students
truly come first.

<p>The model taught

coming into this community each year, which will enable us to transport the
cards and new materials safely and without shipping costs. The potential to
support every child within this community is achievable!  A child's education costs an average of $15
USD per month, however, this does not include food.  Sponsorships cover a small portion of the

<li><p>To build and promote a constructive global platform for young people to trade ideas and methods to tackle corruption in all its forms. </p></li>
</ul><ul>

<li><p>With a Corruption Cost Index putting value on how damaging corruption is to specific societies and economies, ACI tries to provide an alternative to the Corruption Perception Index by Transparency International.  </p></li>
<li><p>ACI plans to develop policy suggestions to governments, international organisations and corporations on an anti-corruption charter based on scientific evidence on its capacity to reduce corruption.  </p></li>
<li><p>We will promote global anti-corruption campaigns and seek to raise awareness about the damage and indeed the cost of corruption across the world.</p></li>
<li><p>ACI intends to develop a corruption case studies database and provide online courses to address the education and awareness deficit regarding corruption. </p></li>

</ul><p><i>What we are giving back in return for your funding</i></p><p>ACI benefits the global society by ... </p><ul>

<li><p>Providing an international platform where all the youth can exchange their corruption stories, find solutions and gather their power to fight corruption.</p></li>
<li><p>Developing and campaigning for anti-corruption measures.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborating with civil anti-corruption organizations. </p></li>

We know that ACI can bring about revolutionary change in the world and we are determined to make a world free from corruption a reality.  Here is a selection of ideas ACI stands for:- Case studies and online workshops- Broad public awareness - Corruption Cost Index- International Anti-Corruption Court We are operating solely on voluntary work by more than 100 young people from the below countries (red). 
Nonetheless, we incur costs which we cannot pay without your support! ACI is headquartered in Norway but we encourage our members to set up National Chapters in their countries. To build up the infrastructure, register and connect to the community, we ask for 2000 EUR. 






Why not check us out on: 
Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Anti-Corruption-...On Twitter: https://twitter.com/AntiCorruptIntlOn our website: http://anticorruption-intl.org/_____________________________________________________________________________Please see below for more detailed information about ACI:Our originThe idea of ACI originated when students from over 100 countries came together at a student festival in Trondheim, Norway earlier this year. There, we traded ideas about corruption and discussed about feasible solutions. Being boosted with the optimism and positive energy of this event, all of us felt the need that we, as the future generations, have to do something big to significantly reduce corruption. We think that an organisation or better a platform bringing together young people with different educational backgrounds and different experiences of corruption in different cultures, is the best way for us to successfully fight corruption. Our objectivesAnti-Corruption International wants ...
To provide support to and educate young people about the destructive impact of corruption on societies across the world and indeed on human progress and development.
To build and promote a constructive global platform for young people to trade ideas and methods to tackle corruption in all its forms. 

To investigate and do research on anti-corruption measures by using the main strengths in young people’s arsenal: a burning desire to bring about a positive change in the world, an alternative vision for the future, free from limitations or obstacles from the past and creativity!
To push political and economic actors to put in place robust anti-corruption measures.
We are certain that ACI brings forward the fight against corruption and delivers actual change to the world. But how will the organization look?  Our basis of members will be divided into and work in chapters with local, national and regional focus to develop and exchange ideas about corruption. Simultaneously,  technology allows us to assemble and work in thematic committees, like e.g. Health or Education, to benefit from the exchange of topic specific ideas and experiences in a global environment.  Our projects ACI has a variety of ideas we will be working on. Some examples are:
We intend to operate our own Think-Tank/Research Institution, e.g. looking at how technology can reduce corruptive practices.
With a Corruption Cost Index putting value on how damaging corruption is to specific societies and economies, ACI tries to provide an alternative to the Corruption Perception Index by Transparency International.  
ACI plans to develop policy suggestions to governments, international organisations and corporations on an anti-corruption charter based on scientific evidence on its capacity to reduce corruption.  
We will promote global anti-corruption campaigns and seek to raise awareness about the damage and indeed the cost of corruption across the world.
ACI intends to develop a corruption case studies database and provide online courses to address the education and awareness deficit regarding corruption. 

Finally, ACI plans to create awareness within the group of young people with the introduction of an International Anti-Corruption Youth Day.



What we are giving back in return for your fundingACI benefits the global society by ... 
Educating the world of the consequences of corruption and encouraging especially the youth to speak up and to shape a corruption free society. 
Providing an international platform where all the youth can exchange their corruption stories, find solutions and gather their power to fight corruption.
Developing and campaigning for anti-corruption measures.
Collaborating with civil anti-corruption organizations. 

Corruption destroys the opportunity for many communities around the world to benefit from development aid or indeed projects aiming to increase participation in education or access to healthcare, so by tackling the root causes namely: corruption we can secure a world where development is not lost in the pockets of a corrupt few.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><b>RapidBio Systems, Inc. is developing a revolutionary new food borne bacteria testing systems which will give results in a matter of minutes! We have proof of concept and proof of principle showing our technology works! We need to optimize our test and then test our prototypes in real work conditions.</b></p>
<p>We are raising $150,000 to complete our test system and to get our testing system ready for critical field trials.  </p>
<p>Once we compete this critical stage we will be able to help decrease food-borne bacteria in food by detecting bacteria earlier in the global food chain.  Our test can be used in the growing fields, processing plants or anywhere in the food distribution chain. By using our test system, food producers and suppliers will be able to detect bacteria contamination faster and sooner so they can do something about the problem immediately...and not have to wait up to weeks to get the other tests results!  What a difference this will make!</p>
<p>My name is John Erickson and I am the President and CEO of RapidBio Systems.  I have been responsible for developing, commercializing and managing over 3 dozen scientific products with sales of over $3 billion in my career.  There isn't a bigger issue that we can help solve than this critical bacteria contamination issue. With your help and support we will be able to get this revolutionary testing system to market and start helping save lives!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your funding will go directly to completing the testing system and getting it ready for important field trials with major global food producers and leading universities. Specifically, the funds will go toward expanding the lab, bringing in more technical talent, finalize the optimization of the system and producing the final prototype testing systems that are ready for the field trials</p>
<p>To say ""thank you"" we are offering you some cool perks:</p>
<p>   $25 - personal thank you acknowledging your contribution from the President &amp; CEO</p>
<p>   $50 - T-shirt with RBS logo </p>
<p>   $100 - Coffee mug with RBS logo </p>
<p>   $500 - $50 Gift Card from American Express </p>
<p>   $1,000 - Skype call with the RBS President &amp; CEO</p>
<p>   $+2,000 - Private dinner with RBS President &amp; CEO </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The impact of our testing system on the food safety market will be significant! Fast test results will lead to products moving faster and safer through the food supply chain.  Hours, days and even weeks will be saved leading to a safer food supply for the world.  Just as point of care (POC) tests like doctor office tests, have improved health care, our testing system will have similar impact on food safety.  Results available quickly, when and where you need them most in order to make a critical decision on food safety.  I have been responsible for developing and commercializing numerous POC testing systems such as diabetic blood glucose tests and others on a global basis and have witnessed the significant impact these test has had in people's lives.  We can do the same with food safety with your help!</div>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Like every endeavor there are risks with what we are doing. It may take longer and more funding to get us to the field trials, out patents may be limited and after the field trials we may have to make additional changes to our system, in order to get it to market.</div>
<div>Our system is designed to be used by people with limited education and skill out in the fields, processing plants and warehouses.  By designing the testing system right, we will be able to train users in a matter of minutes and without a technical degree!  During my 30 years of industry experience, I have led teams who have done this before and we will leverage this experience and critical learning for our unique testing system. Our team has the skills to do this!</div>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>Even if you aren't able to make a financial contribution to our campaign you can still help.  Let others know what we are doing and ask them to check us out and make a contribution to help us change bacteria testing to improve the health of the world! </div>
<div>Don't forget to use all the Indiegogo share tools to make this happen.</div>
<div>Thank you for all your interest and help in making a difference to millions of people around the world who are affected by bacteria contamination in their food!</div>

RapidBio Systems, Inc. is developing a revolutionary new food borne bacteria testing systems which will give results in a matter of minutes! We have proof of concept and proof of principle showing our technology works! We need to optimize our test and then test our prototypes in real work conditions.
We are raising $150,000 to complete our test system and to get our testing system ready for critical field trials.  
Once we compete this critical stage we will be able to help decrease food-borne bacteria in food by detecting bacteria earlier in the global food chain.  Our test can be used in the growing fields, processing plants or anywhere in the food distribution chain. By using our test system, food producers and suppliers will be able to detect bacteria contamination faster and sooner so they can do something about the problem immediately...and not have to wait up to weeks to get the other tests results!  What a difference this will make!
My name is John Erickson and I am the President and CEO of RapidBio Systems.  I have been responsible for developing, commercializing and managing over 3 dozen scientific products with sales of over $3 billion in my career.  There isn't a bigger issue that we can help solve than this critical bacteria contamination issue. With your help and support we will be able to get this revolutionary testing system to market and start helping save lives!

What We Need & What You Get
Your funding will go directly to completing the testing system and getting it ready for important field trials with major global food producers and leading universities. Specifically, the funds will go toward expanding the lab, bringing in more technical talent, finalize the optimization of the system and producing the final prototype testing systems that are ready for the field trials
To say ""thank you"" we are offering you some cool perks:
   $25 - personal thank you acknowledging your contribution from the President & CEO
   $50 - T-shirt with RBS logo 
   $100 - Coffee mug with RBS logo 
   $500 - $50 Gift Card from American Express 
   $1,000 - Skype call with the RBS President & CEO
   $+2,000 - Private dinner with RBS President & CEO 

The Impact
The impact of our testing system on the food safety market will be significant! Fast test results will lead to products moving faster and safer through the food supply chain.  Hours, days and even weeks will be saved leading to a safer food supply for the world.  Just as point of care (POC) tests like doctor office tests, have improved health care, our testing system will have similar impact on food safety.  Results available quickly, when and where you need them most in order to make a critical decision on food safety.  I have been responsible for developing and commercializing numerous POC testing systems such as diabetic blood glucose tests and others on a global basis and have witnessed the significant impact these test has had in people's lives.  We can do the same with food safety with your help!


Risks & Challenges
Like every endeavor there are risks with what we are doing. It may take longer and more funding to get us to the field trials, out patents may be limited and after the field trials we may have to make additional changes to our system, in order to get it to market.
Our system is designed to be used by people with limited education and skill out in the fields, processing plants and warehouses.  By designing the testing system right, we will be able to train users in a matter of minutes and without a technical degree!  During my 30 years of industry experience, I have led teams who have done this before and we will leverage this experience and critical learning for our unique testing system. Our team has the skills to do this!


Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you aren't able to make a financial contribution to our campaign you can still help.  Let others know what we are doing and ask them to check us out and make a contribution to help us change bacteria testing to improve the health of the world! 
Don't forget to use all the Indiegogo share tools to make this happen.

  I am Mary Broadaway, an attorney, State Representative and most importantly the mother of a 23 year old son with autism.  When my son was a junior in high school it became apparent that he was not a candidate to be accepted into a traditional higher education environment.  There were very few alternatives for him after high school beyond attendance in a traditional day treatment program with a local disability service provider or a sheltered workshop.

What makes Building Better Futures Different Though there are some programs in the country that provide intellectually disabled individuals a  ""college like"" experience, there are very few that provide specialized, marketable, transferable employment skills such as culinary/hospitality, daycare, certified nursing assistant or coding in an integrated setting.  Institutions of higher education have not typically been equipped to serve this population, because these individuals often need greater support then their typical peers.  Thus, there has been a hesitance in higher education venues to establish such programs due to the expense.  This campaign is designed to build a fund-raising platform so that the seed-money can be raised to provide the necessary tools for institutions of higher education to create and implement the above described programs.  These programs fill a tremendous void by integrating intellectually disabled individuals  first, into the higher education environment and then, into mainstream society through competitive employment, thereby providing quality, dignity and a sense of contribution to them.

(Broadaway Family)  Building Better Futures is a WIN/ WIN


Integrated programs have proven to be as beneficial to typically developing individuals as to their intellectually disabled counterparts. The typically developing peers recognize the value, abilities and contributions that their intellectually disabled peers have and this creates the essential culture change necessary to the development of society. Due to the ever increasing number of individuals on the Autism Spectrum and developments in medical technology, there is a growing segment of our society that live with the challenges of intellectual disabilities and learning differences.  We must acknowledge these differences as a society and help these individuals find their place, provide them choice and opportunity, and enable them to contribute.

</h3><h3>Wateachu™ is a digital tool for working with non-digital exercises in the classroom</h3><p>Today's schools are the most modern and high-tech schools we have ever seen. Despite this, student achievements leaves a lot to be desired, especially in mathematics. </p><p>Different companies have come up with different products to improve education and some even offer digital workbooks with automatic correction of exercises. These can all be good and useful products but many schools don't have the resources, like one computer per student in the classroom, to fully implement such solutions.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470059652/BRUK1_Kopi_-_ED-DOWNSIZED_rniyoi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>With Wateachu we try to create a bridge between the digital and the non-digital. You and your students can continue working with the printed workbooks you already have without having to replace them with expensive software. At the same time we add a digital component with the Wateachu web app to enhance the way you already work. Wateachu is coded responsively, meaning that it will work well on both computers, tablets and smart phones. If your school can't afford a 1:1 device distrubution in the classroom but your students have their own smartphones with Internet access, then you're good to go!<br/><br/></p><h3>What does Wateachu do?</h3><p>There are some things Wateachu doesn't do and there are some things it does.</p><p>First, Wateachu doesn't contain exercises, it just refers to exercises by listing the different task numbers that are to be done, just like an ordinary plan on paper. However, being digital enables Wateachu to do things that a paper plan cannot. Here is what we try to do:</p><h4>Motivate students by visualizing progress</h4><p>Wateachu presents the list of exercises students are assigned to do as a chain of coloured circles, making the workload very visual and very concrete for the student. This is something that our student test users have given us positive feedback on and it looks like this: </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470059804/BRUK2-ED-DOWNSIZED_kdjnjf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Perhaps more importantly this visual layout also enables us to make it very clear to students whenever they have achieved or finished something. And that is motivating. Black circles are tasks to be done, once checked off as finished they turn green. It is almost like a game and both students and grown-ups know that checking off your to-do-lists feels good! <div><br/></div><div>In addition to all this, at the top of the screen we have included a statistics field where the student can see how many tasks have been completed, how many remains, how many percentages of the work plan is completed, how many times the student has asked for help and how many times the student has given help. Again to visualize progress and process with the aim of motivating the student.<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Give teachers better insight into how their students are doing by digitally logging non-digital student activity</h4>
<p>While students will hopefully get motivated by their user interface we hope teachers will gain a better understanding of their class by using their special teachers' interface.</p>
<p>This overview gives detailed information about how your students are working. Who have finished the most exercises? Who have needed help? What exercises are they working at right now? This is information that you can get almost at a glance. And if you hover your mouse marker above the symbols you will even get more information. Such as how long time has been spent on a specific exercise or who helped who with the exercise!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468785520/Teacher_overview_wqshrj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is valuable information for you as a teacher. Not as a replacement for interacting with your students, but as a help in being efficient and precise in your interactions. If, for example, you discover that John in the screenshot above is working on exercise no. 3 while everyone else is at no. 14 it would be wise to walk over to John first to check if he is doing ok, before walking over to all the other students that may perhaps be more active and outgoing in seeking your help. In this way Wateachu may help to level the playing field for all those students out there that may perhaps not be as extrovert as their peers.</p>
<p>(If on the other hand you see that John is 14 exercises in front of everyone else it would be wise to pay him a visit and see it he is cheating with what exercises he is checking off in Wateachu. Since Wateachu is a hybrid digital-non-digital system, students are able of cheating if they want to. However, we believe that an alert teacher and the system's built-in self-discipline will help keep your students on track. More on that later.)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470060110/BRUK-DOWNSIZED_nmccq3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>Logging student activity and presenting it for teacher analysis is nothing new. However very few products offer this for non-digital student activity. With Wateachu you can use digital technology to enhance the way you and your students work non-digitally. We believe in advancing education by the use of technology. But we also believe in the unique abilities of human beings to interact and help each other face to face. With Wateachu we try to bring together the best of both worlds.</span></p>
<h4>
<br/>Create an ecosystem of students turned teaching assistants where ""all for one, one for all"" is the team motto</h4>
<p>With Wateachu we want to create an improved social enviroment in the classroom. More than that, we want to change the way students look at their own performance and that of their peers and hopefully make this result in more and better learning.</p>
<div>In some classes, and even in some classes with a good social milieu, students see themselves and their performances as very seperate from that of their fellow students. This may perhaps be especially the case with mathematics where some students seem to always struggle while others seem to always excel. This is a challenge to the teacher since some students could need all the time available for getting help while at the same time others need more challenges. And all this often happens in a class of 20-30 students and often no more than one teacher.<p></p>
<p>With Wateachu we try to activate the resources of strong students to help the weaker students so that the class as a whole can benefit. On each task to be completed the student has the choice to either check it off as finished or to press an ""ask for help""-button. Asking for help will cause Wateachu's algorithms to find a fellow student who has previously completed the same task, and send a message to this student to come over and provide help face to face.**</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong students are challenged by having to help teach weaker students. This is something that all parties will most likely learn quite a bit from, both when it comes to getting a deeper understanding of the subject but also when it comes to training valuable cooperation skills.<br/><br/>

<h3>What is the history of Wateachu?</h3>
<div>Wateachu was created by Kristoffer Løset Øpstad, a Norwegian professional teacher and the founder of Creation Creates AS™, the company behind Wateachu. After having taught mathematics at different schools and using different methodologies over the last years, he felt that the time students spent solving exercises were not used as efficiently as it ought to be. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">When using a traditional ""teacher in front"" approach, the students spent much of the time listening to the teacher and looking at the blackboard. The remaining time was spent doing exercises, but often there was too little time and too many students to help for one teacher to handle.</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">When using a ""flipped classroom"" approach, the students spent their time at home watching videos explaining theory and most of the time in class was spent doing exercises. This gave the teacher more time to help individual students but still time could be scarce and often students found the time sitting solving exercises monotonous and not very motivating, again impairing efficiency and learning. <br/><br/></span>
</div>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470064437/BRUK_-_CUT_-_downsized_bbbuil.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>To improve the situation Løset Øpstad teamed up with three* computer engineers to create Wateachu, a digital tool for non-digital work. Originally the main goal was to make students interact more and help each other with tasks and exercises when needed, with the purpose of creating more learning and a more cooperative class culture. </p>
<p>After having several teachers test an early prototype in their respective high schools and after also having tested it in his own class at a junior high school, feedback suggested that the teachers really liked having a logging feature and that the students really liked the visual overview of the exercises and the ability to check them off and see their own progress.</p>
<div>As a result of this Wateachu has evolved into its current beta release where we try to motivate students, give teachers more insight in their classes, and help students help each other out, facilitating cooperation skills, team spirit and learning by both giving and receiving help.<br/><br/><p></p>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
<p>Wateachu was created by a professional teacher, not mainly to create a lot of money but to create a lot of learning and positive social change. This means that although we plan on offering Wateachu for a fee when we are ready to launch commercially at a later stage, we desire to keep the price reasonably low so that most schools, teachers and students can try it out and hopefully reap positive benefits from it.</p>
<p>We want you and your students to be able to test it out and see for yourself what you think about Wateachu. Our featured perk comes at only $ 35 USD and gives you a teacher-level access to the application for the remainer of the calendar year of 2016! For $ 35 you and all of your students can test out Wateachu and hopefully see positive and encouraging benefits from it. </p>

<p><br/>Also, whatever amount you chose to contribute to the product, and regardless of whether you are a teacher or not, you can be confident that by supporting Wateachu you are supporting a social entrepreneurial company that have their eyes more on serving people  than just earning money. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>Where will my money go if I support Wateachu?</h3>
<p>To create Wateachu we have had to ask private investors for help and we would like to give them back what they have initially given us. This is a ""boring"" thing to ask for support for, but being able to give back these funds will give us the freedom we need to go on developing Wateachu without having to wait for income from Wateachu license fees, etc.. For this reason we need approx. $ 25,000 USD.<br/><br/>Secondly, to be able to give support to you and other test users throughout the remainder of year 2016, and at the same time to be able to develop Wateachu further both in terms of marketing the product so that more people can try it out, but also in terms of adding new features and improving existing features, we need approx. $ 30,000 USD.***</p>
<div>If we get enough support we would like to consider adding the following features, among others:<br/><br/><div>
<ul>
<li><b>Support for more languages and countries. <br/><br/></b></li>
<li>
<b>Native apps for iPhone, Android phones and Windows phones.</b> This will enable us to message student helpers by the use of sound and vibration in addition to the visual signalling we are currently using. If will also enable the students' devices' screens to stay awake automatically, along with other features we have not currently been able of implementing.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>A new work plan creation feature</b> making it possible to mass import exercises from existing work plans in Word and other text documents.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>The possibility to export results</b> to Excel, PDF, etc.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>The possibility to automatically deliver reports to parents</b> of student progress, for example by e-mail once a week or once a plan has expired.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li><b>Integration with learning management platforms.</b></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Wateachu already has some great features but with your support we can make it even greater. We want the most schools, teachers and students to benefit from Wateachu and we need your help to make this happen.<br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","Wateachu™ is a digital tool for working with non-digital exercises in the classroomToday's schools are the most modern and high-tech schools we have ever seen. Despite this, student achievements leaves a lot to be desired, especially in mathematics. Different companies have come up with different products to improve education and some even offer digital workbooks with automatic correction of exercises. These can all be good and useful products but many schools don't have the resources, like one computer per student in the classroom, to fully implement such solutions.With Wateachu we try to create a bridge between the digital and the non-digital. You and your students can continue working with the printed workbooks you already have without having to replace them with expensive software. At the same time we add a digital component with the Wateachu web app to enhance the way you already work. Wateachu is coded responsively, meaning that it will work well on both computers, tablets and smart phones. If your school can't afford a 1:1 device distrubution in the classroom but your students have their own smartphones with Internet access, then you're good to go!What does Wateachu do?There are some things Wateachu doesn't do and there are some things it does.First, Wateachu doesn't contain exercises, it just refers to exercises by listing the different task numbers that are to be done, just like an ordinary plan on paper. However, being digital enables Wateachu to do things that a paper plan cannot. Here is what we try to do:Motivate students by visualizing progressWateachu presents the list of exercises students are assigned to do as a chain of coloured circles, making the workload very visual and very concrete for the student. This is something that our student test users have given us positive feedback on and it looks like this: Perhaps more importantly this visual layout also enables us to make it very clear to students whenever they have achieved or finished something. And that is motivating. Black circles are tasks to be done, once checked off as finished they turn green. It is almost like a game and both students and grown-ups know that checking off your to-do-lists feels good! In addition to all this, at the top of the screen we have included a statistics field where the student can see how many tasks have been completed, how many remains, how many percentages of the work plan is completed, how many times the student has asked for help and how many times the student has given help. Again to visualize progress and process with the aim of motivating the student.
Give teachers better insight into how their students are doing by digitally logging non-digital student activity
While students will hopefully get motivated by their user interface we hope teachers will gain a better understanding of their class by using their special teachers' interface.
This overview gives detailed information about how your students are working. Who have finished the most exercises? Who have needed help? What exercises are they working at right now? This is information that you can get almost at a glance. And if you hover your mouse marker above the symbols you will even get more information. Such as how long time has been spent on a specific exercise or who helped who with the exercise!

This is valuable information for you as a teacher. Not as a replacement for interacting with your students, but as a help in being efficient and precise in your interactions. If, for example, you discover that John in the screenshot above is working on exercise no. 3 while everyone else is at no. 14 it would be wise to walk over to John first to check if he is doing ok, before walking over to all the other students that may perhaps be more active and outgoing in seeking your help. In this way Wateachu may help to level the playing field for all those students out there that may perhaps not be as extrovert as their peers.
(If on the other hand you see that John is 14 exercises in front of everyone else it would be wise to pay him a visit and see it he is cheating with what exercises he is checking off in Wateachu. Since Wateachu is a hybrid digital-non-digital system, students are able of cheating if they want to. However, we believe that an alert teacher and the system's built-in self-discipline will help keep your students on track. More on that later.)

Logging student activity and presenting it for teacher analysis is nothing new. However very few products offer this for non-digital student activity. With Wateachu you can use digital technology to enhance the way you and your students work non-digitally. We believe in advancing education by the use of technology. But we also believe in the unique abilities of human beings to interact and help each other face to face. With Wateachu we try to bring together the best of both worlds.

Create an ecosystem of students turned teaching assistants where ""all for one, one for all"" is the team motto
With Wateachu we want to create an improved social enviroment in the classroom. More than that, we want to change the way students look at their own performance and that of their peers and hopefully make this result in more and better learning.
In some classes, and even in some classes with a good social milieu, students see themselves and their performances as very seperate from that of their fellow students. This may perhaps be especially the case with mathematics where some students seem to always struggle while others seem to always excel. This is a challenge to the teacher since some students could need all the time available for getting help while at the same time others need more challenges. And all this often happens in a class of 20-30 students and often no more than one teacher.
With Wateachu we try to activate the resources of strong students to help the weaker students so that the class as a whole can benefit. On each task to be completed the student has the choice to either check it off as finished or to press an ""ask for help""-button. Asking for help will cause Wateachu's algorithms to find a fellow student who has previously completed the same task, and send a message to this student to come over and provide help face to face.**

By making students teaching assistants in this way we believe that Wateachu has the potential to contribute to a number of positive changes in your classroom:

Strong students are challenged by having to help teach weaker students. This is something that all parties will most likely learn quite a bit from, both when it comes to getting a deeper understanding of the subject but also when it comes to training valuable cooperation skills.

Intermediate students can help weaker students and even weak students can help other students who have not gotten as far as themselves. Since exercises can belong to various difficulty levels and students work at different paces and also receive differing numbers of exercises according to differentiated work plans, a weak student may finish off an exercise before an intermediate student. Thus making it possible for weaker students to even help stronger students.


Since many students are receiving adequate help from fellow students, the teacher can get (a lot) more time to help those students that really need a teacher to help them.

Chances are that mocking someone in the break is a bit harder if that someone just helped you complete your math task in the past lesson five minutes ago. In this way we hope that Wateachu will contribute to a greater sense of team spirit and a better social environment in your class in addition to helping with learning subjects.

<h3><b>Why a nature based programme for teenage girls?</b></h3>
<p>Adolescence is an exciting stage of development for girls – full of new possibilities, great promises and potential. It’s a time for exploring and gaining an understanding of who we really are and who we want to be - a kind of stepping stone, from childhood to young adulthood.</p>
<p>As exciting as this transition can be, many girls experience it as a time of uneasy disconnection – from their childhood self, from their own transforming body and from others. And there's increasing evidence that in our current environment – with so much pressure to perform and conform coming from school, the media and online social platforms – it can be a time of anxiety and insecurity.</p>
<p>We have seen the enormous benefits that come from giving teenage girls some time out together in nature - away from all of those pressures. Time to have fun, learn new skills, renew their self-confidence and share experiences in a space where they feel supported by each other and by older female mentors.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p></p>
<p>The cost per person for this program is £950.</p>
<p>We very much would like to be able to offer bursary places to enable those on lower incomes a chance to take part. This campaign seeks funds to make this possible.</p>
<p>We're hoping to have a bursary fund of £2000, to be awarded on application by those who can not afford to pay the full price. Any funds raised will be used for bursaries.</p>
<p>Please give some money towards making this program more accessible and help young women to step forward in life on steady, supported ground.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Wild Time returns for 2016 - after an incredible first year. </p>
<p>After an amazing adventure with six girls and some inspiring feedback - we are launching again for this year!</p>

<i>We at Tahltan Language Conservation Initiative Project  believe that every child should have access to 
literature in their Native language - literature that stimulate their 
imagination and open their minds to new possibilities.</i><br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Tahltan Language Conservation Initiative Project</h3>Tahltan Language Conservation Initiative Project
(Hereon <b>TLCIP</b>) is a grassroots conservation effort that will focus on the preservation of the severely endangered
Tahltan language. There are only 17 fluent native Tahltan speakers alive today and all but two are over the age of seventy. The project
will work with the remaining speakers in an effort to digitally archive the
language in both audio and printed formats and in the process develop an online
and hard-copy complete dictionary in the Tahltan Language.<br/><br/>The Tahltan language is at risk of extinction within the next
few years unless vigorous preservation measures are taken. We have the local technical capacity to save our dying language, all that's needed is your financial contribution - your contribution will keep our language from disappearing from the face of humanity.<br/><br/><p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>How Will Your Money Be Used<br/>
</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>The Tahltan Language Conservation Initiative Project is seeking to raise 
$100,000 to work on the preservation of the Tahltan Language over a 2 
year period. The net proceeds from this campaign will enable us to launch a successful pilot project in the Tahltan Communities and allow us to archive the language and develop literature resources in the Tahltan Language. </p>
<p>The project will purchase
digital recording devices, computers, cameras, digital tablets and miscellaneous items (External
drives, discs etc.), but the majority of the funds would go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>fieldwork and technical support (digital recordings)<br/>
</li>
<li>archiving
the language (audio and printed versions)<br/>
</li>
<li>digital
resources (literature/dictionary) development. 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>The project will consist of three phases:<br/></p>
<p><b>First
Phase:</b> will continue recording the last remaining native speakers of the
Tahltan language and archive the digital data.<br/></p>
<p><b>Second Phase:</b> will develop and publish an online and hard-copy dictionary in Tahltan and English that would be
available to anyone interested in studying the language. (We will archive our language in print and digital formats).<br/></p>
<p><b>Third Phases:</b> will make available through retail the hard-copy
dictionary and all proceeds will go back to the development of resource
material in the Tahltan Language.
</p>
<p>The
first and second phase will overlap and the development of a hard-copy and digital dictionary
will commence as soon as the funds are raised to begin the field and technical work. The
dictionary will be a major part of the conservation or archiving process and the dictionary layout design can be used as a template for other endangered Dene Languages.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Language is an essential component in the development of an individuals identity and ethnicity, but many
Tahltan Children do not have access to the Tahltan language or material 
that
inspires a lifelong opportunity to learn to speak Tahltan. The first 11 years of a 
child’s life
are the most important for language development, but there are no language literature resources
available for the children apart from the 
recently
published interactive digital eBook; <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/talkin-tahltan/id1055985848?mt=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Talkin' Tahltan: The Pedagogical Structure Of The Tāłtān Dene Language</a> (Oscar Dennis 2015). The only other material available is an
incomplete very limited unpublished children’s Illustrated Dictionary,
developed in 1991, that is very difficult for the average family 
(especially in
urban areas) to obtain. <b>TLCIP </b>will use modern technology to preserve the language and in the process develop a digital interactive resource(s) that would enable the Tahltan people to attain the most essential of
life experiences – the magic and blessing of speaking their Indigenous
language. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Support The Concept </h3>
<p>Our
resident local First Nations tech team, i.e., researchers and resource
developers, speak the language and have deep experience in qualitative research
methodologies and digital resource development, as well as close relationships
with two of the last high-level speakers of the
Tahltan language in the Iskut community. Our tech
team also has extensive experience in the language revitalization, interactive eBook development and the online
publishing realm. We have the human resource capacity to save the Tahltan
language all that’s needed are the
funds to make this a reality.</p>

<p>Team Leader Oscar Dennis Sr has a Masters Degree in First Nations Studies and a BA In Anthropology. Oscar has been working on the conservation of the Tahltan Language For over 5 Years. As a result he is one of the few who has learned to speak the language as a second language. Along with father James Dennis, Oscar Dennis has published a book on the <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/talkin-tahltan/id1055985848?mt=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pedagogical Structure of the Tahltan Language</a>.

<p>Team member Robert Dennis is the youngest fluent native Tahltan language speaker left in the Tahltan Nation. Robert was the last to learn to speak Tahltan as a child. Robert will bring his expertise of the language and his computer skills to the project. Robert has been studying the Korean Language for over 3 years and has developed some mad language skills.

James grew-up on Tahltan land as a nomadic hunter and spoke Tahltan as a child. Although he learned English as a child he only spoke English when it was required of him. James will be bringing his extensive knowledge of the Tahltan language to the project. James is the eldest living male Wolf Clan-member alive today in the Tahltan Nation and he speaks the language fluently.<br/><br/><br/><h3>What Have We Done So Far?</h3>The interactive eBook, Talkin' Tahltan was written over a 4 yr period in which team leader Oscar Dennis Sr studied the Tahltan Language in the Tahltan community of Iskut with his father James Dennis - James is one of the last fluent native speakers left in the Tahltan Nation. The interactive eBook, 'Talkin' Tahltan' can be viewed on iTunes: <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/talkin-tahltan/id1055985848?mt=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/talkin-tahltan...</a><br/><br/>We have an interactive website dedicated to teaching the Tahltan Language: <a href=""http://didenekeh.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://didenekeh.com</a><br/><br/>We have a Facebook Page dedicated to teaching the language through social media: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/348038428639638/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/348038428639638/</a><br/><br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The greatest challenge to the conservation of the endangered Tahltan Language is the continuous direct access to the high level fluent native speakers in the Tahltan communities. However, the team is made up of two fluent native speakers and a second language speaker. Also, two of the team-members have direct-access (24/7) to elderly parents who learned the language as children. There is no challenge that we cannot over come. The only challenge we face is financial - we need financial support to make this conservation initiative project a reality. Your contribution will help us over-come the challenge of our dying language.</p>
<p>So please donate what you can $5, $10, $50, $100, $500, $1000, $10,000, $20,000 or more.</p>
<p>Our language is worth saving!<br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>What Is The Legacy<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
dictionary will make the language readily available to the children on mobile
devices that can be accessed in the classroom, at home and in the field.</p>
<p>The written
and digital audio data will be digitally archived and readily available for
use in other creative ways to develop reading resources that will be suitable
for children of all ages.<br/></p>
<p>Once we
get this project off the ground we can apply the knowledge gained (model) to other
endangered Dene languages (Kaska and Tagish etc.,).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some of you just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul> <li>Those of you who can not contribute financially you can help by getting the word out and make some noise about our campaign to save our endangered language.

The project will consist of three phases:
First
Phase: will continue recording the last remaining native speakers of the
Tahltan language and archive the digital data.
Second Phase: will develop and publish an online and hard-copy dictionary in Tahltan and English that would be
available to anyone interested in studying the language. (We will archive our language in print and digital formats).
Third Phases: will make available through retail the hard-copy
dictionary and all proceeds will go back to the development of resource
material in the Tahltan Language.

The
first and second phase will overlap and the development of a hard-copy and digital dictionary
will commence as soon as the funds are raised to begin the field and technical work. The
dictionary will be a major part of the conservation or archiving process and the dictionary layout design can be used as a template for other endangered Dene Languages.

  The Impact Language is an essential component in the development of an individuals identity and ethnicity, but many
Tahltan Children do not have access to the Tahltan language or material 
that
inspires a lifelong opportunity to learn to speak Tahltan. The first 11 years of a 
child’s life
are the most important for language development, but there are no language literature resources
available for the children apart from the 
recently
published interactive digital eBook; Talkin' Tahltan: The Pedagogical Structure Of The Tāłtān Dene Language (Oscar Dennis 2015). The only other material available is an
incomplete very limited unpublished children’s Illustrated Dictionary,
developed in 1991, that is very difficult for the average family 
(especially in
urban areas) to obtain. TLCIP will use modern technology to preserve the language and in the process develop a digital interactive resource(s) that would enable the Tahltan people to attain the most essential of
life experiences – the magic and blessing of speaking their Indigenous
language. 




Why Support The Concept 
Our
resident local First Nations tech team, i.e., researchers and resource
developers, speak the language and have deep experience in qualitative research
methodologies and digital resource development, as well as close relationships
with two of the last high-level speakers of the
Tahltan language in the Iskut community. Our tech
team also has extensive experience in the language revitalization, interactive eBook development and the online
publishing realm. We have the human resource capacity to save the Tahltan
language all that’s needed are the
funds to make this a reality.


Our Research & Resource Development Team 

    Oscar James Dennis Sr
Team Leader Oscar Dennis Sr has a Masters Degree in First Nations Studies and a BA In Anthropology. Oscar has been working on the conservation of the Tahltan Language For over 5 Years. As a result he is one of the few who has learned to speak the language as a second language. Along with father James Dennis, Oscar Dennis has published a book on the Pedagogical Structure of the Tahltan Language. Oscar has advanced language and computer technical research skills that he will be bringing to the project. Oscar also has direct access to a fluent high-level Tahltan native speaker in his home 24/7.



    Robert Leon Dennis
Team member Robert Dennis is the youngest fluent native Tahltan language speaker left in the Tahltan Nation. Robert was the last to learn to speak Tahltan as a child. Robert will bring his expertise of the language and his computer skills to the project. Robert has been studying the Korean Language for over 3 years and has developed some mad language skills. Robert also has direct access to a high-level native Tahltan speaker in his home 24/7.
    James William DennisJames Dennis is the 81 Year old Elder on the Team. James grew-up on Tahltan land as a nomadic hunter and spoke Tahltan as a child. Although he learned English as a child he only spoke English when it was required of him. James will be bringing his extensive knowledge of the Tahltan language to the project. James is the eldest living male Wolf Clan-member alive today in the Tahltan Nation and he speaks the language fluently.What Have We Done So Far?The interactive eBook, Talkin' Tahltan was written over a 4 yr period in which team leader Oscar Dennis Sr studied the Tahltan Language in the Tahltan community of Iskut with his father James Dennis - James is one of the last fluent native speakers left in the Tahltan Nation. The interactive eBook, 'Talkin' Tahltan' can be viewed on iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/ca/book/talkin-tahltan...We have an interactive website dedicated to teaching the Tahltan Language: http://didenekeh.comWe have a Facebook Page dedicated to teaching the language through social media: https://www.facebook.com/groups/348038428639638/
  Risks & Challenges The greatest challenge to the conservation of the endangered Tahltan Language is the continuous direct access to the high level fluent native speakers in the Tahltan communities. However, the team is made up of two fluent native speakers and a second language speaker. Also, two of the team-members have direct-access (24/7) to elderly parents who learned the language as children. There is no challenge that we cannot over come. The only challenge we face is financial - we need financial support to make this conservation initiative project a reality. Your contribution will help us over-come the challenge of our dying language.
So please donate what you can $5, $10, $50, $100, $500, $1000, $10,000, $20,000 or more.
Our language is worth saving!


What Is The Legacy



The
dictionary will make the language readily available to the children on mobile
devices that can be accessed in the classroom, at home and in the field.
The written
and digital audio data will be digitally archived and readily available for
use in other creative ways to develop reading resources that will be suitable
for children of all ages.
Once we
get this project off the ground we can apply the knowledge gained (model) to other
endangered Dene languages (Kaska and Tagish etc.,).

  Other Ways You Can Help Some of you just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Those of you who can not contribute financially you can help by getting the word out and make some noise about our campaign to save our endangered language.

<div><b>Ladle Casting Furnace: $10,000</b></div>
</div><div>Ladle casting is a dynamic process where objects are pressed into sand and then removed, creating impressions of the design in the sand. Molten glass is then ladled into the impression, creating a cast glass version of the design. We will be fabricating the furnace for this process on site in the new studio. This furnace will also enable us to mix custom colors of glass for kiln casting and ladle casting. In order for us to build this furnace (which will contain 600lbs of molten glass when finished) we will need to purchase:</div><div> </div><div>

</div></div>","We're moving our glass studio...After two successful years of classes, consulting, and custom fabrication, we’ve found a great new location where we can focus on larger scale fabrication projects. We're excited to expand our offerings to include cold working (cutting, grinding, and polishing glass) and hot glass (ladle casting, blow molds, and glass blowing), as well as new equipment for creating architectural components and printmaking.Your support will help us put in important new infrastructure – a casting furnace, kiln controller, and portable press – and make our studio transition happen more efficiently!   ....And creating the ""IV fab lab""!Our goal as teachers and collaborators is to help find the most compelling form for an idea – ​whether it’s our own, our students, or our clients.  Expanding our repertoire of equipment will literally give us the tools to make that happen; we’ll be able to move seamlessly between cold-working, hot glass, and kiln-forming, adapting working methods to best create the project at hand. Why the move?Our previous space came under new management, and we were forced to look for a new location. We've created this campaign to help us acquire important new infrastructure for our new space and make our studio transition happen more efficiently.We’re excited to bring this multi-use facility to life for the Bay Area glass community, and to have our own venue where we can share our knowledge and enthusiasm for glass in all its forms.Check out our NEW website at www.fourfab.com! 
 
So, how will we use your $$?
Your contribution will enable us to build a casting furnace for ladle casting glass, buy a special controller for our kilns, buy a portable press, and assist with the costs of studio relocation. 
 
Given the recent shortages in kiln glass manufacturing, this furnace will be especially critical as it will enable us to create our own custom glass for projects.
 

 
Ladle Casting Furnace: $10,000
Ladle casting is a dynamic process where objects are pressed into sand and then removed, creating impressions of the design in the sand. Molten glass is then ladled into the impression, creating a cast glass version of the design. We will be fabricating the furnace for this process on site in the new studio. This furnace will also enable us to mix custom colors of glass for kiln casting and ladle casting. In order for us to build this furnace (which will contain 600lbs of molten glass when finished) we will need to purchase: 

$2000 in refractory ( IFB, FB, fiberfrax, rammable ) 
$6000 in power supply, controls, and elements ( transformer, SCR package, wiring, Molybdenum elements, Hi/Lo controller, thermocouples ) 
$2000 in metal and hardware

 

 
GB5 Controller Setup: $5000

This controller will enable us to simultaneously run all five kilns at the same time, and make our electrical use more efficient by staggering power usage. We’ll also be able to program via computer, and easily print out precise records of our firing schedules. This is critical for our ability to undertake multi-part projects which require multiple kilns and meticulous record keeping. To accomplish this rewiring project we will need:

Digitry Controller with 5 sending units 
PC graphing & program manipulation software 
Advanced Power Sharing Model
Surge suppressor 
Thermocouples type K (5) 
Main nema enclosure 
Relay enclosures (5) 
Relays (5 mercury relay switches)  
Power Distribution Blocks for Kilns  (5) 
Power distribution block for gb & CV  
Unistrut & hardware 
soow  cable 6/3  ( 20 ft ) 
soow  cable  8/3 ( 20 ft )  
sjoow cable  18/2 (100 ft )  
240v indicator lights  

​


 
Portable Printing Press and Accessories: $1000

A portable table top printing press will enable us to teach printmaking in our studio (as well as at other locations) and expand our repertoire of art and design. We've found printmaking on paper to be a wonderful accompaniment to printmaking on glass, and are excited at the prospect of incorporating print processes into our studio! (Photo from Carrie's Hauberg residency at Pilchuck Glass School!)

 


$650 for portable table top press
$50 for press blankets
$300 for ink and printing supplies

***All additional funds raised will go toward the cost of setting up and maintaining the studio. THANK YOU!!***
 

 
What YOU get... i.e. the ""Perks!""
We've put together a fun assortment of perks – ladle cast glass tiles, handblown ornaments, handmade prints, classes, and a ladle casting PARTY – all of which will provide invaluable support for our studio! We'll be sharing more photos of the available perks throughout the campaign in the gallery at the top of the page–  please check back for more information and details! 
 

Ok, Sign me up! How can I help?

<p><i>Donate
to support a new espresso bar, specializing in single origin coffee &amp; offering the homeless a Second Shot</i></p>
<p><b>My
Story:</b></p>
<p>Hello, and thank you for taking the time to
read about my crowdfund campaign! My name is Julian Corbett, and I am here to
introduce to you my campaign to fund not just a new business venture but also a social enterprise project. </p><p>To give you some
background on my experience, I am most well-known for creating the name
Cheesecake Charlie, and successfully taking a small artisan home-based idea
specializing in cheesecakes, and turning it into a successful enterprise that
supplied small beautiful cheesecake creations to wholesale markets and
individual food outlets.<span>  I then found
love and decided to start a new life here with my Australian Wife.</span></p>
<p>I am a classically trained chef, catering
manager, Barista and more!</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451304914/ndorfr6p14az7bb8nl9w.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Since writing and self-publishing the first
in my “Cheesecakeology” series, I have decided to expand on my passion for
delicious food and one-of-a-kind single origin coffee beverages. I want to take
my experiences in building my own dessert business and transfer the knowledge
and creativity to running an espresso bar that makes its own single origin
coffee blend, which is difficult to find our area.<div> 
<p><b>The
Project:</b></p>
<p>This project has taken on a much deeper
meaning and serious nature, from being just another coffee shop or espresso
bar idea, to also wanting to make a difference to homelessness in Perth and perhaps extending this out to other cities in Australia. This project is due to the experiences that my wife has shared with me and many
conversations with some beautiful Australian people that I’ve met since
arriving in Australia.</p>
<p>Homelessness is a problem that could effect us all and unemployment is one of the biggest causes, so we would like to do our part in giving people a second shot.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>What makes us a
little different from your regular coffee shop or espresso bar is that we are a
social enterprise, set up not only to develop a coffee brand through flavour profiling but also to help local homeless people in
our community get a second shot. Our goal is to provide expert training, offer a job in the business for up to 6 months and help with housing all of which will hopefully be a stepping stone to long term
employment and regaining some pride, dignity and self-confidence.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450922307/docsxvpi7cvbxlxqcdoy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>To begin this process we need to purchase a
former shipping container, with the ultimate goal of converting it into a new
Espresso Bar and finding a permanent home in the newly redeveloped waterfront
area of Perth, Australia. This massive project has been divided up into three
phases:</p>
<p><b>Phase One: </b>Purchasing the
shipping container and redesigning it so it can be ready to be made into the
espresso bar.</p>
<p><b>Phase Two: </b>Purchasing a further two shipping containers and performing another conversion to build seating
modules, making the espresso bar a sit-down coffee house.  This will create both an indoor and alfresco seating area for our customers.</p>
<p><b>Phase Three:</b> Purchasing
one last shipping container, and converting this one into an in-house roasting
room, profiling lab and tasting room.  This will allow us to begin creating our very own single origin coffee blend based on flavour profiling which is a new direction for coffee nerds.</p>
<p>As our project gathers momentum we will be looking to partner up with local organisations to better promote the project and open up further opportunities that can only benefit in the long term</p>
<p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451345568/dgjkw3z0flub978arjig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>This project is not just a labor of love,
but concepts like this are not just vital to the redevelopment of our area but should offer a sense of hope to those individuals whom might not have any. Perth's water front area is in the process of a massive
revitalization, and needs creative businesses with new ideas to bring life
back into the area. By using the unique idea of converting shipping containers
into usable space, and bringing to the table flavour profiling to single origin
coffee blend that we will make and sell in-house, we believe we have the right
combination to make a difference in the area.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</div><div>
<p>I am also personally very emotionally
invested in the idea of supporting growers of single origin coffee beans, and
want to do everything I can to back them up in their efforts. By using only
single origin coffee beans in our espresso bar and purchasing directly from these growers, we are financially supporting
these dedicated growers and giving them the ability to sustain their own businesses, while
providing a different option to coffee drinkers who may be unfamiliar with the
movement supporting single origin coffee and flavour profiling. We can provide their first experience

to support a new espresso bar, specializing in single origin coffee & offering the homeless a Second Shot
My
Story:
Hello, and thank you for taking the time to
read about my crowdfund campaign! My name is Julian Corbett, and I am here to
introduce to you my campaign to fund not just a new business venture but also a social enterprise project. To give you some
background on my experience, I am most well-known for creating the name
Cheesecake Charlie, and successfully taking a small artisan home-based idea
specializing in cheesecakes, and turning it into a successful enterprise that
supplied small beautiful cheesecake creations to wholesale markets and
individual food outlets.  I then found
love and decided to start a new life here with my Australian Wife.
I am a classically trained chef, catering
manager, Barista and more!
Since writing and self-publishing the first
in my “Cheesecakeology” series, I have decided to expand on my passion for
delicious food and one-of-a-kind single origin coffee beverages. I want to take
my experiences in building my own dessert business and transfer the knowledge
and creativity to running an espresso bar that makes its own single origin
coffee blend, which is difficult to find our area. 
The
Project:
This project has taken on a much deeper
meaning and serious nature, from being just another coffee shop or espresso
bar idea, to also wanting to make a difference to homelessness in Perth and perhaps extending this out to other cities in Australia. This project is due to the experiences that my wife has shared with me and many
conversations with some beautiful Australian people that I’ve met since
arriving in Australia.
Homelessness is a problem that could effect us all and unemployment is one of the biggest causes, so we would like to do our part in giving people a second shot.


What makes us a
little different from your regular coffee shop or espresso bar is that we are a
social enterprise, set up not only to develop a coffee brand through flavour profiling but also to help local homeless people in
our community get a second shot. Our goal is to provide expert training, offer a job in the business for up to 6 months and help with housing all of which will hopefully be a stepping stone to long term
employment and regaining some pride, dignity and self-confidence.




To begin this process we need to purchase a
former shipping container, with the ultimate goal of converting it into a new
Espresso Bar and finding a permanent home in the newly redeveloped waterfront
area of Perth, Australia. This massive project has been divided up into three
phases:
Phase One: Purchasing the
shipping container and redesigning it so it can be ready to be made into the
espresso bar.
Phase Two: Purchasing a further two shipping containers and performing another conversion to build seating
modules, making the espresso bar a sit-down coffee house.  This will create both an indoor and alfresco seating area for our customers.
Phase Three: Purchasing
one last shipping container, and converting this one into an in-house roasting
room, profiling lab and tasting room.  This will allow us to begin creating our very own single origin coffee blend based on flavour profiling which is a new direction for coffee nerds.
As our project gathers momentum we will be looking to partner up with local organisations to better promote the project and open up further opportunities that can only benefit in the long term
Impact:



This project is not just a labor of love,
but concepts like this are not just vital to the redevelopment of our area but should offer a sense of hope to those individuals whom might not have any. Perth's water front area is in the process of a massive
revitalization, and needs creative businesses with new ideas to bring life
back into the area. By using the unique idea of converting shipping containers
into usable space, and bringing to the table flavour profiling to single origin
coffee blend that we will make and sell in-house, we believe we have the right
combination to make a difference in the area. 

I am also personally very emotionally
invested in the idea of supporting growers of single origin coffee beans, and
want to do everything I can to back them up in their efforts. By using only
single origin coffee beans in our espresso bar and purchasing directly from these growers, we are financially supporting
these dedicated growers and giving them the ability to sustain their own businesses, while
providing a different option to coffee drinkers who may be unfamiliar with the
movement supporting single origin coffee and flavour profiling. We can provide their first experience
and educate them at the same time. 
Your donations can help us fast-track our
project and begin renovations! As soon as we reach our funding goal, we can
move through Phase One and begin marketing our new location to the Perth metro
area!

For this first crowdfund campaign, we are
seeking funding in the amount of $20,000 (AUS). 
We will use the money raised to help launch “Phase One” of our project.

<p>Why is research in arts education so important?  Because without solid research, educational authorities who are committed to evidence based decision making will find it difficult to commit valuable resources to learning in the arts.  Because improving quality in arts education requires in-depth study of the practice of exemplary teachers.  Because only through research will we know where the arts are being taught in the world, by whom, and with what resources.  Because all young people have a right to explore their cultural heritage and to exercise their creativity.

We need 5000 Euros to cover the cost of publication for the 2016 edition of the INRAE Yearbook and to meet the related demands of this fundraising campaign.We will proudly acknowledge your donation by publicly recognizing you in the 2016 Yearbook and on our website.  We will be very grateful for all donations ranging from 10 Euros (Friend) to 500 Euros (Champion) and beyond.  In addition, for every donation of  50 Euros or more, it will give us great pleasure to send you a copy of the 2016 International Yearbook for Research in Arts Education, as soon as it is published!  If you make multiple donations of 50 Euros or more, we will send you multiple copies of the Yearbook!Impact


This is the first time that we are raising funds for the |INRAE Yearbook through crowdfunding and we are very excited about the possibility of using this platform to enable us to publish research in our field.
Why is research in arts education so important?  Because without solid research, educational authorities who are committed to evidence based decision making will find it difficult to commit valuable resources to learning in the arts.  Because improving quality in arts education requires in-depth study of the practice of exemplary teachers.  Because only through research will we know where the arts are being taught in the world, by whom, and with what resources.  Because all young people have a right to explore their cultural heritage and to exercise their creativity. Research has a major role to play in making high quality arts education accessible to all children and youth.    Risks & ChallengesThe articles have been written.  The editing is well underway.  The Yearbook will be ready for the publisher very soon.  So, the only risk is that we may not reach our fundraising goal.  If this should happen, we will make every effort to find other ways to supplement your donations so that the Yearbook can see the light of day.  We have succeeded in publishing 3 previous Yearbooks, so we are confident that, with your backing, we will succeed again, this time.
  Other Ways You Can HelpPlease help us to get the word out about this campaign.  Tell your friends and colleagues.  Circulate information through your networks.  Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Well, you've just found it!
Get one of our kits, fetch your soldering iron and start.
This project is very simple Atmel ATtiny85 microcontroller board that comes in parts, as a kit, so you can solder it yourself and then program it.

It is Arduino compatible which means you can program it with the familiar Arduino IDE interface.


Perfect for beginners - everything is so simple that there is almost nothing that you can get wrong.


Best startup kit for teachers and educators.

All the designs and source code are released under OPEN SOURCE licenses so you can use them, make modifications and share them freely.
Tinusaur, what's that?
This is the name of our project – Tinusaur.It's a long story but in short – we started it around October 2013 as a prototyping board that we wanted to use to quickly build things with Atmel ATtiny85 microcontrollers and since then it had grown into a full-fledged project with a small but devoted community around it.It consists of the following sub-projects:
 
The Tinusaur boards and the shields. This is the hardware. 	Everything comes in parts, i.e. it is a kit and you have to assemble 	it yourself 

The step-by-step user guides how to assemble the boards. 	These are the video tutorials that we're preparing. 

Beginners tutorials for how to write your first 	microcontroller programs. Blinking LED, reading push button, 	sensors, etc. 

Cool projects using the Tinusaur boards and shields. These 	are things that really do stuff for you like thermostats, 	variometers, etc. Those are of hardware and software.


Why we need your support?
Over the past 2 years, we have managed to ship few hundreds of our kits to people all over the world. But it is more often that the demand is larger than the quantities we could supply.
We need to move this project to next level being able to keep
quantities in stock as well as develop more boards, more shields,
complete video guides, write more tutorials and make this project
even greater.
Get your own Tinusaur kit and, help us fund this project.What others are saying about us

Microcontroller is DIP socketed so it can be replaced with other tiny micros like Attiny25/45 and 85 and their variations.




ATmega32 AVRThe Tinusaur Projecthttp://atmega32-avr.com/the-tinusaur-project/The Tinusaur is a small board with a ATtiny85 micro-controller on it. 



Still not convinced?
Here is more information about our project.
The Tinusaur Board is partially Arduino compatible and it could be programmed using the Arduino development environment.
What could you learn?
It is very simple. In fact, it is so simple that there are few thing you can get wrong.
It allows enthusiasts to learn many things:
 
Learn how to solder components on a PCB board by following 	step-by-step video tutorials. 

Learn the basic principles of microcontroller programming 	in C/C++. 

Learn how to write simple programs to turn on and off an LED 	but also, write a bit more complicated programs that read external 	signals.


What else could you do with it?
Simple things like blinking LED, experimenting with push-buttons, photo-resistors, buzzers, etc. But also, connect some external sensors for temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure or connect external devices like relays.

<br/><b>SVENSKA</b><p>Varje dag träffas hundratusentals människor i Sverige, socialt, för att konsumera cannabis och snacka skit, precis som när man går på fika eller tar en drink tillsammans med några vänner.

<h3>Vad behöver vi er hjälp med?</h3>
<p>Det vore en underdrift att påstå att publiken för den här showen inte finns. Det enda krav vi har är att göra ett bra jobb och det är därför vi ber om er hjälp. 50 000 kronor (€5000) är det minsta vi kommer behöva för att kunna fullfölja det här projektet till den kapaciteten vi önskar. Om man kanske inte är van vid filmproduktion så kan det låta mycket. Men det rör sig om hundratals timmars av arbete före, under och efter inspelning, för fem personer. <br/><br/>Wally Johnson kommer göra det här pro-bono men då hans produktionsteam har heltidsjobb som de måste ta ledigt ifrån för att kunna spela in showen så blir det svårt att inte erbjuda de något för förlorad arbetstid. <br/><br/>- 20 000 kronor, symboliskt arvode för produktionsteamet för 10 dagars arbete. Teamet består utav en kameraman, ljudtekniker och produktionsassistent/koordinator samt en co-host.<br/><br/>- 8 000 kronor, lokalhyra för 8 dagars inspelning.</p>
<p>- 7000 kronor, transport, mat, produktionskostnader för gäster, produktionsteam mm.<br/><br/>- 5000 kronor, post production. Redigering, ljudmixning, färgkorrigering mm. </p>
<p>- 5000 kronor, NormaliseraMera.se hemsida + marknadsföring utav podden<br/>- 5000 kronor, oförutsedda utgifter som man kommer på under processens gång.<br/><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">April 2016 väntas avsnitten spelas in och intentionen är att det ska sändas i Maj/Juni tillsammans med lansering av hemsidan.</span><br/><br/> </p> <p> </p>
<h3>Perks för både privatpersoner och företag. </h3>
<p>Som ni ser till höger om sidan så har vi massor av roliga perks till de som väljer att crowdfunda oss. Vi har gjort så det finns något för alla i alla priskategorier.<br/><br/>Även företag som vill synas i showen kan välja att stödja projektet och få exponering samtidigt. Vi har räknat konservativt att varje avsnitt har som pontential att dra minst 40-50 000 views. Det är väldigt konservativt räknat. Varje avsnitt kommer förmodligen få 100 000 + views, baserat på  vårt extensiva nätverk, marknadsföring, media exponering och utländsk publik.<br/><br/>Med er hjälp kan vi göra produktionen så välgjord som möjligt och kanske om allt går bra, så blir det en andra säsong. Skriv till oss om det skulle vara någon speciell deal du är ute efter utöver det som är listat . Vi är flexibla och kreativa!</p>

<p><b>#FiredUpForLiteracy Campaign Summary</b></p>
<p>Chicago has one of the lowest adult literacy rates in the
country at 53%. 
Falling behind and losing confidence begins at an early age.  Reading In Motion’s mission is to get every
student reading at grade level by the end of first grade.  Research supports that reading at grade level
by the end of first grade puts kids on a more successful path to high school
graduation, helping them avoid incarceration, unemployment and poverty as an
adult. </p>
<p><i>As a nonprofit, we
have the ability to raise financial support to make innovation happen in schools, even in
the midst of turbulence. </i>This campaign goal of $100,000 is aimed at
supporting our effective literacy program in schools around the city, amid Chicago
Public Schools (CPS) and Illinois state budget issues that can diminish focus
on the students.  Your gift will support
our literacy program in eight specific Chicago public schools.</p>
<p>YOUR IMPACT</p>
<p>Research says, if a student is NOT reading at grade level by the end of 1st
grade, they face a high risk of not graduating from high school, resulting in:<br/></p>
<ul><li>85%
likelihood to get in trouble with the law</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>50%
likelihood to get caught up in substance abuse</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>3
times more likely to be unemployed</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span>6 times
more likely to live in poverty</li></ul>
<p>Currently, 82% of Reading In Motion students reach
grade-level reading compared to the overall CPS average of 61% in kindergarten
and first grade.  The impact is profound
and lasting:</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span><i>Kids loving to learn and loving to read</i>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span><i>A significant increase in kids reading at
grade-level</i>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span><i>A brighter path for a brighter future for
these students and our community</i>
</li></ul>
<p></p>

cause based on your level of support!</p>

<p><b>Risks and Challenges: Join Our Effort to Get The Word Out<br/></b></p>
<p>Reading In Motion has a limited network of individuals to
reach out to for support.  A majority of
funding comes from foundation grants, followed by corporate giving.  We built our strategy for this campaign to compensate
for this limitation.  You can be a part
of its success!  Watch a video on social media, posted with #FiredUpForLiteracy that mentions our campaign and see what we are talking about.<br/></p>
<p>Over 50 volunteer spokespeople have been recruited to get
the word out to their own networks. David Eigenberg, Kara Kilmer, Miranda Rae
Mayo, Kurt Ehrmann and Robyn Coffin of “Chicago Fire”, Antione McKay and Sara Sevigny of
“Empire”, Donald Faison of “Scrubs”, Tim Kazurinsky of
""Police Academy &amp; SNL"", Tony Award winner, Jessie Meuller, starring in the
Broadway musical ""Waitress"" and the touring cast of “Jersey Boys”
have joined a respected group of Chicago actors, musicians and teachers including
Steppenwolf ensemble members, James Vincent Meredith and Francis Guinan in
sharing short videos highlighting the importance of reading in their own lives
and careers as well as sharing what they are reading.</p>

<p><b>Campaign Details -
$100,000 Supporting Literacy for Chicago Kids</b></p>
<p>Typically Reading In Motion requires the school to invest in
25% of the cost of the program to help strengthen the school’s commitment to
successful implementation and 75% is covered by donors. However, the
uncertainty of the CPS and Illinois state budgets make it challenging for
schools to try innovative solutions. The #FiredUpForLiteracy campaign has a
$100,000 goal to support 100% of the cost of the program in a select number of
schools that have never tried Reading In Motion before.  Experiencing the results will shape how they decide
to invest in their students the following year.</p>
