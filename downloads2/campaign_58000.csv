Thank you for your interest in Just Been Tested, also known as JBT Foundation, Inc.(JBT). 
We believe the current approach to STD testing is outdated, as far too many people are left crippled in fear of the perceived stigma surrounding the testing experience.  
Just Been Tested shatters that mindset and enables you to celebrate and get rewarded for your decision to get tested.



                                       


The Problem 


According to the CDC, 9.5 million new sexually transmitted disease cases affect those aged 15-24 annually. 

By age 25, one of two sexually active persons will acquire a sexually transmitted disease.

JBT helps reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (specifically HIV) by popularizing the practice of getting tested.

But they can also choose to share their latest vacation photos while sharing the latest music gossip, fashion or sports news. Whatever they decide, it's all at their fingertips and in a safe, nonjudgmental environment. 
JBT members can also seek private or public answers to any questions regarding sexual and reproductive health from some of our online certified health experts.

<h1>
<br/>How golftripsNOW came about<br/><br/>
</h1>
<p>It all started with <a href=""http://golfboo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">golfboo.com</a>, the extremely successful golf travel comparison website for the European marketplace. We have worked with many golf travel companies over the years and while watching the trends in the US we felt that something key was missing. So, we partnered with a US based team to develop the ultimate travel website for golfers and simplify the process of planning and booking their golf trips to Orlando, Myrtle Beach, Miami, Scottsdale, Vegas and many more.</p>
<p>The non-existence of a golf travel website that provides a complete and time saving solution for the golfer led us to develop this new and exciting concept. With over 40 years combined experience between the Executive Team at <a href=""http://golftripsnow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">golftripsNOW</a> we looked at the facts and have been determined to come up with a solution for you. And, what a solution we have!</p>

How golftripsNOW came about

It all started with golfboo.com, the extremely successful golf travel comparison website for the European marketplace. We have worked with many golf travel companies over the years and while watching the trends in the US we felt that something key was missing. So, we partnered with a US based team to develop the ultimate travel website for golfers and simplify the process of planning and booking their golf trips to Orlando, Myrtle Beach, Miami, Scottsdale, Vegas and many more.
The non-existence of a golf travel website that provides a complete and time saving solution for the golfer led us to develop this new and exciting concept. With over 40 years combined experience between the Executive Team at golftripsNOW we looked at the facts and have been determined to come up with a solution for you. And, what a solution we have!
We designed golftripsNOW as a 100% online golf travel solution to automate the planning and booking process. Booking golf vacations has never been so easy, and NOW we are here to change the way you book your golf trip forever!

<p>January and February of 2008, Dave Klingler had to under go a series of emergency operations on both of his feet because of bone infections.  The operations on Dave's right foot resulted in permanent disability in walking and standing.  Over the past four and a half years, Dave has incurred many medical bills which have drained his savings and added debts for his family. Finally, September of 2011, Dave found a doctor in Boise, Idaho (which is 310 miles and a 5 hour drive from his home) who feels that he can repair Dave's right foot to allow him to walk and stand, but Dave's part of the cost, not covered by his medical insurance, will be $12,000.  This breaks down to $6,000 deductible and $6,000 out of pocket before insurance pays 100%.  Without the surgery, the eventual choices are: absolutely no walking or standing (wheelchair) or amputation.</p>
<p> Dave has been the Meals on Wheels delivery driver and volunteer coordinator for the Rexburg, Idaho area since January 2006.  During the 6 months of 2008 when Dave was in the hospital and rehabilitation, his family and friends delivered the Meals on Wheels for him.  Even after 6 months, when he was able to have limited walking to return to work, he still had to have a permanent IV line because of an antibiotic resistant infection that he caught in the hospital that took 9 months to over come.  Dave has always done his best to be a good neighbor and to be of service to his community and the world in general (He spent 2 years in Portugal as a service missionary). </p>
<p> The funds raised will cover Dave’s cost to repair his right foot from a 95% disability to about a 25% disability.  This will allow Dave to walk and stand and do many activities that he now cannot enjoy.  Any additional funds collected will allow Dave to pay the travel expenses to Boise for the operation and the doctor follow-up visits ($132 in gas expense and $60 for motel each trip) and also to pay debts that he and his family have incurred from his disability (about $30K). Also, Dave's left foot is having some difficulty that needs correction in the future (Another $12K ?). </p>
<p> Please note the unique perks that Dave offers for your kind contributions. Dave's wife, Jackie (of 25 years), and his son and daughter wish to thank you for your consideration.   Also, it would be greatly appreciated if you can spread the word in the efforts for him to return to a more normal walking and standing life!  See the Indiegogo share tools to help! Dave’s children say—if nothing else his foot pictures are cool and gross!</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">The world continues to be affected significantly by multiple sclerosis. In Canada alone, 100,000 people live with this disease, and 3 more families learn every day that someone they love now has to cope with MS. In fact, just in my country, 1 in every 2 people knows someone directly affected.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">While it is most often diagnosed in young adults, aged 15 to 40, we know that it affects children, some as young as two years old, and women are more than three times as likely to be affected. That impact is felt by family, friends and by the community. MS is unpredictable, affecting vision, hearing, memory, balance and mobility. Its effects are physical, emotional, financial, and last a lifetime. There is no cure...</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">But MS isn't just Canada's disease. Yes, it's true: we are one of the most affected countries in the world, but you can find the spectre of MS haunting nearly every corner of the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">And as much as I wish it were otherwise, one of those next people to be diagnosed... might be you!</span></p></h3>
<h3>
<i style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">""Why not... try to make the best of things?""</i><br/>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">W</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">hen I was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis over 20 years ago, I felt lost. I always found myself asking ""why did this happen to me?""... but no matter how hard I looked, I wasn't finding any answers that made any sense to me. I eventually came to understand that if you can move beyond the ""whys"" and instead concentrate on the ""hows"", only then will you find yourself being rewarded for your efforts.</span><br/></p>
<p>You see, I eventually realized that ""karma"" occasionally works in reverse; that you will sometimes first find yourself having to sail your way through some pretty challenging waters, <i>before</i> reaching that paradise awaiting you on the other side of your journey.</p>
<p>Learning that type of perseverance has earned me many wonderful blessings, and as seemingly easy as it would have been for me to simply ""give up"", my doing so would have caused me to miss out on those great rewards.</p>
<p>I think that this point in my life is one such ""reward""!</p>
<h3><b><i>""Why not... try to lead by example?""</i></b></h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I've met some remarkable people over the years, whose strength and determination have served daily to inspire me! These ""heroes"" thrive in the face of adversity, and they have made it their mission to help others affected by multiple sclerosis to lead amazing lives of their own... and to one day be free from MS!</span></span><br/></p></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I am proud to say that I am now following their example as an ambassador and spokesperson, myself, for the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada. This way, I can give back to others the way this incredible organization has given of itself to me. I've gained a lot, too: I've learned the </span><strong style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>true</i></strong><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> definitions of both courage and fortitude, and what it </span><em style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">really</em><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> means to be a victor over your life, and not merely a victim of it!</span><br/></p>
<p>Now I want to stay in this good place, but to do that, I have to keep earning my right to be here! So... I'm giving back! I'm paying it forward, and in the only way I know how: uniquely mine! Thanks to a truly amazing life, and an incredible once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I now find myself with this unique chance: to honour all those people who came before; who have lead via their incredible examples... by setting an example of my own!<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span></p>
<h3><b><i>""Why not... try and tame Everest?""</i></b></h3>
<p>The expression ""go big or go home"" is one that resonates deeply within me!<br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A few years back I found myself being presented with this unique possibility: try tackling one of the toughest physical challenges anyone on planet Earth can face, regardless of any limitations they may possess.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> had never before dreamt of a chance like this coming into my life, but, like the good fortune that had been guiding me to that point, I trusted immediately what the opportunity represented: the means to</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> ""lead by example"", by helping to tear down the walls standing between the physically challenged and our wildest dreams. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So... here I am!</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Basically, using a specially designed wheelchair created specifically for the purpose of navigating rugged mountain terrain, I will be travelling with my team from Lhasa in Tibet, Asia, to Everest Base Camp... an over 12,000 ft. climb! </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I will be leaving in the fall of 2014 and the entire trip will last a little over 3 weeks. I have even been working to secure a cameraman to accompany up to that wilderness in the sky, to be filming this voyage for posterity, and hopefully sharing with the world my own example of what it means to face adversity... and win!</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Still, as brave and as worthy as all this may sound, the fact is... I simply can't do it alone. I need your help! More than that, I really want to bring a part of each and every one of you up that mountain with me!</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Here's how that can happen...</span></p>
<h3><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><i>""Why not... make a contribution yourself?""</i></b></span></h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Okay, Here's the deal folks:</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><strong>I'm using this whole experience as an opportunity to try and raise a whopping $100,000 to help end MS!</strong></p></span><p></p>

George Bernard Shaw 

""Why not... make an impact?""


The world continues to be affected significantly by multiple sclerosis. In Canada alone, 100,000 people live with this disease, and 3 more families learn every day that someone they love now has to cope with MS. In fact, just in my country, 1 in every 2 people knows someone directly affected.
While it is most often diagnosed in young adults, aged 15 to 40, we know that it affects children, some as young as two years old, and women are more than three times as likely to be affected. That impact is felt by family, friends and by the community. MS is unpredictable, affecting vision, hearing, memory, balance and mobility. Its effects are physical, emotional, financial, and last a lifetime. There is no cure...
But MS isn't just Canada's disease. Yes, it's true: we are one of the most affected countries in the world, but you can find the spectre of MS haunting nearly every corner of the globe.
And as much as I wish it were otherwise, one of those next people to be diagnosed... might be you!

""Why not... try to make the best of things?""

When I was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis over 20 years ago, I felt lost. I always found myself asking ""why did this happen to me?""... but no matter how hard I looked, I wasn't finding any answers that made any sense to me. I eventually came to understand that if you can move beyond the ""whys"" and instead concentrate on the ""hows"", only then will you find yourself being rewarded for your efforts.
You see, I eventually realized that ""karma"" occasionally works in reverse; that you will sometimes first find yourself having to sail your way through some pretty challenging waters, before reaching that paradise awaiting you on the other side of your journey.
Learning that type of perseverance has earned me many wonderful blessings, and as seemingly easy as it would have been for me to simply ""give up"", my doing so would have caused me to miss out on those great rewards.
I think that this point in my life is one such ""reward""!
""Why not... try to lead by example?""
I've met some remarkable people over the years, whose strength and determination have served daily to inspire me! These ""heroes"" thrive in the face of adversity, and they have made it their mission to help others affected by multiple sclerosis to lead amazing lives of their own... and to one day be free from MS!
I am proud to say that I am now following their example as an ambassador and spokesperson, myself, for the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada. This way, I can give back to others the way this incredible organization has given of itself to me. I've gained a lot, too: I've learned the true definitions of both courage and fortitude, and what it really means to be a victor over your life, and not merely a victim of it!
Now I want to stay in this good place, but to do that, I have to keep earning my right to be here! So... I'm giving back! I'm paying it forward, and in the only way I know how: uniquely mine! Thanks to a truly amazing life, and an incredible once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, I now find myself with this unique chance: to honour all those people who came before; who have lead via their incredible examples... by setting an example of my own! 
""Why not... try and tame Everest?""
The expression ""go big or go home"" is one that resonates deeply within me!
A few years back I found myself being presented with this unique possibility: try tackling one of the toughest physical challenges anyone on planet Earth can face, regardless of any limitations they may possess.
I had never before dreamt of a chance like this coming into my life, but, like the good fortune that had been guiding me to that point, I trusted immediately what the opportunity represented: the means to ""lead by example"", by helping to tear down the walls standing between the physically challenged and our wildest dreams. So... here I am!
Basically, using a specially designed wheelchair created specifically for the purpose of navigating rugged mountain terrain, I will be travelling with my team from Lhasa in Tibet, Asia, to Everest Base Camp... an over 12,000 ft. climb! 
I will be leaving in the fall of 2014 and the entire trip will last a little over 3 weeks. I have even been working to secure a cameraman to accompany up to that wilderness in the sky, to be filming this voyage for posterity, and hopefully sharing with the world my own example of what it means to face adversity... and win!
Still, as brave and as worthy as all this may sound, the fact is... I simply can't do it alone. I need your help! More than that, I really want to bring a part of each and every one of you up that mountain with me!
Here's how that can happen...
""Why not... make a contribution yourself?""
Okay, Here's the deal folks:

I'm using this whole experience as an opportunity to try and raise a whopping $100,000 to help end MS!
By donating to this cause, you're not only helping to find a cause and cure for multiple sclerosis, but you're also helping me and my team to secure part of the funding needed to pay for our equipment, including that special wheelchair I mentioned, plus part of our travel expenses.
But here's the best reason of all to give: of that huge goal I envision, over 75% of that money is being allocated to the MS Society of Canada, helping it to succeed in its mission: to be a leader in finding a cure for multiple sclerosis, and enabling people affected by MS to enhance their quality of life!
That's on TOP of the nearly $20,000 I've already successfully raised to date--pure fundraising dollars that go directly towards assisting those coping with multiple sclerosis to live better lives! 
And since I'm also a really big fan of the win/win philosophy, I'm making this worth your while, too! So... here's some of what YOU will be getting for your invaluable contribution:


MultipleMike Climbs branded clothing, including shirts, hats and even shoe laces

MS Bands of Hope for you to proudly wear and show off

Printed greeting cards of paintings by the late Kathy Harvey, an award-winning and inspirational quadriplegic mouth painter who lived with MS.



""Why not!""

<em><strong>Our daughter Margaret, age 14  has a rare autoimmune disorder called Pediatric Autoimmune neurological disorder Associated with Strep. When she is exposed to a viral or bacteria illness her antibodies cross her blood brain barrier and attack her brain causing inflamation and a miriad of symptoms. She developed this illness at age 6 from a strep infection and was misdiagnosed for several years because it is such a rare and newly recognized illness.  Some of the symptoms that are the result of the inflamation are OCD, nerological tics, anxiety, and reading and writing difficulties. Since finally getting a diagnosis three years ago, symptoms have been somewhat manageable on antibiotics and steroids, however these treatments are just bandaids for her symptoms. What she desperatly needs are more aggressive treatments to halt the autoimmune preocess such</strong></em><em><strong>  as</strong></em><em><strong>IVIG and plasma exchange which are</strong></em><em><strong>extremely costly and cosnsidered experimental because they are in the trial stages at Yale Childrens Research Institute. These treatments cost approximately </strong></em><em><strong>$10,000 per treatment and she may need several. </strong></em>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>When we adopted our first son Charlie, we expected him to die.  He has a severe form of Recessive <br/>Dystrophic
 Epidermolysis Bullosa.  This disease occurs because of a missing 
protein that binds the two layers of skin together.  The slightest 
bump or rub will cause skin to blister and fall off revealing wounds 
similar to 2nd and 3rd degree burns.  Even the inside of the body 
is affected.  Children endure extreme pain daily.  Dressing 
changes and baths take up to 5 hours.  Eyeballs can blister causing
 painful corneal erosions and days spent in the dark.  Hands and 
feet fuse making mitten deformities.  Blisters in the throat cause 
strictures making it almost impossible to eat and possibly cutting off 
the airway.  If a person does not succumb to infection...a severe 
form of Squamous Cell Carcinoma will develop and take the life.  
When I heard of a clinical trial in Minnesota using stem cells to treat 
Epidermolysis Bullosa we met with doctors.  A perfect donor match 
was found and Charlie was accepted.  Then Wisconsin Medicaid denied
 this life saving treatment.  I contacted State Representatives, 
Congress, Media, and the community and we rallied for Charlie's 
cause.  Medicaid rescinded it decision and now because of Charlie, 
Medicaid is changing how they authorize life saving treatments for rare 
diseases.  One year ago today, Charlie had a Stem Cell 
Transplant.  He is one of the first children in the world with this
 disease that have ever seen such incredible results.  No longer 
does skin fall off, we use 1/100th of the dressings that we used before,
 and he can enjoy life with out pain like a regular 5 year old boy 
should.</p>

<p>Now, we have been given the 
opportunity to once again save the life of a child.  We are 
adopting a little boy with severe EB who has never had a family.   He currently lives in a group home and 
has never had a ""constant"" person that he could depend on.  We do 
not believe that this is an acceptable way to live.  I am going to 
meet him in 3 weeks and I am flying him back to our home at the end of 
March.  This is the problem.  Seth does not have a bedroom or a
 medical/dressing room for baths and dressing changes.  We need to 
make our house wheelchair accessible to have him live with us and become
 our son. <br/></p>

It's time to take action.  Healing Warriors Program is a Registered Vendor with the Denver and Cheyenne VA Medical Centers.  We launched our first clinic offering  non-invasive therapies for pain, PTSD, anxiety and other ailments in July 2013.  The goal of the Healing Warriors Program is to provide integrated therapy options and self-care training to manage and alleviate pain, PTSD, and other symptoms from the injuries experienced by service men and women and their families.

Why Healing Warriors Program?In just a few short months,  we have delivered over 75 sessions.  The Healing Warriors Program clinic is a success! 


Since opening our doors in July, we have experienced exponential month-over-month growth. Demands for our services are increasing rapidly and our recent filing for registered vendor status with the VA is further growing our referral network. We are making a difference providing relief for service members and their families.  This is why we are here.  

Simply put, we need Clinic Space!  
Healing Warriors Program (HWP) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. The HWP clinics are necessary and effective. Our therapy options are helping  service members and their families with relief of pain, anxiety, stress, and sleep disorders,  and is improving their overall day-to-day quality of life.  We are thrilled at our faster than anticipated growth, but realize that we are outgrowing our space faster than we had expected. This will soon result in treatment delays that are so vital to the continued good health of this community.  Your contribution directly funds the Healing Warriors Program clinics,  ensuring that we can deliver timely treatments to the service men and women, and their families, who so desperately need these services.

 Where Does the Money Go?




We provide five sessions at no charge to the Service member and their family, with additional sessions offered at the subsidized rate of $30. Your donation goes directly to pay for clinic space.  We are asking for your support in giving us a safe, clean and warm place where we can provide these much needed clinic services.Join us in making a difference in the lives of service members and their families so that together we can achieve wellness and healing.  Help us support a shift towards a healthier, more holistic model for wellness. Remember, what we do here today with our returning veterans will impact generations to come. Let's join together to help with pain, anxiety, stress and trauma and the well-being of our military families. Let's join together as a community. We can do it.





Other Ways You Can Help

Please spread the word about the work we are doing.  Many of us know a service member or a service family.  Let them know we are here.  Let them know they can come in for services.  
We are often asked if someone can come to the clinic from out of town to obtain services.  The answer is YES.  We are here to serve and support our service member community.  
We have a growing veteran population with severe pain, traumatic brain injuries and PTSD issues.   Together we make a difference.  Together we create a new and brighter tomorrow..",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Thirsty To Live Longer</h2>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Thirsty to live longer is a campaign that we started in the beginning of 2015. Our platform is to help people get involved in a healthy lifestyle and to raise awareness of  the dangers of excessive consumption of sweetners in the American diet. Nutrition is the foundation of leading a healthy life, and moderation is the building blocks.  Too much high fructose corn syrup, and refined sugars are the leading cause of metabolic disorders such as chronic exhaustion, obesity, diabetes type II and many other disorders.  Along with the excessive consumption of sweeteners we also have to include lack of physical activity.  It is not just adults who are lacking physical activity but an even greater problem exists with the children of this generation.  This problem is not only in America, but worldwide. </span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""> More and more individuals have become sedentary and less active which is the leading cause of new health issues.  These new health issues are often called hypokinetic disorders which literally means disorders resulting from lack of motion. The decrease in physical activity in our society has contributed substantially to the current high mortality rates from these disorders, so its obvious that we need to become more active but its hard for us when we are so busy with so many other things to do. Ontop of that most people are usually exhausted by the afternoon hour.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>So what does our society do about our lack of human energy?  Well the manufactering industry figured out the human body needs energy. So energy drinks, sports drinks, and sugary drinks were developed as the solution.  Which is great! However, most of these drinks are providing energy but they are also causing negative side effects.  These negative side effects are working long term against the human body. When you consume these drinks your body has energy for a while your heart is pumping in overdrive and then BAAAM! Extreme exhaustion-(the crash effect) sets in.  Why?  The number 1 reason is your body has become dehydrated.  Your body is lacking essential powerhouse nutrients to keep it going.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""> <b><i>founder and creator-(Rodney Dale Crowley)</i></b></span></div>
<div> After realizing the vicious cycle the human body was going through from the injestion of these drinks, I was determined to create a natural energy drink that had positive side effects, no crash effect, and a great taste.  Realizing todays nutritional information only provided half of the answers,  l decided to start researching the diet of our ancestors 7000 years ago.  After 4 years of indepth research of cross referencing current science books-(Human Anatomy, Human Physiology, Nutrition, Chemistry, Microbiology) with ancient modern historical books-(the Bible, Ice Age, Prehistoric World, Stone Age Civilizations etc.) and over 200 human test subjects myself included, Redox Plant Based Energy was finally formulated.  A perfect balance of essential natural nutrients: electrolytes, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and so much more.</div>

However, you lose out on cool benefits from the smart remote, app, and emergency alert functionality.</p><p><strong>Q:  Is the OMNI waterproof?</strong><br/>A:  No. OMNI and the smart remote are designed to be dust, sweat and water-resistant to handle the wear of everyday use of rigorous cycling and inclement weather. OMNI is resistant to rain, snow, sweat, and light moisture, however, OMNI cannot be submerged in water. OMNI should be stored in a cool dry space when not in use.</p><p><strong>Q:  How does the battery work?</strong><br/>A:  The internal helmet battery is charged through standard micro-USB charging cable (provided), and has 8+ hours of play/talk time.</p><p><strong>Q:  Do I need to carry my phone?</strong><br/>A:  To get the full benefit of Coros OMNI Smart Helmet, you need to have your Bluetooth-enabled device with you so it's in Bluetooth proximity. However, if you want to ride disconnected for a bit, just put the helmet on and ride with the same safety benefits of a non-tech enabled helmet.</p><p><strong>Q:  What happens if I have a cycling accident and my </strong><strong>Coros</strong><strong> helmet is damaged?</strong><br/>A:  If you are unfortunate enough to be involved in an accident and the impact damages your helmet we will provide you with a new helmet at a discount.

Sound waves are converted into vibrations and delivered through your upper cheekbones. The cochlea receives the vibrations, bypassing the ear canal and eardrum. For cyclists, this is super important because that means you can hear audio and hear your surroundings as you ride, such as cars and other potentially dangerous obstacles.OMNI includes a built-in day/night LED safety illumination feature designed to provide maximum visibility, day and night. The LED illumination feature automatically activates at dusk via a built-in light sensor.  The light can also be activated via the handlebar mounted smart remote during day or night.Included with the Coros™ OMNI system is the handlebar mounted Coros™ Smart Remote. Control volume, skip tracks, pause music, take calls, activate built-in safety light, record ride data and more without stopping to fumble with your phone. Easy to install on any handlebar, it gives riders an easy, safe way to stay connected while they ride.Available for Apple iOS or Android.

Zero Gravity Upright Posture (ZGUP) Cushion is undoubtedly the most ergonomic and comfortable cushion you will find. it produces a weightless sitting experience so you can get up feeling revitalized.  Releases sitting stress & slumping stress on your spine and hips, and promotes a healthier lifestyle, and Reduce neck, shoulder, and back pain to power through your day.

 

 
Improving posture could be a vague idea. You may think a series of personal training sessions, strict diets, and miles of walking and running will do the trick. 

However, it is actually easier than that. Muscles are very dynamic. Re-training the muscles can changes your bone structure. Here is a catch though. Building muscles memory takes about 3 months. Plus, you need to introduce new good habits to your muscles. It's like learning how to play golf for the first time. 
Using the Zero-Gravity Upright Posture Cushion helps build muscle memory. Your body will realize poor posture and bad habits, and start working towards good posture. Using it for months will make your body feel a ton much better. Consistency. That's why we build this cushion because it can fit into your lifestyle seamlessly and change your habits immediately.
 

 

 

 

 
Slumping Stress indicates:
1. Inflexibility of the Joints indicates Stiffness in Hips, Knees, Back & Neck (Spines)
2. Low Back Pain & Neck Pain that may develop into chronic pain
 
3. Compressed Spines & Discs that may develop into Sciatica (pain radiating down the legs), Numbness or pins-and-needles in an arm or leg, etc.
 
 

Sitting on Zero-Gravity Upright Posture Cushion feels like skilled therapists' hands, correcting your sitting posture. Check it out.

 
See the Difference!
 
Sitting is not natural to the body. We can help you with ZGUP Cushion.
 

 
Great Posture at the chairs not only helps your back and neck, but your sit bones & intervertebral discs (Discs between each spine). By evenly distributing weight and pressure of the body, your sitting is much more effortless; Your Spines & Hips will appreciate you at night.
 

 
Zero Gravity Upright Posture Cushion ships with the mesh cover: anti-sweat cover (double layer mesh) that is breathable with great ventilation.
Memory foam is Visco foam that features:

Better contouring and pressure relief 

Better durability and a longer comfort life 
Better motion dampening 
More resistant to microorganisms and allergens
Highly resistant to bacteria, mold, mildew, mites, and other odor causing germs
Plus, the Visco Foam has semi-permanent durability. It won't deform unless you burn it.

 

 

 
 

 
And... We Mean It.

I know, I've been there. We are either ruminating about the past, or worrying about the future. Research suggests this is one of our greatest barriers to Happiness.The good news? Getting engaged in the present moment is easy using our senses. Simply engaging the sense of smell, sight, sound, touch or taste and brings the mind back into the  present moment. The Products Our Happiness Mood-scent blend is an uplifting blend of lemon, bergamot, mandarin, grapefruit, and lime essential oils. We then infuse the blend into a number of products, including bath bombs (Mood-bombs), body butters (Mood-butters), scent sticks (Mood-sticks), body scrubs (Mood-scrubs), massage oils (Mood-oils), shower aromatherapy steamers (Mood-steamers), and room / body sprays (Mood-sprays). The Happiness Mood-stick is the ultimate life hack - use them before big presentations, on an airplane, on the way to spinning, when you're road tripping, before bed to wind down, or for meditation (they are essential oils, not the strong perfumey kinds of scents, and the mood sticks keep the scent where they belong - on you!). They fit easily inside a backpack, pursue, or briefcase. Mood-sticks are a  quick pick-me up and reminder on the importance of the moment.I personally, created this company based desire to get present. I wanted to make it easy for people to know what scents correlated to what moods, using essential oil blends (I'm not a fan of straight essential oils, so I wanted to see what kind of magic we could create with a blend), so I got an incredible team of experts, combined with my own knowledge and research, and created a line of scents to support your healthy habit of being here, now. And guess what? People love the new blend!   21-Days to HappinessTo make the experience of Happiness even greater, we are thrilled to be working on a 21-Day course with Dr. Lombardo that is just about ready to launch. As it isn't just about engaging the senses to get present, it is about then doing positive actions each and every day to continue a mindset of Happiness. The course gives quick videos with a daily practice to focus on each that takes you on a journey to greater engagement, joy, and well-being by teaching concepts like the hot tub syndrome, dropping perfectionism, staying in the yellow zone, and more!  The Mood Factory BackgroundThe initial Mood Factory product line did so well, selling over 9 million products and raising over a million dollars for charities relating to breast cancer, autism, heart disease, and mental health. We are excited to take the company to the next level, and impact lives globally in a positive way. We don't want to launch just another 'consumer product', we want to launch a product with positive intention to change lives for the better.Founder StoryI've worked personally to create global change for mental health, even when I had very little money to do so, because of a need I saw in 2004 to end the stigma of depression through rebranding the disease. We did more than I ever could have imagined with iFred, and in 2015 created a curriculum that teaches HOPE to kids based on research it is a skill you can create and cultivate. I've shared my story at the United Nations, advocated to get mental health in the Sustainable Development Goals via the advisory board of FundaMentalSDG, serve on the advisory board of the Global Mental Health Movement, write for PsychCentral, and am on the steering committee of YMentalHealth, a global coalition of organizations committed to youth mental health. And with your support, we have only just begun!   Coloring Lives* So as this is part of my passion and our business model, we are giving 10% of the money raised on this IndieGogo Campaign to our Hopeful Minds program (not including shipping), to help teach this critical skill around the world. Recent research out of Northern Ireland on our program showed it reduced anxiety, improved emotional regulation, and increased hope levels among the participating 8-10 year old children so we are eager to expand it. We consider the knowledge of how to create, maintain, and sustain 'Hope' a human right, and want it free and accessible to all around the globe. Thank you!!!Your support of this campaign means the world to me. As your support enables the initial production run with our incredible partners at Smith & Vandiver. That run gets products in to the hands of retailer buyers, press, and key influencers around the world.  Smith & Vandiver has the capability, knowledge, and know-how to distribute this line to major retailers globally, but I've got to get the line started, in the hands of people like you using them and giving us feedback (hopefully positive!), so buyers can see the demand.Thank you, so much, for considering supporting this campaign. I'm so excited to get these scents to the world, help raise money for charities, and support a positive mood state for us all. As if you are like me, you don't want to just be present, you want to feel AMAZING in the here and now.A Few of our Experts:Want to learn more about scents and moods?

<h3><strong>Who are We and What We're Doing</strong></h3>
<p><br/>I have had a dream for several years to open a private Holistic School for children. <br/><br/>We are going to start with one location and expand out as a franchise, so this new school concept can be Nationwide. <br/><br/>Starseed Holistic School is a Mind, Body, Spiritual approach to education. We offer a top-notch Whole Brain Learning education and have a holistic team on hand to assist each student’s challenges whether they be physical, mental, or emotional.</p>
<p>We are a one-stop school for education and healing the body from a holistic approach. Students can get the whole mind, body, spirit approach without the forcefulness of religious aspects. Our school respects everyone’s spirituals values and beliefs.</p>
<p>Our organic cafeteria will be equipped to handle all special dietary needs. Our holistic testing and healing center will offer ways of healing and support through special diets, supplements, various holistic education and healing modalities.</p>
<p>Starseed Holistic School specializes in Creative Arts. Our students learn through art, music and movement. We will hold monthly talent shows to help children break fears on stage by being supportive of each other.</p>
<p>Families that attend our school are happy, loving, and care about the health and spiritual well-being of their children. We help them grow and bond with other like minds and heal their bodies at the same time.</p>
<p>Our first location will be in Boulder County, CO. We are looking to perfect this first location and then become a franchise across the country. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need to Start</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Business incorporating fees in the United States of America will cost – <strong>$750.</strong>
</li>
<li>The budget for Liability insurance, permits and license will cost – <strong>$3,500</strong>
</li>
<li>Acquiring a large facility that will accommodate the number of block of closes, playing field, staff offices and parking lots et al (Re – Construction of the facility inclusive) will cost – <strong>$350,000.</strong>
</li>
<li>Equipping the classes and office (computers, printers, projectors, markers, pens and pencils, furniture, telephones, filing cabinets, and electronics) will cost – <strong>$50,000</strong>
</li>
<li>Launching a virtual school website will cost – <strong>$500</strong>
</li>
<li>The budget for the payment of salaries for the first three months of operations: <strong>$120,000</strong>
</li>
<li>Additional Expenditure such as Business cards, Signage, Adverts and Promotions will cost – <strong>$15,000</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Going by the market survey and feasibility studies conducted, we came to the conclusion that we will need an average of <strong>$750,000</strong> to start a small scale but standard private school in the United States of America.<br/><br/>If we don't reach our entire goal, then we will start as seed school at remote locations to pay teachers until we can have enough funding for a building. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

We have taken resistance bands, and all their benefits, and stitched them into comfortable, moisture-wicking athletic pants to create a product that will reshape your health, fitness, and performance. Leave the cords, clips, sleds, and straps behind. With 8 resistance bands stitched inside, AGOGIE adds constant tension to every movement, quickly warming your muscles and challenging you in new ways no matter where you are. No setup required.Think about it as adding gravity to every motion rather than adding weight.  With the pants on, you are constantly working to keep the resistance bands stretched out.After 5-10 minutes, your leg muscles will begin to warm and your core body temperature will rise.With this constant resistance, your muscles have to work harder to do the same tasks. Your tendons and ligaments have to work at all times to stabilize this extra workload.  THE CONSTANT RESISTANCE FINDS YOUR WEAK AREAS AND FORCES THEM TO BECOME STRONGER.Once you have the pants on, the resistance feels like it goes away. Don’t be fooled. It hasn’t gone anywhere! Once you take them off, you will feel lighter on your feet and have a spring in your step.   Comfortable enough for all-day wear, the breathable, moisture-wicking fabric allows the resistance bands to stretch out and comfortably move with your body, while the resistance bands are positioned to mimic natural muscle and ligament lines.Join the community, and let’s revolutionize fitness together.Our mission is to make it simple for individuals to live healthy, active lives, where life happens. We believe people should spend more time doing what they love, with who they love, without compromising their health, quality of life or joy of life.The AGOGIE community is connected by something more than a product.

Help lower back posture and relieve back pain, tailbone, and other back issues
With waterproof and moisture-proof design, ideal for outdoor activities
Foldable design, very convenient to store. Light weight and easy to carry 
 COLOR OPTION- DARK GREY Living a sedentary lifestyle and sitting for long periods can be more damaging to your health that you can ever imagine. Back pains, sciatica, neck problems and even heart disease can all be direct results from sitting uncomfortably.  Many materials including latex used to e thought of as the ""best"" choice for seat cushions. However, these materials do not allow for flow throughout the chair and are breeding grounds for bacteria, dust mites, bed bugs and more. Plus, they can lose their composure, meaning that their padding and functionality diminish over time.While Memory Foam cushions took the world by storm over the past 20 years, they can quickly break down after intensive use. This means large chunks of foam falling off, leaving a path of debri while compromising their ability to help your body.Why E.V.A. over Memory Foam?EVA Cushion is made of soft and solid foam of a very good quality, with no smell: EVA-foam (ethylene vinyl acetate). EVA feels like velvet and resembles the feeling of human skin, therefore it gives a safe feeling to children. Moreover, EVA is partly made from natural rubber, one of the least harmful synthetic materials. With optimal combustion, only CO2 and H2O are released, so  So we can say that EVA is a rather environmentally friendly plastic. EVA's design lifts the coccyx to align your posture, while offering the support that your buttox and thighs need while sitting. This keeps your back straight, shoulders up and ensures that your entire body achieves its natural S-Curve, which is vital to a comfortable seating position. By promoting proper posture, EVA begins building your core muscles. This offers the stability that your entire body needs to maintain a strong and healthy posture, as the muscles provide the balance that your spine needs to be free from pain and discomfort.
Durable, Long-lasting 
Easy-to-clean

<p><strong>Black rice bran has been known as a rich source of skin improvement substances.</strong> However, cause of the rigid structure of the rice bran itself, it is hard to extract the skin improvement substances in perfect condition.</p>
<p>QB Skin Lab Team has researched for years to extract those antioxidant, wrinkle improvement, brightening substance of the black rice bran. And finally developed an extract method based on fermentation process, <strong>which enabled to deliver the outstanding skin improvement effects of the black rice bran to consumers. </strong></p> <p><strong>LuBi Ampoule is an advanced serum which uses fermented black rice bran extracts, which provides you a wide range of skin improvement effects.</strong></p> <p>The table below, shows superior anti aging, whitening and wrinkle improvement effect of black rice compared to ordinary rice(white rice).</p>

<p>LuBi is an ampoule that harnesses the nutrients in black rice bran to create powerful anti-aging effects for the skin! This is all made possible due to our in-house research and development of the <strong>Solid-State Ion Fermentation Technique </strong>that our team created.</p>
<p>With this technique, <strong>we were able to extract skin improvement substances of the black rice bran in the best condition. </strong>In addition, <strong>we were able to reduce the particle size to make it smaller than the average skin pore.</strong> This means that the anti-aging nutrients and other skin improvement substances contained within black rice bran will be able to penetrate into the deepest layers of your skin!</p>

<p>Even though black rice bran has many outstanding benefits for our skin, it is difficult to extract all the nutrients from each grain because of its solid structure. However, our in-house developed solid-state ion fermentation Technology uses acidic ionized water to extract all the key nutrients from the hard outer layers of each grain. This process makes LuBi ampoule available to provide customers wide range of skin effects such as antioxidation, wrinkle improvement, brightening and moisturizing.</p>

<p>Your skin tone becomes uneven and darker as it ages due to the melanin production(pigmentation). This process is similar to the discoloration that occurs with apples that are exposed to oxygen for a prolonged period. As you can see on the image, once LuBi ampoule is applied on the apple slice, the area that was originally discolored is restored to its original form.

<div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>
</div></div></div>","Black rice bran has been known as a rich source of skin improvement substances. However, cause of the rigid structure of the rice bran itself, it is hard to extract the skin improvement substances in perfect condition.
QB Skin Lab Team has researched for years to extract those antioxidant, wrinkle improvement, brightening substance of the black rice bran. And finally developed an extract method based on fermentation process, which enabled to deliver the outstanding skin improvement effects of the black rice bran to consumers.  LuBi Ampoule is an advanced serum which uses fermented black rice bran extracts, which provides you a wide range of skin improvement effects. The table below, shows superior anti aging, whitening and wrinkle improvement effect of black rice compared to ordinary rice(white rice).

 

LuBi is an ampoule that harnesses the nutrients in black rice bran to create powerful anti-aging effects for the skin! This is all made possible due to our in-house research and development of the Solid-State Ion Fermentation Technique that our team created.
With this technique, we were able to extract skin improvement substances of the black rice bran in the best condition. In addition, we were able to reduce the particle size to make it smaller than the average skin pore. This means that the anti-aging nutrients and other skin improvement substances contained within black rice bran will be able to penetrate into the deepest layers of your skin!





Even though black rice bran has many outstanding benefits for our skin, it is difficult to extract all the nutrients from each grain because of its solid structure. However, our in-house developed solid-state ion fermentation Technology uses acidic ionized water to extract all the key nutrients from the hard outer layers of each grain. This process makes LuBi ampoule available to provide customers wide range of skin effects such as antioxidation, wrinkle improvement, brightening and moisturizing.
 

Our in-house technology extracts only the best skincare components from black rice bran. LuBi ampoule’s antioxidant(anti-aging) and wrinkle improvement components that are rich in black rice help restore firm facial skin. In addition, black rice’s brightening and moisturizing features help improve uneven skin tone and help the skin stay moisturized for longer.   
The apple that turned brown in the apple test above represents aged skin. Made of black rice extracts that are rich in antioxidant(anti-aging) ingredients, LuBi ampoule was able to restore the brown apple back to its original fresh color. This anti-aging property in LuBi ampoule can help prevent skin aging and give your skin a more youthful glow. 
Your skin tone becomes uneven and darker as it ages due to the melanin production(pigmentation). This process is similar to the discoloration that occurs with apples that are exposed to oxygen for a prolonged period. As you can see on the image, once LuBi ampoule is applied on the apple slice, the area that was originally discolored is restored to its original form. The brightening effects will help improve your skin tone as well. 
Moisturizing components (ceramides) are rich in black rice which helps the skin maintain its moisture, and keeps your skin from becoming dry.

This process also makes LuBi ampoule's molecular size smaller than an average facial skin pore so that the nutrients can be delivered to the deepest skin layers.  
 LuBi ampoule goes all the way into the deeper skin layers with its small molecular size. Other skincare products’ molecules do not get absorbed completely and therefore, the remaining residue on the surface of the skin can cause blockage in your pores and result in skin troubles. 
When we dropped water and LuBi ampoule on each flower petal, the petal with LuBi ampoule was absorbed faster than the petal with water. Like the test above, LuBi ampoule absorbs rapidly into your skin and helps your skin maintain its moisture without any sticky residue leftover.


LuBi Also Works Great For Men!

Your help will go towards a prosthetic, medical bills, immediate expenses, and a cheap running vehicle. Our concerns are that his wounds are not healing right and he will risk having another infection if he cannot be mobile. Please help our Superman get back to life.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Signe Green, and I'd like to go home to California this February. I live in a small town in Michigan and every year I get very sick because I don't get enough sunlight. I am a college student currently enrolled full-time and I miss the sunshine, and I would like to go where it is warm this winter. I was born and raised in California, and I moved to Michigan five years ago, each year I get more and more sick, either by bronchitis or s.a.d. I don't have any extra money to spend on a trip because right now I have a job, but I'm using my income to pay for college.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If I don't make it home to California for a week, I might get very sick again. Last year in February I bruised my ribs by coughing because I had had bronchitis for three months. I wasn't sure I'd ever get well again, and the cold air in Michigan makes it very hard for me to breathe.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>I need to raise about 2000 dollars - enough to cover my plane expense there and back, and my lodgings for a week. Staying in California is expensive, and it is also very expensive to fly there, a usual flight costs about 1,200 dollars round trip. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please help me raise money so I can be healthy this year! Share this site with your friends, your family, and anyone else who might care. </p>

Crisano became the first female wrestler ever in Section 9 to win a Varsity match against a male wrestler other than by forfeit. Crisano went from wrestling novice to finishing second at the first Women’s National Wrestling tournament in Albuquerque, NM. She was also the 138lb New York State women’s champion and finished second at the Northeast Regionals in Syracuse, NY. She posted an impressive 20-2 record. Crisano continued wrestling outside of High School competing in recreational tournaments on the East Coast. In 2002 she was involved in a auto accident that almost ended her life. She defeated what was supposed to be the impossible and decided it was time to return to the mats. In 2009 she returned to the mats and is now preparing to make her Professional debut as a MMA Fighter in September 2012.  Crisano who once made her marks on the mat as an NY native girl is ready to make her mark in the cage for the world..........</p>

Make my dream of running again possible with your contribution. Once I get this new leg I plan to train regularly (especially looking forward to running with my daughter, Elke) and participate in area 5ks.  I only wanted to be limited by my commitment to running, not my equipment. And There's MoreAll contributions over the cost of this prosthesis will go to the Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF), who generously held a running clinic in Boston in October 2013 where famed trainer Bob Gailey taught me how to run with a prosthesis and I got to meet gold-medal Olympian (and my personal hero), Joan Benoit Samuelson.Run with Us!Elke and I plan to run the Boston Color Me Rad 5k on May 31st. We are running as Team Leg Up and would love you to join us. Prosthetic ParityRemember how I said insurance companies consider running legs (and any special activity legs) ""luxury items""? While my insurance company won't cover a running leg, I am still one of the lucky ones. I have insurance that pays for good walking legs. Not everyone is as lucky. Many amputees aren't properly insured for even basic walking legs. I am hoping to take this opportunity to discuss the challenges of prosthetic coverage (you'll be hearing more from me on this one!). More on this issue from Peggy Chenoweth (AKA the Amputee Mommy). Prosthetic Parity ExposedAnd the Amputee Coalition's Arms and Legs Are Not a Luxury campaign. Thanks to Phil Aiken for naming this campaign and Glenn Britland for designing the logo. More on the PerksMy in-house rainbow loomer, Elke. Me and my creative team.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

I wanted to make a product that was as natural as possible, promoted healthy skin and combined the therapeutic benefits of aromatherapy. A friend of mine who is an aromatherapist once told me the story of the four thieves and she made a blend based on it. I loved how it smelled and I loved how it made me feel when I smelled it. We lost touch many years ago but I couldn't get that blend out of my head. I couldn't find it anywhere, so I started playing with my own blend loosely based on the four thieves. I will never forget the moment I added the last drop to the blend, took a good whiff and knew that was it! That was my blend! Now I just needed something to call it. As a yoga teacher, I wanted to give it a ""yoga"" theme and since it was loosely based on the four thieves’ blend I wanted to use another word for thief. With that, The Yoga Bandit essential oil blend was born.<br/><br/>To start, let me tell you the story of the four thieves. As the bubonic plague ravaged Europe in the year 1413, the story of the four thieves arrived on the scene and the story has changed history. They were captured and charged with robbing the dead and dying victims but it was noticed that they remained free of the plague. When the thieves were tried, the magistrate offered leniency if they would reveal how they resisted contracting the infection as they performed their gruesome acts. The four thieves explained that they were perfumers and spice traders and finally exposed their special concoction of aromatic herbs, including cloves and rosemary that they rubbed on their hands, ears, and temples. This prevented them from contracting the disease! They hoped to receive a lighter sentence by cooperating with the magistrate, not sure if they did though.<br/><br/>The first product I made was the lip balm. I thought it would be a great way to save money and perhaps have a nice, unique gift to give my family and friends. I started experimenting with different formulas until I got exactly what I wanted. I made a few tubes mixing in my essential oil blend and started handing them out to my family and friends to try. To my pleasant surprise, it was a hit! Before I knew it, the requests came pouring in to have a sample to give to their family and friends. It was quickly compared to other nationally recognized premium lip balms on the market. <br/><br/>After receiving such a great response about the lip balm, I quickly realized that I was on to something and decided it would be great to create a natural ointment that would moisturize and heal the skin. I started researching the healing properties of various natural oils and ingredients and quickly got to work cooking up several prototypes that would soon be The Yoga Bandit 'OM'ollient (my play on the word emollient). I packaged it up and sent it on its way to everyone I could. Again, the response was overwhelming! I started receiving daily messages telling me how much people loved it. Not only that, I began receiving feedback on all the things people were using the ointment for: from skin irritations to burns, scrapes, eczema, insect bites to even a natural insect repellent. As I shared Yoga Bandit with others and talked about my product, I started getting suggestions for other products I should offer. It became very clear to me that my hobby was turning into an opportunity! I didn't want to get carried away and offer everything under the sun. After all, I have a full time job and teach yoga in the evenings. I needed to keep it limited to something I could realistically manage in my spare time. I wanted to provide quality products that people used every day and that made them feel good. I began thinking of the things I wanted to buy myself but could never seem to find. From that moment forward, I spent all my spare time researching, experimenting and creating new product to add to the collection. Yoga Bandit was born from lip balm and has now evolved to include, ointment, body lotion, soaps and sprays.<br/><br/>I realize there are many other skin care products on the market. However, I have dedicated a lot of time researching the ingredients to make my Yoga Bandit products. I've selected the essential oils for their benefits as described by the NAHA (National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy) and AromaWeb. For example, these sources say Cinnamon oil is good for exhaustion, rheumatism, scabies, and stress; and that Clove Bud (Eugenia caryops) can help ease arthritis, asthma, bronchitis, rheumatism, sprains and strains. They say that Eucalyptus is helpful in treating respiratory problems, helps to boost the immune system, and can relieve muscle tension. Lavender is known to aid relaxation and is also useful in treating wounds and burns. Lemon is very uplifting, yet relaxing. It can be helpful in treating wounds and in deodorizing. Peppermint and Rosemary are useful in easing muscle aches and tension. Tea Tree Oil is natural anti-fungal oil. I also took great care in selecting the right carrier oils. I included ones that are best for the skin based on their moisturizing effects and Vitamin E oil content that wouldn't clog the pores. Yoga Bandit combines ingredients that have the properties to promote healthy skin with aromatherapy to promote a healthy mind as well.</p>
<p>Yoga Bandit is now selling at farmers markets, community market days and at local wellness centers which is all wonderful. It's now time to invest more time and money in manufacturing Yoga Bandit to be enjoyed by everyone inside and out of our local community. We have our marketing strategy in place, currently pitching to major retailers and are ready to invest in the proper manufacturing tools to produce our product on a larger scale. That's where you come in; with your help, soon, Yoga Bandit will be able to be found and enjoyed everywhere.</p>
<p>Your funding will assist us in securing custom labels, bulk product and supplies, manufacturing equipment and insurance. As we grow, proceeds will be reinvested for product expansion, advertising, public relations and mass production. Our ultimate goal far exceeds the desire to sell Yoga Bandit in stores worldwide, we would like to pay it forward by establishing a business opportunity for others to promote health and well being while having the freedom to pursue the work life balance we all so very much deserve.</p>

<h3>My Plea for a Handicapped Van</h3>
<p>I was afflicted with multiple sclerosis as a college student and have been bound in a wheelchair for 12 years now.  For transportation from my apartment, I rely on a local transit company that provides curb to curb service.  However, I have to schedule them well in advance of any appointment or outing, and there is a definite pick-up time and return time.  If I am at the doctor's office and the doctor is running late, I have to leave when the transit company shows up at the scheduled time to take me home.  Then I have to make another appointment to see the doctor.  With my own van equipped for a motorized wheelchair, I won't be under any time constraints when going places. Also, it would be so much easier in my own van to carry groceries and other purchased items than having to load them in the transit vehicle.</p>
<p>I really never know from day to day how fatigued I wll be and how much pain there will be.  So, I can go shopping, go to church, go to other events and come home when my energy leaves me instead of waiting for my scheduled return time.  A handicapped van will give me the freedom to leave my apartment and do something for as long as my energy holds up.  Also, I would not have to be concerned about an accidental mix-up in the transit schedule, and being left somewhere for an excessive amount of time.</p>
<div>
<p>Any money raised from this campaign will go to purchasing a handicapped van.  If I raise more than enough, then the excess money will go toward auto insurance, gas, and repairs.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help to give me the freedom to go places when I am most able to, without time limitations, and with the peace of mind to know I can return home when I have to. </p>
<p>If you feel you cannot contribute, then you can help me by spreading the word about my campaign to as many people as possible. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<div>We met at Per Se in 2005, about 20 pounds lighter and with less lines, with the ability to work from 11am-2am.  After 3 years we graduated, and fell madly in love.</div>
<div>We began our boutique catering company, Maison Prive in 2008.  Our experience in restaurants such as Blue Hill at Stone Barns (where Jen was the opening Saucier, or meat cook), Bouchon (Jim was the Chef de Cuisine), Per Se (we were both Sauciers) and Cafe Boulud Palm Beach (Jim an opening Chef de Partie) gave an incredible canvas to begin our own art.</div>
<div>After catering for some time in NYC and Greenwich, we moved our lives and babies to Bedford, New York, in search of greener, calmer pastures.  We have waited patiently for a new opportunity to arise, a chance to bring our food into the local retail sector, a chance to feed our community with healthy, affordable options that can sometimes be lacking in smaller towns.  We want everyone to fall madly in love too...with our food, our town, each other and the ritual of the family dinner.</div>
<div>Little known fact: we are also history buffs! We discovered that in the late 1890's, the store G.E. Brown existed right in the village, and served the local community.  We thought that bringing back a part of history would also be a crucial, and much-needed component when thinking about the preservation of the history of Bedford.</div>

<p>The space that we have leased is about 30 years old and is in need of update and much repair, a lot more than we anticipated.  The pre-existing commercial exhaust fan which was attached to the building is no longer up to code and now needs to be replaced.  We will be able to accomplish this with $12,000.</p>
<p>With the remaining funds we would like to transform the existing space into a comfortable store that mirrors the idyllic charm of our town, with good music.  A warm, inviting environment with an amazing coffee program and ambience--it's not just about the food.  We would like to upgrade the heating and A/C systems to make the space more comfortable for everyone. </p>

We have had many late nights discussing what WE want, as Chefs and also parents.  A sandwich that your child will crave, a dessert that you can't live without, great coffee available early!</p>

<br/><div>My name is Eliana Kuan, and I am a secondary 5 student from Royal West Academy. I and 4 of my fellow classmates, are a part of the 'Real Beauty Team."" Together we are putting on a charity Fashion Show in April, to help promote the importance of having a healthy body image. We hope to inspire our fellow classmates to let go of any insecurities they may have about themselves. All the proceeds raised by the show will be donated to ANEB, Anorexie et Boulimie Quebec. </div>
<div>Eating disorders are a problem that I personally do not take lightly, having been previously hospitalized for one myself. The Real Beauty team is passionate about this great cause, and is working extremely hard to make everyone, (both guys and girls), understand that they are beautiful. As teenagers, it is a very easy to let the media influence your decisions and even change the way you feel about yourself. This is what we are trying to change by putting on this fashion show. We are proud to be showcasing real people who are confident and happy in their own skin. As I said before, having had an eating disorder, I know how hard it can be to live with, and I never want others to have to love through what I lived through.</div>
<div>
<h3>Why do we need the funds?</h3>
<div>As I'm sure you can imagine, putting on a fashion show can get expensive! We have already organized many other fundraisers, both inside and outside of school. Unfortunately it is just not enough. Now we need your help! Please donate, any amount helps!</div>

Doctors are currently not available or capable of taking a valuable educational time-out with their patients.
'Google-itis' and 'cyber-hypochondria' are the results of too much information about health found online without any education or context provided, which can cause a great deal of anxiety for patients. 

What is needed is a mini-medical education course for patients to increase their resilience, empowerment, and wisdom.

Doctors are made in educational systems which do not teach or support, to any extent, an ability to relate to their patient. 


Many providers start with a spark of compassion that loses its lustre toward the end of medical school, then nearly extinguished with the rigors of residency. 


Cynicism and higher levels of dissatisfaction builds toward their chosen career path.

For patients:

The Patient's Mini-Medical School is a backstage look at the conversations that caring doctors have with their patients: wise council, ah-ha moments, and true insights that redirect patients in gaining clarity regarding their own medical knowledge and knowledge of themselves.  The course offers real context and education in this new era of information overload.

<p>Through this project, we would like to realize that ideal. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As the CEO of this company, why am I crazy about this product? Well, since I was a child, I have been quite poor with words; I’m a person who has a truly hard time expressing my feelings. </p>
<p>I didn’t achieve significant success at school or work, I didn’t have a lot of friends, and of course, romance never went well for me.  As a result of simply being weak at verbal communication, I have accumulated many regrets in life. </p>I often thought to myself, “If I could only express my feelings without words…”

<p></p>
<p>Because so many people now have smartphones, people can easily communicate verbally and textually with other people, regardless of how far away they may be. Moreover, people have begun to use simple communication methods, like Facebook’s emoticons and the ‘Like’ button; I think that non-verbal communication tools such as these will become increasingly popular from now on. </p>
<p>As a result of the current environment, I set my sights on creating a product based on the concept of ""non-verbal communication,"" and started work on this project.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/746725/files/20140727084556-vision3.jpg?1406475956"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>

<p>We have already held two hackathons for the purpose of developing applications for AYATORI, and even people with no programming experience were able to make AYATORI shine in less than 60 minutes. </p>
<p>From many participants, we heard, “It was simple and easy to make AYATORI light up!” This is why we think AYATORI could also be used as a learning tool when teaching programming. </p>
<p>I hope you will use AYATORI as a way of expanding on your ideas and applications. </p>

""Japan’s Vinclu launches Indiegogo campaign for light communication appcessory""





AYATORI is a smartphone ""appcessory"" that connects people through romantic light. 



Once AYATORI is plugged into your smartphone’s earphone jack,you will open a dreamy way of communication through light by using AYATORI App.




”Appcessory"" is a combined word of app and accessory. 







By combining an application and an accessory, we have created a completely new form of communication flapping outside of the screen.














Currently, we are developing three iPhone APPs that work with AYATORI:
""AYATORI MATCH"",  ""AYATORI LIVE"" and ""AYATORI PAIR"".
All three Apps will be released in this year, and will be available at the same time as AYATORI. 



[AYATORI MATCH] Passing communication App which does not miss a fateful encounter.






You register your interests on the App and then, when you pass by someone who has the same interests, both of your AYATORIs light up. 
When you’re at a party and you want to talk to someone, but you can’t find an opportunity, this can be the first step towards beginning a conversation.



Single Plan is recommended if you are currently single.



[AYATORI LIVE]Live event App that works as advanced penlight and creates a feeling of unity.




At events, AYATORI helps foster a sense of community.
There are many ways to leverage your smartphone’s capabilities and play with AYATORI at an event, including having it light up as you swing your phone, connecting it to a controller managed by an artist, and having it shine when everyone’s energy gets powered up. 
You can enjoy this “light entertainment” with friends at live shows, weddings, sporting events, at karaoke, and other similar events.







Ranger Plan is recommended if you love Live concert or Karaoke. This plan include 5 colors AYATORI that heat up the situation.



[AYATORI PAIR] Nonverbal communication App for lovers.


Words are unnecessary between certain people.
AYATORI can also be used for non-verbal communication with the ""pair"" application that allows partners to express their feelings via light.
Express the feelings you can’t put into words, and when you press a button, your partner’s AYATORI will silently flicker. 





Pair Plan is recommended, if you have love one. This is LOVEBIRD plan. Your other half will be happy to receive this gift you send!
These three app is free for all AYATORI user.In addition, we are planing on increase number of apps that linked to AYATORI.Please look foward to our updates!







“Delivering the feelings that can’t be put into words.” 


Through this project, we would like to realize that ideal. 

As the CEO of this company, why am I crazy about this product? Well, since I was a child, I have been quite poor with words; I’m a person who has a truly hard time expressing my feelings. 
I didn’t achieve significant success at school or work, I didn’t have a lot of friends, and of course, romance never went well for me.  As a result of simply being weak at verbal communication, I have accumulated many regrets in life. I often thought to myself, “If I could only express my feelings without words…”






Because so many people now have smartphones, people can easily communicate verbally and textually with other people, regardless of how far away they may be. Moreover, people have begun to use simple communication methods, like Facebook’s emoticons and the ‘Like’ button; I think that non-verbal communication tools such as these will become increasingly popular from now on. 
As a result of the current environment, I set my sights on creating a product based on the concept of ""non-verbal communication,"" and started work on this project.





AYATORI is a tool that combines light and the Internet to allow you to communicate the feelings you can't put into words with the people around you or your loved one far away.
I hope this product can support people like me, who are not gifted with words.




The source code that illuminates AYATORI is open and available to the public, so anyone is able to build a remote communication device.
(It interacts with Javascript and Objective-C) 
We have released an API so that everyone can use AYATORI as they like, and we also organized a hackathon for developing applications related to AYATORI. 
Hacker Plan is the best match if you are a Hacker.You should be able to understand and hack AYATORI.


We have already held two hackathons for the purpose of developing applications for AYATORI, and even people with no programming experience were able to make AYATORI shine in less than 60 minutes. 
From many participants, we heard, “It was simple and easy to make AYATORI light up!” This is why we think AYATORI could also be used as a learning tool when teaching programming. 
I hope you will use AYATORI as a way of expanding on your ideas and applications. 










AYATORI can create a romantic experience at your event through its original production of light. 
One simple way to achieve this would be by distributing AYATORI accessories and then encouraging participants to install the software. 
It can be used for large events such as parties and concerts, or more everyday events like weddings or after-parties. 
Party Plan and Live Plan is recommended if you are holding an event or party.
Customize




AYATORI’s original design can also be customized, and we can collaborate with companies that have original content and characters. 
We can create original designs to create special experiences for fans from all over the world. 
Partner Plan is recommended if you are the person in charge with company character.




We need your support to bring AYATORI to people around the world! 
Currently, we need initial capital for mass production. Once we've gathered the capital, we'll be able to leverage the strength of our manufacturing partner and we'll be able to create products on a larger scale.
We ask for your heartfelt support! 













People who support our campaign will receive an AYATORI by special delivery in December of 2014. 
If you would really like to try out AYATORI or its companionship applications, or if you’d like to use AYATORI at your next event, please take this opportunity to support our product! 



















AYATORI’s features and design are simple, but we've taken great care creating the beauty of its soft light.
The LED of AYATORI is shining by converting sound that flows from earphone jack into electrical current.
In addition, AYATORI can flash in various patterns by changing wavelength of sound flowing from the L and R stereo sound.
AYATORI is changing the Sound into Light.



The circuit board is equipped with an ultra-bright LED, and takes sound output from the earphone jack and turns it into light. 











For the exterior, we mixed a transparent material with a diffusing agent, testing different combinations until we created a light similar to the weightless flame of a candle. 










AYATORI’s light gently sets the mood, reflecting the dreamy light of your heart, rather than something mechanical and cold.



Why a bird？/ Why ""AYATORI""?




As typified by the carrier pigeon, birds have long held the duty of linking people who are far apart. We at Vinclu Inc. felt that such a symbol fit well with our company ideal, of helping to connect people.



We also wanted AYATORI to encompass the idea of connecting you with others, so we picked the design of a cute bird. 






In June 2013, we used the Japanese site CrowdWorks to run a crowdsourcing campaign to find a name. We chose AYATORI out of over 1,000 ideas. 














AYATORI means a “brightly colored bird,” and comes from the Japanese words “aya” and “tori,” which mean ""color"" and ""bird"" respectively.
AYATORI also has the meaning of “cat’s cradle” in Japanese. 












Cat’s cradle is a game where you take a single piece of string, make it into a circle, and then go
back and forth with a partner, placing it on their fingers and to create different shapes. 







A colorful bird is the perfect match for a product that connects people. 













We also ran a logo crowdsourcing campaign on CrowdWorks, and picked a beautiful design for our brand. 












We've completed the prototype, and are now ready to begin manufacturing on a larger scale. 
With your help we'll be able to immediately move forward with preparations for mass production. 
We'll also be releasing the companion applications by the end of the year, which include everything seen in the video. 
We will start selling AYATORI this year. After that, we will expand our range of companion applications and we'll partner up with other organizations to throw events using AYATORI. 







*As of now, unfortunately, AYATORI does not work with Android. However, in near future, We will develop new AYATORI for Android.













Our company name is vinclu Inc. We began startup to make AYATORI at February 2014.I’d like to create a company that is not just limited to AYATORI, but that makes many products
that connect the web and real world. 














Risks and Challenges
We believe the biggest risk is finding a molding process that will allow us to achieve a steady
quality of beautiful light in mass production. 









We have commissioned a molding professional for this job, and we are working hard to create a
quality product and overcome this challenge. However, if we run into problems with production
costs or the quality of light diffusion, it’s possible there could be manufacturing delays. 







We are planning to deliver up to date information step by step as we go through the process,
and if delivery is delayed, we will contact supporters as soon as possible.

We need your help to launch our new venture.  We are committed to being a zero-waste business model and must purchase our glass bottle stock, launch a vigorous delivery program and complete the aquisition of delivery vehicles
We aim to raise $30,000 to purchase glass bottles, keeping up to 50,000 plastic bottles out of our city's landfills.  Plus, quality, fresh juice is full of living enzymes and it should never be stored in plastic!  THE JUICE BOX chooses glass bottles to protect the integrity of the juice, but also because we can reuse and recycle them. 
What You Get
Support THE JUICE BOX this month and we'll give you fantastic deals on juice.  The sooner you buy, the better the deals.  We open in October and you can redeem your deals for up to 12 months.  Give THE JUICE BOX as a gift and you might change someone's life. 
How We Got HereNearly five years ago, a cancer event in our life made us wake up and realize that we needed to be more mindful of our diet.  We began purchasing and consuming fresh, organic foods. We then moved to a more plant based diet as our palate progressed. We were introduced to juicing as a way to ingest all of the nutrients we needed from veggies.Our passion for raw juice exploded and turned into gourmet juice blends loaded with natural fiber from whole leaf greens, all types of vegetables, and just about every fruit we could find. The result is a diverse menu of highly nutritious juice blends that even finicky children love to drink.  We can't wait to share it with you!  Other Ways You Can Help 
Contributing to our start-up costs is only one way you can help.
Get the word out!  Make some noise about THE JUICE BOX and our pre-sales campaign.

<strong>What size is KappaKit?</strong>
</h4><p>The standard size is 19,7x 19,7x19,7 inches (internal size: 19.69 x 19.09 x 19 inches). On website <a href=""http://www.kappakit.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kappakit.com</a> you can perfect the order by choosing  the size depending on your 3D printer model.</p>
<h4><strong>How many openings does KappaKit have?</strong></h4><p>
</p><p>It has an opening on each side that
allows you to replace the filament or access the printer for any other
operation.</p><h4>
<b>Will be there a hole or notch for other cables (like a networkcable and/or an external filament)?</b><br/>
</h4><p>Yes, on demand we can make a hole or notch for other cables (like a networkcable and/or an external filament). <br/>If you need more holes, it will be necessary to add an extra contribution.</p><h4>How do you prevent depression?<br/>
</h4><p>The fan causes only a small depression, because KappaKit is not airtight: the lower part of KappaKit is opened, in this way the fan produces a small air flow moving from down to up. In order to increase this air flow, you just need to raise up a little bit KappaKit.<br/>We have provided you with a 3D model of some supports that can be used to raise up KappaKit - <a href=""http://www.kappakit.com/model.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">3D Model</a>.</p><h4>Maybe would it be better to blow the clean air into the housing to keep the temperature stable?</h4><p>Yes in some cases, but not in others; it depends on several factors: structure of your 3D printer, type of filament material you use, etc.<br/></p><p>Inside KappaKit you can control the temperature: by changing the height of some supports put at the four corners of KappaKit (we have released an stl file for printing them - <a href=""http://www.kappakit.com/model.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">3D Model</a>) you can increase or reduce the clean air flow coming in and consequently stabilize the temperature.</p><p></p><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1181509/files/20150129034907-kappakit_support.jpg?1422532147"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h4>Can the fan speed be regulated by a motor control or something similar?<br/>
</h4><p>Yes, we have decided to use a 12V fan powered by the same power supply that powers LEDs. In this way it is easier to find or to build by yourself a speed regulator. For example you can use Arduino (or Raspberry, or Beaglebone, etc) together with a temperature sensor, to control the fan speed according to the temperature feedback you get.<br/></p><p></p><p></p></div>","Did you know that 3D printers emit fumes and particles polluting the environment and harmful to health? And that the smells of plastic materials are unpleasant in our homes and offices?Do you want your 3D printer to become a safer object?
That's why we invented
KappaKit, the protective fume hood for your 3D printer.Now you can stop
worrying about 3D printer location. With KappaKit your printer can be
integrated at home, in office, or in any other environment.

Enough with bad smells, enough
with worrying about accidental damages to the printer, maybe while tidying the
officeWhat is KappaKit, exactly? What's its use?
KappaKit is a fume hood
equipped with an exhaust fan with an activated carbon filter that captures fumes,
fine dust and odours, and at the same time protects your printer.
A hood for the makers - portable, practical,
lightweight. Simple and clever, right?
Just place KappaKit on your 3D printer and
printing at home or in any enclosed space will no longer be a problem.
KappaKit is an acrylic ""box"" that is placed on the 3D printer
as a hood. The lower part is empty, so it can be easily placed on top of the
printer or removed in a few seconds.
On the top side it is equipped with a fan and an activated carbon
filter.
When the printer is in operation, simply activate the fan to filter smoke, particles, and odours.
Its body is completely transparent, so you can control how the printing job
proceeds when the printer is in operation.


An easy-to-mount kit
comprising:

5 panels made of transparent acrylic;
1 fan;

1 activated carbon filter (+ 5 replacement filters);
Accessories for power supply (cables, connectors, etc.);
LED lighting.



Installation
and Operation
KappaKit is very easy to install and use.
It consists of 5 acrylic panels that are snap-fit mounted and are fixed with
small screws.
The fan and the activated carbon filter are
fixed on the top panel.
A high-reliability fan. It can be on H24 without any risk of malfunctioning.The power outlets are on the rear panel.
The 3D printer is connected to the power supply inside of the hood.The external power cord provides power to all components of the hood: the printer, the fan, and the LEDs.

Before use, a single button switches on the
suction fan, the LEDs and the printer.In the final version of KappaKit:
there is an opening on each side that
allows you to replace the filament or access the printer for any other
operation;                               there are 3 separate buttons to activate the suction fan, the LEDs and the printer;                                                      
the size is customizable depending on the printer model


KappaKit protects also your 3D printer
against people, avoiding accidental damage.

With its fan and its activated carbon filter, KappaKit
sucks particles. 


KappaKit sucks fumes away.
No more unpleasant smells of melted plastic. KappaKit reduces the noise level of your printer when it is operating.
New model: Kappakit with tube
We have developed a new version of KappaKit: a model with a tube connected to the fan, that expels air directly to the outside. This new version is specifically intended for those who don't ever want to change the filters and prefer carrying all fumes and dust directly outside.Higher print
qualityKappaKit creates a stable
environment for the 3D printer in operation, with a constant internal
temperature, and a protection against currents that can affect print quality by
altering times of solidification of the extruded material.

                               It integrates
into the environment, making better use of space.So you can make better use of the space all around, without
worrying about how to place objects in the vicinity of the printer.
With KappaKit aesthetics is
enhanced. Your printer 3D becomes more aesthetically pleasing.With LED lighting, your printer is even more beautiful and functional, because it allows you to better control the creation of the objects when it is in operation.
Transparent or full colourThe
standard version is transparent but you can request other colours to better
integrate it to your environment. 
However,
the front and back must be transparent in order to control the phases of
printing and filament level of consumption.

KappaKit is available in many colours.
Art and DesignWith the funds raised we also intend to work on the design of KappaKit,
to make it a piece of furniture. The panels will indeed be printed and
personalized with prints of photographs, artwork, or any decoration desired by
the customer.Specifications

<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We're now applying what we learned to a small area of sustainable healthcare known as the Hawaii State Medical Marijuana Program. We are growing, processing and providing  licensed medical marijuana patients with safe, legal access to affordable medicine. Our operations are low cost and scalable. Our patients are replacing expensive pharmaceutical drugs. It's working. We just need your help to accept more patients. </span></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>We Can't Grow Without You!</h3> <p>Your compassion truly makes a difference:</p> <ul>
<li>We need funding to scale our efforts to serve more patients. Our goal is to support 100 patients by the end of next year. In 2016 we hope to support 250 patients. This will create a big impact in our communities.</li> <li>Your money will go directly into all organic growing materials (soil, fertilizers, pots, IMOs. ), energy efficiency measures and water for the plants.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Creating Impact with No Financial Opportunity</h3> <p><b>We are an All Volunteer Organization.</b></p>
<p>There is currently no legal way to obtain medical marijuana without growing and processing yourself or using a caregiver. Distribution may only occur between patient and caregiver. </p> <ul>
<li>Providing safe, legal access to medical marijuana reduces the impact of other drugs in our community. When patients can get a steady supply from a single caregiver, they do not have to go to a drug dealer for pain relief. We want to shrink the black market while supporting patients with debilitating health conditions. We are essentially reducing health care costs for licensed patients and for everyone in Hawaii by reducing dependency on a government healthcare system.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>A Financial Model to Help More Patients</h3>
<p>The Hawaii Medical Marijuana Dispensary Task Force is putting together a program to allow dispensaries in Hawaii. We will apply for this program so we can expand the number of patients we can serve without external funding. </p>
<p>Voters in Hawaii have supported and continue to support medical marijuana legislation. We will support as many licensed patients as possible. A dispensary model is expected in 2016. This will allow us to sell to licensed retailers and increase the number of plants we can grow without external funding. But we have to get to that point. Our current operation is sustainable but cannot grow without your help. </p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>We're doing everything out of pocket with volunteers.</li> <li>Our monthly costs are prohibiting expansion.</li>
<li>Funding goes directly to capital improvements aimed at reducing operational costs. Volunteers will continue to do the hard work. </li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We have several risks inherent in our operation.</p> <ul>
<li>Fungus, mildew and too much rain. We've developed special formulations to control the mildew and fungus but they're expensive at around $50 per plant for organic sprays and IMO soil amendments. </li>
<li>Our growing area is too small. Our plants need more space to be less susceptible to all plant disease. </li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We currently have one 10x20 raised platform with plastic sheeting on metal frame roof). We need more dry area which requires more lights and more energy.</span></li> <li>Our energy costs aren't that high. We maximize everything. But a really big risk is our generator. We've maxed out of watts! We can't add any more lights until we increase energy generation. Fuel, oil, gas treatment and parts are currently more than we can handle. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We've learned how to take the generator apart and fix it it in the dark, in hurricanes at 3am but we just can't keep up with the costs. We desperately need a backup power generation system. We're remote and entirely off the grid. This is great for a lot of reasons but we need to go solar and use the generator for a backup rather than primary energy source.</span>

We're now applying what we learned to a small area of sustainable healthcare known as the Hawaii State Medical Marijuana Program. We are growing, processing and providing  licensed medical marijuana patients with safe, legal access to affordable medicine. Our operations are low cost and scalable. Our patients are replacing expensive pharmaceutical drugs. It's working. We just need your help to accept more patients. 
   We Can't Grow Without You! Your compassion truly makes a difference: 
We need funding to scale our efforts to serve more patients. Our goal is to support 100 patients by the end of next year. In 2016 we hope to support 250 patients. This will create a big impact in our communities. Your money will go directly into all organic growing materials (soil, fertilizers, pots, IMOs. ), energy efficiency measures and water for the plants. 
  Creating Impact with No Financial Opportunity We are an All Volunteer Organization.
There is currently no legal way to obtain medical marijuana without growing and processing yourself or using a caregiver. Distribution may only occur between patient and caregiver.  
Providing safe, legal access to medical marijuana reduces the impact of other drugs in our community. When patients can get a steady supply from a single caregiver, they do not have to go to a drug dealer for pain relief. We want to shrink the black market while supporting patients with debilitating health conditions. We are essentially reducing health care costs for licensed patients and for everyone in Hawaii by reducing dependency on a government healthcare system.


A Financial Model to Help More Patients
The Hawaii Medical Marijuana Dispensary Task Force is putting together a program to allow dispensaries in Hawaii. We will apply for this program so we can expand the number of patients we can serve without external funding. 
Voters in Hawaii have supported and continue to support medical marijuana legislation. We will support as many licensed patients as possible. A dispensary model is expected in 2016. This will allow us to sell to licensed retailers and increase the number of plants we can grow without external funding. But we have to get to that point. Our current operation is sustainable but cannot grow without your help. 


We're doing everything out of pocket with volunteers. Our monthly costs are prohibiting expansion.
Funding goes directly to capital improvements aimed at reducing operational costs. Volunteers will continue to do the hard work. 

  Risks & Challenges  We have several risks inherent in our operation. 
Fungus, mildew and too much rain. We've developed special formulations to control the mildew and fungus but they're expensive at around $50 per plant for organic sprays and IMO soil amendments. 
Our growing area is too small. Our plants need more space to be less susceptible to all plant disease. 
We currently have one 10x20 raised platform with plastic sheeting on metal frame roof). We need more dry area which requires more lights and more energy. Our energy costs aren't that high. We maximize everything. But a really big risk is our generator. We've maxed out of watts! We can't add any more lights until we increase energy generation. Fuel, oil, gas treatment and parts are currently more than we can handle. We've learned how to take the generator apart and fix it it in the dark, in hurricanes at 3am but we just can't keep up with the costs. We desperately need a backup power generation system. We're remote and entirely off the grid. This is great for a lot of reasons but we need to go solar and use the generator for a backup rather than primary energy source.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi my name is Jaye Ward and i am a 45yr old transgendered woman from Hackney in the east end of London in the UK. I am the parent of two incredibly wonderful and rounded girls aged 8 and 3 who, along with their mother have supported and still supoort me. I currently live with my mother, who has dementia, as i am her full time carer. i am nearing my 2nd year from transition and and currently under the care of the Charing Cross gender clinic in Hamersmith where i am on the pathway towards gender reassignment. I desperately need to have a number of Facial Feminzation (FFS) surgical procedures which are NOT covered by the UK's treasured National Health Service (NHS)</p>

I was supported whole heartedly by the school, the parents and the children which helped me immensely. I would have stayed in this wonderful job, but my mother had already started to become ill and in January i had to leave the school to become my mum's full time carer as her needs had become severe and she needed full time care. i have gone from having a job to income support and a carers allowance and now cannot afford this incredibly important and life changing surgery.</p>

What is FFS?
 FFS is a series of surgical procedures carried out by specialist surgeons, where the structural damage caused by testosterone exposure are removed. in short, with the testosterone damage removed as much as possible a face with male features can be reshaped to be feminine. it isn't like cosmetic surgery, where a patients face will be made to look more aesthetically attractive, this surgery basically makes the patient resemble what they would look like if there hadn't been exposed to testosterone in the first place. this is very expensive surgery but i have done considerable research and have decided that i want to get this surgery done by the facial team in Marbella, Spain. I have had 2 consultations with the team and apart from their work being very very good, their after care is exceptional and their rates are very reasonable compared to the surgery being done here in the UK or in the US.

<h3>Summary</h3>
Hello, and thanks for visiting. My name is Taha C., and I am 25 years old as of August 14th, 2012.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>About a month ago I was diagnosed with a heart condition called Aortic Valve Stenosis. It's a life threatening condition that needs to be taken care of soon, and my only remaining option is heart surgery to replace the valve with an artificial one in a few months. That's all the time I have left.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
The surgery will cost nearly $120,000 and is not covered by my family's insurance. All the medical bills will be purely out of pocket for us, and we simply cannot afford this, and have no other means of financial support.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm starting this campaign off at a fraction of the amout because, at this point, I'm still trying to pay for the checkups and other diagnostic tests. So far I've had to get EKG's, blood tests and EchoCardiograms, and am due for another Echo in a couple weeks. Most of these have also been out of pocket and my current income doesn't pay nearly enough to cover even half the costs.</div>

<p>Mammoth Hunters is an <strong>online virtual physical trainer</strong> based on the <strong>PaleoTraining </strong>Method. It is designed to help you improve your physical performance in a very short time.</p>
<p>Mammoth Hunters is founded on the <strong>latest scientific discoveries</strong> in sport physiology and a true understanding of how humans move. It will help you recover the natural way to exercise.</p>
<p>Mammoth Hunters’ workouts are short, variable, and surprising, which makes them more fun and effective than a normal training program. You can do them anytime and anywhere, as they are based on bodyweight and don’t require any external equipment.</p>
<p>Mammoth Hunters is a personalized program. It adapts the training to your personal needs and fitness level.</p>
<p><img alt=""mamut2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/811681/pictures/full/20130515095419-mamut2.jpg?1368636865"" src="""" style="""" title=""mamut2""/></p>
<h1 style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-large; color: #f90;"">Why did we create Mammoth Hunters?</h1>
<p>Because we are health professionals and have seen how PaleoTraining helps people be more physically active and healthier. Now we want to spread the word.</p>
<p>Mammoth Hunters was created as a tool to <strong>make the PaleoTraining accessible to everybody</strong>.</p>
<p>With Mammoth Hunters we want:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To help people do sports properly – an active person is a healthier and happier person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide a new training method that respects the natural movements of human bodies, which is adapted to the needs of each person and which helps people perform at their maximum potential with minimal time investment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To implement the latest scientific discoveries into our trainings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-large; color: #f90;"">What is the PaleoTraining?</h1>
<p>We all know that physical activity is good for our bodies and minds but the busy and sedentary lives we live don’t give us many opportunities to move. There are days when our physical activity is limited to pressing the buttons of our remote control or to raising a hand to hail a cab.</p>
<p>In addition, <strong>not all the sport we do is good for us</strong>. Many people engage in grueling gym workouts but they never reach their goals. This causes <strong>frustration, discouragement and can even have a negative impact on their wellbeing</strong>. Our bodies do not understand why we run on a treadmill going nowhere or why we lift weights to get bigger biceps without any purpose. These exercises are perceived as meaningless wastes of energy and are not rewarded.</p>
<p>At the end, this lack of positive feedback makes us lose hope and discourages us from going to the gym with excuses such as “I don’t have time”, “It is too expensive” or “I don’t get the results I want” … and then we feel guilty…</p>
<p><img alt=""mamut3"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/811687/pictures/full/20130515095608-mamut3.jpg?1368636973"" src="""" style="""" title=""mamut3""/></p>
<p><strong>PaleoTraining was created to address these incoherencies. </strong></p>
<p>The way humans exercise was not invented by coaches in a sport physiology lab. It was never meant to be done in gym or in track and field sessions.<strong> We humans developed our abilities over thousands of years to survive in a natural environment very different from the world we live today. In other words, physical activity has never been an objective by itself but rather a tool to gather food or escape a predator</strong>.</p>
<p>With PaleoTraining we rediscover this ancestral way of doing exercise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exercise is done while fasting – have you ever seen a lion chasing a gazelle after eating a big meal?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercises simulate natural movements that suit our nature and only use bodyweight loading - this is what our body understands and rewards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training sessions are variable and surprising – in real life you never know when you’ll have to run after a rabbit or leap from a cliff, narrowly escaping a bear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is a training method that is healthier and more effective because it is attuned to our physiology and promotes the kind of movements that are natural to us.</p>

<p>We have been working on Mammoth Hunters for more than two years, putting our time, energy and hopes into this project. Six months ago we launched a BETA version to test the concept and today more than 200 people use Mammoth Hunters with very positive results on their physical performance and health.</p>
<p>Now we want to go one step further. We want to improve on our current version and launch a full-featured application. In order to do this, we need your financial support.</p>

<p>With your donations we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Add more sessions to our program </strong>– So far we have implemented 4, but there are 20 more on the pipeline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improve the usability and design</strong> - we want to make Mammoth Hunters more intuitive and simpler to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improve the personalization algorithm</strong> – We want to create a fully personalized training program that tracks your progress and adapts the workouts day by day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make Mammoth Hunters more social</strong> – People live in tribes and this is how we want you to train. We want to include collective workouts and let you share your experiences with other hunters. If our workouts are fun now, imagine when you can do them in groups!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a mobile application</strong> – To make Mammoth Hunters more portable so that you can do a workout even in the middle of the jungle. This will also help us provide a more personalized training program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Start a scientific research program</strong> – Mammoth Hunters is based on scientific research and we want to contribute to the scientific community. Users will have the option to volunteer to try different programs to help us learn how to improve their health through exercise.</p>

<h1 style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-large; color: #f90;"">I want to know more about the Paleo movement</h1>
<p><img alt=""mamut4"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/811689/pictures/full/20130515095620-mamut4.jpg?1368636985"" src="""" style="""" title=""mamut4""/></p>
<p>The PaleoTraining is part of the Paleo movement. This movement is founded over the fact that humans evolved for millions of years in environmental conditions that are very different from the world we live today. What we ate, the amount of sun light we were exposed, the type of activities we had to do to survive etc. shaped our genome.</p>
<p>Persistent changes in the genome of a species happen over long periods of time or over high environmental pressures. So although the world around us has changed dramatically in a few years the adaptations of our genome are still pretty much the same as the ones from the Paleolithic age.</p>
<p>This cultural movement is strongly rooted in scientific evidence from a myriad of disciplines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Archeological and anthropological data show that our pre-agricultural ancestors did not suffer from most of the diseases that are common nowadays: cancer, obesity, cardiovascular diseases or autoimmune problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Molecular biology, immunology and endocrinology studies have identified the molecular pathways that support the thesis of the Paleo movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treatments based on a Paleolithic Diet and a recovery of the ancestral lifestyle (sleep patterns restoration, exercise, inclusion of micronutrients on the diet) have shown there efficacy on resolving several diseases and the improvement of subjective indexes of health and wellbeing. This has been proven both with clinical case studies and with population based analysis.</p>

<p>Todos sabemos que el deporte es saludable para nuestro cuerpo y mente. Pero nuestra vida tan ocupada y sedentaria no nos da muchas oportunidades de movernos. Hay días que nuestra actividad física se limita a apretar el botón del mando a distancia o a levantar la mano para pedir un taxi.</p>
<p>Además <strong>no todo el deporte que hacemos nos es saludable.</strong> Mucha gente se impone duras horas de gimnasio pero no consigue llegar a los objetivos que se han marcado y eso les causa<strong> frustración y desánimo e incluso alteraciones en su organismo.</strong> Cuando corremos en un tapiz rodante sin desplazarnos o levantamos una pesa para ejercitar el bíceps, el cuerpo no entiende ese gasto calórico innecesario. Al final ello puede desanimarnos y que dejemos de ir al gimnasio, con excusas como “no tengo tiempo”, “no tengo dinero para un gimnasio” o “no obtengo los resultados deseados”; y hacernos sentir culpables…</p>
<p><img alt=""mamut3"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/811687/pictures/full/20130515095608-mamut3.jpg?1368636973"" src="""" style="""" title=""mamut3""/></p>
<p><strong>El PaleoTraining nace como respuesta a estas incoherencias. </strong></p>
<p>La manera en que los humanos hacemos ejercicio no se estableció ni en los gimnasios, ni en las pistas de atletismo ni por supuesto en los laboratorios de fisiología deportiva. <strong>Los seres humanos desarrollamos nuestras habilidades a lo largo de miles de años para sobrevivir en un entorno natural  </strong>muy diferente al que vivimos hoy en día. En esos tiempos <strong>la actividad física cumplía una función.</strong> Es decir, el movimiento físico nunca ha sido un fin en sí mismo sino una herramienta para por ejemplo conseguir comida o escapar de un depredador.</p>
<p>Con el PaleoTraining recuperamos la manera ancestral de hacer ejercicio del ser humano:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>El ejercicio se hace en ayunas, como si fuéramos a buscar comida – ¿habéis visto alguna vez a un león corriendo detrás de una gacela después de un festín?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Los ejercicios se hacen con del propio cuerpo como carga y simulan movimientos coherentes con nuestra naturaleza.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Las sesiones de entrenamiento son siempre variables y sorprendentes – en la vida real nunca sabes cuándo va tocar ir detrás de un conejo o saltar un acantilado escapando de un oso.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>El resultado es un método de entrenamiento más saludable y eficaz porque está en sintonía con nuestra fisiología y potencia los movimientos que nos son naturales.</p>

What is Mammoth Hunters?

Mammoth Hunters is an online virtual physical trainer based on the PaleoTraining Method. It is designed to help you improve your physical performance in a very short time.
Mammoth Hunters is founded on the latest scientific discoveries in sport physiology and a true understanding of how humans move. It will help you recover the natural way to exercise.
Mammoth Hunters’ workouts are short, variable, and surprising, which makes them more fun and effective than a normal training program. You can do them anytime and anywhere, as they are based on bodyweight and don’t require any external equipment.
Mammoth Hunters is a personalized program. It adapts the training to your personal needs and fitness level.

Why did we create Mammoth Hunters?
Because we are health professionals and have seen how PaleoTraining helps people be more physically active and healthier. Now we want to spread the word.
Mammoth Hunters was created as a tool to make the PaleoTraining accessible to everybody.
With Mammoth Hunters we want:


To help people do sports properly – an active person is a healthier and happier person.


To provide a new training method that respects the natural movements of human bodies, which is adapted to the needs of each person and which helps people perform at their maximum potential with minimal time investment.


To implement the latest scientific discoveries into our trainings.


What is the PaleoTraining?
We all know that physical activity is good for our bodies and minds but the busy and sedentary lives we live don’t give us many opportunities to move. There are days when our physical activity is limited to pressing the buttons of our remote control or to raising a hand to hail a cab.
In addition, not all the sport we do is good for us. Many people engage in grueling gym workouts but they never reach their goals. This causes frustration, discouragement and can even have a negative impact on their wellbeing. Our bodies do not understand why we run on a treadmill going nowhere or why we lift weights to get bigger biceps without any purpose. These exercises are perceived as meaningless wastes of energy and are not rewarded.
At the end, this lack of positive feedback makes us lose hope and discourages us from going to the gym with excuses such as “I don’t have time”, “It is too expensive” or “I don’t get the results I want” … and then we feel guilty…

PaleoTraining was created to address these incoherencies. 
The way humans exercise was not invented by coaches in a sport physiology lab. It was never meant to be done in gym or in track and field sessions. We humans developed our abilities over thousands of years to survive in a natural environment very different from the world we live today. In other words, physical activity has never been an objective by itself but rather a tool to gather food or escape a predator.
With PaleoTraining we rediscover this ancestral way of doing exercise:


Exercise is done while fasting – have you ever seen a lion chasing a gazelle after eating a big meal?


Exercises simulate natural movements that suit our nature and only use bodyweight loading - this is what our body understands and rewards.


Training sessions are variable and surprising – in real life you never know when you’ll have to run after a rabbit or leap from a cliff, narrowly escaping a bear.


The result is a training method that is healthier and more effective because it is attuned to our physiology and promotes the kind of movements that are natural to us.

Why do you need my help?
We have been working on Mammoth Hunters for more than two years, putting our time, energy and hopes into this project. Six months ago we launched a BETA version to test the concept and today more than 200 people use Mammoth Hunters with very positive results on their physical performance and health.
Now we want to go one step further. We want to improve on our current version and launch a full-featured application. In order to do this, we need your financial support.

With your donations we will:


Add more sessions to our program – So far we have implemented 4, but there are 20 more on the pipeline.


Improve the usability and design - we want to make Mammoth Hunters more intuitive and simpler to use.


Improve the personalization algorithm – We want to create a fully personalized training program that tracks your progress and adapts the workouts day by day.


Make Mammoth Hunters more social – People live in tribes and this is how we want you to train. We want to include collective workouts and let you share your experiences with other hunters. If our workouts are fun now, imagine when you can do them in groups!


Create a mobile application – To make Mammoth Hunters more portable so that you can do a workout even in the middle of the jungle. This will also help us provide a more personalized training program.


Start a scientific research program – Mammoth Hunters is based on scientific research and we want to contribute to the scientific community. Users will have the option to volunteer to try different programs to help us learn how to improve their health through exercise.


Who are we?
With all this talk and we forgot to introduce ourselves!
The Mammoth Hunters team is composed by a multidisciplinary team fully committed to the PaleoTraining:

I want to know more about the Paleo movement

The PaleoTraining is part of the Paleo movement. This movement is founded over the fact that humans evolved for millions of years in environmental conditions that are very different from the world we live today. What we ate, the amount of sun light we were exposed, the type of activities we had to do to survive etc. shaped our genome.
Persistent changes in the genome of a species happen over long periods of time or over high environmental pressures. So although the world around us has changed dramatically in a few years the adaptations of our genome are still pretty much the same as the ones from the Paleolithic age.
This cultural movement is strongly rooted in scientific evidence from a myriad of disciplines:


Archeological and anthropological data show that our pre-agricultural ancestors did not suffer from most of the diseases that are common nowadays: cancer, obesity, cardiovascular diseases or autoimmune problems.


Molecular biology, immunology and endocrinology studies have identified the molecular pathways that support the thesis of the Paleo movement.


Treatments based on a Paleolithic Diet and a recovery of the ancestral lifestyle (sleep patterns restoration, exercise, inclusion of micronutrients on the diet) have shown there efficacy on resolving several diseases and the improvement of subjective indexes of health and wellbeing. This has been proven both with clinical case studies and with population based analysis.


Thank you very much for your help!

¿Qué es el PaleoTraining?
Todos sabemos que el deporte es saludable para nuestro cuerpo y mente. Pero nuestra vida tan ocupada y sedentaria no nos da muchas oportunidades de movernos. Hay días que nuestra actividad física se limita a apretar el botón del mando a distancia o a levantar la mano para pedir un taxi.
Además no todo el deporte que hacemos nos es saludable. Mucha gente se impone duras horas de gimnasio pero no consigue llegar a los objetivos que se han marcado y eso les causa frustración y desánimo e incluso alteraciones en su organismo. Cuando corremos en un tapiz rodante sin desplazarnos o levantamos una pesa para ejercitar el bíceps, el cuerpo no entiende ese gasto calórico innecesario. Al final ello puede desanimarnos y que dejemos de ir al gimnasio, con excusas como “no tengo tiempo”, “no tengo dinero para un gimnasio” o “no obtengo los resultados deseados”; y hacernos sentir culpables…

El PaleoTraining nace como respuesta a estas incoherencias. 
La manera en que los humanos hacemos ejercicio no se estableció ni en los gimnasios, ni en las pistas de atletismo ni por supuesto en los laboratorios de fisiología deportiva. Los seres humanos desarrollamos nuestras habilidades a lo largo de miles de años para sobrevivir en un entorno natural  muy diferente al que vivimos hoy en día. En esos tiempos la actividad física cumplía una función. Es decir, el movimiento físico nunca ha sido un fin en sí mismo sino una herramienta para por ejemplo conseguir comida o escapar de un depredador.
Con el PaleoTraining recuperamos la manera ancestral de hacer ejercicio del ser humano:


El ejercicio se hace en ayunas, como si fuéramos a buscar comida – ¿habéis visto alguna vez a un león corriendo detrás de una gacela después de un festín?


Los ejercicios se hacen con del propio cuerpo como carga y simulan movimientos coherentes con nuestra naturaleza.


Las sesiones de entrenamiento son siempre variables y sorprendentes – en la vida real nunca sabes cuándo va tocar ir detrás de un conejo o saltar un acantilado escapando de un oso.


El resultado es un método de entrenamiento más saludable y eficaz porque está en sintonía con nuestra fisiología y potencia los movimientos que nos son naturales.

¿Y de qué servirá mi ayuda?
Hace dos años que estamos trabajando en Mammoth Hunters. Hasta ahora hemos puesto nuestro tiempo, energía e ilusión en el proyecto. Hemos creado una versión BETA para probar nuestra idea y más de 200 personas la están utilizando con resultados muy positivos.
Ahora queremos dar un paso más. Queremos lanzar la versión completa de la aplicación, pero para esto nos hace falta financiación.

Con vuestras aportaciones queremos:


Ampliar el tipo de sesiones disponibles - Por el momento hay cuatro, pero ya tenemos diseñadas más de veinte.


Mejorar la usabilidad y la apariencia - Que sea más intuitivo y gráficamente atractivo.


Mejorar el algoritmo de personalización - Queremos que Mammoth Hunters sea aún más personalizado, y que os haga un seguimiento diario de vuestra progresión.


Socializar Mammoth Hunters - Queremos que podáis uniros en tribus, planificar entrenamientos colectivos y compartir vuestras experiencias con otros cazadores. Es divertido entrenar y lo será mucho más en grupo.


Hacer Mammoth Hunters más móvil - Queremos crear aplicaciones que permitan llevaros MH con vosotros, que os sintáis aún más libres practicando deporte allá donde estéis, y que hagan un seguimiento más personalizado de las sesiones.


Empezar un programa de investigación científica - Queremos que Mammoth Hunters sea riguroso y científicamente probado. Para esto pediremos voluntarios entre nuestros cazadores para participar en programas de investigación sobre cómo mejorar nuestra salud a través del deporte.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>GOAL 1: Raise enough funds ($9900) to research, develop, test, and stock 15 deliciously effective teas.  </strong></p>
<p>This would bring our line of teas to 20 ""Help"" teas. We currently offer Help Me Sleep, Help Mama Sleep, Help Baby Sleep, Help My Back, and Help My Stomach. I scraped together some money for the tasting batch of herbs for Help Me Not Slap a Bitch (for menstrual complaints). Help My Hot Flashes and Help My Arthritis are currently in research phase. Unfortunately we've run out of funds, so we're not able to move forward to the development phase for these two teas.  I've used up my savings and will be selling my hair (<a href=""http://buyandsellhair.com/ads/17-virgin-brown-w-gorgeous-auburn-highlights/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">buyandsellhair.com</a>) to fund stocking of herbs once Help Me Not Slap a Bitch is perfected.</p>

<h1>IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO BURN CALORIES WITHOUT CHANGING YOUR LIFESTYLE OR GRUELING WORKOUTS... </h1>
<p>As the world changes and evolves, so does technology and the way people lose weight.  The world, for many of us, is getting fatter and in many ways less healthy.  Think about it, since 1980 the obesity rate has doubled affecting almost 40% of Americans today.  Lifestyles are increasingly less active.  Not to mention the way food is being processed will undoubtedly make most people gain weight.  As our world becomes more complicated we have less time to exercise and to watch what we eat. The Cooling Belt™ will revolutionize how people lose weight.  </p>
<p>Imagine a world
where people can lose weight without changing their lifestyle.<span>  Imagine a world where people can lose weight
without eating less or exercising.  When
we think about losing weight, most of us think about calories in and calories
out.  We think about what or how much we
eat and how many calories we can burn through exercise.  Now, imagine being able to lose weight by
doubling your metabolism or burning 500-1000 calories per day without grueling workouts. </span></p>
<p><b>Introducing
the Cooling Belt™ Weight Loss Solution!  </b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/807827/files/20140823233447-Product_PIC_LARGE_-_JPEG.jpg?1408862087"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>The Cooling
Belt™ uses the latest technology in thermodynamics (also known as
“thermogenesis”) to burn calories.<span>  Thermodynamics
or cold therapy is the process of burning calories when the body warms up to
its normal core temperature of 98.6 degrees after being cooled down.  <b>The calories are burned as the body’s
metabolism speeds up to get the body back its normal core temperature of 98.6

<h4><i><b>Wrap Up, Cool Down &amp; Shed Pounds!</b></i></h4>
<br/><p>The science
behind the Cooling Belt™ is a simple concept which everyone has probably experienced
in everyday life; a splash of cold water on the face or how drinking a cold
beverage is refreshing and invigorating. Afterward you feel more awake and
alert. Cold has this affect because it speeds up metabolism. </p>
<p>Several years
ago former NASA scientist Ray Cronise went on a quest to lose weight. He had
heard that Michael Phelps, Olympic swimmer, was eating about 12,000 calories a
day.<span>  After doing the math and science
behind it, he concluded that Michael was burning only about 7000 calories a day
and there was a 5000 calorie leftover balance which should have been stored as
fat.</span></p>
<p>Obviously
Michael Phelps is pretty ripped, so Ray Cronise realized it was his body’s need to stay
warm when he's in the pool which caused him to burn the balance of the
calories. So Ray Cronise started using
cold therapy to lose weight and loss 30 pounds in the first six weeks.<span>  </span></p>

<p>The problem
with cold therapy is we can’t keep ice packs on our skin too long without
getting ice pack burn, or take ice baths without it becoming painfully
uncomfortable after just a few minutes.<span>  The Cooling Belt™
technology solves that problem so that you can wear it comfortably with no side
effects. You will hardly know that your body is cooling down unlike wearing an
ice pack against the skin. The Cooling Belt™ is built with the latest materials
so that you can wear it against your body without freezing the skin because you
are actually cooling the body from the inside out.  This is known as cooling down your core body temperature.<br/></span></p>
<p>The Cooling
Belt™, if worn for at least 45 minutes per day, will help people to lose up to
500 to 1000 calories per day or more without changing their lifestyle, starving
themselves, or doing monotonous hours of killer workouts.</p>

<br/><h3>Who Are We…</h3>
<p>It started with just one
woman’s quest to lose weight.<span>  Like many,
she had experimented with more than her share of weight loss products.
Eventually, she found herself at a cold therapy clinic in the upscale
neighborhood of </span>Plano, Texas.<span> 
She was disappointed when she learned that the treatments would cost
thousands of dollars.  However, she
believed in this new technology so much that she persevered, researched, and
then developed the Cooling Belt™.  Now in her 60’s, Janice Mackey has lost more
than 60 lbs with literally no exercise regimen or change in her eating habits. 
Janice is a grandmother and didn't think losing weight would be this easy at her age.  She has kept the weight off for the first time in her life and is feeling and
looking better than she ever has. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/771660/files/20140806231936-new.jpg?1407392376"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Janice began giving the
belt away to family and friends.<span>  In
December of 2013 my son was 180lbs at only 11 years old. He was destined to be
overweight and non-athletic. Furthermore, my wife and I had deep concerns
regarding his overall health in general but our major concern was getting his
weight under control.  He was getting
bigger and bigger with no end in sight. 
So we made the decision to have him try the Cooling Belt™.  Our son lost 40 lbs. in 4 months.</span></p>

Eventually, she found herself at a cold therapy clinic in the upscale
neighborhood of Plano, Texas. 
She was disappointed when she learned that the treatments would cost
thousands of dollars.  However, she
believed in this new technology so much that she persevered, researched, and
then developed the Cooling Belt™.  Now in her 60’s, Janice Mackey has lost more
than 60 lbs with literally no exercise regimen or change in her eating habits. 
Janice is a grandmother and didn't think losing weight would be this easy at her age.  She has kept the weight off for the first time in her life and is feeling and
looking better than she ever has. 


Janice began giving the
belt away to family and friends.  In
December of 2013 my son was 180lbs at only 11 years old. He was destined to be
overweight and non-athletic. Furthermore, my wife and I had deep concerns
regarding his overall health in general but our major concern was getting his
weight under control.  He was getting
bigger and bigger with no end in sight. 
So we made the decision to have him try the Cooling Belt™.  Our son lost 40 lbs. in 4 months.
Lost 40 lbs. in 4 months



We are so excited and believe in this project
so much that we just want to share it with everyone!  And we decided to help Janice Mackey bring this product to the market.

It became important to us
as many of us were either overweight or have family members who suffered from
obesity.  After learning that we can
lose weight through thermodynamics (cooling down) without side effects, and we
didn’t have to starve and go through killer workouts… we felt that everyone
should know about this technology and know that the struggle is OVER! 

Our Goal
TeamCool is committed to
bringing people an easier, affordable way to lose pounds or manage their weight
without a major change in their lifestyle.  TeamCool is committed to helping
people live healthier lives through weight loss.  We strive for product

<p><br/></p>
<p>We have had inquiries into more details about the way the GULP system works. We remain somewhat vague about the technology patent that we hold based on several reasons. One of which is that many of the components used in our system are purchased and warranted through other patent holders of specific items. Think of individual pieces that are required to build a car. Each one of these pieces are specially designed for a purpose. We would require that everyone seeing this specific information to sign confidentiality agreements based on our contracts with our suppliers and manufacturers. All components are existing technologies, but we are the only company that holds the technology patent to combine them within one system for the purpose of cleaning water. Due to the liability aspect of confidentiality laws, we are bound by our agreements with our manufacturing partners and license holders to keep some information confidential. None, of the parts of the Gulp System are theoretical, they are all currently being used individually for specialty or commercial purposes. Thank you for your understanding.<br/></p>
<p>THIS IS WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU:</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Over the past 8 years, we have been perfecting this technology to bring to the world. Gulp Clear Water has developed a chemical free water purification system capable of removing 99.999% of contaminants out of any water source. </span></p>
<p><b>DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS?!?</b></p>
<p>Around the world, water is currently cleaned by adding chemicals to burn out the harmful contaminants that are present. The current processes used are proven harmful to humans. With the Gulp Clear Water purification system, people around the world will be able to consume, bath and irrigate with pure, sustainable water.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">We are here to set a new standard to combat the Global Water Crisis.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Combining the most cutting edge technology available, the Gulp System:</p>
<ul>
<li>is configurable to purify up to hundreds of millions of gallons per day </li>
<li>uses NO chemicals</li>
<li>uses NO reverse osmosis or forward osmosis (the current standard for purification)</li>
<li>uses NO outdated UV technology</li>
<li>uses NO heat</li>
<li>uses NO ozone treatment</li>
<li>renders current desalination obsolete</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<p>By utilizing a proprietary and programmable blend of advanced purification media, along with the next generation of germicidal technology, we are able to deliver pure, inexpensive water from any source. </p>

<p><b>Recycling</b></p>
<p>When the Gulp Clear Water System follows an electrocoagulation unit, which removes the larger debris, even contaminated waste can become the purest drinking water. </p>
<p>This process can be utilized for drinking water, agriculture, aqua culture, semi conductor grade, or industrial. </p>
<p>The Gulp Clear Water System revolutionizes water treatment processes, such as treating Leachate (the ground water runoff
from landfills) and Frack water in an environmentally sustainable way, at a fraction of
current cost.  It can also be utilized to purify rain water, greywater, and groundwater for re-use.</p>
<p>In addition, the Gulp Clear Water System is made of 100% recyclable materials.</p>
<p><b>Municipal</b></p>
<p>Municipal water supplies and well-water supplies are fighting to stay above drinking water standards across the United States and around the world. By placing Gulp Clear Water Systems within existing municipal water treatment facilities, we will provide a non-chemical, low cost alternative to produce water that exceeds current drinking water standards to every household and business. Whether it is for drinking, bathing, or watering the garden, pure water will be used.</p>
<p><b>Environmental</b></p>
<p>Due to severe environmental conditions, several of the world's largest lakes are currently dwindling and more toxic than ever. By implementing the Gulp Clear Water System, even the most contaminated lakes can be restored to their natural, life-giving state.</p>

YES, THIS IS VERY REAL. EBOLA CAN BE CURED AND STOPPED FROM SPREADING BY IMPLEMENTING THIS LIFE SAVING TECHNOLOGY. 
THIS SAME TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED TO PURIFY AIR AND SURFACES, AS WELL. 
IT IS OFFICIALLY IN YOUR HANDS AT THIS POINT. HOW DO YOU TELL THE WORLD THAT YOU CAN STOP A PANDEMIC DEAD IN IT'S TRACKS?
THANK YOU. BLESSINGS. 
The following is our original campaign, before water took the back seat to this massive EBOLA outbreak. The rest of the campaign explains the water technology. Please IGNORE the $$$ amount being asked for. That was for the original SALTON SEA PROJECT. Whatever resources will be used to make BLOOD PURIFICATION systems. 

We are going to show the world how to restore and protect valuable resources, clean toxic lakes, refill reservoirs, and introduce a first-of-its-kind biomimicry water purification and energy recovery system.

Introducing the GULP CLEAR WATER SYSTEM, for purifying drinking water, contaminated wells, agricultural runoff, waste water, landfill leachate, and sea water.

Our process will set a new benchmark for water quality and alternative energy standards worldwide.


In this campaign we:



Explain the Gulp Clear Water System to the best of our ability

Give examples of the uses for the system 
Give you some AWESOME facts about Gulp Clear Water LLC
Show you how you can get involved in something new and good for you.
Give you a price break-down
Then tell you more about us, our perks we offer, and answers some FAQ

Please check out the full campaign, there is a LOT of information involved.

Remember-- YOU ARE OUR VOICE! Help us PURIFY the WORLD's WATER SUPPLY!





We have had inquiries into more details about the way the GULP system works. We remain somewhat vague about the technology patent that we hold based on several reasons. One of which is that many of the components used in our system are purchased and warranted through other patent holders of specific items. Think of individual pieces that are required to build a car. Each one of these pieces are specially designed for a purpose. We would require that everyone seeing this specific information to sign confidentiality agreements based on our contracts with our suppliers and manufacturers. All components are existing technologies, but we are the only company that holds the technology patent to combine them within one system for the purpose of cleaning water. Due to the liability aspect of confidentiality laws, we are bound by our agreements with our manufacturing partners and license holders to keep some information confidential. None, of the parts of the Gulp System are theoretical, they are all currently being used individually for specialty or commercial purposes. Thank you for your understanding.
THIS IS WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU:
Over the past 8 years, we have been perfecting this technology to bring to the world. Gulp Clear Water has developed a chemical free water purification system capable of removing 99.999% of contaminants out of any water source. 
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS?!?
Around the world, water is currently cleaned by adding chemicals to burn out the harmful contaminants that are present. The current processes used are proven harmful to humans. With the Gulp Clear Water purification system, people around the world will be able to consume, bath and irrigate with pure, sustainable water.
We are here to set a new standard to combat the Global Water Crisis.

Combining the most cutting edge technology available, the Gulp System:

is configurable to purify up to hundreds of millions of gallons per day 
uses NO chemicals
uses NO reverse osmosis or forward osmosis (the current standard for purification)
uses NO outdated UV technology
uses NO heat
uses NO ozone treatment
renders current desalination obsolete


By utilizing a proprietary and programmable blend of advanced purification media, along with the next generation of germicidal technology, we are able to deliver pure, inexpensive water from any source. 
               
                                                 
This process utilizes both FDA approved technologies and the United States CDC (BAT) Best Available Technologies for water purification. 

With our advanced technologies, we utilize UVC Germicidal LED's for killing microorganisms at the optimal germicidal wavelength, ensuring that even the strongest microorganisms are precisely disassembled at the thiamine base level. This wavelength of light also breaks down chemicals into less harmful sub-components in a process known as Photo-chemical Oxidation. 
All current technology is not even close in efficacy and efficiency.
As amazing as this is, this is only one component of our purification process. 

The result? The following are examples of contaminants removed, but are not limited to:





Fertilizers ex: Nitrates and Phosphates

Pesticides ex: Organophosphates and Carbamates
Pharmaceuticals ex: Antibiotics and Hormones

Heavy Metals ex: Lead and Mercury

Industrial Pollutants ex: Benzene, Hexavalent Chromium, Flouride

Microbial Cysts ex: Cryptosporidium and Giardia

Bacteria ex: E. coli and Legionella (Legionnaires)

Viruses ex: Malaria, West Nile, Ebola
Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCB's) ex: Dielectric and Coolant Fluids
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC's) ex: Chlorinated Byproducts and Total Trihalomethanes (TTHM'S) 

Radioactive Isotopes ex: Radium and Strontium

and MORE
With the world’s first fully integrated system of advanced hardware, software, and purification technologies, we are able to offer the template that will combat the global water crisis. 
This is the first and only computational, systematic, precision set of technologies that is completely configurable, scale-able, compatible, and up-gradable. 





Due to the sensitive legal nature of the specific technologies utilized by the Gulp Clear Water System, we are unable to disclose specific proprietary information or labeling of the figure shown above.



﻿The Gulp Clear Water System has been specifically designed with the ability to be deployed as a single mobile unit or an integrated fleet for humanitarian aid or disaster relief. Constructed for easy transport, the system can be calibrated and monitored via satellite anywhere in the world to deliver pure water for proactive solutions and disaster recovery. These systems can be placed on docks or on barges as well, for purification of early onset algae blooms or other pollution inflow to minimize contamination before it has a chance to spread.

Recycling
When the Gulp Clear Water System follows an electrocoagulation unit, which removes the larger debris, even contaminated waste can become the purest drinking water. 
This process can be utilized for drinking water, agriculture, aqua culture, semi conductor grade, or industrial. 
The Gulp Clear Water System revolutionizes water treatment processes, such as treating Leachate (the ground water runoff
from landfills) and Frack water in an environmentally sustainable way, at a fraction of
current cost.  It can also be utilized to purify rain water, greywater, and groundwater for re-use.
In addition, the Gulp Clear Water System is made of 100% recyclable materials.
Municipal
Municipal water supplies and well-water supplies are fighting to stay above drinking water standards across the United States and around the world. By placing Gulp Clear Water Systems within existing municipal water treatment facilities, we will provide a non-chemical, low cost alternative to produce water that exceeds current drinking water standards to every household and business. Whether it is for drinking, bathing, or watering the garden, pure water will be used.
Environmental
Due to severe environmental conditions, several of the world's largest lakes are currently dwindling and more toxic than ever. By implementing the Gulp Clear Water System, even the most contaminated lakes can be restored to their natural, life-giving state.










Keith Ervin, the patent holder for Gulp technology, received the ""Early Planning Grant"" (EPG) in 2009 from the Wisconsin Entrepreneurs' Network for the Gulp Clear Water purification technology. 
Gulp Clear Water LLC is currently working with one of the world's most advanced Aqua Culture companies to upgrade their current system. 
The world is currently experiencing one of the worst drought and pollution crisis situations in history.
In America, the drinking water standards haven't improved since 1975.
The first Nobel Peace Prize for Physiology or Medicine winner of the 20th century was Niels Ryberg Finsen in 1903 for his cure of Lupus Vulgaris (Tuberculosis Luposa) with Ultra Violet light. 
Agriculture is a major user of ground and surface water in the United States, accounting for approximately 80 percent of the Nation's consumptive water use and over 90 percent in many Western States.

Approximately 780 million people lack access to safe drinking water, that's approximately 1 in 9 people.
3.4 million people die each year as a result of unclean drinking water. That is almost the entire city of Los Angeles.
1 child dies every 21 seconds from a water related disease.

We need your support to show the world that there is a solution, an AFFORDABLE solution.

All we need is funding. 
To give you an example of the standard cost of the ""most-advanced"" UVC purification technology, California recently finished building a $72 million water purification plant that utilizes out-dated UVC technology and power intensive osmosis membranes. We can purify the same amount of water, to a higher quality for a FRACTION of their cost. 

The Price Breakdown: You may be wondering, ""Why so much $$$????""

We understand the value of the technology and answers we just gave to the world just by launching this campaign.  
We have changed our campaign. The money no longer matters at this point. We are trying to save as many lives as possible with whatever resources we can accumulate. This means making as many blood purification systems as possible. 
What if we do not get the full funding???
Either way, we will be proceeding with our goal to provide the world with the purest water ever available, whatever that takes.
We have been working closely with our manufacturer, DCR Fabrication, inc. (http://dcrfabinc.com/) Our blue prints are ready. All our components have been waiting in the wings. All the materials are ready to be shipped and assembled, with our team of physicists and engineers excited and ready to give the world this new solution.  
This is where YOU come in. 

We need help. The faster this solution becomes available, the sooner this water quality upgrade will happen and safe, sustainable water WILL be available worldwide.
Utilizing this approach, we can inexpensively deliver pure water to every person and every industry. 
With this inexpensive approach and advanced understanding of our most valuable resource, we are Globally Uniting Lives in Prosperity. 
With pure, sustainable, inexpensive water, everyone wins.
Please spread the word! Every little bit counts. 



For your donations, we will send you awesome perks!

<a name=""english"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hi, and welcome to my Indiegogo page.<br/><br/></a></b>My name is Benjamin Baltruschat. I'm 33 years old and live in Berlin.
<br/><br/>When I was 21, I broke my fifth cervical vertebra in a sports accident; since then I have had
incomplete paraplegia and have been in a wheelchair.
<br/><br/><b>But I want to change that!
</b><br/><br/>I've already achieved a lot since the accident. I found a flat of my own, learned to drive, successfully
qualified as a media designer and then found a job. At the same time, I trained as much as I could and
regained a great deal of mobility.
<br/><br/>Unfortunately, my application for rehabilitation at a centre in Pforzheim was turned down by my
pension fund, on the grounds that it didn't have an agreement with this facility. I was told that I could
only undergo rehabilitation at a clinic with which the pension fund had a contract. However, the
therapy provided there is only to maintain and stabilise my current condition. To bring about a
significant change in my condition, I need a much more intensive and targeted therapy, of the kind
offered in Pforzheim.
<br/><br/>I tried a lot of options and visited a lot of physiotherapists before I came across a reference to the
""Centre for Rehabilitation"" in Pforzheim in a specialist journal. Most of the patients there can, through
intensive therapy, regain the ability to walk.<br/><br/> I realise that might sound like miracle healing, but it's not. Judge for yourself.
<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.zentrum-der-rehabilitation.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Centre for Rehabilitation</a><br/><br/>The therapy is time-intensive and costly, as it involves 6-8 hours of physiotherapy every day. In my
specific case, at least two therapists would be needed to mobilise me. The cost of 30 days of treatment
by two therapists, including accommodation in an apartment, is 22,048 euros.<br/><b><br/>To achieve anything, I need to train at the rehabilitation centre for at least 90 days.
<br/><br/>This therapy will therefore cost me a minimum of 66,144 euros!<br/><br/>Every extra day I can spend there means I can come closer to my goal of being able to walk
again.
</b><br/><br/>To learn to walk again, I need to ""walk"". It requires a lot of intensive exercises. That is why the
treatment is so expensive. The usual hourly rate for a physiotherapist for Bobath treatment is around
58 euros. The physiotherapists in Pforzheim receive an hourly rate of 60 euros, so their pay falls
within the normal range. It's the intensity of the treatment which makes the difference.
<br/><br/>However, the chances of success are promising! I've had a trial appointment at Pforzheim, and I'm
now convinced that at some point I will be able to walk again. I don't know what it will be like. But
the experience of taking a few steps during the trial appointment was both impressive and emotional.
And it strengthened my determination to keep going and to make my dream come true.
<br/><br/>That is why I need all the support I can get!

""Centre for Rehabilitation"" in Pforzheim in a specialist journal. Most of the patients there can, through
intensive therapy, regain the ability to walk. I realise that might sound like miracle healing, but it's not. Judge for yourself.
Centre for RehabilitationThe therapy is time-intensive and costly, as it involves 6-8 hours of physiotherapy every day. In my
specific case, at least two therapists would be needed to mobilise me. The cost of 30 days of treatment
by two therapists, including accommodation in an apartment, is 22,048 euros.To achieve anything, I need to train at the rehabilitation centre for at least 90 days.
This therapy will therefore cost me a minimum of 66,144 euros!Every extra day I can spend there means I can come closer to my goal of being able to walk
again.
To learn to walk again, I need to ""walk"". It requires a lot of intensive exercises. That is why the
treatment is so expensive. The usual hourly rate for a physiotherapist for Bobath treatment is around
58 euros. The physiotherapists in Pforzheim receive an hourly rate of 60 euros, so their pay falls
within the normal range. It's the intensity of the treatment which makes the difference.
However, the chances of success are promising! I've had a trial appointment at Pforzheim, and I'm
now convinced that at some point I will be able to walk again. I don't know what it will be like. But
the experience of taking a few steps during the trial appointment was both impressive and emotional.
And it strengthened my determination to keep going and to make my dream come true.
That is why I need all the support I can get!

<h2>The Challenge: Making Kegel Exercise worth It</h2>
<p>Pelvic floor fitness is so hot right now. From solid metal Ben Wa balls (made famous by ""Fifty Shades of Grey"") to squeezable shapes with luxe price tags, kegel exercisers promise stronger vaginas, sexier sex, and all kinds of health benefits. But let's face it: this ""sit-and-squeeze"" technique is boring, and how do we know it's working? Are we even doing it right?</p>
<h2>The Solution: An Affordable High-Tech Kegel Exerciser with Trackable Results</h2>
<p>LOOP is not a sex toy - it's a complete fitness system that provides real-time results you can see and feel. LOOP's built-in training programs are based on the principle of contracting and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles (also known as kegels) to build strength, much like lifting weights at the gym: complete a certain number of repetitions for a certain amount of time to build strength and tone muscle. LOOP acts as your personal (and private) trainer and motivates you to make kegels a regular part of your daily routine.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/947614/files/20141021041824-loop-palm.jpg?1413890304"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>The Benefits of Pelvic Floor Exercise</h2>
<p>
  Regular kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles and improve blood circulation in the pelvic area. This can enable stronger muscle contractions during orgasms, as well as increase your ability to react to sexual stimulus. Research has shown that pelvic floor muscle exercises helps prevent or diminish stress incontinence. Doing them can also help you prepare your body for childbirth and recover from it.
</p>
<h2>How Does LOOP Work?</h2>
<p>LOOP connects to your Bluetooth-enabled mobile device via a free app that offers pre-programmed exercise routines and visual feedback you can see with every squeeze. LOOP's high-accuracy pressure sensors detect even the slightest muscle movements and translate them onto your screen into easy-to-read graphics with weekly progress reports that prove it's working!</p>

<h3>Uplifting Experience</h3>
<p>The 3-axis accelerometer inside LOOP detects even the slightest motions. It gives you feedback on whether you are ""lifting"" LOOP with your pelvic floor muscles or not. It's important to differentiate between lifting (correct) and pushing (incorrect) in order to make sure you benefit from the exercise.</p>
<h3>Motivational Movement</h3>

<h3>Instant Exercise</h3>
<p>LOOP automatically turns on when you pick it up and connects wirelessly to your phone, which means it's always ready when you are! It's powered by a simple coin cell battery that lasts for up to 1 year, and when it's low on power, the app will tell you it's time to replace it.

<h2>About the Pelvic Floor</h2>
<p>The pelvic floor forms the base of the group of muscles commonly called the ""core"".  It is a series of muscles that are tightly slung between the tailbone (coccyx) and the pubic bone and support healthy bowel, bladder, uterus and vaginal function. Squeeze and hold as though you're trying not to pee - that's your pelvic floor working!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/996828/files/20141108110520-pelvic_floor_muscles.jpg?1415473520"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why Do I Need to Exercise My Pelvic Floor Muscles?</h3>
<p>A strong pelvic floor is able to contract, lift and hold in order to do it's job. Strong pelvic floor muscles can also promote deeper, more powerful orgasms and a noticeable feeling of ""tightness"" during sex. When these muscles become weak, you might experience one or more of the following concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accidentally leaking urine when you laugh, cough or sneeze</li>
<li>Accidental flatulence</li>
<li>Difficulty emptying your bladder or bowels</li>
<li>Lower back or pelvic pain</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Can Cause Pelvic Floor Weakness?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pregnancy and vaginal childbirth</li>
<li>Heavy lifting</li>
<li>Aging/growing older</li>
<li>Being overweight</li>
<li>Chronic constipation or straining to empty the bowels</li>
<li>Chronic coughing or sneezing</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Led To LOOP?</h2>
<p>Doctors, nurses and therapists around the world have been studying pelvic floor health for decades, experimenting with and exploring new ways to combat and alleviate pelvic floor problems. Now, national health organizations in most countries recommend that women exercise their pelvic floor muscles every day to maintain optimal intimate health - yet still, so many women don't do it. With this awareness, we wanted to create a kegel exerciser unlike anything else on the market that would make it fun, easy and exciting to keep the pelvic floor in tip-top shape.</p>
<h2>Why Us? The Team Behind LOOP</h2>
<p>We have worked in the intimate health research and manufacturing fields for years and designed award winning products. Inspired by personal experience, we combined our unique expertise to create this groundbreaking device.</p>

<p>
  Anders and Adam develop hardware and software for fitness electronics and applications that measure and track physical activities with precision and accuracy. Researching how to apply this kind of technology to men's and women's overall health, the two came across medical sensors commonly used in physical therapy offices - but too complicated for the average person to use. They got to work to create a user-friendly version of this important device that could be used for pelvic floor exercise and ultimately improve women's quality of life. The result is the unique technology used in LOOP.
</p>
<h2>Be Part of Bringing LOOP To Women Around the World!</h2>
<p>We have fully functional samples of LOOP that have been tested and reviewed by a wide range of users, and the final design is ready for production. However, we are a small company with limited capacity and can only finance production of a modest number of units.</p>
<p>
  With your pledge, we can increase our production numbers and speed up the process to put LOOP in the hands of women around the world. By introducing LOOP to the marketplace, its ease of use and reasonable price will inspire more women to make kegel exercise part of their daily routine. Every contribution will help to turn our passion for promoting intimate health into exciting reality and introduce superior (and fun!) kegel fitness to women of all ages and lifestyles.

About the Pelvic Floor
The pelvic floor forms the base of the group of muscles commonly called the ""core"".  It is a series of muscles that are tightly slung between the tailbone (coccyx) and the pubic bone and support healthy bowel, bladder, uterus and vaginal function. Squeeze and hold as though you're trying not to pee - that's your pelvic floor working!

Why Do I Need to Exercise My Pelvic Floor Muscles?
A strong pelvic floor is able to contract, lift and hold in order to do it's job. Strong pelvic floor muscles can also promote deeper, more powerful orgasms and a noticeable feeling of ""tightness"" during sex. When these muscles become weak, you might experience one or more of the following concerns:

Accidentally leaking urine when you laugh, cough or sneeze
Accidental flatulence
Difficulty emptying your bladder or bowels
Lower back or pelvic pain

What Can Cause Pelvic Floor Weakness?

Pregnancy and vaginal childbirth
Heavy lifting
Aging/growing older
Being overweight
Chronic constipation or straining to empty the bowels
Chronic coughing or sneezing

What Led To LOOP?
Doctors, nurses and therapists around the world have been studying pelvic floor health for decades, experimenting with and exploring new ways to combat and alleviate pelvic floor problems. Now, national health organizations in most countries recommend that women exercise their pelvic floor muscles every day to maintain optimal intimate health - yet still, so many women don't do it. With this awareness, we wanted to create a kegel exerciser unlike anything else on the market that would make it fun, easy and exciting to keep the pelvic floor in tip-top shape.
Why Us? The Team Behind LOOP
We have worked in the intimate health research and manufacturing fields for years and designed award winning products. Inspired by personal experience, we combined our unique expertise to create this groundbreaking device.


Line Andersen & Karianne Rønning Ellekrans

  Line and Karianne develop intimate wellness products for women, specializing in ergonomic and functional design suited for the female body. Over the last few years, the duo has focused their studies and strategy around solutions to common sexual and intimate issues, including pelvic floor weakness, and created a series of body-safe and female-friendly products that provide fantastic benefits. As women in their 30s and 40s, Line and Karianne know firsthand how important it is to make pelvic floor fitness a daily habit and they can't wait to help other women get into their own kegel routines!


Anders Guldahl & Adam Scheuring

  Anders and Adam develop hardware and software for fitness electronics and applications that measure and track physical activities with precision and accuracy. Researching how to apply this kind of technology to men's and women's overall health, the two came across medical sensors commonly used in physical therapy offices - but too complicated for the average person to use. They got to work to create a user-friendly version of this important device that could be used for pelvic floor exercise and ultimately improve women's quality of life. The result is the unique technology used in LOOP.

Be Part of Bringing LOOP To Women Around the World!
We have fully functional samples of LOOP that have been tested and reviewed by a wide range of users, and the final design is ready for production. However, we are a small company with limited capacity and can only finance production of a modest number of units.

  With your pledge, we can increase our production numbers and speed up the process to put LOOP in the hands of women around the world. By introducing LOOP to the marketplace, its ease of use and reasonable price will inspire more women to make kegel exercise part of their daily routine. Every contribution will help to turn our passion for promoting intimate health into exciting reality and introduce superior (and fun!) kegel fitness to women of all ages and lifestyles.



Production Timeline

Risks & Challenges

  We have selected a manufacturer that we previously worked with on several different products. We know what the next steps are for preparing the production and seeing it all through. It is a complex process and we may encounter challenges along the way that need further solving. Should these challenges arise we will communicate it with you via updates here on Indiegogo.

Frequently Asked Questions
1. When will I receive my LOOP?
We will do our utmost to have your LOOP shipping in May 2015 so you receive it in June. We will provide continuous updates about the production schedule after the campaign has finished.
2. Where do you ship to?
We use major courier companies and we will ship to anywhere they deliver.
3. Is shipping included?
Shipping is $10 (worldwide flat rate). Please add this to the amount of your pledge to cover the cost of shipping. Backers are responsible for any VAT or customs duties levied by their own countries.

4. Is there a warranty for LOOP?
Yes, LOOP comes with a one-year replacement warranty.
5. Which phones will work with LOOP?
At launch LOOP will work with iOS and Android phones that support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). So at this time you need an iPhone 4S or newer, iPod Touch 5, iPad 3 or newer, or a modern Android phone with BLE support such as the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5. Please verify with your product provider that your particular device has Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support.

iPhone 4s/5/5c/5s/6/6 Plus
iPod touch 5
iPad 3/4/Air/mini
Samsung Galaxy S4/S5/Note 3/4
Google Nexus 4/5
Android 4.3/4.4/5 devices with BLE

We are focused on providing the best possible experience for mobile applications right now. We will share a full list of compatible devices closer to our release date.
6. What's in the box?
LOOP will arrive beautifully packaged with the following inside:

LOOP sensor
CR2032 coin cell battery
Protective pouch made of 100% organic bamboo fabric
Instruction manual

By the time of launch, the LOOP app will be available in App Store and Google Play.
7. Who can use LOOP?
Generally speaking all women. The exception would be the first weeks after childbirth or if you have a condition that may require specific treatment other than/or prevents you from doing pelvic floor exercise and/or inserting LOOP into your vagina.
8. Will it come in only one colour?
Initially LOOP will come in one colour as shown here on Indiegogo.
9. How do I know when to replace the battery?
The LOOP app will let you know when the battery is almost depleted.
10. Where can I get a replacement battery?
The battery is the most commonly available coin cell battery (CR2032) that costs less than $2. You can buy it in any grocery store, pharmacy, consumer electronics shop or online store such as Amazon - places where you regularly buy batteries.
11. Is the wireless communication safe to use?
The wireless communication is based on Bluetooth LE and is 100% safe. It is a thousand times less powerful than WiFi or the cellular network communication of your phone.
12. How long will I be able to use it?
If used as directed, LOOP should last for many years.
13. Will it help me experience orgasm?
LOOP first and foremost can help you get a stronger pelvic floor. A stronger pelvic floor can enable stronger contractions during orgasms, as well as increase blood flow in your pelvis which again can increase your ability to react to sexual stimulus.
14. Will it help prevent bladder problems?
LOOP is designed to help you exercise your pelvic floor correctly and regularly. If you exercise your pelvic floor muscles regularly and properly, you will strengthen the muscles or maintain their strength. A stronger pelvic floor can increase continence.
15. Will it help with lower back problems?
Lower back problems may have various causes. Exercising your pelvic floor, with or without LOOP may not have any impact on lower back problems. But when lower back problems are a result of a weak pelvic floor, certainly strengthening the pelvic floor muscles could have a positive impact.
16. What is it made of?
LOOP's surface is made of body-safe silicone which means it is phthalate-free, non-porous and hypo allergenic.
17. How do I clean it?
LOOP is 100% watertight so it is easy to clean, simply use warm water and regular soap.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

Shadowvest seeks to become the first mobile and concealable exercise device for consumers, personal trainers and physical therapists who are looking to improve the quality of their lives as well as the lives of their patients/clients.

ShadowVest was designed by Brian Sniffen. Brian possesses a Master's degree in Biology, two NASM certifications in exercise physiology: a personal training and mixed martial arts conditioning and a certification in FMS (functional movement system, which was designed by renowned physical therapist Gray Cooke and Dr. Lee Burton).   What We Need:
Currently, 10,000 dollars of contribution money is required to begin the initial marketing phase.
The contributions made will go to:
 Creating awareness for this product, so people can possess an alternative option to staying healthy. Examples: social media outlets, outdoor events, fitness trade shows, etc. An infomercial demonstrating the benefits will also help in conveying the message.
Educating physical therapists and personal trainers on how this product can be used in conjunction with normal and rehabilitative exercises. Just like creating awareness there are outdoor events such as marathons, 5k and 10k events, walk for breast cancer, etc, which would be nice venues to demonstrate and educate.
Creating further embellishments to this product as needed to better serve a wide range of individual needs. Example: proper fitting for size differences, bands with better adjustability to progress individuals.
  The Impact

<p>Do you have any friends who run or lift every day but complain when they miss a day? They simply have developed the habit of exercise. For them, it actually requires willpower to NOT work out. </p>
<p>With two months of daily activity, you’d feel exactly the same. This might sound crazy, but it’s been scientifically validated. </p>

<p>Pavlok Fit uses a powerful commitment ecosystem to help your form this habit. Choose between hitting the gym (measured by GPS), walking 10,000 steps, or running with Runkeeper. Earn rewards when you succeed to keep you motivated.</p>
<p>Choose your commitment level, and when you succeed, you’ll earn money. But, if you fail, you’ll have a penalty to your Facebook friends. Either you’ll give them your money --- or they’ll get to <b>shock you</b>.</p>

</div><div>
<p>Hi! I'm Maneesh Sethi. A few years ago, I  hired a girl to <a href=""http://hackthesystem.com/blog/why-i-hired-a-girl-on-craigslist-to-slap-me-in-the-face-and-why-it-quadrupled-my-productivity/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">slap me in the face whenever I used  Facebook</a>. My productivity increased 4x --- so I knew I was on to something.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, I asked my friend <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kaminsky"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dan Kaminsky</a> if we could build a shock collar that shocked me when I went on Facebook. Dan said: Let's go to RadioShack.</p>
<p>So we built a prototype, and I was fortunate that an incubator in Boston, <a href=""http://bolt.io/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bolt</a>, decided to invest. They then introduced me to my co-founder, Jim Lynch --- the original inventor of LEGO Mindstorms and the senior engineer on the Roomba Floor Cleaning Robot.</p>
<p>Below, you can see the change in size --- from November 2010, all the way to our smallest quartersize module.</p>

<p>Beeping, vibrating, monetary penalties, and posting on your social network like Facebook. You choose what method motivates you the most. </p>
<p><b>Do you offer a warranty?</b></p>
<p>Yes, Pavlok is has a one-year manufacturer warranty!</p>
<p><b>How long does the battery last?</b></p>
<p>Pavlok can deliver up to 200 shocks on a single charge. That means that for the typical user Pavlok will last 4 days on a full charge. </p>
<p><b>What stops you from taking it off?</b></p>
<p>Pavlok knows when it's on you --- the human detect is an important component. If you're late to the gym, you get vibrated and shocked. But if you've made a real commitment, and you're not wearing the wristband --- you get charged money. Real commitment comes from real accountability.</p>
<p><b>Are there different size wristbands?</b></p>
<p>The wristband is adjustable, so it will fit you for sure :).</p>
<p><b>How do you control how much it shocks you?</b></p>
<p>You can adjust the intensity of the shock inside the app.</p>
<p><b>How do you charge it?</b></p>

<p>Very snug to the skin to maintain constant contact to your skin.</p>
<p><b>Is it waterproof?</b></p>
<p>You can't swim in it, but we are working on making it highly water resistant.</p>
<p><b>What habits can I break with Pavlok?</b></p>
<p>Pavlok is designed to help to break ANY habit. This ranges from visiting distracting websites, going to fast food restaurants, not standing up from your desk often enough, going to bed late, biting your nails, and TONS of others. </p>
<p><b>Do I have to wear Pavlok everyday in order to reap the benefits?</b></p>
<p>No! Research has shown that it can take as little as 30 days to break a habit. While some stubbornly ingrained habits can take up to 66 days, habits like flossing or going to bed on time can be achieved in less than 2 weeks! After you've formed a habit with Pavlok you no longer need to wear it everyday, unless you have a different habit that you are trying to make or break. And if you ever start to fall off track with one of your habits all you have to do is put Pavlok back on for a few days to correct yourself!</p>
<p><b>Are you guys the most awesome company ever?</b></p>
<p>Well it's very nice of you to ask :) We pride ourselves on our ability to give our supporters a truly unique device unlike anything they've ever had before and to give them the means to become the person they always knew they could become.

HOW PAVLOK HELPS


Pavlok adds accountability and electric shock to change what you do.
It is the first device that helps you form good habits, break bad habits, and stick to your commitments, using any means necessary. 

Pavlok starts with punishment for bad behavior, and moves to positive feedback for good behavior over time.




THE EXPERTS LOVE PAVLOK

Don't take our word for it, check out what the experts are saying.

HOW PAVLOK WORKS
By combining positive and negative reinforcement.

Pavlok combines accurate tracking, commitment techniques, and 'on-your-wrist' reminder triggers to change users' brains and form the habits they wish they had.








Pavlok is easy to get started.









Choose your daily habit
Pick your action. Exercise every day, be more productive online, learn a new language, wake up earlier — the possibilities are endless!



In the Pavlok app, choose what you want to accomplish. Pavlok will break your goal down into easy, manageable actions. Each day, Pavlok will push you to stay on track and form the lasting habit.



Real Accountability, Real Results
Willpower isn't enough. Habit change requires accountability. You won't have to make the journey alone - Pavlok helps you find a partner or join a team of your friends.



Social support and pressure will keep you on track. When you hit a bump in the road, they'll motivate you to keep going. Or, they'll punish you.




Earn Rewards and Face Penalties

Choose your level of commitment. Pavlok can reward you when you achieve your goals. Earn prizes and even money when you complete your daily task.



But be warned: if you fail, you’ll face penalties. Pay a fine, lose access to your phone, or even suffer an electric shock…at the hands of your friends.


Make a change that lasts.
Research shows that consistency is the key to forming a habit. When you use Pavlok to stick to your goals, you'll find that they become easier and eventually, automatic.


At that point, use Pavlok to train your next habit and keep up your transformation into a better you.



PAVLOK CHANGES HABITS
You can use Pavlok to change all sorts of behaviors.

Form new habits





Wake up early
What would you do with just one extra hour of time each day? Would you start a business, explore your creativity, or just have some “me” time? The opportunities are endless. But it’s so easy to hit “snooze” and roll over.


Pavlok: Wake Up lets you set an alarm to gently vibrate and wake you up. But, what if you keep hitting the snooze button? Pavlok can deliver just enough of a “jolt” to get you up and running --- with adrenaline.


Get In Shape, Stay In Shape
Do you have any friends who run or lift every day but complain when they miss a day? They simply have developed the habit of exercise. For them, it actually requires willpower to NOT work out. 
With two months of daily activity, you’d feel exactly the same. This might sound crazy, but it’s been scientifically validated. 


Pavlok Fit uses a powerful commitment ecosystem to help your form this habit. Choose between hitting the gym (measured by GPS), walking 10,000 steps, or running with Runkeeper. Earn rewards when you succeed to keep you motivated.
Choose your commitment level, and when you succeed, you’ll earn money. But, if you fail, you’ll have a penalty to your Facebook friends. Either you’ll give them your money --- or they’ll get to shock you.



Break bad habits




Conquer Distractions, Be More Productive

Pavlok Productive retrains your deeply ingrained “chronic web surfing” habits. In our trial research, we found that a large number of participants have significant trouble getting work done in the face of temptation (e.g. incoming emails, interesting articles, status updates).
The Pavlok app and wristband track your surfing habits. Using a combination of vibration, sound, and electric shock, the wristband stops distractions in their tracks and keeps you focused on your work.
How much would you get done if you stopped wasting time on social media and constantly checking your email? Pavlok can break the bad habit of opening too many tabs and mindlessly wasting your day.

EXPAND PAVLOK WITH IFTT

Different people want to change different behaviors.


We plan to integrate with ifttt.com, a website that connects different products with different APIs.  



Here are examples of some potential integration's.



Shock you when you text your ex-lover.


Remind you to take your medicine, and connect to a smart Pill bottle to prove compliance


Beep loudly any time you step inside of a McDonald's.


Improve your golf swing or powerlifting technique using other wearable sensors and our scalable vibration motor.


Help you meditate by having you commit to a training app.


Integrate with smart EEG brain devices to train and get feedback on your mental states.


Use Pavlok to remind you to eat more protein or walk more steps.


Ensure that you get up from your computer every hour to stretch.

Train and remind you not to go on distracting websites in real-time.

Justine D.

Habit: Wake Up An Hour Earlier
Now I get up at 7 without pressing the snooze button, do 10 mins of mindfulness meditation, read a few pages of a philosophical or poetry book, and write. These are all habits now!



Daniel D.
Habit: Write 1000 words each day
I’ve been able to write 1,000 words per day consistently. No matter how hard I've tried in the past, it was impossible. But the program really works. The best part is, now the habit doesn't feel like a chore...it's just part of my life.




PAVLOK WORKS YOUR CURRENT APPSWork seamlessly with apps that you are already using.Don't worry about tracking everything separately, we'll do the hard part for you. 

All you have to do is decide what habit you want to tackle and we'll make sure that you achieve your goals! (Thanks to Beeminder for helping us)





THE STORY BEHIND PAVLOK

Hi! I'm Maneesh Sethi. A few years ago, I  hired a girl to slap me in the face whenever I used  Facebook. My productivity increased 4x --- so I knew I was on to something.
A few weeks later, I asked my friend Dan Kaminsky if we could build a shock collar that shocked me when I went on Facebook. Dan said: Let's go to RadioShack.
So we built a prototype, and I was fortunate that an incubator in Boston, Bolt, decided to invest. They then introduced me to my co-founder, Jim Lynch --- the original inventor of LEGO Mindstorms and the senior engineer on the Roomba Floor Cleaning Robot.
Below, you can see the change in size --- from November 2010, all the way to our smallest quartersize module.





Timeline
October: Make lots of friends on IndieGoGo.
November: Finalize the engineering of Pavlok and place the tooling orders.
December: Build-out tooling and procure raw materials and components.
January: Ramp up mass manufacturing, pilot the production process, and perform quality assurance on product.
February: Begin mass manfacturing for our Pavlok community.
March: Complete the assembly and prepare for shipment.
April: BEGIN SHIPPING!!!! HOORAY!!!

<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary
The Gentle Healing Place Radio show has aired on Blogtalk radio for approximately 2 years with 75,000 listeners. We wish to graduate to a larger venue Contact Talk Radio Network which has a million listeners. Donations will pay for the 1st year we are on the air with this station.


What We Need & What You Get
Air time costs $350.00 a month and we will have a 1 hour show once a week and be able to spread our message of love, joy, and compassion.We are dedicate... d to facilitating personal growth, awareness and spirituality in the gentle way. We have a unique format with 3 psychics that do live readings .


The Impact
Your donations will go to pay the air time needed to broadcast our show on Contact Talk Radio Network. Every $350 recieved will pay for one month or 4 shows. We will be able to reach an international audience both on the internet as well as on the radio dial. CTR has over a million listeners.  We hope  to provide a safe place for people to come to discuss in forum fashion, non- traditional ways that lead to enlightenment and holistic health in a loving and positive way. Some topics may include psychic development,dreams,artistic endeavors,paranormal events and all things spiritual. The intention is to promote love in a real and practical way.Free readings are available on most shows from the Psychic Trio and Special Guests. It is our belief that the planet can be healed one person at a time by raising the potential and purpose of individuals to replace, power, profit, prestige to love, joy, and compassion for humanity. With purity of intention, anything is possible and we are open to recieving the gifts and blessings that the Universe intends for this vision.

<h3>Help our troops with back pain</h3>
<p>My name is Paul Hagen, I'm the co-founder of <a href=""http://www.vacupractor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""VacuPractor.com"">VacuPractor</a>, a Veteran owned small business (VOSB) with all the manufacturing done here in the U.S. For the last 3 years I have had a 95% success rate helping people with back pain feel better one back at a time.</p>
<p>With the military, these men and women need to be ""Fit to Fight"" and drug free. We currently have 3 military doctors using the VacuPractor with great success and we just completed a 6 week field test with the Army.</p>
<p>As a Sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corp from from 1987 to 1992 I had the honor of serving my Country at the U.S. Embassy, La Paz, Bolivia, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, and the U.S. Embassy, Paris, France. </p>
<p>After my back stopped hurting, helping others with lower back pain became my calling.  It took us 5 years to get the patent, 1 year for FDA registration, and we have all the certifications and approvals to sell to the Government including our own Cage code.  We recently started making a few P-card sales too. </p>
<p>Getting the VacuPractor into the hands of troops that are in pain, out in the field and those returning home is my latest mission.  There are too many, just popping pills. That is masking, not fixing the problem.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 20px;"">If you click <a href=""http://www.vacupractor.com/gov/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this link</a> it will open a new window and you can see our Military and Government information page along with our downloadble <a href=""http://bit.ly/vacupractor-capa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Capability Statement</a>.  </p>
<p>We are a small company, that is competing against the giant corporations with $50 million dollar ad budgets for each new pill.  Please help us compete against Big Pharma, and support a 100% Made In America Company. </p>
<h3><strong>How our simple invention works:</strong></h3>
<p>VacuPractor is a revolutionary patented device registered with the FDA for the self-treatment of lower back pain. The user lies on the device, creating a natural vacuum effect to gently pull the spine and stretch the muscles in the lower back area. Pain is relieved in as little as five to ten minutes of use. <strong>VacuPractor is a drug free solution</strong> and can be used on any flat firm surface with just a little water and it can be combined with other pain treatments as part of a patient’s total care.</p>

</div></div>","Jayden's story
Jayden was diagnosed with Childhood rhabdomyosarcoma, Rhabdomyosarcoma is usually curable in most children with localized disease who receive combined-modality therapy, with more than 70% surviving with proper treatment. Shelby, Jayden's mommy is 21 and devotes her life to Jayden and is confident that together they'll beat this. Jaydens chemo has yielded unsuccessful reulsts, he needs to travel back and fourth to Florida for radiation treatment. Jayden hasn't celebrated this first birthday yet.
Jayden needs money for travel and lodging. 


$10,000 is really not a lot of money when you're talking about a child's life and happiness. Jayden will need to make repeated trips from North Carolina to Jacksonville for his radiation treatments, mom will not be able to do this without your help. Help make a difference in in child's life who hasnt had the chance to really live yet. ALL money will go to Shelby and Jayden for his care and expenses regardless of goal completion. 
 
 


The Impact
Shelby is my niece, she has asked for prayers, I don't pray, I act. This is the best way I can see to help an amazing young women and her beautiful son.

It stimulates blood glucose (to fuel your muscles), pupil dilation (to see tigers better), slows digestion/peristalsis (to focus energy on the present danger), and <strong>increases heart rate </strong>(to ensure adequate blood circulation to run or fight). The SNS is ideally activated to overcome short term stress situations such as running from a tiger or fighting an intruder.

To learn more about using the power of HRV, read on to our ""Science of HRV"" section. We designed CorSense from the ground up to capture accurate HRV, so the benefits of HRV would be more accessible and convenient.Unfortunately many wrist wearables and smartwatches are not good at tracking accurate HRV. By contrast, CorSense is comparable in accuracy to a 5-lead EKG/ECG for HRV and pulse waveform, using multiple different LEDs, onboard algorithms and filters, fast sampling rates and physiologically optimized sensors. We also designed CorSense to be a completely open platform. This means:1) Raw data collected by CorSense is available for export/download; and2) CorSense works with any open HRV app that offers Bluetooth connectivity - right out of the box.However, for the full experience, we recommend using CorSense with the Elite HRV app. With over 150,000 users from around the world, our app has been rated 4.5/5 stars on both Android and Apple.Our users are health-seekers, doctors, wellness practitioners, coaches, athletes, sports teams, and researchers. Here's an uncut demo of Jason taking his Morning Readiness HRV reading with the CorSense and the Elite HRV app.

But this same response also occurs when you exercise, perform challenging mental tasks, get into an argument, or even launch a new product :). The Parasympathetic Nervous System controls your body’s “rest and digest” responses and is associated with recovery. Parasympathetic activation conserves energy, constricts pupils, aids digestion, and slows heart rate. The PSNS is meant to help build for the long term and is needed to grow faster, stronger, and healthier. The SNS and PSNS control the same organs with opposite effects. Both branches are always working and both are needed to maintain homeostasis (balance or equilibrium) in your body. With every single heartbeat, your nervous system is saying “slow down – speed up” based on feedback from all your senses, emotions, etc. A healthy nervous system has a balanced but strong push and pull between the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic branches. Heart Rate Variability is an accurate, non-invasive measure of the ANS and the balance between the SNS and PSNS branches.The Sympathetic Nervous System’s physiological response to stress focuses on short term survival in lieu of long term health. This acute response can become chronic (constant, long term) in the presence of stress from modern daily life such as work, relationships, financial, environmental, dietary, physical, lifestyle choices, etc. Chronically accumulated stress from multiple sources can all contribute to drastically reduced health and performance over the long term. A significant amount of research published over the past 50 years correlates Heart Rate Variability to: 
Disease risk and progression (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, autoimmune conditions, etc.) 
Morbidity and mortality
Biological aging and health 
Mental health, mood, depression, anxiety, PTSD
Physical performance (HRV is heavily used in elite endurance and team sports to guide training and recovery)
Injury prevention
Guided rehabilitation
Mental cognition
Now that you can accurately and conveniently track your nervous system, you can make better health, training, and recovery decisions to reach your goals. Higher resting-state HRV scores signify the ability of the body to activate the Parasympathetic “rest-and-digest” response. Higher heart rate variability is correlated with: 
Increased fitness level 
Better health 
Better resilience 
Youthfulness 
Willpower 
Calm, positive emotions
Lower resting-state HRV scores signify an activated Sympathetic “fight-or-flight” response or suppressed Parasympathetic activity. This can indicate the body’s inability to engage recovery mode or an exhaustion of recovery capacity. This can be a temporary response to a previous day’s hard workout or poor night of sleep. Or this can be a chronic response to stress that results in reduced health and increased risk of disease. Lower resting-state HRV is tied to: 
Reduced fitness level 
Poor health
Increased disease risk and inflammation 
Increased biological age 
Negative emotions 
Increased anxiety and depression
Luckily, we make analyzing and understanding your HRV score easy. The app lets you tag your HRV measurements with the important things going on in your life and then helps you analysis the results and provides daily HRV-based guidance. We are a small group that decided to leave our day-jobs and come together to make a difference. We are not a big company, but we are passionate about helping people reach their health and performance goals. We believe that heart rate variability is one of the most powerful tools available to achieve this. We value transparency and collaboration because everyone is smarter and better when honestly working together.  A special thank-you to our collaborators!",39.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is Mandy, and I'm hoping to raise at least 100 dollars by July 28th so I can go to summer camp! Any extra funds I recieve will go towards gas and lodging to drive there and camp next year!</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I do not need the full 500, though it'd be nice. Indiegogo's minimum is 500, that's why I set it. I only need 100 to be able to make it to camp.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
NBTSC was the greatest and most wonderful experience of my life. It means the world to me that I get to go again, and see my friends again. I would be ever so grateful if you can help. Even 1 dollar helps. :)</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Hello, my name is Lindsey and I am a high schooler in Bellevue Washington. This project is important to me because I love helping others, and I also love passing the good spirit on.</h3>
<h3>My ultimate goal is $2,000 and that will provide a water source at a school in a 3rd world country. $1,000 will provide a share of a water source, but will not achive all of it. All money will be given to Save the Children, and extra money will be used to purchase things like goats and mosquito nets for familys.  The more money you give, the better the reward is. $30 gets you my family Sugar Cookie recipe, and $60 gets you the Sugar Cookie recipe and should-be-world-famous No-Bake Cookies. $100, the best, is rewarded with both of those, and a Chocolate Cupcake recipe!</h3>
<h3>The higher your contribution, the better the world is! More money makes more people happy and thankfull. If this project succeeds, I will do it again, except next time I will be raising money for educating girls all over the world.  But lets focus on what's important now, like raising money for clean water at schools. A major thing is that providing the water source makes sure no one near or in the school will ever get dehydratred, which makes it easier to function and learn!</h3>
<h3>Maybe you can't contribute. That doesn't  matter! You can still help! Tell your friends! Tell your co-workers! Tell everyone you know aboout this wonderful cause!</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>See those girls in the profile pic, that's me on the left. My name is Rachel Robocker. I grew in in Maryville, TN. Now I live in Northwest Arkansas as a Graphic Designer with my husband and our baby boy.</p>
<p>Growing up, I didn't have many close friends. And of those close friends, most of them are gone and we have parted ways. When I was 6 years old, I was a skinny, blonde haired, innocent &amp; quiet little girl. Afraid of most everyone and didn't want to do anything to get in trouble or be disliked. Too timid for my own good. But in first grade, I met someone who would change my life. She taught me to be strong, brave, and respect &amp; love who I am. She showed me that sometimes you need to break a rule or two. She was with me through every hard thing I've ever dealt with in my life. She knows me probably better than I know myself.</p>
<p>Her name is Danielle Hubbard (she's the girl on the right in the picture). A strawberry blonde haired, freckled face little girl with a loud mouth and a lot of attitude. She wasn't afraid of anything or anyone. If she had something to say, she'd let you know. And she's my best friend still today (although the freckles have faded and her strawberry blonde is just blonde.)</p>
<p>It is honestly amazing we made it through our childhood without killing one another. Not from fighting. She's one person I rarely fought with. No, we were rough &amp; stupid kids. The first summer together, we discovered what electric fences are the hard way (I don't recommend it to anyone), along with finding out what falling off your bike at full speed and landing like Charlie Brown feels like...I don't recommend that either.</p>
<p>We've been so tangled in brair patches we had to be cut out, rolled her go-kart multiple occasions, ran her Papaw's lawn mower into a barb wire fence (yea, it was destroyed) and lost in the Smoky Mountains back roads once we learned how to drive...and those are only a few of the things we'll admit too. Too sum it up, we've done a lot and hardly been hurt in our 24 years of age. Until last fall.</p>
<p>Danielle was told she had melanoma. Her first doctor didn't treat it as aggresivelly as he should, which we discovered in mid-March 2012 when she was told she has Kidney Cancer.</p>
<p>On June 1st, Danielle thought she may be having a heart attack. She drove herself to the ER (yes. HERSELF) at Blount Memorial in Maryville, TN. They told her it wasn't a heart attack. She had an aneurysm on her heart. Before she even had a chance to call her husband or father, they had her drugged and in an ambulance for UT Medical Center. (If you google map it, that's supposed to be a 21 minute drive...they did it in about 10). </p>
<p>Danielle was in surgery for a very long time. Her surgery was a success and saved her life, but it wasn't an aneurysm like they had thought. It was a tumor. Her Kidney Cancer had moved to her blood stream and into her heart.</p>
<p>I received this news a couple days after she was home from the hospital (June 7th). I immediately left for TN to see her. I spent the weekend with her. Her arms look like a junkies from all the needles they had in her. Her chest has a 6 inch scar (healing nicely tho) and a few more scars from various needles and such. She was in good spirits, only complaining about her chest hurting. She said she didn't feel sick. She couldn't believe the cancer was real.</p>
<p>When I went back to AR for work on monday (June 11th), she called me. Her doctors had told her they gave her a 5% survival rate. We were shocked.</p>
<p>The doctors told her to go down to Tampa, FL. That they have an experimental treatment they can do. Her mother, her husband, her 3-year old daughter and herself packed up and flew down June 22nd, the earliest they could. It cost them $2100, not including the hotel, food, or rental car.</p>
<p>Monday, June 25th, the doctors at the Moffitt Cancer Center, told her there was nothing they could do. They had flown in for nothing.</p>
<p>June 26th, Tuesday, Danielle told me her urine wasn't right. She had called her doctor in TN. They said her kidneys may be failing. She flies up to TN Wednesday, June27th, for tests. If her kidneys are failing, they will keep in the hospital. If not, she flies back to Florida on Thursday to prepare for her wedding. She is planning on renewing her vows in Florida with her husband on July 8th. I am flying down the 6th to be with her on her 2nd wedding day. </p>
<p>This is the only news we know so far. The chances of survival for Danielle are not good and things are getting worse. She needs some good news. And I want to help give that to her. If you could please help with the travel expense for her family and herself, I know it would mean the world to her! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Any funs raised will go directly to Danielle's family for travel expense to hospitals. This includes plane tickets, possible hotel costs or rental car coverage.</p>
<p>When the goal is reached, I will tell Danielle about this donation site. I want this to be a surprise for her. If we don't meet our goal, I will surprise her with the amount we have raised at her wedding. Yes, this will be recorded for you all to see on the youtube channel.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Danielle has received nothing but bad news. While I cannot give her good health news, you can help give her good financial news. Help her cover the cost of one of those round trip flights between hospitals! Help Danielle stay strong and brighten her day a little bit so she dosen't give up!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot donate, please pray for Danielle Hubbard and her family. Spread the word about her situation. Prayer is a powerful thing and I believe the more prayers, the better.</p>

This is the only news we know so far. The chances of survival for Danielle are not good and things are getting worse. She needs some good news. And I want to help give that to her. If you could please help with the travel expense for her family and herself, I know it would mean the world to her! 


What We Need & What You Get
Any funs raised will go directly to Danielle's family for travel expense to hospitals. This includes plane tickets, possible hotel costs or rental car coverage.
When the goal is reached, I will tell Danielle about this donation site. I want this to be a surprise for her. If we don't meet our goal, I will surprise her with the amount we have raised at her wedding. Yes, this will be recorded for you all to see on the youtube channel.


The Impact
Danielle has received nothing but bad news. While I cannot give her good health news, you can help give her good financial news. Help her cover the cost of one of those round trip flights between hospitals! Help Danielle stay strong and brighten her day a little bit so she dosen't give up!


Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot donate, please pray for Danielle Hubbard and her family. Spread the word about her situation. Prayer is a powerful thing and I believe the more prayers, the better.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

on horseback</h3>
</b><p>Many volunteers support Happy Trails Riding Academy so that
more children, Wounded Warriors and adults can experience the life-changing
opportunity that is equine therapy.</p>
<p>Volunteers and staff work with children and adults with
physical, cognitive and emotional disabilities such as cerebral palsy, ADHD,
head trauma, PTSD, autism, Down syndrome and more. They are paired with horses
in a challenging alternative to traditional therapy, which results in healing,
trust, independence and improved communication.</p>
<p>Happy Trails is a PATH International premier accredited
center – a symbol of excellence.</p>
<p><b></b></p><h3><b>Hay! Happy Trails needs a barn!</b></h3><p></p>
<p>Our 18 horses will go through 50 TONS of hay in 2015 and we
have no hay barn. The hay is now being moved daily from a local farm but we
need a hay barn on site large enough to accommodate storage of a lot of hay.</p>
<p>Of course the need doesn’t stop there. We must continually
fund-raise to pay for the care of the horses and the facility and staffing.
Your donation will support all aspects of our mission.</p>
<p></p><h3><b>How does equine therapy work?</b></h3>
<p>We provide therapy to about 80 kids and adults a week,
ranging from 3 to 50+ with the majority under age 18. Equine Assisted Activities
and Therapy uses the horse’s dynamic movement to improve the trunk mobility and
strength, which then affects limb function. The horse provides a consistent and
rhythmic movement pattern that facilitates treatment goals, which is crucial to
the student’s success. The therapist, volunteers, horse and rider form the
therapy team. </p>
<p>Equine Services for Heroes is the newest program. In
conjunction with the Wounded Warrior Project, Happy Trails provides therapeutic
horsemanship to help veterans deal with anything from physical injury to PTSD.
It has been proven to help strengthen them physically, mentally and
emotionally. </p>
<p></p><h3><b>What is Happy Trails Riding Academy?</b></h3>
<p>Our vision is to operate an attractive and quality therapeutic
riding facility on our own property, with outstanding, modern
facilities in a safe, secure and caring environment. We will we have the best
horses possible to meet our program needs and will make sure they are properly
treated and cared for. We are committed to expanding our facilities, if
financial resources are available, to meet our growth needs. Tack and related
equipment will continually be inspected and upgraded to make sure they are safe
as possible for our ridership.</p>

fund-raise to pay for the care of the horses and the facility and staffing.
Your donation will support all aspects of our mission.
How does equine therapy work?
We provide therapy to about 80 kids and adults a week,
ranging from 3 to 50+ with the majority under age 18. Equine Assisted Activities
and Therapy uses the horse’s dynamic movement to improve the trunk mobility and
strength, which then affects limb function. The horse provides a consistent and
rhythmic movement pattern that facilitates treatment goals, which is crucial to
the student’s success. The therapist, volunteers, horse and rider form the
therapy team. 
Equine Services for Heroes is the newest program. In
conjunction with the Wounded Warrior Project, Happy Trails provides therapeutic
horsemanship to help veterans deal with anything from physical injury to PTSD.
It has been proven to help strengthen them physically, mentally and
emotionally. 
What is Happy Trails Riding Academy?
Our vision is to operate an attractive and quality therapeutic
riding facility on our own property, with outstanding, modern
facilities in a safe, secure and caring environment. We will we have the best
horses possible to meet our program needs and will make sure they are properly
treated and cared for. We are committed to expanding our facilities, if
financial resources are available, to meet our growth needs. Tack and related
equipment will continually be inspected and upgraded to make sure they are safe
as possible for our ridership.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

It is a precision optical instrument built with micron-level tolerances. Substantial engineering effort was required in order to build reliable devices on a mass scale. To achieve that, we have employed a team of exceptional industrial designers, mechanical, electrical, optical, and firmware engineers. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542664554/o27grwjqr1jdnfkcn7sz.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>How it works:</strong></p><p>The VisionCheck is based on an MIT patented technology licensed exclusively to EyeQue. This technology has been extensively tested in our 1st generation product, the Personal Vision Tracker and uses a variant of the inverse Shack-Hartmann effect. </p><p>The device projects two parallel beams of light that comes from the smartphone display into your eyes and onto your retina. The beams of light come from red and green lines formed by illuminated pixels on your smartphone, separated by 2.5 mm when they leave the device so that they can fit through your pupil.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542664656/pxdx75psoja8frwbjgkk.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Using an interactive touch-sensitive interface, the user overlaps the two lines to form what looks like one yellow line. Based on the amount of pixel movement made, EyeQue calculates the user's refractive error in that particular direction. The device then rotates the lines to another angle and you repeat the measurement. Measuring the refractive power over a number of different angles gives the sphere, cylinder, and axis needed to correct your vision with eyeglasses. The method works for most people who are willing and able to follow the instructions we provide.</p><p><strong>The science behind the device:</strong></p><p>We cannot explain the science without explaining the human eye first. Nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism occur when the eye lens and eye distance are “out of synch"". Normal distance vision is the result of the light entering the eye and focusing exactly on the retina, where the brain interprets sharp images. Common deviations from normal vision, nearsightedness, or myopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light before your retina; Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light past your retina, both causing the brain to interpret ""blurry"" images. Almost 50% of the human population has some degree of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. These conditions are also known as ""refractive errors"".</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542664672/fknzjicdioc96cflaxgv.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The EyeQue VisionCheck is an optical device that achieves the effect of a variable corrective lens as it translates pixel spacing on the smartphone screen to corrective powers. To simulate the effect of converging or diverging rays into your eye that a correction lens would provide, you simply move the pixels on the screen closer or further emulating the effect of a corrective lens; overlapping the red and green lines and creating a single yellow line. Think of the VisionCheck as a custom converter of pixel spacing to optical power. Using that conversion, VisionCheck can determine corrections from + 8 D to – 10 D.</p><p>VisionCheck uses your smartphone's display to work; with a pixel spacing on the order of .07 mm (70 microns) or better– comparatively, about the diameter of a human hair. VisionCheck works well for phones down to 250 Pixels per inch (PPI). Any PPI below 250 means that the resolution is too low for it to be optometrically accurate.</p><p>The iPhone6s, for example, has an adjacent pixel spacing of 21 microns, and about 63 microns between same color pixels. With this small pixel spacing, VisionCheck exceeds 0.25 Diopter resolution. As a reference,0.25 Diopter accuracy is the level typically achieved by Optometrists.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542664708/albcxfhkhjdnhvgenvkm.png"" src=""""/></p><p>While it is easy to understand how EyeQue can measure the overall optical power for nearsightedness and farsightedness, VisionCheck also gets an accurate measurement of astigmatism by sampling over different angels. To measure astigmatism, a complete set of power measurements is comprised of 9 measurements for your right eye and 9 measurements for your left eye. Measurements are made at increments of 40 degrees and with these measurements, the astigmatism is computed.</p><p>Yes, that’s a lot of measurements but the device is making measurements of tiny differences that reflect the shape of the eye lens and cornea. About 1 diopter of astigmatism, a typical value implies that the non-spherical component of the eye is about 0.25 mm. 0.25mm is thinner than your average ball-point pen point.</p><p>All computations are carried out in the EyeQue cloud as it takes a substantial amount of computation that is dependent on many different parameters including the smartphone you are using. As you take more tests, the results are aggregated together through averaging and removing bad data points. Each test is scored based on the goodness of the computed fit to the measurements. An example of test results is shown below.</p><p>Along with your test results, we also provide you with a measure of the consistency. The plot on the right also shows how other users have performed as shown by the relative size of the blue dots; most but not all users fall into the ""good"" category.

EyeQue VisionCheck is a refractometer that measures your refractive error, i.e. your nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The tests show results in the same format as your prescription, allowing you to order glasses online. The results will also include your estimated near-vision add (NV ADD+), needed to purchase reading or progressive glasses.The VisionCheck includes a patent-pending pupillary distance (PD) measurement tool, called the PDCheck, that accurately captures your PD in a matter of seconds.  We've given over ONE THOUSAND demos of the VisionCheck over the course of 4 days. Check out what people are saying!

 
 EyeQue Provides Award-winning Consumer Technology The EyeQue VisionCheck's development is based on our first product, the EyeQue Personal Vision Tracker, a manual refractometer that launched on Kickstarter and Indiegogo in 2017. Having received over 4500 pledges, our technology was also nominated for the prestigious SPIE Prism award; referred to as the Oscars of the optical industry.Over the past two years, our patented technology has shown unprecedented accuracy and received praises from many of our users. Check out our testimonial section below!CES has honored us with not one, but TWO CES Innovations Awards in 2017 and 2019. Save money: The EyeQue VisionCheck is inexpensive (MSRP $59.99) compared to your typical office visit and can be shared with many persons. All of our products are supported through annual memberships, currently starting at $4.99 per year. Each membership enables unlimited usage of all EyeQue vision-testing products, ranging from $29.99 to $89.99. Save time: Unlike traditional office visits that you make once a year, you can use the EyeQue VisionCheck anywhere, anytime. All you need is a smartphone and an active internet connection. No need to schedule ahead, drive through traffic, and wait at the office only to sit through boring lectures or sales spiels. In comparison, each VisionCheck test takes about 5 minutes to complete once you understand the process. Most first-time users get great results after taking 3 or 4 tests, usually under 30 minutes in total. EyeQue is hassle free and gives back hours of your valuable time.More accurate than a single point-in-time refraction test: Since your vision fluctuates throughout the day, taking multiple tests at different times of the day gives a better average refraction than a one-time refraction test during an office visit. Especially if someone is having a bad day! The MIT-patented technology powering the VisionCheck has been extensively tested with over 12,000 users over the past 2 years and has been optimized to give excellent refraction values for ordering eyeglasses.    Real tests, real results: Unlike other online vision tests, VisionCheck gives you a true refraction measurement. These results are called ""EyeGlass Numbers"" (EGNs). We do not simply request and renew your prescription. EyeQue products ACTUALLY test your vision and generate real scientific results. Also, there's no wait time; you get refraction results (EGNs) immediately after you complete three refraction tests.  See your data, use your data: Your personalized dashboard can be accessed through your EyeQue account and contains a multitude of information about your vision. This includes detailed reports showing and explaining your results, as well as the consistency of your testing. The report even compares your vision results with the general EyeQue population! Use your most updated EyeGlass Numbers (EGNs) to order glasses online from trusted retailers or share them with your eye care provider.Safe & robust: VisionCheck uses only the illumination from your smartphone screen, filtering the light making it completely safe for your eyes. The VisionCheck device is rugged yet beautifully designed. Internal elements of the device are enclosed in a solid injection molded plastic housing while the precision optics are made from the highest grade polymers; the electronic components are commercially approved as well. VisionCheck has undergone extensive environmental testing including drop, temperature, humidity, and shock tests to ensure that it is safe and robust enough for household use. VisionCheck is registered with the FDA as well.                             Fun and easy to use: Simply launch the app, attach the VisionCheck device, and use the touch sensor buttons to perform a series of game-like actions to overlap the red and green lines as you look through the device. Voila, you get your refraction results in the form of EyeGlass Numbers, instantly. Voice guidance is also available, making it even easier to use. Seriously amazing support: Our success is based on your satisfaction, and we are committed to providing responsive solutions to meet your needs. Some of our members have described us as obsessively customer focused, a compliment that makes us smile. Typically, we respond to any email requests within 24 hours. We also have an online chat service to work through any issue you may be having. Our support staff are in-house professionals that work closely with our software and optical engineers. We also have an extensive database of educational content on vision and health, called ""Knowledge Center"", which can be accessed on our website anytime.We are mindful of your privacy and security. We use HIPAA compliant processes and cloud storage for all your EGNs and personal data. We do not share your information with any organizations for any purposes, EVER. What's inside?Below is an “exploded view” of the patented VisionCheck device. It is a precision optical instrument built with micron-level tolerances. Substantial engineering effort was required in order to build reliable devices on a mass scale. To achieve that, we have employed a team of exceptional industrial designers, mechanical, electrical, optical, and firmware engineers. How it works:The VisionCheck is based on an MIT patented technology licensed exclusively to EyeQue. This technology has been extensively tested in our 1st generation product, the Personal Vision Tracker and uses a variant of the inverse Shack-Hartmann effect. The device projects two parallel beams of light that comes from the smartphone display into your eyes and onto your retina. The beams of light come from red and green lines formed by illuminated pixels on your smartphone, separated by 2.5 mm when they leave the device so that they can fit through your pupil.Using an interactive touch-sensitive interface, the user overlaps the two lines to form what looks like one yellow line. Based on the amount of pixel movement made, EyeQue calculates the user's refractive error in that particular direction. The device then rotates the lines to another angle and you repeat the measurement. Measuring the refractive power over a number of different angles gives the sphere, cylinder, and axis needed to correct your vision with eyeglasses. The method works for most people who are willing and able to follow the instructions we provide.The science behind the device:We cannot explain the science without explaining the human eye first. Nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism occur when the eye lens and eye distance are “out of synch"". Normal distance vision is the result of the light entering the eye and focusing exactly on the retina, where the brain interprets sharp images. Common deviations from normal vision, nearsightedness, or myopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light before your retina; Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light past your retina, both causing the brain to interpret ""blurry"" images. Almost 50% of the human population has some degree of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. These conditions are also known as ""refractive errors"".The EyeQue VisionCheck is an optical device that achieves the effect of a variable corrective lens as it translates pixel spacing on the smartphone screen to corrective powers. To simulate the effect of converging or diverging rays into your eye that a correction lens would provide, you simply move the pixels on the screen closer or further emulating the effect of a corrective lens; overlapping the red and green lines and creating a single yellow line. Think of the VisionCheck as a custom converter of pixel spacing to optical power. Using that conversion, VisionCheck can determine corrections from + 8 D to – 10 D.VisionCheck uses your smartphone's display to work; with a pixel spacing on the order of .07 mm (70 microns) or better– comparatively, about the diameter of a human hair. VisionCheck works well for phones down to 250 Pixels per inch (PPI). Any PPI below 250 means that the resolution is too low for it to be optometrically accurate.The iPhone6s, for example, has an adjacent pixel spacing of 21 microns, and about 63 microns between same color pixels. With this small pixel spacing, VisionCheck exceeds 0.25 Diopter resolution. As a reference,0.25 Diopter accuracy is the level typically achieved by Optometrists.While it is easy to understand how EyeQue can measure the overall optical power for nearsightedness and farsightedness, VisionCheck also gets an accurate measurement of astigmatism by sampling over different angels. To measure astigmatism, a complete set of power measurements is comprised of 9 measurements for your right eye and 9 measurements for your left eye. Measurements are made at increments of 40 degrees and with these measurements, the astigmatism is computed.Yes, that’s a lot of measurements but the device is making measurements of tiny differences that reflect the shape of the eye lens and cornea. About 1 diopter of astigmatism, a typical value implies that the non-spherical component of the eye is about 0.25 mm. 0.25mm is thinner than your average ball-point pen point.All computations are carried out in the EyeQue cloud as it takes a substantial amount of computation that is dependent on many different parameters including the smartphone you are using. As you take more tests, the results are aggregated together through averaging and removing bad data points. Each test is scored based on the goodness of the computed fit to the measurements. An example of test results is shown below.Along with your test results, we also provide you with a measure of the consistency. The plot on the right also shows how other users have performed as shown by the relative size of the blue dots; most but not all users fall into the ""good"" category. Our personalized vision report is a great way to stay in touch with your test results and vision changes.PDCheck:VisionCheck includes another cool test called PDCheck™. Accurate measurement of pupillary distance, PD, is necessary to order prescription eyeglasses. If the measured PD is wrong, you will find the glasses uncomfortable and it will make you feel dizzy. Our patented PDCheck technology uses the smartphone camera to take a “selfie” and extracts the PD to an accuracy of +/- 1 mm. There are a lot of mobile apps out there that have you use a credit card or paper printout held against your forehead .… these simply do not work well due to many factors. PDCheck includes a special set of PD frames with patented T marks on the frames that provide an accurate reference point to determine the distance between the center of your eyes. The great thing about the PD frames is that by wearing them, your hands are free to get a great selfie. PDCheck works with both the front and rear facing cameras of your phone, so you can either measure your own PD or have someone else measure your PD by just taking a picture.The PDCheck app uses image processing to detect the T marks and the pupils of your eyes; it will only work with these special frames. If you are not using the frames the PDCheck app will not give you a PD measurement. Once you take the selfie you can tweak the positions of the cursors a bit to make sure they are in the location that best matches the T’s and center of your eye.Take a selfie and you'll get an automatic PD measurementAdjust the markers to the center of your pupils and T marks (if needed) to get the most accurate PD.For privacy reasons , the selfie image is not saved or uploaded anywhere. We just compute the relevant parameters needed for an accurate PD and upload those values, not the image, to the EyeQue Cloud®. The PD then becomes part of your EyeGlass Numbers and will display on your dashboard. Since your test results are uploaded into the secure EyeQue Cloud®, it allows you to access the data immediately, from both desktop and mobile. EyeQue membership:Users of EyeQue’s products and services are members of the EyeQue Community; each with his/her own personal account.

EyeQue has a family of vision testing products, each complementing another. Many factors were considered in the design of the VisionCheck. We set out to create another refraction device that was better optically, easier to use, and faster than the first-generation product but remained at a low-cost to the consumer.Based on the feedback of our members, we came up with a device that had the following characteristics:1.  A better optical system to allow the display lines to appear 50% larger than the lines in the previous device, making them easier to see therefore improving test efficiency and accuracy.2.  Touch-sensitive test buttons on the VisionCheck device to improve the ergonomics of the test. Combined with the automated screen pattern and silt rotation, the VisionCheck allows you to take the test without ever taking your eyes off the device, so you can maintain focus and completing the test faster. 3.  With a the device that no longer requires manual rotation, we fitted the VisionCheck with an eyecup with a more natural shape. The natural oval shape provides superior comfort and alignment.4.  A device that is aesthetically pleasing; you can view some of the first sketches are shown below.
