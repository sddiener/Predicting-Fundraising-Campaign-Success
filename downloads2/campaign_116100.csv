<p class=""p3"">My name is Zhanna and I am an artist, translator as well as part-time writer living in New York. I started painting and drawing around 5 years ago. 5 1/2 months ago a miracle happened in my life - I gave birth to the cutest girl out there - Sofia. Sofia has definitely inspired me in many various ways. She was the source of inspiration for this particular project too. </p>
<p class=""p3"">I have lots of friends that form non-traditional unions with same gender partners. Two of them recently adopted a little girl from Ukraine. At the moment the girl`s world still spins exclusively around her two dads. But what will happen in several years? When she goes to a pre-school, then school? How much tolerance from the other children growing up in traditional families will she experience? And what will be her path to realization of the fact that she has two dads and no mom, which is not a very common occurence? The same-sex parents and children raised in same-sex families still face a lot of prejudice and unequal treatment.</p>
<p class=""p3"">This short (12-15 pages max) fairy tale narrates a story of a cute panda-bear girl named Sonia adopted by two male New York bears. It is recommended for children aged 3 to 7 but anybody will enjoy reading it. There will be cute illustrations done by me and one of my friends who is also an artist. The fairy tale will describe Sonia`s adventures in New York and will talk in an implied way about the need to be understanding and accepting of the same gender families.</p>

Team members Briana Sanders, Samuel Taylor, Annalise Bissa, Terrell Morrow, and Victor Shaw will compete in the international competition and attend workshops and dialogues facilitated by some of the foremost artists in the youth spoken word community. The team will join over 750 youth from across the United States and places as far away as Leeds, UK, Guam, Trinidad and Tobago, and India.<br/><br/>Team members are participants in InsideOut Literary Arts Projects' Citywide Poets afterschool program and have spent years of work preparing for this opportunity. The slam team has been developing poems and performances that represent the experiences, insights, and struggles of young people in their city. They will share this work with a global audience at BNV (which has received international media coverage, including two HBO specials).<br/><br/>In this way, the slam team hopes to tell a different story of Detroit than the way the city is portrayed by the mainstream media. Instead of only focusing on the abandonment and poverty that much of the city faces, these poets also speak to the legacy of Detroit as a source of immense cultural and intellectual power. The voices of these young people will represent Detroit to the world and then bring that energy back to their community through a series of workshops/report-backs throughout Detroit in Fall 2013 where they will then share their experience at BNV with other youth/youth organizations.<br/><br/>All of the money raised through this this campaign will go toward paying for travel, registration fees, housing, and food for the five team members and their three coaches, Ben Alfaro, Francine Harris, and Justin Rogers. Every donation makes a difference towards making this trip possible. We also have some awesome rewards for everyone who donates! So please check those out, donate what you can, and spread the word to others who might be interested.<br/><br/>This project will not only have a major impact on the lives of these young people but also on all of the people – young and old alike – who they will inspire, uplift, and transform through their written and spoken words.

Now, the

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are 14 Northwestern students, all of different faiths, joining together for the same purpose: to help rebuild New Orleans. Going into this trip, most of us are strangers. Coming out of it, we hope to have new best friends at the very most and a deeper understanding and appreciation of other religions at the very least. And most importantly, a great love for the city of New Orleans. This trip is in its third year and it keeps getting bigger and better as each year passes.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While we are in New Orleans we live in the Lower Ninth Ward, in the heart of the destruction left by Hurricane Katrina. We volunteer with Common Ground Relief (<a href=""http://www.commongroundrelief.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.commongroundrelief.org/</a>) and rebuild homes in the area. We do anything from painting to insulation to roof repairs. From a physical standpoint, we are rebuilding houses with our bare hands. But we are doing so much more than that. We are rebuilding a family's home, their life. We are giving them the chance to live their lives with one less thing to worry about. Interacting with the families and citizens of New Orleans is the most rewarding experience of all, seeing how happy they are to know someone still cares about them.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What We Need: This campaign is meant to help offset the cost of our trip. In order to get 14 people to New Orleans from Chicago, we have to drive 2 minivans, each 927 miles round trip. This means the biggest section of our budget is gas. Our estimated cost at the pump is $700 round trip (courtesy of AAA Fuel Cost Calculator).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What You Get: The satisfaction of knowing you helped a group of students safely reach their destination to achieve their goal of rebuilding New Orleans. You are indirectly helping a family in New Orleans feel at home again and get their community back. And we will be in your debt forever and ever.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Send this on to your friends, families, relatives, anyone who is a Saints fan, anyone who loves alternative spring break trips, or just anyone who loves New Orleans and wants to see it returned to its beautiful, thriving state.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We honestly appreciate anything you can donate. Every little bit counts.<br/></p>

We had a lot of fun, and many great stories came out of that experience together. This is one of our favorites. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462906619/IMG_5609_o6ywnt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>The story follows the life of a young great blue heron and his journey of learning to fly and how to become a good fisherman. In the process he learns about following his heart and being an awesome person. The story is full of fun, wisdom, and love.<br/><br/>Here is an excerpt from the story:<br/><br/>Then, one fine summer day, just as the sun was rising over the magical Sacred Mountain. Daffy sat on the edge of the big branch, dangling his feet above the river. But this time he felt something change deep inside his heart. Somehow, this time he knew that he was ready. This time he could do it. He just knew it! This was something new! He felt good inside. He felt light all over. He pushed himself a little farther out on the branch. <br/>Whoa, it’s so far down,  he thought.  But the feeling in his heart became even stronger.  He felt so excited. He just knew he could fly. In fact, he couldn’t wait another minute! He held his breath, gave one big push, and fell off the branch, plummeting into the wide open air.<br/>“AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!” he screamed. “What do I do? What do I do ? What do I doooooo?!!!”<br/><br/><br/>I wonder what happens :)<br/><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464811911/page1-color_rkt6dp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>I love nature. The book is illustrated with photographs of nature. I have a collection of nature texture images that I have taken over the years. The colors and textures make for visually beautiful and unique illustrations. First I draw the illustrations, then I fill in the sections using photographs. My son helps me choose the perfect image, we have a lot of fun doing it together. The illustrations are so vibrant, joyful, and beautiful.<br/><br/>I hope to inspire kids to get out into nature and look for all the amazing textures and life that exists there. The beauty of the natural world is so amazing and connects us with a deeper part of ourselves. I think it can help everyone to see nature in everything, and everything in nature. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462906808/fern_lake-029_mqnzju.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">INSPIRING KIDS TO LOVE NATURE</h2><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464812165/tablet_jlyusk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>THE APP</h2>The APP will be a story with pages you can flip through, just like the real book.

Last day to order a book.
Everyone who contributes any amount today will receive a free eBook version of the story and a coloring book of all of the illustrations from the story. These will be sent to you in email.Thank you and many blessings,Dustin eQuiet as the Breeze, Still as the Trees, and Fast as Lightning.A story about following your heart and being awesome. Inspiring kids to connect with nature.It’s a BOOK and an interactive story APP. You can get either or both, you choose :)THE STORYWhen my son was younger, I would make up stories for bedtime. We had a lot of fun, and many great stories came out of that experience together. This is one of our favorites. The story follows the life of a young great blue heron and his journey of learning to fly and how to become a good fisherman. In the process he learns about following his heart and being an awesome person. The story is full of fun, wisdom, and love.Here is an excerpt from the story:Then, one fine summer day, just as the sun was rising over the magical Sacred Mountain. Daffy sat on the edge of the big branch, dangling his feet above the river. But this time he felt something change deep inside his heart. Somehow, this time he knew that he was ready. This time he could do it. He just knew it! This was something new! He felt good inside. He felt light all over. He pushed himself a little farther out on the branch. Whoa, it’s so far down,  he thought.  But the feeling in his heart became even stronger.  He felt so excited. He just knew he could fly. In fact, he couldn’t wait another minute! He held his breath, gave one big push, and fell off the branch, plummeting into the wide open air.“AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!” he screamed. “What do I do? What do I do ? What do I doooooo?!!!”I wonder what happens :)I love nature. The book is illustrated with photographs of nature. I have a collection of nature texture images that I have taken over the years. The colors and textures make for visually beautiful and unique illustrations. First I draw the illustrations, then I fill in the sections using photographs. My son helps me choose the perfect image, we have a lot of fun doing it together. The illustrations are so vibrant, joyful, and beautiful.I hope to inspire kids to get out into nature and look for all the amazing textures and life that exists there. The beauty of the natural world is so amazing and connects us with a deeper part of ourselves. I think it can help everyone to see nature in everything, and everything in nature. INSPIRING KIDS TO LOVE NATURETHE APPThe APP will be a story with pages you can flip through, just like the real book. But, you will also be able to click on each of the illustration sections to see the full image that was used. With the popup image there will also be some fun nature tips about the image.The APP will also include an audio version of the story. Each page will have a play button so you can listen to me telling the story while viewing the artwork and images. I think this is so great for kids who do not have someone to read for them. You will also be able to read the story, and just view the images. TECHNICAL DETAILSThe books will be professionally printed in full color on quality paper.There are 15 illustrations and 32 pages.The APP will be available for iOS and Android mobile phones, and tablets. *** Once the app has been developed you will be sent a promo code so you can access the app.WHY AM I ASKING FOR YOUR ENCOURAGEMENTI have the story, I have the vision, and the illustrations are in progress, right now.

<p>All valid questions. We have myths talking about civilization before massive flooding. How a great catastrophe destroyed much of humanity and only a few survivors made it to carry on civilization.</p>
<p>We know during the Ice Age that the seas were a lot lower and that exposed lands were fertile over thousands of years of exposure.

<p><br/></p>
<p> Hello, my name is James Grimm and I am the author of the fictional tale, Wall of Destruction. Until recently, I was a long time IT network engineer working in Japan. I had always wanted to write a book but never really found the time to do it. Always something came up that stopped me. Well, for better or worse, that is no longer an issue.</p>
<p>Wall of Destruction, a When Atlantis Fell novel, came about from my love for ancient history and fantasy. I loved to read about ancient civilizations and imagine what it was like to live back then. Why did they build these monuments or how did they discover certain things. <br/></p>
<p>This book and the follow up series of stories will explore my imagination of how these things came about in adventure stories set at the end of Atlantis' reign. This particular one is a story about a man named Risor, a citizen of Atlantis, and how he survives the catastrophes that brought about the end of Atlantis.  <br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I want to have a successful career as a writer and I believe that presenting a well written story with eye catching artwork is my best chance. I ask for your help in giving me a chance to realize this dream. Those that contribute will always be remembered for helping me get started in this career.<br/></p>Could I be successful? Always a possibility but not guaranteed. Please consider it not just an investment in the book, which I hope to make truly enjoyable, but in the author as well.  Please look at the last section on this campaign to read additional passages from what I have already completed. Also on my blog (<a href=""http://jegrimm.wordpress.com/2014/06/10/wall-of-destruction-preview-draft-version/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://jegrimm.wordpress.com/2014/06/10/wall-of...</a>), I have the first 20+ pages of the book that provides  a lot of set up.<br/><p></p>
<br/><h2>Donation usage.<br/>
</h2>
</div><div> <p>Have you ever read a book that had numerous grammar mistakes or the story didn't flow? Not enjoyable, right? You might not give the author a second chance or a negative review.</p>
<p>Mistakes are natural, everyone makes them. Having another person check your work helps identify things that you don't see. Hiring professional copy editors to review my manuscript should significantly reduce the mistakes. Make the reading, for you, a more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Same for cover art. On most on-line stores, each book has a second or two to catch the attention of a casual browser. The old saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" is wrong when it comes to on-line buyers. A good story, with a lousy cover, would be passed over most of the time. In this campaign, the only art work that I need, is the cover art. All other art in the book will be paid for if the right level of perks are selected.</p>

<br/>These costs are estimates as the book is not complete. Currently at 60,000 words (170 pages) and not quite two-thirds complete. Top end number is assuming 120,000 words.<br/><br/>Other costs include taxes, Indiegogo's fee and any financial transfer fees. <br/><br/>If the goal is not met, I will use whatever funds are available; first for copy editing and then cover art. <br/><br/>As described below in the perks section, this book can really be enhanced if the higher level perks are chosen and numerous stretch goals are met. All obligations to the primary funding goals and perks will be met first. Additional funding can help me concentrate on producing this book as my primary job.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>The biggest challenge to completing this book is my time. Being unemployed, for the last few months, I have had plenty of time to work on this and I believe I have used my time wisely. If I need to find a job, then I can not guarantee this book will be finished, this year, as the new job must be my first priority.<br/><br/>I will continue to work on the book and any funds donated will still be used for the act of publishing this book. If not this year, then I should have it complete by mid-2015. <br/><br/>All contributors will be kept apprised of the book's status via Email or my blog. (<a href=""http://jegrimm.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://jegrimm.wordpress.com</a>)<br/><br/><br/><h2>What you are investing in.</h2>Part of a career, as an author, is that you need to have more than one book idea pending. I have planned that this book will be the foundation for up to five short stories/novellas that I will then group into an anthology. These shorts will deal with situations or characters that are briefly encountered in Wall of Destruction. For example, in the preview, on my blog, you encounter Rogat.<br/><br/>Rogat is in the Atlantean infantry, while Risor could be considered air force. Rogat is fighting, in what is now Eastern Europe, and is also affected by the floods but in a different way. He does not play a big part in Wall of Destruction, but he will have a story of his own.<br/><br/>After this book and the anthology, I plan on writing another full novel on the Raman Empire, Atlantis' foe. An anthology of events from that novel, will follow as well. <br/><br/>A future novel and anthology could follow, if the series is really popular or I could start one of my other fantasy worlds in a series of books/anthologies. <br/><br/><br/><h2>Let's talk about Perks</h2>I thought pretty hard on what could I do to motivate and reward those that contribute. We could have went for the little flashy light, noise makers but then I thought who would want that? Kids might, ya they would. They like flashy noise makers that drive parents crazy. Problem is kids don't normally do the contributing and most parents are not into buying things that will torture them. Relatives might do that and send it to you. But I digress.<br/><br/>So I thought let's try to make it something you can use or if I get lucky and become famous, you can appreciate what you have. So taking this tack, the perks graduate up to collector quality and rarity. Please realize that, at least now, my thinking is to just publish on-line. In the future, if you want a physical book, it will be on demand by you.

</p><h3>Flee for your
lives!</h3>
<p>Risor
awakens to the tolling of the bells and yelling coming from the
streets below. Racing to the hallway, he meets other family members
and servants.  Everyone is demanding to know what is going on, with
servants charging off in all directions to try and get some answers.
Rosan orders everyone back to dress and prepare a few changes of
clothes.</p>
<p>	Maybe
the Ramans have finally decided to strike the Atlantean colonies on
this side of the world. Risor quickly dressed and went down to the
house courtyard below.  Servants were hustling back and forth with
his father directing actions.  A small stack of bags and such were
already gathered in the courtyard.</p>
<p>	“What
is going on father?” cried Risor.</p>
<p>	“We
do not know yet but the order is to evacuate to the hills.”</p>
<p>	In
moments, an officer of the town guard comes through the front gate
with one of the servants sent to find out what is going on. 
</p>
<p>	“My
lords, Sub-commander Ruland.  We are ordering an evacuation of the
city.  There is a great flood coming from the north and it will be
here in one to two hours. Please gather what you can easily carry and
head out the Morning Gate.  It will be the quickest way to the
hills.” turning to Rosan. “Elder Councilman Tarnor, Councilman
Zailor advises the council should meet  at Sun's Farewell bluff as
soon as possible.  We will maintain that as our headquarters until
the crisis is over.”</p>
<p>	“Sub-commander,
what of the vailixi? I have some of my unit here.” Risor asked.</p>
<p>	“All
of the vailixi are in the air going north or to Sun's Farewell bluff
as part of the command hub. I believe that means your craft as well,
sir.”</p>
<p>	Rosan
put his hand on Risor's shoulder. “Son, I need you here to help me
with our household.”</p>
<p>	“I
will stay father, but I need to make sure that my people are okay.
Thank you sub-commander.” As the guardsman saluted and then left.</p>
<p>	“Flood
eh?” Risor remembered what Tolen said. “Father if this is related
to what Tolen told us before, it could be very bad.”</p>
<p>	“Yes
he told us too. We need to get everyone moving.”</p>
<p>	Within
fifteen minutes, the family, servants and baggage was on the move.
While not running, especially since it was still a long distance, the
group moved quickly. Along with hundreds of other fleeing residents. 
</p>
<p>	Within
the city proper, the streets are well lit and it was easy to see
dropped items that someone before them had second thoughts about
taking. The streets were strewn with debris from those fleeing.
Luckily for the Tarnors, their home opened onto one of the main
thoroughfares and they quickly exited the city gate.</p>
<p>	The
road was lit for a ways but soon the city lights were no longer
available.  Hundreds were on the road to the hills with all manner of
wagons or animals as beasts of burden. Risor would not mind having
one of the aether wagons at this time, that would allow them to
pretty much run along side the road a few feet off the ground. They
couldn't stay on the road with all the other people but as long as
the ground near the road was flat they could use that.</p>
<p>	With
only star light, the occasional torch or aether light to light their
way it was pretty scary for those fleeing. They moved on pretty much
in silence so they can hear when the waters are coming.  The silence
was broken by vailixi occasionally flying overhead with their aether
lights beaming along the road. The light showed how much junk was
already thrown to the sides as people feared not making it and threw
their belongings away to move quicker.</p>
<p>	Risor
believes they were half way to the hills when up ahead an animal
bellowed and then an aether spear shot the beast. Many of the animals
near Risor's family were getting skittish, which Risor thought meant
the flood is getting closer. He had heard Tolen say that animals have
a sense, like those who control the use of aether, to detect when
danger is coming.</p>
<p>	When
they got to where the beast was killed, they saw a group trying to
remove it from the road.</p><p>
</p><p>	“Citizens,
leave it, it is to one side and there is little time.  Pick up your
gear and move on.” Said Rosan to the crowd. 
</p>
<p>	The
people didn't seem to need much convincing, they dropped their holds
on the beast and moved on.</p>
<p>	“Father,
the beast will still block any larger wagons coming up the road.”
Rina finally spoke, she seemed in a state of shock since leaving
their home.</p>
<p>	“Honey,
any wagon that big will not move quickly with all these people in the
way and if it did, it would more than likely run people over.” When
she didn't say anything, he added, “Better that one wagon be left
than many people harmed in the driver's attempt to reach safety.”
Again no response.</p>
......<p>
</p><h3>When
civilizations fall...</h3>
....<p>
</p><p>	The first thing
Risor wanted to do is head towards the city of Neptius. So they
banked left and went along the coastline. Large sections of the
coastline were washed away. Where before there was a distinct
coastline with little swamp, now the coastline has become a maze of islets and vast marshes. A lot of debris was
littering the coastline. This resulted in the beach no longer considered the best path for travel, any travel would have to be further inland.</p>
<p>	As the land
started to turn south,  what will become the Florida peninsula,
the coastline continued to look the same. The flood was already
raising sea levels in the Gulf enough to pour into low lying areas
just behind the coastlines further creating barrier islands. Large sections were now underwater. It will
only get worse, Risor thought. 
</p>
<p>	On the other side
of the peninsula, facing the Home Ocean, further south was the city
of Neptius, almost the same size as Altai and older than Altai by
about two thousand years. Long ages ago when the Atlanteans only had
sailing ships, Neptius was their first colony. From there they
discovered the rest of the smaller landmass, founded colonies or
traded with the natives. There were no large kingdoms in this new
world like there are in the old world.</p>
<p>	Risor's vailixi
crossed the peninsula to the Home Ocean side and then turned south.
The Home Ocean coast was also wiped out from the tsunami coming from
the north. Half of the beaches that used to grace the shore line were
gone or covered in debris. 
</p>
<p>	Near the bottom
of the peninsula there was three straits that separated the mainland
from two large islands; that will become Cuba and Greater Bahama.
Where the three straits converged is where Neptius was founded. The
city boasted a large lighthouse, largest in the world for incoming
ships. The tower was larger than the temple mounts of the city, they
had three; one for Poseidon, another for Zeus and the last for
Athena. The land to the southwest of Neptius was a swamp while some
farming was done to the north and on the islands. The port of Neptius
was the busiest in the world. Smaller ships would sail to Neptius
from the other colonies, including Altai, and then larger aether
enabled ships would ship the freight to Atlantis or ports from the
other side of the world. Aether enabled ships have been in use for
the last thousand years and rarely ever sink due to the use of
aether. This method of transport ensures no loss of life would occur
anymore.</p>
<p>	As they got
closer to Neptius, Risor was worried. They have not received any
communications from anyone at Neptius, even the aether-enabled ships
and that did not bode well for the people of Neptius. As the vailixi
reached the northern end of the northern strait, Risor knew what
happened. The strait was not quite a strait anymore. 
</p>
<p>	The Gulf
connected to the Home Ocean through these straits and a tiny strait
to the southwest on the other side of Cuba. With the flood and the
force of water entering the Gulf it poured out these narrow paths at
much higher pressure than normal. The northern end of this strait was
just a sample of what high pressured flow can do to land. What was
normally a twenty mile strait was now more than a hundred miles wide.
The flow out of the Gulf was eating away at the Florida pennisula and
the islands. 
</p>
<p>	As the vailixi
got closer to Neptius, from a distance Risor saw two of the temples
still standing but not the other nor the lighthouse. The power of the
water pouring through the straits made the water in the straits
brown. Half of the city had already disappeared below the waves, the
rest was smashed, apparently from the tsunami, with almost no
building undamaged. 
</p>
<p>	Even as Risor and
team flew over them, some buildings were finally surrendering to the
powerful currents that engulfed them. Falling apart to disappear
beneath the waters. Large stones from the two surviving temple mounts
were tumbling away. It would be only a matter of time, maybe just
hours, before both temples to Poseidon and Athena were completely
destroyed and joined the temple of Zeus beneath the waves. The temple
mount to Poseidon still had an active Mother Stone as the blue lights
of aether shown through the damaged entrance. 
</p>
<p>	The Mother Stone
would have been a blessing to have but it would require a few of his
people to go in there to retrieve it. Reluctantly the temple mount
didn't look very stable with one side already being eaten away by the
water. With the debris up near the entrance, it could also be under
water making the task of removal even more difficult. No, his people
would have to get a Mother Stone another way.</p>
<p>	Risor was not
sure but he believed Neptius had over six hundred large buildings and
covered a few square miles. Now there were only a few dozen left and
debris was strewn through the streets around them or they were
partially destroyed. As the vailixi came to the aeroport, they saw
two vailixi smashed against a wall. Neither looked flyable. One was
at the edge of the water and looked like it would slide away at any
moment the other was on dry land for the moment. 
</p>
<p>	Risor landed next
to the dry land one while his other vailixi continued to circle the
city in the vain hope to find some survivors. As Risor and Milo left
the vailixi the sound of the water was deafening. Creaks and snapping
sounds of the buildings was heard everywhere. They walked to the
damaged craft when the smell of rotting corpses hit them. The vailixi
was on its side with its top facing the wall it was pushed up
against. The access ramp was partially open and as they got closer to
it, they saw arm wedged under the ramp. The birds and other
scavengers have not found this site yet it seems.</p>
<p>	The slightly open
access ramp was forming a nice barricade to entry with the wall. It
seemed the only way for them to gain access or at least to see inside
was to climb the access ramp to enter from the top. 
</p>
<p>	“Milo give me a
boost. I want to see inside to see if there is any chance of
salvaging something from inside.”</p>
<p>	Milo was a tough
man but looked uneasy as he was looking at the almost severed arm
below the ramp.</p>
<p>	“Don't worry
Milo, that poor soul won't feel a thing.” So they moved some of the
debris away from the ramp so they can get close to the ramp. 
</p>
<p>	“Uh, that smell
is bad, I don't think there is just one here sir.”</p>
<p>	“Probably the
crew never got this far.” As Risor put his foot in Milo's clasped
hands and sprung up. He grasped the edge then pulled himself up.</p>
<p>	The smell really
hit him and a flock of ravens sped past him, surprising him enough
that he almost lost his handholds on the ramp. Once the flock fled,
he saw what they were about. The vailixi was filled with bodies,
three to four deep. All with black bloated faces and bodies. Children
and adults.</p>
<p>	Risor fell down
as he gasped for air while puking his guts out. A few ravens angrily
cawed from the top of the wall at the humans for interrupting their
feast. A few of the braver or hungrier ones already were flying back
into the doomed vailixi.</p>
<p>	Once he could
control his retching, “The Gods help us, they tried to use it to
escape. Maybe thirty or forty men, women and children. I think...”
As he started to retch again at the visual of their faces.</p>
<p>	“Never mind
sir, I think I know what happened.”</p>
<p>	Milo stood up and
looked back at the vailixi. Without turning, “Should we fire the
insides?”</p>
<p>	When Risor could
get back to a semblance of normality, “That isn't a bad idea. Not
so much for the dead, animals need to eat too, but the explosion
might get any survivors to pop their head up.” 
</p>
...<br/><p><br/></p>
<br/><p><br/></p><br/></div>","What if Atlantis existed, why did it fail?

If there was a prehistoric civilization, what would it be like? Why wouldn't we know about it? Where is the proof of its existence? 


All valid questions. We have myths talking about civilization before massive flooding. How a great catastrophe destroyed much of humanity and only a few survivors made it to carry on civilization.
We know during the Ice Age that the seas were a lot lower and that exposed lands were fertile over thousands of years of exposure. We know there was a land bridge between Asia and North America, that there was a massive landmass connecting most of Southeast Asia, that the Persian Gulf was a large river valley and that the Gulf of Mexico was a lot smaller.

What if there were cities along the coasts of these now underwater continental shelves?

Man likes to build near oceans and rivers. If there was a civilization 10,000+ BC, more than likely they would build their cities near the shoreline of 10,000+ BC, not where it is today.

 Hello, my name is James Grimm and I am the author of the fictional tale, Wall of Destruction. Until recently, I was a long time IT network engineer working in Japan. I had always wanted to write a book but never really found the time to do it. Always something came up that stopped me. Well, for better or worse, that is no longer an issue.
Wall of Destruction, a When Atlantis Fell novel, came about from my love for ancient history and fantasy. I loved to read about ancient civilizations and imagine what it was like to live back then. Why did they build these monuments or how did they discover certain things. 
This book and the follow up series of stories will explore my imagination of how these things came about in adventure stories set at the end of Atlantis' reign. This particular one is a story about a man named Risor, a citizen of Atlantis, and how he survives the catastrophes that brought about the end of Atlantis.  
 
I want to have a successful career as a writer and I believe that presenting a well written story with eye catching artwork is my best chance. I ask for your help in giving me a chance to realize this dream. Those that contribute will always be remembered for helping me get started in this career.Could I be successful? Always a possibility but not guaranteed. Please consider it not just an investment in the book, which I hope to make truly enjoyable, but in the author as well.  Please look at the last section on this campaign to read additional passages from what I have already completed. Also on my blog (http://jegrimm.wordpress.com/2014/06/10/wall-of...), I have the first 20+ pages of the book that provides  a lot of set up.
Donation usage.

 Have you ever read a book that had numerous grammar mistakes or the story didn't flow? Not enjoyable, right? You might not give the author a second chance or a negative review.
Mistakes are natural, everyone makes them. Having another person check your work helps identify things that you don't see. Hiring professional copy editors to review my manuscript should significantly reduce the mistakes. Make the reading, for you, a more enjoyable experience.
Same for cover art. On most on-line stores, each book has a second or two to catch the attention of a casual browser. The old saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" is wrong when it comes to on-line buyers. A good story, with a lousy cover, would be passed over most of the time. In this campaign, the only art work that I need, is the cover art. All other art in the book will be paid for if the right level of perks are selected.





Item needed
     Cost per item           

Total expected cost


copy edit
0.02-3 per word
1,600-3,600 USD


development edit     
0.02-3 per word
1,600-3,600 USD


cover art
n/a
$500-1200 USD


These costs are estimates as the book is not complete. Currently at 60,000 words (170 pages) and not quite two-thirds complete. Top end number is assuming 120,000 words.Other costs include taxes, Indiegogo's fee and any financial transfer fees. If the goal is not met, I will use whatever funds are available; first for copy editing and then cover art. As described below in the perks section, this book can really be enhanced if the higher level perks are chosen and numerous stretch goals are met. All obligations to the primary funding goals and perks will be met first. Additional funding can help me concentrate on producing this book as my primary job.Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge to completing this book is my time. Being unemployed, for the last few months, I have had plenty of time to work on this and I believe I have used my time wisely. If I need to find a job, then I can not guarantee this book will be finished, this year, as the new job must be my first priority.I will continue to work on the book and any funds donated will still be used for the act of publishing this book. If not this year, then I should have it complete by mid-2015. All contributors will be kept apprised of the book's status via Email or my blog. (http://jegrimm.wordpress.com)What you are investing in.Part of a career, as an author, is that you need to have more than one book idea pending. I have planned that this book will be the foundation for up to five short stories/novellas that I will then group into an anthology. These shorts will deal with situations or characters that are briefly encountered in Wall of Destruction. For example, in the preview, on my blog, you encounter Rogat.Rogat is in the Atlantean infantry, while Risor could be considered air force. Rogat is fighting, in what is now Eastern Europe, and is also affected by the floods but in a different way. He does not play a big part in Wall of Destruction, but he will have a story of his own.After this book and the anthology, I plan on writing another full novel on the Raman Empire, Atlantis' foe. An anthology of events from that novel, will follow as well. A future novel and anthology could follow, if the series is really popular or I could start one of my other fantasy worlds in a series of books/anthologies. Let's talk about PerksI thought pretty hard on what could I do to motivate and reward those that contribute. We could have went for the little flashy light, noise makers but then I thought who would want that? Kids might, ya they would. They like flashy noise makers that drive parents crazy. Problem is kids don't normally do the contributing and most parents are not into buying things that will torture them. Relatives might do that and send it to you. But I digress.So I thought let's try to make it something you can use or if I get lucky and become famous, you can appreciate what you have. So taking this tack, the perks graduate up to collector quality and rarity. Please realize that, at least now, my thinking is to just publish on-line. In the future, if you want a physical book, it will be on demand by you. I do not plan on making physical books which will also add to the rarity of this campaign's perks.There is another value in this campaign and that will be the stretch goals. If the higher level perks are selected these will definitely pass the stated GOAL of the campaign. So I have made higher level stretch goals that really ""spice"" up the offerings. I believe these additions to the book and to the perks will further add value to this book and will go far in helping this being a successful book launch.Stretch GoalsHopefully not dreaming too much but figured I would show what we can do if we all work together.1st Stretch goal:   50,000

eh?” Risor remembered what Tolen said. “Father if this is related
to what Tolen told us before, it could be very bad.”
	“Yes
he told us too. We need to get everyone moving.”
	Within
fifteen minutes, the family, servants and baggage was on the move.
While not running, especially since it was still a long distance, the
group moved quickly. Along with hundreds of other fleeing residents. 

	Within
the city proper, the streets are well lit and it was easy to see
dropped items that someone before them had second thoughts about
taking. The streets were strewn with debris from those fleeing.
Luckily for the Tarnors, their home opened onto one of the main
thoroughfares and they quickly exited the city gate.
	The
road was lit for a ways but soon the city lights were no longer
available.  Hundreds were on the road to the hills with all manner of
wagons or animals as beasts of burden. Risor would not mind having
one of the aether wagons at this time, that would allow them to
pretty much run along side the road a few feet off the ground. They
couldn't stay on the road with all the other people but as long as
the ground near the road was flat they could use that.
	With
only star light, the occasional torch or aether light to light their
way it was pretty scary for those fleeing. They moved on pretty much
in silence so they can hear when the waters are coming.  The silence
was broken by vailixi occasionally flying overhead with their aether
lights beaming along the road. The light showed how much junk was
already thrown to the sides as people feared not making it and threw
their belongings away to move quicker.
	Risor
believes they were half way to the hills when up ahead an animal
bellowed and then an aether spear shot the beast. Many of the animals
near Risor's family were getting skittish, which Risor thought meant
the flood is getting closer. He had heard Tolen say that animals have
a sense, like those who control the use of aether, to detect when
danger is coming.
	When
they got to where the beast was killed, they saw a group trying to
remove it from the road.
	“Citizens,
leave it, it is to one side and there is little time.  Pick up your
gear and move on.” Said Rosan to the crowd. 

	The
people didn't seem to need much convincing, they dropped their holds
on the beast and moved on.
	“Father,
the beast will still block any larger wagons coming up the road.”
Rina finally spoke, she seemed in a state of shock since leaving
their home.
	“Honey,
any wagon that big will not move quickly with all these people in the
way and if it did, it would more than likely run people over.” When
she didn't say anything, he added, “Better that one wagon be left
than many people harmed in the driver's attempt to reach safety.”
Again no response.
......
When
civilizations fall...
....
	The first thing
Risor wanted to do is head towards the city of Neptius. So they
banked left and went along the coastline. Large sections of the
coastline were washed away. Where before there was a distinct
coastline with little swamp, now the coastline has become a maze of islets and vast marshes. A lot of debris was
littering the coastline. This resulted in the beach no longer considered the best path for travel, any travel would have to be further inland.
	As the land
started to turn south,  what will become the Florida peninsula,
the coastline continued to look the same. The flood was already
raising sea levels in the Gulf enough to pour into low lying areas
just behind the coastlines further creating barrier islands. Large sections were now underwater. It will
only get worse, Risor thought. 

	On the other side
of the peninsula, facing the Home Ocean, further south was the city
of Neptius, almost the same size as Altai and older than Altai by
about two thousand years. Long ages ago when the Atlanteans only had
sailing ships, Neptius was their first colony. From there they
discovered the rest of the smaller landmass, founded colonies or
traded with the natives. There were no large kingdoms in this new
world like there are in the old world.
	Risor's vailixi
crossed the peninsula to the Home Ocean side and then turned south.
The Home Ocean coast was also wiped out from the tsunami coming from
the north. Half of the beaches that used to grace the shore line were
gone or covered in debris. 

	Near the bottom
of the peninsula there was three straits that separated the mainland
from two large islands; that will become Cuba and Greater Bahama.
Where the three straits converged is where Neptius was founded. The
city boasted a large lighthouse, largest in the world for incoming
ships. The tower was larger than the temple mounts of the city, they
had three; one for Poseidon, another for Zeus and the last for
Athena. The land to the southwest of Neptius was a swamp while some
farming was done to the north and on the islands. The port of Neptius
was the busiest in the world. Smaller ships would sail to Neptius
from the other colonies, including Altai, and then larger aether
enabled ships would ship the freight to Atlantis or ports from the
other side of the world. Aether enabled ships have been in use for
the last thousand years and rarely ever sink due to the use of
aether. This method of transport ensures no loss of life would occur
anymore.
	As they got
closer to Neptius, Risor was worried. They have not received any
communications from anyone at Neptius, even the aether-enabled ships
and that did not bode well for the people of Neptius. As the vailixi
reached the northern end of the northern strait, Risor knew what
happened. The strait was not quite a strait anymore. 

	The Gulf
connected to the Home Ocean through these straits and a tiny strait
to the southwest on the other side of Cuba. With the flood and the
force of water entering the Gulf it poured out these narrow paths at
much higher pressure than normal. The northern end of this strait was
just a sample of what high pressured flow can do to land. What was
normally a twenty mile strait was now more than a hundred miles wide.
The flow out of the Gulf was eating away at the Florida pennisula and
the islands. 

	As the vailixi
got closer to Neptius, from a distance Risor saw two of the temples
still standing but not the other nor the lighthouse. The power of the
water pouring through the straits made the water in the straits
brown. Half of the city had already disappeared below the waves, the
rest was smashed, apparently from the tsunami, with almost no
building undamaged. 

	Even as Risor and
team flew over them, some buildings were finally surrendering to the
powerful currents that engulfed them. Falling apart to disappear
beneath the waters. Large stones from the two surviving temple mounts
were tumbling away. It would be only a matter of time, maybe just
hours, before both temples to Poseidon and Athena were completely
destroyed and joined the temple of Zeus beneath the waves. The temple
mount to Poseidon still had an active Mother Stone as the blue lights
of aether shown through the damaged entrance. 

	The Mother Stone
would have been a blessing to have but it would require a few of his
people to go in there to retrieve it. Reluctantly the temple mount
didn't look very stable with one side already being eaten away by the
water. With the debris up near the entrance, it could also be under
water making the task of removal even more difficult. No, his people
would have to get a Mother Stone another way.
	Risor was not
sure but he believed Neptius had over six hundred large buildings and
covered a few square miles. Now there were only a few dozen left and
debris was strewn through the streets around them or they were
partially destroyed. As the vailixi came to the aeroport, they saw
two vailixi smashed against a wall. Neither looked flyable. One was
at the edge of the water and looked like it would slide away at any
moment the other was on dry land for the moment. 

	Risor landed next
to the dry land one while his other vailixi continued to circle the
city in the vain hope to find some survivors. As Risor and Milo left
the vailixi the sound of the water was deafening. Creaks and snapping
sounds of the buildings was heard everywhere. They walked to the
damaged craft when the smell of rotting corpses hit them. The vailixi
was on its side with its top facing the wall it was pushed up
against. The access ramp was partially open and as they got closer to
it, they saw arm wedged under the ramp. The birds and other
scavengers have not found this site yet it seems.
	The slightly open
access ramp was forming a nice barricade to entry with the wall. It
seemed the only way for them to gain access or at least to see inside
was to climb the access ramp to enter from the top. 

	“Milo give me a
boost. I want to see inside to see if there is any chance of
salvaging something from inside.”
	Milo was a tough
man but looked uneasy as he was looking at the almost severed arm
below the ramp.
	“Don't worry
Milo, that poor soul won't feel a thing.” So they moved some of the
debris away from the ramp so they can get close to the ramp. 

	“Uh, that smell
is bad, I don't think there is just one here sir.”
	“Probably the
crew never got this far.” As Risor put his foot in Milo's clasped
hands and sprung up. He grasped the edge then pulled himself up.
	The smell really
hit him and a flock of ravens sped past him, surprising him enough
that he almost lost his handholds on the ramp. Once the flock fled,
he saw what they were about. The vailixi was filled with bodies,
three to four deep. All with black bloated faces and bodies. Children
and adults.
	Risor fell down
as he gasped for air while puking his guts out. A few ravens angrily
cawed from the top of the wall at the humans for interrupting their
feast. A few of the braver or hungrier ones already were flying back
into the doomed vailixi.
	Once he could
control his retching, “The Gods help us, they tried to use it to
escape. Maybe thirty or forty men, women and children. I think...”
As he started to retch again at the visual of their faces.
	“Never mind
sir, I think I know what happened.”
	Milo stood up and
looked back at the vailixi. Without turning, “Should we fire the
insides?”
	When Risor could
get back to a semblance of normality, “That isn't a bad idea. Not
so much for the dead, animals need to eat too, but the explosion
might get any survivors to pop their head up.”

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Outside of Your Head explores a different way of looking at mental illness. This book denies the traditional idea of looking at mental illness as something that you “cure”. It recognizes that, what we view as mental illness, is a part of who you are. The focus shouldn’t be on getting rid of that part of you, but rather, it should be on how to best manage the symptoms that come out of it. This book follows my experiences with not only accepting this different view, but also embracing this disposition in a positive way. A book about mental illness and the overall human experience, Outside of Your Headproves to aim that mental illness is more than just “in your head”.<br/><br/>My name is Nikolina Kosanovic and I am the author of Outside of Your Head. I wrote this book because mental illness is a very near and dear topic to my heart. I’ve dealt with my diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and I’ve also seen it affect the lives of many people I love. <br/><br/>My diagnosis is something that has had a lot of stigma around it, and for the longest time, I was really private about it. When I finally started opening up to people, they doubted me. They told me that I didn’t have a mental illness, I just had an attitude problem, or that I needed to be more grateful for what I had. Some people couldn’t believe that it was true because of how happy and successful I seemed to them. The worst part was that I felt like a failure for feeling like I was taking every step to cure it and always coming up short. <br/><br/>When I finally realized that there was no cure, and it would always be a part of me, I felt free. I started to enjoy how the tools for managing the symptoms made me feel, rather than being disappointed by them for not meeting my expectations of curing me. This journey of reflecting on, accepting, and embracing mental illness was something I wanted to share with others in hopes of getting that weight off their shoulders. It’s a very human book that not only applies to those who are bipolar but every single one of us.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover lessons, reflections, and skills that can aid in your journey of managing your symptoms, or understanding the loved ones in your life who are affected by mental illness. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for self-development and personal growth in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you use your emotions and experiences in productive ways.<br/><br/>This book is broken down into 3 sections:<ul>
<li>Accept - Lessons that, once accepted, can make managing your emotions easier</li>
<li>Reflect - Stories and lessons on how I tackled different themes with managing my mental illness</li>
<li>Embrace - The skills I developed from successfully managing my symptoms</li>
</ul>You will love this book if you like slightly sarcastic candor and relatable life experiences.<br/><br/>Outside of Your Head is a non-fiction book that speaks to those who deal with depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and the people in their lives who would like to better understand them. <h2> </h2>
<h2>The Book - Outside of Your Head</h2>The book is written in 4 Parts....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong>- Introduction + background chapters. This part of the book is focused on defining terms, giving technical information on mental illness, and introducing my story to set up the rest of the sections.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong>- Accept. As mentioned, the Accept section is all based on lessons I learned about my place in this world, and how accepting them helped me change the way I framed the support systems in my life.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong>- Reflect.Reflect is more personal, and it deals with topics like context, anger, forgiveness, and all the different human experiences that my mental illness has been closely related to in life.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong>- Embrace. Embrace is the wrap-up, and it shows how the symptoms manifesting into certain behaviors have fueled a lot of my success. Symptoms suck, so it’s nice to know that we can get something out of dealing with them.<p> </p>

going to be a few more kilometers, and one or two more days, but a trail that
was formerly shared also by Charlemagne, Saint Francis of Assisi, Paulo Cohelo,
and many more, is now open for me to be part of it as well. I will begin at the
town of Saint Jean Pied du Port, in France, on August 2<sup>nd</sup> early in
the morning, crossing the Pyrenees to reach Roncesvalles and continue on the
French Way, to Santiago, Finisterra and finally Muxia.</p>

Recientemente he entendido que ha de ser una mejor opción replantear la ruta, optando por iniciar en Francia, en el camino original. Unos cuantos kilómetros adicionales y uno o dos días más, pero un camino que en el pasado fue también compartido por Carlo Magno, San Francisco de Asis, Paulo Cohelo, entre otras grandes personas... se abre ahora para que yo, también, sea parte de él. He de partir, entonces, en la población de Saint Jean Pied du Port, en Francia, el 2 de agosto temprano en la mañana. Desde allí cruzaré los Pirineos para llegar a Roncesvalles, y desde allí seguir el llamado Camino Francés, rumbo a Santiago, Finisterra y finalmente Muxia.Más adelante les compartiré otras novedades y avances de este camino que esta a punto de iniciar.------------------------July 26th7 DAYS TO GO
Gigantic greeting to all, and again, thank you…
thank you for blowing into the wind, so a couple of wings can rise up and let
big dreams fly on, whilst a couple feet walk through extraordinary venues and
the mind creates fantastic words to recreate pages with adventures.
This adventure keeps shaping up, and the way begins
grabbing you, you let yourself be taken, and your mind sets itself up to the
idea. I have recently understood that my way must be rethought of, and I am to
take my first steps in France, where the original way actually begins. It’s
going to be a few more kilometers, and one or two more days, but a trail that
was formerly shared also by Charlemagne, Saint Francis of Assisi, Paulo Cohelo,
and many more, is now open for me to be part of it as well. I will begin at the
town of Saint Jean Pied du Port, in France, on August 2nd early in
the morning, crossing the Pyrenees to reach Roncesvalles and continue on the
French Way, to Santiago, Finisterra and finally Muxia.
During the upcoming days I will be sharing more
updates on this adventure that is about to begin.----------------------------------------Julio 19PRIMER FASE COMPLETADA!!! :):):)WWWOOWWWW GENTEEEESSSS!!!!!

West Coast of United States where I believe there is a high 
concentration of sustainability initiatives imbued with spiritual

to heal and unleash my creative potential in service of my authentic 
life calling – to serve the Great Transition – as well as to seek, find 
and learn from individuals, spiritual teachers, projects and initiatives
 that are creating the ecological, economical, social and spiritual 
solutions and healing practices we need in the world today. As I 
journey, I will capture my learnings, insights, inspirations on my 
website both in English and Turkish, with prose, poetry, photographs and
 videos. I will document the teachings, innovation, newness, courage, 
inspiration…</p>

NEW WORLD

what is this all about?


I will be setting on a 3-month learning journey to the 
West Coast of United States where I believe there is a high 
concentration of sustainability initiatives imbued with spiritual 
practices, highly progressive communities and spiritual 
(r)evolutionaries. As I dive into this learning journey, my purpose is 
to heal and unleash my creative potential in service of my authentic 
life calling – to serve the Great Transition – as well as to seek, find 
and learn from individuals, spiritual teachers, projects and initiatives
 that are creating the ecological, economical, social and spiritual 
solutions and healing practices we need in the world today. As I 
journey, I will capture my learnings, insights, inspirations on my 
website both in English and Turkish, with prose, poetry, photographs and
 videos. I will document the teachings, innovation, newness, courage, 
inspiration…

All I’ll have with myself is a backpack, a computer and a camera.

And of course my questions, my curiosity, my passion for
 transition stories, evolution and possibility. I will ask these three 
questions to everyone I will on my journey:



what do you see happening in the world right now?


how do we become more resilient as individuals and communities as we enter a new era?


what role do you play and who do you see yourself 
becoming in the Great Transition and the creation of an ecologically 
sustainable, spiritually fulfilling and socially just human presence on 
Earth?




The
uniqueness of this story is that it shows how our personal journeys
and evolution towards wholeness and authentic life is woven together
with the unfolding story of humanity at this time. The story of one
woman's seeking and meaning making for her own life  becomes the
inspiring story of thousands who are healing & co-creating
themselves and the world at the same time. 

why ""Brave New World""? Because to create a new world, we
 need a new storyline, we need to believe that it is possible and that 
it is already happening. By connecting individual and community stories 
of transformation, healing and resilience, we will strengthen the 
possibility of co-creating the world we dream of NOW. 
What
is going on in the World right now has never occurred in human
history before. As we complete an era of industrialized, dualistic,
ego-based human systems, there seems to be a lot of chaos,
destruction and crises out there – from earthquakes to economic
collapse, from climate change to social unrest – we seem to be in
the middle of a big transition both as humanity and the planet.  


But
is this all there is to this Story? 


The
crisis is an opportunity, a wake-up call, an invitation for us to
evolve to higher ground. At some point in the evolution process of
humanity, we separates ourselves from the rest of Nature, from the
natural cycles of Life which created the consequences that we are
facing in the form of ecological, economical, social and spiritual
crisis right now. This is driving humanity towards creating an
ecologically sustainable, spiritually fulfilling and socially just
human presence on the planet.
How
do we shift from a culture & mindset rooted in consumption, greed
and control to a culture based on the principles of well-being and
sustainability for all of Life?
How do we live authentic lives, doing what we love and putting our gifts into service of life?

This
is the greatest story of transition, humanity coming of age in human
history. It is the end of the World as we know it and it is the birth
of a new reality woven stitch by stitch with the creativity,
generosity, compassion and the genius of committed individuals and
communities working in solidarity, willing to think and act in a
whole new way.
The
Shift is already happening and the World needs to know that. 


From
our individual journeys to our communities' transformation to the
planetary shift to the great cycles of Cosmos, we are part of the one
Great Story. In the web of Life, everything is connected and related.
There is an invitation to tell this amazing story. 


The
story of the Great Transition and the Birth of a new Humanity.

A
leap into the Brave New World.

how will the money be used and why crowdfunding?
The project budget is much bigger than my crowdfunding goal here. Parallel to my crowdfunding efforts, I will be looking for sponsorship from individuals and organizations who are aligned with my values and the vision of the world I am co-creating with other visionaries. The money for the project will be used mostly for traveling (on land where possible), food, some extra photo equipment (I already have the basics but I need some accessories for the mobility), participation fees of the conferences and workshops I want to attend and document...I believe crowdfunding is the most exciting and sweet way of participatory community financing...what better way of co-funding something  that intends to serve the whole, the community, Life itself!

<p>Des interprétations de la mythologie des sumériens, des babyloniens et des écrits hébraïques, dont la Bible, laissent supposer qu’avant Ève, Dieu aurait créé une femme nommée Lilith.

Offusqué, Adam s’en serait plaint à Dieu qui aurait exigé de Lilith qu’elle se soumettre à son compagnon. Trop fière et indépendante, Lilith n’y aurait pas consenti et aurait quitté le Paradis pour l’Enfer en emportant avec elle la potentialité de faire diverger le dessein de l’humanité. Car que serait le monde d’aujourd’hui si notre vision de la nature primaire de la femelle humaine était celle d’une femme maîtresse de sa destinée et de sa sexualité, possédant de surcroît un statut égal à celui de l’homme ? C’est sur ce postulat que repose <em>La première femme d’Adam</em>, qui commence là où les textes Saints s’arrêtent.

SYNOPSIS
Des interprétations de la mythologie des sumériens, des babyloniens et des écrits hébraïques, dont la Bible, laissent supposer qu’avant Ève, Dieu aurait créé une femme nommée Lilith. Cette dernière, formée d’argile comme son homologue masculin, et par ce fait même, croyant bénéficier d’un statut égal à ce dernier, aurait désiré se placer sur l'homme lors du coït afin d’augmenter son plaisir. Offusqué, Adam s’en serait plaint à Dieu qui aurait exigé de Lilith qu’elle se soumettre à son compagnon. Trop fière et indépendante, Lilith n’y aurait pas consenti et aurait quitté le Paradis pour l’Enfer en emportant avec elle la potentialité de faire diverger le dessein de l’humanité. Car que serait le monde d’aujourd’hui si notre vision de la nature primaire de la femelle humaine était celle d’une femme maîtresse de sa destinée et de sa sexualité, possédant de surcroît un statut égal à celui de l’homme ? C’est sur ce postulat que repose La première femme d’Adam, qui commence là où les textes Saints s’arrêtent. Cette histoire raconte la traversée fictive de Lilith à travers l’Enfer pour regagner sa place au Paradis suite à sa rencontre avec un serpent nommé Igor qui la convainc que cette dernière représente définitivement mieux la femme moderne qu’Ève l’a fait en lui succédant.

One of the reasons RECESS SHON is so special is that the readers will have a chance to view LIVE-ACTION episodes online which are called WEBISODES.  In the book there will be unsolved mysteries for which the  kids will create their own story lines.  Kids all across the world will participate and the most CREATIVE concept and/or the BEST story will win a chance to see their idea reenacted in live action.  The footage will THEN be uploaded to the RECESS SHON FAN PAGE with the winner receiving full credit.

<p><strong>Mental Health Theme:</strong></p>
<p>The central struggle in the novel is between the main character and his mental health, an important dialogue for all of us to have. I'm opening up my novel for you to share a thought, experience, or epiphany about mental health and support a great local organization, <a href=""http://www.mitchbourbonniere.com/opk.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OPK</a> (Ogijiita Pimatiswin Kinamatwin). I will provide 50% of all profit earned on sales for the 2 years of publication to Action Therapy, a local organization run by a great champion of health and wellness- Mitch Bourbonniere. I had the pleasure of working with Mitch in a practicum placement, I can say that this man cares deeply about the health of his community and the people he supports.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>While pursuing a Masters in Counselling Psychology I found myself taken by the works of Irving Yalom, William Glasser, Viktor Frankl and James Bugental. Particularly the way Irving Yalom would use fiction as a way to explore concepts in mental health and psychotherapy. Happiness is Just a Pill Away is a story that formed as a fun side project while growing my understanding of psychotherapy and sidestepping the responsibilities of a being grad student. </p>
<p>The novel became a way for me to visualize concepts and dialogue in counselling that resonated with me, specifically ideas surrounding anxiety and meaning in existential psychotherapy. In a funny and exaggerated way, this novel also explores many thoughts I've had about everything from work, relationships, and fluorescent lights through satirical internal dialogue. Written in the first-person perspective, I hope you will become the character and connect with the feelings and thoughts expressed in the story. In the end, I hope the story helps you reframe and manage the your daily experience.</p>
<p><strong>What makes this novel stand out:</strong></p>
<p>I had a few goals when I wrote this story. I wanted it to feel very real, so it is not a wild story about sex, drugs, murder or any of those popular tropes readily available in most movies, shows and books. Instead, I chose to explore an existential crisis that may feel all too familiar for many of us.</p>
<p>The writing style may also stand out. The whole novel takes place in the thoughts and from perspective of the main character. Nothing happens that isn't thought, viewed, or heard through by the main character. I tried to weave a story that pulled you (as the reader) in, letting you become the main character and fully immerse yourself in the fictional world. My initial intent was to create an androgynous character that anyone could identify with, though that didn't work out well in practice...</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the challenge I face is funding the publishing process. With the money raised I will have an opportunity to work with a professional editor to polish the final product, receive support from a design team for cover/layout/ebook formatting, and get connected to a distribution network.</p>
<p>My biggest hope is that the story resonates with readers, sparks meaningful introspection, and provides some laughs along the way. It is always a risk to put yourself out there, and writing a story is perhaps one of the most vulnerable processes to go through. </p>
<p>Thank you for considering supporting my project!</p>

I wanted it to feel very real, so it is not a wild story about sex, drugs, murder or any of those popular tropes readily available in most movies, shows and books. Instead, I chose to explore an existential crisis that may feel all too familiar for many of us.
The writing style may also stand out. The whole novel takes place in the thoughts and from perspective of the main character. Nothing happens that isn't thought, viewed, or heard through by the main character. I tried to weave a story that pulled you (as the reader) in, letting you become the main character and fully immerse yourself in the fictional world. My initial intent was to create an androgynous character that anyone could identify with, though that didn't work out well in practice...
Risks and challenges
Currently, the challenge I face is funding the publishing process. With the money raised I will have an opportunity to work with a professional editor to polish the final product, receive support from a design team for cover/layout/ebook formatting, and get connected to a distribution network.
My biggest hope is that the story resonates with readers, sparks meaningful introspection, and provides some laughs along the way. It is always a risk to put yourself out there, and writing a story is perhaps one of the most vulnerable processes to go through.

<h3>Story of my book</h3>
<p><i>The Anxiety Advantage</i> is an unapologetic perspective on anxiety and more importantly a how to guide on how to manage anxiety as a “Gen Zer” (anyone born between 1995 and 2019) in today's world. Through authentic storytelling paired with scholarly research, The Anxiety Advantage comes together to illustrate how understanding your anxiety can become your biggest superpower.</p>My name is Wes Woodson and I am the author of The Anxiety Advantage. I wrote this book because I learned that my generation, Generation Z, is the most anxious and depressed generation in history. And after years of struggling with anxiety in silence, I wanted to understand why my generation was so anxious. More specifically, after experiencing the biggest panic attack of my life, going through therapy, and being admitted into a mental health program, I wanted to share all of the tricks I learned as to how to go about managing your anxiety in a better way.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to better manage your anxiety by understanding it better. It is my belief that when we understand the things that makes us anxious and how and why they make us anxious, we gain the biggest advantage over our anxiety. In this book I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for managing anxiety. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand your anxiety.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn the reason behind Generation Z's anxiety and the six principles we can adapt in our daily lives to better manage our anxiety. You'll hear stories like:<p>A young man who was admitted into a mental health institution, but has now managed his anxiety through exercise and keeping a healthy diet.</p>
<ul>
<li>A young woman who hated public speaking, but found an interesting trick to calm her nerves before taking the stage.</li>
<li>My personal battle with anxiety and depression and how I have fought to be here today.</li>
<li>You will love this book if you are interested in learning more about anxiety, reading personal stories about those who have anxiety, and learning more about self-improvement.</li>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p> Tia Hudson is in her third year of studying English and American Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London, and works part-time as an estate agent. She became interested in the feminist movement in 2017 and is now a firm supporter of female advancement within western culture.<br/><br/>The motive behind writing this book stems from the influence of strong women in tabloid culture along with the need to encourage young girls to strive for greatness. Tia has described Meghan, Duchess of Sussex as one of her biggest role models. Seeing her incredible work in the field of feminist advocacy allowed Tia to see the role that every girl must play in bringing more awareness to this cause, and creating more harmony in the world. This is what prompted the subject of empowerment and positivity in her book, which she hopes will go on to inspire the minds of many young women, in the way that Meghan has inspired her.<br/><br/>Tia has always had a strong love for writing and has viewed the process of creating this book as a true labour of love, as it combines female advancement and the power of positivity, two concepts that she is deeply passionate about. She has a love for dogs, high-fashion and holistic health and wellness and one day hopes to establish a career in publishing (and run the world as a side hobby!)<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Tia at tnhudson@hotmail.co.uk and through her various Social Media platforms:<br/>Instagram: @_tiahudson<br/>Facebook: Tia Hudson<br/>LinkedIn: Tia Hudson<br/>Twitter: @tia.hudson27<br/><br/> <p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

About the Author Tia Hudson is in her third year of studying English and American Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London, and works part-time as an estate agent. She became interested in the feminist movement in 2017 and is now a firm supporter of female advancement within western culture.The motive behind writing this book stems from the influence of strong women in tabloid culture along with the need to encourage young girls to strive for greatness. Tia has described Meghan, Duchess of Sussex as one of her biggest role models. Seeing her incredible work in the field of feminist advocacy allowed Tia to see the role that every girl must play in bringing more awareness to this cause, and creating more harmony in the world. This is what prompted the subject of empowerment and positivity in her book, which she hopes will go on to inspire the minds of many young women, in the way that Meghan has inspired her.Tia has always had a strong love for writing and has viewed the process of creating this book as a true labour of love, as it combines female advancement and the power of positivity, two concepts that she is deeply passionate about. She has a love for dogs, high-fashion and holistic health and wellness and one day hopes to establish a career in publishing (and run the world as a side hobby!)For more information you can connect with Tia at tnhudson@hotmail.co.uk and through her various Social Media platforms:Instagram: @_tiahudsonFacebook: Tia HudsonLinkedIn: Tia HudsonTwitter: @tia.hudson27 Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

learn how the Holy Spirit can change your life through the fruits of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control;
explore the fruits of the Spirit through real-life stories, examples from the Old and New Testaments, and the wisdom of the Church;
examine how you are cultivating the fruits of the Spirit in your own life.
 “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control,” St. Paul wrote to the Galatians. “If we live by the Spirit, let us also be guided by the Spirit” (Galatians 5:22–23, 25). Those words are just as relevant and powerful for you today as they were for the Galatians. In Invite the Holy Spirit into Your Life, Deanna G. Bartalini draws on her own story, sacred Scripture, the lives of the saints, and the wisdom of the Church to explore how to grow in each of the fruits of the Spirit. You can record your own insights right in the journal, then bring those thoughts to your small faith-sharing group for further discussion. And as with all the Stay Connected journals, guided prayers and space to journal your own prayer helps you forge a deeper, living connection with Jesus. Deanna G. Bartalini, M.Ed.; M.P.A., is a Catholic writer, speaker, presenter, and educator. She and her husband, Deacon John Bartalini, have two married children. Deanna loves teaching about Catholicism and how it fits into our daily lives. She writes at DeannaBartalini.com and contributes to CatholicMom.com, AmazingCatechists.com, and NewEvangelizers.com. She also contributed to A Catholic Mom's Prayer Companion, published by Ave Maria Press.",4.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are publishing this book in both Spanish and English, which creates a bigger impact than English alone. This book will connect with Moms and Dads of both languages and help us connect all our children to language and reading.  </p>
<p>The University of Arizona also says that a ""benefit of bilingual books is that they can be shared in families where the parents may speak only one language while the child is learning English as a second language. Children who speak only English can learn about different languages and can pick up words in other languages by reading bilingual books.""</p>
<p>This story is also important too as a heart warming connection with family.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

The Impact
We are publishing this book in both Spanish and English, which creates a bigger impact than English alone. This book will connect with Moms and Dads of both languages and help us connect all our children to language and reading.  
The University of Arizona also says that a ""benefit of bilingual books is that they can be shared in families where the parents may speak only one language while the child is learning English as a second language. Children who speak only English can learn about different languages and can pick up words in other languages by reading bilingual books.""
This story is also important too as a heart warming connection with family.

Risks & Challenges
There are a few risks, but I know that as a team (myself, Alexa, Sonja, and Casey) we can overcome these risks and get you a beautifully finished book. 
Plot Duckies has fronted the first payment to Alexa so she can get to work and they've published many times before, so I know this book will happen.

<h3>Story of <i>Unglamored</i>
</h3>
<p><i>Unglamored</i> is about a Chinese-American singer who struggles secretly with an eating disorder in an industry that demands perfection and glorifies thinness.</p>
<p>My name is Jessie Cheng, and I am the author of <i>Unglamored</i>, a Young Adult novel. I wrote this novel to shine light on mental health, especially eating disorders, within the entertainment industry and to create an emotional connection between us and those in the public eye.</p>
<p>In reading this novel, my hope is that you will discover the strength and freedom that vulnerability brings. Though fictional, many of this story’s scenes and interactions reflect true, ongoing experiences. I’m excited for you to meet my protagonist, and, by extension, me.<br/><br/>75% of all proceeds above my campaign goal  ($6,000 for a hardcover book) will be donated to Project Heal &amp; Asian Mental Health Collective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project Heal: an organization dedicated to eliminating financial &amp; social barriers to eating disorder treatment, especially within minority/marginalized communities</li>
<li>Asian Mental Health Collective: an organization that actively addresses hate crimes against Asians/Asian-Americans and provides reduced-fee therapy &amp; support to the Asian community</li>
</ul>
<p>Customized sticker packs and bookmarks are designed by Madeline, the owner of Notebeans Stationery (@notebeansstationery). 70% of all Notebeans Stationery profits are donated to Global Giving. </p>
<p>Nineteen-year-old Rose B.D. is the nation’s top star, a famous Chinese-American singer who appears to have it all: a large fan base, a glamorous career in Shanghai, the perfect body. But behind the camera is a girl the public does not recognize, a girl who fights daily with the monsters in her head. Join Rose B.D. as she navigates the pressures of celebrity life, experiencing love, friendship, betrayal, and everything in between.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are passionate about mental health and music, enjoy romance novels, and want to meet characters undergoing relatable experiences. Ultimately, I hope that <i>Unglamored</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I experience healing through vulnerability and authenticity?</li>
<li>How does society promote the thinness ideal and affect one’s mental health?</li>
<li>Why is mental health neglect the norm for those in the public eye?</li>
</ul>
<div><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing mental health, eating disorders, and authenticity will change us all for the better. </p></div>

<h3>What Is ""Bye Bye, Billionaires""?</h3>
<p><strong>Bye Bye Billionaires</strong> is an illustrated book about capitalism, and what's wrong with capitalism. It is written in plain language so readers of any age or background can understand it.<br/><br/>In the book, readers learn about the tremendous <strong>wealth inequality</strong> in the world, and how it came to be. Understand <strong>capital</strong>, <strong>profit</strong>, <strong>labor</strong> and <strong>exploitation</strong>, the <strong>free market</strong>, <strong>the attention economy</strong>, and <strong>disaster capitalism </strong>. Understand how capitalism isn't the only way to do business, or to live, and learn about some alternatives.<br/><br/><strong>Bye Bye Billionaires </strong>is written and illustrated by Heydon Pickering, a designer and technical writer. Heydon studied art, and his reading critical theory and semiotics informed his work. Since then he became a designer and coder for the web, specializing in web accessibility: making web interfaces usable for people with disabilities.</p>
<h3>What Needs Funding?</h3>
<p><strong>Bye Bye Billionaires</strong> is intended as a print book. I want it to be a high quality production: full color, perfect binding, heavy grade paper. Funding will pay for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing and proof-reading using a professional editor</li>
<li>Purchase of ISBN number</li>
<li>Formatting and submission to a print-on-demand service (including ebook production where available)</li>
<li>Multiple bulk print runs (100 books is approximately £500) for sale, as well as gifting to book clubs, schools, libraries, etc.</li>
<li>Creation of stickers, and other promotional materials and gifts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>There are two kinds of information around capitalism:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Misleading information</strong>, typically stemming from those who benefit from capitalism (capitalists!) and their spokespeople</li>
<li>
<strong>Overcomplex information</strong>, which is aimed at adults versed in philosophy, critical theory, or the nitty gritty of economic theories</li>
</ul>
<p>Capitalism, and the problems with it, are actually fairly easy to grasp. So are the alternatives to capitalism. I wanted to put all of this in one, easy to digest book. <strong>Bye Bye Billionaires </strong>is designed to help you, your friends, and your kids be questioning and critical about the world we live in, and one of the biggest parts of how it works (or doesn't work!).</p>
<h3>How else can I help?</h3>
<p>Aside from funding, it would be great if you could help get the word out. I am also available for interviews/podcast episodes if you think it's something your audience would like to hear about.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>An Artfully Made Book<br/>
</h3>There are many books out there on working with your dreams.  What makes my book unique is that it is made by a visual artist.  Besides being lavishly illustrated, it is a heavily designed book, made to look like a 17th century alchemical folio.  <b><i>Oneirognosis</i></b> is also written in an ""antique"" 19th century voice. This book was born out of an earlier project, Antarctica Dream-Dollars, and is written in the voices of two of the characters in the story. Filled with poetry and lyrical prose, this is a deep dive into an exploration not only of dreams, but of perception, reality, and the spiritual and material world.  Plus, I have researched symbolism and iconography for several decades, and I incorporate that knowledge into both the text and illustrations.  A lifelong artist, my work has been in over 70 exhibitions in galleries and museums around the world, and is in private collections in fifty countries.  <br/><br/>Here's a sample page.  More page images and illustrations are found in the Gallery above.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1119436/files/20141227185631-SisterQuote.jpg?1419735391"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><b><i>Oneirognosis</i></b>, a Greek word for ""dream knowledge.""   The book will be around 6 x 6"" square, hardbound, with a simple, black hard cover with silver foil stamp.  There are 120 pages and 25 illustrations, four of which are on this page.  The typefaces are a combination of several antique and distressed fonts.  <i><b>Oneirognosis</b> </i>will be beautiful to look at and densely packed with iconography, symbolism and wisdom.  Be sure to check out the Gallery above for more images of illustrations and page layouts.<br/><br/>This is my second book.  My first book, called <b><i>Capital Offenses</i> </b>was a book of political satire.  It is a very different subject, but it shows that I can complete projects like this and get them out into the world.  Additionally, <b><i>Capital Offenses</i></b> was named one of the <b>Best Books of 2014 by Publishers Weekly,</b> showing that I am a good author, designer and publisher.  Please help me to make a bigger splash with this book!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1062857/files/20141201184700-Dreaming.jpg?1417488420"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h3>Down to Business</h3>
<p><b><i>Oneirognosis</i></b> is completely written, illustrated, and laid-out.  I am just putting the final touches on it.  The book will be 
ready to send to the printer as soon as this funding campaign is 
finished.<br/><br/>The basic financial goal is to get 250 hardbound books 
printed and shipped from my printer in Canada.  If I go over my goal, 
that money will help with placing ads and promoting the book.  The 
printing costs are low enough for me to sell it wholesale in stores, so I
 will be seeking distribution and in-store placement, which is key to a 
successful book.  The more money I raise, the more books I can print, 
and the better I can promote it!</p>

I was born August 12th in 1970 to Eric and Irene, and until 2007 I had stayed in Newmilns (in my constituency) my whole life. Since then, I’ve lived a bit further afield – in Galston, just three miles down the road.An SNP voter all my life, and a member since the 90’s, I could not be more proud of the route my party has taken in the last few years.I was elected as a councillor in the May 2007 elections which brought about the area’s first SNP-led council and the area’s first SNP MSP in Willie Coffey.Since my election, I have served on numerous committees and was the Spokesperson for Planning in my first term, and have since been moved into the Cabinet on this term. It is having this considerable wealth of political experience at a relatively young age that makes me a good candidate for the area.

<h3>What's Missing from this Picture?</h3>
<p>Y-O-U!</p>
<p>At Eastern Point Lit House the goal is to have fun with words--writing them &amp; reading them. Our table is open to anyone who is working with words and needs a quiet space to get them from brain to page. We call ourselves a ""Book Incubator"" and use of the space for writing is absolutely <b>FREE.</b></p>
<p>Eastern Point Lit House also</p>
<ul>
<li>hosts readings, workshops, &amp; performances</li>
<li>is a space for community gatherings</li>
<li>offers editorial services, critiques, and mentoring</li>
<li>offers a unique selection of small press and used books, and </li>
<li>sells some essential word nerd supplies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eastern Point Lit House is what we like to call a full-service literary center located on beautiful Cape Ann, in the storied town of Gloucester, Massachusetts. Since opening a little over two years ago we’ve hosted poetry and prose readings by local and nationally recognized authors, writing workshops, storytelling events for children, and much more, including the Lit House Book Club which takes place at Duckworth’s Bistrot. We even give away good books to kids who want them—for free. How cool is that? Our mission is simply: Fun with Words. So far we’ve been doing just that.</p>
<p>We started this odd literary project from the ground up—no bank loans, just the little cash we had in our pockets and a lot of generous contributions of time and elbow grease from our community. And it’s been great—we’ve helped many writers develop, write, and edit their books, we’ve given poets a venue to let their voices be heard, and we’ve generally elevated the literary conversation here in this beautiful place. Right now The Lit House as a sole proprietorship, with only me at the helm, with a ton of help from Jenn Monroe, and a lot of volunteerism from the people of Gloucester and beyond. But we’re bumping up against the need to grow, and this is where you come in.</p>
<p>Eastern Point Lit House is launching its first ever fundraising campaign to help us take this project to the next level. Here’s what we hope to do with the money:</p>
</div><div>
<h3>It's time to grow! </h3>
<p>We want to help foster the growth of the literary arts on Cape Ann. We put pretty much every spare penny we had into getting the doors open, the walls, painted, the shelves filled. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funds raised in this campaign will go towards keeping our doors open and the lights (and WiFi) on, no matter if we reach our goal or not. It will also help us to spread the word through advertising and other promotional materials. We plan to join arts groups on Cape Ann (seARTS, Cape Ann Television, etc.) to help spread the good words. </li>
<li>Re-start our press. When we opened shop, we published a few chapbooks under the Lit House Press name. But printing is expensive, and while also opening a physical shop it became impossible to continue with that model. That said, we’d like to bring the printing process here, in-house. We hope to purchase new printing equipment, card stock and fine paper, paper cutting gear, and software that will allow us to do small print runs, many featuring local writers and artists. Each small run will be handcrafted—so bookmaking would also become part of our mission.</li>
<li>Make the shift from sole proprietor to a not for profit model, allowing us to access grants and donations. I’m told about once a week that we’re really acting like a non-profit, so the time has come to make that change. But I’ll need help, and from what I hear it’s not exactly cheap to do this. Your contribution would help make this happen.</li>
<li>Bring in some help. While I have been very lucky to have generous volunteers, this can only take us so far. Our long-term goal is to bring on someone at least part time to help us develop our educational programming, which is something we really want to grow.</li>
<li>Bring us piece of mind. It would be great to get a little ahead on our rent so that we can concentrate on programming. Everything over our initial, modest goal of $7,500 would do just that.</li>
<li><p>The future is wide open for The Lit House. Long term, we’d like to see an annual literary festival of some sort take place on Cape Ann. And we’ve got many more ideas we think you’ll be excited about.</p></li>
<li>When you choose to support us, we will show our sincere gratitude through perks such as our one-of-a-kind Lit House t-shirts,  ""Word Nerd"" &amp; ""Write by the Sea"" mugs, copies of the Gloucester Haiku Project, tickets to our Book Club events, writing workshops, and more.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>We are dedicated to the idea of <i>FREE</i>
</h3>
<p>We are writers ourselves and our Book Incubator comes very much from our own desire for the right place to get the words down. Often that is not our homes or the local coffee shop.</p>
<p>We also know that a special creative energy is generated when two or more writers are working in the same space.</p>
<p>We want to give this gift to writers living on and visiting Cape Ann. Create your own retreat at the Lit House. Write by the sea! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Happens after this campaign?</h3>
<p>We know that this campaign will only help us in the short-term. Our long-term plan is to increase our educational programming to support the Book Incubator and our free events. Some examples of these programs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unique writing workshops &amp; classes for all ages</li>
<li>Authors' Nights</li>
<li>Themed gatherings and readings</li>
<li>Editorial services, with discounts for veterans and people in need of financial assistance</li>
<li>Using our revitalized small press to share local stories and poetry, sometimes for free</li>
<li>Work toward making Cape Ann a literary scene to be reckoned with </li>
</ul>
<p>We also plan to make our space available for a very reasonable price to community groups looking for a place to meet.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Don't worry if you can't contribute</h3>
<p>We know most of you are like us--trying to make a living with very little to spare. You can support us by sharing our mission and our story. Use your voice. Use your computer. Use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you! </strong></p>
<p>So this is the big ask: Can you help? We’ve got some tasty gifts for those of you willing to help. Check those out on our fundraising page. And thank you. We can’t do this without you. You have my unending gratitude.</p>

<div>I grew up in Northern Ireland listening to pop music on pirate radio stations. I'm not a musician, just a fan. In the 80s, I managed Aussie Christian hard rock band ROSANNA'S RAIDERS and organised concerts in Melbourne, Australia for groups such as Stryper, Petra and Whitecross as well as for artists like Larry Norman, Randy Stonehill and Bruce Cockburn. Recently I've been working with Steve Rowe's bands Mortification and Wonrowe Vision. In 2012, I wrote and published <i>Rosanna--</i>-<i>rock'n'roll believer</i>, a biography of vocalist/guitarist Rosanna Palmer.</div>
<div><b>Why write <i>Metal Missionary</i>?</b></div>
<div>I believe that Steve Rowe's story is one that needs to be told.  He and I have spent almost 12 months shaping his life story from childhood to today.  In over 65,000 words and scores of photos, we explain how his life evolved from that of a healthy suburban Aussie boy to that of a cancer survivor classified as an L1 paraplegic.  Along the way from adolescence to adulthood, Steve not only fought cancer, he also created extreme Gospel/Christian metal music releasing 15 albums, various musicvideos and DVDs as well as touring the world with his band Mortification.</div>
<div>
<i><b>Metal Missionary:  The Steve Rowe Story </b></i>will impact many readers throughout the world.  Not just 'metalheads', but anyone interested in a moving, emotional, inspirational story of gritty determination and unswerving dedication to  a cause.</div>
<div><b>Why run a fundraising campaign?</b></div>
<div>We don't expect to make much, if any, money from publishing and selling a hardback book.  However, any contributions to our indiegogo campaign will help us finance the design, layout and publication of Steve's story.</div>
<div> We need at least $25,000 to create 1,000 books. This money will pay for the design/layout artist, scans of archival photos, all pre-press work and printing.</div>
<div><b>What can supporters get?</b></div>
<div>Perks for contributors include Mortification and Wonrowe Vision CDs, a CD/DVD package, iBook versions of <b><i>Metal Missionary</i></b> and my book about Rosanna, a hardback copy of <i><b>Metal Missionary</b></i>, a Skype session with Steve Rowe and special Mortification merch including t-shirts from Steve's stash in his home office.</div>
<div>If we don't reach our goal, any money raised will go towards creating sample pages to present to potential publishers.</div>
<div>I know how hard it is to fundraise for projects, having been part of a successful crowdfunding effort for a documentary film on the life of God's Squad CMC founder John Smith.</div>
<div>Not everyone is a metal music fan; not everyone is enamoured of the Christian faith. But I hope that enough people will be interested in reading Steve's remarkable story of survival and how he has spent a lifetime overcoming incredible obstacles while attempting to shine a positive light into what is generally a dark and disturbing subculture.</div>
<div>I trust that, if you can't contribute financially, you will help us spread the word about our indiegogo campaign and assist us in enlisting the support of as many people as possible.                                        ---<b>Vic Campbell</b>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<i>Lost In Interpretation</i> is a book about Chinese culture, told by someone who is actually Chinese. While many people can learn to speak Cantonese and Mandarin or study the culture in school, no amount of outside knowledge can contest with being raised in the Chinese culture. This book, based on real stories and events, helps readers gain useful insight into the Chinese culture, US-China relations, Chinese food, language, identities Chinese Americans struggle with, relationships, customs and taboos which many Americans may have found intriguing and fascinating!<br/><br/>My name is Barbara Hong Li and I am the author of <i>Lost In Interpretation</i>. I decided to write this book after I learned of the horrendous murder of Xinran Ji, a USC graduate student from China who was beaten to death with a baseball bat by four teenagers on July 14th, 2014. The surveillance video later showed Ji staggering back to his own fourth floor apartment and eventually dying in his own bed. Although Ji had his cellphone and laptop with him the whole time and a roommate in the next room, he never called for help. The teenagers later admitted that they assumed he had money, simply because he was Chinese. <br/><br/>Asian Americans are seen as the Model Minority and because of that, they aren't as willing to seek outside help. My own experience of living in the US for the past twenty years has taught me that the understanding many Americans have of China has been shockingly limited. I am writing this book to shatter the misunderstandings, misperceptions, and miscommunications between the two cultures in an effort to reduce the hate crimes against Asian Americans. It is time to demystify the Chinese culture. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that while the American stereotype of the Chinese seems to be one of secrecy and overall rudeness, the truth is that the Chinese and American cultures are actually more similar than one may believe. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for Chinese culture. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the Chinese culture and people in a fresh new perspective and gain useful insights into the culture that can be be helpful to you either within work settings or on a personal level. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn such things as the Chinese views of marriage, the wrong things to say and do in the Chinese culture, the Chinese way of educating the younger generation to achieve success, the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese, and eight different styles of Chinese cuisines. You'll hear stories such as:<p>Jingjing, who was a 31-year-old woman with a successful career, but was labeled as a “leftover girl” by her friends and family in China who pressured her into marrying someone almost twice her age. </p>
<p>Mr. Wong, who stabbed his new wife from China with a pair of scissors when she was in the shower simply because he thought she was making him “wear a green hat,” a figurative way of saying she was cheating on him.</p>
<p>A newly-wedded Chinese wife who arrived in her husband’s house in America ready to assume the role of a housewife, but was viewed as not sexual enough. </p>You will love this book if you want to learn more about China from the source, instead of reading yet another second-hand account. <i>Lost in Interpretation</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to American readers while staying true to what it means to be Chinese.<br/> <h3>The Book - <i>Lost in Interpretation</i>
</h3>
<p><br/><strong>The book is written in three parts.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the Introduction + Chapters 1 - 3. In Part 1, readers will learn how we got here today in terms of US-China relations and the different lenses through which both cultures see the same events. For example, I discuss how many Americans see President Nixon as a criminal and only remember his time in office as scandalous, whereas the Chinese people view him as “the old friend of the Chinese people” and credit him with opening the door to modern US-China relations. Readers will also learn how Chinese Americans, being caught in two different cultures, struggle to find their own identities and their frustration about the difficulties of integrating into mainstream American society. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4 - 16. These start with Hofstede’s six cultural dimensions and the similarities and differences between the Chinese and Americans within them. Readers will learn eight different Chinese cuisines, commonly mispronounced Chinese last names, Chinese family relationships, and the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese. I will also cover Chinese social traditions, such as how we Chinese like to give away “Hong Bao,” which are red envelops containing money. Is that a way the Chinese say “thank you?” or some sort of a bribery? Readers will also learn why dumplings, a favorite for some Americans, are a must-have-item on the dinner table at almost every Chinese festival. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 17 and 18. It talks about taboos in the Chinese culture and consequences if wrong things are said or done in the Chinese culture. For example, readers will hear the story of Mr. Wong, who stabbed his new wife from China with a pair of scissors while she was in the shower simply because she put a green towel under his pillow. Readers will also learn the different views regarding life ceremonies, such as how in the US, a memorial ceremony is oftentimes treated as an opportunity to celebrate life. In China, laughter and brightly colored attire are strictly forbidden as such ceremonies are purely an occasion to mourn.</p>

Lost In Interpretation is a book about Chinese culture, told by someone who is actually Chinese. While many people can learn to speak Cantonese and Mandarin or study the culture in school, no amount of outside knowledge can contest with being raised in the Chinese culture. This book, based on real stories and events, helps readers gain useful insight into the Chinese culture, US-China relations, Chinese food, language, identities Chinese Americans struggle with, relationships, customs and taboos which many Americans may have found intriguing and fascinating!My name is Barbara Hong Li and I am the author of Lost In Interpretation. I decided to write this book after I learned of the horrendous murder of Xinran Ji, a USC graduate student from China who was beaten to death with a baseball bat by four teenagers on July 14th, 2014. The surveillance video later showed Ji staggering back to his own fourth floor apartment and eventually dying in his own bed. Although Ji had his cellphone and laptop with him the whole time and a roommate in the next room, he never called for help. The teenagers later admitted that they assumed he had money, simply because he was Chinese. Asian Americans are seen as the Model Minority and because of that, they aren't as willing to seek outside help. My own experience of living in the US for the past twenty years has taught me that the understanding many Americans have of China has been shockingly limited. I am writing this book to shatter the misunderstandings, misperceptions, and miscommunications between the two cultures in an effort to reduce the hate crimes against Asian Americans. It is time to demystify the Chinese culture. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that while the American stereotype of the Chinese seems to be one of secrecy and overall rudeness, the truth is that the Chinese and American cultures are actually more similar than one may believe. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for Chinese culture. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the Chinese culture and people in a fresh new perspective and gain useful insights into the culture that can be be helpful to you either within work settings or on a personal level. In this book, you'll learn such things as the Chinese views of marriage, the wrong things to say and do in the Chinese culture, the Chinese way of educating the younger generation to achieve success, the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese, and eight different styles of Chinese cuisines. You'll hear stories such as:Jingjing, who was a 31-year-old woman with a successful career, but was labeled as a “leftover girl” by her friends and family in China who pressured her into marrying someone almost twice her age. 
Mr. Wong, who stabbed his new wife from China with a pair of scissors when she was in the shower simply because he thought she was making him “wear a green hat,” a figurative way of saying she was cheating on him.
A newly-wedded Chinese wife who arrived in her husband’s house in America ready to assume the role of a housewife, but was viewed as not sexual enough. You will love this book if you want to learn more about China from the source, instead of reading yet another second-hand account. Lost in Interpretation is a nonfiction book that speaks to American readers while staying true to what it means to be Chinese. The Book - Lost in Interpretation

The book is written in three parts.Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapters 1 - 3. In Part 1, readers will learn how we got here today in terms of US-China relations and the different lenses through which both cultures see the same events. For example, I discuss how many Americans see President Nixon as a criminal and only remember his time in office as scandalous, whereas the Chinese people view him as “the old friend of the Chinese people” and credit him with opening the door to modern US-China relations. Readers will also learn how Chinese Americans, being caught in two different cultures, struggle to find their own identities and their frustration about the difficulties of integrating into mainstream American society. Part 2 contains chapters 4 - 16. These start with Hofstede’s six cultural dimensions and the similarities and differences between the Chinese and Americans within them. Readers will learn eight different Chinese cuisines, commonly mispronounced Chinese last names, Chinese family relationships, and the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese. I will also cover Chinese social traditions, such as how we Chinese like to give away “Hong Bao,” which are red envelops containing money. Is that a way the Chinese say “thank you?” or some sort of a bribery? Readers will also learn why dumplings, a favorite for some Americans, are a must-have-item on the dinner table at almost every Chinese festival. Part 3 contains chapters 17 and 18. It talks about taboos in the Chinese culture and consequences if wrong things are said or done in the Chinese culture. For example, readers will hear the story of Mr. Wong, who stabbed his new wife from China with a pair of scissors while she was in the shower simply because she put a green towel under his pillow. Readers will also learn the different views regarding life ceremonies, such as how in the US, a memorial ceremony is oftentimes treated as an opportunity to celebrate life. In China, laughter and brightly colored attire are strictly forbidden as such ceremonies are purely an occasion to mourn.

<h3>The Novel</h3>
<p>The first draft of <i>The Engineer</i> is complete at 229,000 words - that is about 500 pages in a 6""x 9"" book.  It follows the story of Master Engineer Actaeon Rellios in the ruined futuristic city of Redemption, a shattered remnant of the advanced people known only as the Ancients, strewn with dangerous technology, strange creatures, and unforgiving terrain.</p>
<p><i>In the ruined city, survival is paramount -- politics, war and sustenance rule the minds of most who live there. But Actaeon is different; he is guided by an inquisitive mind and an endless quest for truth. Will these qualities lead him to discover the secrets of Redemption, or will they drive him to the same ruin as the Ancients?</i></p>
<p><i>The Engineer</i> is a multi-faceted story that has a bit of something for everyone: science fiction, fantasy, adventure, action, romance, and intrigue.  </p>
<h3>The Main Cast</h3>
<p><strong>Actaeon: </strong>The Engineer himself; a quirky and eccentric former resident of Shore who has journeyed to Pyramid in order to find better opportunities to study the artifacts and solve the mysteries of Redemption.</p>
<p><strong>Eisandre:</strong> A young woman that serves as a Knight Arbiter of Pyramid, honor-bound to defend the neutrality of Redemption's political center.</p>
<p><strong>Trench:</strong> A mercenary and veteran of the Invasion war, a giant man with a hideous scar across his face.  A brutal fighter that is fiercely loyal to his friends.</p>
<p><strong>Wave:</strong> Trench's charismatic best friend and fellow mercenary and veteran.  Wave is one of the best swordsmen in Redemption, a reputation that allows him to cavort with the nobility.</p>
<p><strong>Gunther:</strong> The Lord Shore, an older and prominent figure in the Raedelle Dominion who wants to see change in what he sees as the ineffective leadership of his people.</p>

<p>Darran M. Handshaw is the author of <i>The Engineer</i> - his first novel.  In addition to writing a book, Darran works as an R&amp;D Engineer for Zebra Technologies where he designs and invents new data capture products and holds more than 10 patents.  In his spare time, Darran is also a firefighter and EMT with his local fire department where he recently completed a two-year term as Captain.  When Darran isn't writing, inventing things, or responding to emergencies, he enjoys his time with his wife, Stefanie, and baby son, Corwin.</p>
<p>Read an interview with Darran here: <a href=""http://www.bit.ly/darraninterview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bit.ly/darraninterview</a></p>
<h3>The Background</h3>
<p><i>The Engineer</i> is an especially important novel to Darran because it tells the true story of how he met his wife in the text-based, role-playing game Redemption.  The first draft of the novel is complete, and so only the final touches are left before the book can be published for all to read. <i> The Engineer</i> will be published whether or not the goals of this campaign are achieved, but if you contribute, you can get cool items like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A signed copy of <i>The Engineer</i>.</li>
<li>The Engineer's bookmark.</li>
<li>Both digital and printed artwork of the cover art and inside map.</li>
<li>
<i>The Engineer</i> eBook.</li>
<li>Recognition in the book as a backer.</li>
<li>You could even help the author name one of the characters!</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also be supporting the project to help fund the final steps in the process to help an author's dream come true.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's Left</h3>
<p>Even though the book has been written, there are quite a few things left to do before it can be published:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover Art must be commissioned and designed for the book.</li>
<li>Final editing must take place for grammar, spelling, and plot consistency.</li>
<li>Final touches must be made to the interior map.</li>
<li>The book must be formatted for print.</li>
<li>The book must be formatted for multiple e-reader formats.</li>
<li>The final edited and formatted story must be published.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>This is where you come in.  With your support, the author will be able to meet the expenses listed below in addition to paying and delivering your backer rewards.  Here's what needs to be done:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cover art will be commissioned from Marcin Rubinkowski, a digital artist whose vision and style matches up nicely with the world of Redemption.  Check out some of his work here:  <a href=""https://marcinrubinkowski.artstation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://marcinrubinkowski.artstation.com/</a><ul><li>Cost: $500</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The book will be formatted for print and e-reader by Streetlight Graphics.  In addition, they will do any final formatting on the cover art for title and back matter.  You can take a look at their website here: <a href=""http://www.streetlightgraphics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.streetlightgraphics.com/</a><ul><li>Cost: $385</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Editing will be completed by the author with help from some of his biggest supporters.  This process will take the longest time of all the things that must be done in order to deliver the best possible story to you, the reader.  Because of this, the book may not be ready for publishing until late summer. <ul><li>Cost: Varies depending on the need for print copies for editors.  Any extra money in this campaign will help fund this effort.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The interior map was made by the author as the concept art for Actaeon's map of Redemption.  Final touches will be made to the map by the author so that it is ready for the interior of the final, finished book.<ul><li>Cost: Time.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>The finished novel will be published using Amazon's Createspace, where Print copies will be available using their Print-on-Demand service and Kindle versions will also be available for the book.  The author also plans on publishing for Nook, Kobo, Apple, Google Play and Smashwords to cover the full variety of e-readers available.<ul><li>Cost: Free + Sale Royalties + Print Costs.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The campaign goal has been set at a reasonable $1,000 to help cover the costs above, in addition to the rewards and editing costs.  Whether or not the goal is met, the plan above will still be completed by the author and any backers will be rewarded once the final work on <i>The Engineer</i> is complete.  If extra money is raised, it will be applied toward advertising the novel to better get the word out.  And, if enough is raised (2-3 thousand more), a professional editor may be hired for the final round of editing to help make the story read even better.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>

<p>A high resolution desktop wallpaper of the original cover art for the book.</p>

<p>You will help the author name a character in the book.  The author will discuss your suggestions with you and do his best to find a way to use a name of your suggestion in some form for one of the characters in the book.  The author will have the final say as to the use of the name as it must match the theme and fit the character well.  There are limited characters that are waiting for your help with a name, so get this one right away before they run out!<br/><br/><i>*All items marked with a (*) will only be shipped within the United States due to high shipping costs for the author to outside countries.  If you live outside of the US, check out the E-Reward Packs!</i></p>
<h3>The Risks</h3>
<p><i>The Engineer</i> will be published regardless of the success of this campaign.  It is a dream of mine to publish a novel and the story has personal meaning to me.  Therefore, you will get your rewards even if the funding goal is not met - though any contribution you make will go a long way toward making this dream come true.</p>
<p>That said, I've set the date for the rewards conservatively as October 2017.  There are many things that can cause a delay in the process, not the least of which being that I've never edited a book before.  I'm shooting for a late summer publishing date, so you may see your rewards even earlier!  I will post any updates to the finalization of <i>The Engineer </i>here, so you will be the first to know (well, second if you count me) how quickly I'm making out and what challenges I run into.</p>
<p>If you have any other questions or concerns, you can feel free to message me on The Engineer's Facebook page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ActaeonRellios/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/ActaeonRellios/</a>  and I'll be sure to get back to you quickly. </p>

Handshaw is the author of The Engineer - his first novel.  In addition to writing a book, Darran works as an R&D Engineer for Zebra Technologies where he designs and invents new data capture products and holds more than 10 patents.  In his spare time, Darran is also a firefighter and EMT with his local fire department where he recently completed a two-year term as Captain.  When Darran isn't writing, inventing things, or responding to emergencies, he enjoys his time with his wife, Stefanie, and baby son, Corwin.

The Background
The Engineer is an especially important novel to Darran because it tells the true story of how he met his wife in the text-based, role-playing game Redemption.  The first draft of the novel is complete, and so only the final touches are left before the book can be published for all to read.  The Engineer will be published whether or not the goals of this campaign are achieved, but if you contribute, you can get cool items like:

A signed copy of The Engineer.
The Engineer's bookmark.
Both digital and printed artwork of the cover art and inside map.

The Engineer eBook.
Recognition in the book as a backer.
You could even help the author name one of the characters!

You will also be supporting the project to help fund the final steps in the process to help an author's dream come true.

What's Left
Even though the book has been written, there are quite a few things left to do before it can be published:

Cover Art must be commissioned and designed for the book.
Final editing must take place for grammar, spelling, and plot consistency.
Final touches must be made to the interior map.
The book must be formatted for print.
The book must be formatted for multiple e-reader formats.
The final edited and formatted story must be published.


The Plan
This is where you come in.  With your support, the author will be able to meet the expenses listed below in addition to paying and delivering your backer rewards.  Here's what needs to be done:

The cover art will be commissioned from Marcin Rubinkowski, a digital artist whose vision and style matches up nicely with the world of Redemption.  Check out some of his work here:  https://marcinrubinkowski.artstation.com/Cost: $500

The book will be formatted for print and e-reader by Streetlight Graphics.  In addition, they will do any final formatting on the cover art for title and back matter.  You can take a look at their website here: http://www.streetlightgraphics.com/Cost: $385

Editing will be completed by the author with help from some of his biggest supporters.  This process will take the longest time of all the things that must be done in order to deliver the best possible story to you, the reader.  Because of this, the book may not be ready for publishing until late summer. Cost: Varies depending on the need for print copies for editors.  Any extra money in this campaign will help fund this effort.

The interior map was made by the author as the concept art for Actaeon's map of Redemption.  Final touches will be made to the map by the author so that it is ready for the interior of the final, finished book.Cost: Time.

The finished novel will be published using Amazon's Createspace, where Print copies will be available using their Print-on-Demand service and Kindle versions will also be available for the book.  The author also plans on publishing for Nook, Kobo, Apple, Google Play and Smashwords to cover the full variety of e-readers available.Cost: Free + Sale Royalties + Print Costs.


The campaign goal has been set at a reasonable $1,000 to help cover the costs above, in addition to the rewards and editing costs.  Whether or not the goal is met, the plan above will still be completed by the author and any backers will be rewarded once the final work on The Engineer is complete.  If extra money is raised, it will be applied toward advertising the novel to better get the word out.  And, if enough is raised (2-3 thousand more), a professional editor may be hired for the final round of editing to help make the story read even better.

The Rewards
The Engineer Desktop Wallpaper: 
A high resolution desktop wallpaper of the original cover art for the book.
Digital Map:
​A digital copy of the interior map of Redemption, hand drawn by Actaeon Rellios himself!
The Engineer eBook for Kindle:
An early release of The Engineer eBook in Kindle format. 
Printed Map 8""x10""*:
A large printed version of Actaeon's map of Redemption for the inside of the book.
The Engineer's Bookmark*:
A bookmark with art from the cover and promotional artwork so you won't lose your place while you read.
Cover Art 11""x14"" print*:
A large print version of the original cover art for The Engineer, suitable for framing or use as a poster.
The Engineer - Signed Copy*:
​An early release version of the printed paperback novel, individually signed by the author.
An in-book Thank You
For major backers of the project, your name will be included inside the book as a thank you for your tremendous support.
Help name a character
You will help the author name a character in the book.  The author will discuss your suggestions with you and do his best to find a way to use a name of your suggestion in some form for one of the characters in the book.  The author will have the final say as to the use of the name as it must match the theme and fit the character well.  There are limited characters that are waiting for your help with a name, so get this one right away before they run out!*All items marked with a (*) will only be shipped within the United States due to high shipping costs for the author to outside countries.  If you live outside of the US, check out the E-Reward Packs!
The Risks
The Engineer will be published regardless of the success of this campaign.  It is a dream of mine to publish a novel and the story has personal meaning to me.  Therefore, you will get your rewards even if the funding goal is not met - though any contribution you make will go a long way toward making this dream come true.
That said, I've set the date for the rewards conservatively as October 2017.  There are many things that can cause a delay in the process, not the least of which being that I've never edited a book before.  I'm shooting for a late summer publishing date, so you may see your rewards even earlier!  I will post any updates to the finalization of The Engineer here, so you will be the first to know (well, second if you count me) how quickly I'm making out and what challenges I run into.
If you have any other questions or concerns, you can feel free to message me on The Engineer's Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/ActaeonRellios/  and I'll be sure to get back to you quickly.

You can have and share The Life By Soul System™ experience as a sponsor of this book project!



Hello!
I'm Grace, and I am the owner, astrologer, numerologist, tarot
reader, and blogger for Life By Soul Intuitive Astrology-Numerology-Tarot based
in San Jose, CA.  You can learn more about my practice, my blogging/writing, and the philosophy behind it all at http://www.lifebysoul.com
The Life By Soul System™ Book has been over 3 years
in the making, and it's finally on a publication track!
The Life By Soul System™ is a unique blending of Western Astrology and Pythagorean Numerology that I have developed over my 20 years of astrology and numerology practitioner experience. It is intended to provide each and all of us with deeper awareness, understanding, acceptance, and respect for ourselves and the people in our lives in ALL areas of our lives - personal/private and professional/public.
These questions and more can finally be answered as they uniquely apply to you:


What is my True life purpose and how do I manifest the lifestyle that supports it?
What is my money-wealth-abundance pattern?

What qualities and characteristics do I really need in a romantic partner?


This first book will provide some fundamental astrology and
numerology basics, descriptions of the combinations that are the cornerstone of
the system, and step-by-step instructions for you to figure out your Life By
Soul base combination and the base combinations of your friends and family.
The Life By Soul System™ is unique because it is the first to actually combine the two practices in a unified form - i.e. Aries 5, Pisces 7, etc.- and to do so with detailed definitions for each of the possible combinations, which the book will provide. The Life By Soul System™ will assist in making both astrological and numerological interpretations easier to do yet also more specific, providing a more in-depth, accurate, and powerful chart interpretation experience for amateurs and professionals both.
Sponsorship pledges come with some great perks, including opportunities for you and others in your life to experience The Life By Soul System™ for yourselves!  As a sponsor for The Life By Soul System™ Book, you could receive:

A Family/Group Session – a very comprehensive all-day session that helps get to the root of your family, group, or team dynamics of up to 6 members.  This session is a $450-$540 value. (session to be scheduled before December 31st, 2014)
Either a 60-minute or 90-minute Life By Soul System individual session which can be used by you, or your friend or family member. These sessions are a $120-$180 value. (session to be scheduled before December 31st, 2014). 
Complementary registration for 2014 Life By Soul events - the first Life By Soul System Chart Interpretation workshop in which you can begin learning how to interpret a natal astrology chart using The Life By Soul System (a $90 value), AND/OR a lecture on Astrology & Numerology and Their Roles in Our Current Times that will discuss current astrological and numerological cycles as well as practical applications for these metaphysical sciences.  The lecture will be offered both in-person and via webcast and/or conference call (a $30+ value).
Autographed print copies of the book (hardcover and/or paperback).  There will be extremely limited numbers of each of these initially, so to receive one or more of these might be kind of a big deal. ($40+ value for hardcover, $20+ value for paperback)
A copy of the book in e-book format (+/- $10 value).
An invitation to the private book release party for you and your guest. The specific date, time, and place of this party will be announced once confirmed, but it will be held in the San Francisco Bay Area.
VIP access for any book signing events (line jumping, meet & greet)
Sponsorship credit/acknowledgment in the actual book on the credits/dedication page of the book.
And EVERYONE who sponsors the book will be acknowledged on the Life By Soul Website and in the monthly Life By Soul e-zine – there will be a page dedicated to those who make any size sponsorship contributions on the main website, and an article in the 2013 Scorpio E-Zine, including a list of all sponsors who are willing to make their names publicly known.

All perks will be either delivered or given status updates no later than January 13, 2014.

ALL sponsorship funds received will go exclusively to the marketing and promotion materials for the book for its optimal reach into astrology and numerology communities and into the general public. These materials will include a promo video, flyers in poster and postcard formats, multimedia marketing support, and additional print copies of the book.  Ideally, $6000 would be raised for this project to be fully funded, though every little bit is appreciated and helps bring the dream of this book getting out into the world closer to reality.Even if you are not in a position to make a sponsorship donation, please spread the word about the project by sharing the campaign with with people that you know enjoy and/or love astrology and numerology.  Please help me get the word out and about so the book can make it out into the world!

<h3>So, what is No Smoking in the Green Room?</h3>
<p>My name is Adam Lopez and I'm an artist manager and artist development specialist, I've done a lot of things in my time in the ""music business"" and have had a fantastic amount of successes as well as failures.  Being an <span>entrepreneur</span> in such an incredibly difficult industry envokes a lot of different emotions as well as sacrafices.</p>
<p>In <em>No Smoking in the Green Room</em> I touch upon every type of human emotion I felt going through getting me where I am today.  In <em>NSITGR</em> I talk about girlfriends, family, friends, technology, touring, music, college, parties, business and anything else a typical twenty-something may/has run into in an attempt to follow their dreams.</p>
<p>Is this a success story? Yes and No.  Yes, because I'm able to do something I love and am passionate about for a living and No, because being all of 25 years old who knows what the future could hold, but that's what makes it all the better.</p>
<h3>Industry professionals speaking about having worked with Adam:</h3>
<p><span>""I admire Adam's ability to tailor a unique strategy for each and every artist he works with.   No two artists are the same, and Adam takes great care to make sure each of his clients is following the best path and strategy for his or her career, personal attentiveness like this is a very special quality to find in a manager.  I've worked with Adam and his artists on a number of live streamed events, first at </span><a href=""http://stickam.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stickam.com</a><span> and currently at </span><a href=""http://younow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YouNow.com</a><span>.  Live streaming is still a relatively new and evolving arena, and it's been a pleasure experimenting and pushing the boundaries of it with Adam."" - <strong>Andy Wombwell</strong> (Founder of Stickam.com)</span></p>

</div></div>","So, what is No Smoking in the Green Room?
My name is Adam Lopez and I'm an artist manager and artist development specialist, I've done a lot of things in my time in the ""music business"" and have had a fantastic amount of successes as well as failures.  Being an entrepreneur in such an incredibly difficult industry envokes a lot of different emotions as well as sacrafices.
In No Smoking in the Green Room I touch upon every type of human emotion I felt going through getting me where I am today.  In NSITGR I talk about girlfriends, family, friends, technology, touring, music, college, parties, business and anything else a typical twenty-something may/has run into in an attempt to follow their dreams.
Is this a success story? Yes and No.  Yes, because I'm able to do something I love and am passionate about for a living and No, because being all of 25 years old who knows what the future could hold, but that's what makes it all the better.
Industry professionals speaking about having worked with Adam:
""I admire Adam's ability to tailor a unique strategy for each and every artist he works with.   No two artists are the same, and Adam takes great care to make sure each of his clients is following the best path and strategy for his or her career, personal attentiveness like this is a very special quality to find in a manager.  I've worked with Adam and his artists on a number of live streamed events, first at Stickam.com and currently at YouNow.com.  Live streaming is still a relatively new and evolving arena, and it's been a pleasure experimenting and pushing the boundaries of it with Adam."" - Andy Wombwell (Founder of Stickam.com)

</div>
<p align=""justify"">This is a true story based on the moving life of <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/SamuelBeniquez"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"" title=""Click here"">Samuel Beníquez</a>, a young man who, from the moment of his birth, was unjustly condemned and persecuted by an international religious sect, simply for being the product of the love which the global leader of that sect felt for a humble woman, which caused the global leader to ignore the sect's vow of celibacy. After his birth, the child experienced the bitter reality of being denied by his biological father, who denigrated his mother's reputation and forced her to give him up for adoption and then work as the maid in the home of the child's adoptive parents, thus hiding from his parishioners the fact that he was the real father. Within the parish, the boy meets his soul brother, <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/SamuelOrtiz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"" title=""Click here"">Samuel Ortiz</a>, and growing up, they help each other to escape from the sect, which makes them the object of persecutions, intrigue, death threats, lies, attempted murders and extortion for the rest of their lives. But this does not push them apart or stop them, and in an attempt to put an end to all the oppression, Samuel Ortiz helps Samuel Beníquez to file a paternity suit in court, to prove that the leader of this multinational religious sect was his biological father. This may allow them to put an end to the abuse, persecution and injustice from his father. Following a high profile public, legal, and media battle lasting almost a decade, the case finally reaches the Supreme Court. In the end, Samuel Beníquez prevails through a <a href=""http://es.scribd.com/doc/161841815/Resolucion-Caso-filiacion-Samuel-Beniquez-Vs-Teofilo-Vargas-Sein"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"" title=""Click here to see the court resolution"">DNA test which proves that said religious leader was in fact his biological father</a>, vindicating his biological mother and setting a legal precedent in family and adoption cases which will be forever recorded in history. Without doubt, the reader will be shocked to discover that even in the 21st century the power of some religious sects and the people who exercise it shows no mercy towards the victims. </p>

<p align=""justify"">The book is already written and WILL BE PUBLISHED regardless of the result of this campaign. We are only hoping to raise (at least) $65,000 dollars to help cover the production, translation in two languages and advertising costs (you can see where the money raised will go in the description of the campaign below). Consequently, we are presenting ourselves before our most loyal followers, indeed before everyone who loves children, justice and human rights, to ask for donations and to help spread the word about this book. </p>
<h2>What you will get</h2>
<p align=""justify"">In exchange for your support, we are offering great deals on the book, commemorative items and a unique opportunity to honor and remember those who have fallen along the way because they were victims of dangerous sects. You will have the satisfaction of being a part of a liberating movement because the greatest slavery of our time is that of the captive souls who fall victim to dangerous sects.</p>

For that reason, you will find more information about what constitutes a dangerous sect below. </p>
<blockquote>
<h2>What is a sect/cult?</h2>
<p align=""justify"">Michael Langone, Ph. D. in Clinical Psychology and the editor of one of the most prestigious scientific magazines that studies the phenomenon of sects defines the concept that we are analyzing in the following way:</p>
<em><strong><p align=""justify"">""A sect/cult is a group or movement which exhibits an excessive devotion to one person, idea or thing, and which uses unethical manipulation techniques to persuade and control (its followers); designed to achieve the goals of the leader of the group; resulting in the actual or potential consequences of harm to its members, their families and society in general.""</p></strong></em>
<p align=""left"">Subsequently, Dr. Langone adds that:</p>
<em><strong><p align=""justify"">""Given that the capacity to exploit other human beings is universal, any group can become a cult. However, the majority of institutionalized and socially accepted organizations have self-regulating mechanisms which restrict the development of sectarian groups"". (Langone 1988:1).</p></strong></em>
<h2>How does one recognize brainwashing</h2>
<p align=""justify"">Dr. Robert Lifton, Psychiatrist and Sociologist, in his classic work ""Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalitarianism"" defined eight criteria that are used to detect if there is ""brainwashing"" occurring.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<em><strong>Control of the Social Environment and Human Communication</strong></em>. This implies restricting the communication between the human beings that one intends to control, and includes hindering the communion of the individual with himself (for example, preventing one from having free time for personal reflection).</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Mystical Manipulation.</strong></em> Purposefully creating ""spiritual"" atmospheres which appear to be spontaneous but which are actually planned and studied to produce an effect. People interpret this effect as a ""spiritual experience"" ignoring that they were artificially created situations.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Redefining Language.</strong></em> Controlling words is useful for controlling people's thoughts. One is indoctrinated with simplistic concepts and (for example, clichés which tend to dishearten rather than motivate reasoning ""nobody can use their reasoning to reach enlightenment"". ""Only the chosen ones can understand what happens inside our group"").</li>
<li>
<em><strong>The Doctrine about the Person.</strong></em> It doesn't matter what a person is experiencing in reality, what is important is the belief in the dogma. The belief of the group surpasses the individual conscience and integrity, in terms with verifying results. An example is when some group claims that God has worked miracles of sanity but refuses to allow scientific verification of the matter. It can even be that a person is seriously ill and they will insist that it doesn't matter what we can see, the sick person is healthy.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>The Sacred Science.</strong></em> Doctrine with the scientific and moral absolute. Dogma is unquestionable.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>The Cult of Confession.</strong></em> Manipulation of public confession to break personal limits Restrictions or prohibitions of personal privacy. For example, the confession of faults or problems has well defined uses and limitations in both the therapeutic and the ecclesiastical settings. In this case, however, it is abused to denigrate and control people through the information revealed. There is an attempt to erase individuality in order to control the masses.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Unattainable Demands of Purity.</strong></em> Unattainable standard of perfection in order to create guilt and shame in the followers. People are punished and taught how to punish themselves for not reaching the ideal which is unattainable to begin with.</li>
<li>
<em><strong>Doing away with Existence.</strong></em> The group decides who has a right to exist and who doesn't. There is no legitimate alternative but to belong to that particular organization. In totalitarian government regimes, this is what justifies the execution of political dissidents.</li>
</ol>
<p align=""justify"">These mechanisms of influence have well-studied effects, both psychological and physiological, to create states of inhibition of reasoning and high susceptibility to control the behavior of a social group.</p>
<h2>Future Perspectives</h2>
<p align=""justify"">As the end of this decade approaches, <em>Destructive Cults/Sects</em> will continue to increase, particularly in the religious setting. According to Dr. Hockman this will be the result not only of apocalyptic mystics but particularly due to the breakdown of society in general.  (Hockman 179-187).</p>
<p align=""justify"">This implies that the subject of <em>Cults/Sects</em> will become increasingly more relevant. This is shown by the fact that these subjects are taking up more and more space in the media. In light of this, there is a need for reliable methods of analysis to make classifications about what does and what does not constitute a sect.</p>
<p align=""justify"">The criteria have to be as strict as possible and must consider that a group may be classified as a cult from different perspectives. For example: <em>Jehovah's Witnesses</em> are considered a cult/sect from the religious point of view for instilling non-Christian dogmas. At the same time, they are considered a sect <em>sociologically</em> for preventing, using techniques of coercion, blood transfusions for their followers, even minors, and this leads to unnecessary deaths every year and violates the universal human rights of children.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Modern United States is a society which is beginning to demand accountability, and that all institutions show transparency in their ends and means of work. Religious organizations are not exempt from being held accountable just like any other institution.</p>

Destructive Cults/Sects pose a public health problem because of the social impact that they have.

<p>Esta es una historia verídica basada en la conmovedora vida de <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/SamuelBeniquez"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"" title=""Samuel Beníquez"">Samuel Beníquez</a>. Un joven que desde su nacimiento se ganó injustamente el repudio y la persecución de una secta religiosa internacional, por la única razón de ser producto del amor que sentía el líder mundial de la misma, por una humilde mujer, obviando dicho líder el mandato de celibato de su secta. Luego de su nacimiento, el niño experimenta la amarga realidad de que su padre biológico lo niega como hijo, denigra la reputación de su madre, obliga a ésta a darlo en adopción y la obliga a trabajar de sirvienta en la casa de los padres adoptivos del niño, para ocultar así delante de toda su feligresía que él era el progenitor. Dentro de la feligresía, el niño llega a conocer a su hermano del alma, <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/SamuelOrtiz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"" title=""Samuel Ortiz"">Samuel Ortiz</a> y al crecer, mutuamente se ayudan a escapar de esa secta y por tal motivo son objeto de persecuciones, intrigas, amenazas de muerte, mentiras, intentos de asesinato y chantaje durante toda su trayectoria de vida. Esto no los separa al uno del otro, ni tampoco los detiene, y para tratar de poner un alto a toda esa opresora situación, Samuel Ortiz ayuda a Samuel Beníquez a radicar en los tribunales un pleito de filiación, para probar que el líder de esa multinacional secta religiosa era su padre biológico; de esta manera lograrían detener el abuso, persecuciones y la injusticia de su padre. Luego de una batalla mediática, pública y legal de casi una década, el caso judicial llega hasta el Tribunal Supremo. Al final, Samuel Beníquez prevalece en la prueba de <a href=""http://es.scribd.com/doc/161841815/Resolucion-Caso-filiacion-Samuel-Beniquez-Vs-Teofilo-Vargas-Sein"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_new"" title=""Clic aquí"">ADN, logrando así evidenciar que dicho líder religioso era su padre biológico</a>, reivindicando a su madre biológica y sentando así un precedente legal en casos de familia y adopción que quedará para siempre escrito en la historia. Sin duda, el lector quedará impactado al darse cuenta que todavía en el Siglo XXI el poder de algunas sectas y las personas que lo ejercen pueden ser sumamente despiadadas con quien deciden serlo.</p>

<div align=""justify""><p>Tal vez esta historia no es una historia aislada. Posiblemente múltiples mujeres y recién nacidos, alrededor del mundo, han tenido que atravesar por problemas parecidos al que vivieron los personajes principales de esta historia verídica, por causa de sectas destructivas. Por eso, a continuación te ofrecemos más información acerca de lo que es una secta peligrosa.</p></div>
<div align=""justify"">
<blockquote>
<h2>¿Qué es una secta?
  </h2>
<p>Michael Langone, Ph. D. Doctor en Psicología Clínica y editor de una de las más prestigiadas revistas científicas que estudian el fenómeno de las sectas, define así el concepto que estamos analizando: 
  </p>
<p><strong style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><em>""Secta es un grupo o movimiento, que exhibe una devoción excesiva a una persona, idea o cosa y que emplea técnicas antiéticas de manipulación para persuadir y controlar (a sus adeptos); diseñadas para lograr las metas del líder del grupo; trayendo como consecuencias actuales o posibles, el daño a sus miembros, a los familiares de ellos o a la sociedad en general"". 
  </em></strong></p>
<p>Después el Dr. Langone añade que: 
  </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><em><strong>""Dado que la capacidad para explotar a otros seres humanos es universal, cualquier grupo puede llegar a convertirse en una secta. Sin embargo, la mayoría de las organizaciones institucionalizadas y socialmente aceptadas, tienen mecanismos de auto-regulación que restringen el desarrollo de grupúsculos sectarios"". (Langone 1988:1). 
  </strong></em></p>
<h2>Cómo se reconoce cuando hay un lavado de cerebro</h2>
<p>El Dr. Robert Lifton, Psiquiatra y Sociólogo, definió en su obra clásica ""La Reforma del Pensamiento y la Psicología del Totalitarismo"" ocho criterios para detectar cuando se está implementando el llamado ""lavado de cerebro"".</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><strong><em>Control de la Atmósfera Social y de la Comunicación Humana.</em></strong></span> Esto implica coartar la comunicación entre los seres humanos que se intenta controlar, e incluye obstaculizar la comunión del individuo consigo mismo [por ejemplo al evitar que tenga tiempo libre para la reflexión personal].</li>
<li>
<em><strong><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Manipulación Mística.-</span></strong></em> Construir premeditadamente atmósferas ""espirituales"" que parecen espontáneas pero que en realidad están planeadas y estudiadas para producir un efecto. La gente interpreta este efecto como una ""experiencia espiritual"", al ignorar que fueron situaciones fabricadas.</li>
<li>
<strong style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><em>Redefinir el Lenguaje.</em></strong> Controlar las palabras es útil para controlar el pensamiento de las personas. Se adoctrina con conceptos simplistas y (por ejemplo cliches que tienden a desalentar más que alentar el razonamiento ""nadie puede utilizar su razón para alcanzar la iluminación"". ""Sólo los elegidos pueden entender lo que sucede al interior de nuestra agrupación.)</li>
<li>
<em><strong><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">La Doctrina sobre la Persona.</span></strong></em> No importa lo que una persona esté experimentando en la realidad, es la creencia en el dogma lo que es importante. La creencia del grupo rebasa la conciencia individual y la integridad, en cuanto a comprobar resultados. Un ejemplo es cuando algún grupo proclama que Dios ha realizado milagros de sanidad pero se niega a hacer verificaciones científicas al respecto. Puede ser inclusive que una persona esté gravemente enferma y se asegure que no importa lo que se vea, ya está sana. Es más importante sostener el dogma que el bienestar de las personas y lo que indica la realidad.</li>
<li>
<strong style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><em>La Ciencia Sagrada.</em></strong> Doctrina con el absoluto, científico y moral. El dogma es incuestionable.</li>
<li>
<em><strong><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">El Culto a la Confesión.</span></strong></em> Manipulación de la confesión pública para romper los límites personales. Restricciones o prohibiciones a la privacía personal. Por ejemplo, la confesión de faltas o problemas tiene usos y limitaciones bien definidas tanto en el ámbito terapéutico como en el eclesiástico. En este caso se abusa del uso, para denigrar y controlar a las personas a través de la información vertida. Se intenta borrar la individualidad para ser controlado en masa.</li>
<li>
<strong style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><em>Demandas de Pureza Inalcanzables.</em></strong> Estándar inalcanzable de perfección para crear culpabilidad y vergüenza en los adeptos. La gente es castigada y enseñada a autocastigarse por no llegar al ideal que de inicio es imposible de alcanzar.</li>
<li>
<em><strong><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">La Dispensación de la Existencia.</span></strong></em> El grupo decide quién tiene derecho a existir y quién no. No existe ninguna alternativa legítima sino sólo el pertenecer a esa organización en particular. En regímenes gubernamentales totalitarios esto es lo que justifica la ejecución de disidentes políticos.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Los anteriores mecanismos de influencia tienen efectos bien estudiados, tanto Psicológicos como Fisiológicos, para crear estados de inhibición del razonamiento y alta sugestibilidad para controlar la conducta de un grupo social.</p>
<h2>Perspectivas a Futuro</h2>
<p>Conforme se acerca el fin de esta década, las <em style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><strong>Sectas/cultos</strong></em> <em style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><strong>destructivos</strong></em> irán en aumento, especialmente las de corte religioso. Según el Dr. Hockman esto será consecuencia no sólo de misticismos apocalípticos sino especialmente por el deterioro de la sociedad en general. (Hockman 179-187). </p>
<p>Esto implica que el tema de las <strong><em><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">sectas/cultos</span></em></strong> tomará cada vez más relevancia. Así lo evidencia en el mundo el hecho de que estos temas ocupen cada vez más espacios en los medios de comunicación. En vista de esto, es necesario contar con metodologías confiables de análisis para hacer clasificaciones, acerca de qué constituye o no una <em style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><strong>secta</strong></em>. </p>
<p>Los criterios deben ser los más rigurosos posibles y se debe tener en cuenta que un grupo puede ser clasificado como secta desde diferentes perspectivas. Por ejemplo: <strong><em><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Los Testigos de Jehová</span></em></strong> son considerados una secta desde el punto de vista teológico por inculcar dogmas no cristianos. Al mismo tiempo son considerados una secta <em style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><strong>sociológicamente</strong></em>, por impedir con técnicas coercitivas la transfusión de sangre a sus adeptos, incluidos menores de edad, lo cual genera muertes innecesarias cada año y viola los derechos universales de los menores de edad. </p>
<p>El Estados Unidos de hoy es una sociedad que comienza a pedir cuentas y exige que todas las instituciones sean transparentes en sus fines y métodos de trabajo. Las organizaciones religiosas no están exentas de rendir cuentas claras al igual que cualquier otra institución.</p>

Can you imagine being chased from your mother's womb?
Can you imagine being born and having your biological father force your mother to give you up for adoption?
Can you imagine growing up and realizing that your parents are not your biological parents and that your nanny is your real biological mother?




This is a true story based on the moving life of Samuel Beníquez, a young man who, from the moment of his birth, was unjustly condemned and persecuted by an international religious sect, simply for being the product of the love which the global leader of that sect felt for a humble woman, which caused the global leader to ignore the sect's vow of celibacy. After his birth, the child experienced the bitter reality of being denied by his biological father, who denigrated his mother's reputation and forced her to give him up for adoption and then work as the maid in the home of the child's adoptive parents, thus hiding from his parishioners the fact that he was the real father. Within the parish, the boy meets his soul brother, Samuel Ortiz, and growing up, they help each other to escape from the sect, which makes them the object of persecutions, intrigue, death threats, lies, attempted murders and extortion for the rest of their lives. But this does not push them apart or stop them, and in an attempt to put an end to all the oppression, Samuel Ortiz helps Samuel Beníquez to file a paternity suit in court, to prove that the leader of this multinational religious sect was his biological father. This may allow them to put an end to the abuse, persecution and injustice from his father. Following a high profile public, legal, and media battle lasting almost a decade, the case finally reaches the Supreme Court. In the end, Samuel Beníquez prevails through a DNA test which proves that said religious leader was in fact his biological father, vindicating his biological mother and setting a legal precedent in family and adoption cases which will be forever recorded in history. Without doubt, the reader will be shocked to discover that even in the 21st century the power of some religious sects and the people who exercise it shows no mercy towards the victims. 
""The greatest form of slavery of our time is that of the captive souls that become victims of dangerous sects."" Samuel Beníquez
 




What we need
The book is already written and WILL BE PUBLISHED regardless of the result of this campaign. We are only hoping to raise (at least) $65,000 dollars to help cover the production, translation in two languages and advertising costs (you can see where the money raised will go in the description of the campaign below). Consequently, we are presenting ourselves before our most loyal followers, indeed before everyone who loves children, justice and human rights, to ask for donations and to help spread the word about this book. 
What you will get
In exchange for your support, we are offering great deals on the book, commemorative items and a unique opportunity to honor and remember those who have fallen along the way because they were victims of dangerous sects. You will have the satisfaction of being a part of a liberating movement because the greatest slavery of our time is that of the captive souls who fall victim to dangerous sects.
 
You too can be a liberator of souls!




The profits of the direct sale of this book will go in part to recover the costs of the legal fees that generated this case and the other side will be donated to the nonprofit entity Samuel & Samuel Foundation, Corp.. This foundation is a foundation created by Samuel Ortiz and Samuel Beníquez to help victims of dangerous sects, with education, legal assistance and support.


This is probably not an isolated story. It is highly likely that multiple women and newborn children all over the world have had to face similar problems to the ones that the main characters in this true story had to face as a result of destructive sects. For that reason, you will find more information about what constitutes a dangerous sect below. 

What is a sect/cult?
Michael Langone, Ph. D. in Clinical Psychology and the editor of one of the most prestigious scientific magazines that studies the phenomenon of sects defines the concept that we are analyzing in the following way:
""A sect/cult is a group or movement which exhibits an excessive devotion to one person, idea or thing, and which uses unethical manipulation techniques to persuade and control (its followers); designed to achieve the goals of the leader of the group; resulting in the actual or potential consequences of harm to its members, their families and society in general.""
Subsequently, Dr. Langone adds that:
""Given that the capacity to exploit other human beings is universal, any group can become a cult. However, the majority of institutionalized and socially accepted organizations have self-regulating mechanisms which restrict the development of sectarian groups"". (Langone 1988:1).
How does one recognize brainwashing
Dr. Robert Lifton, Psychiatrist and Sociologist, in his classic work ""Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalitarianism"" defined eight criteria that are used to detect if there is ""brainwashing"" occurring.


Control of the Social Environment and Human Communication. This implies restricting the communication between the human beings that one intends to control, and includes hindering the communion of the individual with himself (for example, preventing one from having free time for personal reflection).

Mystical Manipulation. Purposefully creating ""spiritual"" atmospheres which appear to be spontaneous but which are actually planned and studied to produce an effect. People interpret this effect as a ""spiritual experience"" ignoring that they were artificially created situations.

Redefining Language. Controlling words is useful for controlling people's thoughts. One is indoctrinated with simplistic concepts and (for example, clichés which tend to dishearten rather than motivate reasoning ""nobody can use their reasoning to reach enlightenment"". ""Only the chosen ones can understand what happens inside our group"").

The Doctrine about the Person. It doesn't matter what a person is experiencing in reality, what is important is the belief in the dogma. The belief of the group surpasses the individual conscience and integrity, in terms with verifying results. An example is when some group claims that God has worked miracles of sanity but refuses to allow scientific verification of the matter. It can even be that a person is seriously ill and they will insist that it doesn't matter what we can see, the sick person is healthy.

The Sacred Science. Doctrine with the scientific and moral absolute. Dogma is unquestionable.

The Cult of Confession. Manipulation of public confession to break personal limits Restrictions or prohibitions of personal privacy. For example, the confession of faults or problems has well defined uses and limitations in both the therapeutic and the ecclesiastical settings. In this case, however, it is abused to denigrate and control people through the information revealed. There is an attempt to erase individuality in order to control the masses.

Unattainable Demands of Purity. Unattainable standard of perfection in order to create guilt and shame in the followers. People are punished and taught how to punish themselves for not reaching the ideal which is unattainable to begin with.

Doing away with Existence. The group decides who has a right to exist and who doesn't. There is no legitimate alternative but to belong to that particular organization. In totalitarian government regimes, this is what justifies the execution of political dissidents.

These mechanisms of influence have well-studied effects, both psychological and physiological, to create states of inhibition of reasoning and high susceptibility to control the behavior of a social group.
Future Perspectives
As the end of this decade approaches, Destructive Cults/Sects will continue to increase, particularly in the religious setting. According to Dr. Hockman this will be the result not only of apocalyptic mystics but particularly due to the breakdown of society in general.  (Hockman 179-187).
This implies that the subject of Cults/Sects will become increasingly more relevant. This is shown by the fact that these subjects are taking up more and more space in the media. In light of this, there is a need for reliable methods of analysis to make classifications about what does and what does not constitute a sect.
The criteria have to be as strict as possible and must consider that a group may be classified as a cult from different perspectives. For example: Jehovah's Witnesses are considered a cult/sect from the religious point of view for instilling non-Christian dogmas. At the same time, they are considered a sect sociologically for preventing, using techniques of coercion, blood transfusions for their followers, even minors, and this leads to unnecessary deaths every year and violates the universal human rights of children.
Modern United States is a society which is beginning to demand accountability, and that all institutions show transparency in their ends and means of work. Religious organizations are not exempt from being held accountable just like any other institution.
Speech presented by Professor Jorge Erdely G. at the National School of Anthropology and History.


People like us must raise our voices so that this does not continue to happen anywhere in the world, and this is why it is imperative to publish the book The Child Versus The Beast, to educate and raise awareness within society. Destructive Cults/Sects pose a public health problem because of the social impact that they have. Hockman's definition about what constitutes a cult goes beyond the medical setting to enrich legal ethics. Analyze the phrase: fully informed consent and you will reach the conclusion that the very spirit of this concept is the one that, when violated, gives rise to the typical crime of fraud in our society.
Only through education and by making the world aware of this problem will we reach our goal of having fewer and fewer people fall victim every day to the evil claws of unscrupulous, money-driven and power-hungry individuals.

Just like David against Goliath, each one of you can contribute something to this fight: The Child Versus The Beast. All donations, small or large, will go towards providing education, encouragement and hope, through this book, to millions of people affected by this evil enveloping the world. Let's all get together so that this story can be published and the whole world can know about it. You also carry a defenseless child inside you who can fight against this great evil beast. Let us show what the power of good and unity can do.

Idioma Español

¿Te imaginas ser perseguido desde el vientre de tu madre? 
¿Te imaginas nacer y que tu padre biológico obligue a tu madre a darte en adopción?
¿Te imaginas crecer y darte cuenta que tus padres no son tus padres biológicos y que tu nana es tu verdadera madre biológica?



Esta es una historia verídica basada en la conmovedora vida de Samuel Beníquez. Un joven que desde su nacimiento se ganó injustamente el repudio y la persecución de una secta religiosa internacional, por la única razón de ser producto del amor que sentía el líder mundial de la misma, por una humilde mujer, obviando dicho líder el mandato de celibato de su secta. Luego de su nacimiento, el niño experimenta la amarga realidad de que su padre biológico lo niega como hijo, denigra la reputación de su madre, obliga a ésta a darlo en adopción y la obliga a trabajar de sirvienta en la casa de los padres adoptivos del niño, para ocultar así delante de toda su feligresía que él era el progenitor. Dentro de la feligresía, el niño llega a conocer a su hermano del alma, Samuel Ortiz y al crecer, mutuamente se ayudan a escapar de esa secta y por tal motivo son objeto de persecuciones, intrigas, amenazas de muerte, mentiras, intentos de asesinato y chantaje durante toda su trayectoria de vida. Esto no los separa al uno del otro, ni tampoco los detiene, y para tratar de poner un alto a toda esa opresora situación, Samuel Ortiz ayuda a Samuel Beníquez a radicar en los tribunales un pleito de filiación, para probar que el líder de esa multinacional secta religiosa era su padre biológico; de esta manera lograrían detener el abuso, persecuciones y la injusticia de su padre. Luego de una batalla mediática, pública y legal de casi una década, el caso judicial llega hasta el Tribunal Supremo. Al final, Samuel Beníquez prevalece en la prueba de ADN, logrando así evidenciar que dicho líder religioso era su padre biológico, reivindicando a su madre biológica y sentando así un precedente legal en casos de familia y adopción que quedará para siempre escrito en la historia. Sin duda, el lector quedará impactado al darse cuenta que todavía en el Siglo XXI el poder de algunas sectas y las personas que lo ejercen pueden ser sumamente despiadadas con quien deciden serlo.
 ""La mayor esclavitud de este tiempo, es la de almas cautivas que son víctimas de sectas peligrosas."" Samuel Beníquez

Tal vez esta historia no es una historia aislada. Posiblemente múltiples mujeres y recién nacidos, alrededor del mundo, han tenido que atravesar por problemas parecidos al que vivieron los personajes principales de esta historia verídica, por causa de sectas destructivas. Por eso, a continuación te ofrecemos más información acerca de lo que es una secta peligrosa.


¿Qué es una secta?
  
Michael Langone, Ph. D. Doctor en Psicología Clínica y editor de una de las más prestigiadas revistas científicas que estudian el fenómeno de las sectas, define así el concepto que estamos analizando: 
  
""Secta es un grupo o movimiento, que exhibe una devoción excesiva a una persona, idea o cosa y que emplea técnicas antiéticas de manipulación para persuadir y controlar (a sus adeptos); diseñadas para lograr las metas del líder del grupo; trayendo como consecuencias actuales o posibles, el daño a sus miembros, a los familiares de ellos o a la sociedad en general"". 
  
Después el Dr. Langone añade que: 
  
""Dado que la capacidad para explotar a otros seres humanos es universal, cualquier grupo puede llegar a convertirse en una secta. Sin embargo, la mayoría de las organizaciones institucionalizadas y socialmente aceptadas, tienen mecanismos de auto-regulación que restringen el desarrollo de grupúsculos sectarios"". (Langone 1988:1). 
  
Cómo se reconoce cuando hay un lavado de cerebro
El Dr. Robert Lifton, Psiquiatra y Sociólogo, definió en su obra clásica ""La Reforma del Pensamiento y la Psicología del Totalitarismo"" ocho criterios para detectar cuando se está implementando el llamado ""lavado de cerebro"".


Control de la Atmósfera Social y de la Comunicación Humana. Esto implica coartar la comunicación entre los seres humanos que se intenta controlar, e incluye obstaculizar la comunión del individuo consigo mismo [por ejemplo al evitar que tenga tiempo libre para la reflexión personal].

Manipulación Mística.- Construir premeditadamente atmósferas ""espirituales"" que parecen espontáneas pero que en realidad están planeadas y estudiadas para producir un efecto. La gente interpreta este efecto como una ""experiencia espiritual"", al ignorar que fueron situaciones fabricadas.

Redefinir el Lenguaje. Controlar las palabras es útil para controlar el pensamiento de las personas. Se adoctrina con conceptos simplistas y (por ejemplo cliches que tienden a desalentar más que alentar el razonamiento ""nadie puede utilizar su razón para alcanzar la iluminación"". ""Sólo los elegidos pueden entender lo que sucede al interior de nuestra agrupación.)

La Doctrina sobre la Persona. No importa lo que una persona esté experimentando en la realidad, es la creencia en el dogma lo que es importante. La creencia del grupo rebasa la conciencia individual y la integridad, en cuanto a comprobar resultados. Un ejemplo es cuando algún grupo proclama que Dios ha realizado milagros de sanidad pero se niega a hacer verificaciones científicas al respecto. Puede ser inclusive que una persona esté gravemente enferma y se asegure que no importa lo que se vea, ya está sana. Es más importante sostener el dogma que el bienestar de las personas y lo que indica la realidad.

La Ciencia Sagrada. Doctrina con el absoluto, científico y moral. El dogma es incuestionable.

El Culto a la Confesión. Manipulación de la confesión pública para romper los límites personales. Restricciones o prohibiciones a la privacía personal. Por ejemplo, la confesión de faltas o problemas tiene usos y limitaciones bien definidas tanto en el ámbito terapéutico como en el eclesiástico. En este caso se abusa del uso, para denigrar y controlar a las personas a través de la información vertida. Se intenta borrar la individualidad para ser controlado en masa.

Demandas de Pureza Inalcanzables. Estándar inalcanzable de perfección para crear culpabilidad y vergüenza en los adeptos. La gente es castigada y enseñada a autocastigarse por no llegar al ideal que de inicio es imposible de alcanzar.

La Dispensación de la Existencia. El grupo decide quién tiene derecho a existir y quién no. No existe ninguna alternativa legítima sino sólo el pertenecer a esa organización en particular. En regímenes gubernamentales totalitarios esto es lo que justifica la ejecución de disidentes políticos.

Los anteriores mecanismos de influencia tienen efectos bien estudiados, tanto Psicológicos como Fisiológicos, para crear estados de inhibición del razonamiento y alta sugestibilidad para controlar la conducta de un grupo social.
Perspectivas a Futuro
Conforme se acerca el fin de esta década, las Sectas/cultos destructivos irán en aumento, especialmente las de corte religioso. Según el Dr. Hockman esto será consecuencia no sólo de misticismos apocalípticos sino especialmente por el deterioro de la sociedad en general. (Hockman 179-187). 
Esto implica que el tema de las sectas/cultos tomará cada vez más relevancia. Así lo evidencia en el mundo el hecho de que estos temas ocupen cada vez más espacios en los medios de comunicación. En vista de esto, es necesario contar con metodologías confiables de análisis para hacer clasificaciones, acerca de qué constituye o no una secta. 
Los criterios deben ser los más rigurosos posibles y se debe tener en cuenta que un grupo puede ser clasificado como secta desde diferentes perspectivas. Por ejemplo: Los Testigos de Jehová son considerados una secta desde el punto de vista teológico por inculcar dogmas no cristianos. Al mismo tiempo son considerados una secta sociológicamente, por impedir con técnicas coercitivas la transfusión de sangre a sus adeptos, incluidos menores de edad, lo cual genera muertes innecesarias cada año y viola los derechos universales de los menores de edad. 
El Estados Unidos de hoy es una sociedad que comienza a pedir cuentas y exige que todas las instituciones sean transparentes en sus fines y métodos de trabajo. Las organizaciones religiosas no están exentas de rendir cuentas claras al igual que cualquier otra institución.
Ponencia presentada por el profesor Jorge Erdely G. en la Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia.




Es necesario que personas como tú y como nosotros levantemos nuestra voz para que esto no continúe sucediendo en ninguna parte del mundo y por eso es imperioso publicar el libro El Niño Versus La Bestia, para llevar educación y concienciación a la sociedad. Las Sectas Destructivas presentan un problema de salud pública por el impacto social que tienen. La definición de Hockman sobre lo que constituye una secta, trasciende aún el ámbito médico, para enriquecer la ética jurídica. Analícese la frase: consentimiento con pleno conocimiento y se llegará a la conclusión de que el espíritu mismo de este concepto es el que, al ser violado, da lugar a la tipificación del delito de fraude en nuestra sociedad.
Solo con educación y exponiendo este problema ante el mundo entero lograremos nuestro objetivo de que cada día menos gente inocente caigan en las garras de personas sin escrúpulos, con intenciones de lucro y de tener poder totalitario sobre las almas cautivas.



Al igual que David contra Goliat, cada uno de ustedes puede aportar algo a esta lucha de El Niño Versus La Bestia. Todas las donaciones, grandes o pequeñas, serán para brindar educación, aliento y esperanza, a través de este libro, a millones de personas afectadas por este mal que está arropando al mundo. Vamos a unirnos todos para que esta historia pueda ser publicada y que el mundo entero la conozca. En tu interior tú también llevas a un niño indefenso que puede luchar contra esa gran bestia que es el mal. Mostremos lo que el poder del bien y de la unión puede lograr.

<h3>The Back Story<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Brent Millis. I'm an independent author and editor with a penchant for science fiction/cyberpunk and grindhouse-style theater. I am a child of the 80s, so I have an inexplicable love for those years, especially its movies, music, fiction, comics, and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">boom chica-chica bwow-wow boom</span> adult movies.<br/><br/>Of course, the 80s wouldn't be the 80s without all the great sexy pinup girls of the B-movie 50s and 60s. I spent weekend afternoons mesmerized by old sci-fi flicks on TV and nights engrossed in thoughts of all the curious things aliens/monsters might do to the heroines if they had had <span style=""font-style: italic;"">just </span>five minutes longer with them alone before the hero appeared on-scene.<br/><br/>At university, I started reading <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Heavy Metal Magazine</span> and enjoying 90s anime like <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>, <i>Ninja Scroll</i>, <i>MD Geist</i>, <i>MegaZone 23</i>, <i>Macross</i> and <i>Urotsudouji</i>. Masamune Shirow and <a href=""http://www.urotsukidoji.jp/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Toshio Maeda"">Toshio Maeda</a> successfully combined science fiction/cyberpunk and adult themes. More recently, the pleasure of living in Japan for over the past decade has introduced me to anime/manga gems like <i>Redline</i>, <i>BLAME!</i>, <i>Bio Mega, Dorohedoro</i> and other titles which have also been very influential.<br/><br/>A couple years ago, when social networking became big, I started publishing my own fiction. ""Media Whores"" was my first title. It garnered interested across the Internet and captured the attentions of folks like Warren Ellis and Annalee Newitz. I followed it up with ""de Sade Assassins"" and <i>Bukkake Brawl</i> -- two x-rated titles that sell well every month in Amazon's Kindle store.<br/><br/>While working as the editor on a charity anthology (see <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Who is Brent Millis (the publisher)?</span>), I created strong relationship with more than 70 authors in various parts of the world. When we were finished, many of those same good folks expressed interested in working with me on other projects. I received invitations to write for various projects and was asked to head up a second charity anthology of the same nature. While (as of this date) I am not currently working on a second charity anthology, a strong interest in editing did take hold in me -- FMO, a tri-annual fiction e-magazine heavily steeped in strong adult themes and hyperviolence (of the action movie/grindhouse type).<br/><br/>I need your help however. It's not easy to publish, even electronically. The cost of doing things right is measured in start-up cash. It's unavoidable. I could do it for free, but it would take much longer to interest authors into submitting, and the quality would just not be the same.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is FMO?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A tri-annual (three issues a year) fiction e-magazine heavily steeped in strong adult themes. Every issue will feature three to five ORIGINAL stories by various authors from around the world. While the magazine will be in English primarily, it is also my ambition to include non-English work alongside its English translation (with work done by experienced/professional translators).<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Who is Brent Millis (the publisher)?</h3>Brent Millis is better known (perhaps) as Made in DNA, author of <i>Bukkake Brawl</i>, ""de Sade Assassins"", ""Media Whores"" and other x-rated fiction.<br/><br/>He is also the editor and publisher of <a href=""http://bit.ly/kizunacharity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-style: italic;"" target=""_blank"" title=""Kizuna: Fiction for Japan"">Kizuna: Fiction for Japan</a>, a mixed-genre fiction charity anthology that benefits the orphans of the Tohoku disaster (earthquake/tsunami/nuclear power plant) on March 11, 2011. (A title that is not adult in nature.)<br/><br/>Living in Japan for over a decade, the disaster that struck his adopted home was a like any other he has ever experienced. Imploring to his fellow authors, he successfully created the Kizuna project and brought together 75 authors from 11 different countries in a book like none other. Boasting the talent of Michael Moorcock, John Shirley, Jon Courtenay Grimwood, Ken Asamatsu, Joseph Pulver, Sr, Glynn Barrass, Trent Zelazny and many others. Please see this link for complete information and a listing of all the authors.<br/><br/>So there is experience and accomplishment behind the name.</div><div><br/></div><div><h3>What is the current state of the project?</h3></div><div>While the fundraising phase started in late October, I have been working hard to solicit submissions from authors and cover artists for well over a month. I've received a great amount of positive feedback, and currently have received, reviewed and accepted three stories for the premiere issue:</div><div><br/></div><div>

</div>
<div>To be announced by DL Warner<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>There are other authors who are currently in the process of working on titles for the first three titles, but I cannot yet give their names. I will not promise work until the work is FINISHED. This is commitment to a proper business model.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<br/><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span><br/>
</div><div>
<p>When the goal is reached, the issues will be published over the year 2012, which in turn will give me the power to publish more issues as the work sells. Thus the ultimate goal is to create a viable, continuous publication that will excite readers for many years to come.</p>
<p><br/>For some reason, should the goal not be met, the available funds will be used to create fewer issues, yet I will continue to work toward the same goal of a continuing tri-annual body of work that features various authors (and cover artists). This is a not a goal I am willing to let die. I am simply asking folks for a bit of help in getting set up. In return, you will get perks.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So where does the money go? Every cent of your contribution will cover the first three issues, which breaks down into the following:<br/></p>
<p>$1000 &gt; Cover/image/mascot/wallpaper art from artists like Miko Peru (whose rough sketch art is the icon and image of this fundraiser), Hiroki Otsuka (Pirontan) - a professional hentai manga artist with 21 manga volumes under his belt, Toshio Maeda - a master hentai artist, who, as the father of tentacle themes, needs no introduction, and others<br/>$2250 &gt; Fiction.

The Back Story


My name is Brent Millis. I'm an independent author and editor with a penchant for science fiction/cyberpunk and grindhouse-style theater. I am a child of the 80s, so I have an inexplicable love for those years, especially its movies, music, fiction, comics, and boom chica-chica bwow-wow boom adult movies.Of course, the 80s wouldn't be the 80s without all the great sexy pinup girls of the B-movie 50s and 60s. I spent weekend afternoons mesmerized by old sci-fi flicks on TV and nights engrossed in thoughts of all the curious things aliens/monsters might do to the heroines if they had had just five minutes longer with them alone before the hero appeared on-scene.At university, I started reading Heavy Metal Magazine and enjoying 90s anime like Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, MD Geist, MegaZone 23, Macross and Urotsudouji. Masamune Shirow and Toshio Maeda successfully combined science fiction/cyberpunk and adult themes. More recently, the pleasure of living in Japan for over the past decade has introduced me to anime/manga gems like Redline, BLAME!, Bio Mega, Dorohedoro and other titles which have also been very influential.A couple years ago, when social networking became big, I started publishing my own fiction. ""Media Whores"" was my first title. It garnered interested across the Internet and captured the attentions of folks like Warren Ellis and Annalee Newitz. I followed it up with ""de Sade Assassins"" and Bukkake Brawl -- two x-rated titles that sell well every month in Amazon's Kindle store.While working as the editor on a charity anthology (see Who is Brent Millis (the publisher)?), I created strong relationship with more than 70 authors in various parts of the world. When we were finished, many of those same good folks expressed interested in working with me on other projects. I received invitations to write for various projects and was asked to head up a second charity anthology of the same nature. While (as of this date) I am not currently working on a second charity anthology, a strong interest in editing did take hold in me -- FMO, a tri-annual fiction e-magazine heavily steeped in strong adult themes and hyperviolence (of the action movie/grindhouse type).I need your help however. It's not easy to publish, even electronically. The cost of doing things right is measured in start-up cash. It's unavoidable. I could do it for free, but it would take much longer to interest authors into submitting, and the quality would just not be the same.

What is FMO?

A tri-annual (three issues a year) fiction e-magazine heavily steeped in strong adult themes. Every issue will feature three to five ORIGINAL stories by various authors from around the world. While the magazine will be in English primarily, it is also my ambition to include non-English work alongside its English translation (with work done by experienced/professional translators).

Who is Brent Millis (the publisher)?Brent Millis is better known (perhaps) as Made in DNA, author of Bukkake Brawl, ""de Sade Assassins"", ""Media Whores"" and other x-rated fiction.He is also the editor and publisher of Kizuna: Fiction for Japan, a mixed-genre fiction charity anthology that benefits the orphans of the Tohoku disaster (earthquake/tsunami/nuclear power plant) on March 11, 2011. (A title that is not adult in nature.)Living in Japan for over a decade, the disaster that struck his adopted home was a like any other he has ever experienced. Imploring to his fellow authors, he successfully created the Kizuna project and brought together 75 authors from 11 different countries in a book like none other. Boasting the talent of Michael Moorcock, John Shirley, Jon Courtenay Grimwood, Ken Asamatsu, Joseph Pulver, Sr, Glynn Barrass, Trent Zelazny and many others. Please see this link for complete information and a listing of all the authors.So there is experience and accomplishment behind the name.What is the current state of the project?While the fundraising phase started in late October, I have been working hard to solicit submissions from authors and cover artists for well over a month. I've received a great amount of positive feedback, and currently have received, reviewed and accepted three stories for the premiere issue:
""Espionage Girls"" by Glynn Barrass

""The Wasters"" by John Trevillian

""C-S"" by Elizabeth Black

To be announced by DL Warner

There are other authors who are currently in the process of working on titles for the first three titles, but I cannot yet give their names. I will not promise work until the work is FINISHED. This is commitment to a proper business model.

The Impact

When the goal is reached, the issues will be published over the year 2012, which in turn will give me the power to publish more issues as the work sells. Thus the ultimate goal is to create a viable, continuous publication that will excite readers for many years to come.
For some reason, should the goal not be met, the available funds will be used to create fewer issues, yet I will continue to work toward the same goal of a continuing tri-annual body of work that features various authors (and cover artists). This is a not a goal I am willing to let die. I am simply asking folks for a bit of help in getting set up. In return, you will get perks.


What We Need & What You Get
So where does the money go? Every cent of your contribution will cover the first three issues, which breaks down into the following:
$1000 > Cover/image/mascot/wallpaper art from artists like Miko Peru (whose rough sketch art is the icon and image of this fundraiser), Hiroki Otsuka (Pirontan) - a professional hentai manga artist with 21 manga volumes under his belt, Toshio Maeda - a master hentai artist, who, as the father of tentacle themes, needs no introduction, and others$2250 > Fiction. That's an average of $150 for each story x 15.$250 > PDF and other publishing software.$1500 > For incidentals I cannot yet comprehend. This is, granted, a buffer, but without it, I believe I may be making the mistake of . IF this money is not needed in-full for the first three issues, it will be put toward future issues and I will offer up a further perk to all parties (which will be announced once the the campaign period is over).

<h3>Joe's Story</h3>Joe moved to Los Angeles 6 years ago with a Nissan full of his stuff and a dream. To make people laugh. Over the years he has written for some web series, his friends who do stand up comedy and even sketch. All that time it was for someone else, never for himself. Now the Strait Jacket society has come calling and has asked Joe to join and be a part of their sketch shows, writing sketches that HE will perform in. Sketches that he will be the owner of! Joe is already hard at work writing new sketches for his first show which should debut sometime in May! To help pay for the theater and everything involved in producing live sketch comedy, every member of SJS is required to pay a one time fee of $250. So Joe could be there for 10 years and write and perform in hundreds of shows and he only has to pay this fee once.  thsi is where you can help make his dream a reality<br/><br/>
</div><div>

<h3>Donate and help Joe reach his goal!</h3>All Joe needs is $250 dollars! That means if 250 of you donate one dollar, He is there! Everyone donating $1, $5, $10 or $20 will get all the info on when the show is going to happen AND Joe's sincere gratitude. Anyone Donating $50 or more gets a free ticket to one of the shows being performed here in Hollywood, CA. Its up to you how you get here, but if you request a specific Thursday to go see it, Joe will do his best to make sure you get a ticket for that date! And all of you can feel good knowing you helped someone reach the next level of their career! Help Joe spread the laughter, people! <br/><br/><p><br/></p>

all backgrounds will see a version of the hero archetype rarely shown, that of
a proud, confident black lone hero and not the comic relief sidekick so often

kids will learn tolerance and open mindedness to new cultures and different
people. And learn that it can be fun to get know the unknown!</p>
<p><b>Why

<p>I have been called everything from the pied piper of cats to the crazy cat lady which is kind of odd being that I am too hairy to look good in a dress. Cats have been a part of my life since birth and I have volunteered at humane societies in every market I have worked.  I am also a life member of the Doris Day Animal League.</p>
<p>Currently, I have three cats at home. All are rescues. Two came from Austin. One came from Lawrence. His name is Jett and he is incredibly special. We adopted him at the age of 12 and he is a very healthy, active 14 year old now. Lawrencians who have frequented downtown Lawrence seem to recognize Jett as the black cat with the rip in his ear that used to roam the streets of downtown.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, I have heard many stories about the downtown cat and his adventures. I decided to turn these stories and a few from my own vivid imagination into a book for children. The book is designed to do two things: introduce children to the wonderful world of downtown Lawrence Kansas and also help overcome image problems associated with black cats.</p>
<p>After I wrote the book, I was fortunate enough to be introduced to Samantha Nowak who is an amazing illustrator. She has brought Jett and his story to life on these pages.</p>
<p>Our goal now is to take our finished product and have it printed so that the children of Lawrence can experience the joy of Jett.

<h3><b>What we’ve done</b></h3>
<p>In August 2014 we set out to connect with writers,
photographers, artists and inspirational individuals who would fill the pages
of our first issue. Along the way we set up a website that showcases selected
features from our team, both from the current issue and from online exclusives. We also finished designing our self-titled first issue, 152 pages of quality and creativity
that is ready to go to print once we raise the funds. </p>
<p>We now have over 60 people signed up who are either already
involved or soon to be involved in future issues and 7+ independent shops committed to selling our magazine. These people make up our
global SOMEDAY community. Another part of this network is all those connecting
with us on social media, primarily through Instagram, Twitter &amp; Facebook. The
response that we’ve received has been super encouraging and has shown that there
really is a market for this type of community-driven magazine.</p>

<p>Journalist, programledare i radio och på tv, musikälskare.</p>
<p>Det började med en bok som måste skrivas och som nästan skrev sig själv. Landskap utan karta handlar om hur det var att bli övergiven som 5-åring och om att växa upp med svårt psykiskt sjuka och frireligiösa farföräldrar. Om övergrepp i en idyll som ur en saga av Astrid Lindgren.  Andra delen; Äggskal handlar om en tonårstid mitt under punken men där de vuxna i sitt eget självförverkligande svek och livet var oförutsägbart och förtvivlat. Men även fyllt av möten med kända musiker, galna konstnärssjälar och stora hjärtan.<br/></p>
<p>Tredje delen ; Ryggradens kurva, om saker så svåra och märkliga att man ibland inte kan förstå att de hänt en själv, om felval och vägar som aldrig borde beträtts. Om varför man som 20-åring inte bör starta en rockklubb med artister som The Cult och Attentat som affischnamn.Om varför en kärlekslös barndom kan läkas av egna barn, men aldrig helt. Och hur man kan gå vidare där det inte ens finns en stig att följa, bara mörker och snår. </p>
<p>Tillsammans blir dessa tre böcker en helhet som känns lika angelägen som tidlös.</p>
<p>Inte en självhjälpsbok, snarare en ""du är aldrig ensam-bok"".</p>

<h3>Short Summary<br/>
</h3>
<p>Alexander Tate and Kirby Bristow are grudgingly symbiotic college roommates brought together by his girlfriend, who leaves them to deal with apartment payments and each other. They have more than money troubles to worry about, though. Alex is telepathic and suffers from prophetic dreams in a world where the supernatural is unwelcome. Kirby hates it when he pokes around in her thoughts, but she sticks around because he’s agreed to pay all the bills in exchange for her keeping his secret. Things get serious when Alex tells Kirby about a dream he had, one involving a murder on campus. When the dream comes true, they try to harness his “gifts” in the hope of catching the killer.<br/></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>A dear friend of mine, Norman Ringel, passed away in May of this year.

A dear friend of mine, Norman Ringel, passed away in May of this year. Before his departure from this world, one of his prime concerns was how his eight year old nephew was going to cope with his death. I personally researched children's books on the subject of loss and found very few options. And so, the story of ""Rafa the Robot"" was born. I wrote the story while Norman was in the hospital, and although I wanted to get it illustrated and printed within days, I knew that such a deadline was completely unrealistic! So, here I am, three months later, making that wish come true. 


The Impact
My intention is that this book will be a help to parents and or professionals who are dealing with children who have lost a loved one -- whether it be a robot, pet, friend or family member. Death is difficult for adults to navigate and even more so for young children. 
All the funds raised here will go directly to the making of the book (100 copies). If I do not reach my campaign goal then I will cover the outstanding balance myself. The book is going to print even if we don't reach our fund-raising goal!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I am a poet trying to share my work with the world through self-publishing. My first collection, Chronicles of the Amazing Broken Girl, was originally published by Sunbury Press in Camp Hill, PA, and is currently out of print. I am going the route of self-publishing in order to save my creative rights and publish my art in the way it's supposed to be viewed by the world. </p>
<p>I am a manic bipolar woman and my poetry is my therapy. I reach out to anyone that I meet that suffers from, or knows someone that suffers from, any mental illness to let them know that they are not invisible and that they, too, can find a place in the world as I'm doing. </p>
<p>I have four collections of poetry and prose to print and this is not something that I can afford to do on my own. </p>
<p>Chronicles of the Amazing Broken Girl tells a story about a woman that uses poetry as healing after she suffers a traumatic heartbreak and a break in the routine that she's created for herself to live with her mental illness. </p>
<p>Bi-the-Way is a collection of poems that explores darkness, as anyone dealing with illness on a daily basis can relate to. Poetry is used to examine the relationship between the light and the dark and how difficult it can be to find a niche in what can be a very scary outside world. </p>
<p>Low Fat Love Poems shows the lighter side, as a poet drives for inspiration and finds it in new and interesting places. This is a collection of tributes, to myself and others, as I heal and look for the positive in my surroundings. </p>
<p>My fourth collection, Rubber Band Ball, is a memoir told in poetry and prose. It tells the story of a girl with a tumultuous upbringing, surrounded by alcoholism, drugs, abuse and mental illness. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>10% of all proceeds from book sales are going back into our local art community, with 5% going to York Arts (<a href=""http://www.yorkarts.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yorkarts.org</a>) and 5% going to The Parliament (<a href=""http://www.parliamentyork.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.parliamentyork.org</a>). This doesn't include free books given away by the author as part of the Donate 10 for a Free Book option. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All money raised will be used for book publications only. To print 100 copies of a 60-70 page book, the costs are approximately $375.00, with $100 of that used to purchase an ISBN number unique to each book (as required by law) and $275.00 used for printing and shipping. I will be printing one book at a time as I raise money, so every dollar will be used for this. For example, If I meet half of the goal, 2 of the 4 books will be printed and available for sale. </p>
<p>Books will be sold for $10.00 per book, with discounted rates for multiple book purchases (1 for 10, 2 for 15, 3 for 20 and all 4 for 25). The discounted rates will help the books be promoted both by the author and by other local artists. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>National Novel Writing Month</h3>
<p>Every November, hundreds of Bloomington, Indiana writers take on NaNoWriMo’s challenge of writing a 50,000-word novel in thirty days. It’s an anti-contest writing contest, where the judges are missing, the prizes are lousy, and writers and non-writers alike have the time of their lives bashing out surprisingly unhorrible books in an absurdly short amount of time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>More and more writers undertaking this (not-so) death defying writing challenge in Bloomington every year.  A key part of NaNoWriMo is the chance to meet and write with other writers.</p>
<p>Most crucially, we need space to write and get together.  This usually costs money in some form, whether it's to rent the space itself, or to buy enough from the business that is graciously loaning us their space to thank them and keep their employees happy.</p>
<p>Typical writer things, like drinking too much coffee and forgetting to eat, are magnified in an intense month-long writing marathon.  I'd love to be able to offer participants snacks at the write ins, and possibly even prizes to award them for this huge accomplishment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We've got some awesome writers in Bloomington!  We want you to get a sample for yourselves.  To thank you for your generous contribution, we'd like to share our work with you.  Choose from books and ebooks written by our very own talented local authors.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spaces for write ins<br/>We need places to write!  Preferably, we'd like to have tables and chairs, power outlets, and a wifi connection, in a location safe and easily accessible (including parking) from both campus and downtown Bloomington.  Our write ins that we don't have locations for will be the first Friday, second Thursday, third Wednesday, fourth Tuesday, and last Monday of November, in the evening, approximately 6-9pm.  Depending on location, day, and time, in previous years we've had as many as 20 participants at time attending write-ins.</p>
<p>Food<br/>Snacks and drinks at write ins are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Prizes<br/>The only guaranteed prize for meeting the 50,000 word mark in November is a sense of accomplishment.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I believe in giving back. I believe in sharing and encouraging one another to make positive changes in order to lead better lives. I believe that at the very least we should inspire the youth of tomorrow and teach them to make sound choices and be bold when faced with adversity in life.  To achieve this we must give guidance to the future generations.</p>
<p>My dream is to share with the youth of today and tomorrow, the stories of the successful young leaders that I have interacted with.  </p>
<p>As a teenager in Jamaica I read a book that featured a man I considered my mentor from that moment on, Warren Buffet. After reading that book, I set goals for myself, which included inspiring young leaders to follow their dreams and make them a reality.</p>
<p>I decided to write this book because I realized there are such talented, smart and truly inspirational young leaders in different fields that do not get the recognition and the exposure they deserve! These people that I have had the opportunity to encounter have so many stories that they have shared and inspired me. I want to share them with others who otherwise would never get a chance to learn from these amazing people.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you are allowing others access to this elite group of people I call “Luminaries”, <span class=""ssens"">people of prominence and brilliant achievement</span>. You WILL help shape the lives of people from across the globe.</p>
<p>A book like this is missing in the market place. We are bombarded with information about a special group of athletes or those in the entertainment industry, be it singer, performers, or actors. While their successes are to be lauded and cheered and admired, we have an obligation to expose our future leaders to other role models, other mentors, other inspirational people doing wonderful things in different fields. Whether it be philanthropic, economic advancement, invention or business, these young leaders have paved the way for future generations. I believe that this book will enrich the lives of young people around the world.</p>
<p>You can make this happen for all the young men and women out there who need to find a mentor to help pave their way, just as I had a chance to read a book featuring Warren Buffet that helped pave my way.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Why we wrote this book</strong></p>
<p>As the world becomes more divided, we think it is important to try to connect with those around us. We want to build bridges using thought, help people truly get to know each other, and inspire new ideas. We also like feeling clever and writing a book is a great way to pat yourself on the back. </p>
<p><strong>A bit about the book</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this is a book but we hope that readers we will use it as a tool to reach new personal intellectual heights, have a mind-gasm, if you will. It is written in a stream of conscious style, each author expressing their thoughts on a subject briefly and posing questions, most of the time leaving the discussion open ended. It is up to the reader to either pick up these ideas and come to their own conclusion or to judge us as unworthy intellectual souls and move on to the next topic. </p>
<p><strong>Why you matter</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we need money to make our dream of publishing this book a reality. But we also need you as a reader, your thoughts and interactions are what make this vision become a reality. We need your intellect to further our, perhaps idealistic, goals.</p>

Basically, this gap in words is what early literacy experts refer to when describing the disparity between the number of words that children from families of disadvantaged economic backgrounds hear compared to children from families of more affluent economic backgrounds. Reading experts say that young children who <strong><u>hear new and interesting words</u></strong> are better prepared to succeed when they enter school. This exposure to words also promotes a desire to read books and awakens a love of language that helps children become stronger readers.</p><p>We promote the message that ALL parents, regardless of financial circumstance, are wealthy with words! They have the power to introduce their children to a variety of words because, for the most part, they already own these words in English and/or Spanish!  Poverty, inequity, and failing school systems are a sad reality communities face. Ending ‘word poverty” is not a panacea that will solve all of society’s injustices. However, through collective efforts that empower communities of high needs, disparities can be narrowed because families can obtain resources to create better learning experiences and opportunities for their children. And for us, we strongly believe that’s heading in the right direction.</p><h3>This project also addresses the need to increase the number of English/Spanish bilingual children’s books that are published by Latino authors.</h3><p>This is the first of four books in the  <i>Mommy Tell Me Series </i>that is co-authored by a Mother-Daughter Team.</p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509954506/ucxegnei5eijfafcldek.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p><h2><strong>About this Bilingual Picture Book:</strong></h2><p><i>Mommy, Tell Me Why I Am Radiant </i>is about a charming conversation between a mother and daughter regarding the little girl’s qualities that make her unique.  The positive words used in the text support little girls’ self-confidence and self-worth (and perhaps moms’ too!).

Un destino que le vino marcado por una joven hechizada y un muchacho que se rebeló contra todo lo que le habían enseñado.¿Logrará escapar Sadhila de su destino? Y lo que es mas importante... ¿querrá hacerlo?¿Tendrá este cuento de hadas un final feliz?

<h3>Why am I Raising These Funds?</h3>
<p>Bringing this story to the world is an expensive endeavor. The $50,000 goal I set will help cover the costs of not only printing the book, but also to spread the word about it. Travel costs, publicity, marketing and social media consultants, and operations all have astronomical costs. However, I believe it's well worth it to make sure every American knows what the government is doing behind closed doors. </p>
<p>It isn't so much a donation as it is buying the book early. But even if you can't get involved financially, please spread the word about the book, follow me on Twitter, or subscribe to my blog. I need ambassadors just as much as I need funds. People to get out there, buy the book, and to tell everyone about this story. </p>
<h3>More About the Story</h3>
<p>Small business owner Michael J. Daugherty is fighting back against US Government's sinister surveillance tactics with his upcoming book,<br/><strong>The Devil Inside the Beltway: The Shocking Expose of the US Government’s Surveillance and Overreach into Cybersecurity, Medicine, and Small Business</strong>.</p>
<p>During the past decade the US Government has teamed with private enterprise and academia to attack American small business by surveilling networks and picking up Americans’ files they considered to be “shared” and ""vulnerable"". They used that information to expand and grow more than one government agency. <img alt=""Blinking Book Cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/934413/pictures/full/20130717110723-BlinkingBookCoverSurvellience__1_.gif?1374084449"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""The Devil Inside the Beltway""/></p>
<p>Michael J. Daugherty, the small business owner who created LabMD, a cancer<br/>detection center in Atlanta, Georgia, became a victim of these governmental<br/>practices. What began with the unauthorized but government-funded procurement of medical data for 9000+ patients from his medical laboratory turned into a government supported, financially draining, extortion attempt.</p>
<p>This enterprise, in association with a prestigious American university, conducted an illegal conversion of medical files and then used their findings to motivate the US Government to ride the wave of cybersecurity investigations and witchhunts. </p>
<p>Through acts of conversion, then extortion, the government, in this case specifically the FTC, is trying to control the Internet and cybersecurity through illegal methods, without standards, stretching laws way past their intent. This is textbook government practice--overreaching now, asking for forgiveness later, and hoping we all will forget.</p>
<p>Daugherty started writing this book long before the scandals involving the NSA, IRS, the Associated Press, James Rosen, and Benghazi became household discussions. He has engaged in an exhaustive effort to protect his company, one that saves lives, to repair and protect his reputation, and to ensure that this does not happen to any other American citizen, business, or media outlet.</p>
<p>Taking you inside his five-year journey of government power grabs and intimidation tactics, Daugherty backs his riveting true story with engaging detail, including Congressional testimony, press releases, e-mails, letters and FOIA documents. But for the fact that everything in the book really happened, it reads like a brilliant political thriller. The cronies, lawyers, politicians and bullies...they are all right here in this stinging indictment.<br/><br/></p></span></div>","THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN CANCELED.

And we wanted to talk with the authors. Memoir writing is a

We have an essay each issue written by a writer engaged in some

This has proved to be an exciting feature, and has drawn submissions from

I want nothing more than for girls to see what they can become, and I believe this needs to happen at a very young age.

--(Breakdown of funds requested & why is below!)About the Book:Little girls can't be what they can't see. I've searched the internet to find a single children's book that depicts a grownup female president of the United States (as well as a first gentleman), and have been extremely hard pressed to find one among the endless pool of princess and fairy tale books.My goal is to create a children's book titled 'Madam President,' that depicts a day in the life of the President, who is a strong and intelligent woman, and who is also a loving and dedicated mother and wife. I want nothing more than for girls to see what they can become, and I believe this needs to happen at a very young age.

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 10pt; font-family: trebuchet ms;"">From
a young age, Darren Chiacchia was struck by the dream of achieving Olympic

vigorously, with every ounce of diligence, grit, passion, and perseverance he
can muster. He initiates a rigorous regimen, boldly forging opportunities in
the equestrian world, and rising to the top. Through his efforts, Darrren
excels at the sport, becoming a master Equestrian with unprecedented feats.

<p style=""font-family: trebuchet ms;"">Darren now uses his past challenges as fuel for greater life purpose. Following his accident, he achieves the remarkable feat of rising to the top again as an Equestrian, with his vision set on representing his country in international competitions. But he has done more than that. Not only has he returned to being a top competitor, he is also bringing more light to the relevant subject of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). TBI is gaining increased awareness in our society, due to the number of athletes suffering from varying degrees of brain injury, coupled with the tremendous number of injured veterans returning from the war overseas. The book will address the traumatic impact on both TBI victims and their families. Darren brings forward an awareness of how the entire family suffers from this injury; and offers guidance through these challenges. Darren is becoming increasingly involved in programs of awareness, education, and support for victims of TBI, and their families.<br/></p>
<p style=""font-family: trebuchet ms;"">Darren's teen years of discovering and embracing his homosexuality also address issues of gay awareness, and teen bullying- both extremely relevant issues today.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name's Jen [hi!] and I'm a writer and bookseller living in London, UK. I also have <a href=""http://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=en&amp;Expert=1896"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EEC Syndrome</a>, which is a rare form of <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002440/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ectodermal Dysplasia</a>. New research has shown that, due to a fault in the p63 gene, people with EEC Syndrome can suffer progressive sight loss because of their corneas reproducing incorrectly. At the moment there is no cure for this. I wrote a blog post about me being told this recently <a href=""http://jen-campbell.blogspot.com/2011/08/what-i-talk-about-when-i-dont-know.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">over here</a>. So, I'm doing a fundraising event to raise money for the research centres who are looking for a cure, and who are are also doing research into better understanding and helping out in other areas affected by EEC Syndrome.</p>
<br/><h3>What I'm Doing</h3>
I'm writing 100 poems in just one weekend: <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">5th &amp; 6th November</span>. I'll be posting them online as I write them over at <a href=""http://100poemweekend.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">100poemweekend.blogspot.com</a>. On the run up to this weekend, I'm asking people to give me tag words. You can suggest one by dropping me an email [link over on my blog], or tweeting me <a href=""http://twitter.com/aeroplanegirl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@aeroplanegirl</a>.

Hello!
My name's Jen [hi!] and I'm a writer and bookseller living in London, UK. I also have EEC Syndrome, which is a rare form of Ectodermal Dysplasia. New research has shown that, due to a fault in the p63 gene, people with EEC Syndrome can suffer progressive sight loss because of their corneas reproducing incorrectly. At the moment there is no cure for this. I wrote a blog post about me being told this recently over here. So, I'm doing a fundraising event to raise money for the research centres who are looking for a cure, and who are are also doing research into better understanding and helping out in other areas affected by EEC Syndrome.
What I'm Doing
I'm writing 100 poems in just one weekend: 5th & 6th November. I'll be posting them online as I write them over at 100poemweekend.blogspot.com. On the run up to this weekend, I'm asking people to give me tag words. You can suggest one by dropping me an email [link over on my blog], or tweeting me @aeroplanegirl. Each of the poems will be inspired by a tag word, and the person who gave me that tag word will be credited within the blog post. [Previous to this challenge, I've had poems published in places like The Rialto, Poetry London, The Interpreter's House and Agenda. You can read some of those, over here.]

<p><strong>Hello sweet ones!</strong></p>
<p>This is a fundraiser for my first ever book, Overflow: Tales of Butch-Femme!  It is a collection of short, erotic fiction written over the course of the last seven years that I'm self-publishing through Lulu.com.  These are stories I felt compelled to tell, that speak to my desire and the way I move through the world in a way that I don't often find in the ""lesbian erotica"" genre.  I wrote from a place of what I know and the marginality that I live with, so many of my characters are rural, working class, from a sub-cultural background, wired on the BDSM spectrum, curvy/fat, and dealing with intense emotional realities.  Okay, so there's also a fairy-tale in there, which is not as much from my lived perspective!</p>
<p>Here is a write up for Lulu, and some advanced praise:</p>
<p>Overflow is equal parts sweet romance and a kinky, smut-filled good time. Between its covers you will find eleven stories delving into the world of butch-femme love, sex, and power dynamics. These stories are raw and vulnerable, exploring the tenderness and brutality of BDSM sex, as well as the emotional healing possible. Sacchi Green says: “Miel Rose writes with passion and intensity from deep within the world of femmes and butches. Her fiction blends strength with vulnerability, raw sex with sensitivity, and pain with joy, depicted with both earthy realism and strikingly original lyricism. My personal favorite, perhaps because it was included in my anthology Lesbian Lust, is “August Crazies,” where Miel depicts the bdsm world of power exchange in scorching detail, at the same time illuminating the underlying complexities and desires with tenderness and no less heat. Each of these pieces offers fully-realized characters, evocative settings, and down-and-deliriously-dirty sex, and all of them stir both flesh and spirit.” </p>
<p><strong>Lulu/what are we doing here</strong></p>
<p>So, for those of you who don't know, Lulu is a website that helps you self-publish and prints your book to order.  This means that you don't need to order a huge amount to be printed in one go, which is great!  It does mean that I have to pay about $8 plus shipping for each copy of my book that I want to either give to folks who helped out or have on hand for readings.  I'm hoping to fundraise some extra moola to cover the cost of 50 books plus shipping for these purposes, and get the book out to all you lovelies at the same time!  If by any chance extra is raised, then more books will be purchased and/or it will help me with travel costs to do readings farther afield. </p>
<p><strong>Perk it up</strong></p>
<p>So the main perk is the book, of course.  </p>
<p>There is a $5 option for sweethearts who want to help out, but are low on funds or pervy butch-femme smut isn't their thing.  For that I will thank you profusely in a hand-made card.</p>
<p>Just added: now you have the option of getting the book for a $20 donation!  $25 also get you a 3 card set of my lovely and powerful sister's greeting cards!</p>
<p>For $50 and $100 donations, you will receive books as well as a hand embroidered hankie art piece by yours truly.  They take me between 3 and 8 hours to make and when I sell them they're priced between $30 and $80.  They are also smokingly hot, if I do say so myself.  Folks who chose this perk will receive their books by the end of February, but the hankies may be more like April.</p>
<p><strong>Help of another kind</strong></p>
<p>As with any other funding campaign, spreading the word is essential and so appreciated!  Please post on social networking sites, and if there are particular folks you know who would be interested, let them know about this project!</p>

<h3>Testimonial From Fearless Books Publishing...<em><br/></em>
</h3>
<p><em>""Dear Rob,</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks for the opportunity to read and assess the working draft of ENLIGHTENMENT EVERYONE. Your idea for a fellowship of those seeking enlightenment, based on Twelve Step programs, is original, intriguing, and beautifully fits the principals and ideals you profess. Your idea of offering readers supplementary guidance in the form of music to listen to, books to read, and movies to watch is creative, and could work extremely well. We feel most readers will enjoy the experience of listening to music, doing additional readings, and watching movies as ways to learn and understand your teaching – we enjoyed this ourselves. Your project has the potential to be quite useful to those seeking enlightenment. We commend you on your significant efforts thus far and on your noble ambition.""</em></p>
<p>- Sari Friedman and D. Patrick Miller, Fearless Books</p>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Thanks everyone for considering this campaign! My name is Rob Bundschu. About 12 years ago, I was living through a very challenging period of my life. I was drinking <em>way</em> too much and smiling way too little, and was still recovering from a severe personal crisis which had occurred several years prior. Thankfully, I reached a point where I had had ""enough"", and saught help. It was about then that I decided to travel to Florida and check into an addictions treatment facility. Soon after, I would be introduced to a 12 Step recovery program.</p>
<p>After following the program successfully for 5+ years, in particular working the 12 Steps, I had such a profound experience of happiness, healing and forgiveness for both myself and all my loved ones, that the idea occured to me that <em>everyone</em> could benefit from a Step recovery program, not just addicts.</p>
<p>Thus the idea for the book and program of Enlightenment Everyone was born.</p>
<h3>What is Enlighenment Everyone?</h3>
<p>Enlightenment Everyone is a new 13 Step program which I was inspired to create in order to help people achieve true happiness and peace. Although it is modeled after other 12 step programs, it is something entirely different. While other step programs seek to help people overcome an addiction to a particular substance or habit, Enlightenment Everyone is intended to help people overcome suffering altogether - or to achieve enlightenment. I've come to understand it <em>is</em> doable! The 13 steps will do this by gently guiding a person toward finding their own unique spiritual path, which will help them remove all the blocks to love within themselves.</p>
<p>Enlightenment Everyone is not a new religion or a cult. It is simply a new book/organization that has been formed in order to help people who want it to find peace in a world where peace seems to have no home.</p>
<p>Of course, I understand this new program will not be for everyone, but I believe there are a significant number of people today who are ready and willing to be a part of a program like Enlightenment Everyone.</p>
<h3>About the Enlightenment Everyone Campaign</h3>
<p>The world today seems to be out of control, scary, and uncertain. Turn on the news and we are bombarded with violence, scandal, and disillusionment. With volitile economies and governenments becoming less and less reliable, many of us are searching for a place or state of mind where there is comfort and certainty and peace.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help fund the publication of the main textbook that will be used in the Enlightenment Everyone program. I have contributed much in terms of time and money to this project, but I need a little more help to get it done. I need your help to finish this project!</p>
<h3>Where Enlightenment Everyone is today...</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After 3 years of writing and preparation, there is now a completed unedited manuscript</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hired Fearless Books and payed over $1000 to have the manuscript assessed professionally. As the quote above suggests, they feel the manuscript is worthy and has potential, but needs further development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enlightenment Everyone meetings began in late 2012! We meet for an hour every Monday. There are only two offical EE members at this moment. Many worthy projects have started with two, including the original 12 Step recovery program and the creation of A Course in Miracles.</p>
</li>
<li>The book is inteneded as a Self-published work, and will the be published under the label 'New Ordered World'.</li>
<li>When the time is right, I intend to create an offical non-profit organization under the name ""Enlightenment Everyone"".</li>

<p>Dear Friends &amp; Family,</p>
<p>This project has been the central focus of my life for the past five years, never leaving my mind for long during my normal daily living. I have faith that it has the potential to help many people find a way to greater peace and happiness in their lives. I know many of you are happy with your lives, and may not have any desire for or need for a program like EE. But I believe that many people out there <em>are</em> looking for something like Enlightenment Everyone, even if they are not aware of it.</p>
<p>Certainly there was a time when I ""knew"" I had no need for a Step program or anything like it. Yet in deep gratitude, I would learn I didn't really know what I needed. And fate and circumstances led me to a Step program, which had a profound positive impact on my life. And I've seen these programs have profound impacts on many others lives as well.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to consider making a contribution. Any contribution you can make will be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>For years, AirSafe.com has provided the traveling public with vital information about confusing and inconsistent security rules, poor inflight airline service, lost baggage, mystery fees and other things that frustrate and inconvenience air travelers. But because this information is available exclusively online, it is often out of reach just when you need it most...</p>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>An airline damaged your luggage, and you want to make sure that you ask the right questions and get the right paperwork filled out.</li>
<li>The gate agent announces your flight is cancelled, and you need to book an alternate flight quickly.</li>
<li>On the way to the airport, you realize you left your driver's license at home, and you need to know what alternative IDs the TSA will accept.</li>
<li>A TSA agent is conducting what you think is an inappropriate search, and you don't know how to respond to the situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these situations are covered by AirSafe.com, but if you can't get online, our information won't help you. If you had the information in your smartphone or your tablet device, you could find out what you need to know quickly.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong>: AirSafe.com plans to take the best of its online information and put it into a series of ebooks that anyone can download for free and keep on hand at all times. A traveler in trouble just turns on a smartphone and all the information he or she needs is available in an instant.</p>
<p>This is a solution that's based on a proven concept. Last year, AirSafe.com published the ebook AirSafe.com Baggage and Security Guide, and it was quite popular, with over 10,000 downloads in the first six months. This new series of ebooks will be much more useful, covering issues that are of great concern to literally millions of flyers.</p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong>: The goal of the project is to use the insights gained from running AirSafe.com to create several ebooks, each of which covers a specific area of common air traveler concerns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Airline Complaints Do's and Don'ts - Will cover the basic rules and requirements that passengers must follow when they file a complaint against an airline, airport, or government agency.</li>
<li>Travel with Children - Will include many of the common concerns parents face when flying with infants or children, plus key information for parents whose children need to fly when unaccompanied. Plus a review of the pros and cons of child safety seats.</li>
<li>Dealing with common travel issues - This ebook will give very practical advice on how to deal with problems like lost bags, cancelled flights, air rage, and inappropriate behavior by security personnel.</li>
<li>Once all three ebooks are completed, a fourth one containing all the content from the first three ebooks will also be published.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How the Money Will Be Used</strong>: This project seeks to collect $5,000, and all of the money will be used for professional services such as editing and ebook formatting, in order to ensure that the products will work with all popular ebook devices and smartphones, including the Kindle, Nook, iPad, and iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing and Distribution</strong>: This project will use the same network of web sites, podcasts, mailing lists, and other marketing tools used to promote last year's successful ebook. Like the first ebook, the new ebooks will be available as free downloads from sites in the AirSafe.com network.</p>
<p><strong>Project Managemen</strong>t: The author of all of these ebooks, Dr. Todd Curtis, has been a published author since 2000, and has managed the publication of several books.</p>
<p><strong>Project Timeline</strong>: Once funded, a new ebook would be available about every six weeks, with the first one published by August 2012 and the final one available in November before the holiday travel season.</p>
<p><strong>About AirSafe.com</strong> <br/>Since 1996, AirSafe.com has provided airline passengers and airline professionals with insights on airline issues from baggage and customer  service to safety and security. In recent years the site has focused on providing passengers with information and advice that  allow them to deal with many of the most common air travel hassles. </p>

All of these situations are covered by AirSafe.com, but if you can't get online, our information won't help you. If you had the information in your smartphone or your tablet device, you could find out what you need to know quickly.
The Solution: AirSafe.com plans to take the best of its online information and put it into a series of ebooks that anyone can download for free and keep on hand at all times. A traveler in trouble just turns on a smartphone and all the information he or she needs is available in an instant.
This is a solution that's based on a proven concept. Last year, AirSafe.com published the ebook AirSafe.com Baggage and Security Guide, and it was quite popular, with over 10,000 downloads in the first six months. This new series of ebooks will be much more useful, covering issues that are of great concern to literally millions of flyers.
The Project: The goal of the project is to use the insights gained from running AirSafe.com to create several ebooks, each of which covers a specific area of common air traveler concerns:

Airline Complaints Do's and Don'ts - Will cover the basic rules and requirements that passengers must follow when they file a complaint against an airline, airport, or government agency.
Travel with Children - Will include many of the common concerns parents face when flying with infants or children, plus key information for parents whose children need to fly when unaccompanied. Plus a review of the pros and cons of child safety seats.
Dealing with common travel issues - This ebook will give very practical advice on how to deal with problems like lost bags, cancelled flights, air rage, and inappropriate behavior by security personnel.
Once all three ebooks are completed, a fourth one containing all the content from the first three ebooks will also be published.

How the Money Will Be Used: This project seeks to collect $5,000, and all of the money will be used for professional services such as editing and ebook formatting, in order to ensure that the products will work with all popular ebook devices and smartphones, including the Kindle, Nook, iPad, and iPhone.
Marketing and Distribution: This project will use the same network of web sites, podcasts, mailing lists, and other marketing tools used to promote last year's successful ebook. Like the first ebook, the new ebooks will be available as free downloads from sites in the AirSafe.com network.
Project Management: The author of all of these ebooks, Dr. Todd Curtis, has been a published author since 2000, and has managed the publication of several books.
Project Timeline: Once funded, a new ebook would be available about every six weeks, with the first one published by August 2012 and the final one available in November before the holiday travel season.
About AirSafe.com Since 1996, AirSafe.com has provided airline passengers and airline professionals with insights on airline issues from baggage and customer  service to safety and security. In recent years the site has focused on providing passengers with information and advice that  allow them to deal with many of the most common air travel hassles.

Our mission, as stated before, is to serve God, help others, and grow together. Our goal is to bring awareness of ministries and non-profit work done by people that elevates others out of despair into hope, happiness, and fulfillment of purpose. We are not interested in discussion on denominational differences. Or differences in religious practices. We are solely concerned with the primary message sent by God.That message:Our job is NOT to judge,Our job is NOT to decide who is deserving,Our job IS                lift the fallen                restore the broken                encourage the weary                feed the hungryMagazine in Motion Elevate Magazine believes in giving back. To date, the creative team behind Elevate has sponsored the 2016 5th Annual Prayer Walk in Ocala, been a Gold Sponsor of the 2017 Habitat for Humanity of Marion County Strawberry Festival, and assisted collaborator U.N.I.T.Y Services Group distribute 15,000 lbs of food at Evergreen Elementary in Ocala.

Make a Statement Having Elevate or Elevar print magazine laying on your desk, or prominently displayed in your reception area will connect with your visitors.
It’s a conversation starter about faith-based ideals and action you find important.
It’s an artform, lost when displayed from a screen.
It says that even though you are part of the fast-paced world of digital, there is still a part of you that likes the feel of printed pages, and the look of images on a page.

For their complete biographies, visit our website: http://elevatemagazine.us/?page_id=235We Need Your ParticipationTalent alone will not produce a magazine. We need to build a fellowship of  community supporters, who assist with story ideas and  financial contributions. Your financial contributions will go toward printing costs, paying our graphic designers, writers, and photographers, as well as our outreach director and other staff. We need drivers to deliver the magazines, an accountant to manage the budget, software programs to develop the magazine, and an expense budget to go out into the community and gather the stories important to you.Cost Breakdown The $30,000 will be used to pay the following:Independent contractors who provided content = $10,000Printing ($9,000 for Elevate, $3,000 for Elevar) = $12,000Shipping = $250Indiegogo fees (services + processing at 8.5% of $30,000) = $2,500Distribution of magazine copies = $1,000Additional graphic design for any ads that come in = $400The following are additional costs to operate Elevate and Elevar as quarterly magazines:Insurance (Errors & Omissions) = $750CEP membership (annual) = $600Accountant = $2,500Total = $30,000To publish a digital magazine only, we would need to only cover the independent contractors who provided content: designers, photographer, writers ($10,000) + Indiegogo fees of $11,000 ($935) = $10,935Since Indiegogo offers a flexible plan, we can raise $11,000, not $30,000 and still have something to publish, so that all the hard work done over an entire year is not lost. The work of those over the year include: our designers: Joe Deleon, Amber Laudicina, and Ashley Burdeshaw; photographer Conan Segrest; copy editor, Nicole Gomez; and our writers: Michelle Clark, Jarod Kintz, Trisha Hiatt, and Lisa Rios. Plus Crystal Jewell-Maksou, who served as our outreach director.NO PROFIT is being made by the publisher to launch this magazine or by the crowdfunding campaign. John Sotomayor has stated it publicly he is motivated to do this to glorify God. To him, this is a labor of love. Please help us get the work they helped produce published, at least in digital magazine format, so that their efforts are not wasted, and Elevate and Elevar magazines could be launched, so once seen by the public in mass, it may have a fighting chance to succeed and take flight.To show our gratitude, we developed a series of perks based on participation level. It does not matter whether you contribute a little or a lot, every level counts, and is considered a part of the Elevate fellowship.",19.0,2,"1 Campaign

My name is Rachel and I’m a documentary photographer. Today, I'm putting myself on the assignment I've only been able to fantasize about until now. Two years ago sitting in my overpriced apartment in Southern California I was fed up with my obsessive fixation to my smartphone and laptop rather than the people in my community. I decided to downsize-- to remove the excess in my life to discover how to really connect in our overstimulating world today.
For two years I have been living on my 27ft sailboat in Marina Del Rey and relating to an overlooked community of ""off-gridders"" living just like me. My boat has been more than my alternative home but my inspiration for the project, Connected Off-the-Grid. 





I was asking myself, ""How do we strike a balance in our society today with the media manipulation and cost of living programming our everyday decisions? "" 




THE PROJECT

Connected Off-the-Grid  is a multimedia photo project that explores a collection of people living the new ""American Dream"", a population that is plugged in and out of society at the same time. 
For the past year I have used my camera and audio recorder to collect stories from numerous people giving up the chase of the old American Dream and finding happiness in living creatively. Giving up the ""McMansion"" or extra shoe closet seems like a sacrifice to most Americans, but these people have found a real balance to life. This select group of people are living smaller and bigger at the same time-- they are connected to humanity, nature, and the internet.

The people I am meeting...

Live in nature...





Use their laptops to look up astrological charts...






Invite friends over for dinner on their iPhones...

Brush their teeth on the water...


Plant mobile gardens on their rooftop van...

Dance at sunset next to the ocean... 

Sail their homes in their very own fleet...


And create their own wood shop next to their favorite marina...


THE JOURNEY



On August 1st, 2015  I will start by traveling all throughout California, off the beaten path through high dessert, national forests, city marinas, coastal and mountain towns in search of unseen fascinating stories. Each person I meet will be engaged in their chosen livelihood using recognizable technology in innovative situations and circumstances.






YOUR CONTRIBUTION


You will help me mark a time in history by recording the stories of Americans that are paving the way of our future. 



WHERE THE MONEY GOES


Since I will be leaving my job for two months to pursue a project that is my pure passion, I will be out of work for two months. My goal for this campaign is to raise $3,000 to make up for this lost income. The funds raised by the campaign will go towards the basics of the trip.


Gas: $600


Food: $1,000
Camera equipment and other gear : $700
Regular monthly expenses: $700

THE IMPACT

This project is valuable to the entire world because if we keep moving in the direction we are we could ruin our planet and lose connection with each other. It's getting harder for anyone following their passions to afford the living expenses we are faced with today. If we educate ourselves on alternative ways of living we can see the possibilities that exist to have a balanced life in today's society.
Like with The Mirror, Mirror Project ( http://www.themirrormirrorproject.com/ ) and work from my other series', Homeless with Technology  (http://www.rachelbujalski.com/), my goal is for all people, no matter their background, to appreciate our differences and see that we are all one and the same at the basic core. This project shows the reality of people living small, staying connected to their beliefs and each other, and shows us how we don't need the excess material items to be happy. 



THE BOOK AND EXHIBIT


Upon my return from my trip, I will have enough material for a full multimedia exhibition complete with photographs and audio interviews. These works will also be included in a book titled, Connected Off-the-Grid. 

    
Risks & Challenges
Living out of my Toyota Corolla for two months will definitely be a challenge as it is slightly more compact than my boat. My boat has definitely prepared me for this journey but this will be a completely new experience for me.

<p><i>From Hugh Hayes, the author:</i></p>
<p>Hi. My name is Hugh Hayes. The Friends of Finsbury Park are celebrating the 150th anniversary of the opening of Finsbury Park this summer. As part of the celebrations they’ve asked me to update the history of the park that I wrote nearly 20 years ago. This new version will come right up to the present day and be 16 pages longer. It will include more about Hornsey Wood House that was pulled down to make way for the park, more about the reservoir under the park, details about the 6 million pounds spent on the park in the 00s, and all the famous people who have visited the park from Sylvia Pankhust to Bob Dylan. Parks are such important places, and Finsbury Park with its amazing history is a very special place visited by over a million people every year. So please help the Friends celebrate the anniversary, and pre-book your copy of my revised book A Park for Finsbury. As before, there will be a limited print, and the first edition is no longer available, so grab your copy now. Any profits from the sale of the book will go to the Friends of Finsbury Park which is a registered charity. Thanking you in advance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need to raise over £8,000 to cover the writing, design, print and editing costs of the book. We've already been able to raise about half of that money through grants and offers from generous individuals. However, we're still several thousand short and so I'm seeking your help to cover our editing and printing costs so that we can get the book to print in time for the 150th anniversary of the park in August. We're therefore giving you the chance to pre-order copies of the book, so that you'll be the first to get it once it's off the press! </p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-order a copy of the book for just £10, including free UK delivery;</li>
<li>Pre-order a signed copy of the book, and get a ticket to the book launch in August for £15;</li>
<li>If you're kind enough to support us generously by giving £50, we'll include your name in the acknowledgements section of the book, and you'll get three signed copies and two tickets to the book launch.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>We really hope we can make our £2,000 initial target towards funding this book. However, if we don't make that target, meaning we can't fund the book, all donors will be refunded, so your money will not be going to waste. If we do make our target, the money raised will be passed on to the Friends of Finsbury Park, which will be used to help cover print and editing costs.</p>
<p><strong>What's going in the book?</strong></p>
<p>Amongst many other new additions, there will be further images of Horsey Wood House as it changed through the 18th and 19th Century, until it was pulled down to make way for the Park and new theories about who it was who dug out the lake in the late 18th century.  There will be new memories about the Park, including the Black Shirt’s demonstration in the park in the 1930’s, and the “speakers Corner”. There will be images of the reservoir and of the old café, details of where the bombs landed in the second World War, the £600000 spent on the park in the noughties and the fight by the Friends to have the income derived from leasing the Park by Haringey Council to be spent on the Park. All profits will go to the Friends of Finsbury Park which is a registered charity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're grateful for every pre-order of the book you make, but we also need to get the word out to as many people as possible, so please do consider tell your friends and neighbours, and sharing our campaign to social media. </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is my first book and first crowdfunding campaign. The fact that I'm doing this is a giant step for me and wouldn't be possible if I hadn't done some difficult work, this year, to break through barriers that had been holding me back for many years. I'm excited about the future, now, and getting all of my various creative projects moving forward. Thank you for helping me to get the ball rolling and publish my first book! All sales revenue will go back to my contributors until they are paid back in full, so this is really just a loan!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am doing all of the layout of the pages, myself, but need to raise at least $2,500 to pay the artist for illustrations and an additional $2,500 to pay for printing and delivery of books to supporters and retailers. Anything over the $5,000 I seek will go toward the marketing of the book and the recording of my companion song, ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Trump."" All revenue comes back to you, so it's really just a loan.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>During dark times such these, it is important to create art that helps people to deal with the daily onslaught of bad news by lightening things up and giving them something to laugh about. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to be able to get this book out in time for the holiday shopping season, but need to move quickly, which is why I need your help.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>Beyond the Halls: An Insider’s Guide to Loving Museums</i> includes a brief history of museums and explores the present nature of these institutions, while providing thought-provoking ways to interact with them. <br/><br/>My name is Mackenzie Finklea and I am the author of Beyond the Halls. What's missing out there in the world right now is a book about museums for people not in the industry. I want to write something compelling that even my best engineering friend would want to read because they're interested, and not out of friendly obligation. I want this to be something that any museum, big or small, historical or scientific, would want to put in their gift shop. More importantly, I seek to change the way people think about and experience museums.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will find something that interests you. You can open the book to any section, and find something tailored to your unique personality and background. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for museums in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you have more memorable experiences inside museums, and more thought provoking discussions beyond the halls.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the history of museums and their current fight to thrive in the tourism industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stories about my personal museum adventures.</li>
<li>Thought-provoking questions and interactive exercises.</li>
<li>Fascinating histories of individuals and institutions in the industry.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are a museum professional or enthusiast. You will also love this book even if you hate museums or never go to them. <br/><br/><i>Beyond the Halls</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to museum lovers and haters alike who are looking at discovering the history of museums and dynamic nature of the industry for the first time.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - Beyond the Halls: An Insider’s Guide to Loving Museums</h3>This book addresses three main topics; the history of museums, the present challenges, and future possibilities. In order to cater to several unique types of people that might read this book, the book is written in 7 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong>, the Novice, contains Chapters 1-5. Part 1 explores what museums are and introduces ways for the museum novice to interact with them.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong>, the Historian, contains Chapters 6-10. You’ll find an introduction to various types of museums, what they are and how they came to be the respected, and the cultural phenomenon they are today.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong>, the Curator, contains Chapters 11-14. Curators already have gone through a great deal of formal schooling to be experts in their field. Part 3 seeks to provide a fresh perspective on curatorial practices and ideals.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong>, the Skeptic, contains Chapters 15-19. If you’re hesitant to buy into or hate museums, part 4 is for you. Part 4 takes an honest look at why museums exist and why they even matter. Museums are vibrant and exciting places for learning and, believe it or not, fun; now more than ever.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5</strong>, the Businessman, contains Chapters 20-22. At the end of the day, museums are a business: many of them are not for profit. They live and die in the tourism industry. Part 5 examines the current state of museums as they struggle to compete in their market.<br/><br/><strong>Part 6</strong>, the Activist, contains Chapters 23-26. Museums have a bit of a troubled history, but museums in the contemporary world are making changes to be more inclusive and culturally conscious. For the ones that aren’t, that’s where the activist comes in.<br/><br/><strong>Part 7</strong>, the Enthusiast, contains Chapters 27 and 28. Finally, the book ends with notes about my personal experience with and enthusiasm for museums. I am already on the museum-loving bandwagon, and I want you to join me.<h3> </h3>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Mackenzie Finklea is an American Anthropologist and life-long museum enthusiast. She is a young professional who graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology, a minor in Architecture, and a certificate in Museum Studies. She was recently hired at the Bryan Museum in Galveston, Texas in the summer of 2019. In April of 2019, she was invited to speak at the TEDx conference at UT Austin about her research on Internet Memes and cyberculture. She has a long history of previous leadership roles and a vibrant fascination with displays of human culture.<br/><br/>Mackenzie wrote this book because she believes that museums are special part of human culture. She finds the ways that people display their lives fascinating and enriching to her life. Everywhere she goes, and every time she travels, Mackenzie finds herself off the beaten path and fully immersing herself in the local culture as well as visiting as many museums as possible along the way. Mackenzie wants people to cherish and admire museums as much as she does.<br/><br/>Mackenzie is a native Texan, born-and-raised. She’s lived in College Station, Houston, Austin, and now Galveston; where she enjoys vibrant sunrises and walks on the beach with her lovable shepard-mix, Reese. Even though she only recently moved to Galveston, she is a full-on local and even placed top ten two times in the Galveston Beach Revue. Mackenzie is borderline obsessed with two things in life: museums, and her three year-old tabby cat, Owen.<br/><br/>This book is a call to action to inspire a new perspective about museums and change the way people experience them.<br/><br/>If you’d like more information, you can connect with Mackenzie via email at mtfinklea@gmail.com, on LinkedIn [<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/mackenzie-finklea-1b6ab5129/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/mackenzie-finklea-1</a>], and on Medium @mackenziefinklea or on Instagram and Twitter @mackfink.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<h3> </h3>

You will also love this book even if you hate museums or never go to them. Beyond the Halls is a non-fiction book that speaks to museum lovers and haters alike who are looking at discovering the history of museums and dynamic nature of the industry for the first time.
 
The Book - Beyond the Halls: An Insider’s Guide to Loving MuseumsThis book addresses three main topics; the history of museums, the present challenges, and future possibilities. In order to cater to several unique types of people that might read this book, the book is written in 7 parts.Part 1, the Novice, contains Chapters 1-5. Part 1 explores what museums are and introduces ways for the museum novice to interact with them.Part 2, the Historian, contains Chapters 6-10. You’ll find an introduction to various types of museums, what they are and how they came to be the respected, and the cultural phenomenon they are today.Part 3, the Curator, contains Chapters 11-14. Curators already have gone through a great deal of formal schooling to be experts in their field. Part 3 seeks to provide a fresh perspective on curatorial practices and ideals.Part 4, the Skeptic, contains Chapters 15-19. If you’re hesitant to buy into or hate museums, part 4 is for you. Part 4 takes an honest look at why museums exist and why they even matter. Museums are vibrant and exciting places for learning and, believe it or not, fun; now more than ever.Part 5, the Businessman, contains Chapters 20-22. At the end of the day, museums are a business: many of them are not for profit. They live and die in the tourism industry. Part 5 examines the current state of museums as they struggle to compete in their market.Part 6, the Activist, contains Chapters 23-26. Museums have a bit of a troubled history, but museums in the contemporary world are making changes to be more inclusive and culturally conscious. For the ones that aren’t, that’s where the activist comes in.Part 7, the Enthusiast, contains Chapters 27 and 28. Finally, the book ends with notes about my personal experience with and enthusiasm for museums. I am already on the museum-loving bandwagon, and I want you to join me.

About the Author
Mackenzie Finklea is an American Anthropologist and life-long museum enthusiast. She is a young professional who graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology, a minor in Architecture, and a certificate in Museum Studies. She was recently hired at the Bryan Museum in Galveston, Texas in the summer of 2019. In April of 2019, she was invited to speak at the TEDx conference at UT Austin about her research on Internet Memes and cyberculture. She has a long history of previous leadership roles and a vibrant fascination with displays of human culture.Mackenzie wrote this book because she believes that museums are special part of human culture. She finds the ways that people display their lives fascinating and enriching to her life. Everywhere she goes, and every time she travels, Mackenzie finds herself off the beaten path and fully immersing herself in the local culture as well as visiting as many museums as possible along the way. Mackenzie wants people to cherish and admire museums as much as she does.Mackenzie is a native Texan, born-and-raised. She’s lived in College Station, Houston, Austin, and now Galveston; where she enjoys vibrant sunrises and walks on the beach with her lovable shepard-mix, Reese. Even though she only recently moved to Galveston, she is a full-on local and even placed top ten two times in the Galveston Beach Revue. Mackenzie is borderline obsessed with two things in life: museums, and her three year-old tabby cat, Owen.This book is a call to action to inspire a new perspective about museums and change the way people experience them.If you’d like more information, you can connect with Mackenzie via email at mtfinklea@gmail.com, on LinkedIn [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mackenzie-finklea-1], and on Medium @mackenziefinklea or on Instagram and Twitter @mackfink.

Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<p>Je m'appelle Alex. Je suis une journaliste indépendante qui vis et étudie à Montréal. Je commence tout juste ma carrière de journaliste et j'ai besoin d'un premier élan pour mener à bien mes projets à l'étranger. Je m'intéresse à l'aspect international, plus spécialement aux conflits de guerre et aux injustices sociales. </p>

<p>Liban Nord – Janvier 2013</p>
<p>“J’attends que mon Papa revienne, parce qu’il n’est pas mort… J’ai entendu maman dire à ma tante qu’on l’a enterré vivant !” L’incrédulité, le déni et les cauchemars noircissent le quotidien des enfants syriens. Tout récemment reçus comme réfugiés au Liban, ils s’entassent dans des logements de fortunes et dans des camps aménagés avec les moyens du bord… Il y aurait près de 500 000 réfugiés syriens enregistrés au Liban à l’heure actuelle, selon l’ONU. Or, des sources locales rapportent une population frisant les 700 000 réfugiés. Qui plus est, la moitié de cette population serait composée d’enfants. Ainsi, quelles sont les séquelles que les jeunes réfugiés portent sur leurs épaules ?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>En me rendant dans les zones de réfugiés syriens au Liban, j’aimerais faire une série de reportages sur la condition des enfants qui s’y trouvent. J’irai directement rencontrer les enfants eux-mêmes, leurs familles, des psychologues, des ONG et des autorités locales.</p>
<p>J’estime qu’il est vital (et je ne fais pas de jeux de mots) de parler de la situation des enfants syriens. Ayant entendu des histoires bien sordides, j’aimerais rapporter des histoires vivantes et objectives de ce que vivent la jeunesse réfugiée.</p>
<p>Plus loin, j’ai l’intention de mener à bien plusieurs autres reportages au Liban. Voici les sujets que j’aimerais aborder:</p>

<p>En tant que journaliste de 22 ans, mes moyens sont très restreints. Or j’ai besoin d’un élan pour pouvoir compléter ce projet et pour pouvoir rapporter des faits touchants et importants. Je vise d’amasser assez de fonds pour couvrir les dépenses de base du voyage au Liban, voici une liste approximative :</p>
<p>Billets d’avions aller-retour vers Beyrouth : 1300$</p>

a brand new platform that seeks to revolutionize the way storytellers and story
seekers create, share and discover great stories. Our vision is to improve
human self-expression and connection through story.  We are guided by the
wonderful words of Maya Angelou, who said that “there is no greater agony than
bearing an untold story inside you.” We imagined a place where fewer and fewer
people suffer these untold stories, and the rest of the world rejoices with
them upon hearing and sharing what these storytellers have to say and now we've
now started to build that place.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1032900/files/20141120122347-Maya_Angelou_Quote5.jpg?1416515027"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 209px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/></p><p><b><a href=""http://vimeo.com/114505237"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WATCH: Why stories?</a></b></p><p><b><a href=""http://vimeo.com/114507061"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WATCH: Why should you support this campaign?</a></b></p><p><a href=""http://www.sharemorestories.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.sharemorestories.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sharemorestories.com</a> is based on the ideas that the

communal, shared storytelling; and, in doing so, also provide new opportunities

a brand new platform that seeks to revolutionize the way storytellers and story
seekers create, share and discover great stories. Our vision is to improve
human self-expression and connection through story.  We are guided by the
wonderful words of Maya Angelou, who said that “there is no greater agony than
bearing an untold story inside you.” We imagined a place where fewer and fewer
people suffer these untold stories, and the rest of the world rejoices with
them upon hearing and sharing what these storytellers have to say and now we've
now started to build that place.WATCH: Why stories?WATCH: Why should you support this campaign?sharemorestories.com is based on the ideas that the
storytelling experience is meant to be social, and that authors and readers can
collaborate together to develop great story experiences. We want to innovate
the way stories are created and shared by rekindling the ancient methods of
communal, shared storytelling; and, in doing so, also provide new opportunities
for creativity, communication and community. We call this concept Socially
Connected Story Sharing, and we believe it will enable people to find
deeper meaning in their lives and a greater sense of connection to others.WATCH: What is Socially Connected Story Sharing?Recently, our founder James Warren shared his personal story behind the journey to launch sharemorestories.com. It is a humble yet powerful testament to the notion that each of us is on a journey and has a purpose to fulfill. The experiences of those journeys are rich with stories and it is those stories that must be told.We've gotten started, but there is much to do. We hope you’ll
collaborate with us as we develop this platform. We have a bold vision and it
starts with you. Are You In?WHAT WE NEEDTo take sharemorestories.com to the next level, we need $45,000 to develop
the beta version of the platform and introduce features that make it really
easy for people to create and discover stories.We’ll do this by
building the following features:


Enhanced user
interface to improve ability to create, share and discover stories


Collaborative writing
and content crowdsourcing features


Collaborative
copyright management and protection tools and features


Features to
collaborate with a variety of writing and storytelling experts

Through the actions of the characters they will be able to follow the story line. Stories for the Grandma Jupe Children's Storybooks Project have been tested in the classroom and warmly received by both students and teachers.  Parents who purchased the original versions of <i>Scruffy Scrappy Dog</i> and <i>The Knockout Punch</i> reported favorable reactions to both of these stories.  Through the Take Me to the Farm Stand Here Stories, children will learn about such important aspects of farm life as; crops, work ethics, private property, trespassing, county fairs, types of animals, naming animals, birth and death of animals.<br/><br/>I am a very passionate and diligent writer; therefore, I have a large collection of<br/>original material that has accumulated over the years.  I am confident that the stories and music that I have selected for this project will be appealing to the public and marketable.  If funded, I am committed to seeing this project through.  Even if the project is not fully funded, I will complete as much of the project as possible.</b></span></span></span></span></span></span> <span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><b>If this campaign is successful, it will afford me the opportunity to:  1. Encourage children to read by providing stimulating material. It is commonly accepted that the reading level of many children in the United States has declined resulting in poor academic performance and school dropouts.  2. Donate books to schools and libraries and provide story telling services for children. (I have experience as a teacher, professional storyteller, and volunteer in the St. Louis Ready Readers program.)  3. Assist other authors by freely sharing my knowledge as an author and publisher. </b><br/><br/><b>Expenses for Grandma Jupe Children's Storybooks Project:</b><br/>$30,000 is needed to publish this collection of books in color and score the music.  This is an expensive undertaking.  I need a <b>crowd</b>!

At the $15 level, (Baby Duck Award) contributors who give a helping hand will receive a certificate of appreciation and a bookmark. I cannot over emphasize the importance of the impact that this group of contributors as well as those who may contribute less can make on the success of this campaign.  Any combination could very well bring about success. <br/></p>
<p>Receiving the rewards should be exciting; and I shall strive to meet that expectation.  When I send the rewards, I envision a smile on my face because I believe there will be a smile on your face reflecting pleasure and appreciation as you receive what was promised. If I exceed my goal, I will publish other writing projects in my portfolio. If I fail to reach my goal, the <b>Take Me to the Farm/Stand Here Stories</b> will be my priority. If I can't do all of the stories in that collection, I will do as many as possible. Donnell Donkey, Latonia, Sr. Galahad, Baby Duck, plus other characters from this collection must see the light of day. <br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have confidence in my creative work as well as my ability to bring the creative work to a finished product that will have good market value. The illustrations, professionally done, will be as appealing to children who can not read, as they are to readers. I am hopeful that these stories will encourage children to be more aware of the animals with whom we share the planet and will be encouraged to visit our farms and zoos. Some of my other stories about giraffes, hippos, and elephants, etc. may encourage them when they are older to learn more about animals that live in unusual habitats in faraway lands. Those stories are also waiting to be published. Our children of today will become the adults of tomorrow charged with responsibility for preserving the diversity of Earth's animal and plant life in familiar and comfortable environments for their species. </p>

Although the Earth has begun to feel much smaller due to the speed with which information and people travel, it's still a very big place and I only know a few people.  The number of contacts that can be made on behalf of my campaign can be greatly increased by the number of people you are willing to contact and they in turn are willing to contact. All contributions must be received by the deadline date, February 10, 2014. Please help in any way you can. Your involvement is important and will be sincerely appreciated.

A selection of poems/stories for children set to music waiting to be professionally scored.  Do Bee Do Bee Do; Especially for Love; This Year/If Only I Believe; No Ducks; etc. With full funding these music compositions will be professionally scored and made available to the public through a scored music sheet, disc, or something similar to what is used for musical greeting cards.The following is a portion of the ""No Ducks!"" poem/story/song.Of all the luckThere are no ducksUpon the farmer's pondThey flew awayOne autumn dayWhen nature waved her wandWith hints of snowT'was time to goTo places warmed by sunThey filled the skyWhen passing byTo watch was such great fun . . .When I am writing for children I have several things in mind.  Is the story interesting?  If it doesn't capture the child's attention, nothing else matters.  Does the story capture the child's imagination?  Will the child learn something that he or she didn't know and/or is he/she left with something significant to think about?  At the end of the story I want it to be memorable.  Will the child enjoy reading it or hearing it read again?  One of my most gratifying remarks from a parent was passed on to me by my sister, Shirley.  Her co-worker said ""Since purchasing the Scruffy Scrappy Dog book, my little boy meets me at the door each day when I get home from work, hands me the Scruffy Scrappy Dog book, and asks me to read him the story again.""  That feedback made me very happy and inspired me to continue writing.Sometimes I am questioned about vocabulary.  My storybooks are not textbooks.  I am not opposed to using words and ideas that are challenging.  If children can learn to say 'supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' along with Mary Poppins, they can handle my little vocabulary challenges.These stories illustrated by William Curtis, a talented St. Louis, Missouri artist, are designed to delight children and inspire a love of reading.  His illustrations have an appeal that transcends the story.  Little ones, not yet readers, will find the books appealing. Through the actions of the characters they will be able to follow the story line. Stories for the Grandma Jupe Children's Storybooks Project have been tested in the classroom and warmly received by both students and teachers.  Parents who purchased the original versions of Scruffy Scrappy Dog and The Knockout Punch reported favorable reactions to both of these stories.  Through the Take Me to the Farm Stand Here Stories, children will learn about such important aspects of farm life as; crops, work ethics, private property, trespassing, county fairs, types of animals, naming animals, birth and death of animals.I am a very passionate and diligent writer; therefore, I have a large collection oforiginal material that has accumulated over the years.  I am confident that the stories and music that I have selected for this project will be appealing to the public and marketable.  If funded, I am committed to seeing this project through.  Even if the project is not fully funded, I will complete as much of the project as possible. If this campaign is successful, it will afford me the opportunity to:  1. Encourage children to read by providing stimulating material. It is commonly accepted that the reading level of many children in the United States has declined resulting in poor academic performance and school dropouts.  2. Donate books to schools and libraries and provide story telling services for children. (I have experience as a teacher, professional storyteller, and volunteer in the St. Louis Ready Readers program.)  3. Assist other authors by freely sharing my knowledge as an author and publisher. Expenses for Grandma Jupe Children's Storybooks Project:$30,000 is needed to publish this collection of books in color and score the music.  This is an expensive undertaking.  I need a crowd! If funded, we are ready to complete the project and deliver the rewards by the established deadline date of April 30, 2014.The perks/rewards that I am offering are sure to delight children and please contributors. At the $15 level, (Baby Duck Award) contributors who give a helping hand will receive a certificate of appreciation and a bookmark. I cannot over emphasize the importance of the impact that this group of contributors as well as those who may contribute less can make on the success of this campaign.  Any combination could very well bring about success. 
Receiving the rewards should be exciting; and I shall strive to meet that expectation.  When I send the rewards, I envision a smile on my face because I believe there will be a smile on your face reflecting pleasure and appreciation as you receive what was promised. If I exceed my goal, I will publish other writing projects in my portfolio. If I fail to reach my goal, the Take Me to the Farm/Stand Here Stories will be my priority. If I can't do all of the stories in that collection, I will do as many as possible. Donnell Donkey, Latonia, Sr. Galahad, Baby Duck, plus other characters from this collection must see the light of day. 
The Impact
I have confidence in my creative work as well as my ability to bring the creative work to a finished product that will have good market value. The illustrations, professionally done, will be as appealing to children who can not read, as they are to readers. I am hopeful that these stories will encourage children to be more aware of the animals with whom we share the planet and will be encouraged to visit our farms and zoos. Some of my other stories about giraffes, hippos, and elephants, etc. may encourage them when they are older to learn more about animals that live in unusual habitats in faraway lands. Those stories are also waiting to be published. Our children of today will become the adults of tomorrow charged with responsibility for preserving the diversity of Earth's animal and plant life in familiar and comfortable environments for their species. 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Everyone who receives information regarding this campaign will not be able or have interest in contributing to the campaign at this time. There are other ways to help! Although the Earth has begun to feel much smaller due to the speed with which information and people travel, it's still a very big place and I only know a few people.  The number of contacts that can be made on behalf of my campaign can be greatly increased by the number of people you are willing to contact and they in turn are willing to contact. All contributions must be received by the deadline date, February 10, 2014. Please help in any way you can. Your involvement is important and will be sincerely appreciated. Thanks for visiting my campaign site.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><i>Between Demons and Deities</i> is about a mage who embarks upon a journey to the neighboring empire to save her friend, all while reckoning with newfound powers, recovering some of her lost history, and stumbling upon a sinister plot that threatens the fate of the mortal realm.<br/><br/>My name is Bianca Wang-Polendo and I am the author of <i>Between Demons and Deities</i>. I started writing this book after being sent back home from school due to the pandemic. With everything that was going on in the world, I needed to process major events and trends, so I turned toward the arts, namely writing. As a fan of fantasy, I naturally decided to use fantasy as my tool of abstract exploration, and was reminded of something I read on a writing blog: Write what you want to read. So I reflected on what exactly that meant to me: what is missing that I feel would be valuable reading? And that planted the seed to the story and some of its topics.<br/><br/>As a fantasy aficionado, I wanted to read about magic and deities and supernatural creatures. As a biracial person, I wanted to read more about multicultural identities in fantasy settings and see more characters whom I can relate to, and I also wanted to see more representation of underrepresented groups and histories. As a person who is in their early twenties, I wanted to read more about the continual process of self-reflection that extends beyond YA settings. As a citizen of the world, I wanted to read about the hope for a better world that stems from our connections to one another.<br/><br/>And so my hope is that, in reading this book, you might discover a new perspective, or perhaps see your own experiences validated. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside the characters about the importance of actively engaging in your own identity through the cycle of learning and reflecting.<br/><br/>The novel takes place in two realms: the mortal and spirit realms. Within the spirit realms, demons and ghosts roam around. In the mortal realm, we get to explore parts of Atonaco, a tropical empire surrounded by the crescent-shaped Moonstone Mountains; the Wei Empire, an expanding empire that encompasses both desert and hollow forests south of the mountain range; and the Eastern Isles, a chain of islands in the Sapphire Sea. Throughout the novel, we follow Esme, a biracial mage who specializes in fire magic and who woke up from a coma two years ago with missing memories. The other two major characters are Raiden, a mysterious and deadly former assassin in the Wei Empire, and Dacio, Esme’s closest friend and a person who specializes in spirit magic.<br/><br/><strong>Preliminary Synopsis:</strong><br/><br/>A missing past, boundless secrets, and a secret weapon that threatens the boundary between the mortal and spirit realms...<br/><br/><i>Fire mage Esmeralda has always struggled with her missing memories ever since she woke up from her coma two years ago, but Esme had her quiet life in Atonaco and her best friend and spirit mage Dacio by her side to keep her internal conflict at bay. Everything begins to crumble when Dacio is accused of a crime they couldn’t have committed, and is taken south to the Wei Empire for judgement.</i><br/><br/><i>With the help of Dacio’s mysterious friend, Esme embarks on a quest to prove Dacio’s innocence. However, things down south are not as they seem, as ominous and powerful beings lurk in the shadows, and she begins to develop magical abilities that are linked to her lost history. As she begins to piece together the mystery of her past, she stumbles upon a sinister plan that threatens the fate of the mortal realm...</i><br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy reading about magic and supernatural creatures, want to read a standalone high fantasy novel that is inspired by a mixture of East Asian and Mesoamerican cultures, and/or if you want to explore the topic of identity through a multicultural lens.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that<i> Between Demons and Deities</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>

<div>
<div>Millions benefit from Modern Postural Yoga (MPY) every day. But many are also injuring themselves, or being injured by their teachers. Just how many is hard to know, but it is happening at a higher rate than either yoga marketing or its spiritual pedigree would suggest.</div>
<div>  </div>
<div>Yoga injuries occur for many interweaving reasons. Obvious factors include prior conditioning, poor education in biomechanics, overbearing instruction, sacrificial attitudes towards pain, and group pressures to fulfill presumably shared spiritual ideals.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>More subtly, many people are first driven to asana by feelings of inadequacy or shame, and trauma. These experiences can motivate the desire for bodily reclamation and redemption, but they can also acidify practice with anxiety and impulsiveness. Asana is a crucible in which some attempt to forge new selves, and in the process, burn their bodies.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Shining light on this shadowy process can only help current and future practitioners make more mindful and sustainable choices on their path.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There is no way to prevent all injury. But I do believe that this book can model the skills of self-inquiry that will lead to more lucid understandings of practice, the flesh, experiences of pain, the studio, and the relationships of learning and teaching. My hope is that this work may help prevent the worst kind of injury: the injury one cannot digest or understand; the injury that leaves one feeling broken and embittered. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I also hope it will help those who teach become more aware of and humble before the beautiful tensions of this embodied journey, and to be clearer on where they need to learn more. </div>

If you've been following #WAWADIA so far, you'll know this book-in-progress is too big a project to describe in this window. So I made the video above. 
I've also published a 52-page prospectus to help you see the future book more clearly. 
You can open the prospectus in a new window by clicking here.
The prospectus is easy to browse, with a linked Table of Contents. You can dip in at any point. It contains:


a working thesis

a mission statement

a descriptions of the book's audiences and intentions 

the book structure so far
a rough roadmap of sections and chapters
a projected budget for the target fundraising amount
the starting lineup of my production team (research assistance, editorial, design, and more)

four draft excerpts: ""The Cremation of B.K.S. Iyengar"", ""Meeting Nancy Cochren"", ""My Left Hand: I Am That"", and ""Six Lenses for Studying Modern Postural Yoga"". (Starts on p. 16, if you're eager to get to it...)
a list of emergent themes

a ""Dramatis Personae"" (list of on-record informants)
answers to some early objections


testimonials

my bibliography so far

Here's a beautiful draft of the book's cover. Thank you to designer Laura Shaw.






  why is this book important? 

Millions benefit from Modern Postural Yoga (MPY) every day. But many are also injuring themselves, or being injured by their teachers. Just how many is hard to know, but it is happening at a higher rate than either yoga marketing or its spiritual pedigree would suggest.
  
Yoga injuries occur for many interweaving reasons. Obvious factors include prior conditioning, poor education in biomechanics, overbearing instruction, sacrificial attitudes towards pain, and group pressures to fulfill presumably shared spiritual ideals.

More subtly, many people are first driven to asana by feelings of inadequacy or shame, and trauma. These experiences can motivate the desire for bodily reclamation and redemption, but they can also acidify practice with anxiety and impulsiveness. Asana is a crucible in which some attempt to forge new selves, and in the process, burn their bodies.

Shining light on this shadowy process can only help current and future practitioners make more mindful and sustainable choices on their path.

There is no way to prevent all injury. But I do believe that this book can model the skills of self-inquiry that will lead to more lucid understandings of practice, the flesh, experiences of pain, the studio, and the relationships of learning and teaching. My hope is that this work may help prevent the worst kind of injury: the injury one cannot digest or understand; the injury that leaves one feeling broken and embittered. 

I also hope it will help those who teach become more aware of and humble before the beautiful tensions of this embodied journey, and to be clearer on where they need to learn more. 




what I'm asking for...



30K for the 20 months of work ahead.
Expenses include research assistance, investigative travel, editorial support and design. Oh, and time to write.
A detailed and transparent budget is laid out in the prospectus.
(I have a proven record of making good on these campaigns. Threads of Yoga and Family Wakes Us Up have found their readership, and acclaim. There will be bumps along the road, for sure. But I have an amazing story to follow, a lot of fire, and a ton of good help.)

under konstant forandring gennem de sidste 40 år fra at være en festival, der
hyldede H.C. Andersen inspirerede animationskortfilm til nu at være en festival
