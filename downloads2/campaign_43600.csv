All our timepieces have been created for those who pursue passion in their daily life and strive to make a difference.  Over the past seven years, CIGA Design has acquired more than 40 patents and accomplished a large array of design awards, including:CIGADesign is driven by its passion to reinvent the hollow design into a unique concept that originates refined yet affordable timepieces, to allow each wearer to live his dream.    The CIGADesign X Series integrates a patented automated mechanism embedded into a unique X-shaped skeleton – the core of the utmost sophisticated experience.The X Series displays a self-winding movement that recharges automatically as you wear it. With a power reserve of approximately 40 hours and a movement frequency of 21600 times/hour, the X Series proudly features the most compact and steady automatic movement ever created.  The dual-shell structure, equipped with a high-performance sport utility vehicle suspension system, includes a four-angle spring distribution to unveil the all-new CIGADesign anti-vibration capability.This feature minimizes the impact of external forces on the watch movement, with stunning shock absorption that protects the mechanism and optimizes the X Series flawless functioning.  Crafted in Titanium Grade 2, with excellent biocompatibility, the X Series Titanium is designed specifically for sport and the outdoors, boasting excellent durability even for the most extreme action.  The Titanium & Gold(DLC Coating) has both DLC and Gold coating. The Diamond-like Carbon makes this version an unmistakable finish with supreme resistance to daily wear. Plus the 18k gold coating adding a luxury element to this distinctive timepiece.  A single glance is enough to recognize that the CIGADesign X series is not just a transparent timekeeper. Every detail, component, and the mechanical part of CIGADesign was designed with absolute purity in mind.  Everything you see, Super-LumiNova® will make it brighter.A powerful look and even more stunning at nighttime, X Series Super-LumiNova is where your senses come awake. *Note 1: In order to enhance the natural brightness of pure silver, CIGA Design does not offer Super-LumiNova feature on the watches from its Silver collection.*Note 2: Black & Purple version's luminosity brightness is 50% as  Black & Orange version's.  We have designed a completely timeless creation. Everything – each line and corner – helped us to forge perfection.  The X Series is a timepiece that combines tradition with cutting-edge ideas. We plated the crown interior in a vivid red color to mark the contrast with the stainless steel of the outer case.This reminds us of our mission to create the world's most unique mechanical miracle.  The inner mechanism is showcased by the transparency of the sapphire front glass, which features 1800 Vickers (9 Mohs) hardness, making the X Series highly resistant to scratches.  Every luxury wristwatch is a unique piece that cannot be repeated.With this idea in mind, X Series has been beautifully handcrafted to be much more than a magnificent timekeeper. It is a CIGA Design watchmaking heritage.  Less costly than leather, more durable than nylon and, unlike metal, scratch-resistant, the versatile silicone strap wristwatch keeps you ready for any adventure!    The X Series has already reached many corners of the world, where our backers have appreciated its value and cherished its style.  CIGADesign Product Box – A package, a gift, an artwork. A wonderful journey.A good design is like a good book – You read it, you feel it, you live it. Furthermore, a design timepiece will bring you to the beginning of a new, unforgettable journey.    CIGA Design is committed to creating simple and innovative designs that define wristwatches as an artistic item.

Plus a special discount and sock bundle if you buy for the whole 5 a side team!If we don’t reach our goal, you will be refunded the amount you paid and we will find another way to bring Ida to the court.THE IMPACTJust like with our outdoor firm ground boot, this futsal shoe ensures that more female athletes have a better experience playing the game that they love.We were blown away by the response to our outdoor boot, and we can’t wait to see the difference this shoe makes to futsal players across the globe.Whether you are backing this for performance or just want one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes you’ve ever worn, we are sure you won’t be disappointed. So are men's and women's feet really that different? Short answer... yes!The differences are small but have a huge impact on comfort, fit, and injury prevention. Women’s feet tend to be smaller, have a different length to width ratio in the toes, and are narrower at the heel. We have done extensive research with athletes, physiotherapists, and podiatrists to construct our cleats, and now a futsal boot, that accommodate the higher arch, wider hips, and unique pressure loads that women have compared to men. PROVEN SUCCESSWe’ve seen an amazing response to our outdoor boots, and now we want to bring this impact to the futsal courts and indoor turf! IN THE NEWS'We've done something crazy': the football boots designed for women'‘As a child I dreamt of boots designed just for women – now I have them’No more ‘pink it and shrink it’ as women get boots made for women’s feet at lastWomen's sports combatting a surprising barrier to entry: gear designed with men in mindWithout Compromise Podcast with Laura Youngson OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPWe know that this product isn’t for everyone!

   SIZING AND OTHER FAQSIf you've been following us from day one, you'll be excited to see our expanded range of sizes available for the Futsal shoe! Check out the guide below to get an idea of your size need, and then scroll up to the FAQ section for the answers to all your company, shipping, and logistics questions.* NOTE: we also have size 43 available (not shown when selecting in the perks section). Click on size 35 and send us a message for size 43! We'll handle it behind the scenes. PRODUCTION & DELIVERY TIMELINEWe plan on shipping the shoes within 14 days of the campaign ending. RETURNS & EXCHANGESWe are more than happy to organise free returns and size exchange if the boots aren’t quite a good fit. RISKS & CHALLENGESHaving (successfully) launched our first boot in the middle of a global pandemic, we’ve seen that things don’t always go to plan!With the leaps we’ve made in our supply chain this past year though, we’re pretty confident you’ll be able to receive your boots within a month of the campaign ending.However, Covid-19 has impacted many manufacturers around the world and so sometimes there are delays we cannot control. We would ask that in the event of this you remain patient. STILL HAVE A QUESTION? Check out the full list of FAQS at the top of the page. Still have a question after that? Email us at hello@idasports.co. Thanks for reading a bit more about our campaign and we look forward to going on to bigger and better things in 2021 and beyond! www.idasports.com VIDEO CREDITSFor Equal Playing Field: Dana Roesiger, Matthew Pendergast, Kevin BlankenshipFor Monash University: Kero Sun",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>Republic Services Boots</strong><b>© - </b><strong>Hybrid Workman Utility 1080©</strong>.</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Ray, Founder and Creative Director Of the <strong>Republic Services Boots</strong><b>© </b>brand, and I will like to share with you a wonderful opportunity into giving back to yourself and your community by supporting a brand built by the people, for the people.</p>
<p>I'm a designer located in the wonderful city of Las Vegas, NV and I've owned multiple retail businesses over the past 6 years here. In 2019 pre<strong> Covid-19</strong> I was finishing up my second retail location for our clothing brand Milk Money Limited. After a successful 6 months of opening <strong>Covid</strong>-<strong>19</strong> hit us hard causing us to close our shop in definitely. With our backs against the wall, I went to work rebranding our business and focusing on E-commerce and creating a more presence online building our community for the months to come. </p>
<p>After Months of designing and sketching and working on our brands, I started to have multiple conversations with friends and supporters who kept asking about a pair of boots that I had posted on our social media platform. From that feedback I went and started to focus on <strong>Republic Services Boots</strong><b>©. </b>After so many conversations I realized the community wanted to HELP us but needed a product that could not only serve as support but could benefit the community equally!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625608831/v1vnxzpyrxul2b24prab.jpg"" src=""""/>We’ve come to understand that our communities across the globe face new and complex challenges, and we believe it’s all of our responsibility to do more. <strong>Republic Services Boots©</strong> is the answer to our communities voices that have asked for quality, utility, and durability as well as stylish multi-purpose boots. Our Footwear journey begins with our durable <strong>Hybrid Workman Utility 1080©</strong>.</p>
<p>This boot has taken us over 10 months developing with multiple terrain tests and multi weather tests, leading us to put together quality materials to make up our <strong>Hybrid Workman Utility 1080</strong><b>©. </b></p>
<p>However our boots are not just another pair of boots, we are not just another shoe manufacturer, <strong>Republic Services</strong><b>©</b> stands with brands like <strong>TOMS</strong><b>© </b>as a One for One company! Our mission is to be in the business of changing lives, as a community we intend to give a pair of shoes for every pair of boots we sell! <strong>Republic Services</strong><b>©</b> at it's inception is a for-profit business with ""Giving"" at its core! </p>
<p>Our overall goal is to invest in a team of domestic and international development, health, and nonprofit professionals, over the next 10 years, to help develop relationships with over 200 non-governmental and humanitarian organizations in about 80 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>Working hand-in-hand with these organizations, <strong>Republic Services</strong><b>© </b>could better understand the needs of the communities being served. We could also help meet these needs by integrating <strong>Republic Services</strong><b>© </b>resources into existing programs, like those supporting health, education, and economic community development within our community.

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Republic Services Boots</strong><b>© </b>is looking to raise<strong> 70k</strong> in <strong>60 days!</strong> Our goal of <strong>250 </strong>Pairs sold in <strong>30 days</strong> at a retail price of <strong>$280.00 usd</strong>  is a formidable challenge that we've taken head on! And with help from our community we believe anything is possible if we do it together!</p>
<p>This initial funding round will allow us to set up our distribution warehouse and begin the hiring process for our business, it also will allow us to have an opportunity to set up potential distribution relationships with other businesses who can purchase our boots wholesale from us! Our goal is to build trust and long term business relationships with well known distribution outlets as well as factory and government outlets!</p>
<p>Unlike other shoe brands we deliver the BIGGEST perk of all...the gift of giving! With the one for one model you have a opportunity to not only own a new brand of stylish innovative hybrid boots, but you get to do so at the expense of another human being less fortunate having the ability to have a pair of shoes that he or she probably wouldn't have without your support! WIN WIN!</p>
<p>Unfortunately we are absolutely realistic, goals, especially BIG goals face challenges, and ours is a mountain! Being a independent black owned footwear company comes with multiple challenges and not every goal is met, we intend to put all the funds raised back into the business with NO salaries being taken within the first year until we reach our goals and become profitable! That is our pledge to our community as we look for you to help support this brand!</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Our Impact is based on the communities willingness to come together! And we love that statement! In the day and age of popularity, brands that aren't apart of the social norm can go neglected, not only does this happen so often, but the community apart helps the RICH stay RICH by willingly taking money from the community and into the pockets of those who don't re invest resources and money back into them! <strong>Republic Services Boots</strong><b>© </b>is the complete opposite! We are one of the first creative and futuristic brands of its kind, built with the sole intentions on reinvesting money jobs and resources back into the community! This alone will be impactful, this concept is going to be an example for our children and their children on how to break the strong hold on us mentally from the BIG POWER brands, and take our money and reinvest it back into ourselves! This is Extremely Valuable for us all.</p>
<p>Like our other brand, Milk Money Limited, we set out to inspire our community and bring all creatives together, and after 6 long years of creating, designing, and building up our community, we are proud to say that we have been responsible in assisting and helping well over 30 brands get started and producing products! Many of whom have become well known, and now hundreds of more being developed everyday! With a healthy track record of building a brand with its community we intend to make <strong>Republic Services Boots</strong><b>© </b>EVEN BIGGER!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone who has great ideas and ambitions will face risks and challenges, ours started with manufacturing a quality boot, that could pass significant health and factory codes as well as government codes all while being cool and stylish and futuristic! Challenge taken, challenge defeated! Our next challenge will be promoting and marketing our Fund Raise and so we would ask even if you can't purchase a pair today please share this link with a friend or a stranger! And post it on your social media accounts, help us raise awareness because we will really appreciate ANYTHING you can do!</p>

<p>Let me introduce the F16 fighting falcon inspired watch, that honor the plane and all the people that keep the plane safe, on its wings day and night.</p>
<p>The watch case is made in brushed Titanium grade 5 alloy, same material that's used in the aviation industry.</p>
<p>My name is Thomas and I'm a former aircraft mechanic in the Danish Airforce and the civil aviation industry. </p>
<p>Together with a freelance designer, that also love watches and airplanes, and another product developer, we been working on this watch the last nine months because we love watches and airplanes, and we really want to make a special watch for watch lovers and all the people involved around the F16, whether you are a pilot, aircraft mechanic, fuel service staff, ammunition team, office administration - all the people that would want a piece of memory for their time in service working with the F16.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545169067/srvqtczzcyyuqcgflyp6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have developed the watch and designed 2D sketches, 3D parts, 3D print models and 3D video and are now ready to order the prototype that we are going to use for the main crowdfunding campaign of 300 pcs.</p>
<p>We have a manufacturer partner to produce the prototype and we need your help to fund the prototype.</p>
<p>In return of your help, we gonna offer a huge discount on the first 40 watches, 75% discount of expected retail price $1133 - so you can get this amazing watch for only $283 if you are really fast.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545169229/wfgi4fmqon5y603sgx5o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We dont ask much for putting the prototype into production, we need to reach $6000 in fundings, that will cover the prototype moulds and manufacture of one piece watch.</span></p>
<p>For that amount we offer 40 F16 watches with a huge discount of 86% if you help to get this watch into production.</p>

</div></div>","Let me introduce the F16 fighting falcon inspired watch, that honor the plane and all the people that keep the plane safe, on its wings day and night.
The watch case is made in brushed Titanium grade 5 alloy, same material that's used in the aviation industry.
My name is Thomas and I'm a former aircraft mechanic in the Danish Airforce and the civil aviation industry. 
Together with a freelance designer, that also love watches and airplanes, and another product developer, we been working on this watch the last nine months because we love watches and airplanes, and we really want to make a special watch for watch lovers and all the people involved around the F16, whether you are a pilot, aircraft mechanic, fuel service staff, ammunition team, office administration - all the people that would want a piece of memory for their time in service working with the F16.

We have developed the watch and designed 2D sketches, 3D parts, 3D print models and 3D video and are now ready to order the prototype that we are going to use for the main crowdfunding campaign of 300 pcs.
We have a manufacturer partner to produce the prototype and we need your help to fund the prototype.
In return of your help, we gonna offer a huge discount on the first 40 watches, 75% discount of expected retail price $1133 - so you can get this amazing watch for only $283 if you are really fast.

We dont ask much for putting the prototype into production, we need to reach $6000 in fundings, that will cover the prototype moulds and manufacture of one piece watch.
For that amount we offer 40 F16 watches with a huge discount of 86% if you help to get this watch into production.


When we have the prototype we gonna make pro photo shoot, video and marketing and launch the main campaign with 50% discount of expected retail price.
The first 40 that help with the protype will get a big discount on watch and a special designed T-shirt from Pitotwatches with a special thank you for make this project come true.
We have had amazing feedback on this watch on both instagram and other social media and people love the design and are ready to buy from the 2D sketches alone since such a different and unique watch in airplane materials - if the campaign is not fully funded, we will return your money - but we believe in this, along with many other fans and we know we have developed a very unique watch that come in airplane quality.

<p>Hi, my name is Levi Mukuna, I am the CEO and Founder of LVNGTN Watches Inc. My background is Congolese from the Democratic Republic of Congo, born in France and raised in Canada. My love for watches started with my father, as a young boy I admired his watch collection and my first watch was given to me by him. I’ve always had an appreciation for watches as they are a reminder of my father and the many sacrifices he made for our family to have opportunities to succeed in life. We want LVNGTN Watches to be a symbol of the many opportunities that young people are capable of achieving.</p>

<p>Nowadays, 90% of the sunglasses industry is monopolised by 3 main multinational companies. Therefore they have complete control of pricing and take advantage of the situation, making sunglasses a luxury product.</p></figure></div><p>However, things are starting to change. Thanks to brands like AVALON, that are offering identical quality products at a groundbreaking accessible price point. In AVALON we produce, distribute and sell on our own. This allows us to reduce the costs that come with working with intermediaries and more importantly, it allows us to do things our own way.</p><p> </p><div>

</div></div>","We have developed a high-quality product range with an amazing design and produced it with the best low-polluting materials. We are very proud to say that AVALON are the best sunglasses you will ever find at an accessible price point. Where style and function meet sustainability. 
 
Nowadays, 90% of the sunglasses industry is monopolised by 3 main multinational companies. Therefore they have complete control of pricing and take advantage of the situation, making sunglasses a luxury product.However, things are starting to change. Thanks to brands like AVALON, that are offering identical quality products at a groundbreaking accessible price point. In AVALON we produce, distribute and sell on our own. This allows us to reduce the costs that come with working with intermediaries and more importantly, it allows us to do things our own way. 
 
  
We have developed a collection of 3 unisex styles: Kendall, Denver and Arizona.
All of them are produced in the best high-quality recycled materials. Each one of them comes in 4 different colorways and we have to warn you: Choosing only one is not an easy task! (Scroll down if you can't wait to see the full collection)


 
 


 
 


 
 

As we said, AVALON sunglasses are made from eco-friendly materials. 
Our frames are made from Italian high resistance recycled polycarbonate, an ultra-lightweight material that is extremely tough and flexible at the same time, and offers resistance to impact and high temperatures. 
Our lenses, on the other hand, are produced in German TAC, also known as Cellulose Triacetate. They are polarised, category 3 UV400, and will protect you against 100% of the sun's UV rays. Using the best filters in the market was a crucial matter to us, as we want to make sure that your eyes are completely protected while you are enjoying your favourite activities.
 

 

  


We have spent many hours working in each one of our designs, making sure there is something for every face shape and every fashion preference.
We were inspired by iconic styles, but also by trendy and groundbreaking contemporary designs. The final result is a balanced, clean, timeless and comfortable collection.
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 


 

 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
Avalon sunglasses are produced with recycled material, which makes them very respectful with the environment, moreover, our factories are audited, and have ISO9000, ISO14000 and SEDEX certifications. Which gives them the quality certificates in health and safety for their workers, freedom of association, right to collective bargaining, remuneration and working hours according to the laws. 
 

 

 
Our goal is to find a balance between fashion and sustainability. 
More than 1000 kg of plastic ends up in the ocean every five seconds. As a result, 40% of the earth’s ocean areas have already been taken over by plastic. Even if we are still not able to truly know what the long term consequences will be, we must take responsibility and start changing this disastrous situation.

For this campaign, we will be focusing all of our efforts into recycling one plastic water bottle for each one of our backers.
Guess how? We will use rPET, a material made out of used plastic bottles for our packaging!
 

 

 

 

 
We have said many times already that we want to keep improving our  product into a more sustainable one, and your amazing support has  allowed us to do so. We are super proud to share with you that we will officially be making all of the cloth pouches and cleaning cloths out of 100% recycled plastics! And that worldwide brands such as Patagonia and  Timberland, have been using for years. But what does that mean? 

Recycled polyester gives a second life to a material that’s not  biodegradable and would otherwise end up in landfill or the ocean
Performance and durability, including high strength and functional versatility of recycled polyester is the same than traditional  polyester, but with a lower environmental impact.
Producing rPET requires 59% less energy compared to virgin polyester.
It doesn’t require new petroleum to create, lowering the demand  for new petroleum extraction and reducing our overall carbon footprint  as it creates 75% less CO2 emissions than virgin polyester.

This means that for each pair of sunglasses we produce, we will be  recycling 1 plastic bottle, and therefore avoiding that they end up in  landfills or the ocean.
 Take a look on rPET's manufacturing process here: 

 
 

 
 

All of our backers will receive their AVALON sunglasses together with a beautiful re-usable box, a microfiber pouch to take on the go, and a matching cloth to keep your sunglasses looking fresh.

<p>Blue-Block Lenses: Not all colors of light have the same effect. Blue wavelengths, which are good during daylight, because they boost attention, reaction times, and mood happens to be the most disruptive at night time. And the proliferation of electronics with screens, is increasing our exposure to blue wavelengths, especially after sundown.

</div></div>","OVERVIEWFlexsee Glasses are made of robust materials and bring smart solutions to conventional problems. Chic design and practicality in usage are the basics of our genetic code.  Smart Case
Usage of our magical magnetic power technology is not limited to our frames. We use it in our cases too, so their function is not only to protect your frame but also to ease your life. 

 
Flexsee Magnetic launch collection comes with two different shapes, plus six different color & texture options. Smart cases also have six different color options. 
The smart cases enable you to use your phone’s camera and your navigation holder without detaching the case from your phone. 
 
                                
Durable
When durability tests guaranteed us ten years of everyday use, we were dismayed. But we keep faith that your dog will chewup a few pairs, and that will keep us in the market.
                               
Magnetic Hinge Design
With no-screw temples our magic power snaps the frame into a very thin shape. Storing the frame in the case will help to retain the folded shape.

Adjustable Temple Tips
Our “Adjustable Temple Tip” is a must for a “One size fits all” frame. If Flexsee magnetic does not fit your face, you are a truly unique person, which is not such a bad thing after all.

UV 400 Protection 
All Flexsee lenses protect you from UV400 by blocking the UV lights. The UV protection is built into the lenses,so it won't fade or disappear over time.

 

 
Frame Design & Colors
We have two shapes for our launch collection available in red, black, navy-blue, green solid colors and also brown tortoise, black marble texture options. Don’t  worry one will definitely look great on you.

 
We use top quality lenses with UV400 protection, anti-reflective, scratch resistant  and blue-block options to fulfill your needs. 
Monofocal Lenses: These are the most common lenses to maximize your angle of vision. If your presbyopia has different powers, no worries, you can always buy two pairs and easily change the lenses by yourself and chip in to our retirement yacht.

None of them worked and many were very uncomfortable or irritating, especially the eye masks or the ones that used light and sound.Lucid dreaming is a skill we really wanted to master, so we decided to make our own lucid dreaming conditioning device. We want to make lucid dreaming possible for everyone, which resulted in the discrete InstaDreamer wristband. It is comfortable to wear, and it will help propel you towards controlling your dreams. Below, you can see the very first working prototype that we started producing in September 2017 with the VibraSmart™ Technology alarm in action. On the final product, vibration strength is set by user.
We can’t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make InstaDreamer a reality.We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can’t give a dollar or purchase an InstaDreamer, if you’re a supporter of InstaDreamer, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!",33.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>When we launched the first Pollix product in 2016, we could hardly believe the positive reception across Europe, hitting our 10,000-unit sales goal well ahead of schedule. Eager to continue to grow, we listened to our customers, improving our products based on their feedback. We are ready to turn Pollix into a world-class brand, one that stands for quality and change above all else.</p>
<p>We have chosen to launch a Kickstarter campaign so that we can involve our customers in our continued growth and development. As we move toward a more expansive platform that integrates AI into fitness, we are paying close attention to what all our users think about our ideas and our products. We believe that your input is critical to our success, which is why we invite you to continue to challenge us relentlessly. Together, we can build Pollix into something special.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>As we continue to collaborate with our partners and third-party vendors, we understand that the risk of delay is real. Because we have chosen to use lithium batteries for our products, shipping poses a unique difficulty, and prices and timing may differ from one place to another, especially in certain countries. As confident as we are in our supply chain – which is years in the making – we are realistic about the challenges we are facing. We promise to keep all our contributors up to date regarding all the progress that we make.</p>

Swimproof & Tracks Swims up to 50M - Get in the pool and start working out! Whether you are swimming or jogging in the rain, you can count on Pollix Watch to remain functional, counting your stats and keeping track of your progress.  
24/7 Heart Rate & Heart Rate Zones - You can always stay informed regarding your heart rate when you are using Pollix Watch. Our 24/7 heart rate will determine your calorie burn, workout, and health trend goals, and our real-time dynamic heart rate zone will tell you when you are in a fat burn, aerobic, or extreme zone so that you can modify your workouts appropriately.
 


 
Keep a close eye on your ECG – right from your own wrist. Pollix Watch will notify you if your heart rate dips or spikes, and it will also pick up on irregular rhythms. From fall detection to emergency SOS alerts, our smartwatch keeps you safe and healthy.
 

This Watch goes beyond workouts: Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR) and Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) are just a peek away using our always-on ECG. This Watch recognizes more than ten different arrhythmia symptoms, including tachycardia, bradycardia, and tachyarrhythmia.
 

Keeping you alive, your blood deserves your respect. You can watch your blood pressure closely, reading your numbers accurately through a high sampling frequency made possible by Pollix Watch.
 

Those who do it swear it by it, and it can change your life. Breathing naturally and with awareness for one minute, you can enter a meditative state, and Pollix will be there right beside you, keeping tracking of your HRV values to put a score on your meditation.
 

Without sleep, nothing else matters. Pollix Watch will determine your sleep quality, recording your deep sleep, light sleep, and waking times to figure out how much rest you need.
 

Don't catch yourself running on empty! Pollix Watch will tell you when you are fatigued and need to sit down or sleep for a while. 
 
Unavoidable Alerts - However you want to receive your alerts, you can – through call, text, calendar notifications, or push notifications.
 
 Motivation to Succeed - Nothing will set you up for success like a little healthy competition. Share your activities with your friends, organize coaching, set up challenges, and earn awards. Our smartwatch lets you know – it's time to be your best!
   
Track your full activity - with Pollix Widgets you can check your steps, distance, standing, energy, workout, heart rate, sleep stats, and more
 
 


 
Your Pollix Watch will fit any normal-size 20mm band, including sports brand designed for movement and breathability, stylish woven bands, and premium leather bands. You can change the bracelet or watch face on Pollix to match your style at will.
 

Clock Faces - Tell the time the old-fashioned way. You can select any clock face that suits you.
 

 
 

 

 
We have designed Pollix Watch to help you achieve excellence, integrating a GPS, optical heart sensor, electrical heart sensor, and more into an aluminum grade case with a Gorilla Glass Screen and a long battery life.
 

 



 
Our fitness activity tracker will keep you updated on anything and everything you need to know regarding your physical progress. This includes 24/7 heart rate monitoring, an ECG, result-oriented workouts, swim-proof and waterproof protection, sleep tracking and quality improvement, push notifications, a long-lasting battery, and a full touch color IPS display.
 

 

 

 

 
Always know your weight – with Pollix Scale. Using Pollix Scale, your weight, body fat percentage, BMI, and lean mass readings are only a tap away.
 
 
 

 

 
 

 
Partnering with capable, world-class designers and engineers, we have developed Pollix Watch to stand apart in the modern world. We have let no detail fall by the wayside, optimizing style and function at every step. Nothing but perfect is acceptable for Pollix Watch.

Technology process
 

Prototyping process
 
 

Over the course of this year, we have put Pollix Watch through twenty prototypes

 
 

Our team includes AI experts, software engineers, hardware engineers, mechanical engineers, product developers, designers, project managers, investors, and marketers. We bring to the table a full stack of skills, and we are all eager to introduce the world to our AI-driven fitness plans. Talented and enthusiastic, we will stop at nothing to put our plans into practice. WHY KICKSTARTER?

 
When we launched the first Pollix product in 2016, we could hardly believe the positive reception across Europe, hitting our 10,000-unit sales goal well ahead of schedule. Eager to continue to grow, we listened to our customers, improving our products based on their feedback. We are ready to turn Pollix into a world-class brand, one that stands for quality and change above all else.
We have chosen to launch a Kickstarter campaign so that we can involve our customers in our continued growth and development. As we move toward a more expansive platform that integrates AI into fitness, we are paying close attention to what all our users think about our ideas and our products. We believe that your input is critical to our success, which is why we invite you to continue to challenge us relentlessly. Together, we can build Pollix into something special.

Risks and challenges
As we continue to collaborate with our partners and third-party vendors, we understand that the risk of delay is real. Because we have chosen to use lithium batteries for our products, shipping poses a unique difficulty, and prices and timing may differ from one place to another, especially in certain countries. As confident as we are in our supply chain – which is years in the making – we are realistic about the challenges we are facing. We promise to keep all our contributors up to date regarding all the progress that we make.

<h2>Short Summary</h2> <p>The co-founders of Seven Culture are Duane Wainman and Corbin Bean. We both live in Toronto and have been friends for the better part of our lives. We decided to found a company together because we were both on the quest to find our prupose and more fufillment in our lives.</p> <p>Hello, my name is Duane Wainman and I am 28 years old, born in North Bay, Ontario, Canada. I played Junior A hockey after graduating high school and received a hockey scholarship to attend Lindenwood University, where I studied Psychology. After 4 years at Lindenwood, I ended up as the all-time leading scorer in program history, and with a bachelor of arts degree in Psychology. While I was not playing hockey I was working for Spy Communications, a telecommunications company in Ontario. I worked my way up from a laborer to a Human Resource Manager, which sparked my interest in the HR field. This interest allowed me to be accepted into the Masters of Human Resource Management program at Lindenwood the following semester. I graduated with a master's degree in one year with a 4.0 GPA. I went back to Spy Communications where I received another promotion to a Regional Manager in Toronto, Ontario. Although I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Spy, I began to want more in life, I enjoyed developing strategic avenues, recruiting top-tier talent, and creating a thriving environment. I also wanted to create my own business that would help give, not only myself but other people more of a purpose. </p> <p>My name is Corbin Bean, I’m a 28 year old from London, ON, Canada. Growing up hockey was always my passion, which helped lead me to Nipissing University where I went for 3 years taking Sociology. I currently work in the finance field for GoToLoans as a territory manager. I’ve always had a dream of being a business owner. After speaking with Duane for endless hours, we decided we needed to expand and make a difference in the world, and that’s where we discovered Seven Culture.   </p> <p>A company selling products is cool, but we still did not think it would give us enough purpose. So we both brainstormed what needs action now, that will benefit the whole world in the future. That's where it was obvious, we were going to donate a portion of our proceeds to help establish the Coral Reef. It has been revealed by scientists that 50% of the coral reefs on the planet have already been destroyed, and the remaining 50% could be in jeopardy if we don’t act now. The repercussions of losing the Coral Reef in the ecosystem. If we lose all the Coral Reefs our ecosystem will be in a major “domino effect” scenario where fish may become extinct. Without fish, all fishermen will lose their jobs and force major developed countries to find a new source of food. This will create an economic disaster affecting millions and millions of people.</p> <p>This campaign is clearly important to us because we have a true passion in front of us. We want to both only work for Seven and grow this company so that we can help give a purpose and fulfillment to so many other people on the planet. We want to create a worldwide culture and create moments with people around the world that we/they will never forget. We want our products to help create awareness so that our dream can become a reality, and help bring the world together for one cause.</p> <h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2> <p>We are looking for at least $20,000 from early backers to help us fund our customized watch collection, improve our clothing line by finding more ways to reduce our negative effects on the ocean, develop and implement new marketing strategies, and train our employees to continue to grow and thrive.</p> <p>Our financial breakdown looks like this:</p> <h3>$5,000 for marketing.</h3>
<ul>
<li>$5/ a day for Facebook/Instagram Ads = $1,825/annually.</li>
<li>$5/ a day for Snapchat/TikTok Ads =$1,825/annually.</li>
<li>$1,350 to influencers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>$5,000 for product development.</h3>
<ul>
<li>$2,000 to improve watch components/packaging.</li>
<li>$2,000 to research new designs.</li>
<li>$1,000 to improve/design new clothing lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>$5,000 for research, training and company development.</h3>
<ul>
<li>$1,000 to research how to grow our company.</li>
<li>$3,000 to train employees.</li>
<li>$1,000 to improve company policies, procedures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>$3,200 for intangibles.</h3>
<ul><li>$3,200 for security and new issues that arise.</li></ul> <p>Our perk options are an exclusive deal from our luxury clothing line, a three-pack of our top three items, Classic Hoodie, Round Neck T, and our Classic T (Premium). These products are all produced in France, and are ethically sourced, ZERO plastic packagaing, 100% organic cotton products.</p> <p>If we do not reach the $20,000 goal, we will take what we have and make the most of it with our company. The backers that have trusted us will still receive their perks of choice. We will discuss as a team and prioritize what department to invest in and how much. </p> <h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Seven Culture is not only selling customers material products, we are selling customers emotions, and motivations that come with our products.</p> <p>With our customized watch collection we want our customers to feel more empowered to use their time more wisely. We want our customers to remember to stop and enjoy moments with friends and family. Ultimately, our time is the most valuable thing we have on this planet, so let's make a difference with it. Buying a Seven Watch means more than just receiving a watch. You have donated to the Coral Reef. You have made a difference. You have made an impact. So, in conclusion, our customers who buy a watch will leave with a new, luxury watch, the feeling of joining a team of diversity and inclusion, a new purpose by donating to the Coral Reef, and ultimately this combination will equal the feeling of fulfillment. </p> <p>Our clothing line will not only give customers a new sleek, and stylish attires, but it will raise awareness and also add more emotions to our customers. For us when we have felt the best in a social environment is when we are having a “heart-to-heart” with an old friend, new friend, stranger, sibling, parent, cousin, whoever, and we feel safe, secure, and warm. We feel like we can say whatever we want, we feel like we are meant to be where we are in life. This feeling we want our clothing line to bring to people all over the world. By buying a piece of Seven clothing, we want our customers to feel secure, safe, warm, and included in the bigger picture. We want our customers to know that they are now involved in our “heart-to-heart” with the world. </p> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The rise to success will not be a straight shot. There will be numerous challenges we will need to overcome. The first challenge in selling products to an audience is marketing. Our marketing needs to be top tier in order for us to stand out from the rest. The best way to do this is to learn as much as we can from our audience and where they spend most of their time. Our target audience is 13-40-year-olds, which consists of three different generations. The place all three of these generations spend most of their time is on social media. That will be our plan of attack. We will need to create social media ads that are engaging and spark interest. We know from research that millennials and Gen-Z are most interested in making a positive impact on the planet and that's why we will be promoting how we are dedicated to reestablishing the Coral Reef.</p> <p>The next problem we will encounter will be shipping our products worldwide. To tackle this issue we will be upfront and honest with our customers. If a delay is expected we will communicate via email and text message. We want our customers to trust us and I know that we are committed to them. Furthermore, we have communicated with our distributors and suppliers and reminded them of the importance of delivering on time. This is one of our biggest pillars to success.</p> <h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Even if you are unable to contribute financially there are multiple other ways you can help. Firstly, you can just simply talk about us and our passion. You can discuss how we are bringing the world together for one cause. You can talk about how our vision with our watch collection can benefit the world, you can talk about how our clothing line gives you “goosebumps” because reading about it made you remember some of the most memorable times. Secondly, you can follow us on social media and keep up to date with our progress. Thirdly, you can promote our beliefs, passion, and products. Share our posts on social media, share your friends wearing our products, comment on our posts, interact with us, engage with us in any way that will be beneficial. We would love to hear from each and every one of you. Lastly, you can help by also donating to the Coral Reef and helping us fix a huge part of our ecosystem, we won't be jealous, we promise. Any amount can truly make a big impact. Do not forget Indiegogo has sharing tools as well that can help us get our name out there and make a big splash!!!!</p>

These products are all produced in France, and are ethically sourced, ZERO plastic packagaing, 100% organic cotton products. If we do not reach the $20,000 goal, we will take what we have and make the most of it with our company. The backers that have trusted us will still receive their perks of choice. We will discuss as a team and prioritize what department to invest in and how much.  The Impact
Seven Culture is not only selling customers material products, we are selling customers emotions, and motivations that come with our products. With our customized watch collection we want our customers to feel more empowered to use their time more wisely. We want our customers to remember to stop and enjoy moments with friends and family. Ultimately, our time is the most valuable thing we have on this planet, so let's make a difference with it. Buying a Seven Watch means more than just receiving a watch. You have donated to the Coral Reef. You have made a difference. You have made an impact. So, in conclusion, our customers who buy a watch will leave with a new, luxury watch, the feeling of joining a team of diversity and inclusion, a new purpose by donating to the Coral Reef, and ultimately this combination will equal the feeling of fulfillment.  Our clothing line will not only give customers a new sleek, and stylish attires, but it will raise awareness and also add more emotions to our customers. For us when we have felt the best in a social environment is when we are having a “heart-to-heart” with an old friend, new friend, stranger, sibling, parent, cousin, whoever, and we feel safe, secure, and warm. We feel like we can say whatever we want, we feel like we are meant to be where we are in life. This feeling we want our clothing line to bring to people all over the world. By buying a piece of Seven clothing, we want our customers to feel secure, safe, warm, and included in the bigger picture. We want our customers to know that they are now involved in our “heart-to-heart” with the world.  Risks & Challenges
The rise to success will not be a straight shot. There will be numerous challenges we will need to overcome. The first challenge in selling products to an audience is marketing. Our marketing needs to be top tier in order for us to stand out from the rest. The best way to do this is to learn as much as we can from our audience and where they spend most of their time. Our target audience is 13-40-year-olds, which consists of three different generations. The place all three of these generations spend most of their time is on social media. That will be our plan of attack. We will need to create social media ads that are engaging and spark interest. We know from research that millennials and Gen-Z are most interested in making a positive impact on the planet and that's why we will be promoting how we are dedicated to reestablishing the Coral Reef. The next problem we will encounter will be shipping our products worldwide. To tackle this issue we will be upfront and honest with our customers. If a delay is expected we will communicate via email and text message. We want our customers to trust us and I know that we are committed to them. Furthermore, we have communicated with our distributors and suppliers and reminded them of the importance of delivering on time. This is one of our biggest pillars to success. Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you are unable to contribute financially there are multiple other ways you can help. Firstly, you can just simply talk about us and our passion. You can discuss how we are bringing the world together for one cause. You can talk about how our vision with our watch collection can benefit the world, you can talk about how our clothing line gives you “goosebumps” because reading about it made you remember some of the most memorable times. Secondly, you can follow us on social media and keep up to date with our progress. Thirdly, you can promote our beliefs, passion, and products. Share our posts on social media, share your friends wearing our products, comment on our posts, interact with us, engage with us in any way that will be beneficial. We would love to hear from each and every one of you. Lastly, you can help by also donating to the Coral Reef and helping us fix a huge part of our ecosystem, we won't be jealous, we promise. Any amount can truly make a big impact. Do not forget Indiegogo has sharing tools as well that can help us get our name out there and make a big splash!!!!

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With launching a new service into the world, there are risks and challenges. We feel confident that the risk for this project is very low. We are ready to begin our production process once our funding goal is hit. Our team is 100% ready to bring Refresh Basics sustainable underwear into the world. Generally the biggest risk on any crowdfunding platform is for unknown delays in manufacturing. Things can always change along the way when bringing a new product into the world for the first time. With a sustainably produced product and service in the circular economy, there are many obstacles to tackle and we are ready to take them all on. </p>
<p>This isn't our first start-up and we are ready to tackle any unforeseen issues that come our way. We plan to bring Refresh Basics in its most sustainable and simple to use format as outlined on this project. All information we disclose in updates, in the comments and in private or direct messages in this campaign or through emails is subject to change as we move through production. There may be critical decisions we need to make moving forward that we did not foresee or that we cannot control. Our ultimate goal is to deliver your men’s underwear basics to our supporters and the world!</p>
<p>Our business is underwear basics for men and we want to feel as good in our souls as we do in our underwear. There is value to be found across all of our business processes and we are passionate about optimising every step for waste reduction and sustainability, from start to end and back again. We try to improve every day to be better for the next day. We're not superheroes, but we know we need to do something.</p>

Our patented Flash Knit technology will keep your feet dry, whatever the season. Don't compromise style for functionality with Vessi's.      Puddle Proof and Easy To CleanNo need to avoid those puddles ever again. Our Flash Knit material allows for easy cleaning thanks to Vessi's hydrophobic surface treatment. 100% Protected up to your ankles.Complete protection all the way up to your ankles. Vessi's upper is built from our proprietary one-piece circle knitting manufacturing process. No seams to allow water to come through.Breathable and Moisture Wicking. Unlike other waterproof shoes, Vessi's Flash Knit upper allows your feet to breathe, reducing sweat and odor build up. 


 
 Please note that these are sample colors and may slightly change   Vessi's Flash Knit is built with 3 Distinct Functional LayersThe Nano-Filtering Membrane and the heart of Vessi's upper is a waterproof and moisture-wicking layer that keeps your feet dry while allowing moisture from your sweat and body heat to escape the shoe. Being waterproof means that the area of your feet covered by Vessi shoes is completely impervious to water. This is not a coating and the waterproofing function will last the lifespan of the shoe.The Stretch Knit Layer of the Vessi upper is a knitted layer composed of a blend of polyester and nylon. We chose this specific blend to create an elastic yet durable knit that stretches to the shape of your feet. This encourages you to move naturally.The Comfort Lining is designed to mimic the feeling of wearing socks. It is soft to the touch and form-fitting.Traditional waterproof shoes tend to be stuffy and make your feet sweat and stink due to its lack of ability to regulate the dispersal of moisture. However, Vessi’s moisture-wicking technology regulates the dispersal of moisture thus reducing feet sweat and the buildup of odor.Vzero MidsolesIn addition to Vessi’s knit features are it's ultra lightweight Vzero midsoles. The composition of these Vzero’s is designed to maximize energy return while providing flexibility and cushioning for every step. The outsole is enhanced with rubber treads for traction in all weather conditions. The sole’s hardness and density are optimized for a perfect balance of lightness and comfort. Vessi will provide you with complete protection against water penetration while water repellent or resistant shoes just repel or resist water to a limited degree and will eventually start getting wet after a short period of time.Waterproof is the highest level of protection against water. Vessi shoes are waterproof which means it will provide you with complete protection against water penetration and keep your feet dry no matter what. Water-repellent is a level down; it is not as easily penetrated by water but you will only stay dry for a short time when exposed to water, rain, or any moisture. Water-resistant is the lowest level of water protection. These products are designed to make water penetration more difficult, water can still easily penetrate when the products are exposed to water or moisture for a very short period of time. If you submerge your feet in water-resistant shoes, your socks and feet will be soaking wet.  Our waterproof and moisture-wicking test. The below image shows a red nano-filtering membrane separating water and air. The membrane layer allows air to escape (breathability) yet is impervious to the water.

       Sizing Comparison | Vessi's sizing is similar to the fit of many popular running shoes (within a few mm longer than most).Half Sizes | If you typically wear ½ sizes, we recommend sizing up for a more relaxed fit or sizing down for a snug fit. Full Sizes | If you typically wear a full size, we recommend the same size for the best possible fit and comfort.Size Exchanges | Getting the perfect fit can be difficult especially online. It’s our mission that you get the best possible fit with your Vessi's. Send us a message and we’ll be happy to help you out. Still not sure about your size? Here's how you can measure for the right fit.
Place a piece of paper against the wall. Place one foot on the piece of paper with your heel against the wall. 
Trace around your feet making sure not to move your heel. 
Measure your marking from the highest point of your toes to the middle of the heel in cm and add 5 mm. 
Take the resulting figure and compare this to the JP/CM part of our chart. 
 Our Size Exchange Policy 
If there is a need for an exchange, we will need to charge for the shipping both ways as we are a startup and work with a limited budget. Thank you all for understanding. We will do our best to negotiate with the courier for the most economical shipping for you. This is true for all North American and international orders.

</h3>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530652008/n5jtg2ymjsjfdrouvost.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Science of the Sole</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529932750/qrcogzthyyk0779bjndf.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>Unlike the typical dress flat,""The Dream"" is a <i>true</i> flat, meaning the OESH Sole is completely flat from heel to toe and side to side in the forefoot region.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple. OESH Founder Dr. Kerrigan's published research on walking, running and the effects of footwear on the body has uncovered that even a small heel elevation, along with other, often hidden, features in traditional women's dress shoes, abnormally increase impact on the knee and other joints in the body.</p>
<p>The increased impact on the knees may help explain why women are twice as likely as men to develop knee osteoarthritis over a lifetime.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529693962/o2yguei1lzdzd1k3yzrw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>OESH Soles are made flat from a uniquely springy material that stays flat without developing unwanted contours over time, giving your foot and body the stable foundation you've never had in a women's dress shoe. The springy Sole, made of the highest performance elastomeric material possible, based on years of biomechanical data, is precisely tuned to give you the stability, comfort and performance you could only DREAM of in a dress shoe.</p>
<h2>Form Follows Function</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529695387/njc5c3uifhfwldvqwdkn.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Driven by Dr. Kerrigan's research and inspired by the lifestyles of active women, the Dream is designed to make you feel incredible all day long, whether its hustling around an office, running around town or dancing in the rain. Its design is wonderfully versatile, and comfortably transitions from a day of work to a night out in the city. </p>
<p>Most dress flats are narrower in the forefoot and toe box than most women's forefoot and toes are naturally. Try tracing your bare foot on a piece of paper, then trace a pair of dress shoes you wear on top. More likely than not, the outline of your foot at the toes fits OUTSIDE the outline of the shoe! Consistently squeezing your forefoot and toes into shoes with a narrow forefoot and toe box not only hurts, decreases your circulation and permanently deforms the shape of your feet, it has negative effects on the joints above your foot as well. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oeshshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/flat-outlines-small.gif"" src=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529351220/qcr3cx5l8l5iyuhof0v7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> At OESH, we don't think deforming your forefoot and toes and compromising your foot's natural function is especially attractive. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Instead, we believe your natural feminine foot shape, which is wider in the forefoot and narrower in the heel compared to men, <i>is </i>beautiful.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And functional.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Unique Stretchy Sock-Like Upper</h2>
<p>A soft stretchy knit upper gently hugs your foot without bunching up or digging in while enabling further movement in your foot and toes. This is in contrast to your usual shoe upper material which hardly even accommodates the change in your foot size that occurs throughout the day. How are we able to do this? With a unique combined experience in both biomechanics and manufacturing. The upper is knitted on a computerized knitting machine with just the right amount of tension and stretchiness to accommodate all those natural foot size and shape changes. Bottomline, you can comfortably wear them all day and all night!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530884873/wrze9g7h0lepq6v8fpqr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div><h2>The Story of OESH</h2></div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529933089/ljlmlssmq2f2qgvq0h5y.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>OESH Shoes was born from Dr. Casey Kerrigan's 20 years of research on the biomechanics of walking and running and the effect of footwear on the body. Dr. Kerrigan received an M.D. from Harvard Medical School which just featured her unlikely journey from medicine to footwear in the current issue of <a href=""http://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/cost-conflict/ground"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harvard Medicine Magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Her discoveries that heel elevation and other features in traditional women's dress shoes not only hurt the foot but also increase impact on the knees and other joints, have been featured in Glamour, Mademoiselle, the New York Times, Prevention, Newsweek,<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvbD2_vcQlo&amp;t=2s"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> ABC's 20/20</a> and other news. Her specialty of physical medicine and rehabilitation has to do with performance and the long-term health and well-being of the whole body. With over a hundred peer-reviewed research publications, she dreamed of a better shoe. But to make it would require developing an entirely new sole material and design. So, she built a factory and started developing and making. Since 2011 women all over the world are now wearing OESH and <a href=""http://oeshshoes.com/testimonials/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">telling us how much they love them</a>. </p>

<h2>Innovation</h2>
<p>OESH is uniquely committed to innovation and research. OESH is the <i>only</i> shoe company that is recognized by the U.S. National Science Foundation with a Phase I and Phase II Small Business Innovation Research Award for footwear manufacturing. In 2016, Dr. Kerrigan was recognized as one of the top 100 woman leaders in manufacturing (and the <i>only</i> leader in footwear manufacturing) by the U.S. Manufacturing Institute with a STEP (Science, Technology, Engineering and Production) Ahead Award. In April 2018, OESH Shoes was awarded the ""Innovator of the Year"" Award by the Charlottesville Business Innovation Council at its 20th Anniversary Gala Celebration.</p>
<p>Integral to developing the OESH Dream was creating numerous prototypes using a proprietary 3D printing process which OESH specially developed to print its elastomeric material. With support from the National Science Foundation, OESH continues to refine its novel 3D printing process and currently uses it not only to prototype new footwear styles but also to manufacture in their entirety, our award-winning <a href=""http://oeshshoes.com/product-category/sandal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Athena and Artemis sandal soles</a>. </p>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529933244/z5mxlopzlfndkju8wzzr.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Dr. Kerrigan's research informs a shoe design that is not only easier on the body, but also easier on the planet. The t<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>raditional shoe design typically combines numerous needless and often unhealthy materials bonded to one another with toxic VOC laden adhesives and primers.</span></p>
<p>The Dream ballet flat is simplistic in design with only three main components: the upper which is  knit all in one piece and hand sewn to minimize waste and maximize wear, a proprietary non-vinyl elastic spring Sole that is easier on workers and on the environment than the typical vinyl rubber and EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) used in the shoe industry, and a removable insole that is similarly devoid of vinyl. Because the Sole is a single unit and does not contain any vinyls, it obviates the need for any of the toxic <a href=""https://www.witpress.com/elibrary/wit-transactions-on-the-built-environment/128/20810"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VOC adhesives</a> and primers typically used in the industry. </p>
<h2>Testimonials &amp; Customer Service</h2>
<p>OESHers around the world have been loving the unique spring and fit of OESH Shoes for years. If you get a chance, you can see the enormous amount of feedback we regularly post on the <a href=""http://oeshshoes.com/testimonials/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OESHers Say</a> page of the website. And we have hundreds of reviews on Google and Facebook with sterling ratings of 4.8 and 4.7--exceptional for any apparel company but nearly unheard of for a footwear brand. We believe these reviews are due to our eagerness to listen and improve OESH Footwear where and when we can. As long as suggestions can be met in the realm of peer-reviewed medical science, we weigh the merits of great ideas constantly. The upshot is that OESH, without question, has the most sophisticated and educated consumer base in the footwear world. Our respect for OESHers is the spine of our business--and our excellent, fair, yet firm execution of consistent Customer Service speaks directly to this relationship.</p>

<p>OESH is based in Charlottesville, Virginia where all OESH Footwear are designed, developed and tested. Like several of our footwear lines, your Dreams will be made and shipped back to the Charlottesville Factory by ocean vessels from our manufacturing team in Jinjiang, China. OESH then Fulfills your order from Charlottesville directly to your home. This means Dr. Kerrigan doesn't have to knit every pair of uppers by hand! Rather, hundreds of computerized knitting machines like the one Dr. Kerrigan is programming above in Jinjiang, will be used to create the stretchy knit uppers.</p>
<p>OESH has been working with the same manufacturing team for many years, and our close relationship continues to benefit both sides of the Pacific. Pictured above are Managing Directors Charlie and Yvonne with Dr. Kerrigan and her youngest daughter on the Dream development trip earlier in 2018. We are especially pleased with the long-term health benefits our focus on Sustainability (above) creates for those we work with in Asia.

The Science of the Sole

Unlike the typical dress flat,""The Dream"" is a true flat, meaning the OESH Sole is completely flat from heel to toe and side to side in the forefoot region.
The reason for this is simple. OESH Founder Dr. Kerrigan's published research on walking, running and the effects of footwear on the body has uncovered that even a small heel elevation, along with other, often hidden, features in traditional women's dress shoes, abnormally increase impact on the knee and other joints in the body.
The increased impact on the knees may help explain why women are twice as likely as men to develop knee osteoarthritis over a lifetime.
 
 

OESH Soles are made flat from a uniquely springy material that stays flat without developing unwanted contours over time, giving your foot and body the stable foundation you've never had in a women's dress shoe. The springy Sole, made of the highest performance elastomeric material possible, based on years of biomechanical data, is precisely tuned to give you the stability, comfort and performance you could only DREAM of in a dress shoe.
Form Follows Function
Driven by Dr. Kerrigan's research and inspired by the lifestyles of active women, the Dream is designed to make you feel incredible all day long, whether its hustling around an office, running around town or dancing in the rain. Its design is wonderfully versatile, and comfortably transitions from a day of work to a night out in the city. 
Most dress flats are narrower in the forefoot and toe box than most women's forefoot and toes are naturally. Try tracing your bare foot on a piece of paper, then trace a pair of dress shoes you wear on top. More likely than not, the outline of your foot at the toes fits OUTSIDE the outline of the shoe! Consistently squeezing your forefoot and toes into shoes with a narrow forefoot and toe box not only hurts, decreases your circulation and permanently deforms the shape of your feet, it has negative effects on the joints above your foot as well. 
 
 At OESH, we don't think deforming your forefoot and toes and compromising your foot's natural function is especially attractive. 
Instead, we believe your natural feminine foot shape, which is wider in the forefoot and narrower in the heel compared to men, is beautiful.
And functional.

Unique Stretchy Sock-Like Upper
A soft stretchy knit upper gently hugs your foot without bunching up or digging in while enabling further movement in your foot and toes. This is in contrast to your usual shoe upper material which hardly even accommodates the change in your foot size that occurs throughout the day. How are we able to do this? With a unique combined experience in both biomechanics and manufacturing. The upper is knitted on a computerized knitting machine with just the right amount of tension and stretchiness to accommodate all those natural foot size and shape changes. Bottomline, you can comfortably wear them all day and all night!

The Story of OESH
OESH Shoes was born from Dr. Casey Kerrigan's 20 years of research on the biomechanics of walking and running and the effect of footwear on the body. Dr. Kerrigan received an M.D. from Harvard Medical School which just featured her unlikely journey from medicine to footwear in the current issue of Harvard Medicine Magazine.
Her discoveries that heel elevation and other features in traditional women's dress shoes not only hurt the foot but also increase impact on the knees and other joints, have been featured in Glamour, Mademoiselle, the New York Times, Prevention, Newsweek, ABC's 20/20 and other news. Her specialty of physical medicine and rehabilitation has to do with performance and the long-term health and well-being of the whole body. With over a hundred peer-reviewed research publications, she dreamed of a better shoe. But to make it would require developing an entirely new sole material and design. So, she built a factory and started developing and making. Since 2011 women all over the world are now wearing OESH and telling us how much they love them.

Innovation
OESH is uniquely committed to innovation and research. OESH is the only shoe company that is recognized by the U.S. National Science Foundation with a Phase I and Phase II Small Business Innovation Research Award for footwear manufacturing. In 2016, Dr. Kerrigan was recognized as one of the top 100 woman leaders in manufacturing (and the only leader in footwear manufacturing) by the U.S. Manufacturing Institute with a STEP (Science, Technology, Engineering and Production) Ahead Award. In April 2018, OESH Shoes was awarded the ""Innovator of the Year"" Award by the Charlottesville Business Innovation Council at its 20th Anniversary Gala Celebration.
Integral to developing the OESH Dream was creating numerous prototypes using a proprietary 3D printing process which OESH specially developed to print its elastomeric material. With support from the National Science Foundation, OESH continues to refine its novel 3D printing process and currently uses it not only to prototype new footwear styles but also to manufacture in their entirety, our award-winning Athena and Artemis sandal soles. 
Sustainability
Dr. Kerrigan's research informs a shoe design that is not only easier on the body, but also easier on the planet. The traditional shoe design typically combines numerous needless and often unhealthy materials bonded to one another with toxic VOC laden adhesives and primers.
The Dream ballet flat is simplistic in design with only three main components: the upper which is  knit all in one piece and hand sewn to minimize waste and maximize wear, a proprietary non-vinyl elastic spring Sole that is easier on workers and on the environment than the typical vinyl rubber and EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate) used in the shoe industry, and a removable insole that is similarly devoid of vinyl. Because the Sole is a single unit and does not contain any vinyls, it obviates the need for any of the toxic VOC adhesives and primers typically used in the industry. 
Testimonials & Customer Service
OESHers around the world have been loving the unique spring and fit of OESH Shoes for years. If you get a chance, you can see the enormous amount of feedback we regularly post on the OESHers Say page of the website. And we have hundreds of reviews on Google and Facebook with sterling ratings of 4.8 and 4.7--exceptional for any apparel company but nearly unheard of for a footwear brand. We believe these reviews are due to our eagerness to listen and improve OESH Footwear where and when we can. As long as suggestions can be met in the realm of peer-reviewed medical science, we weigh the merits of great ideas constantly. The upshot is that OESH, without question, has the most sophisticated and educated consumer base in the footwear world. Our respect for OESHers is the spine of our business--and our excellent, fair, yet firm execution of consistent Customer Service speaks directly to this relationship.
          
But even we have been blown away with the first comments from women wearing the Dream:
""Jinkies! Those are comfortable!""
-Cassie, New Haven
""I usually wear sneakers for my commute, but if I was wearing these, I would never take them off!""
-Katie, Vienna
""...Can I keep these?"" 
-Becca, Cambridge

Timeline


Team 

OESH is based in Charlottesville, Virginia where all OESH Footwear are designed, developed and tested. Like several of our footwear lines, your Dreams will be made and shipped back to the Charlottesville Factory by ocean vessels from our manufacturing team in Jinjiang, China. OESH then Fulfills your order from Charlottesville directly to your home. This means Dr. Kerrigan doesn't have to knit every pair of uppers by hand! Rather, hundreds of computerized knitting machines like the one Dr. Kerrigan is programming above in Jinjiang, will be used to create the stretchy knit uppers.
OESH has been working with the same manufacturing team for many years, and our close relationship continues to benefit both sides of the Pacific. Pictured above are Managing Directors Charlie and Yvonne with Dr. Kerrigan and her youngest daughter on the Dream development trip earlier in 2018. We are especially pleased with the long-term health benefits our focus on Sustainability (above) creates for those we work with in Asia. This is an essential virtue of backing OESH and one where we again lead the shoe industry by doing the right thing for our entire Team.
Established soon after OESH began rolling volume through our Charlottesville factory, this international partnership combines hundreds of hands working together to make a line of finished shoes. Impressively, OESH has carved a unique fit and manufacturing process within the hub of world-wide footwear making, allowing us to produce beautiful shoes in high volume--one finished pair at a time. A proven long-term partnership ensures that the shoes you receive are well made with the highest quality materials, for our most comfortable, practical, and stylish shoe yet.

<p>Our main challenge was to find out why No-Show socks ALWAYS roll of the feet. It took us over 8 months of research and development to figure out the root of the problem, and to come up with the perfect solution for a one size fit. Most No-Show socks on the market also have a silicone strip on the heel, but they still roll off. We found however, that the Silicone most brands use, the Size and Pattern of their silicone strip, and its Position, is not helping the socks to stay up. We have taken all these four points to another level, and created socks that stay up the whole day.</p>

<p>Our second challenge was to figure out why feet smell, even when we wear socks. We found out that our feet, on an average, produce over 17oz (500ml) of sweat per day. And since bacteria love to feed on sweat, it gives off a strong smell as it eliminates waste products. So it’s not the sweat itself that stinks, it’s the by-products of the bacteria living of your sweat. That is why we decided to collaborate with a European manufacturer of a patented, organic anti-microbial solution for textiles. All our socks are anti-microbial treated, meaning that we will dramatically reduce the germs in your socks and shoes, hence reduce the unwanted smells.</p>

<h2>The Brellabag - cause it's waterproof </h2>
<h2><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/467195/pictures/original/20120930102345-IMG_7184.JPG?1349025824"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<h3><strong><em>W</em>ie alles begann</strong></h3>
<p>So haben wir es oft erlebet : Schnell den Taschenschirm aufspannen und zur Metro laufen. Uff, gerade noch und einen Platz ergattert ...</p>
<p>Wohin nun mit dem tropfnassen Regenschirm?</p>
<p>Zusammenfalten, in die Hülle stecken und zurück in die Handtasche? Aber halt! Die Hülle ist ja nicht wasserdicht und wird feucht. Zurück in die Handtasche geht kaum, denn Handy, Papiere und Geldbörse müssen trocken bleiben.</p>
<p>Wer braucht denn so was? Ständig den nassen Schirm auf sicheren Abstand in der Hand tragen oder abstellen und wieder einmal vergessen? Das ist doch nervig!</p>
<p>Unsere Idee ist eine wasserdichte Regenschirmhülle, die schnell über den Schirm gestreift werden kann und der Schirm danach getrost in der Handtasche verschwindet.</p>
<p>Das ist der Brellabag! Eine wasserdichte Regenschirmhülle, leicht und unkompliziert, in verschiedenen Farben und für gängige Taschenschirmgrößen.</p>

<h3><strong><em>W</em>hat is the story</strong></h3>
<p>Rather than throwing your soaking wet umbrella in your bag wouldn’t you feel better quickly sliding it into a secure waterproof bag, rather than into a conventional bag that is not waterproof?</p>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><em>W</em>hat is the Brellabag</strong></div>
<div>The Brellabag is a waterproof umbrellabag that protects all the valuables inside your bag : It keeps the rain out of your handbag!</div>

<h3><strong><em>W</em>hat we aim for</strong></h3>
<strong>Work space &gt;</strong> the main thing we are hoping to get out of this campaign is a great work space. We have been working in cafes and even at the kitchen table.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Market research &gt;</strong> we would also like to perform market research to better understand the needs of Brellabag users, and do a top branding campaign.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Develop the product &gt;</strong> we would like to further develop the Brellabag. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Manufacturing &gt;</strong> to prepare for the next step - manufacturing and bringing the Brellabag onto the shelves.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Be part of it &gt; </strong>the Brellabag is just a start. We are working on more ideas and we would love you to be part of the journey by helping to bring the Brellabag to market.

Many thanks to all of you! You made it happen!
 
The Brellabag - cause it's waterproof 

Wie alles begann
So haben wir es oft erlebet : Schnell den Taschenschirm aufspannen und zur Metro laufen. Uff, gerade noch und einen Platz ergattert ...
Wohin nun mit dem tropfnassen Regenschirm?
Zusammenfalten, in die Hülle stecken und zurück in die Handtasche? Aber halt! Die Hülle ist ja nicht wasserdicht und wird feucht. Zurück in die Handtasche geht kaum, denn Handy, Papiere und Geldbörse müssen trocken bleiben.
Wer braucht denn so was? Ständig den nassen Schirm auf sicheren Abstand in der Hand tragen oder abstellen und wieder einmal vergessen? Das ist doch nervig!
Unsere Idee ist eine wasserdichte Regenschirmhülle, die schnell über den Schirm gestreift werden kann und der Schirm danach getrost in der Handtasche verschwindet.
Das ist der Brellabag! Eine wasserdichte Regenschirmhülle, leicht und unkompliziert, in verschiedenen Farben und für gängige Taschenschirmgrößen.

What is the story
Rather than throwing your soaking wet umbrella in your bag wouldn’t you feel better quickly sliding it into a secure waterproof bag, rather than into a conventional bag that is not waterproof?
 
What is the Brellabag
The Brellabag is a waterproof umbrellabag that protects all the valuables inside your bag : It keeps the rain out of your handbag!
 
 

 

What are the benefits
 


Waterproof - protects all your valuables


Easy to handle – slide in quickly


Flexible - fits all sizes of umbrellas


Lightweight - no extra weight


Stylish - comes in different colours and styles


 
What more about the Brellabag

Neoprene
25cm long
fits umbrellas 20cm to 29cm

 
What we aim for
Work space > the main thing we are hoping to get out of this campaign is a great work space. We have been working in cafes and even at the kitchen table.
 

Market research > we would also like to perform market research to better understand the needs of Brellabag users, and do a top branding campaign.
 

Develop the product > we would like to further develop the Brellabag. 
 

Manufacturing > to prepare for the next step - manufacturing and bringing the Brellabag onto the shelves.
 

Be part of it > the Brellabag is just a start. We are working on more ideas and we would love you to be part of the journey by helping to bring the Brellabag to market. 
 
How can you help

<h2><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h2>
<p>Joe Dunbar Designs is located in beautiful Talent, Oregon. Joe Dunbar and Lynae Williams have created a fashion house where designers and artists can come together to fulfill their artistic vision. They focus on one of a kind garments from ready to wear clothing to evening and bridal as well as costumes for theater, dance, and movies. All of the projects are made in their studio in Talent.</p>
<p>The design house is a teaching facility where interns can come learn and help create garments in the studio. Joe and Lynae continue to learn, try new techniques and push creative boundaries. Joe Dunbar Designs has had 8 interns that have mentored with the team and the majority of them have continued in the fashion industry.</p>
<p>Joe Dunbar earned his degree in apparel design in Portland, Oregon where he also had his own bridal shop. In addition to designing, Joe is a gifted painter and artist.</p>
<p>Lynae has a degree in apparel design from the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising. She was one of Joe's first interns and now works beside Joe.</p>
<h2><strong>Our Project</strong></h2>
<p>We are shooting a documentary style movie that encompasses the creative process behind initiating and executing a full scale fashion show. </p>
<p>Director Kadi Carlson, originally from southern Oregon and now an LA resident, will be shooting the film with her crew. Kadi is currently a student at AI, graduating in June 2013.</p>
<p>The runway portion of the documentary will be filmed August 2nd through the 5th.</p>
<div>Currently, we are in the preliminary stages of planning the event. The fashion show itself will include three sections:
<ul>
<li>Party Dresses, featuring our signature little black dresses</li>
<li>Costumes, including theatrical and dance</li>
<li>Finale, showcasing both bridal and evening gowns</li>
</ul>
<p>The show will feature new looks, which are currently in the design phase as wall as classic pieces from our archives. The documentary will showcase the process of sketching through the completion of garments as well as the final show.</p>
<p>This documentary will not only feature the design house and it's garments, but will also provide a behind the scenes look at all components of a fashion show. The models, make up artists, and hair stylists will have the opportunity to be showcased for their craft.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">We will be using 10 models (with two alternates) to walk in our show, which we are currently casting for. Some of the models we are using have started their careers walking in Joe Dunbar Designs shows throughout the years. Hair and make up artists are being selected by both Joe Dunbar Designs and Kadi Carlson.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>The most difficult part of the completion of this project will be to keep all the creative talent flowing in one direction that makes everyone satisfied with the end product.</div>

<p>The garments are currently being made, models have been cast, and the crew is being gathered by both Joe Dunbar and Kadi Carlson. There will naturally be some last minute switches, but the design team and film crew feel well-prepared to handle any changes that may arise.</p>
<p>The Joe Dunbar Designs crew has worked on several productions including theater, ballet, movies and many runway shows. The team is used to the fast-paced and constantly changing environment on set and during preparation.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Gangfeather was created by the two fine artist sisters Lauren Stout and Ashley West in the summer of 2010.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Lauren: ""The timing was impeccable, I had just come back from Spain and Ashley had graduated from high school. We entered our music video in the video contest for the band The Prodigy in January 2010, where I had drawn the gangfeather symbol on our faces. Ashley later digitized the symbol and gave our brand its name.""</p>
<p>Ashley: ""I remember liking the image concept Lauren had created.  I even tried to incorporate it into my concentration for my AP 2D Art class last year.  I was sitting at the computer with the image pulled up on Photoshop.  I previously had digitized the image, drawing my own version of it on Photoshop. I pondered what the title of the piece should be. It looked like a feather, but It also looked like a gang sign. I literally put to and two together and came up with gangfeather!  The name would also be very simple to explain.""</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Gangfeather will close the gap between fine art and street wear. We're not JUST a skater brand, we're not JUST a trendy brand, there are no boundaries. Our designs all begin as little sparks in our brains, otherwise known as ideas. These ideas get developed in sketch books and later adapted to garments by screen printing or hot press.  </p>
<p>If we aren't able to raise enough funds, we wont be able to create our clothing line or go to the apparel markets. It's very hard to support a business with what little income we already get from our art projects on the side.  Please help us find our place in the career we're absolutely passionate about!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $7000 to help pay for our 2011 fall and winter line. The money will be used to pay our screenprinter, our branding items aka hangtags and etc., marketing, and a booth at the apparel market.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please tell everyone you know about gangfeather. If you don't have enough time to explain to your friends just tell them to look us up on Indiegogo. Thank you all for your support. It is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>When I met Harbor it was love at first sight!  She went EVERYWHERE with me. When she started getting bigger a lot of people kept telling me how handsome she was, and that drove me insane.  I looked everywhere for a dog collar that would tell the world that Harbor was a lady!   I couldn't find anything, and started making my own.

<h3>Harbor was getting quite the reaction with her new collar.  Everywhere I took her someone had something to say about it.   They loved it, and wanted to know where they could get one for their dog.

</div></div>","After a successful pre-sale crowdfunding campaign we are excited to bring Hardin backpacks to Indegogo! The good folks at Indiegogo felt that our backpacks were up to the task and offered to feature us in the InDemand section. There are no early-bird specials, but if you place an order by February 29th we can promise shipment in March. Thanks for stopping by and checking out our campaign, feel free to message us with questions or concerns.The current day bag market is flooded with low quality products. The current backpacks are too focused on gimmicks and overly complicated designs. We were tired of losing our headphones in the abyss of a 9-compartment backpack while breaking the one-way zipper.
We adapted a classic military design to fit your daily life. We focused on simple features and kept a clean look.  All materials are American-sourced and the bag is sewn in Southern California. The backpack is built to last a lifetime and you may never need to buy another day bag.


47cm x 26cm x 18cm - 21L Capacity 1.3lbs (21oz)

We offer two color options: OD Green & Black




No zippers means less moving parts thus less to break. The design relies on a folding closure system than can also be locked. (see video)





No plastic EVER. We only use metal components.



The patches on the shoulder straps pay tribute to a lot of wasted hours at the beach...




Hidden interior Velcro pocket (left). Exterior pocket with pen holder and metal snap.

1000 DENIER Weatherproof CORDURA® Brand (Exterior)

are on the verge of launching the first glossy magazine that combines
naughtiness with a touch of art, a slice of fetish, a lot of engagement and a

ET
ALORS? 

The
first flamboyant style magazine about fun, fashion, fetish, art, gender, literature, gay, culture,
glamour and icons. 

 

4x a year

In English

10.000 copies

260 pages

Worldwide distribution
1st. issue = december 2011

 

Our personal references:

After getting the degree of licentiate in history of art and
communication, Fleur Pierets spent the following ten years running Glamor
Is Undead. A cultural event organisation with customers such as
Kunstenfestival/des Arts Brussels, Antwerp Open, Fashion Museum Antwerp and
Cultuurcentrum Mechelen.  She freelances
as a journalist for Elle 
and the Dutch art magazine Isel.  She
will be the guest editor-in-chief for the January 2012 issue “Women in Arts” of
Isel.

Her
partner, Paulien Boom, is travelling around the world as a freelance hydrographer.
Next to being a Drag king model, she’s also one of the most important
spokeswomen within the transgender community in Amsterdam. 

 

Due to our preference for exclusivity,  Et
Alors?  will be printed on 10.000
copies. We create most of our content ourselves for which we are collaborating
with a large scale of artists, writers and photographers.  

 

We will feature interviews, photos, art and illustrations from an
International collection of artists, musicians and cultural catalysts. Et Alors? fills the gaps between a
naughty lifestyle, special-interest publications and style. With a high class
take on the people and things we love. Art, music, culture, and sex coexist
interdependently, just like they do in our everyday lives. Our contributors and
features span diverse ethnicities, nationalities, genders, opinions and media.
With more practice than theory, more kink than censorship, and more subversion
than advertising. 

 

Our target groups are open-minded inspired men and women, higher social classes executing rewarding jobs and with a
tendency to spend their money on high quality, visually attractive and original
trendy goods. They can fall in love with a piece of art and are looking forward
to be surprised by things they never heard about. Just  to get their brains tickled. They do not mind
a naughty word or two either, as long as it sounds stylish.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As of today, I am no longer seeking Backers to Help me with Funds to hire an attorney to write &amp; file my 2 other very Important FULL Patent Applications for my 'NEW INVENTION' at this time for my '360 DEGREE HANDS-FREE DOG LEASH ATTACHMENT UNIT'!  Since, I could not show my Full Invention right now, I have failed to raise any Funds besides my own to do so. I did receive about 900 Visitors to my Indiegogo Fundraiser's Campaign Page during the first week and even days after that from people in many countries around The World!!! I also had some good people who referred other's to my Campaign Page too. ! I do Thank everyone of YOU for your time.  Right now, I am trying to learn as much as I can about the Full Patenting Process. I have also learned that I can get some assistance on How to fill/complete &amp; file my 2 patent applications through programs at the Unites States Patent and Trademark Office, the internet and other ways too. I will still need about $3,500 to $4,000 to pay all fees to file these applications. I will let 'GOD &amp; JESUS CHRIST'  make a way for me to pay for my patents. Then, I will be able to show this 'Great Invention to THE WORLD'!<br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Once I have filed both of my patents before May of the year 2016, My '360 DEGREE HANDS-FREE DOG LEASH ATTACHMENT UNIT'  Will-be-Back!  Said it like ""The Terminator""  'The Great Arnold Schwarzenegger'! <br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Thanks again to all visitors to my Indeigogo Crowdfunding Campaign Page from around The World for your time!

</div><div>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">AND, ON NOVEMBER 13, 2015, THIS TIME I CALLED <b>THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE LEGAL DEPARTMENT FOR MORE ADVICE!</b>  AGAIN, I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE I ENTERED LOTS OF INFO INTO MY PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FILED ON MAY 5, 2015,  AND, IF I DO NOT SUCCEED IN RAISING FUNDS TO HIRE A PATENT ATTORNEY TO FILE A NON-PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION &amp; A PCT INTERNATIONAL PATENT APPLICATION BY MAY OF 2016, MY FULL INVENTION WILL BE OUT THERE WITHOUT NO PATENT PROTECTION FOR ANYONE TO PRODUCE AND TO SELL!    To everyone out there, you must understand how this would be devastating to me... So, Please bear with me until these 2 patents have been filed by an attorney!   MY FUTURE BACKERS, You have my word that this Invention under those towels in my video/s will be shown to all Backers first after patents are filed!  You will be informed about all of my attorney's patenting progress as it would take place!!!  Thank You!    </p>

<h1><b>Hello To all of my Potential Backers! </b></h1>
<p></p>
<p> My name is Andrew Jasmine Sr.   </p>
<p>About this Invention!  I have created the Ultimate '360 DEGREE HANDS-FREE DOG LEASH ATTACHMENT UNIT'!  It is adjustable and worn over the lower hip area and it wraps around the body. I have seen dog owners 'time and time again', while walking or jogging with their dog, have to keep switching their leash from one hand to the other in front and behind their backs. Then as their dog takes off to any direction, their owner's arm is suddenly jerked unexpectedly to that direction. (((So one day, I envisioned these pet owners having a device that would be worn around their waist to Free their hands, as their dog ventures to any direction that he or she chooses?)))  Also, a device that would incorporate the user's weight (as a force) to hold back their dog and to prevent stress to the user's upper body.  </p>
<p>NOTE! I also have 4 other designs for this product. This Invention is ""Patent Pending"" right now, with plans to file a 'Non-Provisional Patent Application and a PCT International Patent Application' which will allow me 30 months to file a 'National Patent Application' in many other foreign countries Worldwide!  </p>

<h3>4. My Detour, Inventing Process &amp; my Philosophy!</h3>
<p>Before I started to create drawings of my visions of prototypes for this invention, I was in the process of working on the full details needed to file a 'Provisional Patent Application' for a prior invention that I had been working on for over 7 years. But, when I had told my oldest daughter about my new invention idea, she told me to stop on the 7 years invention and start the new invention idea Right Now. So, I took her advice and that is just what I did. </p>
<p>First, I drew design after design to find out what may work, and, what would not work 'while looking for' the 'perfect design &amp; operational/mechanical function'... Then, I use my own creative mind that 'God &amp; Jesus Christ' instilled in me to en-vision a futuristic device that people all over the World could &amp; would use. My design sketches can easily climb up to about several hundred typing paper sheets. Once, I feel that I have enough drawings to start with, then I start to focus on what materials that I can use that is already out there. The main stores that I used were: Lowes Hardware, Walmart, Academy Sporting Goods and Home Depot.   </p>
<p><b>My Philosophy on Creating an Invention Is?</b>  It takes Quality Time, Futuristic Thoughts, a Progressive Effort and, a Never-Giving-Up-Mentality.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>5. SUMMARY? </h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>My name is Andrew Jasmine Sr.  I am a father of 4 wonderful adult children and, a Paw-Paw to 4 Grandboys! I am a inventor. For now, (my Focus is on) I have Invented a <b>'360 DEGREE HANDS-FREE DOG LEASH ATTACHMENT UNIT' </b>for the Future of walking, jogging and being out-&amp;-about with your Dog!</p>
<p>ALSO, I decided to come to this crowdfunding site, because I cannot afford the expense to hire an attorney to file a full 'Non-Provisional &amp; a PCT International Patent Application' for my Invention!  So, I am seeking funding from Backers to do just that. 'IF' enough Funds are Raised, I will also be able to take my homemade prototype to a manufacturer to have it manufactured into a Finished Product! Once this is done, I will have a better idea of what it will look like and have full details, pictures and videos of this invention to present to all of my Backers First! Which includes all Backers of [ALL 4 PERKS]... Then, I will present my full disclosure of this finished product to the World thereafter?  </p>
<p>((( This New Invention will bring JOY, FUN, LESS STRESS &amp; HAPPINESS TO A PUP/DOG AND THEIR OWNERS ALIKE. )))      </p>
<span><b>To all of my Backers:</b> You will be helping &amp; assisting me to take my first ever Invention out to The World. You will help me to give pet/dog owners and their pup/dog lots more Freedom &amp; Love for each other, when they are out taking a walk or jogging... All ladies would appreciate it too!</span>

I also had some good people who referred other's to my Campaign Page too. ! I do Thank everyone of YOU for your time.  Right now, I am trying to learn as much as I can about the Full Patenting Process. I have also learned that I can get some assistance on How to fill/complete & file my 2 patent applications through programs at the Unites States Patent and Trademark Office, the internet and other ways too. I will still need about $3,500 to $4,000 to pay all fees to file these applications. I will let 'GOD & JESUS CHRIST'  make a way for me to pay for my patents. Then, I will be able to show this 'Great Invention to THE WORLD'!Once I have filed both of my patents before May of the year 2016, My '360 DEGREE HANDS-FREE DOG LEASH ATTACHMENT UNIT'  Will-be-Back!  Said it like ""The Terminator""  'The Great Arnold Schwarzenegger'! Thanks again to all visitors to my Indeigogo Crowdfunding Campaign Page from around The World for your time!

...NOTE...  To my Future Backers! Please read both paragraphs Below! Due to the advice given to me during October 2015, from 3 phone calls to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, I was instructed & advised that I should not disclose full details, which includes videos or pictures of my Invention on The Worldwide Web at this time!  But, it will eventually be done!  It's because, I only have a Provisional Patent Application currently on file, (AS A FIRST TO FILE DATE) and, I have plans to file a Complete 'USA' Non-Provisional Patent Application & a PCT International Patent Application for Foreign Countries of my choosing!!!  

AND, ON NOVEMBER 13, 2015, THIS TIME I CALLED THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE LEGAL DEPARTMENT FOR MORE ADVICE!  AGAIN, I WAS TOLD THAT BECAUSE I ENTERED LOTS OF INFO INTO MY PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION FILED ON MAY 5, 2015,  AND, IF I DO NOT SUCCEED IN RAISING FUNDS TO HIRE A PATENT ATTORNEY TO FILE A NON-PROVISIONAL PATENT APPLICATION & A PCT INTERNATIONAL PATENT APPLICATION BY MAY OF 2016, MY FULL INVENTION WILL BE OUT THERE WITHOUT NO PATENT PROTECTION FOR ANYONE TO PRODUCE AND TO SELL!    To everyone out there, you must understand how this would be devastating to me... So, Please bear with me until these 2 patents have been filed by an attorney!   MY FUTURE BACKERS, You have my word that this Invention under those towels in my video/s will be shown to all Backers first after patents are filed!  You will be informed about all of my attorney's patenting progress as it would take place!!!  Thank You!

((( This New Invention will bring JOY, FUN, LESS STRESS & HAPPINESS TO A DOG AND THEIR OWNERS ALIKE. )))        




Hello To all of my Potential Backers! 

 My name is Andrew Jasmine Sr.   
About this Invention!  I have created the Ultimate '360 DEGREE HANDS-FREE DOG LEASH ATTACHMENT UNIT'!  It is adjustable and worn over the lower hip area and it wraps around the body. I have seen dog owners 'time and time again', while walking or jogging with their dog, have to keep switching their leash from one hand to the other in front and behind their backs. Then as their dog takes off to any direction, their owner's arm is suddenly jerked unexpectedly to that direction. (((So one day, I envisioned these pet owners having a device that would be worn around their waist to Free their hands, as their dog ventures to any direction that he or she chooses?)))  Also, a device that would incorporate the user's weight (as a force) to hold back their dog and to prevent stress to the user's upper body.  
NOTE! I also have 4 other designs for this product. This Invention is ""Patent Pending"" right now, with plans to file a 'Non-Provisional Patent Application and a PCT International Patent Application' which will allow me 30 months to file a 'National Patent Application' in many other foreign countries Worldwide!   

 


Who am I? I am an Inventor. I have ideas to invent many things in the Future! 





 >>> PATENT PENDING <<<   GOING WORLDWIDE!  




 >>> PATENT PENDING <<<   GOING WORLDWIDE!  



(Jingle)   Spin-Around, Dog Leash goes Round and Around - Thump Thump!  Repeat...

ATTENTION!   ONCE BOTH PATENTS HAVE BEEN FILED, EVERY BACKER WHO SELECTS MY $25 PERK WILL  HAVE A CHANCE TO GIVE THIS AMAZING NEW INVENTION IT'S LIFETIME NAME!!! If your name is chosen, you could win a Prize? More Details to come!

'IF' enough Funds are Raised, I will also be able to take my homemade prototype to a manufacturer to have it manufactured into a Finished Product! Once this is done, I will have a better idea of what it will look like and have full details, pictures and videos of this invention to present to all of my Backers First! Which includes all Backers of [ALL 4 PERKS]... Then, I will present my full disclosure of this finished product to the World thereafter?  
((( This New Invention will bring JOY, FUN, LESS STRESS & HAPPINESS TO A PUP/DOG AND THEIR OWNERS ALIKE. )))      
To all of my Backers: You will be helping & assisting me to take my first ever Invention out to The World. You will help me to give pet/dog owners and their pup/dog lots more Freedom & Love for each other, when they are out taking a walk or jogging... All ladies would appreciate it too!

7. Risks & Challenges? 
As for any Risk! I hope to raise enough funds to file both patents! Just raising enough funds to cover the territories of the U.S.A. will complete only 1/2 of my Goals! I want to protect my 'UNITED STATES OF AMERICA' American Citizen Invention from being taken and manufactured by other's in other Major Countries around This World. This Invention was born on US Soil and, it needs PROTECTION! I will pursue a National Patent in the 10 most dog owners per household countries out THERE!   
AGAIN, SOME OF THESE TOP 10 FOREIGN COUNTRIES ARE:   Brazil, China, Russia, Japan, Philippines, India, Argentina, France, Romania & Norway! This list may change!!!  

...There are NO Challenges at this early stage for this Invention at this moment?... 


The magnitude of what Backers at the $25 Perk level will achieve is astounding and 4Life!

If the hospital has a major panic due to an outside public event (terrorism, fire, hazmat issue, natural disaster, airborne disease, etc.) and people rush the hospital, what can we do?  I [Vince] searched my trade magazines and wholesale catalogs for a product that may work, and reported back.  I'm sorry sir but there is <b>nothing </b>on the market that I can use to help you overcome this critical dilemma.  With great disappointment, he [The Director of Security] walked away.  Do understand, I [Vince] do not like to fail or disappoint a customer, especially when it comes to security and life safety.  Later that night, [personal initiative is always in full effect] I drove back to the hospital to examine his double sliding doors to come up with a solution.  After working into the night sketching and rendering out a new idea.  I made initial success on paper, at the moment!  But would my idea survive my brutally honest and merciless Patent Agent, and the professionals at the PTO who will do a worldwide historical search? I'm sorry, failure is not an option, so I played by all the rules and remained optimistic.  Four (4) long years later, after filing in 2009, the United States Patent and Trademark Office determined, this is indeed a new, novel, and beneficial solution. The birth of US Patent <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US8585105"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US8585105</a> . Something never thought of in the history of the world. [Huge celebration!!!] Please continue to follow this from conception to near reality.  [Many thanks!]</i></p><p>As you are aware. After the events of 9-11, the world as we used to know it was forever changed. All security measures have increased beyond the stratospheres. Vigilance, advanced planning, and locking people in and out is the main safety direction around the world.  This statement includes a desire for faster and more efficient locking mechanisms. There is a constant, well hidden scenario the general public is not aware of. That secret is, not all doors can be locked immediately in the event of an emergency. Imagine visiting one of the following: A hospital, especially schools, shopping mall, local drug store, large hardware store, hotel, large department store, government building, or any large or small private sector building.  Basically, any building with one, or more particular, multiple entrances.  In the wake of recent random shootings and other attacks, public  word comes across of an incident near your location. In a panic, one of reasonable sense would want to lock out any potential violence before it moves inside a building, or maybe isolate it if it's already in a building. If a hospital or mall had 37 double sliding doors to be locked, what would security do?  Let's try this one more time!  From the conception of sliding double doors (invented 60 years ago in 1954) up to the current year 2014. What would, could, should, security personnel do?????  The answer is RUN!!! Run to use a key, to lock all 37 sliding double doors. Imagine the time and panic in concluding this process. Did you know historically and at present, the only way to lock a double sliding door is to use an old fashioned hook latch and key? Yes, it's true!  Still the slow poke method.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/838781/files/20140906113618-Disher_Pete_locking03_12474.jpg?1410028578"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>One can remotely kill power to a double door but it can still be forced open.  There is <b>NOTHING </b>else on the market that can lock these type doors remotely - <b>UNTIL NOW</b>. After hearing so many complaints about this from Directors of Security in various buildings, a new idea and patented product was born. US Patent 8.585,105 discloses the solution. The <i><b>MoveNetic Magnetic Lock</b></i> has the ability to lock double sliding doors at the push of one button. Meaning, instead of running to lock 37 sliding doors as previously mentioned, one can do so instantly!  What makes this product work so efficiently? Simply, all magnetic locks are designed to be mounted to a stable, non-movable surface. Because all double sliding doors move away from each other. It is physically impossible to use this type lock or anything similar on these doors. [Curtain call for the MoveNetic Magnetic Lock]  Existing magnetic locking technologies will work on a single sliding door because the door slides towards the frame holding the door.  Not double sliding doors.   The MoveNetic lock allows both the magnetic lock (which in the past had to be mounted on a stable frame) and the strike plate to both move. Thus allowing remote locking of both doors immediately. Here's a fair question. So both doors are locked at the press of a button? What if the lock loses power? Answer - it won't. The lock is connected to a power supply with battery backup. Thus, if the primary power is loss, the batteries will keep the door(s) locked for many hours to come depending on the batteries installed. So Vince, how big is the market for this product?  Close your eyes and try to count how many sliding doors there are in every city in the United States.  How about, how many double sliding doors are on the planet? Good luck with that thought!!!!  I'm truly sorry to blow your mind with the thought [let's both reach for the Excedrin together] but let's agree it's a huge market.  Let's give some fair estimates. <b>There may be</b> <b>approximately 400+ million doors </b>[low estimate]<b> of this type just in this country alone,</b> <b>and zero devices </b>[official]<b> to protect them instantly except this one product</b>. Let's say it out loud together.  <b>THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF DOORS!!!! </b>Imagine the possibilities. </p><p><b>.....Keeping People In Is My Next Important Topic</b></p><p>Two more thoughts to consider.  I have discussed keeping people out but how about me explaining more real time scenarios?  Scenario 1 revolves around child theft.  What if someone tried to steal a baby from the same hospital as mentioned earlier?  Typically, are new born's are kept well inside the hospital.  If a situation arises where a child may be missing, one can instantly lock down the entire facility until the child is recovered. Thus, stopping the exit and passage of everyone in the building. </p><p>Scenario 2 might be a shopping store or similar and a child is suddenly missing. Or the potential for an abduction comes to the forefront.  The child does not respond to repeated pages on the store's intercom and the parents are going crazy searching!!!  Once again, instantly lock the store down to keep all parties in until the search is completed, and the child is found. This is a must have to match the type world we now live in. </p><p>The goal is to finish the prototyping development phase and travel to different companies in a similar industry to offer licensing rights.  If this does not go as planned then seek out a manufacturing partnership.  To keep moving forward with the project and not hold my breath waiting on others. I would be interested in forming a company and going into full development and manufacturing, setting up distribution, exciting those at trade shows, selling to the government and any other positive means to get this into the marketplace.  Review and enjoy the video for a complete understanding of this dynamic new product and its current direction. Let's be safer together!  Your consideration is truly appreciated and honored.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The patented linear power strip is the key that makes this work: </span><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/nynro9hq40nt83p/E_shaped_Mechanism_Previz_vr01.mp4?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/nynro9hq40nt83p/E_shaped_Mechanism_Previz_vr01.mp4?dl=0</a><br/></p><div>

<li>My name is John Harris and I am the creator of H.E.A.R.T Athletics LLC.  I am a Military Veteran who was fortunate enough to complete two degrees while serving on Active Duty.  A B.A. in Business Administration and an M.B.A. in Finance.  I have played sports all of my life and now coach High School football.  The acronym for my company breaks down the fundamental apsects of playing sports (which also translate into real life): H(ave) E(enough) A(ttitude) R(esilience) &amp; T(oughness).  I believe these three core elements determine who we face adversity.</li>
<li>My campaign is designed to fund my project which I have been working on for several years.  It is the H.E.A.R.T Helmet Hoody.  The hoody is a sublimated sweatshirt with a unique design.  The sweatshirt has a specific team's jersey, name, number and helmet sublimated onto it.  The zipper, when pulled all the way up, stops at the nose.  This gives the appearance of wearing not only the football team jersey, but the helmet as well.  This project is important to me because I wanted to create something that the everyday sports fan can wear, that is cool, unique and affordable.  While I can make these products for Pop Warner and High School football teams, I need this funding to pay for an NCAA and NFL license.  </li>
<li>I truly believe that this product is ground breaking and unconventional.  This funding will allow me to not only create something different, but to give back as well.  By giving back, I mean that H.E.A.R.T Athletics LLC will continue to donate 10% of all purchased items for Non-Professional teams (Little League, Pop Warner, High School sports).  This idea is my baby and all I want to do is get it off the ground.  Any donation you seem fit to provide will be greatly appreciated.</li>

</ul><p></p><p>THANK YOU for you support!!!!!</p></div>","Short Summary
My name is John Harris and I am the creator of H.E.A.R.T Athletics LLC.  I am a Military Veteran who was fortunate enough to complete two degrees while serving on Active Duty.  A B.A. in Business Administration and an M.B.A. in Finance.  I have played sports all of my life and now coach High School football.  The acronym for my company breaks down the fundamental apsects of playing sports (which also translate into real life): H(ave) E(enough) A(ttitude) R(esilience) & T(oughness).  I believe these three core elements determine who we face adversity.
My campaign is designed to fund my project which I have been working on for several years.  It is the H.E.A.R.T Helmet Hoody.  The hoody is a sublimated sweatshirt with a unique design.  The sweatshirt has a specific team's jersey, name, number and helmet sublimated onto it.  The zipper, when pulled all the way up, stops at the nose.  This gives the appearance of wearing not only the football team jersey, but the helmet as well.  This project is important to me because I wanted to create something that the everyday sports fan can wear, that is cool, unique and affordable.  While I can make these products for Pop Warner and High School football teams, I need this funding to pay for an NCAA and NFL license.  
I truly believe that this product is ground breaking and unconventional.  This funding will allow me to not only create something different, but to give back as well.  By giving back, I mean that H.E.A.R.T Athletics LLC will continue to donate 10% of all purchased items for Non-Professional teams (Little League, Pop Warner, High School sports).  This idea is my baby and all I want to do is get it off the ground.  Any donation you seem fit to provide will be greatly appreciated.
What We Need & What You Get
All of the funding will be deposited into the H.E.A.R.T Athletics LLC PayPal account.  The funds will be used for licensing and registration for the NCAA and NFL.  They will also be used for the day to day operation of H.E.A.R.T Athletics LLC.  This will include rental space, website maintenance, permits and legal paperwork.  Our goal of 4,500.00 is actually only 30% of our intended goal of 15,000.00.  
Our biggest perk comes in two different forms.  This first awesome perk is that a donation of 100.00 will allow the donator to purchase goods from H.E.A.R.T Athletics LLC (any product, any quantity) at a 10% discount for an entire calendar year.  The second perk is that we donate 10% of every item purchased back to every amateur teams who purchase our products.  It is just like fundraising but without all of the hassle.
If for some reason we don not meet our goal for fundraising, we will attempt to use the funds we have received to accomplish our goals.  It will not be easy without the funding, but hey, we Have Enough Attitude Resilience & Toughness to make it happen!
The Impact
I believe that this product will 1.) Create a sense of self-pride in the ametuer athlete who wears this product. 2.)  Generate a secondary source of income for amateur sports teams. 3.)   Completely change the way people look at fan gear.
Our track record spans over a year.  We started out with our H.E.A.R.T Athletics Player Card and Player Outline shirts, which have sold consistently.  You can see all of our products at www.hearthelmethoody.com

This company is about the customer.  Everything we create is for the benefit of the athlete and his or her institution.  It is about how much H.E.A.R.T do you have?  Because what is good enough for you, may not be good enough for the next person.  If you have any questions that i have not answered, please feel free to email me at iplaywithheart@gmail.com or if possible, you can call me (410) 937-2371.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can not donate funds, that is OK.  But I please ask you to help spread the word about this campaing and the H.E.A.R.T Helmet Hoody.  Any little bit of help helps.  And I will be eternally grateful for any help you can provide!

<h2><strong>Where we’re at….</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve worked tirelessly for months, refining the design and materials to finally achieve a product that we’re proud to put on our wrists. We have worked alongside a reputable manufacturer and now have 100% fully working prototypes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why and How the funds will be used…</strong></h2>
<p>We have funded the project ourselves to date but need your help to take it to the next level.  With your support we can have the production tools completed within two months of campaign completion and the first production run a month later. </p>
<p>We need your support to purchase tooling for the straps, case back, and module case as well as films for packaging/manual and of course purchase of the first production run of 2000pcs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Lead-time...</h2>
<p>As soon as our target is reached we will order production molds and long lead-time components such as our custom MCU’s.  The total lead-time for production including molds, procurement and assembly is approximately 3 months. </p>
<p>We hope to meet our goal as early as possible as we’d like to get these watches to you guys by Christmas! However, it is a busy time for the mail service – so if we reach our target at the very end of the campaign, then we may not make it before the 25<sup>th</sup> but will certainly try our best to do so.</p>
<p>With that being said the sooner we can get funded the better!</p>

<h3>Who is this girl??</h3>
<p>My name is Liesl Geneva and I make clothing... magical clothing.  Everything I make adjusts to fit a range of sizes and shapes from a zero (aka teensy tiny creature) to a voluptuous 18/20.  Not only does it alter itself to fit your size, but it adjusts to honor your shape.  Whether you are big and busty with an itsy bitsy waist or small and square shouldered, high waisted or low, big hipped or have a concave booty you will find something that makes you feel as fabulous as you are.</p>

<p>The past couple of months have been kind of rough on me.  I made a major investment into my retail space and things haven't gone as smoothly as I'd hoped.  Sales are down and I'm struggling to make ends meet, much less make more magical things.  What I need from you is just a little kick in the rear to get things going again.</p>
<p><strong>Here is where the money will go:</strong></p>
<p>If I raise...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$100</strong> - I get to pay my videographer, Chris Penney, for all of his hard work<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$300</strong> - I can pay my credit card bill!!! (woooooooo)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$500</strong> - I get to make some needed updates to the website like adding sections for new designs as well as some general tweaking to the site.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$800</strong> - Do some more work with Chris; we have some really cool ideas for promo videos<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,500</strong> - I get to attend this year's Michigan Womyn's Music Festival, providing they have space left. My ticket price (~$800) covers my mini-boutique inside of the Craft Bazaar as well as food and lodging for the week.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$2,500</strong> - Not only can I pay Chris, update the website and attend Fest, but I'll also get to bring a helper with me and afford enough fabric to have stuff to sell!!! (that's usually a good idea, right??) ;)</li>

<h3>What this means for me...</h3>
<p>Every person who donates/shares/likes/posts/tweets this campaign gets my undying love and affection. I've taken a blow not only financially but emotionally as well.  It's been kind of hard to keep the dream alive lately, but I'm not ready to give up quite yet... What can I say? I'm kind of stubborn like that.</p>
<p>In a culture like ours that determines a woman's worth by the size of her waist, it can be difficult to love yourself and your body.  That's why I do what I do - I help women love who they are, the size that they are, in the shape that they are in.  Whether that be hourglass or pear, we all deserve to feel beautiful.</p>

I started this campaign when I found out that I might not be able to pay off my training fees and become a fully certified teacher. Since this is my second major career (and one I plan on continuing through retirement) this was a freak out moment for me. My options (as I believed at the time) were very few. 1. I could find some very generous person to lend me almost $4000 before May 30th. 2. I could pay an extra $2000 to continue in the program through next school year. 3. I could return to music therapy. </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">#1 Just wasn't going to happen.<br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">#2 Sounded like I'd be digging a bigger hole I couldn't get out of. <br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">#3 Made me want to cry.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So Indiegogo to the rescue! If only I could get people to take a look at my page. Or maybe they are looking and just aren't interested in helping or none of my perks interest them. Or maybe (and this is my choice for the real reason) people don't like it when you beg for money. Ok, I understand that. </span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I knew I couldn't rely on this so I kept looking for other options. Turns out, my school didn't have enough teachers to teach summer school but that's after (what I thought was) the deadline.

I started this campaign when I found out that I might not be able to pay off my training fees and become a fully certified teacher. Since this is my second major career (and one I plan on continuing through retirement) this was a freak out moment for me. My options (as I believed at the time) were very few. 1. I could find some very generous person to lend me almost $4000 before May 30th. 2. I could pay an extra $2000 to continue in the program through next school year. 3. I could return to music therapy. #1 Just wasn't going to happen.#2 Sounded like I'd be digging a bigger hole I couldn't get out of. #3 Made me want to cry.So Indiegogo to the rescue! If only I could get people to take a look at my page. Or maybe they are looking and just aren't interested in helping or none of my perks interest them. Or maybe (and this is my choice for the real reason) people don't like it when you beg for money. Ok, I understand that. I knew I couldn't rely on this so I kept looking for other options. Turns out, my school didn't have enough teachers to teach summer school but that's after (what I thought was) the deadline. Not going to be soon enough but at least I could get a jump on that extra $2000 if I needed it. Then I put my piano on Craigslist. The idea of selling my piano twisted my gut in ways you can't imagine but I figured sometime down the road (in many, many years probably) I could always buy another. I have two people coming to look at it on Sunday. And then I got a phone call I'd been hoping for: An offer to do work from home in my free time on medical transcriptions.

<p>Inspired by old world belly wrapping tradition (an Ayurvedic postpartum ritual used to create lower chakra balance, assist in reducing swelling while slimming the belly), InvisiBelly are hands down the best leggings that provide shaping at the belly…and one inch up.</p>
<p>Most leggings stop at the bellybutton creating muffin top. <i><strong>InvisiBelly takes the waist up one more inch so that your entire torso - starting at the lower belly - is smooth, toned and held in without skin bunching or spilling over</strong></i>. You’ll get an immediate boost in confidence so you can go to the gym, and run around town in comfort without being self conscious or hiding behind oversized clothes. Im agine looking and feeling your absolute best wearing InvisiBelly leggings whether you’re doing lunches or crunches.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve addressed one of the biggest problems with most leggings, a waistline that slips</strong>. A silicone gel waistband prevents you from having to hitch up your leggings every time you move.

<p>You’ll find that the leggings feel better the more you wear them because they mould to your body. When ordering, choose your true size. If you expect your weight to drop, order one size down. If you’re in between sizes, I recommend you size down. If you are not sure to go a size up or down, I would recommend a size down as the fabric stretches and you will get the full effect of the shapewear compression around your stomach and abdomen area.</p>

<p>I'm a busy entrepreneur, wife and mother.</p>
<p>When I had my first child I struggled to lose the baby weight. Healing from my pregnancy was a slow two-year process and throughout, my mum coaxed me to consider the age-old Asian belly wrapping ritual she learned from her mother-in-law, my grandma Leela. I balked! After losing most of my baby weight, the hard way, I became pregnant with my second child. This time, I vowed to take better care of myself and recover more quickly. I remembered what mum said about belly wrapping and began my research.</p>
<p>My aha moment came when I thought, why not merge belly wrapping with the compression technology in athletic wear to create a legging for EVERYDAY USE? I tested what I could find on the market and while the compression mimicked Asian belly wrapping, I knew I could design a better product. And so I created my wish list:</p>

</div></div>","The most comfortable, versatile, high waisted compression leggings with built-in shape wear that are work appropriate. 
InvisiBelly combines the most advanced performance technology with old world belly reducing tradition to give you a fit that feels and looks good at the gym or at the office.  
 

 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 



Inspired by old world belly wrapping tradition (an Ayurvedic postpartum ritual used to create lower chakra balance, assist in reducing swelling while slimming the belly), InvisiBelly are hands down the best leggings that provide shaping at the belly…and one inch up.
Most leggings stop at the bellybutton creating muffin top. InvisiBelly takes the waist up one more inch so that your entire torso - starting at the lower belly - is smooth, toned and held in without skin bunching or spilling over. You’ll get an immediate boost in confidence so you can go to the gym, and run around town in comfort without being self conscious or hiding behind oversized clothes. Im agine looking and feeling your absolute best wearing InvisiBelly leggings whether you’re doing lunches or crunches.

 

 
I’ve addressed one of the biggest problems with most leggings, a waistline that slips. A silicone gel waistband prevents you from having to hitch up your leggings every time you move. It’s comfortable so you won’t experience digging, cutting or rolling at your waistline. Finally, you can be confident your leggings are staying put!
 


 
 
Ever wanted to slip on a new pair of leggings without having to wear a long top or sweater because the rear is too sheer? Me too! That’s why I sourced substantial, durable,100% opaque yarns so that your day-of-the-week panties don’t peek through and you won’t have to cover your bum, unless you want to.
 


 
Made of 90% polyamide and 10% elastane InvisiBelly leggings are durable and give you a medium compression fit for a toned look that eliminates muffin top. 360-degree compression support also means they reduce soreness and improve circulation - cutting down muscle fatigue - while fully supporting your belly area. And yes, they’re safe and comfortable to wear postpartum
 

 

Trends come and go but your InvisiBelly leggings will become a wardrobe staple. Whether you’re a 9-5 professional, a new mum, or grandmother you can dress your leggings up or down. They’ll work with your active lifestyle 365 days of the year, from season to season.
 


 
 
 
 


Built in anti-microbial technology helps fight odor causing bacteria so your leggings stay fresh and clean longer.
 


You’ll feel dry and comfortable all day with moisture wicking, a defense mechanism that draws moisture away from your body.
 




 


 

 

Effortlessly transition between work, indoor or outdoor play like crawling on the floor with your toddler, yoga, cycling, or enjoying a night out with friends. InvisiBelly are your must pack, must wear, must have leggings that adapt to the demands of your busiest days at home or on the go.

Wearabu makes babywearing as intuitive as putting on a backpack.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525895775/mbn1jqugepc1tknkdnyy.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The top safety considerations for all baby carriers are providing a clear path to breathe and preventing falls.  In addition, it is important to properly support your baby's hips.  Wearabu's romper approach fundamentally addresses all three.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525290149/jiknkimlaitmbzuczhgt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>1. Maintains a clear path to breathe:</strong> A primary concern for traditional carriers and slings is whether the baby will slide down into the pouch and have their face covered by the pouch, preventing a clear pathway to breathe.  Wearabu's design has eliminated the pouch and replaced it with a romper that fits baby's body.  It isn't possible for your baby to slide down too far into the romper and block their breathing.  This ensures that your baby's pathway to breathe is never blocked by the carrier.</p><p><strong>2. Prevents falls:</strong> Baby carriers are tested to see whether the pouch holes are too big.  The point of the test is to make sure that a baby can't slip through an opening and fall.  Again, the romper approach eliminates ""pouch holes"" all together in favor of a clothing design with no way to slip through the pant legs.  In addition, Wearabu allows you to <strong>secure your baby</strong> in the carrier <strong>prior to wearing them</strong> as opposed to traditional carriers that don't allow you to secure your baby ahead of putting them on.  This lets you make sure they are snug and secure with both hands prior to lifting them up to carry them. </p><p><strong>3. Supports baby's hips</strong>: It's important to make sure that your carrier supports your baby's hips and doesn't allow them to dangle straight down.  Wearabu's integrated “hip straps” move your baby’s legs into the <strong>proper hip positioning</strong> while being worn and release to allow free range of motion while playing in the romper.  How does this work?  The adult straps are internally connected to a support structure that pulls into proper positioning whenever you hold your baby.  When you're not holding your baby, there is extra slack in the stowed straps that allow the legs to have free range of motion.  It's really cool and something that just works without you having to think about it.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The bottom line is that <strong>Wearabu was designed from the ground up for safety</strong>.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525292192/lme5wpibiuwzhmwxc1ph.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525292202/uqb8zmze9z8tfsfx0a6l.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525900454/fytxpammkdfjkaimz2hp.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525901154/tg6duerrjnzhtn8bjzun.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525367508/mjsv2a0azylbwam4r3rd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">It’s <strong>flexible, breathable, and lightweight</strong>.  In fact, it is less than half the weight of a traditional soft-structured carrier.  We worked hard to make this something your baby can <strong>comfortably wear throughout the day</strong>, even while playing.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525289755/vtrkwl8costuq1pnowu8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">There’s <strong>no extra gear to keep up with</strong> when not in use and <strong>no bulky straps</strong>.  We leveraged principles from the latest in outdoor gear to create a contoured strap that <strong>provides comfort without bulk</strong>.  This also allows parents to easily <strong>wear another pack, purse, or jacket while wearing their baby</strong>.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525367534/iakmtjmkxwa6hqag5ymm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>What’s the big deal about babywearing you ask?

Simply unzip the stowed straps, pick your baby up, and put them on at any time.  It’s that easy. Wearabu makes babywearing as intuitive as putting on a backpack.The top safety considerations for all baby carriers are providing a clear path to breathe and preventing falls.  In addition, it is important to properly support your baby's hips.  Wearabu's romper approach fundamentally addresses all three.1. Maintains a clear path to breathe: A primary concern for traditional carriers and slings is whether the baby will slide down into the pouch and have their face covered by the pouch, preventing a clear pathway to breathe.  Wearabu's design has eliminated the pouch and replaced it with a romper that fits baby's body.  It isn't possible for your baby to slide down too far into the romper and block their breathing.  This ensures that your baby's pathway to breathe is never blocked by the carrier.2. Prevents falls: Baby carriers are tested to see whether the pouch holes are too big.  The point of the test is to make sure that a baby can't slip through an opening and fall.  Again, the romper approach eliminates ""pouch holes"" all together in favor of a clothing design with no way to slip through the pant legs.  In addition, Wearabu allows you to secure your baby in the carrier prior to wearing them as opposed to traditional carriers that don't allow you to secure your baby ahead of putting them on.  This lets you make sure they are snug and secure with both hands prior to lifting them up to carry them. 3. Supports baby's hips: It's important to make sure that your carrier supports your baby's hips and doesn't allow them to dangle straight down.  Wearabu's integrated “hip straps” move your baby’s legs into the proper hip positioning while being worn and release to allow free range of motion while playing in the romper.  How does this work?  The adult straps are internally connected to a support structure that pulls into proper positioning whenever you hold your baby.  When you're not holding your baby, there is extra slack in the stowed straps that allow the legs to have free range of motion.  It's really cool and something that just works without you having to think about it.The bottom line is that Wearabu was designed from the ground up for safety.It’s flexible, breathable, and lightweight.  In fact, it is less than half the weight of a traditional soft-structured carrier.  We worked hard to make this something your baby can comfortably wear throughout the day, even while playing.There’s no extra gear to keep up with when not in use and no bulky straps.  We leveraged principles from the latest in outdoor gear to create a contoured strap that provides comfort without bulk.  This also allows parents to easily wear another pack, purse, or jacket while wearing their baby.What’s the big deal about babywearing you ask? Well everyone knows babies want to be held all the time and there’s good reason for it. Physical touch is critical to their development, they feel most safe and secure right next mom or dad and it even jump starts their learning as they experience their parent interact with the world. With Wearabu we’ve simplified babywearing so more parents and babies can experience all this goodness.By backing our campaign you will be the first to own and/or give a Wearabu Babywearing Romper.  Wearabu is intended to be used as soon as babies outgrow our babywearing shirts, between 4-6 months old for most babies.  If your baby is not yet born, you also have the opportunity to bundle one of our existing products with a Wearabu at a large discount from our normal prices. We need to raise $25,000.  All of this money will go towards the down payment of the first order of Babywearing Rompers.  This will enable us to produce Wearabu in one color and will subsidize the total cost of production to a level that we can cover the rest with our current operating budget.  
Your Support Really Makes a DifferenceOur founders, Brian and Keri, began working on Lalabu in 2011.  Once per week Brian would go to a coffee shop to work on our first product.  Soon he was waking up early to get 2 hours of Lalabu work done before going to his full-time job.  Keri’s mom sewed the prototypes and they tested the original babywearing shirts on their first child.  Vacations were used to travel to tradeshows and find a production partner. Crowdfunding was new back then and a founder of another campaign Brian had backed online helped us find a US production partner.In January of 2013 Brian and Keri quit their jobs to launch Lalabu.  They began the business out of a 5x5 ft spare bedroom nook on a $200 Chromebook.  That May five years ago, crowdfunders just like yourselves, helped us to raise $18,000 and fund the downpayment of the first production order of the Soothe Shirt.  To give the business a greater chance of success, Brian and Keri sold their house and moved into a 1-bedroom apartment with their son. They went down to one car, started biking around the city, lived on very little, and worked without pay for the next 2 years.  Steadily our business has grown.At Lalabu, we account not just for sales dollars, but also for our positive impact on lives throughout the world.  So since the beginning we’ve given 2% of all revenue to help families, even when our business wasn’t profitable and there was no money for salaries.  Thanks to crowdfunders like you, over 40,000 people have started their lives in one of our products now and we’ve been able to loan over $100,000 to mom entrepreneurs in Africa.  Through your support, you’ve also provided adoption assistance, conception assistance, and supported other start-ups doing good.We’re now a small team of 4 full-time employees and 6 part-time employees that do everything from marketing to fulfillment out of our 2,000 sq ft office in Atlanta.  We view ourselves as a little business with a big vision to change the world, one baby at a time. We aim to impact 100,000 families over the next 3 years. As we’ve grown we’ve reinvested our revenues back into making new innovative products.  We are still a company that is bootstrapped by our founders and genuinely need you to support our campaign so we can bring new products like Wearabu to market.Wearabu would make a perfect gift for any expecting parent.  If you’re not able to contribute funds, here are a few incredibly helpful things you can do right now for free:Spread the WordPlease help more people learn about our campaign.

My industrial design and construction hobby started when I was very small and still playing with Legos. Even then, I had a desire to make cool, sophisticated, and unique products.

<h2>Why We Need Your Help</h2>
<p>Over years and years of many successes and failures, I've come to realize that the tools I have can only do so much when it comes to stainless steel. You see, the thicker a metal is, the more powerful cutting device you need in order to get the shapes and pieces you want. This is especially important when making larger, thicker pieces like medicine cabinets, cupboards, and fireplaces. Wherever I could, I would use reclaimed and recycled stainless steel. But there is only so much you can do without actually going out and cutting large pieces on your own. That is why we are asking for your support and help in raising the funds to get a commercially available, industrial shear.</p>
<p>We already have one reserved and all we need now is to meet fundraising goals in order to purchase the shear. We have chosen a robust, simple, yet affective shear that is a real work horse, and it is completely adequate for our needs for the foreseable future.</p>
<h2>What Happens If We Surpass Our Goal?</h2>
<p>We would love as much support as possible, and there would be no limit to how many pieces of furnishings and fixtures we could produce with a new metal shear.</p>
<p>We will send a reward for every pledge that we receive, outlined in the right side of this page. If we receive more than $6,750, we will use the excess money to purchase our shear and keep making unique and custom products. So please be generous and give what you can; check out the video above for more details, and the rewards to the right and below to see what you'll receive for helping us out!</p>

Rooted in genuine relationship, the concept emerged when Alexis, a Nashville native, began befriending people experiencing homelessness while on a medical leave of absence from Vanderbilt. Inspired, Alexis met regularly with Corbin, a friend from Vandy, to explore the idea of a company that would both create wages and address barriers. </p><p>A few months later, one of Alexis’ dear friends, Ray, called to ask Alexis to meet him at the hospital. Ray had been homeless most of his life and was now in his mid-sixties; he and Alexis had met years prior while she was volunteering at a local transitional home. In a conversation that would become one of their last, Ray announced to Alexis that he had a duffle bag of money that he wanted her to have after he passed. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568644717/juuty4nxwc7gezlydkuy.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Corbin and Alexis decided to name the company “Unlocked” to symbolize unlocking wages and opportunities for future employees and, of course, unlocking the storage unit. The pair went full-time with Unlocked upon graduation in 2018.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568652614/lowkasyb4btw5oi65bqh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In the past year, Unlocked has grown considerably. With humble beginnings, we began working on park benches before later upgrading to a storage closet at a partnering nonprofit, Community Care Fellowship. Most recently, we began leasing our own workshop and office near East Nashville. In that time, we’ve worked with five women, sold thousands of pieces of jewelry, and formed partnerships with incredible nonprofits. We can’t say enough about how grateful we are for the ways that the community has wrapped its arms around us, providing encouragement, support, and guidance. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568645516/rgvflfmbpu3dr0s94yzj.png"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2>Founders</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568652675/tx7xf4fgkaumrlfnykkj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Corbin Hooker </strong></p><p>Corbin is the Co-Founder and Co-President of a Unlocked. He graduated Vanderbilt University in 2018 with a triple major in political science, economics, and history with a minor in corporate strategy. He is committed to the service of others and is focused on leading projects that move us towards a more just society and a more equitable world.

Prior to studying at Vanderbilt, Alexis spent a year working at five different non-profit internships in five different countries, learning more about poverty through the eyes of those experiencing it.

Working with nonprofits, we provide services that help Makers build a stable foundation for their lives, with employment at Unlocked as the center of their transition. </p><p>We recruit Makers through one of our nonprofit partners, Community Care Fellowship (CCF). After officially hiring a woman to work at Unlocked, we work with CCF and other nonprofit partners to help her move into a private transitional housing unit before she begins working at Unlocked, affording her both stability and privacy. Makers can live in their transitional unit until they have moved into their own permanent residence, which they identify with the help of their housing case managers, or they can choose to stay long-term in their transitional unit by transferring the lease into their own name. During their time at Unlocked, Makers contribute to rent in proportion to the wages they earn crafting jewelry, allowing them to scale their responsibility monthly as they stabilize and take on more hours at Unlocked.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/360328177?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><p>Unlocked also has partnerships with mental health counselors and career counselors who have agreed to meet weekly with Makers at our office at no cost to the women, allowing Makers to receive personalized care without transportation or budgeting difficulties. We also provide weekly financial training courses at the office, combining group activities with personal goals and cash prizes incentives each month.</p><p>Integrating all the Unlocked’s components, from housing to employment to counseling, our social programming is divided into six “phases” with tangible goals for each, some predetermined and some personal. After completing the goals of each of the six phases, which should each last one month, a Maker will either “graduate” to the next phase or be asked to repeat the phase if she has not completed the goals she set for herself (examples of goals include things like timeliness, savings, and meetings with counselors). In this way, our programming is measurable for both Unlocked Makers and staff, and it is flexible based on the priorities of each Maker and the rate of their personal progression through the programming. For those that “repeat” a phase, they will simply stay with Unlocked programming and employment longer than the 6-month timeline.</p><h3> </h3><h3><b>Community Partners</b></h3><p>Our community partners are essential for the holistic support our Makers need. They are the reason we were able to begin building a comprehensive social program so quickly, and they are the key to our success in empowering our Makers beyond employment. We are incredibly grateful for their continued support of this company and mission.</p><p><strong>Community Care Fellowship</strong></p><p>The CCF serves as a daytime shelter that provides hot meals, warm showers, laundry/hygiene facilities, counseling, and social services referrals for people experiencing homelessness. Beyond providing these core services, they have programs such as career counseling and pre-K education to help break down the cycles of poverty.</p><p>Unlocked and CCF have worked together to develop a system that provides Unlocked Makers with access to career counselors, housing specialists, and a transitional housing unit for the duration of their employment at Unlocked.</p><p><strong>Urban Housing Solutions (by extension)</strong></p><p>Through a “master lease” partnership, Urban Housing Solutions leases affordable housing units to CCF, which they can then sublease or sign over permanently to Unlocked Makers or other participants in their career counseling program.</p><p><strong>Laura Edwards, Career Counselor </strong></p><p>Laura Edwards is the volunteer career counselor for Community Care Fellowship’s career counseling program. She serves as our “recruiter” by recommending best-fit candidates to apply and interview with Unlocked, and she offers continued career counseling sessions to Unlocked Makers.  Unlocked currently hires exclusively through CCF’s career counseling program to streamline the recruitment process.</p><p><strong>Dr. Rena Hall, Career Counselor</strong></p><p>The CEO of Together We Can consultants, Dr. Hall has an impressive background in nonprofits and executive management, fortified by her 27 years of experience in the education sector. She began working with Unlocked as a career counselor to meet weekly with Makers and develop our 6-month curriculum, based on self-image, personal relationships, self-advocacy, and skills like interviewing and resume building. Her talents are of tremendous benefit to Unlocked Makers as they build confidence and professional direction.</p><p><strong>Community Financial Resources</strong></p><p>Community Financial Resources is a financial services nonprofit that focuses on empowering low-income individuals. To ensure the best fit for our Makers, CFR did a “deep dive” on Unlocked and created a personalized 8-week curriculum of financial training that includes savings, budgeting, and goal-setting. We host the sessions weekly, fostering a sense of support and community in the group-based activities and lessons.</p><p>Through a partnership with US Bank, Community Financial Resources also offers Unlocked Makers direct deposit payroll cards called Focus Cards, allowing Makers to receive their wages without going to a bank or paying a cashing fee. With their Focus Cards, each Maker also has a separate personal savings account and can set up automatic savings. Unlocked Makers also use CFR's $goals$ app, which incentivizes productive habits by allowing Makers to “log” their financial actions, and the Maker with the most approved actions at the end of the month wins a cash bonus.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568129593/okhwid8d5viruapcmuwv.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><h2><strong>Funding Goal</strong></h2><p>This transition to the next iteration of Unlocked is absolutely critical to our ability to employ and empower more women.

We are committed to expanding our impact by employing and empowering 20 women in 2020 in a way that is thoughtful and sustainable. To do this, we've completely reimagined the jewelry we make and the way we make it, to bring you impactful fine jewelry that's accessibly priced and responsibly crafted.But to make this possible, we need your help to pre-order our new jewelry or donate to our campaign so that we can buy new equipment, complete our new jewelry line, begin hiring more Makers. With your help, we will continue our rapid growth and create truly transformative employment opportunities that connect and empower both our Makers and our customers.

We are committed to monitoring, tracking, and improving our performance on metrics like water, energy, and chemical usage. We will publish our first impact report at the end of our Indiegogo fulfillment to set a baseline of performance from which we can improve. This has always been what makes our jewelry so special for us and our customers. Through our packaging, social media, and Maker bios online, we've worked hard to show customers how every piece of Unlocked jewelry creates deeply personal impact.Engraved InitialsStarting with our new line of jewelry, we will be even more intentional about connecting customers to the story behind each piece. Each piece will be engraved with the initials of the woman who made it, so you can be reminded of your positive impact on someone’s life each time you put it on.Behind the ScenesStarting with our Indiegogo campaign, we will also be launching a Behind the Scenes blog, exclusively for our customers. The blog will feature messages from our Makers and staff, exclusive insight into our programming, from financial literacy courses to crafting jewelry, and sneak peaks of upcoming developments at Unlocked. Through this Behind the Scenes blog, we hope to give you a more personal look at the difference you’re making in the lives of our Makers.  MissionWe employ women to craft gorgeous jewelry at our studio, providing a stable wage, supportive community, and job training experience. While employment is a crucial component to self-sufficiency, our Makers face many complex barriers, and a job alone is not enough. That's why we've been building a holistic social program that includes housing and services alongside our jewelry business, providing the support our Makers need to transition sustainably.Alongside our work with our Makers, we strive to empower our customers through the impact they can create. Sharing our Makers’ messages of hope and strength, we seek to break down the stigma of homelessness and create a more equitable world. Using our influence to be kinder to the planet, we will continue to improve our sustainability measures through our recycled materials and water and electricity usage. StoryUnlocked’s founding story is unique, if not downright miraculous. Rooted in genuine relationship, the concept emerged when Alexis, a Nashville native, began befriending people experiencing homelessness while on a medical leave of absence from Vanderbilt. Inspired, Alexis met regularly with Corbin, a friend from Vandy, to explore the idea of a company that would both create wages and address barriers. A few months later, one of Alexis’ dear friends, Ray, called to ask Alexis to meet him at the hospital. Ray had been homeless most of his life and was now in his mid-sixties; he and Alexis had met years prior while she was volunteering at a local transitional home. In a conversation that would become one of their last, Ray announced to Alexis that he had a duffle bag of money that he wanted her to have after he passed. Corbin and Alexis decided to name the company “Unlocked” to symbolize unlocking wages and opportunities for future employees and, of course, unlocking the storage unit. The pair went full-time with Unlocked upon graduation in 2018.  In the past year, Unlocked has grown considerably. With humble beginnings, we began working on park benches before later upgrading to a storage closet at a partnering nonprofit, Community Care Fellowship. Most recently, we began leasing our own workshop and office near East Nashville. In that time, we’ve worked with five women, sold thousands of pieces of jewelry, and formed partnerships with incredible nonprofits. We can’t say enough about how grateful we are for the ways that the community has wrapped its arms around us, providing encouragement, support, and guidance.   FoundersCorbin Hooker Corbin is the Co-Founder and Co-President of a Unlocked. He graduated Vanderbilt University in 2018 with a triple major in political science, economics, and history with a minor in corporate strategy. He is committed to the service of others and is focused on leading projects that move us towards a more just society and a more equitable world. In addition to building social enterprises, Corbin plans to eventually expand his capacity to create institutional change through public office.Alexis CookAlexis is a passionate individual with a drive to create a more equitable world through increased opportunity and empowerment. The Co-Founder and Co-President of Unlocked, Alexis was an Ingram Scholar at Vanderbilt University, where she graduated in 2018 with a bachelor’s in Human and Organizational Development and a minor in Economics. Prior to studying at Vanderbilt, Alexis spent a year working at five different non-profit internships in five different countries, learning more about poverty through the eyes of those experiencing it. Alexis is focused on using her leadership to elevate the voices of marginalized people, creating pathways for sustainable change. VisionBeginning with the women that we hire to fulfill your Indiegogo pre-orders, our Makers will go through a 6-month transitional program that combines employment and holistic resources in a cohesive and streamlined experience. Working with nonprofits, we provide services that help Makers build a stable foundation for their lives, with employment at Unlocked as the center of their transition. We recruit Makers through one of our nonprofit partners, Community Care Fellowship (CCF). After officially hiring a woman to work at Unlocked, we work with CCF and other nonprofit partners to help her move into a private transitional housing unit before she begins working at Unlocked, affording her both stability and privacy. Makers can live in their transitional unit until they have moved into their own permanent residence, which they identify with the help of their housing case managers, or they can choose to stay long-term in their transitional unit by transferring the lease into their own name. During their time at Unlocked, Makers contribute to rent in proportion to the wages they earn crafting jewelry, allowing them to scale their responsibility monthly as they stabilize and take on more hours at Unlocked.Unlocked also has partnerships with mental health counselors and career counselors who have agreed to meet weekly with Makers at our office at no cost to the women, allowing Makers to receive personalized care without transportation or budgeting difficulties. We also provide weekly financial training courses at the office, combining group activities with personal goals and cash prizes incentives each month.Integrating all the Unlocked’s components, from housing to employment to counseling, our social programming is divided into six “phases” with tangible goals for each, some predetermined and some personal. After completing the goals of each of the six phases, which should each last one month, a Maker will either “graduate” to the next phase or be asked to repeat the phase if she has not completed the goals she set for herself (examples of goals include things like timeliness, savings, and meetings with counselors). In this way, our programming is measurable for both Unlocked Makers and staff, and it is flexible based on the priorities of each Maker and the rate of their personal progression through the programming. For those that “repeat” a phase, they will simply stay with Unlocked programming and employment longer than the 6-month timeline. Community PartnersOur community partners are essential for the holistic support our Makers need. They are the reason we were able to begin building a comprehensive social program so quickly, and they are the key to our success in empowering our Makers beyond employment. We are incredibly grateful for their continued support of this company and mission.Community Care FellowshipThe CCF serves as a daytime shelter that provides hot meals, warm showers, laundry/hygiene facilities, counseling, and social services referrals for people experiencing homelessness. Beyond providing these core services, they have programs such as career counseling and pre-K education to help break down the cycles of poverty.Unlocked and CCF have worked together to develop a system that provides Unlocked Makers with access to career counselors, housing specialists, and a transitional housing unit for the duration of their employment at Unlocked.Urban Housing Solutions (by extension)Through a “master lease” partnership, Urban Housing Solutions leases affordable housing units to CCF, which they can then sublease or sign over permanently to Unlocked Makers or other participants in their career counseling program.Laura Edwards, Career Counselor Laura Edwards is the volunteer career counselor for Community Care Fellowship’s career counseling program. She serves as our “recruiter” by recommending best-fit candidates to apply and interview with Unlocked, and she offers continued career counseling sessions to Unlocked Makers.  Unlocked currently hires exclusively through CCF’s career counseling program to streamline the recruitment process.Dr. Rena Hall, Career CounselorThe CEO of Together We Can consultants, Dr. Hall has an impressive background in nonprofits and executive management, fortified by her 27 years of experience in the education sector. She began working with Unlocked as a career counselor to meet weekly with Makers and develop our 6-month curriculum, based on self-image, personal relationships, self-advocacy, and skills like interviewing and resume building. Her talents are of tremendous benefit to Unlocked Makers as they build confidence and professional direction.Community Financial ResourcesCommunity Financial Resources is a financial services nonprofit that focuses on empowering low-income individuals. To ensure the best fit for our Makers, CFR did a “deep dive” on Unlocked and created a personalized 8-week curriculum of financial training that includes savings, budgeting, and goal-setting. We host the sessions weekly, fostering a sense of support and community in the group-based activities and lessons.Through a partnership with US Bank, Community Financial Resources also offers Unlocked Makers direct deposit payroll cards called Focus Cards, allowing Makers to receive their wages without going to a bank or paying a cashing fee. With their Focus Cards, each Maker also has a separate personal savings account and can set up automatic savings. Unlocked Makers also use CFR's $goals$ app, which incentivizes productive habits by allowing Makers to “log” their financial actions, and the Maker with the most approved actions at the end of the month wins a cash bonus.  Funding GoalThis transition to the next iteration of Unlocked is absolutely critical to our ability to employ and empower more women. For months, we have been building up to this to this moment by developing the skills and buying the preliminary equipment needed to make very small batches of these products. Funding Use With the funds raised by this campaign, we will buy the equipment necessary to be able to produce this jewelry faster, more reliably, and at scale.  You can make a difference

There is absolutely nothing better than a perfectly cooked, hot off of the grill, beautiful steak, paired with the perfectly chilled beer. But let's be honest. We don't always cook steaks perfectly, and with steaks costing upwards of $40-$50 apiece at a good restaurant, it just costs too much to go out, especially if you have a family.</p>
<p>So, I started looking for ways to cook the perfect steak, to cook the perfect steak every time. I found a method called Sous Vide. Using precise temperature control, the finest restaurants cook the steak, regardless of size, to a perfect medium rare (or any other doneness you desire), and then brown up the outside and bring it to your table.</p>
<p>The only problem. Souse Vide machines cost hundreds to thousands of dollars. And, they only do one thing.</p>
<p>I knew I could do better, so I did my research. The Alton is the result. Not only does it make cooking the perfect steak easy, it also makes chilling a beer to the perfect temperature effortless.</p>
<p>The Alton gives me the ability to turn a $10 slow cooker into a Sous Vide machine worth hundreds. I can cook 1 steak or 4. What's more, I've used a 5 gallon slow cooker to cook 2lb New York Strips, 10-12 of them. That's right, 24lbs of steak all cooking at once. With the Alton, they are all done at the same time, and are perfectly cooked edge to edge, not even a hint of overdoneness. The Alton controls the temperature of any cooking to within a tenth of a degree F. I toss the steaks on the grill for 30-60 seconds to brown the outside and serve immediately, without the need to rest the meat. Quite simply they are better than any steak I've ever had at any restaurant.</p>
<p>But the Alton is all about multi-tasking. Named for our favorite chef, the Alton is an all in one temperature controller. I've used it to help perfectly melt chocolate (those of you who have done it know how hard it can be). It also works great for melting cheese.</p>
<p>What's more, you can use the Alton not only to heat, but to cool. That's right, just plug in any kitchen device that heats or cools and the Alton will precisely control the temperatures. Let's talk beer.</p>
<p>The Alton is perfect solution for precisely controlling that minifridge you've been using as kegerator. The Alton is one of the most important multi-tasking tools in my kitchen, and I'm sure it will be in yours. The money I've saved in steaks alone vs eating out has been unbelievable. The 24 lbs of NY Strips I mentioned earlier I paid $75 dollars for. The equivalent at a fine steakhouse would have been well over $500, and over $800 at some.</p>
<p>However, if we really want to talk multi-tasking, the Alton can also be used for Fondue, for water baths, for foot warmers (gross but true), for melting plastics, for mold-making, for electric smokers, and on and on. The applications are limitless.</p>
<p>Cooking should not be hard. The Alton makes it easy, and more affordable. What's more, unlike those expensive dedicated machines, it is not limited to just one function.</p>

Therefore, the vintage watch price of a well recognized brand, i.e. Rolex, Heuer, Patek Philippe, Omega, Brietling, etc, can far exceed modern new models. Do you know why?Vintage watches were made in small batches that required immense amount of highly skilled labor and craftsmanship. With a focus by mass market brands on volume and margins, the design and quality aspects are no longer top priorities for most watches. It is inevitable that many small but significant details have been neglected.Working in collaboration with appointed factories that are supplying top Swiss watch labels, we are challenging them to maintain their quality standards when creating the Urban. It is time to give the ‘big boys’ a shake up.Besides the 5 fixed designs, the 'Build Your Own' Urban Chronograph will be offered via Undone's watch customizer, where users can interact and build their own with choices of case colors, hands, dials and straps.

  FAQ Do you have an official website? Website: www.undone.watch Customizer: https://www.undone.watch/series/customizerWhat does 'Design Your Own Urban' entitles to? Can I choose the fixed design dials?You can build an Urban with any parts combination that is offered via the customizer (http://bit.ly/2kpPLHs), INCLUDING THE KILLY, SPEEDY, NAVI, AUTA AND NEWMAN from the VINTAGE COLLECTION, plus other dials from the MODERN and CLASSIC range. For example, if you want the Killy, you simply need to choose a silver case, Killy dial, blue classic hands and vintage grey  leather strap in the customizer. Why 'Build Your Own'?1. You can choose from THREE dial collections: Vintage (fixed design offerings), Classic and Modern. Fixed design only included part of the Vintage dial collection. 2. You can include personalization on both the dial and caseback3. Most importantly, you can choose your own watch straps too! Can I choose another watch strap instead of the default for my Urban Chronograph (Fixed Design)? NO, all fixed design comes as it is and you can only indicate your choice of either a SOLID or GLASS caseback with NO PERSONALIZATION.

Customization and personalization on fixed designs will not be offered. They are priced lower because they are fixed with much less operational cost incurred. However, if any backers decided to change their mind after the campaign to upgrade to the 'Build Your Own', we will definitely grant that! Do you offer warranty for the Undone Urban?We offer 12 months manufacturer's warranty from date of purchase repair or replace the watch movement if it has a manufacturing defect.

I am Agata and together with my friend Ann we are moulding flowers out of clay. Why we started to do this? The answer is simple - we love the nature and want to wear something cute but extraordinary. Because when you have the flowers circlet on your head you make perfect and natural image. This is what every women wants to be - individual, attractive, yet natural.For the successful campaing we need 1500 USD to raise. This costs will go to our internet project - development of the site, and materials.We aim to gather some handmaders into one site and create a little eco-world of interesting things.  This will make care
of nature popular.We started to think about this project as
long as we’ve watched how the humanity treats the nature; we’ve forgotten where
we live. Haydy is created not only for fashion. It is the
sign of nature and when you wear it you show that you think and care about the
environment.  
We now are proposing to you different collections. Just let us know what you like.  The prices for each accessory from our collections are equal. Fro example, the collection  ""POPPY SEED"". 
While choosing you just need to text from what collection you would like to buy the beautiful accessory.

detail is totally handmade - it takes a lot of time and inspiration to gather

IMPORTANT NOTICE to Potential ContributorsDue to the increase of BOM, we'll not be able to provide MORPHEUS delta (a Kickstarter edition) for potential contributors at this price any more. Please note that...We've featured on 3DPrint.com,  3Ders.org, Fabbaloo, 3DPI, and more. Please check the Updates for more article from various countries.We want to talk about Personal 3D Printer.According to the market research, 9 of 10 users are using an FDM (fused deposition modeling) / FFF (fused filament fabrication) type 3D printer. TEAM OWL WORKS has also been using some twenty different FDM 3D printers for our work since 2013. FDM has many benefits as a personal 3D printer such as...
well-established eco-system
good community with many users
low-priced machines
Most of all, it is CHEAP (both the machine & its operation costs) !THANKS, We can afford it !Introduction to FDM/FFF technologyHowever, it has some limitations on making things of high quality (or fine resolution) due to its physical & mechanical nature. For example, it's VERY difficult (or impossible) to print a famous Eiffel Tower miniature around 110-mm-height as designed. If you're googling, you will find many results showing how difficult it is. Even some great FDM 3D printers' results are not satisfactory at all. Another drawback is..speed. Printing speed of FDM machines are too slow. When you're trying to make a big thing or many of the same things, you will be frustrated with its printing speed.   3 Eiffel Towers printed by 3 different FDM 3D printers. Courtesy of Computer World    We don't want to blame FDM 3D printer but do want to talk about ANOTHER option for personal 3D printer, because the creative work should not be blocked by the limitation of FDM 3D printers.Need something different !  Let's consider a resin 3D printer. We have SLA (Stereo Lithography Apparatus) and DLP (Digital Light Processing) technologies. They show a fine quality (far beyond FDM), because they employ light to form things from liquid photopolymer (resin). However they also have drawbacks; small build-volume and not-so-fast. Even worse, they are too expensive for common users to afford it. We know a couple of brands can provide relatively low-priced machine, but the operation cost (including resin, VAT and other consumables) is still expensive and the printing performance is not as good as we expect from such high-priced machine3.We need something different from SLA & DLP as well as FDM; it should be far better than FDM in printing performance, and better than SLA and DLP in some aspects like price, build-volume and so on.  LIPS & MORPHEUS.  In fact, we have a solution. Look back in 2015, we introduced a new kind of resin 3D printing technology, called LIPS (Light Induced Planar Solidification). If you look at a schematic diagram how it works, you may think it's very similar to DLP (or SLA) technology. However it is different from other resin 3D printing technologies. Introduction to LIPS technology.    The most striking feature of LIPS technology is 'a planar light source & digital photo mask' (a LIPS engine, we called) which makes a digitally sliced image from the data into a physical layer of a printed object. It can expose the digital image to the photopolymer (resin) without any distortion caused by light intensity over the whole plane. Also, it is not expensive !3D Printing Technology : FDM, SLA, DLP and LIPSWith this technology, we successfully provided a large build-volume resin 3D printer to the world at an affordable price...the MORPHEUS. If you did not hear about us, please check our former Kickstarter campaign.   MORPHEUS 3D printer, Kickstarter campaign 2015.    The MORPHEUS is okay for business users but still expensive for individuals. That's the reason why we started a new project, called E7.Project E7 toward a New MORPHEUS.  When we started the Project E7 early this year, the goal of the Project was simple & clear, 'make another MORPHEUS at FDM price', and we have spent almost 5,000 hours for R&D to realize our concept. Based on LIPS technology, we adopted various open-source technologies & knowledge like Arduino, Raspberry Pi and so on, to reduce the cost and development period. So.. we could successfully demonstrated its functional prototypes in just a few short months.Project E7, evolution of prototypes.    Check the time-lapse of printing '8 rooks at once' by Mark 3 version. We demonstrated the MK2 version (2nd functional prototype) in public last September.  Public demonstration @ 3DPIA 2016 in Daejeon, South KoreaWe designed & named the final product very thoughtfully, after we confirmed all the function of E7 product. We really wanted to inspire a whole new world of 3D printing through our new product.   #
And...finally... 
we're proudly introducing...
MORPHEUS delta, a revolutionary personal resin 3D printer.
# Please check the video for the design and printed things that you'll get. It has three outstanding features;  
Excellent Performance (over price).
Affordable Price & Low Operation Cost (for individuals).
Unique Philosophy (for creative works).
# We've developed it far better than others in the market. # We know the total cost of operation is the most important thing for personal-use.   # We designed it based on the philosophy.     As a result, MORPHEUS delta will be the first product that is creating a new category; Low Cost, High Quality.  MORPHEUS delta creates a new category; Low Cost. High Quality.Please take a look at the product position of the MORPHEUS delta. It's in between FDM and SLA/DLP machines, but some key aspects are beyond the other 3D printing technologies in the market.     What you can do with the MORPHEUS delta.   # Miniature Sculptures.      # Ornaments & Parts.    # Accessories.# Things for your creative works. : A tiny tree for a diorama  # And more.  

For FDM users : It'll enable you to create more complicated things in short time.

For SLA/DLP users : It'll help you reduce costs for printing mid-high quality large objects.

For material developers : It might be the best solution for your R&D.

For 3D printing instructors : Teach using a resin 3D printer without the expensive cost issues.

MORPHEUS delta vs. Others.  We summarized key aspects for comparison purpose, and we have visualized a build-volume for each 3D printer as well.         Please check the build-area (or platform size) of the MORPHEUS delta, compared with that of other DLP 3D printers in the market now.   Printing Speed & Productivity.  When we talk about printing speeds, there are two approaches to asses.
First is the direct measurement of the growing rate when it prints an  object (or a thing) :in other workds, the printing speed.
The other is to calculate (or measure) the total time to get certain number of objects made : that is, productivity (or throughput).
We took both approaches.We've also calculated how long it would take to make one hundred 1-inch cubes using different 3D printers.  
Per FDM, we set the layer thickness, infill & nozzle speed as 0.2 mm, 25% and 80 mm/sec, respectively.
Per DLP, we set the printing speed at 6.2 sec/ 100 um (average value; we've collected the data from the market and reflects our experimental data from Kudo 3D's Titan & DIY DLP)
We ignored the processing time per batch such as detaching the printed objects & reloading, any post processing and so on.
The results show that the throughput of the MORPHEUS delta is higher than both FDM (6X) & DLP (4X).   General Information.   # Printing Software. (Complementary)

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<p><strong>How is the VERSATYL priced so low?</strong></p>
<p>We run a tight ship &amp; have an efficient structure. We have automated machines with high labour productivity. Further. crowdfunding means our INVENTORY &amp; WORKING CAPITAL requirements are almost ZERO as we get funds in advance. That translates into very low costs for us. Rather than try &amp; make big profits we would rather build a big brand. We decided we would pass on most of the benefits of this lower price to you - our Backer. We still make a decent profit at these prices! </p>
<p><strong>About us &amp; why we are doing this?</strong></p>
<p>Emirate Fashions Pvt Ltd has a long history in clothing manufacturing and has been making garments for a few of the reputed brands in India. The VERSATYL is the result of massive demand that we've seen from observing travellers, bikers, cyclists &amp; the outdoor person. Rather than come up with another Jacket, we decided to give ""people on the move"" a piece of clothing that gave them the freedom to carry all their essentials around on their person! After our two Successful campaign on fuelAdream, A premier Indian Crowd funding platform, Now We're launching this campaign on indiegogo.com to make it easier to reach out to customers globally!</p>
<p><strong>What are our labour practices?</strong></p>
<p>We pay our workers as per the Indian governments daily wage act. All the tailors &amp; artisans who work in our factory are above the age of 21. We are an equal opportunity employer.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any international custom fees?</strong></p>
<p>The cost of the Versatyl includes international shipping. However, any duty/taxes/local levies etc. if applicable are not factored for and will be the responsibility of the funder. You will need to pay this when you receive the Jacket. </p>
<p><strong>Is the Jacket waterproof?</strong></p>
<p>The jacket is water resistant &amp; not waterproof. If exposed to long durations of heavy rainfall, water might begin to seep in through the seams.</p>
<p><strong>What are the care/cleaning guidelines?</strong></p>
<p>The care and cleaning maintenance of the jacket are fairly basic. It can be washed on any machine wash setting. Since its water resistant most things will swipe right off the jacket as well! Do not IRON it though.</p>
<p><strong>What is your policy on returns?</strong></p>
<p>We do not have a return policy. Since we are crowdfunding it and doing this at a break-even price we cannot afford a return policy. Our advice on size is to ideally pick a size that is slightly bigger than what you would usually buy. That is cause when you stuff the Jacket with a number of items you will need some extra space to have a perfect fit.</p>
<p><strong>Should I order the Jacket in my size or is ""a size bigger"" the correct fit for me?</strong></p>
<p>Jackets are usually worn on one or two layers of clothing. In addition the VERSATYL can pack quite a lot of travel stuff making it bulk up a bit. The last thing you want is a super tight fit. Ordering a size bigger is what we would recommend. The final call is yours.</p>

<p>BullToro is redefining rugged fashion with bold and distinctive watches. Backed by 4 patents, the powerful look telegraphs the rugged strength of its intelligent engineering. Built of high quality, durable materials, each part is crafted to provide long product life.  We plan to offer 3-hand analog and crown operated digital watches. Priced between $295 to $395, our watches have unique “fit and comfort” features with oversized cases, tilted dials and displays, oversized angled crowns, raised ridges on casebacks, vents on cases and bracelets and electroluminescent backlights. All watches are water and shock resistant and use stainless steel cases with mineral glass lens, a fiberglass reinforced polycarbonate core and stainless steel bracelets or durable polyurethane straps. All watches have a 3-year battery life and are backed by a 2 year warranty. Our watches are geared to appeal to younger, hip urbanites and urban professionals, male and female, primarily ages 18-44 and who like to shop on the Internet.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Smart Design Solutions to Enhance Fit and Comfort on Your Wrist</h3>
<p>The BullToro Watch brand is built around the premise of large-sized innovative designs that not only standout against repetitive watch styling, but are based on smart, solution-based design and engineering to enhance consumer comfort and fit. Guided by consumer feedback, we imparted several unique consumer benefits into our designs: an enhanced grip/angled crown (utility patent) to help reset time and other functions without removing the watch from the wrist; a  tilted watch face, angled back toward the wearer to enhance readability; a series of comfort vents in the watch head and bracelets which help with air circulation and cooling between the watch and wrist; and lastly, raised bumps on the caseback (utility patent) which helps to elevate the watch and also keep the wrist cool.   </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Our company <a href=""http://tereskids.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Teres Kids</a> is a breakthrough children's clothing line focused on optimal comfort. <a href=""http://tereskids.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Teres Kids</a> clothes are great for all children. They are also a much needed solution for millions of children suffering from tactile sensitivities.  This includes children with autism, sensory processing disorder and eczema.  More children are simply uncomfortable in their clothes.  For many parents, dressing their children is the hardest part of their day. Teres Kids provides a unique solution for millions of families in America, Canada, Europe and Japan.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All <a href=""http://tereskids.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Teres Kids</a> clothes are made in America. To make our premium clothing we start with the softest organic cotton available. We then eliminate all things that make kids uncomfortable such as tags, scratchy seams and rough edges. We create a super soft internal body - the part of the clothing that touches a child's skin. We believe it's the most comfortable product on the market.<br/></p>
<br/>We are growing rapidly. We need your help!.  Our order volume is growing so quickly, we are having trouble keeping up. When we manufacture each collection we pay months in advance for the materials and labor. We need additional funding to keep up with the increased demand. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is about getting our organic, super comfortable clothes to as many kids as we can. The impact will be measured one family at a time. For example:</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $25,000 to meet the demands of our Winter 2011 collection, so we can get Teres Kids clothes to all the kids who want them.   All these funds will go to production of clothing including: fabric, dyeing, cutting, sewing and  printing. Our order volume is growing so quickly we are having trouble keeping up.  Instead of getting a bank loan we thought it would be better to engage people who believe in what we are doing and want to help! All other funding comes from Marianne and I, as well as friends and family.</p>
<p>We've put together some sweet perks for you and the children in your lives (ages 2-8). Here are photos of a few of our perks.</p>

CORTÈZ JACKET +  MID-LAYERKeeps you warm - whenever, wherever.Especially for the Indiegogo community, all backers receive a beautifully designed mid-layer jacket for free (€100 value). We care about the environment and our animal friends. That's why all Cortèz mid-layer jackets come with the revolutionary 3M™ Thinsulate™ Insulation.3M developed this innovative insulation to make living life in every season more enjoyable, while at the same time replacing natural down.The mid-layer is highly breathable and warm, perfect for layering in colder conditions or just as a standalone piece. THE CORTÈZ JACKET VS. ARC'TERYX AND NORTH FACEA picture is worth a thousand words. Let us show you why we believe the Cortèz jacket can easily compete with the best in the industry.  
EXCELLENT VALUE: SELLING STRAIGHT FROM THE MANUFACTURERBy using a disruptive direct-to-consumer model, and cutting out the middlemen, we can offer our jackets for an exceptionally reduced price while maintaining the same high-quality standards as leading industry brands.As a result, we can offer our high-performance jacket for €319 (Indiegogo price) + a mid-layer jacket for free ( + mid-layer (€100 value).         OUR DESIGN PROCESSFor the past 12+ months we've been working together with world-renowned manufacturers on multiple prototypes to finalise our very first collection. It all started with an idea. Together with our supplier Vert Company - a true pioneer in the field of sustainable production - we're now ready to start production of the Cortèz jacket and mid-layer. OUR REVOLUTIONARY FABRICDermizax®EV - The perfect membrane that redefines comfort and protection for high-performance fabrics.WHY THIS FABRIC?Dermizax®EV is a 100% waterproof, windproof and breathable membrane (fabric).

<p>Hi! I'm Elio, an illustrator based in Sarawak, Malaysia. I can usually be found online as @heliosdraws on Tumblr, Twitter and Instagram. This is my first crowdfunding campaign and my first time making enamel pins, and my goal is to design and create bespoke pins with beautiful designs for the quirky, the unique and the fashion-forward!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540717038/ul2nbfl3iicubdhzhzyf.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>INTRODUCTION:</h3>
<p>I created this campaign based on the positive feedback from friends and fans alike on both Tumblr and Twitter, and I've decided to design my pins based on the Unions present in the mobile game, Kingdom Hearts Union X, as tribute to the game and the series in general. I tried to keep the designs as general as possible, so that it attracts those who don't know the game or the series, but would like unique pins based on mythological or existing animals to add to their collection. </p>
<p>The pins available are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Unicornis/Unicorn</i></li>
<li><i>Vulpes/Fox</i></li>
<li>Ursus/Bear</li>
<li>Anguis/Cobra</li>
<li>Leopardos/Leopard</li>
</ul>
<h3>FUND BREAKDOWN:</h3>
<p>For this campaign, <u><strong>75%</strong></u> of the funds will go towards <strong>manufacturing and shipping of the pins</strong>, and <strong><u>5%</u></strong> will go towards <strong>Indiegogo fees</strong>, while the remaining <u><strong>25%</strong></u> will go towards <strong>packaging </strong>and <strong>manufacturing of other perks</strong> available in this campaign. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS:</h3>
<p>This is my first venture into making enamel pins, so possible risks include longer production time than estimated (in order to correct any errors and making changes). I have however made contact with and learned about the process of making pins from more experienced friends, so I will ensure that these errors are minimal and do not require significant changes. </p>
<p>Other risks include:</p>
<p><strong>Delays in shipping:</strong> I will be using Pos Malaysia's Flexipack International to ship all pins worldwide, including an international tracking number. While deliveries with this service is expected to arrive within two weeks, sometimes shipping delays and lost packages may occur during delivery. </p>
<p><strong>Campaign nature:</strong> Bear in mind that this is a <strong><i>fixed campaign</i></strong>. If the goal of $500 is not met within the stipulated timeline, there will be no rewards and the money will be returned to you.</p>

<p>Eda produces her line of fashion accessories between Paris, New York and San Juan (Puerto Rico) and is one out of five finalist in the category “The Aimee Kestenberg “Self Love” Inspired Handbag”.

<p><strong>“Even though I now live in Paris, Puerto Rico is still an essential part of my designs. My mom and my aunts together with other seamstress in the island make by hand important pieces of the line such as capes, gloves, hats, sashs, and lace jewelry.” </strong></p>

<p>The brand tries to complement the life of a modern woman, which is nowday’s quite active, stylish but busy. “Our accessories are sophisticated, elegant and feminine. They give the perfect last touch to any attire and promise to give new life to the classic “little black dress”, regardless if the dress was inherited from your mother or you have used it on a few occasions”.</p>

<p>Eda Lourdes'  accessories have been sold in the boutiques such as Madonna &amp; Co. in New York City and Escarcha Guaynabo, PR. Although her first collection was only accessories, Eda always dreamed of creating a line of handbags. Since her teenage years she would entertain herself decomposing jewelry from handbags and adding other elements to then create a new bag design. When she was living in New York she made over 30 bags for her girlfriends incorporating fashion trends like lace and <i>Swarovski</i> crystal. In 2017, Eda submitted her first design to the IHDA with an innovative design that had different straps, but it was not until this year when her third submission caught the attention of the judges.</p>
<p><strong>“Is this for real? This is the third time I send a handbag design”.</strong> That was Eda’s reaction to the unexpected news. It was Emily Bluenthal, the founder and creator of the IHDA who called her to inform that her design had been selected among thousands of competitors.</p>
<p>The Independent Handbag Designer Awards were created in 2007 to recognize the creativity in handbag designs in the United States and across the world. Now in its 13th edition, the awards are now a staple on the fashion industry given that is the only international design competition that discovers, recognize and create brand awareness for independent handbag designers. Annually about 2000 submissions are sent from designers from 5 continents and 28 countries compete on this prestigious event.</p>
<p>With the objective of formalizing her passion, Eda took courses of business and design from the Parsons The New School for Design” and worked for the blog Rue de Rogues. She has also worked various fashion houses in Paris like IRO, APPARIS, MIRIAM BUDET &amp; LEMLOREN.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559811396/tkofpzpiwpuq7lk5xykj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Eda hopes to use this experience and exposure to launch her line of handbags and expand her accessories production. Her experience on the European fashion market has taught her that it takes much more than a good product to make a sale and she hopes to be able to continue developing her brand so that it is attractive to romantic women that have some rock &amp; roll in their lives, like she does.</p>
<p>In addition to winning on her category she also has the opportunity to win the Fan Favorite award which is being held by Bella NY Magazine. You can vote for Eda Aguilar on the following link: </p>

EDA LOURDES PRESS RELEASE
Please read below for more details of the competition and how I got there! 
Fashion accessory designer based in Paris is selected as finalist in prestigious New York fashion accessories competition.
Eda Aguilar, fashion designer from Puerto Rico based in Paris has been selected as finalist of the prestigious handbag design competition, “The Independent Handbag Design Awards” (IHDA), to be held on June 12th, 2019 at the SVA Theater of New  York.

Eda produces her line of fashion accessories between Paris, New York and San Juan (Puerto Rico) and is one out of five finalist in the category “The Aimee Kestenberg “Self Love” Inspired Handbag”. Her proposal named “Coucou” was inspire on her own journey of self love and personal empowerment, under the known English phrase “ME, MYSELF & I… and my essentials”.
“Carrying the ""Coucou"" bag is synonymous to freedom and versatility. To go where you want to go, to do what truly makes you feel happy and filled with self love. Considering that you don’t have to carry the old lady bag of “Petunia” like we say in Puerto Rico” said Eda about her last design. 

The “Coucou” micro can be worn as a necklace, crossbody or also as the very “en vogue” belt bag or “fanny pack”. The bag also has the new measurements 6.76”X4.5”X 1”, required recently by concert halls and sport venues.




If Eda is selected as the winner, she could potentially collaborate with the design team of Aimee Kestenberg to make a bag inspired on Eda’s design. She could also meet with Aimee's CEO & Creative Director to discuss strategies and guidelines on how to improve Eda’s fashion brand, Eda Lourdes. Finally she could be considered for an apprenticeship with the Affordable Luxury Group in New York City among other rewards.


Eda Aguilar, born and raised in Puerto Rico, was drawn to the creative world at a very young age through her involvement with dancing, modeling, television, and theater. Her professional career was in banking where she excelled in finance and investments for 15 years in Puerto Rico New York City. In 2014, she decided to reconnect with her true passion for accessories design and launches her line “Eda Lourdes”. The brand is inspired on the lifestyle and fashion of her favorite cities of San Juan, New York, and Paris.

“Even though I now live in Paris, Puerto Rico is still an essential part of my designs. My mom and my aunts together with other seamstress in the island make by hand important pieces of the line such as capes, gloves, hats, sashs, and lace jewelry.” 


The brand tries to complement the life of a modern woman, which is nowday’s quite active, stylish but busy. “Our accessories are sophisticated, elegant and feminine. They give the perfect last touch to any attire and promise to give new life to the classic “little black dress”, regardless if the dress was inherited from your mother or you have used it on a few occasions”.

Eda Lourdes'  accessories have been sold in the boutiques such as Madonna & Co. in New York City and Escarcha Guaynabo, PR. Although her first collection was only accessories, Eda always dreamed of creating a line of handbags. Since her teenage years she would entertain herself decomposing jewelry from handbags and adding other elements to then create a new bag design. When she was living in New York she made over 30 bags for her girlfriends incorporating fashion trends like lace and Swarovski crystal. In 2017, Eda submitted her first design to the IHDA with an innovative design that had different straps, but it was not until this year when her third submission caught the attention of the judges.
“Is this for real? This is the third time I send a handbag design”. That was Eda’s reaction to the unexpected news. It was Emily Bluenthal, the founder and creator of the IHDA who called her to inform that her design had been selected among thousands of competitors.
The Independent Handbag Designer Awards were created in 2007 to recognize the creativity in handbag designs in the United States and across the world. Now in its 13th edition, the awards are now a staple on the fashion industry given that is the only international design competition that discovers, recognize and create brand awareness for independent handbag designers. Annually about 2000 submissions are sent from designers from 5 continents and 28 countries compete on this prestigious event.
With the objective of formalizing her passion, Eda took courses of business and design from the Parsons The New School for Design” and worked for the blog Rue de Rogues. She has also worked various fashion houses in Paris like IRO, APPARIS, MIRIAM BUDET & LEMLOREN.

Eda hopes to use this experience and exposure to launch her line of handbags and expand her accessories production. Her experience on the European fashion market has taught her that it takes much more than a good product to make a sale and she hopes to be able to continue developing her brand so that it is attractive to romantic women that have some rock & roll in their lives, like she does.
In addition to winning on her category she also has the opportunity to win the Fan Favorite award which is being held by Bella NY Magazine. You can vote for Eda Aguilar on the following link:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Since forever, women of colour have had to make do with beige lingerie. Beige is not nude. It’s not my nude. Is it your nude?</p>
<p>Fed up by the lack of available fashions, our founder, stylist Chantal Carter Taylor, would hand dye bras and panties to match her skin tone. It was a messy waste of time. As women of colour we should be able to buy everyday products that match our skin tone. </p>
<p>Introducing Love &amp; Nudes: wire-free bras &amp; panties designed to match your skin tone, be invisible under your clothing, and be so comfortable you could sleep in them. Because we have better things to do than worry about bunching panty lines, poking under-wires and bras that shine through our tops.</p>

<h2><strong>The Mission</strong></h2>
<p>My mission to uplift women of colour through fashion drove me to launch this brand Love &amp; Nudes, a social movement to celebrate, connect and empower women of colour to cherish the skin they’re in. This intimates line is a vehicle to achieve this mission.</p>
</div><div>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Our goal is to create a global community designed to celebrate, connect and share one another’s individuality and showcase the beauty of difference through social media and events. This intimates line is a vehicle to promote these goals.</p>
<p>The reality is, diverse skin colours are not accurately reflected in the media, fashion or cosmetics industries. These barriers often cause women of colour to feel inferior and less beautiful than women with lighter skin – driving the skin bleaching industry to a staggering ten billion dollars </p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>

<p>Love &amp; Nudes has been an active project for the last 19 months. During this time we have ironed out a lot of challenges and this allows us to be confident in delivering a superb line of intimates to our fabulous customers.

<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>Our lenses reflect parts of the blue-violet light emitted by digital devices, thereby avoiding the retina. <b>Our treatment reduces the transmission drastically between 380 - 455 nm</b> (450 being the most dangerous wavelength), while allowing the healthier blue-turquoise light (&gt;460 nm) to increase our melatonin production, letting us sleep well and improving our circadian rhythm.</p>

<h1><b>Frames</b></h1>
<p><b>Every pair of Barner frames are handmade</b>. Each front shape is cut from a unique flat sheet of 8mm Italian <b>Mazzucchelli acetate</b>, making every pair of frames exclusive. Acetate eyewear require more than 20 different handcrafting processes, making of every eyewear a masterpiece.</p>

<h1>Wire core &amp; hinges</h1>
<p>Together with our eyewear artisan, and based on his experience, we have selected a wire core from a German company that is embedded in every temple. Using this, we reinforce the temples and by mounting the hinge directly to this hardware we get a more solid construction and an excellent movement of the temple. A product that will be with you for a long time.</p>

<p>Based in <b>Barcelona</b>, Barner was founded in early 2017 by three friends, who after living a life totally immersed in the digital world, have identified a problem that is not only affecting themselves but millions of people all around the globe:<b> the overexposure to harmful blue light.  </b></p>
<p>To solve this problem, we have decided to use a disruptive direct-to-consumer model where, by cutting out various middlemen, we will be able to produce the <b>highest quality eyewear at a price that will be affordable to every single pocket.</b></p>
<p> </p>

<p>We three share a common way of looking into the world and this is what we want to bring to life. We are not only producing a great product for your eyes’ health, but a brand for people with common values.</p>
<p>We believe in 2 things:  </p>
<ul><li>For many years we have been using sunglasses to protect our eyes from the sunlight. Nowadays digital screens are surrounding us emitting a new type of light which is <b>very harmful for our health</b>, we should protect from it. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Glasses are cool! You look good with them. </li></ul>
<p>Barner is not only an eyewear company, it is a <b>brand for people with a purpose</b>.</p>

<p>Edu has been working in the digital space for many years. He built his first start-up 7 years ago and has also been working in companies like Samsung and Google for the past 4 years. The inspiration for Barner came up a couple of years ago, when after 1 week of long hours in front of his computer he was feeling fatigue, for the 1st time had some issue falling asleep and of course felt serious dryness in the eyes. Then he started investigating about the harmful effects of blue light and how we could protect from it.</p>

<p>Ramon founded his first start-up 2 years ago while he was working at Accenture as a Management Consultant. Working all day surrounded by digital devices and the blue light emitted by them, he felt his eyes were red and itchy, and had problems sleeping too. Tired of using eye drops, and as soon as Edu contacted him with the idea of Barner, he didn’t hesitate to join them in order to create a brand that will defend people’s health and wellbeing, and promote those values that define him: friendship, family, healthy life and to never stop learning.</p>

<p>Christopher started his career as an early Export Area Manager. After working for more than 5 years opening new markets for an architectural solutions company, he felt he needed to do something else with his life - start his own adventure. Edu contacted him with his great idea, just what he felt he wanted to do: starting from 0 - their own project, about an accessory he’s always been obsessed with but with a totally new concept with a benefit for everyone and with a brand he couldn’t feel more engaged too, he just couldn’t refuse it… Let’s Barner!</p>

</div></div>","At Barner we bring you the coolest eyewear together with premium anti-blue light protection thanks to our collaboration with an international leader in the fields of optics. Since spending extended periods of time in front of electronic devices can harm your eyes, we have designed and created Barner eyewear. A product that will help you:
Sleep better
Improve your comfort and focus when using digital devices
Provide better health & well-being
Always maintain a stylish look
 High Quality Blue Protect lenses (prescription & plain) & Italian Mazzucchelli acetate frames      All these digital devices are emitting harmful blue light and our eyes are not prepared to the overexposure that we are suffering these days. Because of that, a new Digital Sickness called Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) is emerging. Some of the symptoms of this overexposure to blue light are: 
Eyestrain, dry eyes, red eyes, eye fatigue
Headaches, neck pain
Double vision, vertigo/dizziness, difficulty refocusing the eyes
Reduction of melatonin production
Change of sleeping cycles (circadian rhythms)
Macular degeneration
 Sleep deprivation is one of the biggest problems due to blue light overexposure https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-... https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/...     We bring you  3 different models inspired by the coolest neighbourhoods of  New York, London and Berlin. You have 3 different colours to choose from each model making a total of 9 different designs available on Indiegogo. Williamsburg is the epicentre of Brooklyn as a fashionable worldwide brand, the quaint streets are lined with inventive New York restaurants, rooftop bars and eclectic shops, and throngs of people flock to the waterfront for flea markets and giant food bazaars during the summer.         
 
 
 
 


Shoreditch is considered the creative hub of London’s trendy East End. Shoreditch is a goldmine for one-of-a-kind clothes and accessories, with more independent boutiques and vintage shops than you can shake a stick at. 


  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

Kreuzberg is one of Berlin’s quintessential hipster neighbourhoods. The locals call it X-Berg, which sounds like Marvel scraping the barrel for hero names, but the area actually delivers on its promise of finding hidden treasures wherever you look.

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 
 

With this accessory you will now be able to use your Barners in front of the screens but also on the street, relaxing at your favourite beach or breathing some fresh air in the mountains.  
For only 39€ more, your Barners will become 2 products in one. You won’t need to spend more money in sunglasses and won’t have to be carrying 2 set of glasses all day long.  
 

Note: You will be able to choose your Solar clip-on as an extra add-on on the Crowdox survey we will send once we proceed your payment.

At Barner Brand we are in love with our product and we want you to feel the same. That is why we are taking care of every single detail and want to give you more than just a pair of glasses to protect against the harmful blue light. 
We have been working really hard during the last few months, to bring to the market an eyewear with the highest quality materials available.

 

We are partnering with an international leader in the fields of optics who has been contributing to technological optical progress for more than 50 years.
Barner's lenses, have a coating specially developed for people who spend a lot of their time indoors and are exposed to blue-violet light from LEDs as well as smartphones, TV, tablet or computer screens.

 
How it works
Our lenses reflect parts of the blue-violet light emitted by digital devices, thereby avoiding the retina. Our treatment reduces the transmission drastically between 380 - 455 nm (450 being the most dangerous wavelength), while allowing the healthier blue-turquoise light (>460 nm) to increase our melatonin production, letting us sleep well and improving our circadian rhythm.
  

 

 
Other great features offered by Barner lenses
Our lenses have seven ultra-thin layers for incredibly hard lenses with the following characteristics:

Mazzucchelli 1849, an Italian company based in Castiglione Olona, is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and distribution of sheets made of Cellulose Acetate, a polymer of natural origin, traditionally used in the production of optical and sunglass frames.

 
Frames
Every pair of Barner frames are handmade. Each front shape is cut from a unique flat sheet of 8mm Italian Mazzucchelli acetate, making every pair of frames exclusive. Acetate eyewear require more than 20 different handcrafting processes, making of every eyewear a masterpiece.
 

  
Cutting out acetate plaques to start building the frontal
  
Cutting the flat sheet following our Barner's designs
 
Giving a slight curvature to the frontal part
 
Temples
Temples are cut from another sheet of 6mm thickness, heated and molded to reach their standard position. This is a great characteristic of handmade acetate glasses that can be adjusted to achieve the optimum fit for every user.
The Barner logo is lasered and then filled with a special liquified metal paint, to make sure it will never be erased.
 

  
Giving the proper curvature to the temples
 
Manually polishing frontal part & temples
 
Wire core & hinges
Together with our eyewear artisan, and based on his experience, we have selected a wire core from a German company that is embedded in every temple. Using this, we reinforce the temples and by mounting the hinge directly to this hardware we get a more solid construction and an excellent movement of the temple. A product that will be with you for a long time.

We are a very user centric company and we want our users to have the greatest experience since the beginning. This is why we have developed a package with an amazing quality, a great design and filled with great surprises. 
 

 
We have developed 2 different cases for every different moment. The ""Travel case"" is a harder case, perfect to put in your luggage or backpack when travelling in order to avoid big damages on the lenses and frames.
We also have the ""everyday case"", a case to use on a daily basis to carry your glasses around the office and from your home to the bar. Is very light and it will avoid your lenses to scratch.
 

 

These glasses are suitable for any kind of situation. You can use them any time you are in front of your laptop at the office, while using your device in bed before going to sleep, in a meeting room, using your laptop in your favourite bar, reading or watching your favourite series on the sofa and anytime you are moving around using your smartphone. Remember that we have plain & prescription lenses available.

Based in Barcelona, Barner was founded in early 2017 by three friends, who after living a life totally immersed in the digital world, have identified a problem that is not only affecting themselves but millions of people all around the globe: the overexposure to harmful blue light.  
To solve this problem, we have decided to use a disruptive direct-to-consumer model where, by cutting out various middlemen, we will be able to produce the highest quality eyewear at a price that will be affordable to every single pocket.
 

We three share a common way of looking into the world and this is what we want to bring to life. We are not only producing a great product for your eyes’ health, but a brand for people with common values.
We believe in 2 things:  
For many years we have been using sunglasses to protect our eyes from the sunlight. Nowadays digital screens are surrounding us emitting a new type of light which is very harmful for our health, we should protect from it. 
Glasses are cool! You look good with them. 
Barner is not only an eyewear company, it is a brand for people with a purpose.

 

Edu has been working in the digital space for many years. He built his first start-up 7 years ago and has also been working in companies like Samsung and Google for the past 4 years. The inspiration for Barner came up a couple of years ago, when after 1 week of long hours in front of his computer he was feeling fatigue, for the 1st time had some issue falling asleep and of course felt serious dryness in the eyes. Then he started investigating about the harmful effects of blue light and how we could protect from it.

Ramon founded his first start-up 2 years ago while he was working at Accenture as a Management Consultant. Working all day surrounded by digital devices and the blue light emitted by them, he felt his eyes were red and itchy, and had problems sleeping too. Tired of using eye drops, and as soon as Edu contacted him with the idea of Barner, he didn’t hesitate to join them in order to create a brand that will defend people’s health and wellbeing, and promote those values that define him: friendship, family, healthy life and to never stop learning.

Christopher started his career as an early Export Area Manager. After working for more than 5 years opening new markets for an architectural solutions company, he felt he needed to do something else with his life - start his own adventure. Edu contacted him with his great idea, just what he felt he wanted to do: starting from 0 - their own project, about an accessory he’s always been obsessed with but with a totally new concept with a benefit for everyone and with a brand he couldn’t feel more engaged too, he just couldn’t refuse it… Let’s Barner!

For the time being, Barner is just our dream, an idea in our heads that we would love to materialize and make it become a great company that people will be identified with. During the last few months we have worked together with different eyewear experts, developing multiple prototypes with the greatest materials to produce the eyewear you see today.  

The Barner Team reviewing the eyewear's technical drawings
 
In the current stage, we have registered the brand and produced a number of finalized units, but in order to make enough units to share with all of you, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the factory to start our first production. This is why we are offering you our product in this amazing platform before anywhere else. Your support is essential and highly appreciated.

<p>By using magnets, the clasp takes only seconds to form.  It's 
scientifically proven that connecting the earbuds to the audiojack makes
 it difficult to make knots.  Once you make the clasp, wear as a 
necklace/bracelet or put them in your bag/pocket.  The less often they 
are knotted, the less likely they are to break!</p>

<p><b>loopit</b> comes in two designs:  </p>
<p>1.  A wired cable threaded through a light weight aluminum chain.

<p>Each set will also come with three different sized earbud tips since every person’s ear is shaped a little bit differently.</p>
<h1><b>3. Sublime audio</b></h1>
<p>We tested dozens of prototypes to find ones that sound great.  The 
speaker has an impressive frequency response, sensitivity and input 
power. The shape of the earbuds also help with blocking out background 
noise. Not only is the sound clear to you but with the built in 
microphone you can be sure your voice is heard clearly.</p>

talking about that moment of ultimate frustration. The moment when, you 
reach into your bag to grab your headphones, only to find them in knots,
 lots of knots. With loopit those days are over.






Loopit is a practical & stylish solution to the tangled 
headphone problem we all have. They are headphones that almost never 
tangle when clasped and can be worn as a stylish necklace or stuffed in a
 bag or pocket if jewelry isn't your thing. With the clasp formed, the 
headphones are not likely to tangle.



                                                     loopit's patent pending clasp















     The patent pending loopit clasp



Wear loopit as a necklace or pull it from your pocket/purse 
and give it a shake. When you need your headphones, simply pull the 
magnets apart and plug into your device. When you are done using them, 
unplug loopit and connect the magnets near the earbuds to the magnets near the audiojack, to form a clasp.




                                                              How to use loopit






1. 3 seconds for tangle free earbuds
By using magnets, the clasp takes only seconds to form.  It's 
scientifically proven that connecting the earbuds to the audiojack makes
 it difficult to make knots.  Once you make the clasp, wear as a 
necklace/bracelet or put them in your bag/pocket.  The less often they 
are knotted, the less likely they are to break!
2. Stylish but understated
loopit comes in two designs:  
1.  A wired cable threaded through a light weight aluminum chain. 
 This design can be worn as a fashionable yet understated necklace and 
we plan to offer it in the following colors:



                  black & silver,       black & gold,       white & silver


2. A high quality stitched leather-like cord in black for those not into metallic jewelry.





Each set will also come with three different sized earbud tips since every person’s ear is shaped a little bit differently.
3. Sublime audio
We tested dozens of prototypes to find ones that sound great.  The 
speaker has an impressive frequency response, sensitivity and input 
power. The shape of the earbuds also help with blocking out background 
noise. Not only is the sound clear to you but with the built in 
microphone you can be sure your voice is heard clearly.




 




                 Loopit in detail 
























You waste 3.5 days of our life untangling headphones.  Loopit will change that









Our process is simple, yet thorough.
We start with an everyday problem and end up with a solution that’s better and funner. (That’s right – we said “funner.”)









Vanessa Chan was a partner at McKinsey & Company, but decided to 
walk away from what was comfortable to start re.design. A trained 
engineer and mom, Vanessa knew how to solve problems and saw them all 
around her in everyday products that had become more frustrating than 
useful. 
Like ear buds – the first problem she tackled. 
By mashing up her MIT training and inherent creativity, Vanessa 
conceived a versatile solution to those pesky ear buds that combines 
fashion and function. 
​It turns out that, if you’ve got the engineering chops to sketch out
 a prototype, there’s a thriving maker community in the Philadelphia 
area that you can work at to crank out prototypes - places like NextFab 
and BeadWorks. 
An inveterate networker, Vanessa supports women professionals as 
co-president of the Philadelphia Chapter of the Ellevate Network. She 
also helps K-12 students bring their ideas to market as an advisor for 
Springside Chestnut Hill Academy's Venture Incubator and as a member of 
their board of trustees
Vanessa has a Ph.D. from MIT in Materials Science & Engineering 
and a B.S.E. from University of Pennsylvania. She is married to Mark van

<p><b>How safe is Looblade for children?</b></p>
<p>Very much safer than a conventional toilet brush. The unit and
holder are made from materials that have a thru-structure antimicrobial to
International Standards Organisation certification, ISO22196:2011. LooBlade is safer than the toilet floor surfaces surrounding it, except when they've just been antiseptically cleaned, then comparably safe. But floors will quickly build
up bacteria again. LooBlade goes on neutralising germs 24/7.</p>
<p><b>Are the antimicrobial and hydrophobic elements just a coating?</b></p>
<p>No, both of these properties are designed into LooBlade. They are added
to the liquid plastics before manufacture so they are through the entire
product and holder.</p>
<p><b>How hygienic are the materials?</b></p>
<p>The plastics are the standard that food and medical products
need to be. We certify this to ISO22196:2011, using the world
respected German TüV laboratories.</p>
<p><b>How sustainable are the materials?</b></p>
<p>We worked hard to identify and source the most sustainable materials
we can for LooBlade. We opted for the newest technologies in plastics that
are completely recyclable, phthalate and bisphenol-A free, durable and long
lasting. Totally safe to use.</p>
<p><b>What about mold build-up or lime that requires scrubbing?</b></p>
<p>Brushes tend to leave more
than you think on a porcelain surface. The remaining bacterial film then spreads and acts as an adhesive for other nasties.
Brushes also carry a ‘charge’ of germs incubated in the holder which increases the problem. Even when you immerse a brush in bleach, the deep crevices within the bristles
means that they always retain a significant  'starter' load of bacteria
ready to breed and be reintroduced to the toilet. </p>
<p>LooBlades elastomer vanes are far more effective on matter on a
smooth porcelain surface and promote less
build up. <span>When it's easy, nothing should be left to accumulate! </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">You might say, LooBlade takes a disruptive view of the culture of toilet cleaning! </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Because brushes are so awful and ineffective we

Brushes tend to leave more
than you think on a porcelain surface. The remaining bacterial film then spreads and acts as an adhesive for other nasties.
Brushes also carry a ‘charge’ of germs incubated in the holder which increases the problem. Even when you immerse a brush in bleach, the deep crevices within the bristles
means that they always retain a significant  'starter' load of bacteria
ready to breed and be reintroduced to the toilet. 
LooBlades elastomer vanes are far more effective on matter on a
smooth porcelain surface and promote less
build up. When it's easy, nothing should be left to accumulate! You might say, LooBlade takes a disruptive view of the culture of toilet cleaning! Because brushes are so awful and ineffective we
have a bad regime of cleaning...because it's nasty and not easy. We subconsciously hate the way brushes function. We know that
even to bring them from their holder to the toilet is a nasty process. LooBlade changes all that...
Is it safe to use the the Looblade with toilet cleaners that contain
chlorine bleach or ammonia?
Yes, absolutely safe. LooBlade is inert to household chemicals. 
(N.B. Remember never to mix bleach and ammonia together as highly toxic chlorine can be released!)",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our helmets have achieved safety certification for European (EN1078) and North American (CPSC) testing standards.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">There is often a misconception that safety helmets must be a one-piece design in order to absorb an impact and protect the skull. This isn't the case. In fact, many motorcycle helmets are made from strips of EPS (the impact absorbing material which sits closest to the head) at the protective core, covered by a thin, one-piece outer shell.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Each helmet segment in LID's multi-piece design has its own, independent, ability to absorb impact, thereby protecting the rider's skull.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lidhelmet.com/static/indiegogo/TESTING.gif"" src=""""/></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Q: If you’re this far along, why do you need Indiegogo?</strong></u></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">A: We’re launching LID in a M – L size (55-58cm / 21 5/8"" - 22 7/8 "" / Hat Size: 6 3/4 - 7 ¼), which captures the average head sizes for both males (55 cm / 21 ¾ in) and females (57cm / 22 ½ in). However, some riders will require a smaller size than this and some will need a larger size. The use of proceeds from our Indiegogo campaign will be used to cover the cost of the tooling for these sizes, which isn’t cheap! Therefore, when we progress to normal retail distribution, we’ll have a full-size range to offer riders across the world.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>And what about the kids?? </strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We also want to introduce a kid’s range too.

We did this because unlike a lot of other lifestyle products, helmets are <strong>all about</strong> the safety integrity. We know that it would have been asking a lot to show you a prototype and trust us that we’d not only get a lengthy product development process and pass the strenuous impact safety tests. So, we’ve taken away all of that uncertainty and done all of the hard work before sharing our product and ambitions with you.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Now, all that’s left to do is receive your backing, then place the order with our manufacturer.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Q: How are LID’s helmets manufactured?</strong></u></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">A: We spent a lot of time researching and finding the right suppliers and manufacturers. After consulting with a University with a globally-leading sports engineering department, we were introduced to our manufacturer, who produce helmets for almost all of the top helmet brands in the world (cycle, ski, motorcycle and horse riding).</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">We use a full-wrap in-mold process which combines the EPS inner core of the helmet (which absorbs impact) with the outer polycarbonate shell. This produces the highest quality of finishes.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Unlike other helmet brands, we’ve chosen to produce our helmets from recycled EPS. Rather than filling the world’s landfills further, we are working with a leading auto manufacturer in the USA to collect their packaging materials used in transporting delicate auto parts. The polystyrene is compressed and reformulated into pellets that can be expanded to the desired density, creating EPS. This eco-friendly EPS has been strenuously tested against virgin EPS and delivers the same level of safety required by testing standards. It's more costly to produce this way, but we think it’s worth it.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Q: Why are you making the helmet available in only one size?</strong></u></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">A: Tooling costs are expensive, so that’s why we need the support of the Indiegogo community – to help us cover the costs to introduce other size options. Our M-L launch size will satisfy most riders, but we know some people will need a smaller helmet and others will need a larger offering. After a successful campaign, we’ll have those options available before moving onto standard retail distribution.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Q: How much does a LID Helmet weigh?</strong></u></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">A: 410 grams, which is light-weight in comparison to many other urban design bike helmets on the market.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Q: How much does shipping cost?</strong></u></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">A: Shipping is included in the price you'll pay for any of the perks you choose.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Q: What kind of warranty do you offer?</strong></u></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">A: LID Helmets warrants that our helmets will be free of any manufacturing defects in material and workmanship when it is delivered to you.

We’re extremely proud and grateful for over 300 backers around the world supporting our vision. We’re now working hard to get our 1st production of LID helmets onto the heads of our backers. For everyone else interested in getting their hands on a LID helmet, you can sign up to our mailing list and be the 1st to know when we’re ready to start shipping: www.lidhelmet.com.       We’re launching LID Helmets to address a common complaint amongst urban, commuter cyclists – what to do with your bike helmet when you’re not wearing it? Some riders lock it to their bike, some dangle it from their bag. However, ‘helmet hassle’ can be so bad that many riders don’t bother wearing one, or even worse, pass on cycling altogether. LID wants to change this by introducing an eco-friendly helmet which folds to slip into your bag and is so stylish, that no rider will ever have an excuse not to wear a helmet again.   We know that when it comes to helmets, style or convenience is nothing unless you deliver safety too. For this reason, we have spent two-years developing LID and putting it through rigorous testing to guarantee a safe product. The LID helmet is officially safety certified and has already achieved the official safety testing certification to European (EN1078) and North American (CPSC) standards.  LID helmet compacts down and fits your bag. No more hassle of carrying around a bulky helmet!  Fits in your bag. We know helmets are a hassle, so we've designed ours to make life easier and safer. Our unique helmet design cascades, allowing the helmet to compact into a size and shape which easily slips into backpacks, satchels, or tote handbags.Fits your head. Further helping with the fit, we’ve included a 4-notch adjustment system and Velcro band, which allows for additional fit-tailoring. Our chin-strap padding feature also prevents any irritating strap-burn.Comfortable. LID's multi-piece design automatically adjusts itself to the rider's head shape, providing a truly snug fit. The adjustable fit system further allows the rider to tailor the fit of the helmet within the size range.Keeps you cool. LID’s multi-piece design channels airflow to the rider’s scalp, preventing over-heating. Other one-piece or folding, urban designed helmets are often found to be ‘sweat buckets’ – not LID’s!Fits your style. LID's clean lines, urban profile and bold colours provide ‘safety in colour’, making LID a helmet you’ll want to wear everywhere. We'll have 5 matte-finish colour options available.Clip-on light. As we’re talking about safety, we also integrated into our design a rear-anchor point for a clip-on, USB rechargeable, safety light, making you the rider more visible when on the road. At LID, we have chosen to manufacturer our helmets from recycled expanded polystyrene - the main component for producing safety helmets. Although this is a more costly manufacturing process, working towards a sustainable future is an ethos at the core of the LID brand. The polystyrene is initially used in packaging delicate auto parts by a leading US auto manufacturer. The packaging is then collected, compressed and reformulated into pellets which can be expanded to the required density for making our safety helmets. The impact absorption properties of the recycled EPS match those of the primary market option.We want to be at the center of facilitating more commuters to ride bikes in cities. We’re concerned about the air quality in our cities. Spiralling populations across the globe are causing serious issues in large cities. Limited space means a rise in vehicle congestion, pollution and a strain on public transport systems. Additionally, obesity is rapidly catching tobacco-use as the Number 1 cause of preventable death. Besides walking, cycling is the most cost-effective and effective offset to these serious issues.So if you share our vision, get a perk and support us!  All helmets are designed to adjustto fit a range of head sizes.  To make sure you get the right size andinstructions on how to fit and adjust the helmet properly,please watch our Fit Guide video. We’re different to most product crowdfunding projects – we’ve already done the hard work and paid for it ourselves.

Staying true to this mission, we’ve chosen to produce our helmets from recycled EPS (the main component in helmets, which absorbs the impact force), despite the higher manufacturing cost of doing so.   The first stage of the production process has already begun for LID. Our helmets are manufactured in China at a highly-rated production facility. We have already produced the first batch of safety approved samples to share with the media and potential retailers. After the Indiegogo campaign closes, we will collate the orders and begin the fulfillment process for a May delivery.For us, it was really important to create a campaign that is as risk-free to the backers as possible. We have spent a lot of time and money on the product development and safety certifications so we could offer you a ready high-quality product - not a prototype! Our product is ready to go and all we need to do is make the order from the factory. This will cut down the delivery time exponentially compared to most crowdfunding campaigns that might take a year or more to deliver.  Our manufacturing is lined-up and ready to go, so we really don’t see any risks & challenges!For press inquiries: hello@lidhelmet.com For Backer support: indiegogo@lidhelmet.comQ: It’s foldable, but is it safe?A: Our foldable helmet, LID, is designed to remove some of the hassles of carrying a bike helmet, but what isn't removed is the safety integrity you’d expect from a traditional helmet. Our helmets have achieved safety certification for European (EN1078) and North American (CPSC) testing standards.There is often a misconception that safety helmets must be a one-piece design in order to absorb an impact and protect the skull. This isn't the case. In fact, many motorcycle helmets are made from strips of EPS (the impact absorbing material which sits closest to the head) at the protective core, covered by a thin, one-piece outer shell.Each helmet segment in LID's multi-piece design has its own, independent, ability to absorb impact, thereby protecting the rider's skull.Q: If you’re this far along, why do you need Indiegogo?A: We’re launching LID in a M – L size (55-58cm / 21 5/8"" - 22 7/8 "" / Hat Size: 6 3/4 - 7 ¼), which captures the average head sizes for both males (55 cm / 21 ¾ in) and females (57cm / 22 ½ in). However, some riders will require a smaller size than this and some will need a larger size. The use of proceeds from our Indiegogo campaign will be used to cover the cost of the tooling for these sizes, which isn’t cheap! Therefore, when we progress to normal retail distribution, we’ll have a full-size range to offer riders across the world.And what about the kids?? We also want to introduce a kid’s range too. A successful campaign will help us do it.Q: I know it’s safe, but what if I live outside the regions you’ve achieved safety certification?A: Unless you live in Australia / New Zealand, the safety certification that we’ve achieved will mean we can ship you a LID helmet. Q: We see so many cool ideas on crowdfunding platforms that over-promise and under-deliver on their shipment date, why are you different?A: Unlike a lot of crowdfunding projects, we have chosen to take our product through the development phase first before launching. We did this because unlike a lot of other lifestyle products, helmets are all about the safety integrity. We know that it would have been asking a lot to show you a prototype and trust us that we’d not only get a lengthy product development process and pass the strenuous impact safety tests. So, we’ve taken away all of that uncertainty and done all of the hard work before sharing our product and ambitions with you.Now, all that’s left to do is receive your backing, then place the order with our manufacturer.Q: How are LID’s helmets manufactured?A: We spent a lot of time researching and finding the right suppliers and manufacturers. After consulting with a University with a globally-leading sports engineering department, we were introduced to our manufacturer, who produce helmets for almost all of the top helmet brands in the world (cycle, ski, motorcycle and horse riding).We use a full-wrap in-mold process which combines the EPS inner core of the helmet (which absorbs impact) with the outer polycarbonate shell. This produces the highest quality of finishes.Unlike other helmet brands, we’ve chosen to produce our helmets from recycled EPS. Rather than filling the world’s landfills further, we are working with a leading auto manufacturer in the USA to collect their packaging materials used in transporting delicate auto parts. The polystyrene is compressed and reformulated into pellets that can be expanded to the desired density, creating EPS. This eco-friendly EPS has been strenuously tested against virgin EPS and delivers the same level of safety required by testing standards. It's more costly to produce this way, but we think it’s worth it.Q: Why are you making the helmet available in only one size?A: Tooling costs are expensive, so that’s why we need the support of the Indiegogo community – to help us cover the costs to introduce other size options. Our M-L launch size will satisfy most riders, but we know some people will need a smaller helmet and others will need a larger offering. After a successful campaign, we’ll have those options available before moving onto standard retail distribution.Q: How much does a LID Helmet weigh?A: 410 grams, which is light-weight in comparison to many other urban design bike helmets on the market.  Q: How much does shipping cost?A: Shipping is included in the price you'll pay for any of the perks you choose.Q: What kind of warranty do you offer?A: LID Helmets warrants that our helmets will be free of any manufacturing defects in material and workmanship when it is delivered to you. This warranty is limited to one year from the time of delivery to you. This warranty does not apply in the event of incorrect size selection, abuse, negligence, carelessness, or if the product is used in any way other than is intended. Q: Can I get a refund?A: Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy here. If you have any questions regarding refunds, please contact returns@lidhelmet.com.",70.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Made By a History Nerd, For Other History Nerds</h3>
<p>​For as long as I can remember, I've had an obsession with 18th Century America, Colonial American, and Revolutionary War period. Ever since childhood, the sound of fife and drum playing in the distance had the same effect of a moth to a flame, and the sight of someone wearing a tricorn hat caused me stare with wide-eyed wonder. Even today, I wish I could yell ""Huzzah!"" in the general public without disapproving looks from strangers. </p>

<h4>Why Indiegogo?</h4>
We’re
changemakers, new to the game, and we like fresh ways of thinking.  We feel the love in our matron-run village
communities but we’re equally after public validation and this means you.  Crowdfunding is an ingenious way to help us
in our efforts to get both word and product out to the world but it is ‘all or
nothing’ and that is a concern.  50% of
humanity is female and the talents and traditions of these women deserve
recognition.  At APOCCAS, we’re just the
catalysts: our mission is to uncover and streamline their skills into heirloom
designs.  Indiegogo facilitates: it
provides a platform for us to showcase what we believe in and for you to
endorse empowerment for our artisans.<p></p>

<h4>Your support can be more than financial</h4>
<p>Empowering people is gratifying for everyone.  Thank you for absorbing the essence of our
initiative.  If you’re ready to back us –
magnificent!  If you’re not feeling
money-generous but do buy into our dream, there’s room to spread our word with
your family, networks and friends.  Open
doors to other changemakers if you can. 
The world is ready to be a better place.</p>
<h4>Risks &amp; challenges</h4>
As with
anything handmade, our biggest challenge is time.  Most of our yarns are spun, reeled, dyed and
woven not by machines, but by human hands. 
Delays may occur in light of the complex processes during manufacture
although we set realistic production and delivery dates. Unexpected village
ceremonies or heavier than usual downpours during Thailand’s rainy season,
floods and quarterly rice harvest chores may disrupt the best of goodwill
further but we’re all about communicating and problem solving and will post
regular updates throughout.<br/><p></p>

TRUE CHAMPION: The APOCCAS revolution



{Spearhead the way to revive Eri silk in northern Thailand -
let's make it happen}
Stretch goals
Wondering if there’s room to invest your time and money
even once we’ve reached our goal?  Think
no further.  This campaign introduces
nine of our collection styles and lets you own them now.  
In case our funding goal is exceeded we are prepared.  We have tucked into our starting blocks to
gear up production for another six scarf collections and three throw designs
for sitting around a bonfire or beautifying the home.  Your contribution will pay ‘fairly’ and
directly for the making and marketing of these treasures that you can admire
below.  From the cotton or silk farmer to
the master weaver.

Collection: ZIG & ZAG, HONY & MARI throws, UPCY, LOOS, KORA, GONG &
1/1 UNIQUE scarves}

Why Indiegogo?
We’re
changemakers, new to the game, and we like fresh ways of thinking.  We feel the love in our matron-run village
communities but we’re equally after public validation and this means you.  Crowdfunding is an ingenious way to help us
in our efforts to get both word and product out to the world but it is ‘all or
nothing’ and that is a concern.  50% of
humanity is female and the talents and traditions of these women deserve
recognition.  At APOCCAS, we’re just the
catalysts: our mission is to uncover and streamline their skills into heirloom
designs.  Indiegogo facilitates: it
provides a platform for us to showcase what we believe in and for you to
endorse empowerment for our artisans.






Your support can be more than financial
Empowering people is gratifying for everyone.  Thank you for absorbing the essence of our
initiative.  If you’re ready to back us –
magnificent!  If you’re not feeling
money-generous but do buy into our dream, there’s room to spread our word with
your family, networks and friends.  Open
doors to other changemakers if you can. 
The world is ready to be a better place.
Risks & challenges
As with
anything handmade, our biggest challenge is time.  Most of our yarns are spun, reeled, dyed and
woven not by machines, but by human hands. 
Delays may occur in light of the complex processes during manufacture
although we set realistic production and delivery dates. Unexpected village
ceremonies or heavier than usual downpours during Thailand’s rainy season,
floods and quarterly rice harvest chores may disrupt the best of goodwill
further but we’re all about communicating and problem solving and will post
regular updates throughout.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/></p>MY STORY
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My name is Aku-Sika Barrett. I was born and raised in Ghana. As a child I had a passion for textile, fashion, and traveling. I always craved uniqueness and individualism. The last of 5 children,  I  tried to set myself apart from my older sisters, by adopting my own unique style.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My career started as a Stenographer Secretary, then I went to American Airlines Academy to pursue a course in Travel and Tourism.  Unfortunately, I had to put my career on hold to accompany my husband on his foreign assignments.  When we relocated to Cairo in 1992,  I had so much time on my hands, until I discovered the art of painting on silk;  I pursued it with a passion, and later opened my own design studio in Jakarta Indonesia and later in Doha Qatar to teach others.  Being able to create my own designs on silk made it easy for me to express my unique sense of style; giving birth to a business idea.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2004, when we moved to Portugal, I started my company, producing hand painted silk accessories like scarves and ties.  My dream was to turn my beautiful paintings into Couture garments, and shoes. I realized those dreams when I employed a Couturière and also received my first shoe sample from the manufactures in Spain.    Since then, I have had unique shoes made for me in Italy and in Peru.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My desire to know how to draw and learn about fashion design led me to the prestigious fashion school in Milan (Istituto Marangoni).  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">People adored my hand painted silk clothing wherever I went, but when they wanted some, I could only grin and shrug, because I couldn't duplicate.  I always found it difficult parting with the pieces because I got so attached to them.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am now ready to launch  a high-end  Ready To Wear collection from my painted silk, so that I can satisfy prospective clients, and start my own Silk Emporium.  I have spent the last couple of years researching digital printing, testing fabrics and the market. I have produced my prototypes, and now, it is time to go into production, but I will need your help.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">To succeed, I have to do something different, hence this project.  This campaign therefore, is to raise sufficient funds to produce, launch and market the collection and help sustain the business.   <br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>The new brand ""onoo - intelligent urban clothing"" incorporates 3 mens 
jacket styles for 
delivery in autumn 2015.</p>
<p>The short coat ""Lehel"" and jacket 
""Sendling"" use natural and technical materials with a tailored fit. 
Maximum freedom of movement is combined with a wind and water resistant 
Loden fabric which has a Teflon coating for extra protection. New high 
quality rubberized buttons in horn optics are novel and compliment the 
water-repellent zips in leather look. The blouson/bomber jacket 
""Westend"", our sporty jacket version, also has these features. The outer
 material is however made from a technically advanced waterproof and 
breathable nylon fabric.</p>
<p>Tailored to the needs of mobile urban 
people featuring functional features which optimize these Jackets and 
make them unique garments in form and function.  </p>
<p><span style="""">The jackets are intelligent because they are designed in a minimalistic urban style suited to the modern man of today but are created to protect you from bad winter conditions without looking like functional outdoor garments, they are suited to wear while riding your bike, scooter or on foot.</span></p>

<h3>What is the project goal and who is the project for?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to establish qualitative and appealing fashion with 
function properties and to establish onoo as a new brand within the next
 3-5 years. In addition, the collections will be continuously developed 
and updated and expanded.</p>
<p>We are targeting mobile city dwellers 
whether they are on a bike, scooter or in the subway on the way, to the 
office, a customer meeting or dinner with friends.</p>
<p>Our target 
group are people from different creative industries, from the management
 sector, marketing individuals, journalists and writers, entrepreneurs 
and people like you who are looking for an alternative smart niche product 
with innovative design features.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why are we a luxury priced product?</h3>One of our main goals at onoo design is to create a garment that stands up to it's quality expectations and to use traditional fabrics  from local factories in Europe wherever possible.  To achieve this standard of excellence in our product we have to  often pay a high price for the production, which then makes the retail price higher. onoo is a luxury product because it is unique in it's design, it is limited on the market and you can trust our quality seal.</div>
<div>
<span style="""">We at onoo decided  to make a product that is ""</span><b style="""">Made in Italy</b><span style="""">"" because we believe in the factory that produces onoo and trust their quality for our luxury brand. We trust the workmanship and fit and the fact that it is not a mass produced product, the quantities are limited and we do not need to travel far to visit them or recieve our goods. We know them personally and are priviledged to work with craftsmen and craftswomen who like our product and because they have worked on our project since the beginning and treat onoo like their own ""baby"".</span><br/>

<p>Several studies have confirmed over the last few years a new

friendly modes of transport. Current sales figures of design bicycles or

<p>onoo jackets are for people who are outside in rain and bad weather and commute to their work or meet with friends and need to be protected from the elements with our intelligent urban clothing which is smart but has hidden functional properties.<br/>
</p>
<p>Wherever
 we present onoo – and when the jackets are tried on, we get 
consistently a positive response to the materials used, the modern fit, quality and finish and above all to the underlying idea to offer fashion with

Q: Which sizes can I order?A: We will produce the sizes S, M, L and XL. The jackets are slim fit, Italian style, so if you are not sure order a bigger size!, but don't worry we shall contact you by email after the campaign to make sure you get the right size.
Q: Why do EU contributers need to pay VATA: As a company registered in the EU we are required by law to charge VAT 
to EU contributors. However, if you are ordering on behalf of an 
European company with a valid VAT ID, you don't need to add VAT to your 
perk. Simply provide us with your VAT ID when we will ask you to do so 
by mail.

Q: I live in the EU and forgot to add VAT to my payment

A: Don´t worry – you’re not the only one!
Once the campaign has ended, we will contact each contributor about 
outstanding costs. We will also give you instructions on how to pay.
Q: I forgot to add the shipping costs?A: Please use the perks button at the right of the video. 
The shipping charge to the EU is $25.
The shipping charge to the US and the rest of the world is $45.

You went to the shoe store to pick out new shoes. You put your foot on that cool metal foot-measurer, you rested your foot on the sales person's knee, they cinched up your laces and then you ran around the store to see how they felt. You wiggled around in front of the mirror and caught a glimpse of yourself in new shoes. Pretty cool. </span></p>
<p>Yep, I remember.</p>
<p><i><b>Where did all the shoe stores go!?<span><br/></span></b></i><b><i>We're swimming with kids! Why don't we have a dedicated kids shoe store?</i></b> </p>
<p>The ones with people who really knew what they were talking about. They knew that ""this brand runs big"", and ""this brand runs wide"". They helped you get the right fit and understood that children's feet are <i>growing feet. </i></p>
<p>It's important- ya know? Getting the right fit for growing feet! Did you know that the bones in children's feet are still malleable? <a href=""http://www.drgangemi.com/kids/childs-shoe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Family Physician Mark Cucuzzella says, ""It’s vital that kid’s shoes allow enough room for natural growth, until the foot bones mature.

All of these brands pay special attention to producing shoes that are <i>good for feet</i>. They have podiatrists on staff that counsel the designers in keeping a roomy toe-box for those growin' toes, appropriate flex in the right places, and all the little details we care about. Kids spend a lot of time in shoes these days. It turns out, if toes get squished, it hinders proper development. Most shoes that come from giant corporate stores (we'll-keep-them-nameless!) are poorly made. They fall apart quickly and have little or no support for our childrens' growing feet. We want to love our kiddos from the ground up. We'll carry sizes 3-Y4.</p> <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>...psst!</b> Love a shoe brand that we haven't thought of yet?

</div></div>","Remember when you were a kid? You went to the shoe store to pick out new shoes. You put your foot on that cool metal foot-measurer, you rested your foot on the sales person's knee, they cinched up your laces and then you ran around the store to see how they felt. You wiggled around in front of the mirror and caught a glimpse of yourself in new shoes. Pretty cool. 
Yep, I remember.
Where did all the shoe stores go!?We're swimming with kids! Why don't we have a dedicated kids shoe store? 
The ones with people who really knew what they were talking about. They knew that ""this brand runs big"", and ""this brand runs wide"". They helped you get the right fit and understood that children's feet are growing feet. 
It's important- ya know? Getting the right fit for growing feet! Did you know that the bones in children's feet are still malleable? Family Physician Mark Cucuzzella says, ""It’s vital that kid’s shoes allow enough room for natural growth, until the foot bones mature. This doesn’t happen until ages 18-19 for girls and 20-21 for boys.""
We will bring back the experience, the knowledge, the brick-and-mortar.We will bring back the actual shoe store. 
Oh! and how about a play area for siblings?We're parents too, ya know. Our littlest will happily climb up and jump off of anything she can scale. (*please note little Miss Wiggles, pictured below.) We know why it can be hard to take kids out shopping. One kid runs for the elevator while the other dances with the mannequins. We get it!
We'll have a play area full of enticing things for kids to play with so parents can focus on...well...shoes!

This is our family. 

Our kids wear shoes. 



We like cool shoes. We like unique shoes. We like cute shoes. 
We like to buy shoes in local stores.  

We like to support the community. We think community is what makes the world go 'round.
We like to buy shoes that are made to support our childrens' growing feet. We like sales people who get kids. We like sales people who know what they're talking about.
We like children's shoe stores with a great selection. 
These are shoes being offered by the brands we love this season...






               We love Pediped, Stride Rite, Plae, Tsukihoshi, Keen, See Kai Run, Livie and Luca and even more. All of these brands pay special attention to producing shoes that are good for feet. They have podiatrists on staff that counsel the designers in keeping a roomy toe-box for those growin' toes, appropriate flex in the right places, and all the little details we care about. Kids spend a lot of time in shoes these days. It turns out, if toes get squished, it hinders proper development. Most shoes that come from giant corporate stores (we'll-keep-them-nameless!) are poorly made. They fall apart quickly and have little or no support for our childrens' growing feet. We want to love our kiddos from the ground up. We'll carry sizes 3-Y4. ...psst! Love a shoe brand that we haven't thought of yet? Please let us know (and then help us make it happen by shooting us a little donation!) 
TaDaaa! GoldenBug Children's Shoes.

The culmination of these observations and investigations result in design outcomes achieved not only by products, but also through systems, services and interactions.</p><p>In addition, many of these projects were conducted with industry collaborators such as Ministry of Manpower and National University Hospital. The plethora of works in this year's show echoes the division's vision, to make life better through design.</p><p>This year in particular, in sync with the SG50 celebrations, we hope to extend our outreach to the masses through the show, to raise public awareness about the importance of Design, and how relevant it is to our daily lives. It is important that we acknowledge this in order for our Singapore Design Community to grow.</p><p>____________________________________________________________________________</p><p><br/></p><p>In this year’s show, we have categorized our projects according to 3 main groups that we find most relevant to our Singaporean Lifestyle: </p><p>1. <b>Health &amp; Wellness </b></p><p>The projects that fall under this category mainly consist of projects that address medical issues that we hold close to our hearts such as dementia, diabetes, stress, etc. Collaboration with various centres that deal with such conditions, our students explore the possibilities of improving the lives of patients and their families through design.</p><p><span><br/></span>2. <b>Culture &amp; Communication</b><br/>Not all is lost. People say that Singapore is a young nation with pseudo-culture, but we beg to differ. It’s the people that make our country who we are and we’re the makers, the creators. By using culture and craft as a context to design, the projects aim to rethink the contemporary Singapore culture. With projects extending to redesign the traditional Batik process and Kopitiams, as well as those that develop new uses and techniques for existing materials for bag and furniture forms, the possibilities are limitless.</p><p><b><span><br/></span>3. </b><b>Interaction &amp; Technology</b><br/>Re-evaluating our lifestyle in Singapore, this category of projects serve as a way for us to envision the future.

</div></div>","The annual NUS Industrial Design 2015 show offers a complete overview of works by the Graduating Class, highlighted works by current students of the faculty from the past academic year, as well as latest projects by the Design Incubation Centre (DIC).  The theme of this year's show is Momentum, and it offers a glimpse into the multifaceted world of design, whereby students take a critical role in investigating relationships between objects, users and environment. The culmination of these observations and investigations result in design outcomes achieved not only by products, but also through systems, services and interactions.In addition, many of these projects were conducted with industry collaborators such as Ministry of Manpower and National University Hospital. The plethora of works in this year's show echoes the division's vision, to make life better through design.This year in particular, in sync with the SG50 celebrations, we hope to extend our outreach to the masses through the show, to raise public awareness about the importance of Design, and how relevant it is to our daily lives. It is important that we acknowledge this in order for our Singapore Design Community to grow.____________________________________________________________________________In this year’s show, we have categorized our projects according to 3 main groups that we find most relevant to our Singaporean Lifestyle: 1. Health & Wellness The projects that fall under this category mainly consist of projects that address medical issues that we hold close to our hearts such as dementia, diabetes, stress, etc. Collaboration with various centres that deal with such conditions, our students explore the possibilities of improving the lives of patients and their families through design.2. Culture & CommunicationNot all is lost. People say that Singapore is a young nation with pseudo-culture, but we beg to differ. It’s the people that make our country who we are and we’re the makers, the creators. By using culture and craft as a context to design, the projects aim to rethink the contemporary Singapore culture. With projects extending to redesign the traditional Batik process and Kopitiams, as well as those that develop new uses and techniques for existing materials for bag and furniture forms, the possibilities are limitless.3. Interaction & TechnologyRe-evaluating our lifestyle in Singapore, this category of projects serve as a way for us to envision the future. Ranging from progressive toys for children to green lifestyle products and improving communication amongst people, we aim to keep up with the ever-changing times through design, as we progress as a nation.We hope to extend our outreach to the masses by demonstrating to everyone how they can benefit from design, both as solutions to problems and also as a driver for social and cultural change. Many of our Industrial Design projects have gained global recognition in international competitions and we think that through the NUS Industrial Design Show 2015, we can build a stronger Singapore Design Community. Through this endeavor, we hope to exemplify the Singaporean spirit of not letting our dreams be bound by our size. The following are some of the past works by the graduating class: +one Prosthetic Fingers The functional yet life-like prosthetic finger that is able to fit and support users in the handling of simple daily tasks. This project was featured in The New Paper and got shortlisted as Regional Finalist for the James Dyson Award 2013.

novel, and ""Kiddie Litter"" lent itself perfectly to the webseries

<p> Who we are: 21 year old Lucy Lott grew up in a small town in western New York while 23 year old Brett Seamans, the son of a Navy Seabee, traveled all over the east coast growing up. We met at the Rochester Institute of Technology while studying photography. We started a small collaborative project, LCB, which developed into a full partnership. We have been working together for over a year and a half shooting fashion/editorial work and found out that we are stronger as a team than we ever could be apart. We botg live and breathe photography and it is our only true passion. For us, it’s not just a career, but a lifestyle. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://tinypic.com?ref=i3z8sj"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Image and video hosting by TinyPic"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i50.tinypic.com/i3z8sj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>LCB started out just as a name under which the two of us could gather our collaborative photography efforts. We always loved cinematography and Lucy has always been inspired by design and fine arts. As we worked day in and day out together, we started to incorporate each other’s strengths into our creations. We realized that our interests in other areas could be integrated into our work, making it more unique and setting us apart from other photographers.  Now, we are doing more with video, but we’ve also started to introduce 2D and 3D elements into both our still and moving images. These concepts are pushing us beyond our photographic work and taking us to a whole new level by allowing us to offer an in-house approach to clients.  In turn, this makes us more competitive and helps produce a stronger overall product. </p>
<p><strong>Why do these kids want my money?</strong></p>
<p>This campaign isn’t to “Get us to NYC for a week” or “Help us make a video once and you’ll never hear from us again”. Much like our work, this campaign is a hybrid. We need to be in NYC in order to live up to our capabilities and standard by producing high quality work. We do not want to accept “almost good enough.”  New York City is the center of fashion industry and we need be immersed in its constantly changing world to fully experience the shifts and to keep up with the trends – as well as set some of our own!  We will never stop learning and improving our skills.  We will consistently produce new and groundbreaking work until we are no longer able….or until 2012…damn Mayans. </p>

<p><strong>And why NYC – do these kids love bagels that much?</strong></p>
<p>NYC is where we need to be to take our work and our business to the next level. The city is home to some of the top agencies, models, stylists, designers, magazines, studios, locations and more. Being isolated in a smaller city puts limitations on our work because we are lacking the resources and key components that are crucial in maintaining cutting edge and innovative creations. Relocating to New York will provide us the opportunity to work with high-end agencies and creative teams, thereby enhancing the quality of our work. We will also be able to build relationships and start accumulating a clientele. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where’s my money going?</strong></p>
<p>While we have worked hard to save money here in Rochester, it requires significant resources to make a solid go in NYC.  The equipment that we need to purchase in order to do our work is extremely costly, but also a necessity.  We need new lenses, computers (as ours cannot handle or keep up with the video or 3D work we are producing) and some studio equipment. We require video equipment including; audio gear, rigs, a new camera and lighting kit. Additionally, some of the funds will go toward promotion, marketing, advertising and a portfolio book to send to agencies and potential clients. Lastly, your funds would go towards what we need to cover the cost of shoots such as; studio rental fees, set design and materials and any other production fees.</p>
<p>We are full of creativity and passion and we may never again get the chance to pursue our dream with such youth and integrity. By contributing to this project, you are helping us achieve our lifelong dream of fashion photography in the most exciting city on the planet!</p>

We are also limiting the number of perks of available to ensure that every person that orders, gets their shipment ASAP. </p><p>Selecting your size/color:</p><p>Once you have selected and paid for your perk, you will receive a survey link from us that will allow you to make your final selections around size, color and confirm shipping information. Please respond to this survey as it is the only way we know what to send you. Surveys will be sent every Wednesday. </p><p>Sizing:<br/>The other biggest potential challenge comes down to sizing and ensuring our customers select the right size. Having shipped over 70,000 bras, we have seen that over 90% of the time the size is right, and about 10% of the time we need to process an exchange. If you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, we want to make it right. Simply let us know what happened and we will happily exchange the bra for a different size, free of charge.</p><p>The truth about the bra is that it gets better with wear and moulds to your body.

The world's most comfortable, versatile and technologically advanced bra. The Evolution Bra is back and it is better than ever! With over 70,000 bras shipped to-date we are thrilled to be back in stock. These are going to sell out fast and so we are limiting the number of perks available. Place your order and keep an eye out for our survey email. We ship Indiegogo orders weekly. Available Colors:Leah is a 34D and wears our size 4Sarah is a 38D and wears our size 5Kris is a 34B and wears our size 2Our StoryWe’ve reinvented the bra, and designed it with the active woman in mind. With eight wearable options in one, the evolution bra was designed to adapt to the rigors of your busiest days, seamlessly transitioning between work, play, and whatever else you’re up to. Using the latest in performance fabric technology and patented bonded construction that moulds to your unique shape, we have created the most comfortable bra that you will love to wear. The only problem? You might never want to take it off. We wear tested the bra on over 200 women of all different ages and cup sizes to create the sizing chart below. We are also happy to provide online fit consultations to make sure you pick your perfect size. The evolution bra's patented design moulds to your unique shape making it better, wear after wear. To see the bra on women of all different sizes click here. (1 inch = A, 2 inch = B, 3 inch = C, 4 inch = D, 5 inch = DD, 6 inch = DDD/E)Our Story: Knix Wear is an active intimates brand born from listening - to what women want, what they like and what they need - and that women everywhere were being underserved by their underwear. We wanted to create an intimate apparel brand that was designed by women for women. For us, the difference is in the details, that’s why we’ve scoured the globe to find the best possible fabrics and finishes, had hundreds of women wear test our products to get the fit just right and spent two years developing our proprietary technology.Our Mission: Knix Wear merges performance, technology and design to knix the bad and make the good better. We are driven by the belief that active can be attractive, comfortable can be cute, and functional can be fashionable. Our mission is simple: to create the best active intimates on the planet that empowers you to do more of what you love.  Testing:At this point we have shipped over 70,000 bras to women from all over the world. In April we paused production on the product to make a few small modifications that would improve the reversibility of the bra as well as to make changes to our size 1 (making the cup smaller) and size 3 (making the band bigger).We began shipping in January and our bras have been put through rigours of daily life from women all over the world.  From yoga, pilates, hiking, treking, cycling, riding, surfing, swimming, sleeping and working this bra has been up to the task - keeping you fresh, dry, comfortable and confident. Every bra worn has led to product we present you with today that we feel confident you will love.   Underwear:We offer our award winning performance underwear online at www.knixwear.com, available in a variety of colours, fabrics and sizes (XS-2XL) and with your choice of gusset technology (leak proof or moisture wicking). To help prevent stock outs we are not selling underwear as part of this campaign. Special thanks:Maderas Village and the amazing women that work there for hosting our photoshoot and to @loosecannon @nikkodetranquilli @nikkibrand and @reallykindofamazing for the photosThe 200+ women that leant us their time, feedback and their busts to help create this bra - we cannot thank you enough!Attest Media for the video production  Risks and challengesRunning out of stock:Our biggest risk for this campaign is running out of stock which leads to unhappy customers and us letting you down. We don't want this to happen. We are only taking orders again because we have product shipments arriving every month. We are also limiting the number of perks of available to ensure that every person that orders, gets their shipment ASAP. Selecting your size/color:Once you have selected and paid for your perk, you will receive a survey link from us that will allow you to make your final selections around size, color and confirm shipping information. Please respond to this survey as it is the only way we know what to send you. Surveys will be sent every Wednesday. Sizing:The other biggest potential challenge comes down to sizing and ensuring our customers select the right size. Having shipped over 70,000 bras, we have seen that over 90% of the time the size is right, and about 10% of the time we need to process an exchange. If you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason, we want to make it right. Simply let us know what happened and we will happily exchange the bra for a different size, free of charge.The truth about the bra is that it gets better with wear and moulds to your body. If you are unsure about sizing please contact us at indiegogo@knixwear.com include your two measurements and the bra size you typically wear along with the brand and we will be happy to help. Exchanges:We really want you to be happy, and that includes getting you in the right size.

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are JP and Terry, a trained sculptor and fine artist, and a production expert and have been involved in design and production for many years. We are both Irish, Terry is based in Shanghai and is focused on materials, production and quality and JP in Dublin where he focuses on design.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Smyth &amp; Browne was born in the summer of 2012 in Dublin. We decided to design our first collection in 2013 for S/S 2014 and design with simplicity, quality and accessibility in mind, clothes for every man. We aim to make clothes and accessories that will be wardrobe staples for years to come and to promote Irish design and culture, moving away from the typical stereotypes.</p>
<p>The Smyth and Browne names are our mother's maiden names and are used as an homage to them. Much of the design is inspired by Irish and ancient Celtic motifs and patterns, but updated for the modern age.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/88422/files/20130921183843-S_B-Editorial_6403.jpg?1379813923"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>We are undeniably Irish in spirit: urbane, timeless and well-worn.  It’s our belief that simplicity, functionality and quality are what matters today. Each of our exclusive products have been designed and developed by the founders themselves, both born and bred Irishmen; a fact that lends itself to the strong masculine aesthetic seen throughout the range. </p>
<p>Seamlessly blending chic thoughtfully-cut lines that draw from a blend of the history of former days and the breakneck modernity of today, we offer contemporary apparel and accessories for men that are leaders, not followers, men like you.</p>
<p>At Smyth &amp; Browne we offer durable and luxurious tees, polos, high quality leather goods, bags and accessories. </p>
<p>The Smyth &amp; Browne man would expect nothing less, and doesn’t listen to those who follow the crowd, and neither do we.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/88432/files/20130921184756-Smyth_and_Browne_dry_bag_17.jpg?1379814476"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We're now working on the 2014 Winter collection that will feature flat caps and scarves, and gloves made in traditional mills in Ireland, using Irish wool and tweeds. We will also be introducing a line of jewellery using reclaimed metals and leathers. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/88406/files/20130921181248-S_B-Catalogue_6775.jpg?1379812368"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Let Us Break it Down For You Folks. </p>
<p>We want to expand the business and get to the next level so we can make even more exciting products and promote Irish design further. To do this we need  $20000 to help us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A large portion of the pledges will go toward in-depth research and purchase of materials and fabrics, tweeds, wools, for our 2014 winter line from mills in Ireland.</p>
<p>Next, we will upgrade our space In Shanghai from an apartment to a real concept workspace where we can show our process and make samples. A space designers and craftsmen can work together. This will include an investment in worktables, the purchase of a pattern printer, digital printer and new sewing machines in both Shanghai and Ireland- we have to outsource a lot of processes at the moment that we want to move in house.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll be adding more craftsmen to the team to help us ensure quality.</p>

We have many of the perks in stock now and will send them out after the project funding period is complete, please bear with us as we have to put a date, many we will send out earlier.</p>

<p>Terry &amp; JP</p></span></span></span></span></div>","Who Are We?


We are JP and Terry, a trained sculptor and fine artist, and a production expert and have been involved in design and production for many years. We are both Irish, Terry is based in Shanghai and is focused on materials, production and quality and JP in Dublin where he focuses on design.

Smyth & Browne was born in the summer of 2012 in Dublin. We decided to design our first collection in 2013 for S/S 2014 and design with simplicity, quality and accessibility in mind, clothes for every man. We aim to make clothes and accessories that will be wardrobe staples for years to come and to promote Irish design and culture, moving away from the typical stereotypes.
The Smyth and Browne names are our mother's maiden names and are used as an homage to them. Much of the design is inspired by Irish and ancient Celtic motifs and patterns, but updated for the modern age.



We are undeniably Irish in spirit: urbane, timeless and well-worn.  It’s our belief that simplicity, functionality and quality are what matters today. Each of our exclusive products have been designed and developed by the founders themselves, both born and bred Irishmen; a fact that lends itself to the strong masculine aesthetic seen throughout the range. 
Seamlessly blending chic thoughtfully-cut lines that draw from a blend of the history of former days and the breakneck modernity of today, we offer contemporary apparel and accessories for men that are leaders, not followers, men like you.
At Smyth & Browne we offer durable and luxurious tees, polos, high quality leather goods, bags and accessories. 
The Smyth & Browne man would expect nothing less, and doesn’t listen to those who follow the crowd, and neither do we.  



We're now working on the 2014 Winter collection that will feature flat caps and scarves, and gloves made in traditional mills in Ireland, using Irish wool and tweeds. We will also be introducing a line of jewellery using reclaimed metals and leathers. 



What We Need
Let Us Break it Down For You Folks. 
We want to expand the business and get to the next level so we can make even more exciting products and promote Irish design further. To do this we need  $20000 to help us.

A large portion of the pledges will go toward in-depth research and purchase of materials and fabrics, tweeds, wools, for our 2014 winter line from mills in Ireland.
Next, we will upgrade our space In Shanghai from an apartment to a real concept workspace where we can show our process and make samples. A space designers and craftsmen can work together. This will include an investment in worktables, the purchase of a pattern printer, digital printer and new sewing machines in both Shanghai and Ireland- we have to outsource a lot of processes at the moment that we want to move in house.
Finally, we'll be adding more craftsmen to the team to help us ensure quality.



& What You Get
We know nothing is for free and we want to reward you for helping us.

We have lots of great perks that we know you'll love, from lapel pins, tees and polos, to some of our gorgeous bags and hoodies. All, of course dependent on the amount you fantastic people pledge. We have many of the perks in stock now and will send them out after the project funding period is complete, please bear with us as we have to put a date, many we will send out earlier.



If we reach our funding goal this will go a long way to promoting Irish culture and design, away from the usual stereotypes, and also allow us to continue producing excellent, functional and of course great looking menswear and accessories.





Why You Should Back Us:

You believe clothing should fit any man, and no-one should be excluded due to their size
You believe simplicity, functionality and quality are what matters today
You support Irish design and the advancement of modern Irish culture
You want to see what Smyth & Browne will do next with modern Irish clothing and accessories (we've got some big plans)
You can help us even further and support us by sharing our story with your friends, family, colleagues and the world!

<p><br/>Das ist unsere Grundhaltung, ganz gemäß des eigentlichen Gedankens des Bauhaus, an dem wir uns somit nicht nur gestalterisch orientieren. Denn wir von Sternglas bilden einen Gegenpol zu den Global-Playern und jungen Designmarken. Wir halten nichts von editorialen Inzenierungen oder einer künstlichen Exklusivierung. Vielmehr verstehen wir uns als eine demokratische Marke und grenzen niemanden durch eine elitäre Haltung aus. </p>
<p><i>This is our leading mindset, true to the Bauhaus philosophy. We as Sternglas state an opposite pole to the global players and design brands.

<p><br/>Etwas mehr als zwei Jahre sind vergangen, seitdem wir unser erstes Modell über die Crowdfunding Plattform Kickstarter auf den Markt gebracht haben. Seitdem hat sich vieles bei uns getan. Unsere Modellpalette und vor allem unser engagiertes Team hat sich stark vergrößert.</p>
<p>Nun ist es an der Zeit ein neues Projekt über Crowdfunding zu realisieren. Nach Monaten der Planung und jeder Menge kleinteiliger Veränderungen – zum Teil wieder verworfen, zum Teil weiter verfeinert – nimmt die Naos Automatik Gestalt an! Hinter jedem neuen Modell stecken unzählige Stunden Planung und Kommunikation. Der gelungene erste Prototyp entschädigt für die Strapazen.</p>
<p><i>A little more than two years ago, we launched our first model via Kickstarter. A lot has happened since then! Both our model range as well as our committed team has grown.</i></p>
<p><i>Now, two years later, it's time to start a new project via a crowdfunding platform. After months of planning and a lot of small changes again and again, the Naos Automatik is starting to take its shape. Behind every new model are endless hours of planning and communicating. However, the successful prototype makes up for all the strains.</i><br/> </p>

[15.03.2019]Based on your impressive feedback and the achievement of the extended funding goals, we are able to realise the following changes for all the campaign backers. The free strap is for all who supported our project during the financing period.

 

 
 
Das Modell Naos ist unsere Interpretation einer klassischen Dresswatch - und durch die sternförmige Anordnung der Indizes dennoch etwas Besonderes. Wie kein anderes Modell verkörpert es die Grundprinzipien der Marke Sternglas. Höchster Anspruch ohne viel Schnickschnack. Ehrlich, sachlich und auf den Punkt.
The model Naos is our very own interpretation of a classic dress watch - and yet everything but ordinary with its star-shaped arrangement of the indices. Like no other model it exactly embodies our core principles. The highest standards without any unnecessary embellishments. Honest, functional and to the point.
 

 
Neben einem klassischen Weiß (Zeiger: schwarz) ist die NAOS Automatik auch in einem edlen Schwarz (Zeiger: silberfarben) erhältlich. Um Deinen Zeitmesser passend zu ergänzen, hast Du die Wahl zwischen einer Auswahl samtweicher Kalbslederbänder – made in Germany – oder einem feinmaschigen Metallarmband im Milanaise-Stil. Dank Schnellwechselsystem kannst Du Dein Armband zudem mühelos und ohne Werkzeug wechseln. Ganz wonach Dir gerade ist.
The NAOS Automatik is available with a dial in a classic white tone (hands: black) or a noble black (hands: silver). Furthermore, you can choose between a super soft calf leather strap - made in Germany - or a fine, stainless steel milanese strap. The little extra: We equipped all our straps with our quick-release mechanism, so you can exchange your straps hassle-free and whatever you feel like.
 


 

 

 
 

Das ist unsere Grundhaltung, ganz gemäß des eigentlichen Gedankens des Bauhaus, an dem wir uns somit nicht nur gestalterisch orientieren. Denn wir von Sternglas bilden einen Gegenpol zu den Global-Playern und jungen Designmarken. Wir halten nichts von editorialen Inzenierungen oder einer künstlichen Exklusivierung. Vielmehr verstehen wir uns als eine demokratische Marke und grenzen niemanden durch eine elitäre Haltung aus. 
This is our leading mindset, true to the Bauhaus philosophy. We as Sternglas state an opposite pole to the global players and design brands. We don't fancy an editorial staging, neither a created exclusiveness. We rather see ourselves as a democratic brand and do not exclude anyone with an elitist approach.
