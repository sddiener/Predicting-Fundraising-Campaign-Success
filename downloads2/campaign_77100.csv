<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Callie Johnson, the founder and owner of Made With Love Bakery. Baking has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It has always been a way for me to show love to others, hence the name ""Made With Love."" When I bake something I put care and intentionality into every step of the process.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Earliest Picture of Myself Baking</p>
<p>Creating a space where others feel loved and welcome has been a dream of mine since the sixth grade.

<p><b>Why can’t I just drink beer straight from the bottle or can?</b></p>
<p>We believe beer is liquid art which deserves to be respected and consumed the way Brew-masters intended. Just as one would never drink wine or spirits straight from the bottle, it’s highly recommended to pour beer into proper glassware to release its full potential and maximize aroma and flavor.</p>
<p><b>Can’t I just simply pour my beer into a glass to generate foam?</b></p>
<p>Yes and No.  A hand pour provides mechanical agitation that will create foam of randomly packed bubbles of non-uniform shapes that will occupy more space thus are inherently less dense and frothy.  However, only Fizzics eliminates unsightly, bloated bubbles which contribute to foam collapse.  Our device packs small, dense bubbles to preserve the hoppy flavor in beer while providing a wonderful mouthfeel of creamy wet foam.</p>
<p><b>Why is foam important?</b></p>
<p>Foam is an integral part of beer quality and overall drinking experience.  It’s visually appealing, enhances aroma, flavor and mouthfeel of beer and is expected by all serious beer drinkers.</p>
<p><b>How does Fizzics compare to other draft beer dispensers or kegerators?</b></p>
<p>Most all beer system is powered by a set of equipment (keg, faucet handle, tower, regulator, beer &amp; air lines, CO2 and nitrogen tanks) that must work together for a successful pour.  Fizzics is a compact, personal system that utilizes the inherent properties of conditioned and commercially packaged beer coupled with our technology to control the pressure of CO2 wanting to come out of solution and influence foam generation and beer head retention. </p>
<p><b>Can I use any bottle or cans?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  Fizzics serves a vast universe of macro and craft beers and is compatible with all standard size glass bottles including most “Bombers” (22-oz bottle package format) and cans from 16-oz “Tall Boys” to 32-oz “Man Cans.”</p>
<p><b>Can Fizzics be used with other carbonated beverages besides beer?</b></p>
<p>Our system is optimized for beer</p>
<p><b>How do you clean Fizzics?</b></p>
<p>Cleaning Fizzics is very easy.  Run a glass of water or fill an empty, clean can or bottle with water to flush any excess beer residue.  The lid can be removed to easily clean the inside of the canister.  The anti-microbial drip matt and hose separates for easily rinsing and washing. Please check our TubeTube channel for a technical video with cleaning information.</p>
<p><b>What type of beverages are compatible with Fizzics?</b></p>
<p>Fizzics is compatible with all standard-sized beer cans and beer bottles and requires no expensive consumable or proprietary keg or accessories. Whether it's an IPA, Hefeweizen, Pilsner, Brown Ale, or any other popular brew - Fizzics will pour it perfectly.</p>

<p><br/><b><b>Should my glass be cold?</b></b></p>
<p>While the can or bottle of beer you insert should always be cold - the glass is up to you. We always recommend a freshly water-rinsed beer mug or glass - but for flavor sake, please don't freeze or frost your glass.</p>
<p><b><b><b>What kind of batteries does the Fizzics use?</b></b></b></p>
<p>Fizzics is powered by 4 standard AA batteries.</p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Does Fizzics come in different colors?</b></b></b></b></p>
<p>At this time, there is only one color available for the Fizzics beer system, but we will explore other options in the future.<br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">What's special about a beer poured from Fizzics?</b></p>
<p>Fizzics provides an enhanced aroma, flavor and taste as well as a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Scientifically engineered using patent-pending fluid &amp; gas technology to create an ultra-dense, long-lasting foam head.

​
CLICK HERE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT WAYTAP
 
 

 
Fizzics is changing the way people drink beer at home and on the go. 
Meet Fizzics, the world’s first and only universal beer dispenser that delivers an awesome fresh from the tap experience from any can, bottle or growler.

Fizzics Founder and CEO Phil Petracca talks about how The Fizzics System improves the flavor and taste of beer on FOX News.
http://video.foxnews.com/v/4621946046001/the-fizzics-of-making-beer-taste-better/?#sp=show-clips
 

Check out FIZZICS ON BeTerrific.com:

 

 
 
 
 
  
 
Fizzics is a revolutionary beer system curating a draft quality experience straight from any store-bought, off the shelf beer. 

No longer are expertly poured, quality draft beer experiences exclusive to the high end craft beer bars.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 

CLICK HERE to learn more.  
  It is compatible with all standard size glass bottles including most “Bombers” (22-oz bottle package format) and cans from 16-oz “Tall Boys” to 32-oz “Man Cans"" or the Fizzics 64oz growlers.    
 Fizzics applies science & technology to stimulate your 5 senses, beyond what store bought is capable of.
 

 

You know from personal experience, a good draft beer just tastes better! 


We are about to show you the science of how and why Fizzics does what it does and why it is better than your normal draft.
With Fizzics, you'll be a beer sommelier in no time.
 

 

Brewers spend a lot of time and effort to ensure that their beer froths, foams, bubbles, effervesces, sparkles or fizzes in an appealing manner.
 
Bubbles and fizz are essential because:

  

Fizzics controls pressure flow, fluid and gas dynamics to create a rich, creamy foam (head) that enhances the appearance, texture, smoothness and mouthfeel.


 



Fizzics underlies the different phases of fizz: 
Nucleation (bubble starts to form), Beading (bubbles rise to form a head), Disproportionation (bubbles mature).
 

 




 


Beading is the constant replenishment of foam through gas breakout or simply the process of when bubbles rise to form head.
 


 


Ostwald ripening is a phenomenon of adjacent bubbles at different pressures passing from small bubble (higher pressure) to large bubble (lower pressure).
 

 


As beer drains from the foam, the walls of the bubbles start to touch and then merge (coalesce) to produce larger, more unstable bubbles.
 

 
 

This is truly a scientific revolution for the modern beer drinker.
 

 
Never settle for drinking the same beer from a giant size keg or limit your beer options again.  Choose from thousands of macro or craft brews from your local beer retailer, bar or brewer.
 

 
Fizzics is the first beer dispensing system that provides complete control over every single step of enjoying your favorite brew.

Choose your favorite beer variety to fine-tuning the exact level of foam to top off your masterpiece to recreate the draught quality and fine craftsmanship that you previously enjoyed from your favorite bartender’s pour.
 

No over-pour, spillage or wasted beer again.  

Anti-microbial drip matt and system canister separates from dispensing manifold for easy rinsing and washing. 
 

You can enjoy fresh draft quality beer in seconds with just the pull of a tap.

  

Brings the simple pleasure of serving and enjoying draught quality beer as easy as opening/closing a lid and pulling/pushing a tap handle.
 
 

All resins are FDA approved food-grade materials and assembled using stainless steel hardware. Designed to comply with FDA, FCC, CE and RoHS standards. 
All components are manufactured, assembled and packaged in a positive pressure Class 100 Clean Room environment and regularly subjected to rigorous testing to meet the stringent requirements of the FDA.
  

One of a kind beer appliance and “premiumization” system for any style beer. 

One system serving vast macro beer and craft ecosystem to help beer lovers discover the magic behind every variety of beer. 
Concentration of aromatics, body and texture with all your favorite brews, including IPAs, Hefeweizens, Pilsners, Brown Ales and more.
 
 

 
 
 



 
We’ve drawn on a combined 60 years of commercializing new technologies; leveraging our mechanical engineering, product-design and consumer electronic experience to design a one of kind appliance that we believe will innovate, inspire, and invigorate the craft beer industry.

Why can’t I just drink beer straight from the bottle or can?
We believe beer is liquid art which deserves to be respected and consumed the way Brew-masters intended. Just as one would never drink wine or spirits straight from the bottle, it’s highly recommended to pour beer into proper glassware to release its full potential and maximize aroma and flavor.
Can’t I just simply pour my beer into a glass to generate foam?
Yes and No.  A hand pour provides mechanical agitation that will create foam of randomly packed bubbles of non-uniform shapes that will occupy more space thus are inherently less dense and frothy.  However, only Fizzics eliminates unsightly, bloated bubbles which contribute to foam collapse.  Our device packs small, dense bubbles to preserve the hoppy flavor in beer while providing a wonderful mouthfeel of creamy wet foam.
Why is foam important?
Foam is an integral part of beer quality and overall drinking experience.  It’s visually appealing, enhances aroma, flavor and mouthfeel of beer and is expected by all serious beer drinkers.
How does Fizzics compare to other draft beer dispensers or kegerators?
Most all beer system is powered by a set of equipment (keg, faucet handle, tower, regulator, beer & air lines, CO2 and nitrogen tanks) that must work together for a successful pour.  Fizzics is a compact, personal system that utilizes the inherent properties of conditioned and commercially packaged beer coupled with our technology to control the pressure of CO2 wanting to come out of solution and influence foam generation and beer head retention.

<p>This is not my concern. The possibility exists, of course, which is abused my project exactly it. Nevertheless, so far I have been able to precisely counter these claims.

<div>Und auf Deutsch: </div>
<div>Mein Name ist Jörg Siegwarth. Ich bin gelernter Krankenpfleger und Fotograf. Meine langjährige Tätigkeit als KP in einer Akutpsychiatrischen Klinik und der rege Austausch mit Kollegen hat mich zu diesem Projekt gebracht.</div>
<div>Mein Projekt soll Pflege aus der Anonymität holen. Pflegekräfte sollen ein Gesicht bekommen, der Pflegealltag präsent. Ich erzähle Ihnen eine Geschichte im Pflegealltag.</div>
<div>Helfen Sie mir dieses Projekt, das als Bildband erscheinen soll, zu unterstützen. Pflege ist oder wird Teil eines Jeden werden. Pflege muss öffentlich werden. Pflege muss ein Gesicht bekommen.</div>
<div><b>Neben Porträts von Pflegekräften, wird das Buch Reportagefotos enthalten, die einen Krankenhausalltag so zeigen, wie er ist.  Zusätzlich sind Interviews der Porträtierten zu lesen, wo sie schildern, warum Pflege der richtige Beruf für sie ist.</b></div>
<div>Die ersten 25 Porträts sind bereits gemacht. Die nächste Session ist am 27.8.2015. Ich werde in den nächste Wochen, den Fortschritt regelmäßig updaten, damit Sie den Verlauf fast live mitbekommen.</div>
<div>Auch dürfen Sie mich jederzeit über <b>info@joergsiegwarthphotography.com </b>kontaktieren, wenn Sie Fragen haben. Ich werde alle Fragen beantworten.</div>
<h3>Ich benötige Geld.</h3>
<div>Einen Bildband drucken zu lassen, kostet Geld. Ich benötige Euro 9000,- für den Druck bei einer Auflage von 250 Stk. Das ist das Minimum, um erfolgreich publizieren zu können.</div>
<div>Von der Gesamtauflage werden 50 limitierte Stücke mit jeweils einem Print zusätzlich versehen und persönlich von mir mit einer Widmung versehen. Dies ist nur einer der Perks, die ich Ihnen anbiete. </div>
<div>Das Highlight wird aber sicherlich ein Fotoshooting sein, dass ich Ihnen anbieten werde.</div>
<div>Sollte ich das Fundingziel übertreffen, kann es eine höhere Auflage geben, um noch mehr Menschen erreichen zu können.</div>
<div><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b>Machen Sie Pflege öffentlich!</b></span></div>
</div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Pflege bekommt ein </span>Gesicht<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> ist ein </span>Projekt von Menschen für Menschen. Pflege geht uns alle an. Pflege ist essentiell und lebensnotwendig geworden. Menschen, die professionell wissen, was zu tun ist, wenn der Laie nicht weiter weiß. Dies alles ist zwar in den Medien politisch kontrovers diskutiert, auf einer gesellschaftlichen, menschlichen Basis ist es jedoch wenig präsent. <span><br/></span>
</div><div>Politische Entscheidungen können wir aktiv nur in einem extrem eingeschränkten Maße beeinflussen: Gesellschaftliche Akzeptanz und ein in Not geratener Berufszweig wie die Pflege können wir aber innerhalb der Bevölkerung erreichen. Wir, die Menschen sind es, die das Bestimmen und Lenken, unabhängig von der Politik. Menschlichkeit zu zeigen, Werbung für diesen Beruf zu machen und ein Gesicht zu zeigen, welches Pflege verdient, das ist mein Anliegen. Helfen Sie mir, diesen kleinen Beitrag in die Öffentlichkeit zu tragen. </div><div>Natürlich gibt es die Pflegekräfte, die demonstrieren, sich gern aufregen, fordern. </div><div>Dies ist nicht mein Anliegen. Die Möglichkeit besteht natürlich, das mein Projekt genau dafür missbraucht wird. Dennoch, bislang habe ich genau diesen Forderungen kontern können.

All this is indeed discussed politically controversial in the media on a social, human-based but it is a big presence.
Political decisions we can influence only in an extremely limited extent Active: Social acceptance and in distress profession like nursing, but we can achieve within the population. We the people are the ones who. Determining and directing, regardless of the policy To show humanity to advertise for this profession and to show a face, which deserves care that is my concern. Help me to carry this small contribution to the public.
Of course there are the nurses who demonstrate gladly upset, ask.
This is not my concern. The possibility exists, of course, which is abused my project exactly it. Nevertheless, so far I have been able to precisely counter these claims. It is an independent project which is solely controlled by me. I understand it as an assessment of care. It is not a protest. My belief is that just as food for thought can be given. Only in this way it is possible to support care (below).
I am grateful for every contribution.
Each contribution is extremely important. Not only money, but also the language. Talk to your fellow man, you tell others. Share. The idea in social media Any support will bring us one step further.

Und auf Deutsch: 
Mein Name ist Jörg Siegwarth. Ich bin gelernter Krankenpfleger und Fotograf. Meine langjährige Tätigkeit als KP in einer Akutpsychiatrischen Klinik und der rege Austausch mit Kollegen hat mich zu diesem Projekt gebracht.
Mein Projekt soll Pflege aus der Anonymität holen. Pflegekräfte sollen ein Gesicht bekommen, der Pflegealltag präsent. Ich erzähle Ihnen eine Geschichte im Pflegealltag.
Helfen Sie mir dieses Projekt, das als Bildband erscheinen soll, zu unterstützen. Pflege ist oder wird Teil eines Jeden werden. Pflege muss öffentlich werden. Pflege muss ein Gesicht bekommen.
Neben Porträts von Pflegekräften, wird das Buch Reportagefotos enthalten, die einen Krankenhausalltag so zeigen, wie er ist.  Zusätzlich sind Interviews der Porträtierten zu lesen, wo sie schildern, warum Pflege der richtige Beruf für sie ist.
Die ersten 25 Porträts sind bereits gemacht. Die nächste Session ist am 27.8.2015. Ich werde in den nächste Wochen, den Fortschritt regelmäßig updaten, damit Sie den Verlauf fast live mitbekommen.
Auch dürfen Sie mich jederzeit über info@joergsiegwarthphotography.com kontaktieren, wenn Sie Fragen haben. Ich werde alle Fragen beantworten.
Ich benötige Geld.
Einen Bildband drucken zu lassen, kostet Geld. Ich benötige Euro 9000,- für den Druck bei einer Auflage von 250 Stk. Das ist das Minimum, um erfolgreich publizieren zu können.
Von der Gesamtauflage werden 50 limitierte Stücke mit jeweils einem Print zusätzlich versehen und persönlich von mir mit einer Widmung versehen. Dies ist nur einer der Perks, die ich Ihnen anbiete. 
Das Highlight wird aber sicherlich ein Fotoshooting sein, dass ich Ihnen anbieten werde.
Sollte ich das Fundingziel übertreffen, kann es eine höhere Auflage geben, um noch mehr Menschen erreichen zu können.
Machen Sie Pflege öffentlich!

Pflege bekommt ein Gesicht ist ein Projekt von Menschen für Menschen. Pflege geht uns alle an. Pflege ist essentiell und lebensnotwendig geworden. Menschen, die professionell wissen, was zu tun ist, wenn der Laie nicht weiter weiß. Dies alles ist zwar in den Medien politisch kontrovers diskutiert, auf einer gesellschaftlichen, menschlichen Basis ist es jedoch wenig präsent. 
Politische Entscheidungen können wir aktiv nur in einem extrem eingeschränkten Maße beeinflussen: Gesellschaftliche Akzeptanz und ein in Not geratener Berufszweig wie die Pflege können wir aber innerhalb der Bevölkerung erreichen. Wir, die Menschen sind es, die das Bestimmen und Lenken, unabhängig von der Politik. Menschlichkeit zu zeigen, Werbung für diesen Beruf zu machen und ein Gesicht zu zeigen, welches Pflege verdient, das ist mein Anliegen. Helfen Sie mir, diesen kleinen Beitrag in die Öffentlichkeit zu tragen. Natürlich gibt es die Pflegekräfte, die demonstrieren, sich gern aufregen, fordern. Dies ist nicht mein Anliegen. Die Möglichkeit besteht natürlich, das mein Projekt genau dafür missbraucht wird. Dennoch, bislang habe ich genau diesen Forderungen kontern können. Es ist ein unabhängiges Projekt, das ausschließlich von mir gesteuert wird. Ich begreife es, als eine Würdigung von Pflege. Es ist kein Protest. Meine Überzeugung ist, dass nur so ein Denkanstoß gegeben werden kann. Nur so ist es möglich, Pflege zu (unter)stützen.
    Ich bin für jeden Beitrag dankbar.
    
Jeder Beitrag ist enorm wichtig. Nicht nur Geld, sondern auch die Sprache. Sprechen Sie Ihre Mitmenschen an, sagen Sie es weiter. Teilen Sie die Idee in den sozialen Medien. Jede Unterstützung bringt uns einen Schritt weiter.Sie finden uns unter www.facebook.com/pflegebekommteingesicht

<b>We really want to get get our non-profit, Pavilion Integrative Health Insurance program started!  </b> $16,000 will go to begin the necessary legal filings and groundwork to set this up. The Affordable Care Act has a provision that allows for the establishment of new health insurance companies -- as long as they are not-for-profit and consumer centric, and have a consumer board.  That's fine by me.  I mean... shouldn't insurance companies <i>be </i>consumer focused? Pavilion Board Member Dr. Mark McClure and I -- Dr. McClure founded a dental insurance plan called DentiCare and was President of Capital Integrative Health University in Washington -- are working to roll out a better brand of health insurance even before Pavilions are built. Eventually we'll create a network of top, integrative care providers whose focus is to keep you healthy. And our insurance company will work closely with our nonprofit Pavilion Life Sciences Center (see #2) and the Academy of Comprehensive Integrative Medicine to get you the best SELF HEALTH information out there to keep you in top shape.  [Speaking of Self Health, did you know that about 85% of the health issues experienced by most people can safely and effectively be taken care of without needing to visit a doctor or healthcare provider?]   <br/>

<h3>Why Me? </h3>
<b>Because when I developed asthma a number of
years back and my doctor said I would need inhalers and medication for the rest
of my life... I told him that wasn't acceptable.</b>  Over time, I cured myself of asthma ... and later high blood pressure, joint pain, and a few other things, so I have plenty of firsthand experience to share.  I also produced hundreds of educational programs and courses on health related issues -- for clients in both conventional medicine and complementary medicine. Other good 'why me' reasons include I've run large restaurants, hospital food service, worked with a resort hotel, graduated from Cornell's Hotel School (which teaches this stuff), raised kids, WAS a kid &lt;LOL&gt; and more -- which you can read about on<b> <a href=""http://pavilionclub.us/documents/GrapekBioforPavilionWebsite-ArtisticFinal_001.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my BIO</a>.  </b><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>There should not be any substantial setbacks or issues,
at least not with regard to fulfillment. 
We already have most of the items to send out.  However, with regard to teleconferences,
calls, meetings, webinars and things having to do with 'live' people, there is always
the possibility that something could happen which could prevent a person from
fulfilling their obligation.  In
such a case we will do our best to find a close match -- to fulfill our commitment
to you.  </p>
<p>As far as risks and challenges with actually getting The Pavilion,
or any sizable enterprise up and running, there are, of course, plenty.  These are addressed in our business
plan.  Of course, to mitigate these risks, we have on board some of the
best professionals our there in their respective fields… and a market, and <i>zeitgeist</i>,
that's in alignment with, and waiting for, the evolutionary lifestyle and
solutions The Pavilion will bring forward. </p>
<p>Thank you again your consideration.  Your support -- even just sharing our links and raising awareness about our campaign -- sends a strong
message to all of us, and potential investors, philanthropists-donors, sponsors, and partners,
that the time is right for The Pavilion…
and for everyone to enjoy healthier, richer, lives and a better future.  </p>

they are sure to spark an evolution in better living.  To
paraphrase Nelson Mandela, 'Education is the most powerful tool which you can
use to change the world'.  And that.... we will have lots of!

Why Me? 
Because when I developed asthma a number of
years back and my doctor said I would need inhalers and medication for the rest
of my life... I told him that wasn't acceptable.  Over time, I cured myself of asthma ... and later high blood pressure, joint pain, and a few other things, so I have plenty of firsthand experience to share.  I also produced hundreds of educational programs and courses on health related issues -- for clients in both conventional medicine and complementary medicine. Other good 'why me' reasons include I've run large restaurants, hospital food service, worked with a resort hotel, graduated from Cornell's Hotel School (which teaches this stuff), raised kids, WAS a kid <LOL> and more -- which you can read about on my BIO.  
  Risks & Challenges  
There should not be any substantial setbacks or issues,
at least not with regard to fulfillment. 
We already have most of the items to send out.  However, with regard to teleconferences,
calls, meetings, webinars and things having to do with 'live' people, there is always
the possibility that something could happen which could prevent a person from
fulfilling their obligation.  In
such a case we will do our best to find a close match -- to fulfill our commitment
to you.  
As far as risks and challenges with actually getting The Pavilion,
or any sizable enterprise up and running, there are, of course, plenty.  These are addressed in our business
plan.  Of course, to mitigate these risks, we have on board some of the
best professionals our there in their respective fields… and a market, and zeitgeist,
that's in alignment with, and waiting for, the evolutionary lifestyle and
solutions The Pavilion will bring forward. 
Thank you again your consideration.  Your support -- even just sharing our links and raising awareness about our campaign -- sends a strong
message to all of us, and potential investors, philanthropists-donors, sponsors, and partners,
that the time is right for The Pavilion…
and for everyone to enjoy healthier, richer, lives and a better future.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

Cops have guns…we have cameras</b></i></p>
<p>Fund this Camera Equipment campaign to train and equip community members to expose civil rights abuses by the Fargo PD, via #CopCoverage with audio and video recording devices.</p>
<p>The
People’s Press Project (PPP), is a media justice non-profit serving the Fargo, ND
and Moorhead, MN area which has launched a community response to numerous claims of excessive
force by the Fargo Police department.  The
PPP has responded with educational trainings empowering residents with an understanding of their civil, communication and community journalism
rights and best practices. </p>
<p>This project benefits anyone who wants to learn their communication rights, the public's rights to film and record in public, and how to
exercise them, We also aim to help the public share their
stories in the most effective ways. The PPP
will be holding trainings, webinars, and community response actions in
connection with the #CopCoverage campaign empowering residents to
discuss concerns about police interactions, sharing their stories, and seeking remedies together with local law enforcement entities so that together police
and community members can shape the face of community policing in the
Fargo-Moorhead region.</p>
<p>We are seeking $5000 in funding to pay for training and to purchase
video and audio equipment for our non-profit which can be checked-out the public. With this funding we will be able to train and equip over 100 residents with know your rights information and camera and audio equipment to document the police in action.  <br/><br/>The training and equipment will be used to document any abusive or misconduct by the FARGO Police Department. Video and audio will be uploaded to our website and network of media and social media groups in an effort to create accountability with regard to police interactions, practices, polices, and accountability to the public. Funding will be used for training personnel, resources, video and audio
equipment and technical assistance
to promote and document community stories through the Internet, local independent media, social networks, websites and
local news outlets.</p>
<p>The project will disseminate information and

Cops have guns…we have cameras
Fund this Camera Equipment campaign to train and equip community members to expose civil rights abuses by the Fargo PD, via #CopCoverage with audio and video recording devices.
The
People’s Press Project (PPP), is a media justice non-profit serving the Fargo, ND
and Moorhead, MN area which has launched a community response to numerous claims of excessive
force by the Fargo Police department.  The
PPP has responded with educational trainings empowering residents with an understanding of their civil, communication and community journalism
rights and best practices. 
This project benefits anyone who wants to learn their communication rights, the public's rights to film and record in public, and how to
exercise them, We also aim to help the public share their
stories in the most effective ways. The PPP
will be holding trainings, webinars, and community response actions in
connection with the #CopCoverage campaign empowering residents to
discuss concerns about police interactions, sharing their stories, and seeking remedies together with local law enforcement entities so that together police
and community members can shape the face of community policing in the
Fargo-Moorhead region.
We are seeking $5000 in funding to pay for training and to purchase
video and audio equipment for our non-profit which can be checked-out the public. With this funding we will be able to train and equip over 100 residents with know your rights information and camera and audio equipment to document the police in action.  The training and equipment will be used to document any abusive or misconduct by the FARGO Police Department. Video and audio will be uploaded to our website and network of media and social media groups in an effort to create accountability with regard to police interactions, practices, polices, and accountability to the public. Funding will be used for training personnel, resources, video and audio
equipment and technical assistance
to promote and document community stories through the Internet, local independent media, social networks, websites and
local news outlets.
The project will disseminate information and
equipment to document encounters with law enforcement.  This project will also develop a community
coalition to address these issues with the police departments and seek community
based solutions to keep the community safe from police misconduct.Here are some stories that highlight these issues in Fargo, ND:Local News Coverage, WDAY.com:http://youtu.be/JhHo5YKb0YwFreeThoughtProject.com---13 Cops Dispatched to Arrest One 15-year-old Girl, Because a Cop ‘Smelled Weed’Read more:  http://thefreethoughtproject.com/13-cops-dispatched-arrest-15-year-old-girl-cop-smelled-weed/fmppp.org--Excessive Force Claim: 13 officers dispatched to arrest one 15 year old Mexican GirlRead more:  http://thepeoplespressproject.org/cop-coverage/excessive-force-claim-13-officers-dispatched-to-arrest-one-15-year-old-mexican-girlLastRealIndians.com--Excessive Force Claim: 13 officers dispatched to arrest one 15 year old Mexican GirlRead more: http://lastrealindians.com/excessive-force-clai...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/></p>     Looking back on our journey to create The Wish List, I cant help but feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for all that it has given our family. For me personally, it's has been a journey of learning... (to see our story in pictures see the video above.) Since we opened our first shop in Nashville in 2008, I’ve learned so much about what you can accomplish if you work hard and you love what you do. There has been so much joy, bursts of creativity, and struggles too. Being a business owner wasn’t as scary as I thought...it taught me how much you can make a difference in your community, and in the lives of others. I’ve tried to use every opportunity with guests in our shop, or even people passing by, to affect the quality of their day in a positive way. </div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">    <br/>     We moved back to our hometown of Carlsbad, CA in 2010 to aid in the care of my mother who was battling brain cancer. We searched for the perfect “fixer upper” shop space that we could afford, and were blessed with a wonderful location in the village. We had to politely ask a hive of bees to find another home, give the property a lot of TLC, and once again, The Wish List opened it’s doors. Sadly, my mom was never well enough to visit before she passed away that same year. Opening the new Wish List helped me through that time. It kept me busy and surrounded me with amazing people that enjoyed our shop. I’ve learned it’s not as much about the stuff you sell, as it is about the people you connect with. <br/></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">      </span>

<br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">     </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Last November we had to close our Carlsbad shop after the owner of the property made plans to sell it. Since then, my faith in The Wish List has been reaffirmed often by people I see in my community who ask if we are opening in a new location soon. I’ve dreamed of a place where our shop would always be accessible to my friends from Nashville, Carlsbad, and all around the country- even the world - anytime day or night. A place where the doors would never close and visitors can check in, hang out, enjoy the shop, and exchange ideas. I’ve been working hard to prepare an online store and blog, but have exhausted my resources trying to overcome roadblocks along the way. I need your help!</span>

This would help us to get the funding we need to prepare for the launch of The Wish List Vintage Market online by January 2016. Here are some photos of what we are offering:</span></p>

</div></div>","Our Story

     
     

     Looking back on our journey to create The Wish List, I cant help but feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for all that it has given our family. For me personally, it's has been a journey of learning... (to see our story in pictures see the video above.) Since we opened our first shop in Nashville in 2008, I’ve learned so much about what you can accomplish if you work hard and you love what you do. There has been so much joy, bursts of creativity, and struggles too. Being a business owner wasn’t as scary as I thought...it taught me how much you can make a difference in your community, and in the lives of others. I’ve tried to use every opportunity with guests in our shop, or even people passing by, to affect the quality of their day in a positive way. 
         We moved back to our hometown of Carlsbad, CA in 2010 to aid in the care of my mother who was battling brain cancer. We searched for the perfect “fixer upper” shop space that we could afford, and were blessed with a wonderful location in the village. We had to politely ask a hive of bees to find another home, give the property a lot of TLC, and once again, The Wish List opened it’s doors. Sadly, my mom was never well enough to visit before she passed away that same year. Opening the new Wish List helped me through that time. It kept me busy and surrounded me with amazing people that enjoyed our shop. I’ve learned it’s not as much about the stuff you sell, as it is about the people you connect with.       


     Last November we had to close our Carlsbad shop after the owner of the property made plans to sell it. Since then, my faith in The Wish List has been reaffirmed often by people I see in my community who ask if we are opening in a new location soon. I’ve dreamed of a place where our shop would always be accessible to my friends from Nashville, Carlsbad, and all around the country- even the world - anytime day or night. A place where the doors would never close and visitors can check in, hang out, enjoy the shop, and exchange ideas. I’ve been working hard to prepare an online store and blog, but have exhausted my resources trying to overcome roadblocks along the way. I need your help!

      
     When a sweet friend suggested that I start a crowd funding campaign to bring back The Wish List, I realized that many of you may be interested in purchasing groups of creative gifts and products just in time for the holidays! This would help us to get the funding we need to prepare for the launch of The Wish List Vintage Market online by January 2016. Here are some photos of what we are offering:


             
       ( 10 Handmade Greeting Cards)                     ( 3 Architectural Art Prints )
       
               (3 Quote Dictionary Prints)                         (Signed Dictionary Bird Prints) 
                                     
                                (4 Dozen Handmade Holiday Gift Tags $25 Perk)
                                      
               (12 Humorous (and Slightly Inappropriate) Greeting Cards $30 Perk)

Here's what we'll be using these campaign funds for:


Creative-  Design software and hardware. A reliable used Apple computer suitable for design and online store needs (for business use only- sticky hands OFF, kids!),  A versatile new printer that uses ink sparingly and isn't trying to drive me insane with jammed paper and glitches- arrrgh! Enough ink that I won't be going back to Staples every other day. Assorted supplies including bulk blank cards, scrap booking papers, inks, ribbon, glue, scissors, paper cutter, embellishments, etc.  
Packing and Shipping- postal scale, tape, boxes, bubble wrap, packing peanuts, packaging paper, office supplies, Cellophane sleeves, envelopes, mailers, etc.  
Teaching- Supplies for upcoming local painting, art, and craft classes in Carlsbad. Paints, smocks, cleanup supplies, easels, brushes, palettes, canvases, art pencils, glue, assorted craft needs.

<h3>Summary of Project</h3>
<p>We want to help SMEs to increase their competitiveness with collection and analysis of data with application of social listening technology.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>World New Economy Council envisions a world where technological advancement is fair, open, safe and human-centric as a result of strong awareness of continue governance of the happiness values created and developed across organizations.  We are charity organization registered in Hong Kong Special Administration Region (or “HKSAR” from hereafter) since 2012.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Technology Application in Small and Medium Enterprise</h3>
<p>Economy constantly evolves with technological advancements.  Its evolution becomes exponentially faster and larger in scale with the industrialization 4.0 with A.I. </p>
<p>Corporate and Government using technology to elevate productivity might have profit-efficiency .  The Small and Medium Enterprise, on the other hand, do often lack of resources or inadequate allocation of resources or qualified technical talents to develop/upgrade technology to elevate productivity.</p>
<h3>Current Economic Situation in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>For retail chains with significant resources, they are likely to possess financial and technical resources to gather customer feedback for continuous improvement of its services and products.  For retail SMEs, on the contrary, they are far less likely to even possess the knowledge about user feedback gathering, analytics and applications for improvement of its competitiveness.</p>
<p>The above unbalanced situation in technology application might perceived by public as more tolerable when the economic situations are booming and optimistic where retail spending is ample o be shared among most retailers.  In the past twelve months, however, HKSAR has experienced 10% drop in tourist population, all the festive events during the past seven months were cancelled due to various reasons given by the organizers.  Economists foresee –1.3% growth in GDP into 2020, which indicates recession.  Leaders of various retail sectors expects an inevitable closure among 11% of retailers.</p>
<p>It is high time that the Small and Medium retailers by definition those retailers with less than 50 employees be given assistance to increase their competitiveness. Qualified SMEs with fewer than 50 employees and in possession of a valid Business Registration and proper F&amp;B License were able to apply for Li Ka Shing Foundation’s HK$1 billion Crunch Time Instant Relief Fund.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We call for funding to engage market survey companies which applies Social Listening technology to collect timely and direct feedback from the customers of the retail SMEs.</p>
<p>We shall work with this market survey company to gather the required customer feedback and transformed it into data. The data collected from the customers would be analyzed by the Social Listening Market Survey Companies prepare individual reports, comparison reports and industry reports and highlight insight.</p>
<p>The World New Economy Council would be conducting group sharing sessions with the participating SMEs to explain the data summarized in the reports and their implication to their competitiveness.</p>
<p>The World New Economy Council would provide suggestions to increase competitiveness based on the insights created at individual level, competitors level and industry levels.</p>

</p><h2><b>Introducing
Good Night Out</b></h2><b>
</b><p>Launched in London on International Women’s Day March 2014, <b>Good
Night Out</b> is a volunteer-run campaign that works with clubs, bars, pubs and venues, training staff, security and
management on how to deal with and prevent the harassment of women and LGTBQ people on their
premises.  </p><p>Good Night Out was developed in response to the overwhelming amount of stories we received on our Hollaback London website about harassment on nights out (<b>e.g groping, leering, grabbing, sexually aggressive behaviour, stalking, humiliation, and homophobia</b>) where all too often responses from staff and security fell way short of acceptable. </p>
<p>Participating<b> London</b> venues we have worked with so far include <a href=""http://www.fabriclondon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fabric</a>, <a href=""http://www.theoldbluelast.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Old Blue Last</a>, <a href=""http://birthdaysdalston.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Birthdays</a>,

their town needs <b>Good Night Out</b>.  <br/><br/>We need your help to make this happen and roll the campaign out nationwide.<br/></p><p></p><h2>What we'll do</h2><p></p><p></p><p>We plan to roll out <b>Good Night Out</b> as an independent, trusted safety mark for venues, pubs, bars and clubs across the UK and Ireland. It will be coordinated in London by Julia Gray and Bryony Beynon from <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/national-good-night-out-campaign/edit/ldn.ihollaback.org/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollaback London</a>, with regional organisers around the country.</p><p>We’ve developed an efficient volunteer-led framework for delivering the campaign, drawing on a range of individuals,  activist groups, universities, and organisations such as regional Rape Crisis centres in the following areas across the UK and Ireland: <b>Edinburgh, Glasgow, Norwich, Medway Towns in Kent, Oxford, Nottingham, Coventry, Brighton, Bristol, Sheffield, Limerick </b>and <b>Galway</b>, with more signing up all the time. </p><p><b>It will launch over Fresher’s Week, September 2014.</b> <br/></p><p>We've been working closely with <a href=""http://www.nusconnect.org.uk/blogs/blog/SusuanaAntubam/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">NUS Women’s Officer Susuana Antubam</a>,<b> </b>getting involved with the National Lad Culture Strategy to help create, safer and more accessible student communities. </p><h2><b><span>What We
Need </span></b></h2><p><b><span>£5000 </span></b>represents a proportion of one year’s national operation of the <b>Good Night
Out </b>campaign, based on a volunteer-led distributed leadership model.</p>
<p>Your donation
will enable us to run this national programme effectively by covering all or
part of the cost of:</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Professional design and print work</b></li></ul><b>
</b><p>We have worked
pro-bono with graphic designer <b>Heather Weil</b> to develop our popular strongly branded
campaign materials, and your donation will enable us to extend this identity
into bars and clubs across the country</p><p></p><ul><li>
<b>Website</b><br/>
</li></ul><b>
</b><p>We have
negotiated a reduced quote from a trusted developer to produce a <b>fully-featured
website</b> that explains our mission and brings together each regional organiser,
allowing them to display their own content about the participating venues in
their town, their contact email and other multimedia content.</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Training for Organisers</b></li></ul>
We will develop and deliver ‘train the trainer’ modules for our regional
organisers to ensure that training delivered around the country matches the
quality of training we give to our very happy participating venues in London.
<p></p><ul><li><b><b>Administration </b><b>and delivery costs</b></b></li></ul><p><span>For the first time ever, we’ll be aiming to cover a small amount of the
many hours of admin time that goes into making our campaigns work.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<h2><b>The
Impact</b></h2><p>We have found

Good Night Out
Launched in London on International Women’s Day March 2014, Good
Night Out is a volunteer-run campaign that works with clubs, bars, pubs and venues, training staff, security and
management on how to deal with and prevent the harassment of women and LGTBQ people on their
premises.  Good Night Out was developed in response to the overwhelming amount of stories we received on our Hollaback London website about harassment on nights out (e.g groping, leering, grabbing, sexually aggressive behaviour, stalking, humiliation, and homophobia) where all too often responses from staff and security fell way short of acceptable. 
Participating London venues we have worked with so far include fabric, The Old Blue Last, Birthdays,
Village Underground, University of London Union, Dance Tunnel, Dalston Superstore, The Lexington and more.Good Night Out has already been featured in The Guardian (""Sexual harassment is normal in clubs, but are things about to change?"") Evening Standard (""Time to reclaim the streets from London's leches"") and NME (""Groping at gigs must be stamped out"") we've spoken about gender-based harassment on LBC Radio, The Community Channel and on the BBC many times. Each participating venue undergoes a training session from Good Night Out and displays prominently to their patrons a poster pledge that reads: Since our launch, people from across the UK, Ireland and beyond have been contacting us saying how badly
their town needs Good Night Out.  We need your help to make this happen and roll the campaign out nationwide.What we'll doWe plan to roll out Good Night Out as an independent, trusted safety mark for venues, pubs, bars and clubs across the UK and Ireland. It will be coordinated in London by Julia Gray and Bryony Beynon from Hollaback London, with regional organisers around the country.We’ve developed an efficient volunteer-led framework for delivering the campaign, drawing on a range of individuals,  activist groups, universities, and organisations such as regional Rape Crisis centres in the following areas across the UK and Ireland: Edinburgh, Glasgow, Norwich, Medway Towns in Kent, Oxford, Nottingham, Coventry, Brighton, Bristol, Sheffield, Limerick and Galway, with more signing up all the time. It will launch over Fresher’s Week, September 2014. We've been working closely with NUS Women’s Officer Susuana Antubam, getting involved with the National Lad Culture Strategy to help create, safer and more accessible student communities. What We
Need £5000 represents a proportion of one year’s national operation of the Good Night
Out campaign, based on a volunteer-led distributed leadership model.
Your donation
will enable us to run this national programme effectively by covering all or
part of the cost of:Professional design and print work
We have worked
pro-bono with graphic designer Heather Weil to develop our popular strongly branded
campaign materials, and your donation will enable us to extend this identity
into bars and clubs across the country
Website

We have
negotiated a reduced quote from a trusted developer to produce a fully-featured
website that explains our mission and brings together each regional organiser,
allowing them to display their own content about the participating venues in
their town, their contact email and other multimedia content.Training for Organisers
We will develop and deliver ‘train the trainer’ modules for our regional
organisers to ensure that training delivered around the country matches the
quality of training we give to our very happy participating venues in London.
Administration and delivery costsFor the first time ever, we’ll be aiming to cover a small amount of the
many hours of admin time that goes into making our campaigns work.
The
ImpactWe have found
that once venues, pubs, bars and clubs were confronted with the scale of the
problem and given the tools to confront it, real change takes effect. We partnered with fabric to develop their landmark harassment policy in 2012 and have since trained many venues (from small bars to thousand+ capacity venues) around London about keeping women and LGTBQ people safer on nights out, encouraging good responses from staff and changing organisational policy to ensure there is zero tolerance.  The feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive and welcoming. We have directly held venue management accountable in a open, collaborative process of accountability and improvement and we are very confident we can continue this work
across the country.Here are some quotes from industry leaders who have benefitted from our training:“Being part of Good Night Out is soooo important to us as a music space, as
we want everyone to be able to enjoy themselves and feel safe in our venue.
We’ve received some really positive messages from women thanking us for taking
this stance and having their backs since we started publicising the campaign.”

</div> </div> <div> <h3>Starting Up with Appreciation.</h3>
<div>I have created a budget for rent, monthly costs and supplies. The part I really need help with are the start up costs. Start up costs are always more than you think, and you have to be prepared. Having these costs covered, even in part,  will ensure that my launch pad for this business is clear. I've calculated profit margins, inventory costs and have a clear business plan;  the costs associated with first moving into a new space are what I need help with.  I need to set up a debit machine, buy an inexpensive work laptop to do my webdesign and updates on. I need to make some bulk purchases of supplies like tacking, fabric and upholstery foam. I also need to purchase retail necessities like bags for my pillow sales and signage. Part of the start up costs will be allocated to social media and website promotion. These are things that need to be purchased from the start so that I can concentrate on building stock and booking clients. <br/><br/>Whoever decides to contribute to my project funding will be forever in my mind, and I want to show my appreciation. For donations of $50 or over,  I will be hand writing special thank you cards along with a set of handmade paper gift tags for your use. For donations over $100, I will gladly send you a 16 by 16 inch pillow cover in your choice of fabrics I have hand-picked. I want you to have a real 'in your hand' (or on your chair!) token of my appreciation. Those that donate $300 and over I will have their names added to a wall in my studio. Your name will be on a plaque to remind me daily that you helped me make my dream possible. I will also add your name to my website on a special ""thank you"" page.  If posting your name publicly is something you'd rather not have, I'll happily send you a pillow cover, some handmade tags and a handwritten thank you card to show you my immense appreciation. You believed in my vision, and it means the world to me. <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/898329/files/20141002045014-charcoal_LG.jpg?1412250614"" src="""" style=""width: 329.67409948542px; height: 310px;""/>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/898333/files/20141002045119-raccoon_thanks_LG.jpg?1412250679"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 147.790322580645px; height: 187px; background-color: initial;""/></p>

<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Seeing is Believing.</h3>
<div>I have clear goals for my business. I <span style=""background-color: initial;"">have other creative outlets that ensure I am always creating regardless of my list of projects. I sew pillows because I love how easily they transform a room. I love design and especially love the inspiration that can spring from seeing color combinations. I want to vamp up social media and website advertising so that I can successfully sell these items online. I have stores that are interested in commissioning my pillows and paper craft items and I need a studio space to act as a productive hive for stock. Upholstery is my focus, but these other projects ensure that I am always creating and being inspired. It doesn't hurt that they have high profit margins! </span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The upholstery aspect of my work has a few important streams of income. I have been commissioned to do many pieces for people who have fabrics and ideas that they just need someone to carry out. I love working with clients who want their own visions brought to life. Seeing their faces when their project is complete is truly amazing! </span><br/>
</div>
<div>Design revival is another area I enjoy. Buying a piece that needs TLC is as easy as opening Kijiji in your browser. Everything has potential. When you buy a chair that needs redoing, the possibilities are endless. Choosing the fabric and style has got to be the most FUN I'll ever have with my work. Every piece that I've done this with has sold, and sold quickly. I'm good at this!<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Eventually, I want to be able to teach others to do simple upholstery. After a few years in the studio I'll pursue either in-studio classes or online tutorials. Weekend projects for those who want to learn and who are DIYers don't take away from your business if they are paying you for help and guidance! </span><br/>
</div> <p>When I move into my studio and set up all that I need to be successful in my space, I'll be reflecting on how I got here. The inspiration I experience daily will finally be able to flow in a studio atmosphere, and there will be nothing to stop me from achieving my goals. I would absolutely love to have an emailing list of all my funding supporters so that I can update you on progress, achievements and goals.</p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Challenges. </h3> <p>When you have been in business management for as long as I have, the phrase most uttered is, ""expect everything to go wrong"". In the bar industry, it was a daily struggle to keep the beer fridge chugging along or the food from the kitchen to come out at a reasonable time. You've got to be ready for anything. It's a bit different in the design industry, but not much. You might need to deal with unhappy clients once in awhile, or your tools may fail you. These sorts of challenges must be met with the same patience, common sense and problem solving skills, though. Keep your clients happy, your inspiration flowing and your income coming. If you chose to do something, do it full on and do it right. My workmanship and dedication to my clients is my focus.</p>
<p>Business and risk go hand in hand. The sleepless nights before signing a lease aren't different when the business is different. It's both scary and exciting;  you think of the worst case scenarios and you dwell on them. I've done that for a long time. As a solution to worry and risk, I did my research and planning, and when I finished it I realized that I have something great here. I'm ready for all the challenges, risks and fear because I'm prepared for them and I have experience in solving them.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Competition is always a challenge. But one of the beauties of upholstery is the demand for AFFORDABLE work. I want to conduct my business with that in mind as well. When people find out that I am reasonably priced, I hear the same thing every time: "" I have this chair...."" </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">And so, my business success is based on my favorite quote: </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">""Everyone has a chair"".</span></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Support isn't just Financial.</h3>
<div>If you believe in me but don't have the financial means to support my endeavor, email me to say so! I once got a thank you card from a couple who I had done a chair for. I still have it, because it reminds me that people love my work, they think I am talented, and they want to tell me so. It is inspirational and it drives me to keep doing what I love. Email me! Write me! I will be forever thankful to you for the effort and support.</div>

I have created a budget for rent, monthly costs and supplies. The part I really need help with are the start up costs. Start up costs are always more than you think, and you have to be prepared. Having these costs covered, even in part,  will ensure that my launch pad for this business is clear. I've calculated profit margins, inventory costs and have a clear business plan;  the costs associated with first moving into a new space are what I need help with.  I need to set up a debit machine, buy an inexpensive work laptop to do my webdesign and updates on. I need to make some bulk purchases of supplies like tacking, fabric and upholstery foam. I also need to purchase retail necessities like bags for my pillow sales and signage. Part of the start up costs will be allocated to social media and website promotion. These are things that need to be purchased from the start so that I can concentrate on building stock and booking clients. Whoever decides to contribute to my project funding will be forever in my mind, and I want to show my appreciation. For donations of $50 or over,  I will be hand writing special thank you cards along with a set of handmade paper gift tags for your use. For donations over $100, I will gladly send you a 16 by 16 inch pillow cover in your choice of fabrics I have hand-picked. I want you to have a real 'in your hand' (or on your chair!) token of my appreciation. Those that donate $300 and over I will have their names added to a wall in my studio. Your name will be on a plaque to remind me daily that you helped me make my dream possible. I will also add your name to my website on a special ""thank you"" page.  If posting your name publicly is something you'd rather not have, I'll happily send you a pillow cover, some handmade tags and a handwritten thank you card to show you my immense appreciation. You believed in my vision, and it means the world to me.                   




  Seeing is Believing.
I have clear goals for my business. I have other creative outlets that ensure I am always creating regardless of my list of projects. I sew pillows because I love how easily they transform a room. I love design and especially love the inspiration that can spring from seeing color combinations. I want to vamp up social media and website advertising so that I can successfully sell these items online. I have stores that are interested in commissioning my pillows and paper craft items and I need a studio space to act as a productive hive for stock. Upholstery is my focus, but these other projects ensure that I am always creating and being inspired. It doesn't hurt that they have high profit margins! 


The upholstery aspect of my work has a few important streams of income. I have been commissioned to do many pieces for people who have fabrics and ideas that they just need someone to carry out. I love working with clients who want their own visions brought to life. Seeing their faces when their project is complete is truly amazing! 

Design revival is another area I enjoy. Buying a piece that needs TLC is as easy as opening Kijiji in your browser. Everything has potential. When you buy a chair that needs redoing, the possibilities are endless. Choosing the fabric and style has got to be the most FUN I'll ever have with my work. Every piece that I've done this with has sold, and sold quickly. I'm good at this!


Eventually, I want to be able to teach others to do simple upholstery. After a few years in the studio I'll pursue either in-studio classes or online tutorials. Weekend projects for those who want to learn and who are DIYers don't take away from your business if they are paying you for help and guidance! 
 When I move into my studio and set up all that I need to be successful in my space, I'll be reflecting on how I got here. The inspiration I experience daily will finally be able to flow in a studio atmosphere, and there will be nothing to stop me from achieving my goals. I would absolutely love to have an emailing list of all my funding supporters so that I can update you on progress, achievements and goals.



  Challenges.  When you have been in business management for as long as I have, the phrase most uttered is, ""expect everything to go wrong"". In the bar industry, it was a daily struggle to keep the beer fridge chugging along or the food from the kitchen to come out at a reasonable time. You've got to be ready for anything. It's a bit different in the design industry, but not much. You might need to deal with unhappy clients once in awhile, or your tools may fail you. These sorts of challenges must be met with the same patience, common sense and problem solving skills, though. Keep your clients happy, your inspiration flowing and your income coming. If you chose to do something, do it full on and do it right. My workmanship and dedication to my clients is my focus.
Business and risk go hand in hand. The sleepless nights before signing a lease aren't different when the business is different. It's both scary and exciting;  you think of the worst case scenarios and you dwell on them. I've done that for a long time. As a solution to worry and risk, I did my research and planning, and when I finished it I realized that I have something great here. I'm ready for all the challenges, risks and fear because I'm prepared for them and I have experience in solving them.
Competition is always a challenge. But one of the beauties of upholstery is the demand for AFFORDABLE work. I want to conduct my business with that in mind as well. When people find out that I am reasonably priced, I hear the same thing every time: "" I have this chair...."" And so, my business success is based on my favorite quote: ""Everyone has a chair"".
  Support isn't just Financial.
If you believe in me but don't have the financial means to support my endeavor, email me to say so! I once got a thank you card from a couple who I had done a chair for. I still have it, because it reminds me that people love my work, they think I am talented, and they want to tell me so. It is inspirational and it drives me to keep doing what I love. Email me! Write me! I will be forever thankful to you for the effort and support.





 From the bottom of my heart, thank you for your time. - Maggie",6.0,0,"5 Campaigns

on a mission to make sure these programs continue for the all of the

<h4><b>WHY A RUN FOR GRENADA 2015?</b></h4>
<p>In 2014, I was set to run the TCS New
York City Marathon and had been in training for months so you can
imagine my disappointment when I learned that I would not be
attending.  Together with <b>reachwithin </b>program coordinator, Jerry Bascombe, we decided to organise our
own marathon to coincide with the one happening in the US, taking us
up the west coast of Grenada, from St George’s to Sauteurs. It
would be my first marathon.  I did have my doubts at the start and
wondered if I would be able to finish.  From the hot sun to the hilly
terrain, could I really meet this challenge?  </p>

<p>Well I did it and what made it extra
special is that up to eighteen friends and family, inspired by our
cause and our solidarity, joined us on our quest, including Monty,
who delivers group drumming workshops for <b>reachwithin </b>and some of the boys
from Father Mallaghan’s home for boys in Victoria (where I grew
up).  This was less of a race and more a test of endurance. After
running more than 20 miles in the heat and torrential rain, we all
triumphantly arrived  at the Petite Anse Hotel, Sauteurs in just
under six hours.</p>

HELLO,  I AM DENNIS MASON...
...and on Sunday, 1 November 2015, I will be
running up the West Coast of Grenada, with a few friends, from St George's to Sauteurs, for my first
official A Run For Grenada campaign.  While this is a
challenge that I will enjoy, it means more than that to me.  It is an
opportunity to both help and inspire children across Grenada,
Carriacou & Petite Martinique, especially those living in care
homes, like I did. 
I am excited to announce that running alongside us will be Canadian actor, Brandon Jay McLaren, who plays Dale Jakes in USA Network hit show 'Graceland'. Brandons father is from the town of Grenville in Grenada.  We thank him for his generosity and kindness and very much welcome him into the team.
Dennis, in training for the 2015 A Run For Grenada





Interactive Map of A Run For Grenada

This is not just a run but a movement to help
other vulnerable youth Overcome Adversity and Inspire The Next
Generation. It’s about being a positive role model to my
peers and to the young kids growing up behind me in care homes.  I
want to show them that despite my start in life, I am not idle, I am
not a trouble-maker and I am not a lost cause. With the help of
reachwithin, I’ve taken control of my life and my future. Something
I never thought was possible.
Through reachwithin’s programs, my
peers and I were able to better control our emotions, from stress and
anger management to conflict resolution.  They also taught us
basic everyday skills, from writing a resume to making a personal
budget.  With their support, I was able to face the various challenges
that life threw at me with more confidence.


I now work full-time, I pay my bills, I
look after my physical and mental health and I do my best to give
back to my community, which includes working as a part-time
mentor for reachwithin. I can honestly say that I would not be here
today without reachwithin’s programs. That is why I am
on a mission to make sure these programs continue for the all of the
kids that live in care homes across Grenada! 



WHY A RUN FOR GRENADA 2015?
In 2014, I was set to run the TCS New
York City Marathon and had been in training for months so you can
imagine my disappointment when I learned that I would not be
attending.  Together with reachwithin program coordinator, Jerry Bascombe, we decided to organise our
own marathon to coincide with the one happening in the US, taking us
up the west coast of Grenada, from St George’s to Sauteurs. It
would be my first marathon.  I did have my doubts at the start and
wondered if I would be able to finish.  From the hot sun to the hilly
terrain, could I really meet this challenge?  
Dennis and friends run through Gouyave in 2014 






Well I did it and what made it extra
special is that up to eighteen friends and family, inspired by our
cause and our solidarity, joined us on our quest, including Monty,
who delivers group drumming workshops for reachwithin and some of the boys
from Father Mallaghan’s home for boys in Victoria (where I grew
up).  This was less of a race and more a test of endurance. After
running more than 20 miles in the heat and torrential rain, we all
triumphantly arrived  at the Petite Anse Hotel, Sauteurs in just
under six hours.

Dennis and friends at the start of their run in 2014 



I
quickly realised that I didn't have to go to the US to help the
children of Grenada, I could do it right here in my homeland. I now
want to make this an annual event, what I call A Run For Grenada.
Besides raising much needed funds for reachwithin programs it will,
hopefully, continue to encourage and inspire the next generation of
children living in care homes across Grenada. If you agree that every child deserves the best start in life, please donate to our campaign.
WHO IS reachwithin?
Founded in 2008, reachwithin's mission is to improve the futures of children who have experienced adversity or loss by helping them develop social-emotional literacy, self-confidence and resiliency in the presence of caring adults.



reachwithin predominantly works with five care homes in Grenada, including  Bel Air Home for Children and Adolescents in Calliste, St. George's; Queen Elizabeth Home in Tempe, St. George's; Dorothy Hopkins Center for the Disabled in Tempe, St. George's; and the Program for Adolescent Mothers (PAM), in Mt. Parnassus, St. George's and the Emergency Shelter Center in St. George's.
Additionally, reachwithin collaborates with the Roving Caregivers of Grenada program and Grenada’s Child Protection Authority in order to augment their outreach work in at-risk communities.
WHY SUPPORT reachwithin?
There are many charities operating in
Grenada and we are all working towards the same goal: to support the
most vulnerable throughout the tri-islands.  What makes reachwithin
unique is we support both the child AND the caregiver. By teaching a child how to regulate their behavior and a caregiver to think think differently about how they manage the child, especially when it comes to discipline, we believe it will encourage a better outcome for all.
                                           a child explores her creative side in an Arts & Crafts workshop


HOW MONEY RAISED WILL BE SPENT?
A Run For Grenada aims to raise $20,000 USD for the following:
Youth Yoga Life Skills program - $9000
Bring three (3) Karma Kids Yoga/Conscious Discipline (CD) trained facilitators in Yoga, Art and Drumming, to five (5) care homes, weekly. They will deliver around 260 classes to +200 vulnerable youth in 2016. 
Caregiver Education program - $4000
Bring early-education expert and CD trained facilitators to four (4) care homes for one (1) year. They will help coach and monitor recently trained and untrained caregivers with best practice and advice.
After Care Life Skills - $2000
Planning and development of a life skills program supporting youth transitioning out residential care.
Program Supplies - $2000
Provide children's books, arts amd crafts supplies, yoga mats, yoga decks, drum refurbishments including CD supplies to children and caregivers across Grenada in 2016.
                                           Monty facilitates a group drumming workshop at a care home



Program Supplies Transportation - $2000
Transport facilitators and supplies for programs  - including a set of 10 drums - to care homes throughout Grenada. Also helps to off-set costs for shuttling children to special events and trips across the island. 
Indiegogo Fees -$1000
perks,  misc. and admin costs.
           up to 10 Djembe drums are transported to five care homes for weekly classes


In the event that we do not reach our target of $20,000 USD by Monday, 9 November 2015, we will allocate the funds that have been raised accordingly: Youth Program- 45%, Caregiver Education- 25%, After Care Life Skills Program- 10%, Supplies- 10%, Program Transportation- 10%, Misc. Fees- 5%.

The plan is to have several branches around Perth by the end of next year, shortly followed by our interstate launch.CHEER SQUADMAKE 2016 YOUR YEARWhatever your line of work BubDesk is available to assist you in creating the lifestyle you've been searching for.CRÈCHE FACILITIESBubDesk’s crèche is state or the art:
Staffed by qualified nannies
Nap zone 
Breastfeeding room
 Our crèche caters to bubs aged 3 months to 4 years, so if day care is an issue for you please feel free to bring them along. The bub space is upstairs, while the majority of work is downstairs, allowing you to work undistracted.THE STORYMeg Burrage noticed this gap in the market when she herself became a mum and did not want to return to full time work, but at the same time, she wasn’t ready to give up her career either.  With our vast array of family friendly dining, events and amazing play spaces, not to mention the beaches… how was it that Perth catered for parents in every area except co-working spaces?? Meg started to spread word of her intentions to open BubDesk and pretty soon (like a matter of weeks!) the idea took off and in partnership with Power of Circles founder, Asha Stabback, she was on the brink of launching the solution for so many parents in Perth.BUBDESK FOR THE WORKING PROFESSIONALYou don’t have to be a self-employed entrepreneur to belong in the BubDesk community. BubDesk is also the answer for those parents on paternity leave looking to transition back into the workforce, but finding that either day care is an issue or that they’re simply not ready to be separated from their baby throughout the day. In conjunction with The Mummy Coach we can offer Perth businesses full return-to-work programmes for their new parents to encourage them back into the workforce as soon as they’re ready, helping businesses to attract and retain good female talent, while building their repuation as an employer of choice.NO BABY?BubDesk may offer crèche facilities, but that doesn't mean you need to bring a baby with you! For the Workshop Warriors amongst you, how much higher would your attendance be if you could offer your workshop as complete with crèche? For the consultants amongst you, how much easier would it be to work with your clients if they could pop their bub into the crèche for an hour while you book out a meeting pod?BECOME A FOUNDING MEMBERBubDesk is built on the foundation that there is incredible power when people come together to collaborate. With your support BubDesk will be able to bring the first female-inspired co-working space to Perth encouraging an inspiring and diverse support system.The following women have already jumped on board and will be seen regularly at BubDesk collaborating, workshopping, mentoring and inspiring you to achieving your goals.Like what you hear? Join the movement by contributing to our Indiegogo campaign. When you do, you will be become a founding member of BubDesk. Through your generosity, funds raised through will:
Help secure our dream building, the Old Perth Flour Mill, centrally located at 12 Lindsay St, Northbridge (you're going to love this place!)
Allow us to create some amazing spaces (private offices, inspiring boardroom, workshop, chill-out lounge and open co-working areas, not to mention the coolest crèche you’ve ever seen!)
Establish you as a founding member of BubDesk and in return, deliver investment related rewards

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Melissa and I have been friends since high school. On top of being an amazing friend, she is one of those rare people who is always thinking of ways to give her resources, time and energy to others. She works as a special education teacher and has given her summer breaks to serve orphan children in Uganda. While in Uganda, she met a baby girl with cerebral palsy named Lola. Melissa knew instantly that she was looking at her daughter. Ever since meeting Lola, Melissa has been working tirelessly to adopt Lola and bring her home. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When I began to think of ways to celebrate my 30th birthday, I quickly realized that what I wanted most was to give back to a friend who has given so much to me. Please help me celebrate my 30th by bringing Lola home! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Right now, Lola lays on a bed in an Uganda orphanage without the medical attention she needs due to her cerebral palsy.  Doctors have evaluated her and said that there is no reason she couldn't be walking and talking with the proper therapy. What she most needs is the love of a family and the proper, daily physical therapy.  These are two things that due to tremendous lack of resources and overpopulation the orphanages in Uganda simply cannot provide. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By giving to Bring Lola Home you will be providing Melissa with much needed funds to adopt Lola and to cover medical expenses.  You will be helping a little girl find a good home and the care she needs.  I don't know what God has in store for Lola, but I do know He has an amazing plan in mind for this little girl. Please give what you can and know that every penny you give will be of a huge help to this new family. Every penny you give will be an investment in Lola's future. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Melissa lives on a teacher's salary, and though she has never asked for funds from her friends, I know that  adopting as a single mom is tough enough without trips to Uganda, and the medical expenses of a special needs child. My goal is to raise as much as possible to help Melissa focus her energy on getting Lola healthy and happy. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>No amount is too small. Please give what you can. </p>
<p>Let's see how much we can give in 30 days for my 30th birthday.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div><div>
<p>Right now, there is no place in the area that a cheese lover can get high quality cheese cheese cut to order by the sort of professional cheesemongers that populate the streets of Europe, New York and other larger American cities.

<p></p>
<p>The reclaimed wood will come from the Moes Cider Mill in Vermilion, OH (Northeast Ohio, near Cleveland), and we need volunteers to help here too. As some of you may know, Patrick's family owns Moes Cider Mill. I grew up on the farm next to it and the business is very much a part of my family's history. The cider mill ceased operation about 15 years ago and has been sitting vacant since. There is a possibility it will be torn down in the near future and I want to keep this bit of history alive, so I have decided to incorporate as much of it into my store as possible. I will need help in removing any usable wood from the structure, including a barn door with a painting of Johnny Appleseed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition to volunteers we also need any tools you can bring. We have a few basic hand tools, but will need a lot more to do this work, and we'd rather spend the money we have on things for the store instead of tools.</p>

</div></div>","Social Socials along with St. Lukeï¿½s Roosevelt CCC/The NiteStar Program asks for your help!
 
 
The NiteStar Program began their friendship with Margaret Boogere the caretaker of The Orphans Club after we adapted their story to stage from Rory Kennedyï¿½s documentary film, ï¿½Pandemic: Facing AIDSï¿½ in 2003.  As a company we were touched by the strength the children had living with HIV and AIDS in the face of stigma, poverty and other insurmountable odds. Every year since, NiteStar has sent a donation of clothing, shoes and other gifts to the orphans.  In order to send these items we must raise over 2,000 dollars in shipping costs.  On May 19th Social Socials assisted us in hosting a Relief Jam.  It was an evening filled with a variety of performances.  We collected lots of clothes and about 400.00 but are still far away from being able to ship the clothes to the students in Uganda.   We need at least 1,000 dollars to ship the clothes and if we raise 2,000 more we can also send the students shoes, something many of them have never had before.
 
The Tororo Orphans Club currently is sponsor to 150 students either infected or affected by the HIV epidemic.  Many of them have become to primary care givers in the family after loosing the older generation to HIV/AIDS.  The Orphans Club provides shelter, support, clothing, food and a creative outlet to their affected students in Uganda.  They do this almost entirely through donations.  In a country where approx. 130,000 of the people infected with HIV are children they need our help!  Please find it in your hearts to donate $1, $2, $10 to our cause.  If a lot of people do a little bit, we can make a difference in the world. 
 
 
 Founded by Dr. Cydelle Berlin twenty two years ago, The NiteStar Program is a special project of St. Luke Rooseveltï¿½s Center For Comprehensive Care and uses a theater based model incorporating drama, music and peer education to help guide pre- adolescents, adolescents and young adults as they confront the many challenges of growing up in the age of AIDS. Productions are all original, created by the members of the company. They are culturally appropriate and age-specific, designed to diffuse myths, provide HIV/AIDS awareness, pregnancy, substance abuse and relationship violence prevention, help youth to make informed decisions, provide options for changing attitudes and prejudices, and create opportunities for behavioral change.
 
Social Socials is an organization built on the idea that helping people should be fun and enjoyable. We are entirely volunteer-based, from top to bottom. Our operating costs are typically minimal due to the fact that we work in large part in donated spaces with extraordinary talent that donate their time. No money raised goes into our own pockets, but instead goes straight to the causes for which we are celebrating. It is our goal here not only to do as much good as we can for the world, but to provide an avenue for everyone to give or to do just a little to better the state of human kind. Our purpose as people is to help and provide for one another so that our growth as a global society is constant and shared.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>CosplayMedics is a small business dedicated to nurturing cosplayers by providing resources like theatre quality make-up; ""crossplay"" supplies for both men and women; and wig sprays and detanglers. We encourage young costumers to embrace their craft and take pride in it. Cosplay is a creative art, and a chance for individuals to express themselves through fashion and roleplay.We won't sell you a costume, but we'll give you advice, and provide you with resources and encouragement along the way. With almost 14 years of cosplaying under our belts, we've accepted plenty of help with our costumes. It's time for us to return the favor.</p>
<p>Our campaign is actually two endeavors that happen to play well together. Good hygiene is a problem that plagues the cosplay community, and CosplayMedics wants to grow and nurture that same community. So, any funds that do not directly assist in freshening up convention attendees, will then be given to CosplayMedics to help with business costs. CosplayMedics will then, work to create enough profit to purchase more supplies to freshen up even more convention attendees. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign is a battle for a better con experience. Ever walked into the convention hall and caught a whiff of someone who makes your nosehairs curl? Or caught a terrible case of the ""con crud""? These issues wouldn't nearly be as bad if everyone attending simply showered daily, wore deodorant, and washed their hands regularly.</p>
<p>That's not to say that simple means easy. Hygiene problems have plagued conventions ever since the beginning of Geekdom, and it will take a lot of time and energy to help make it better. We plan on educating attendees, as well as providing solutions, in hopes that eventually, every con-goer will smell as sweet as a spring breeze.</p>
<p>We will start at <u>Sakuracon 2012</u>, and move on from there. The more people donate, the more conventions we can visit!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The biggest problem with getting people to wash, is to make sure they are provided with enough resources and encouragement. This means purchasing travel-sized amenities in huge quantities and having people around to hand them out. While I plan on volunteering my time for these endeavors, if I need more manpower, I will most likely be thanking my helpers with meals and convention badges. </p>
<p>If we just barely miss our goal, and raise $3999, the cost break down will look like this.</p>
<p>     $1360 - Deodorant wipes in masculine and feminine scents</p>
<p>     $1200 - Soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste</p>
<p>     $1080 - Donation gifts, convention badges and meals for helpers</p>
<p>     $359.91 - Indiegogo fees</p>
<p>     $0.09 - Invested in CosplayMedics, to help grow the business and spread the love to other conventions</p>
<p>So, what do you get out of this?</p>
<p>Well, approximately $0.64 out of every dollar will go towards amenity kits for the stinky masses, so you will know that no matter how much or little you help us, you will be making at least one person cleaner. Other than that, there are some gifts that might interest you. The Con Survival Kit is there to save you from hunger, as is the ""Food and Drink"" event. The more people that choose the ""Food and Drink"" event, means more money for better food and a better venue. <u>The venue will be locked down 3 weeks before Sakuracon 2012</u>. The rest of the perks are pretty straight forward; if a little cosplayer-centric. Of course, you can opt to not take a perk, in which case, you would be gaining that much more love from us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't have a lot of cashola? That's fine too. CosplayMedics still needs lots of people to spread the word! Feel free to link us on Facebook, Twitter, your favorite forum, whatever! The more people who see this, the better chance we have of meeting our goal.</p>

<h3>The (brief) Vision</h3>
<p>I've been a proud resident of Muncie for nearly 16 years. I've been working in Indy for 5 of those, and in that time I've gotten to experience some things that Muncie just doesn't have.  One of those things is the beauty of food trucks.  By now, most of you have heard of them, and hopefully you've gotten to enjoy them.  I would like to get the ball rolling with Muncie's first food truck, Slop on Top.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Slop on Top Needs </h3>
<p>Very simply, we need some money and interest to get things started.  I'd like to prove that there is enough interest in order to make this happen as well.  The more supporters I have, regardless of size, the more proof I have that this is something Muncie wants and deserves.  All but the smallest pledges will get you a fairly-priced return from the truck.  This isn't a handout, this is the equivalent of a pre-order, so pledge generously, and I'll be able to this thing running in time for the first months of BSU.</p>
<p>I already have the truck, so the money will be going to make the modifications to turn it into a Slop-slingin' Supertruck. The goal amount of $8000 is based on the various things that need to happen to the truck before its ready for prime time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cooking/restaurant equipment ( majority of expenses )</li>
<li>3 bay sink &amp; wash sink installed</li>
<li>Ventilation </li>
<li>Plumbing, both water and gas</li>
<li>Generators &amp; electrical work to accomodate </li>
<li>Installation of serving window </li>
<li>Fresh water storage and waste water collection</li>
<li>Vinyl graphic wrap for the truck</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Bigger Vision</h3>
<p>I want to give back to Muncie.  I want to see it be able to revel in some of the fun and deliciousness that is experienced elsewhere.  I think we can start something big with this first foray into food trucks in Muncie.</p>
<h3>""So wait, what will Slop on Top serve?""</h3>
<p>I love delicious food, but equally, I love affordable.  I want to offer something that hits both of those marks.  Slop on Top, as the name suggests, will be serving you a delicious ( though admittedly ""sloppy"" ) concoction atop a bed of rice ( or potentially some other ""substrate"" ).  So many cultures have found the beauty of rice, and made it a staple in their dishes. Take some time and imagine how many different cultures do this: Indian, Chinese, Thai, Mexican, Cajun/Creole, African, Spanish, and surely many more. Many times this is in the form of some colorful, tasty goodness, heaped on top of a bed of rice.  That is approximately the vision of Slop on Top: a heap of rice, covered with a tasty concoction, served to you at a price that will make you feel happy.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>""I don't have much money, but I love the idea... ""</h3>
<p>Ok, there are going to be some people that I will hear say this.  Don't worry about it, but please consider giving a small pledge, and give us a whole bunch of social support.  Tell your ""wealthier"" friends, and encourage them to be a part of this movement!  You know how this stuff works.  Twitter and Facebook have changed the world, and I'm expecting your help in doing so here in Muncie. :)</p>

<h3>About the brand</h3>
<p>Born and raised in India, Avni Trivedi has a unique vision in the fashion industry and has established herself as a women's clothing designer, based out of Boston.  </p>
<p>Avni's mission is to create environmentally conscious fashion collections that support the cottage fabric-making industry and the talented artisans in her native country.  The fabrics used in Avni's collections are 100% hand-dyed, woven, and embroidered by artisans.<img alt=""Avni Fashion"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.habitmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/avni-fashion.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;""/></p>
<p><span>With a new addition to the designer and her family, their daughter Aanya, there will also be an addition to the Avni brand; an organic, naturally dyed baby wear line.</span></p>
<p><span>This campaign is to help fund the development of this line. Organic products are crucial to newborns to ensure their healh, safety, and development.  Each garment is hand-made and dyed using various herbs and flowers found in nature.  The dyes are created from recycled flowers, pomegranite skins, and even onion peels.</span></p>
<p><span>We strive to make organic baby wear an affordable option for consumers.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How will my donation be used?</h3>
<p>Our goal to start production of the baby wear line is between $10,000 and $15,000.  This money will help pay for materials needed, labor costs, and distribution of the products.  </p>
<p>The materials needed to produce the line include: fabric, dyes, thread, buttons, snaps, zippers, etc. </p>
<p>The funding will also help cover the labor costs for the artisans in India.  They include our embroiderers, stitchers, fabric-makers, dyers, and our pattern makers.</p>
<p>Your donations will also be used to support the ""Because I am a Girl"" foundation.  This charity is focused on providing opportunites for underprivileged girls around the world.  Donations made will not only help to provide food, clean water, and healthcare, but will also enable these young ladies to receive an education and pursue their dreams. <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sarahmjamieson.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/biag-support-magenta1.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: bottom;""/></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, these funds will be used in the same manner to assist with the production of the organic baby wear line.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The rise in awareness of the benefits of organic products has created a demand in the market for environmentally friendly products.  These products do not only benefit the environment, they also benefit our health and our future.</p>
<p>Organic products are especially important when it comes to babies.  A newborn's skin is extremely thin and sensitive and will very easily absorb the harmful chemicals that are commonly used in clothing production.</p>
<p>At Avni Fashion, we are striving to make organic baby wear more readily available for the continually growing eco-friendly economy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>With your generous donation, we are offering many different perks to show our appreciation.  </p>

Our goal to start production of the baby wear line is between $10,000 and $15,000.  This money will help pay for materials needed, labor costs, and distribution of the products.  
The materials needed to produce the line include: fabric, dyes, thread, buttons, snaps, zippers, etc. 
The funding will also help cover the labor costs for the artisans in India.  They include our embroiderers, stitchers, fabric-makers, dyers, and our pattern makers.
Your donations will also be used to support the ""Because I am a Girl"" foundation.  This charity is focused on providing opportunites for underprivileged girls around the world.  Donations made will not only help to provide food, clean water, and healthcare, but will also enable these young ladies to receive an education and pursue their dreams. 

If we do not reach our goal, these funds will be used in the same manner to assist with the production of the organic baby wear line.


The Impact
The rise in awareness of the benefits of organic products has created a demand in the market for environmentally friendly products.  These products do not only benefit the environment, they also benefit our health and our future.
Organic products are especially important when it comes to babies.  A newborn's skin is extremely thin and sensitive and will very easily absorb the harmful chemicals that are commonly used in clothing production.
At Avni Fashion, we are striving to make organic baby wear more readily available for the continually growing eco-friendly economy.


What's in it for you?
With your generous donation, we are offering many different perks to show our appreciation.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Remembering Jaclyn</h3>
<p>IF you are looking at this, you were impacted by Jaclyn's friendship. She was the kind of person who would drop anyhing to help. She was always talking about her children, she loved them with every fiber of her being. The goal of this fund is to make sure we as a community take care of her children, in whatever way we can.</p>
<p>Jaclyn was planning Andy's birthday before she died, I'd like to be able to meet the goal to be able to give it to him on his birthday.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I set the goal at $2,000. </p>
<p>The children's grandmother Sandy is taking care of the children. Lets support her as a community and help her financially. Is 2,000 a good goal? I'm not sure, but I'd like to think its a feasible one for the time being.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Jaclyn's children lost everything in an instant. We are all heartbroken for them. A monetary gift for Andy's birthday would remind the family that we are standing by them. We will never forget Jaclyn, she was a beautiful mother.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Remember that food and cards are helpful too even if you can't give money. Most of all, never forget who Jaclyn was. She was our friend and we loved her. Keep her in your heart forever.</p>

<h3>Justice4Vee Campaign</h3>
<p>Friday, Sepember 21 Eva (Vee) Ampaw was unjustly removed from her business by Mr. David Hillary, owner of Hillary's Cleaners in Ottawa. After the incident, she was left with nothing from her business, and now has to fend for herself.</p>
<p>Hi Everyone, my name is Phoebe Ampaw and I am campaining to raise money to help cover the legal costs for my mother Vee. </p>
<p>Just a taste of who Vee really is, my mother is that woman who always makes sure people are welcomed and feel at home. As a university student, I have many friends that live on campus. And the one thing that really amazed me about my mother was on Thanksgiving Day when my she asked me to invite all my friends who were away from home to come and have Thanksgiving dinner with our family. She did this because she knew the value of family and, as a student, being far away from home on a family holiday is not easy. It makes me laugh, as I remember my mother dishing out leftovers in tupperware for my friends to take back to to their homes on campus.</p>
<p>This campaign is very dear to my heart because Vee is the kind of woman and mother who is always giving out of the depths of her heart whether or not she has. Now that her business has been unjustly taken from her, it really bothers me to see my mom struggle to afford a lawyer. So, I have taken matters into my own hands along with my sister (Anna Ampaw), and two very close friends (Vanessa Hayford and Samih Abiad) to give back and help my mother out.</p>
<p>As of now, Vee has contacted a lawyer and costs will undoubtedly come up as the legal process goes on. Our plan is to raise $5000 which we hope will cover these costs.</p>
<p>Hillary's Cleaners is a large dry cleaning chain in Ottawa which has been around for over 60 years. We find it it so unjust that such a big company can take advantage of a small company such as Vee Tailoring. As Canadian citizens we all have rights and priviledges and those who feel they have the power to override these rights must be held accountable for their actions. We have complete faith in our community and we are confident that justice will prevail.</p>

</div></div>","My Story


I am an Artist ,a Creative Consultant, and an adjunct faculty member at Harford Community College and the TAI Sophia Institute for the Healing Arts, both in Maryland.  I believe in the importance of creative service.  I do this through sharing my personal artwork and helping others tap into their creativity by sharing knowledge and experience from my life.

On October 14th, 2011, I leave for Kenya, Africa. Through a program entitled “Kenya Calling”, I have the
opportunity to experience African culture through direct, hands-on
experiences.  Under the leadership
of facilitators David Baum and Kathy Karn, who have partnered with “Free the
Children” and “Me to We”, I will visit Kenya
for ten days.  David and Kathy
specialize in bringing together groups of strangers from all walks of life and
creating communities that make a difference in the world.

In a unique cross-cultural exchange with the local people of the Masai-Mara, I'll engage in personal encounters with women leaders and local elders,and perform service work within their community.  I will also assist in building a school.  By immersing myself in the community David and Kathy and the Masai-Mara create with us, I will absorb a great deal that I can pass on to others.

Why am I going to Kenya specifically? Thirty years ago, I was
working in a bookstore in Washington, DC when a book entitled Masai appeared on our bookshelves. The visible joy and nobility of these people was captivating to me.   I promised myself that if the opportunity to visit arose, I would take it.  There are moments in our lives that open up before us as potential soulful encounters.  Seeing the photographs in that book was Kenya calling to me. I am responding with an enthusiastic ""Yes!""

When I show up to any situation, I
show up as an artist.  There is no way to
separate who I am from what I do.  As
artists, we envision, we dream, we bring possibilities..  Possibilities bring engagement and engagement
benefits every community.   From the moment I said yes to this trip, I have felt profoundly inspired.  Inspiration is contagious.  Help me pass it on.

.


The Impact


Through this experience in Africa, I
hope to find a deeper strength inside myself, the joy of giving, and profound
inspiration.  I will be exposed to different people, customs, languages, foods, smells, wildlife and the extraordinary heritage of the Kenyan landscape.    Entirely
new sensations and experiences will inspire art work that would not be possible
to create if I stayed at home.  I
will be profoundly changed by this trip and a dream, 30 years in the making, will be fulfilled. 

Upon my return, I intend to find a way to effectively communicate my experience with as many people as possible: reflections on the impact that each of us has on the entire planet, a better understanding of water as a precious resource, an embodiment of deep gratitude that world travel, especially to developing countries, offers us.

Thus far, I am planning talks, free and open to the public in the
Baltimore, Harford County, MD and New Rochelle, New York communities.  My college students, creativity group, and those I consult with will
also benefit.

Other ways you can help:
  ** Spread the word!  Post a link on your Facebook or other social media page.
  ** Request that someone make a donation in your name instead of giving you a birthday/anniversary or other kind of gift you don't really want or need.
  ** Make a donation in the name an aspiring artist you know.
  ** Donate a week's latte and pastry money.  Food is essentially rented and the gift you'll receive for donating is for keeps.

<p><strong>          </strong>A Loving Legacy is a non-profit organization dedicated to preserving the legacy of children and adults who have a serious or terminal illness (Cancer, ALS, Alzheimers, etc.), as well as seniors in the ""Golden Age"" of life (75 or older), regardless of health. </p>
<p align=""center"">""Legacy"" videos are produced FREE of charge for our clients!!</p>
<p>            Legacy"" videos provide a way for our clients to tell the stories about their lives they want people to remember.  Some have recounted stories from their youth and how they were raised, and the memories they have of those days gone by.  This is also a good opportunity to tell your family history.  Others have taken the opportunity to speak about their illness and how it has affected their outlook on life.    Legacy videos are also an excellent opportunity for people to leave behind parting words of Love, Wisdom, and Encouragement for friends and loved ones, for some of life's future events such as;  Graduations, Weddings, or the birth of a child</p>
<p>            A Legacy video is a not only a great way to preserve your legacy within your circle of friends; it also serves as a great benefit to future generations in general.  Who better to hear stories from the past, than from those who actually experienced it?</p>
<p>            For young children, we focus on the positive!  The videos we produce for their families highlight the spirit within the child.  We spend some time with both the child and their family and capture them at play, and being creative.  We then take the footage we capture, and add it to home video and photos provide by the family, to make a final video that celebrates the child's young life.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The response we have received from surviving family members, hospital administrators, and video subjects themselves has been overwhelming.  Most all have said that our service is something they would have never thought of, or had the capability to do on their own.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I now know first hand just how important and impactful a Legacy video can be.  During the structure of this campaing, my father passed away from a sudden heart attack.  Thankfully, just 6 weeks prior to his un-expected death, we sat down with him and filmed him telling his life story.  Now, myself and my siblings will always have that video to watch, when we are missing him and just need to hear his voice again.  More importantly, my 6 year old daughter, will be able to watch that as she grows older, and remember who her grandpa was and what his life was like. </p>
<p><strong>What we need: </strong></p>
<p>We are currently working in conjunction with several well known hospitals to provide our service to seriously ill patients at their facilities.  However, a hospital is not the most quiet and private place to shoot such an emotional video.   Not to mention the fact that there are many other patients in the facilities, that can be easily disturbed by us setting up our equipment, even though we shoot with a single camera, and no lights.  So, after several meetings with staff and administrators, we have agreed that having the ability to bring a mobile studio to the hospital, and bring the patients out to us would be the best all around solution.  This allows us to have complete control of the production environment, as well as making it comfortable for other patients in the hospital.    </p>
<p>**UPDATE***  We have recently been invited by several organizations that deal with ALS, Alzheimers, and Cancer patients to attend various events they are putting on.  The ability to have this trailer on-site at these events, means that we will be able to produce several videos at each event.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need to raise $20,000 in order to purchase the trailer and get it set-up.  Your TAX DEDUCTABLE  donation will go toward the following:</p>
<p>20 foot enclosed cargo trailer -              $8,000</p>
<p>Sound Walls for inside of trailer -           $2,000</p>
<p>Custom Trailer Wrap -                          $2,000</p>
<p>Studio Lighting -                                  $1,500</p>
<p>Sound Equipment                                 $1,500</p>
<p>Generator                                            $1,000</p>

<p>Structural and Electrical Modifications       $2,000</p>
<p>Air Conditioning Unit                             $1,000</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our organization and production team is made up of  all volunteers who work in not only the professional film and video industries, but various other professions such as Marketing and Accounting.  All have agreed to donate their time to help our organization provide this service.</p>

<h3>My sister and I need a attorney who will fight for us.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>WE NEED TO BRING LIGHT ON THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WHO ARE USING CHILDREN FOR FINACIAL GAIN! THIS CHILD HAS BEGGED TO COME HOME OR BE PLACED WITH HER SISTER (ME) AND SHE IS NOT BEING RETURNED DUE TO MY MOTHER HAVING ASPERGERS SYNDROME AND IS BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Amber and my little sister has been in foster care for over 3 years now. I have been trying to gain custody of her since she was removed from my mother's care. I was never contacted or offered custody when she was taken, and I have been fighting ever since but since I have no legal background or money to hire an attorney both my rights and my sister's rights are continuing to be violated. This video was taken 6 months after they were removed from my mother's care and she is trying to explain that she was being physically abused; bitten, scratched, hit by an adult in the home. The more I have tried to fight for our rights the more I have been ailenatied from my sister. I have not been allowed phone calls for over 5 months, when I did get a short visit 2 years ago she did nothing but cry to come home, she complained about her tummy hurting, and aches in her limbs. All caused by improper food she is given. She has celiac disease and can not tollerate wheat or gluten in her diet. Yet the county has refused doctor paperwork and continues to feed my sister food full of gluten. She was on a wheat and gluten free diet for 5 years prior to being taken. Now not being on the proper diet is shattering her insides. She needs to be back on the diet ASAP!</p>
<p>I was told by the social workers that because I have a good relationship with my mother that is why they ""punish"" me from having contact with my sister and refuse to act on my requests to have her placed in my home. I have researched my rights and I know what they are doing is illegal but without a lawyer who knows the proper steps to take to express my rights and my sister's rights we will cnntinue to suffer at the hands of a very cruel state. </p>
<p> As you can see in the additional video I have 2 sisters who are both in foster care.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>I need funds in order to hire a attorney who is established in juvenile law and is familiar with CPS and childen in foster care. I have reached out to many attorneys and no one is willing to help without being able to be paid.</p>
<p>Any money raised will go toward legal help to bring my sister back home to me. I feel we are lost in the system and I will continue to fight for my sister.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The more I research and try to find help for my family, the more I find there are  so many children who are being abused in state care, if you can't contribute financially I beg everyone to share this video, please help me spread the light on a very corrupt system.</p>

<h2><strong>We are Robert, Diane and Ana and we love our neighbourhood! </strong></h2>
<h3><strong><em>When Robert Sutherland came up with the idea of bringing this old Studebaker truck from the farm to the city and giving it a new life serving the needs of the community, everyone got pretty excited.</em></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>We believe in preserving things of value, both old and new, finding ways to give back and building resilient communities where people help each other out. And that's exactly what this truck will help us do. </strong></h3>
<p>Everyone has ideas about how the truck can be used to help out around here- from urban agriculture to street party fundraisers, and we know ""Clem"" will become a beloved member of the Mount Pleasant family. Officially an M16-52 this truck has an amazing personality and a strong family history of service going way back from the early days of the first Studebaker covered wagons in the 1850's to the Second World War and beyond. (history buffs see more in the link below . . .)</p>
<p>But let's let Clem tell the story of how he came from the farm to the city from his point of view . . .</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 120px;"">*   *   *   *   *   *  *   *  *   *</h2>
<p><em><strong>Howdy folks! My name is Clement but most everybody calls me ""Clem"". I am named after Clement Studebaker who was the founder of the Company with older brother Henry in 1852.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>I was born in 1946</strong>. Some people would say that’s too old to be starting a new life, but I disagree. I’m pretty stoked (as the kids say) about my move to the big city!</p>
<p>But let me tell you a bit more about myself first. . . .As I said, I was born 66 years ago, just after World War II. A lot of my brothers and sisters served in that war, and the previous one.</p>
<p>But the history of my family goes way back to 1852 and the covered wagon that brought the Studebaker family to South Bend, Indiana where they set up their blacksmith shop.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.studebakerhistory.com/dnn/Portals/0/CarriageAd2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>My relatives did some pretty famous things way back- won an award at the World’s Fair in Paris, drove presidents and other famous people, even had electric cars in the family for a bit before anyone else – and one of my distant relatives was the famous Pierce Arrow. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>As for me, I’ve served most of my life so far on the farm</strong> - I hauled coal and grain. Nothing fancy . . . . ended up on the farm in Penhold, Alberta, with Jim, who took real good care of me for the past 8 years - I guess you could say I was retired there for a bit- had a nice shed that kept me warm and dry. But not much to do . . . it was a bit boring, to tell you the truth.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/c156.0.403.403/p403x403/575276_10151326063082174_697145902_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>And then to my surprise, Jim started to look for a new home for me. His ad was answered by <strong>Robert Sutherland</strong>, community organizer for Livable Laneways, all-round good guy, and jack of all trades who lives here, in Mount Pleasant-- a guy who loves old stuff as much as Jim does so they hit it off right away, and a few weeks back, Rob journeyed by train and bus over the mountains and came out to the farm to meet me.</p>
<p>Liked him right off. He’s a quiet guy, like Jim. No nonsense. Down to earth.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Well, long story short</strong>, they loaded me onto a big old transport truck and off I went to my new home here in Mount Pleasant. Never would have imagined that in a million years!</p>

<h2><strong>So folks we sure could use your help! <br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong>We're asking all our friends</strong> for a few <strong>gifts</strong> this Christmas that will help get me fixed up so I can give my best to my new family here in Mount Pleasant. Every little bit helps!</p>
<p><em><strong>We're proud to say we have local trades, craftspeople and artists to handle the restoration work and advise the team so that all the work is done right. The basic list goes something like this:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I sure could use a new set of <strong>tires</strong> --<strong>$2,000</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Seat belts</strong> were never a worry where I lived before, but I'll need those here for sure!--<strong>$500</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Inspection and licensing</strong> is important-can't go anywhere without that!  -- <strong>$500</strong><strong><br/></strong>
</li>
<li>My <strong>mirrors</strong> are missing as are <strong>wipers,</strong> and the <strong>electrics</strong> could use a re-doing. <strong>Seats</strong> not good for much any more either.<span>  -- </span><strong>$2,000<br/></strong>
</li>
<li>All my rubber seals on doors and windows as well as the interior liners need replacing too! Don't want the rain getting in. --<strong>$1,000<br/></strong>
</li>
<li>
<p>My <strong>paint</strong> has worn thin and is starting to show bare metal – not good in rainy Vancouver.  A good thorough job from top to bottom so that my next 66 years are as great as the last will cost<span> <strong> --</strong></span><strong>$3,000</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And I'll need <strong>a home</strong>-- a safe place to live until we're up and running and I can afford to pay the rent myself --<strong>$1000</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
</li>
</ul><h2>The Big Picture- Why is this important now?</h2>
<p>You might be wondering exactly what the bigger picture is here. How will your contribution help make a difference beyond fixing up an old farm truck? Well I'll tell you. I'm proud to say that when I'm ready to go, I will become a kind of symbol around here. People will say ""there goes Clem"". Folks will have their picture taken with me. I'll be like a member of the Mount Pleasant family. And that means I'll play a role in making folks feel more connected.</p>
<p>What's often missing in the big city is a feeling that you are part of a community. And that's a sad thing- something that we can help to change. I'll be all about helping folks help each other. Bringing people together to make this place better. And I hope I'll be a good example of what you can do in YOUR community- maybe through an <strong>indiegogo</strong> campaign like this one-- to bring back that feeling of connection and interdependence. You gotta start somewhere!</p>

<h2>Thanks! And watch for updates . . .</h2></div>","We are Robert, Diane and Ana and we love our neighbourhood! 
When Robert Sutherland came up with the idea of bringing this old Studebaker truck from the farm to the city and giving it a new life serving the needs of the community, everyone got pretty excited.
We believe in preserving things of value, both old and new, finding ways to give back and building resilient communities where people help each other out. And that's exactly what this truck will help us do. 
Everyone has ideas about how the truck can be used to help out around here- from urban agriculture to street party fundraisers, and we know ""Clem"" will become a beloved member of the Mount Pleasant family. Officially an M16-52 this truck has an amazing personality and a strong family history of service going way back from the early days of the first Studebaker covered wagons in the 1850's to the Second World War and beyond. (history buffs see more in the link below . . .)
But let's let Clem tell the story of how he came from the farm to the city from his point of view . . .
*   *   *   *   *   *  *   *  *   *
Howdy folks! My name is Clement but most everybody calls me ""Clem"". I am named after Clement Studebaker who was the founder of the Company with older brother Henry in 1852.
I was born in 1946. Some people would say that’s too old to be starting a new life, but I disagree. I’m pretty stoked (as the kids say) about my move to the big city!
But let me tell you a bit more about myself first. . . .As I said, I was born 66 years ago, just after World War II. A lot of my brothers and sisters served in that war, and the previous one.
But the history of my family goes way back to 1852 and the covered wagon that brought the Studebaker family to South Bend, Indiana where they set up their blacksmith shop.

My relatives did some pretty famous things way back- won an award at the World’s Fair in Paris, drove presidents and other famous people, even had electric cars in the family for a bit before anyone else – and one of my distant relatives was the famous Pierce Arrow. 
 
As for me, I’ve served most of my life so far on the farm - I hauled coal and grain. Nothing fancy . . . . ended up on the farm in Penhold, Alberta, with Jim, who took real good care of me for the past 8 years - I guess you could say I was retired there for a bit- had a nice shed that kept me warm and dry. But not much to do . . . it was a bit boring, to tell you the truth.

And then to my surprise, Jim started to look for a new home for me. His ad was answered by Robert Sutherland, community organizer for Livable Laneways, all-round good guy, and jack of all trades who lives here, in Mount Pleasant-- a guy who loves old stuff as much as Jim does so they hit it off right away, and a few weeks back, Rob journeyed by train and bus over the mountains and came out to the farm to meet me.
Liked him right off. He’s a quiet guy, like Jim. No nonsense. Down to earth.
 
Well, long story short, they loaded me onto a big old transport truck and off I went to my new home here in Mount Pleasant. Never would have imagined that in a million years!

 
Anyway - what my new friends want to do is get me back into doing what I do best- helping folks get stuff done. Only here in the city it’ll be a bit different.


Jude and Charmaine at The Beaumont Studios say I’ll come in handy as a stage for community events- like Car Free Day!


I can haul wood for building things around the neighbourhood- that’s what Rob does and boy does he need my help! 


 

I can help out with moving loads of soil for community gardens . . .this is Kristy with Rob at the garden.


 


Mike over at eight 1/2 bistro & lounge, along with the Mount Pleasant Business Improvement Association, has a plan for collecting compost from local restaurants and I can help out there too. Tell you one thing- I won’t be bored.



 
So here’s what I’m thinking - I’m a bit short on the things the team here needs to get me up and running safely - get me back into top shape for my new tasks. What I need is a makeover!
Here's what I look like now . . . a little bit the worse for wear . . .

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

. . . and here's what I'll look like after my makeover! Awesome! 


 
So folks we sure could use your help! 
We're asking all our friends for a few gifts this Christmas that will help get me fixed up so I can give my best to my new family here in Mount Pleasant. Every little bit helps!

<p>Working with body awareness and gentle inquiry, we can discover together what is true in each moment, letting go of old ideas and painful stories that no longer serve us, and are frankly no longer true.</p>
<p>Toward this end, I have started Body of Wisdom, offering workshops, classes, and counseling sessions to people who are ready to step fully into their lives. Our bodies are a source of endless wisdom and wonder, and hold the key to our unfolding.</p>
<p>Our campaign is to raise funds to cover some important startup costs: software, webhosting, marketing, and deposits for site rentals for the workshops and classes I'm going to teach.

</ul></div>","Short Summary
Working with body awareness and gentle inquiry, we can discover together what is true in each moment, letting go of old ideas and painful stories that no longer serve us, and are frankly no longer true.
Toward this end, I have started Body of Wisdom, offering workshops, classes, and counseling sessions to people who are ready to step fully into their lives. Our bodies are a source of endless wisdom and wonder, and hold the key to our unfolding.
Our campaign is to raise funds to cover some important startup costs: software, webhosting, marketing, and deposits for site rentals for the workshops and classes I'm going to teach. In particular, having the right kinds of meditation cushions available will help people be relaxed in their bodies so that they can get the most out of our body-awareness practices.
Your contributions will help us support people in waking up to their full potential, learning from their bodies how to heal and how to love. It has been our experience that people who are alive and awake in this way become more available to give back to their families and communities. They are less prone to addiction and distraction. They discover the true nature of freedom.
What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $4000 to cover some of our more expensive startup costs:


$2500 for meditation cushions, including zafus, zabutons (floor cushions), gomdens, and small pillows for fine adjustment.


$600 for software and web-hosting, including database and Adobe design software.


$700 for site rental deposits for workshops and classes.


$200 for marketing expenses, including ads, fliers, and free introductions.

Our perks:


We have decided to offer things that we ourselves have found useful for meditation: stainless steel water bottles, cozy fleece blankets, and our favorite local meditation cushions:


The zafus made by Dream Pillows of Milwaukee, Oregon, are covered with durable hemp fabric and stuffed with millet.

Should you choose this perk, we will write to you to offer you a choice of colors.


We also offer discounts and complementary workshop attendance, culminating in a private 12-person Body of Wisdom intensive for one lucky contributor.

If we raise more than our goal:


It is important to us to keep our offerings affordable. Any funds raised in excess of our stated expenses will go toward making our workshops and classes available to people with low incomes.

I want to provide high quality handcrafted items with a focus on quality leather work. I was able to get my business license for White Wing Craft &amp; Hobby, and make a few sales with materials I already had. Unfortunately rather then being able to roll the sales money back into the business I have had to put the money into a vehicle in order to have it ready to pass inspection. I would like to be able to get all of the materials necessary to be stable, and grow. Any contribution, even the smallest amount, would mean a tremendous amount to me, and put me on the right direction to independence. I have no problem working, and the value of perks for donations is fair compensation for the help provided. </p>
<p>Thank you for helping me start a local small business.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I would like to reach the goal of $700. This would allow me to get 2 full sides of leather, a variety of dyes, colored sinews, and punches, and professional leather cutting tools from quality sources such as Tandy.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary I am a crafty woman who has recently moved to a rural area with the dream of starting my own homestead. I want to provide high quality handcrafted items with a focus on quality leather work. I was able to get my business license for White Wing Craft & Hobby, and make a few sales with materials I already had. Unfortunately rather then being able to roll the sales money back into the business I have had to put the money into a vehicle in order to have it ready to pass inspection. I would like to be able to get all of the materials necessary to be stable, and grow. Any contribution, even the smallest amount, would mean a tremendous amount to me, and put me on the right direction to independence. I have no problem working, and the value of perks for donations is fair compensation for the help provided. 
Thank you for helping me start a local small business.

  What We Need & What You Get I would like to reach the goal of $700. This would allow me to get 2 full sides of leather, a variety of dyes, colored sinews, and punches, and professional leather cutting tools from quality sources such as Tandy.
In return for donations you will receive your choice of handcrafted items: bookmarks, bracelets, lanyards, collars, pouches, purses, and more. If there is something similar that isn't listed that you would be interested in instead, just ask, I don't mind doing custom work.
Even if we can't reach the full $700, I can still get plenty of materials to get started, and just continue using the ""make-shift""/adapted tools I have used previously.

  The Impact I feel that my campaign is valuable because supporting small local businesses helps keep money ""in the communities"". Quality handcrafted items, each item unique and customizable helps bring beauty and individuality to the world. Please help me bring beauty to the world.
Thank you!

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Steve Archambault and I am from Victoria BC Canada.  I am an inventor on a mission to make the world a better place. I came up with a great innovation to the existing aluminum beverage can.  A new tab that will replace the existing one.  What sets mine apart from others is that my tab will give the pop and beer can meaning.  I plan on donating majority of my royalties to a foundation I am in the process of establishing.  I am also in the process of developing an app which ties in with my foundation and tab making them all interactive.  Allowing the the user to do things in the virtual world and make them reality. </p>
<p> I see an opportunity to utilize mass global consuption and turn it into a positive to benefit the world. With the several trillion cans a year produced and the nearly 1 trillion cans that  2 of the largest beverage company produces at a penny a can that translates into 10s of billions of dollars that will go directly to tackle the most pressing isues the planets facing.  We have to stop sugar coating the issues with bandaids....we need to fix these problems before we reach the point of no return. </p>
<p>  I have sacrificed over 2 and a half years of my life and a lot of sleepless nights researching and networking.  Ive sank my life savings into getting it to where I am at and have a U.S patent pending.</p>
<p>What the funds i raise will go towards is taking it to the next level.  Filing my global patent, copyrighting/trademarking, app and foundation as they all are part of the same thing.   </p>
<p>  The amount of funding required to take this to the next level is $650, 000.00 and the money is for  the global patent, copyrighting/trademarking, the app and foundation.</p>
<p>Im going to be as transparent as i can get.  So far I have invested $120,000.00 of my own money on my tab and $20, 000.00 on the app and foundation. For the global patent, copyrighting and trademarking I require $385, 000.00 of funding, $255,000.00 for the app and foundation. The money left over is for miscelaneous costs that may pop up .  Any extra money will go directly to charity.</p>
<p>Im extremely lucky to have the support from some very amazing musicians and athletes who will be part of the foundation supporting everything we are all about.  David Kennedy from Angels and Airwaves, Shaun Verrault from Wide Mouth Mason, John Mann from Spirit of the West, Pro Mounain Bikers Steve Romaniuk and Holly Feniak, pro surfers Magnum Martinez and Nathan Hedge and these athletes will be part of team UNITING. </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am worried for future generations and the reason is we are destroying the planet.  The amount of money that  will go to making the world a better place is off the charts.  To take things to the next level requires a lot of funding but the outcome from the funding will literally change the world.  We will be able to help reforest the amazon....the lungs of the planet.  We will be able to address the humanitarian issues that we see in africa and other 3rd world countries, we will be able to push for more solar, wind and geo thermal projects.  We will be able to address the 5 floating masses of garbage that are floating around our oceans killing tens of thousands of marine life every year.  We will be able to address the sensless slaughter of endangered speicies.  We will be stimulating the economy creating thousands of jobs. </p>
<p>The thing about us humans is that we all want to see a change but we dont actually WANT to change.  What ive created will allow people to be part of the change without having to change.  Wouldnt it be great to say that we all contributed to a global change and create a better future for generations to come?  We only have one planet and she is dying.  We can either go down in history as the generation that watched the planet deteriorate and do nothing or we can UNITE and work together making the world a better place and go down in history as the generation that stepped up and saved the planet.</p>

Short Summary
My name is Steve Archambault and I am from Victoria BC Canada.  I am an inventor on a mission to make the world a better place. I came up with a great innovation to the existing aluminum beverage can.  A new tab that will replace the existing one.  What sets mine apart from others is that my tab will give the pop and beer can meaning.  I plan on donating majority of my royalties to a foundation I am in the process of establishing.  I am also in the process of developing an app which ties in with my foundation and tab making them all interactive.  Allowing the the user to do things in the virtual world and make them reality. 
 I see an opportunity to utilize mass global consuption and turn it into a positive to benefit the world. With the several trillion cans a year produced and the nearly 1 trillion cans that  2 of the largest beverage company produces at a penny a can that translates into 10s of billions of dollars that will go directly to tackle the most pressing isues the planets facing.  We have to stop sugar coating the issues with bandaids....we need to fix these problems before we reach the point of no return. 
  I have sacrificed over 2 and a half years of my life and a lot of sleepless nights researching and networking.  Ive sank my life savings into getting it to where I am at and have a U.S patent pending.
What the funds i raise will go towards is taking it to the next level.  Filing my global patent, copyrighting/trademarking, app and foundation as they all are part of the same thing.   
  The amount of funding required to take this to the next level is $650, 000.00 and the money is for  the global patent, copyrighting/trademarking, the app and foundation.
Im going to be as transparent as i can get.  So far I have invested $120,000.00 of my own money on my tab and $20, 000.00 on the app and foundation. For the global patent, copyrighting and trademarking I require $385, 000.00 of funding, $255,000.00 for the app and foundation. The money left over is for miscelaneous costs that may pop up .  Any extra money will go directly to charity.
Im extremely lucky to have the support from some very amazing musicians and athletes who will be part of the foundation supporting everything we are all about.  David Kennedy from Angels and Airwaves, Shaun Verrault from Wide Mouth Mason, John Mann from Spirit of the West, Pro Mounain Bikers Steve Romaniuk and Holly Feniak, pro surfers Magnum Martinez and Nathan Hedge and these athletes will be part of team UNITING.

<h3 style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-family: trebuchet ms,helvetica,sans-serif;""><strong>Step #2: </strong> <strong>Local organizations partner with our teas to fundraise for a set goal.</strong></span></h3>

Once we’re profitable, $0.10 of profits from the sale of our teas then goes to these groups, or allies, to help fulfill a specific funding request that may otherwise be difficult to obtain through traditional/corporate grant writing. </span></span></p>

<li><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Our teas are intensely flavored.</strong> We don’t skimp on, or water down, our ingredients. Our teas are boldly, marvelously rich and they have the opaque, full-bodied colors to back it up (deep pink, autumn, and purple), rather than the translucence that comes with a higher water ratio.

<li><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>At 10-15 g of sugar per 14 oz serving</strong>, our teas provide a lower sugar content, per bottle, than most other lightly-sweetened offerings out there.</span></span></li>

How can we help free them to do the work that they know best how to do, to make our communities more resilient, sustainable, equitable, and just?</span></span></p>
<p style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10px;""><span style=""font-size: 14px;""><span style=""font-family: 'trebuchet ms', helvetica, sans-serif;"">What if we could allow the groups we’ve organized with, groups we admire and respect, to shift some of their time and focus away from constant fundraising, from corporate grants, to the real soul of their work?

We wanted to highlight who in our community is helping build a stronger, more just, sustainable, and joyful Bay Area, and we wanted to show how all of their work is linked together; we wanted to show how so many different struggles are connected, and how so many of the solutions are also connected.

</div></div>","Ahoy there! 
We are SO excited to be here, to finally launch solidariTEA and share it with all of you! After almost two years of brewing lots and lots of tea, sourcing everything to the best quality, developing our structure, and building up and consulting with a wonderful community of mentors, etc., we’re very grateful and happy to be HERE.
Learn more about us----and our perks below and GET EXCITED!
 
How solidariTEA works:
Step #1:  Our teas support a resilient Bay Area.
Each flavor of our teas illustrates one characteristic of a resilient community; together, these different characteristics highlight who in our community is working to make it more just, sustainable, and joyful.
Step #2:  Local organizations partner with our teas to fundraise for a set goal.
Each flavor is paired with a local justice or art group who best represents that facet of community resiliency through their work. Once we’re profitable, $0.10 of profits from the sale of our teas then goes to these groups, or allies, to help fulfill a specific funding request that may otherwise be difficult to obtain through traditional/corporate grant writing. 
*Learn about our launching allies and their resilience work: People’s Grocery and the Rock Paper Scissors Collective
Step #3: Once their fundraising goals are met, partners choose the next wave of projects to fund!
After this funding request has been fulfilled through the sale of our teas, groups then choose a new ally to take their place and keep this cycle humming along.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Why our teas = awesome:

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aside from our innovative model, solidariTEA’s teas stand out because:

Our teas are intensely flavored. We don’t skimp on, or water down, our ingredients. Our teas are boldly, marvelously rich and they have the opaque, full-bodied colors to back it up (deep pink, autumn, and purple), rather than the translucence that comes with a higher water ratio. As our motto says, “Strong tea for strong community!”

Our teas are 100% premium. We use only high quality, organic ingredients (botanicals, fruits, and spices like rose petals and blueberry juice), in all of our teas, and our tea is brewed from fair-trade tea leaves.

At 10-15 g of sugar per 14 oz serving, our teas provide a lower sugar content, per bottle, than most other lightly-sweetened offerings out there.
Our vision is for our teas to become the new standard in the ready-to-drink beverage market and that our business model grows to be seen as a powerful, authentic way to develop financial sustainability within local community resilience efforts.
 
Why solidariTEA:
solidariTEA was born out of the idea: how can we, in our current, limited, financial states, support the change-makers in our communities in a real way? How can we help free them to do the work that they know best how to do, to make our communities more resilient, sustainable, equitable, and just?
What if we could allow the groups we’ve organized with, groups we admire and respect, to shift some of their time and focus away from constant fundraising, from corporate grants, to the real soul of their work? How could we take the model of a business, of our current capitalist system, and make it work for our communities?
We are doing our best to accomplish just that.
  
Why the name:
We named our tea company “solidariTEA” because we wanted to build a business that was rooted in community organizing, in community resilience work, and we wanted to work with a great range of different local groups. We wanted to highlight who in our community is helping build a stronger, more just, sustainable, and joyful Bay Area, and we wanted to show how all of their work is linked together; we wanted to show how so many different struggles are connected, and how so many of the solutions are also connected. For us, that’s what solidarity work is----and therefore, that’s what solidariTEA is about.
 
How YOU can help:
After a year and a half----and much sweat and love----we are finally ready to bring solidariTEA to the market! We’re asking for $19,500 to help us fully launch and pay for a truckload of glass bottles ($16,000+----glass and freight is expensive!) and our beautiful labels ($4,000), so we may bring solidariTEA to a Bay Area natural foods store near you! 
Any additional funds we raise will really help us get off the ground. Extra contributions will be used for: locally warehousing our teas; filling up our gas tanks to make deliveries; and paying for production runs.
If you can’t afford to contribute to our campaign----or even IF you’ve been able to contribute, and are feeling extra generous----here are four additional ways to help us out:

Email a link to our campaign to another friend/other folks who love tea, live in the Bay Area, and/or are involved in social justice work.
Share the campaign on Facebook!
Share the campaign on Twitterrrrrrr.
Follow us on your social media site of choice, or sign up for our quarterly newsletter, and come say hi when we sell or sample at a store or community event near you :)
Many thanks for reading this far, and for supporting us!
In solidarity,
Caroline & Trey


Many thanks again for supporting us! We really can’t do this without YOU :)

Our PERK lineup:


TEAshirts even CATS will love...  

NEW perk!! Our tote-ally awesome TEA-tote!
 

BAY AREA artwork on postcards...


and MAGNETS! 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and of course cases of our TEA :)

Additional Perk Info: 

Why are fewer cases of tea offered for those off the west coast, when the donation amount is the same?
Excellent question! We regret that this is the case, but we crunched the numbers, consulted with various postal services, and learned that to ship a case of our teas across the country is roughly $30----not including the value of the packaging and teas themselves.
We tried to strike a careful balance between providing awesome perks for our supporters while still retaining a solid chunk of each person’s donation so that we can really get solidariTEA off the ground. Shipping costs quickly add up (and subtract from one’s donation)----this is why more perks (including personally delivered cases of tea) are offered to those in the immediate Bay Area.
If you’re in another state or just outta the Bay and have another perk request, please let us know! We’ll work to accommodate you with extra magnets, tea-shirts, etc.

Grind Tech is a start-up company opened in 2013 and Launched its first Product the Grind Cone Grinder, a 5-piece tobacco and dry herb Grinder, in June 2014. Grind Tech Industries was founded by Tyler Nobles from Atlanta, Ga. Tyler Graduated From Georgia Southern University with his Bachelors degree in Business Management with an emphasis in Small business and Entrepreneurship. The Grind Cone was thought up by Tyler and his long time friend. The Grind Cone is one of the most functional and useful tobacco/herb grinder thats in the market today. This is a 5 piece Grinder. The top 2 pieces are just like any other grinder. The 3rd piece is a sealed cap so that no material falls out when storing the material. The 4th piece is designed for storage and to help accurately pour the material to the preferred device. The 5th and final piece, the tip is designed to help layer and pack the material as well as clear out any used material left in one's preferred device. It combines packing tools, storage tools, cleaning tools, and a way to dispense the product all in one grinder. The Grind Cone is currently made out of a Delrin/acetal material to produce the highest quality plastic grinder on the Market and allows it to stay under a $20 price point.</p><p>Grind Tech Industries is running this campaign to raise more capital to cover for new designs, run advertising/marketing campaigns and hire sales people. This campaign is important to us because it will help us reach the end users and let them know about our products through advertising and marketing with the funds from this campaign. With these funds we will also be able to come out with our design for a higher quality Grind Cone that will be made out of aircraft grade aluminum to compete it against the best Grinders on the market. The exposure alone from advertising in the popular and well circulated magazines will more than triple our business in the first quarter of next year.  We will also hire 1-2 new sale people to help cold call new stores across the nation.</p><p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p><p>We are requesting $65,000 to be funded.

Also we will have display packaging design to help attract customers in the retail outlets. We estimate that we will use $15,000 to hit the trade shows hard during 2015. We plan on going to all Champs trade shows to get exposure on all coasts. We also plan to attend the Cannabis Cup in Denver On 4/20/2015 as well as Seattle's hempfest. There are also the Glass and Vape show's, The A.G.E show's and many more smaller one's. The last $10,000 will be spent on Advertising and Marketing. We will run 4 month 1/2 page spreads in HQ(Head Quest)magazine one of the largest for the counter culture industry with over 10,000 retail stores reached. We will also advertise in High Times Magazine probably the biggest consumer magazine in the market for 4 months as well as, ERB  and Cannabis Culture Magazines.

<p>Shawn has been in the Nightclub and Bar world for 27 years. In the last 15 years in Hollywood, Shawn has helped to launch and host some of the most successful and well known nightlife spots including: Les Deux, Ivar, Cinespace, House of Blues Foundation Room, Garden of Eden, Vanguard, Ritual and Wet Republic (Las Vegas)...... To name a few! </p>
<p>Alicia moved to Los Angeles in 2009 as an Actress from Australia. Alicia also has qualifications in Marketing and Business Management and has worked for some top Global Corporations, including Brown-Forman (Jack Daniels). Alicia has been helping Shawn to run his events business since 2011, and along the way we fell in love and got married in Vegas!</p>
<p>Now.... we face our biggest challenge together...... Opening our own bar!</p>
<p>For years, many people have asked Shawn ""Why Don't You Own Your Own Bar?"" and he had many people offer to invest. But - the time wasn't right.</p>
<p>Now, we have a rock solid concept we have been developing since late 2013, and we are ready to GO!</p>
<p>The concept is simple - A sexy, welcoming, affordable and unique bar with a Vintage flair. We are creating your home away from home - a place where you can meet friends, socialize with awesome people, enjoy great cocktails and food and where the staff know your name. This bar is all about EXPERIENCES. Great people and great times. We believe Life is nothing without Moments and Memories.</p>
<p>A friend recently told us <b><i>""You can not only call yourselves Entrepreneurs, Promoters, Artists......... But, another layer........ Light Spreaders, Joy Givers, Genuine People Partners and, HAPPINESS MAKERS!""</i>.</b></p>
<p>It is our aim to make everyone who walks through our door feel SPECIAL.</p>
<p>Ever been turned away by a Door Bitch? Couldn't find free or reasonable parking or had your stuff stolen by Valet? Ever had your credit card double charged? Automatic gratuities on a 1-person tab? Ever been kicked off a table for a bottle buyer? Couldn't get on a guest list? Ever felt like you weren't cool enough?</p>
<p>Yeah, we think it sucks too. Hollywood has changed. We want to go back to the days where everyone has a place to go and feel welcome. We already have a name, a brand, a logo, an identity, a design idea, a menu, a team........ and we are now ready to start looking for the right location!</p>
<p>We have an amazing team on our side who understand our vision and are passionate, professional and unstoppable and we are looking for the right space to create our dream.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need seed money!</p>
<p>After 8 months of looking, we have now found some potential locations for our vision and the need the finances to get the wheels in motion.</p>
<p>We need $250,000 to get the project up and running. These funds will go towards:</p>

</div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The Antonio's have an exceptional track record in bringing fun and successful events to venues across Los Angeles. Now, we want to revolutionize the experience of Los Angeles Nightlife and create a new standard in our own venue.</p>
<p>Our aim is to bring people together from all walks of life, all races, all cultures and create a warm environment where everyone feels at home. We want to offer affordable, quality eats and cocktails that don't blow your budget.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The bar and restaurant industry is fraught with danger. Many, if not most, businesses in the industry in Los Angeles fail.</p>
<p>The pitfalls are ego, poor planning, lack of startup finances or overblown budgets, mis-direction, no identity, poorly trained staff, inferior quality, lack of passion, no marketing/PR, and not knowing what the hell you are doing.</p>
<p>We are acutely aware that this is not an easy venture. However - we are passionate about our business and about our friends and customers!! We have carefully crafted a vision over time that we believe meets the needs of our customers, and the 'missing' in the current market. We are HOLLYWOOD SIMPLIFIED...... taking it back to the basics.</p>
<p>Between Shawn and Alicia, we have the skill-set and experience to handle the usual pitfalls. Where we do not have the experience, we already have an expert team of people who have committed themselves to the project with us. We only have the best of the best running with us.</p>
<p>The challenge for us is finding a venue that suits our needs and is convenient/well suited to you, our friends and customers.</p>
<p>We are working with financial and business advisors to ensure we accurately budget and are prepared for every eventuality.... problems and hurdles will come up!</p>
<p> BRING IT!</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that it is a tough economy for everyone right now, but every dollar helps.</p>
<p>If Shawn has ever bought you a drink or dinner, got you a comp bottle/table, walked you into a LA or Vegas nightclub for free, hugged you when you are down, met your parents, been to your birthday party/wedding, listened to you when you needed an ear, given you advice, made you smile, made a difference for you in your life, let you sleep on his couch, bailed you out, thrown your birthday party, introduced you to your significant other, connected you with new friends, introduced you to your favorite celeb, got you into a club when you were underage (sorry!) or gone out of his way to make sure you have an amazing and memorable time........ will you please contribute to the Antonio DREAM?</p>
<p>Even if you can only spare $5, everything helps us to continue to create amazing memories with YOU, at a place we can all call home.</p>
<p>And if you absolutely cannot help us financially, PLEASE share our link with all your friends on Social Media! Pass a tin around your office and collect spare change for us! Have a baked goods sale! Get your kids to set up a Lemonade stand! Wash some cars in a bikini! Sell your stuff on Ebay!</p>
<p>Ha! </p>
<p>Just kidding..... but seriously - please help us to continue to create amazing moments and memories with great people.</p>

For years, many people have asked Shawn ""Why Don't You Own Your Own Bar?"" and he had many people offer to invest. But - the time wasn't right.
Now, we have a rock solid concept we have been developing since late 2013, and we are ready to GO!
The concept is simple - A sexy, welcoming, affordable and unique bar with a Vintage flair. We are creating your home away from home - a place where you can meet friends, socialize with awesome people, enjoy great cocktails and food and where the staff know your name. This bar is all about EXPERIENCES. Great people and great times. We believe Life is nothing without Moments and Memories.
A friend recently told us ""You can not only call yourselves Entrepreneurs, Promoters, Artists......... But, another layer........ Light Spreaders, Joy Givers, Genuine People Partners and, HAPPINESS MAKERS!"".
It is our aim to make everyone who walks through our door feel SPECIAL.
Ever been turned away by a Door Bitch? Couldn't find free or reasonable parking or had your stuff stolen by Valet? Ever had your credit card double charged? Automatic gratuities on a 1-person tab? Ever been kicked off a table for a bottle buyer? Couldn't get on a guest list? Ever felt like you weren't cool enough?
Yeah, we think it sucks too. Hollywood has changed. We want to go back to the days where everyone has a place to go and feel welcome. We already have a name, a brand, a logo, an identity, a design idea, a menu, a team........ and we are now ready to start looking for the right location!
We have an amazing team on our side who understand our vision and are passionate, professional and unstoppable and we are looking for the right space to create our dream.   What We Need & What You Get We need seed money!
After 8 months of looking, we have now found some potential locations for our vision and the need the finances to get the wheels in motion.
We need $250,000 to get the project up and running. These funds will go towards:


Set up our LLC.
Purchase a business with a 47 license.
Transfer the Licenses and CUP's.
Paying for professional services ie. Appraiser, Building Inspector, Consultants, Legal Services etc.
Marketing/Advertising/PR.
Location Set up costs - Purchase Liquor, Food, Equipment etc.
Entertainment.
Staffing.

In return for your support, you'll get various Perks! Each Contributor will also go on the VIP mailing list and receive 'First Look' updates and progress reports as we make steps towards making our dream a reality. We'll keep you involved every step of the way and let you know how we are spending the funds!


  The Impact The Antonio's have an exceptional track record in bringing fun and successful events to venues across Los Angeles. Now, we want to revolutionize the experience of Los Angeles Nightlife and create a new standard in our own venue.
Our aim is to bring people together from all walks of life, all races, all cultures and create a warm environment where everyone feels at home. We want to offer affordable, quality eats and cocktails that don't blow your budget.

  Risks & Challenges The bar and restaurant industry is fraught with danger. Many, if not most, businesses in the industry in Los Angeles fail.
The pitfalls are ego, poor planning, lack of startup finances or overblown budgets, mis-direction, no identity, poorly trained staff, inferior quality, lack of passion, no marketing/PR, and not knowing what the hell you are doing.
We are acutely aware that this is not an easy venture. However - we are passionate about our business and about our friends and customers!! We have carefully crafted a vision over time that we believe meets the needs of our customers, and the 'missing' in the current market. We are HOLLYWOOD SIMPLIFIED...... taking it back to the basics.
Between Shawn and Alicia, we have the skill-set and experience to handle the usual pitfalls. Where we do not have the experience, we already have an expert team of people who have committed themselves to the project with us. We only have the best of the best running with us.
The challenge for us is finding a venue that suits our needs and is convenient/well suited to you, our friends and customers.
We are working with financial and business advisors to ensure we accurately budget and are prepared for every eventuality.... problems and hurdles will come up!
 BRING IT!

  Other Ways You Can Help We understand that it is a tough economy for everyone right now, but every dollar helps.
If Shawn has ever bought you a drink or dinner, got you a comp bottle/table, walked you into a LA or Vegas nightclub for free, hugged you when you are down, met your parents, been to your birthday party/wedding, listened to you when you needed an ear, given you advice, made you smile, made a difference for you in your life, let you sleep on his couch, bailed you out, thrown your birthday party, introduced you to your significant other, connected you with new friends, introduced you to your favorite celeb, got you into a club when you were underage (sorry!) or gone out of his way to make sure you have an amazing and memorable time........ will you please contribute to the Antonio DREAM?
Even if you can only spare $5, everything helps us to continue to create amazing memories with YOU, at a place we can all call home.
And if you absolutely cannot help us financially, PLEASE share our link with all your friends on Social Media! Pass a tin around your office and collect spare change for us! Have a baked goods sale! Get your kids to set up a Lemonade stand! Wash some cars in a bikini! Sell your stuff on Ebay!
Ha! 
Just kidding..... but seriously - please help us to continue to create amazing moments and memories with great people.
Thank you for being a part of our journey.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We continued to run our rehearsal space for 4 years longer, and sold online at the same time.  At the peak of the real estate boom, our landlord cancelled our lease and sold the building for a mega profit, and we were out of business.</p>
<p>Our business continued with a limited presence on line and still we sought  out specialty items for our clients, did a few installations, and consultations, but it was in 2010, after repeated requests and a change in the local market, we decided to reopen the store in Midtown Sacramento; where we flourished once before.  In 2011, we re-established our business and decided that we would dedicate ourselves to the working musician and the used instrument market; with hard to find instruments and parts, affordable alternatives, expedited repairs, and once again, meeting the needs of musicians.  </p>
<p><br/>We are still here after 3+ years but have completely outgrown the small shop we have occupied since then.  With this expansion, we hope to be here for the long term and continue our ""musician's family"" approach to business.  That's where you come in.......</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking to expand into a bigger space, increase our inventory, and update our repair benches to meet the growing needs of our business. This will require construction and remodeling of any building we find, to customize the space to meet our needs.   We would also need to cover moving expenses, deposits on the new space and a financial buffer while we inform our clientele of our new location. <br/><br/>We were too large for this space when we took it and we have a lot more inventory sitting in storage that wants to be set free to the public.  In addition, our clients have plenty of consignment items that we just don't have room for.    <br/><br/>We are more than happy to share our branded store merchandise and promotional items with all of those that contribute to our campaign, in the way of shirts, hats, and other cool Profound Sound swag.  We are also featuring ""I Support Local Music"" items as well.  All fine, quality items that you will be proud to wear and use.  <br/><br/>We are also offering an engineering workshop, and a personal visit from Santa to your holiday party for those that want to contribute at the executive levels.</p>

<li>In the 11 years we operated the first incarnation of our business, we hosted many up and coming bands in our rehearsal studios, recording studio, as well as providing necessary supplies and tools for their endeavors.  Bands from Sacramento used our services on their way up the ladder of success and that was our greatest accomplishment.  We provided tour support, and shipped necessary accessories directly to bands while on tour</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary Profound Sound was started in 1994 to utilize my education and background in sound reinforcement and recording engineering.  The building we settled on was too big for just a fledgling recording studio, so we opened a small musical instrument sales, repair and rental shop out front and ran the studio in the back.  We opened a rehearsal studio within a year of opening and we just continued to grow.  We were then located at 19th & S streets in Sacramento CAWe blossomed into a $500k business in less than 5 years, and served our community of musicians by doing things differently and meeting our customers needs.  When the major big box music store moved to town in 2000, we were impacted financially adversely for the following year; but it was on a personal level that ultimately made us decide to close up the brick and mortar shop, and take our business online.   
We continued to run our rehearsal space for 4 years longer, and sold online at the same time.  At the peak of the real estate boom, our landlord cancelled our lease and sold the building for a mega profit, and we were out of business.
Our business continued with a limited presence on line and still we sought  out specialty items for our clients, did a few installations, and consultations, but it was in 2010, after repeated requests and a change in the local market, we decided to reopen the store in Midtown Sacramento; where we flourished once before.  In 2011, we re-established our business and decided that we would dedicate ourselves to the working musician and the used instrument market; with hard to find instruments and parts, affordable alternatives, expedited repairs, and once again, meeting the needs of musicians.  
We are still here after 3+ years but have completely outgrown the small shop we have occupied since then.  With this expansion, we hope to be here for the long term and continue our ""musician's family"" approach to business.  That's where you come in.......   What We Need & What You Get We are looking to expand into a bigger space, increase our inventory, and update our repair benches to meet the growing needs of our business. This will require construction and remodeling of any building we find, to customize the space to meet our needs.   We would also need to cover moving expenses, deposits on the new space and a financial buffer while we inform our clientele of our new location. We were too large for this space when we took it and we have a lot more inventory sitting in storage that wants to be set free to the public.  In addition, our clients have plenty of consignment items that we just don't have room for.    We are more than happy to share our branded store merchandise and promotional items with all of those that contribute to our campaign, in the way of shirts, hats, and other cool Profound Sound swag.  We are also featuring ""I Support Local Music"" items as well.  All fine, quality items that you will be proud to wear and use.  We are also offering an engineering workshop, and a personal visit from Santa to your holiday party for those that want to contribute at the executive levels.

  The Impact
We have always striven to meet the needs of working musicians, by offering competitive pricing, free advice, and referrals when we don't have what they need.  This will obviously continue since it is what we are best at.  By helping us with this expansion, you are supporting a grassroots business that assists the local community, and fosters aspiring artists. 

In the 11 years we operated the first incarnation of our business, we hosted many up and coming bands in our rehearsal studios, recording studio, as well as providing necessary supplies and tools for their endeavors.  Bands from Sacramento used our services on their way up the ladder of success and that was our greatest accomplishment.  We provided tour support, and shipped necessary accessories directly to bands while on tour

Serendipity. Though syllables from that word sound like portions of ""Zippity-Doo-Dah"", a  song from Disney's Song of the South, the word means an occurrence or beneficial chance development. Zippity-Doo-Dah was covered by a few different bands, including the Kingsmen, Freddie and the Dreamers, Paula Abdul, and even the Jackson Five. And you know what bands need in order to cover songs? Instruments and equipment.  Of which Profound Sound has. It's not a huge store like Guitar Center or American Music.

Startup
Hackathon is an initiative of Student
Entrepreneurs inc. a not for profit organisation dedicated to fostering
innovation and entrepreneurship amongst tertiary students. After participating in 'Startup Camp 2008' (as run by Sydney entrepreneur Bart Jellema) and loving it, we thought there needs to be such an event run for students. And so 'Startup Hackathon' was borne! Since then we've run 3 Hackathons, each bigger and better than the last. With the 2011 edition attracting over 40 tech students from around Victoria, resulting in 13 web & mobile start-ups being deployed during the event.
We are Australiaâ€™s largest student-centric innovation and
entrepreneurship focused organisation. Founded in 2008 at the University
of Melbourne, we have since grown to over 1400 members, and are currently
expanding into universities across the country. We have fostered a number of
successful startups in the past, and hope that our Startup Hackathon events
will continue to grow, introducing more young people skilled with technology,
to the startup scene. 

What it is.
â€˜Startup
Hackathon' brings together teams of IT and design
students from universities around Victoria, launching web-based startups â€“ from
scratch â€“ in 48 hours. Each team will conceive and develop their idea over the
course of a weekend, and on the final day pitch their startups
to a group of Melbourneâ€™s leaders in the tech startup scene. 
The challenge: make something people want.
Students are aided with workshops to brainstorm ideas and business
models, working in teams to formulate an idea, then the race begins to design, develop and deploy their application
within the time constraints. 

The Impact
Our 'Startup Hackathon' events have received great success in the past, with contestants continuing to work on their startups post event, and integrating into the wider entrepreneurial community. Our goal for the event is to foster the community and introduce tech students to the startup scene. The connections, friends,
skills, and ideas that arise from our events give opportunities and ventures to
the budding and eagre students our event attracts. 

Startup Hackathon Melbourne
runs entirely on the goodwill and love from all who wish to
support young the next generation of Australian entrepreneurs!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Jolie Umstead and I am a 20 year old student at William Paterson University in New Jersey. In March of this past year, I went with my school to Lynchburg, Virginia to build a habitat home. <span style="""">Within
that one week of building, I fell in love with Habitat. The
experience enriched my life in so many ways; I expected to help a family and
gained much more for myself. I felt as though I had finally found my purpose,
my calling. The regulars called it ""feeling the feeling.""</span></p>
<p><br/>I came back from the trip determined to do more for Habitat, and within a month started a Habitat for Humanity club at my university. A few weeks ago I was offered an opportunity to build the 500,000th habitat home in the city of Maai Mahlu, Kenya. This could be the experience of a lifetime, but unfortunately the cost of the trip makes the opportunity out of reach for me. <b style=""""><span style='font-size: 16pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'></span></b><b style=""""><span style='font-size: 16pt; font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'></span></b></p>

<p>Harp &amp; Shamrock Croft, LLC, est. 2013, is simply on a journey to realize our dream with hard work and dedication anyone can accomplish what they set out to do. For us that dream was to start a farm.</p>
<p>We are a small family farm in the upstate of South Carolina with a mission of bringing local, fresh, and sustainable food to the community. What started out as a dream has become a successful reality. We are not experts by any means as we still have a lot to learn, but the excitement grows from mid-January on each year as we engage in farming by producing more great food. Our goal is to continue to expand in size and grow larger quantities of produce for the community to enjoy.</p>
<h2>The Campaign</h2>
<p>If we want to plant early enough to have fresh vegetables by the end of winter for our market and on-site customers, then we need to construct a much larger greenhouse (high tunnel) by early January. That's why we are coming to you.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511382287/g4vox20z80l5hedgd9s2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">(<i>a</i><i>n example of the greenhouse frame that was given to us</i>)</p>
<p>The new greenhouse would allow us to grow specifically in this structure while using our much smaller high tunnels as seed starting stations since we start all of our transplants by seed onsite. As a registered nursery we are licensed to sell plants, so you can imagine how quickly the space in these structures fills up. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510254823/nm9t7wfar3dnfhaita4t.jpg"" src=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510254903/oe2qdarohzsaxqsuqkwn.jpg"" src=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510254883/ehhjdvucqnnskreikxth.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">(<i>a</i><i> look inside one of our diy smaller high tunnels</i>)</p>
<p>The Campaign to complete the construction would help cover the costs for:</p>
<ul>
<li>6mil four-year plastic</li>
<li>End wall construction</li>
<li>Oversize door</li>
<li>Channels and springs to lock plastic </li>
<li>Side venting system</li>
<li>Remaining hardware</li>
<li>Labor</li>
</ul>
<p>The total cost for equipment and additional expenses to get the structure functional is <strong>$3,500</strong>.</p>
<p>You may ask yourself ""why should I give to this Campaign?"" It feels good to give; especially when the cause is to make people healthier and support a small family farm that has worked hard to build a reputation for success in just a short time. Any funds raised over this amount will be invested into the overall farm operation, so you can be assured your dollars will be spent wisely.</p>

<h3>What We Have Accomplished So Far In Our Short History</h3>
<p>So far Harp &amp; Shamrock Croft, LLC, has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 5,000 lbs of harvested food through November 1, 2017 (compared to 2,500 lbs in all of 2016)</li>
<li>Finished the on-farm store front to simplify customers' purchase of produce</li>
<li>Completed a successful inaugural year Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) through three eight-week seasons that provided fresh, weekly vegetable shares to over 150 people</li>
<li>Raised organic-fed, pasture-raised chickens for eggs to sell on-site and at local farmers' markets</li>
<li>Partnered with Hub City Farmers' Market to provide produce for their CSA Shares and Mobile Market to a more diverse demographic in areas classified as food deserts</li>
<li>Introduced and increased the number of visitors to the farm and provided more educational opportunities for farm work days</li>
<li>Engaged the surrounding community by hosting events on the farm to educate, entertain, and feed</li>
<li>
<i>Finally</i> Launched a YouTube channel focusing on gardening and homesteading tutorials</li>
</ul>
<p>We are a community-driven farm that thrives in knowing what we produce is making those healthier. In just a few short years, we have gone from just a few thousand square feet in growing space to an acre.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510253799/sjdvvwo0jghpmnnxdsku.jpg"" src=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510253817/guj5qurklkr07rrvm9uv.jpg"" src=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510253836/uxbapwcmgqauppv4u1ie.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact of Having A Larger Greenhouse</h2>
<p>Because we are small farm with limited space to expand on, the greenhouse would allow us to grow during the off season, but also extend our growing season as well. Simply, a greenhouse would allow us to grow year-around, save space, and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase quantity and availability of chemical-free produce for purchase onsite as well as during winter markets (we take great pride in our main farmers' market and work hard to bring a good variety of produce each week)</li>
<li>Use the success that we have achieved in growing in our smaller high tunnels to the next level</li>
<li>
<strong>Most importantly</strong>, the Campaign will permit us to avoid taking on any further debt</li>
</ul>

As a registered nursery we are licensed to sell plants, so you can imagine how quickly the space in these structures fills up. 
    
(a look inside one of our diy smaller high tunnels)
The Campaign to complete the construction would help cover the costs for:

6mil four-year plastic
End wall construction
Oversize door
Channels and springs to lock plastic 
Side venting system
Remaining hardware
Labor

The total cost for equipment and additional expenses to get the structure functional is $3,500.
You may ask yourself ""why should I give to this Campaign?"" It feels good to give; especially when the cause is to make people healthier and support a small family farm that has worked hard to build a reputation for success in just a short time. Any funds raised over this amount will be invested into the overall farm operation, so you can be assured your dollars will be spent wisely.

(breakdown of expenses that we hope the Campaign can help us reach)
Your generosity will be rewarded as we will give back, too. Please take a look at our Perks for various giving opportunities. We are happy to tailor these Perks to your needs as well. The Perks represent what we as a farm are all about and hope that you can see the value in supporting us.
We understand you want to give to a great cause. We believe concrete examples can help overcome any reservations. We will allow our accomplishments to attest to our success and worthiness of more investment by you and others who share our vision.  

What We Have Accomplished So Far In Our Short History
So far Harp & Shamrock Croft, LLC, has:

Approximately 5,000 lbs of harvested food through November 1, 2017 (compared to 2,500 lbs in all of 2016)
Finished the on-farm store front to simplify customers' purchase of produce
Completed a successful inaugural year Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) through three eight-week seasons that provided fresh, weekly vegetable shares to over 150 people
Raised organic-fed, pasture-raised chickens for eggs to sell on-site and at local farmers' markets
Partnered with Hub City Farmers' Market to provide produce for their CSA Shares and Mobile Market to a more diverse demographic in areas classified as food deserts
Introduced and increased the number of visitors to the farm and provided more educational opportunities for farm work days
Engaged the surrounding community by hosting events on the farm to educate, entertain, and feed

Finally Launched a YouTube channel focusing on gardening and homesteading tutorials

We are a community-driven farm that thrives in knowing what we produce is making those healthier. In just a few short years, we have gone from just a few thousand square feet in growing space to an acre.
    

The Impact of Having A Larger Greenhouse
Because we are small farm with limited space to expand on, the greenhouse would allow us to grow during the off season, but also extend our growing season as well. Simply, a greenhouse would allow us to grow year-around, save space, and:

Increase quantity and availability of chemical-free produce for purchase onsite as well as during winter markets (we take great pride in our main farmers' market and work hard to bring a good variety of produce each week)
Use the success that we have achieved in growing in our smaller high tunnels to the next level

Most importantly, the Campaign will permit us to avoid taking on any further debt

<p>Over a year and a half ago, my partner Kevin and I began working towards a zero waste lifestyle when we realized we were producing too much trash. In Waterloo Region, the average person produces 675 lbs of waste a year. That’s the weight of approximately 1,800 bananas plus 14,000 disposable coffee cups. Much of our waste consists of food packaging, food waste, and single-use disposables. <strong>Plastics are also a huge problem as they cannot truly be recycled, only downcycled</strong> into inferior quality products, and are left to contaminate the environment once they can no longer be recycled.</p> <p>Now, we have been able to drastically reduce the amount of waste we produce by making small changes to our habits. However, <strong>trying to source products free of packaging and plastic had us travelling to numerous outlets just to complete our groceries</strong>. Wanting a one-stop shop to help us reduce our waste, we founded Zero Waste Bulk, Waterloo’s first zero waste grocery store.</p>

<p><span>Our mission is to create a

<p><span>Spassyou. Com was born as a
“showcase”, a peer to peer between operators and users with the intent to
spread its net to a large number of people, in a way that each activity or

<p><span>Tourism changes 
perpetually. Lately, “travelers” are no more looking for package holidays, but
they are at the research of particular activities, like for example bird

appreciated by a huge amount of people.</span></p>
<p><span>And we’re talking about sports
and hobbies that would find their space in Spassyou.com, from the side of the
operator who offers activities, and from the other side, the user, that could
easily contact the operator to define his vacancies better.</span></p>
<p><span>The purpose of Spassyou is to
register a number of operators and users able to create a network of contacts,
in order to valorize the environments of the operators, giving voice to all
those activities which do not have particular visibility.</span></p>
<p><span>A portal that encases
everything we look for, in the right moment, is the perfect mean to organize a
custom holiday, for the seasonal tourist, and for who regularly lives in a
region, to discover all those activities that would be remaining in the shadow.</span></p>
<p>The project started two years ago, it has
come this far with a working portal, without any funding. That’s the reason why
the project is growing slowly.</p>
<p>We decided to ask for your help to speed
up the process of growth of Spassyou, and let everybody free to use the portal.</p>
<p>Our target is to raise money to make
technological improvements designed already, and spread the network through
marketing.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED TO GET WHAT</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Spassyou
is operating already in BETATEST version.</p>
<p>Even though the functions are minimized
now, the operator (that can be owner of a Surf School, or owner of a
restaurant, or whoever wants to advertise himself) can sign in and advertise
his activities completely for free, sharing offers and events.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the user can book the
activity, leave comments, send private texts, and other functions that enable
the user to use the portal as much as he can.</p>
<p>Functions and design of the website need
to be reviewed in order to have an easy and reliable use of the same.</p>
<p>We really need to develop an app for
Androids and IOS in a way that we can reach the average traveler that usually
uses his Smartphone/tablet for his researches.</p>
<p>In order to do so, we need money to pay
developers, get in touch with local societies, and sponsor Spassyou as best as
we can, whatever the entities financing would be, just to have a friendly use
of the website.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p>Since
the portal is up, the team of Spassyou has been around a lot of tourist areas,
looking for operators that could be interested to our project and the idea got
a positive feedback.</p>
<p>The possibility to advertise activities in
a showcase for local tourist and tourist from abroad, really caught the
attention of the operators.</p>
<p><span>Spassyou wants to offer to
operators and users the chance to organize their vacancies step by step, to be
always updated on what’s happening around without losing sight of the social
side, in order to share reviews and helpful advices.</span></p>
<p><span>We are absolutely sure that the
use of the portal will stimulate the local tourism, discovering activities that
without Spassyou, would still be in silence.</span></p>
<p><span>It would be a very important
instrument for event organizers, because it permits to print the list of
participants, in PDF document, breaking down the costs of cards, or paper
marketing.</span></p>
<p>The assumption is excellent, and we’re
only getting positive feedback from our ideas.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>Spassyou
was born completely for free and it will always be.</p>
<p>Monetize is important, but for us, the
revival of tourism it’s more, and our idea is to do it in areas that have a lot
to offer but don’t have the right instruments to advertise what they offer.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is to point out how
important tourism is for a region and make the people happy to appreciate their
activities through our portal. If they are operators or users, it doesn’t
really matter.</p>
<p>EVERYBODY can sign in on Spassyou and give
a contribution, even just commenting activities that you like the most.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>HOW TO HELP US</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A
small financial contribution would help us finishing our project, which Is
already two years old.</p>
<p><span>The creation of the portal can
be helpful for everybody: for operators, in order to increase their visibility
and for users to know better the places they live in.</span></p>
<p>We
thank you so much.</p>

we can, whatever the entities financing would be, just to have a friendly use
of the website.

THE IMPACT
Since
the portal is up, the team of Spassyou has been around a lot of tourist areas,
looking for operators that could be interested to our project and the idea got
a positive feedback.
The possibility to advertise activities in
a showcase for local tourist and tourist from abroad, really caught the
attention of the operators.
Spassyou wants to offer to
operators and users the chance to organize their vacancies step by step, to be
always updated on what’s happening around without losing sight of the social
side, in order to share reviews and helpful advices.
We are absolutely sure that the
use of the portal will stimulate the local tourism, discovering activities that
without Spassyou, would still be in silence.
It would be a very important
instrument for event organizers, because it permits to print the list of
participants, in PDF document, breaking down the costs of cards, or paper
marketing.
The assumption is excellent, and we’re
only getting positive feedback from our ideas.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
Spassyou
was born completely for free and it will always be.
Monetize is important, but for us, the
revival of tourism it’s more, and our idea is to do it in areas that have a lot
to offer but don’t have the right instruments to advertise what they offer.
Our biggest challenge is to point out how
important tourism is for a region and make the people happy to appreciate their
activities through our portal. If they are operators or users, it doesn’t
really matter.
EVERYBODY can sign in on Spassyou and give
a contribution, even just commenting activities that you like the most.

HOW TO HELP US

A
small financial contribution would help us finishing our project, which Is
already two years old.
The creation of the portal can
be helpful for everybody: for operators, in order to increase their visibility
and for users to know better the places they live in.
We
thank you so much.

<h3>Our four year old son wants to help victims of Hurricane Sandy. </h3>
<p>On Tuesday, October 30th, we sat with our son and looked at pictures of the destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy. Without prompting, he said he wanted to help and would give the money from his piggy bank to people who lost their homes. We were very lucky, suffering no damage to our home.</p>
<p>We thought you and your children might want to help by giving the money from your piggy banks as well. </p>

update: Tuesday 10/30/12: Send your family or child's photo after you contribute and we'll add it to the gallery.
Our four year old son wants to help victims of Hurricane Sandy. 
On Tuesday, October 30th, we sat with our son and looked at pictures of the destruction caused by Hurricane Sandy. Without prompting, he said he wanted to help and would give the money from his piggy bank to people who lost their homes. We were very lucky, suffering no damage to our home.
We thought you and your children might want to help by giving the money from your piggy banks as well. 


The Goal
We're hoping to raise $1,000 in the next ten days to donate to the following charities. And we hope children across the country will join E in acts of charity to help other kids their age and members of their communities.
We're going to split the money between:

The American Red Cross
Feeding America
Humane Society Disaster Relief Fund

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Every great city relies on a strong foundation; innovators, inventors and the creative class. We believe the arts strongly contribute to this vision and our plan is to expose, highlight and celebrate the few willing to make these great ideas a reality. As fellow contributors, our dream has always been to provide a type of space to allow future ideas to grow and flourish; just as others have inspired us. We are both Douglas Anderson alumni and have been a part of the local music and arts scene for the past 16 years, setting up and performing in countless live events, contributing to local charities and, in general, keeping the urban core vibrant. We intend to make this space riverside's living room. A meeting place to exchange ideas, to network and to learn from eachother. Invest in us and we'll invest in our city's future. </p>
<h3>In exchange for your contribution</h3>

<div>
<p>We almost made it, but still need your help! Due to unforseen repairs to equipment, hefty city costs and dreams bigger than our budget, we have fallen slightly short of our vision. By investing in us you'll help us with the stage and audio equipment, an espresso machine and the tools to build a community bookshelf. In celebration of our opening we are offering a one time mug club deal, ""The Chihuahuah"" for six months, or ""The Great Dane"" for a year. After this fundraiser ends, there will be no more memebers. Take advantage of this offer before it ends and be a part of our future.</p>

<p>A blank canvas is just a piece of material, let's do something with it. After art school and/or college, whether we chose to pursue our dreams or found that life just doesn't have the plan for us that we did, expression shouldn't die with time or hopelessness. It should be open to all those who have the passion and the need for it in our lives. By helping out, you can give them that opportunity. A true public gallery.</p>

<h3>Fargo Makerworks - A Makerspace in Fargo, ND</h3>
<p>A gym membership for makers, do'ers and innovators. That's what Fargo Makerworks is. I started researching technology like 3D printer, laser cutters, CNC machines, Arduino, etc. All of these things sounded very cool, but they're very expensive. (For example, the CNC router is $20,000.) Also, it wouldn't make sense to buy something that advanced if I would only be using it for an hour or two a day; it makes much more sense to have others able to access it as well.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ZROT0-gdMM8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">look at this laser cutter in action!</a></p>
<p>I'll bet that you already have some great ideas in mind for what you could make with this! I looked in Fargo to see if anything existed that would allow access to all of these fascinating tools.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>While I was searching, I asked quite a few people if they knew of anything in the area. While they said they didn't, nearly all of them mentioned that they wished that there was. I'd ask them what they wanted to make, and the answers were as varied as the people themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scan and print a 3D model of yourself</li>
<li>Unique jewelry designs</li>
<li>Engraved wedding gifts</li>
<li>Robotics projects</li>
<li>Model railroad buildings</li>
<li>Architectural models</li>
<li>3D printed topographical maps</li>
<li>Unique tabletop gaming models</li>
<li>Product prototypes</li>
<li>and the list could go on and on...</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to all of the <strong>things</strong> people wanted to make, there were also many who wanted to learn new <strong>skills</strong>. There will be project-based classes that will incorporate the different pieces of equipment so that not only can you understand how it works, but you'll be able to understand <strong>why</strong> you might want to use it in the first place!</p>
<p>What if you have an idea for something to make, but you just don't have the <strong>time</strong> to spend in the shop yourself to be running the machines or turning your sketch into a 3D model? Don't worry, Makerworks will be providing a service to fill that need as well.</p>
<h3>What will be in the shop?</h3>
<p>There will be a variety of equipment, and this is not a comprehensive list, but just a list of the equipment that should be there on Day 1.</p>
<p><strong>Epilog Laser 50w Laser cutter/engraver 24"" x 18""</strong></p>

<div>
<p>To make this happen, I need to make sure that I'll be able to keep the doors open for the first few months while the membership base becomes solid and consistent. If this project exceeds its goal, I'll be able to add more equipment more quickly and it will allow me the flexibility to purchase multiple of an item if the demand for it is limiting other members from using it.</p>
<ul>
<li>$5,000 is the goal. This will help ensure the doors will be able to stay open until everything is settled in.</li>
<li>If the goal is not met, it will just take a longer to fully open up Makerworks to the public.</li>
<li>If the campaign blows past the goal, then I'll be turning to the backers and asking what other equipment they want to see in the space. Have something in mind already?

<p>We are Rebecca (Beccaboo) &amp; Kimberley (Kimblebee) and together we make Beccaboo’s &amp; Kimblebee’s!</p>
<p>We are sisters and together with our Mother (Mama Bear) we are hoping to open our own little store!</p>
<h3>
<strong>Beccaboo’s &amp; Kimblebee’s is a florist, gift &amp; home décor store.</strong> Let me tell you a little more…</h3>
<p>Rebecca is a florist and Kimberley is a lover of all things creative and nifty. She has travelled around the world, picking up knowledge of business along the away, especially when she volunteered in a home décor and real estate office in Canada for a year. As she was doing this, she picked up a love of renovating furniture and upcycling items that are no longer loved. This brings us neatly to our next point.</p>
<p>We want to create a store that has everything you will need for gift giving under one roof. At present we are running the florist on Facebook and you can see our page here – <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/beccaboosandkimblebees"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/beccaboosandkimblebees</a></p>
<p>At the moment we are offering flowers and have had recent success with Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day and have decided to branch out a little further, delving into the world of homemade beauty products and also silver jewellery to our collection of gifts.</p>
<h3><strong>Our goal is to have a store that incorporates the following:</strong></h3>
<p>We want to offer a professional yet unique and quirky florist service to the local community, with everything to do with gift-giving also available under one roof. There will be homemade beauty products and silver jewellery that will be incorporated with our flowers for occasions such as new baby, weddings, mother’s day, Valentine’s Day, birthdays, anniversaries, etc. We also offer a range of funeral and bereavement flowers, and will be offering <strong>free delivery</strong> to the local Medway towns.</p>
<p>We would like our store to have a <strong>candy theme</strong>. For example, we have come up with the following promotions for various flower-giving events throughout the year:</p>
<p><strong>*Mother’s Day Menu!</strong></p>
<p>You have three courses – starter, main course and desert. The starter will be a Mother’s Day card of your choice, locally hand made by Kimberley’s “mother-in-law”. The main course will be a bouquet – either a box style bouquet, a gift bag style bouquet, or a hand-tied aqua-bubble style bouquet. The desert will be a choice of a selection of gifts, including jewellery, homemade beauty products, photo frames and albums, etc.</p>
<p>All of these will be for a set price – to be confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>*The Birthday Banquet!</strong></p>
<p>This will follow the same idea as the above – starter, main course and desert.</p>
<p>The reason that we want a candy-themed store is because we want to offer “retro” bouquets for events such as birthdays and anniversaries. For example, we want to offer very unique gift ideas that include a selection of “retro” candies with a matching bouquet of flowers. Just one of the examples that we have come up with is a cute displayed box of “fried egg” style sweets with a yellow and white bouquet to match the colour scheme. Everyone loves candy, right?</p>
<p>All of our flyers will be set out in a menu-style design and we also want to work with other businesses in the local community, for example restaurants and cafes, to add vouchers with our gifts and flowers. We are currently in discussions with a local restaurant to offer a money-off voucher when a customer spends over a certain amount so that they can eat in that restaurant. This is a great idea for birthdays, mother’s day and Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>Moving along into the world of homemade beauty products and we are branching out to include New Mother style packages that will include a new baby bouquet of flowers (again you can see our Facebook page for an idea) and also pamper ideas such as homemade and organic bath products for the new mother to pamper herself. When a new baby is born, people tend to buy gifts for the baby and we want the mother to feel special too!! We want to branch out and have a small selection of locally created baby items too – we are working with another local business woman who has started her own business creating diaper/nappy cakes and similar items.</p>
<p>Moving on to the home decor side of things and every display in our store is going to be vintage, shabby chic style recycled/upcycled furniture. All of the furniture that we will use for our displays is going to be for sale. We want to try and be as economically friendly as possible and we are going to show customers how they can use their imagination to recreate beautiful items for their home for a fraction of the price. For example, we will be using spray-painted cans as vintage and shabby chic vases. Just one idea that we have tried and people seem to love!</p>
<p>We are also going to be selling frames and photo albums in our store and eventually, we are thinking of perhaps incorporating a photo-printing machine so that people can print out their photos to give as gifts alongside our flowers, jewellery, bath products, etc.</p>
<p>A lot of the flowers and foliage that we are going to be using in our bouquets, we will be growing ourselves to avoid the use of pesticides, etc. In short, we want to be as self sufficient and eco-friendly as we can be!</p>

<p>We have found two stores in the local town that we are considering using (one of) as our little store. The town currently doesn’t have a florist in the parade of shops. There is a convenience store, post office, bakery, clothing boutique and a number of other smaller stores, but no florist, gift, home decor or jewellery store. This parade of shops is in a local community and is also on a school run – the kids are bound to love the candies that we want to offer!</p>
<p>Your funding will go towards setting us up in the store – it will help to pay for rent, overheads and stock. We have been fairly successful so far and have been running our business, basically from home, for around 4-6 months. We appreciate that flowers tend to boom on certain days of the year - mother’s day, Valentine’s Day, etc. and that is why we are offering other items such as gifts, home decor, etc. We are also considering adorning our walls with art work from local artists to sell as well.</p>
<p>With your help, we will pay our first 4-5 months rent, bills, buy stock – flowers, jewellery, ingredients for the homemade beauty products, etc. We will be purchasing second hand furniture to renovate as well as tills, signs for our store, vinyls for our vehicles and other costs associated with starting up a business.</p>
<h3><strong>In short, you will be making a very big dream come true. </strong></h3>

<p>Thank you so much for reading! We love you all!</p>
<p>Beccaboo &amp; Kimblebee xoxo</p></div>","Hello guys & girls! 
We are Rebecca (Beccaboo) & Kimberley (Kimblebee) and together we make Beccaboo’s & Kimblebee’s!
We are sisters and together with our Mother (Mama Bear) we are hoping to open our own little store!

Beccaboo’s & Kimblebee’s is a florist, gift & home décor store. Let me tell you a little more…
Rebecca is a florist and Kimberley is a lover of all things creative and nifty. She has travelled around the world, picking up knowledge of business along the away, especially when she volunteered in a home décor and real estate office in Canada for a year. As she was doing this, she picked up a love of renovating furniture and upcycling items that are no longer loved. This brings us neatly to our next point.
We want to create a store that has everything you will need for gift giving under one roof. At present we are running the florist on Facebook and you can see our page here – www.facebook.com/beccaboosandkimblebees
At the moment we are offering flowers and have had recent success with Valentine’s Day and Mother’s Day and have decided to branch out a little further, delving into the world of homemade beauty products and also silver jewellery to our collection of gifts.
Our goal is to have a store that incorporates the following:
We want to offer a professional yet unique and quirky florist service to the local community, with everything to do with gift-giving also available under one roof. There will be homemade beauty products and silver jewellery that will be incorporated with our flowers for occasions such as new baby, weddings, mother’s day, Valentine’s Day, birthdays, anniversaries, etc. We also offer a range of funeral and bereavement flowers, and will be offering free delivery to the local Medway towns.
We would like our store to have a candy theme. For example, we have come up with the following promotions for various flower-giving events throughout the year:
*Mother’s Day Menu!
You have three courses – starter, main course and desert. The starter will be a Mother’s Day card of your choice, locally hand made by Kimberley’s “mother-in-law”. The main course will be a bouquet – either a box style bouquet, a gift bag style bouquet, or a hand-tied aqua-bubble style bouquet. The desert will be a choice of a selection of gifts, including jewellery, homemade beauty products, photo frames and albums, etc.
All of these will be for a set price – to be confirmed.
*The Birthday Banquet!
This will follow the same idea as the above – starter, main course and desert.
The reason that we want a candy-themed store is because we want to offer “retro” bouquets for events such as birthdays and anniversaries. For example, we want to offer very unique gift ideas that include a selection of “retro” candies with a matching bouquet of flowers. Just one of the examples that we have come up with is a cute displayed box of “fried egg” style sweets with a yellow and white bouquet to match the colour scheme. Everyone loves candy, right?
All of our flyers will be set out in a menu-style design and we also want to work with other businesses in the local community, for example restaurants and cafes, to add vouchers with our gifts and flowers. We are currently in discussions with a local restaurant to offer a money-off voucher when a customer spends over a certain amount so that they can eat in that restaurant. This is a great idea for birthdays, mother’s day and Valentine’s Day.
Moving along into the world of homemade beauty products and we are branching out to include New Mother style packages that will include a new baby bouquet of flowers (again you can see our Facebook page for an idea) and also pamper ideas such as homemade and organic bath products for the new mother to pamper herself. When a new baby is born, people tend to buy gifts for the baby and we want the mother to feel special too!!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our beautiful daughter, Elena Inez Sibley, was diagnosed with hypotonia just before turning one year old.  She was unable at that time to push herself up to sitting, bear weight in her legs, or crawl, even on her tummy.  She has also had difficulty with chewing and swallowing textured foods.  She is now 21 months old and has been in physical and occupational therapy for the past eight months, and will continue to need this support as she grows and develops her movement.  She also may need continued appointments with infant development specialists, neurologists and other specialists, as well as will require orthopedic support in order to learn how to walk.       </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our insurance has an enormous yearly deductible, plus thousands of dollars of additional out-of-pocket fees for services such as PT and OT, and orthotics are not covered even after all that has been met.  Because of this, we are currently trying to pay off 2012 hospital bills while incurring nearly another $10,000 in medical bills this year.  Although our options for medical insurance may be changing in the future with the arrival of Obamacare, our current expenses will not be retroactively covered, and at this time we are struggling to make even the minimal payments on our existing bills, or to have the resources necessary for the continued support that Elena needs.  </p>
<p>Elena will soon be fitted for AFO's, (ankle and foot braces), to support her ankles as she begins to gain strength and moves towards learning to walk. We would also like to be able to offer her occupational therapy in addition to the currently once a week physical therapy sessions that she receives.  Our campaign is intended to cover these above costs specificially, as well as any additional support that Elena may need throughout the year, such as appointments with an osteopathic or anthroposophical doctor, and any additional neurologic, genetic or metabolic testing that comes up and is not covered by our insurance.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I have to explain why my toddler can't walk or eat normally for her age, most people say, ""Hypotonia?  What is that?""  Hypotonia, or low muscle tone, seems to be more prevalent than it once may have been, as is the case with many dissabilities and challenges that children today are facing.  There is often no known cause for hypotonia, and if there is one to be discovered, there is a lengthy and difficult process of neurologic, metabolic and genetic testing to go through.  Physical and occuaptional therapies are the most effective and important ways in which to address hypotonia, whatever the cause or prognosis, and orthotic support can enable a child with hyptonoia to walk more safely and steadily once they are able.  By contributing to our campaign, you will be supporting Elena's development through funding the most effective support avaialble to her. </p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't financially support Elena's progress, please pass the word on about our campaign!  We are so grateful that she is making progress, and would like people to become aware of hypotonia and the therapies that can assist it, which can make an enormous difference in a child's life.  </p>

<p>Now, at the age of 30, I am making that asipration come true earlier thanks to African Markets Internship Programs (AMIP) granted by The Tony Elumelu Foundation (TEF). As a successful candidate for Corhot II of AMIP 2013, I am very proud and thrilled to accept the internship offer to work for Nigeria Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in Abuja within 10 weeks between 5 July and 15 September. In the internship, I will carry out research in the areas of economics, law, and finance related to the capital market and the Nigerian economy, and also assit Nigerian SEC in analysing financial data for leading and lagging purpose.</p>
<p>Africa is always a region in my aspiration to discover facets of the continent and to help for driving its developments either in economy or in other sectors. The internship to Nigeria would open a new chapter in my life after my MBA graduation. However, I am facing TWO CHALLENGES that make me run this campaign to ask for your supports to achieve the goal of $3000 for the internship trip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CHALLENGE 1: A ROUND-TRIP FLIGHT TICKET</strong></p>
<p>Since the visa costs and round trip travel ticket to Nigeria are not covered while I cannot afford to pay for very costly travel expenses, this may turn down the AMIP opportunity. I am hoping to receive TEF's travel scholarship, but the chance is limited. So I want to try my best efforts to secure additional funding to enable me participate in this program.  </p>

<p>I take the above statement from Tony Elumelu, the founder of the AMIP program as a challenge because I want to prove that Africans are not alone on their path to develop a better Africa. Ones who also share the same vision about a positive and promising future for the continent would want to support his idea. I believe that you are the ones.

This is the 1st artistic space project made by artists, engineers and scientists, wait, this is the 1st artistic satellite EVER!!!!

If we can reach space, we can say, for sure that we can reach anything we want to. It is a great message for everyone.
 Ulises I also works to establish a better model of how citizens can use science, from a population re-appropriating technology for their own benefit to the establishment of a plural work system and team-based success.
¿Cómo puede Ulises I transformar al mundo?
Es el 1er proyecto espacial artístico realizado por artistas, ingenieros y científicos, espera, es el 1er proyecto artístico satelital!!!!
Si podemos alcanzar el espacio, podemos estar seguros de que podremos alcanzar todo lo que deseamos. Es un mensaje claro para todos.

Many clients come to me [secretly] knowing that it's time for any of the following to manifest: a new job or career path, a deepened understanding and expression of their sexuality, creativity, or spirituality, a renaissance of joy, a feeling of freedom, or a trust that they can <strong>love themselves</strong>, just as is.

Introduction
Hello Indiegogo. We are a small, independent web development and design team named LuminoCityGroup. Since LuminoCityGroup started, our primary goal has always been to work in the education industry providing software that will enhance the experience of students, faculty and staff at these institutions.
SaferGrounds addresses one of the primary concerns that we see in the education industry today: safety. In the US, college campuses in particular have fallen prey to various crimes and these institutions are continuously struggling with how to resolve this issue. In the past, most institutions have placed ""emergency posts"" around their campuses in order to allow students to call for security by pressing a button. While these posts are beneficial, the inherent flaw becomes obvious when a crime happens and one is not within reach of the student. In most cases, this means the student will unfortunately be left to fend for themselves.
This issue does not have to exist. With the quickly advancing devices that are in 55% of the average college student's pocket, SaferGrounds believes that we can resolve this issue. 
While there are products out there that do things similar to what we aspire to do, they tend to either cost a large amount of money to the students or the institutions that utilize them. We want to provide a cheap, hosted, powerful and integrated alternative that will work with these various institutions' existing infrastructures to provide the members of their communities with a new sense of safety. 

Where We Are Now & What We Plan To Do
We have already made a significant amount of progress towards creating our application, and we have basic mobile apps for both both iOS and Android devices; But we want to enhance these applications. In their current iterations, the users log in one time using their institution's chosen login method and then any time after they login that they launch the app they are presented with a single, practically full screen button that they would press to trigger the alert process. This would then fire off a notification to the security staff at the campus via (currently) a web interface that shows their realtime position on a map. The security dispatcher can then send an official to their location as soon as possible to resolve any issues that may be occurring. 
 
Where We Want To Go 
But that isn't where our ideas stop. We are also looking into many other additions to our current development plan, including features such as allowing SMS reports from students that will also populate the system, phone calls to notify security officials alongside the web interface and the ability for institutions to send out push notifications (via both SMS and the application) if the need arises. We also recognize that there are often visitors to these campuses who may also want to have the application. SaferGrounds would like to take this into account by offering users of the app who are from another institution “guest” access to the institution's security network. This means that if the user's institution had SaferGrounds and they were visiting another SaferGrounds campus, they would be able to send notifications to that campus instead of the campus they are originally from. One of the features we are most excited to offer is a collection of API endpoints that we will allow institutions to implement into their existing mobile applications so that their users do not need to download and maintain two separate apps. However, Institutions that do not want to implement our service into their existing apps can just instruct their users to download our separate application which will be conveniently available in the various app stores. 
 
But...
Unfortunately, we do not have the funds necessary to release our product.  And that's why we've turned to you. There is a lot of paperwork, legal fees, marketing costs, development hours, space costs, bandwidth and server costs and many other costs associated with getting this product reliably out the door and in the hands of the institutions. The goal we've requested covers these costs and will allow us to operate while we work on attracting more attention to our product.
 
We Need Your Help!

LuminoCityGroup, and the SaferGrounds project, are set on making sure that this product isn't all about making money - we want to better the world of education. Our price for the product once we release clearly reflects this idea. Instead of looking for outside investors who would alter that goal, we're turning to Indiegogo for assistance in securing the funds required to cover the charges we're encountering that are blocking us from continuing with our project. We've already invested some of our own money trying to get it started, but it wasn't enough for all of the costs associated with releasing a product of the caliber we desire.  
We realize that our business model doesn't have many perks that we can directly hand to you since it's a software meant for institutions. We've tried to come up with some interesting perks that we think you'll enjoy anyway. 
 
When We'd Like to Launch
Ideally, we'd like to launch the SaferGrounds beta this fall and the final product in the Spring of next year. This will allow for enough time for us to work out any bugs and also give various institutions time to consider us before their fall semesters start by using the summer as their testing time. If we get more funding than our goal, we'll be able to bring additional talented staff onto our team and complete the project more quickly.

<b>El Lagartillo's Story</b><br/>
</h4><p>El Lagartillo is a small, rural community
in Nicaragua that was attacked by the Contra army in the mid-1980s. This
resilient community has devoted the past several decades to rebuilding their
revered land and transforming it into a stable living and working environment.
Their newest dream is to purchase a plot of land a short walk from the
community center that can be reforested and remodeled in ways that will
generate new sources of income for the community members.  A foreign investor recently expressed interest
in buying this same land and converting it into a private home, threatening El
Lagartillo’s vision for self-sufficiency. </p>
<p>In total, this land costs $15,000. The
community of El Lagartillo has pooled its resources and raised a third of the
cost on its own ($5,000). Now, for the remaining $10,000, they seek the help from friends,
previous visitors, and others who are inspired by their story to secure this
land and create the promise for a prosperous future. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1414076/files/20150425092222-IMG_0777.JPG?1429978942"" src="""" style=""width: 493px; height: 370px;""/></p><h4>About Hijos del Maiz  </h4><p>All donations will go directly to Hijos del Maiz, an independent community-run organization and Spanish school that was formed in El Lagartillo in the early 2000s to offer jobs in the community and encourage cultural exchange. Hijos del Maiz has since ran many successful projects; from hosting and teaching hundreds of language students to securing solar panels for community members to helping arrange scholarships for local students to purchasing a pick-up truck to provide transportation of people and goods to nearby communities. The organization, which is comprised completely of locals and their families, includes Spanish teachers, a full-time staff and many other community members who regularly host foreign students and participate in community projects. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1414105/files/20150425093134-banner.jpg?1429979494"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h4>A Sustainable Future</h4><p></p><p>Hijos del Maiz has long-dreamed of buying this pristine land adjacent to 
their community, which includes many acres of deforested land and a 
secluded waterfall. After buying the land (<i>with your help!!</i>), Hijos del 
Maiz plans to include the community in reforesting this land, restoring 
the ecological diversity it once hosted, using permaculture techniques 
to provide food for the community, and building ecolodges for visitors 
to enjoy the incredible scenary and waterfall. </p>Visitors from all over the world have been awed and inspired by this resilient community, which has overcome diversity and found innovative ways to build a sustainable way of life. <br/><br/>El Lagartillo welcomes all to help them in their quest to build their future!

land and create the promise for a prosperous future. About Hijos del Maiz  All donations will go directly to Hijos del Maiz, an independent community-run organization and Spanish school that was formed in El Lagartillo in the early 2000s to offer jobs in the community and encourage cultural exchange. Hijos del Maiz has since ran many successful projects; from hosting and teaching hundreds of language students to securing solar panels for community members to helping arrange scholarships for local students to purchasing a pick-up truck to provide transportation of people and goods to nearby communities. The organization, which is comprised completely of locals and their families, includes Spanish teachers, a full-time staff and many other community members who regularly host foreign students and participate in community projects. A Sustainable FutureHijos del Maiz has long-dreamed of buying this pristine land adjacent to 
their community, which includes many acres of deforested land and a 
secluded waterfall. After buying the land (with your help!!), Hijos del 
Maiz plans to include the community in reforesting this land, restoring 
the ecological diversity it once hosted, using permaculture techniques 
to provide food for the community, and building ecolodges for visitors 
to enjoy the incredible scenary and waterfall. Visitors from all over the world have been awed and inspired by this resilient community, which has overcome diversity and found innovative ways to build a sustainable way of life. El Lagartillo welcomes all to help them in their quest to build their future! Stay tuned for updates as the campaign progresses.  ___________________________________________________________________________

for One Year </b></p>
<p><b>For months each year I go daily
to several Bangkok prisons to bear witness to foreigner inmates (from Canada,
US, Europe, Middle East, etc.) who experience the acute loneliness, emotional
pain, and spiritual distress of long-term overseas incarceration in a Thai
prison, away from the support of their friends and family. I bring
conversation, food, emotional support, laughter, human connection, providing a
critical life-line to these isolated people and re-connecting them to the web
of humanity.  </b></p>
<p><b>In November 2013, I will return
to Bangkok prisons to reach out to those suffering. I need funding to do this
work for this next year.</b></p>
<p>
<b style=""""><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ""Andale Mono""; color: #973393;'>MY PURPOSE:</span></b>  No one should have to endure the extremely
long sentences and dehumanizing conditions of Thai prisons. We all deserve to
be treated with dignity, humanity, no matter who we are. </p>
<p>

 My name is Heather
Luna-Rose. I am a social justice activist, single mom, founder of non-profit Luna-Rose Prisoner Support. I'm a passionate
advocate of marginalized people and the marginalized voices in all of us. I’ve
worked in violence prevention, and I hold a BA in Psychology &amp; Women’s
Studies, a M. Ed, and a post-graduate in Humanitarian Action &amp; Conflict.
This unpaid mission I have undertaken for eight years is my soul's work -- I cannot let people be abandonned or forgotten.</p>
<p>
<b><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ""Andale Mono""; color: #973393;'>WHY I DO THIS:</span></b>  Many of us suffer in prisons of fear, violence, mental illness,
addiction, as well as physical prisons. A survivor of many forms of violence,
I spent many years struggling in depression, loneliness, despair and now I
reach out with loving kindness to others discarded.</p>
<p>
<b><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ""Andale Mono""; color: #973393;'>THE IMPACT:</span></b>  Visiting wounded
and marginalized people and reflecting back their inherent worth brings a spark
of light, joy and hope to very dark places. Engaging inmates in compassion,
respect and dignity has transformational effects in institutions built only for
degradation and punishment. </p>
<p>As well as
seeing unspeakable pain and suffering in those prisons, and the human capacity
for depraved degradation and horror, I also witness the beauty and
resilience of the human spirit and the transformational effects of reaching out
in kindness and humanity.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Most of us want make a difference
in the world, we just don’t always know how. Or we feel powerless to in the
face of so much that is broken or unjust. We all have it within us to shape our
world as we want it to be: one of love, hope, kindness, justice. When we lead
from the heart, we re-connect ourselves and each other to our common humanity.</p>
<p> I have the skills and ability to hold compassionate space in
very dark places. I have the passion and commitment to do this work -- I can't

for One Year 
For months each year I go daily
to several Bangkok prisons to bear witness to foreigner inmates (from Canada,
US, Europe, Middle East, etc.) who experience the acute loneliness, emotional
pain, and spiritual distress of long-term overseas incarceration in a Thai
prison, away from the support of their friends and family. I bring
conversation, food, emotional support, laughter, human connection, providing a
critical life-line to these isolated people and re-connecting them to the web
of humanity.  
In November 2013, I will return
to Bangkok prisons to reach out to those suffering. I need funding to do this
work for this next year.

MY PURPOSE:  No one should have to endure the extremely
long sentences and dehumanizing conditions of Thai prisons. We all deserve to
be treated with dignity, humanity, no matter who we are. 

WHO I AM: 



 My name is Heather
Luna-Rose. I am a social justice activist, single mom, founder of non-profit Luna-Rose Prisoner Support. I'm a passionate
advocate of marginalized people and the marginalized voices in all of us. I’ve
worked in violence prevention, and I hold a BA in Psychology & Women’s
Studies, a M. Ed, and a post-graduate in Humanitarian Action & Conflict.
This unpaid mission I have undertaken for eight years is my soul's work -- I cannot let people be abandonned or forgotten.

WHY I DO THIS:  Many of us suffer in prisons of fear, violence, mental illness,
addiction, as well as physical prisons. A survivor of many forms of violence,
I spent many years struggling in depression, loneliness, despair and now I
reach out with loving kindness to others discarded.

THE IMPACT:  Visiting wounded
and marginalized people and reflecting back their inherent worth brings a spark
of light, joy and hope to very dark places. Engaging inmates in compassion,
respect and dignity has transformational effects in institutions built only for
degradation and punishment. 
As well as
seeing unspeakable pain and suffering in those prisons, and the human capacity
for depraved degradation and horror, I also witness the beauty and
resilience of the human spirit and the transformational effects of reaching out
in kindness and humanity.

WHAT INMATES SAY: 



 Please read these letters inmates have written to me, explaining
what my visits mean, used with their permission: http://thailandprisonersupport.org/intheirwords/

HOW I HAVE FUNDED THIS: I've worked many many jobs (driven
taxi, been a tuna-fisher, waitressed, managed a hotel, landscaping, farm
labour, etc.) in Canada, sleeping on friend's couches, and saving every penny out of my own pocket to return each Fall to bring hope to inmates. This is not sustainable. I need to be funded. AND I need a salary.


I can't do this alone.  I NEED YOUR HELP! 



WE
CAN DO THIS TOGETHER! It is up to us to create the world we
want: one of Dignity, Justice, Hope, & Connection.

Most of us want make a difference
in the world, we just don’t always know how. Or we feel powerless to in the
face of so much that is broken or unjust. We all have it within us to shape our
world as we want it to be: one of love, hope, kindness, justice. When we lead
from the heart, we re-connect ourselves and each other to our common humanity.
 I have the skills and ability to hold compassionate space in
very dark places. I have the passion and commitment to do this work -- I can't
sustain this, unfunded. I need your help: I need your contribution. Please contribute to fund me for one year.
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WHERE THE MONEY
GOES:

These are some of the basic minimum
costs: 
1. Airfare from Vancouver to
Bangkok, visas, health & travel insurance: ($3000 for 3 months)
2. Transportation in Bangkok, to and from prisons and Embassies: ($700
monthly)
3.  Food for inmates: ($1000 monthly)
3. Accommodation: ($500 monthly)
4. Communication: wifi and phone ($400 monthly)
5. Office costs:  Office rental, mailbox rental, document
translation, photocopying, faxing, mailing, supplies ($1000/month)
7. Professional Support:  De-briefing, self-care and other
professional support services to mitigate the traumatic emotional load and
prevent burnout ($500 per month)
For now, let's get me there! To sustain this work, I also need to be paid. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* If we reach $15,000, this is a
start. to get me back to supporting inmates in November, 2013.
* If we reach $50,000, we fund my
work at the level required for six months bringing support, advocacy, and
hope to many inmates.
* IF WE REACH $100,000, this
funds Luna-Rose Prisoner Support's
work for one year: This means many more inmates in three prisons
receiving advocacy, hope, a connection to humanity, a voice, and visitors. I
can continue full-time to expand this mission making a positive difference in
many many people’s lives!
* $150,000- my work can continue
for longer and will fund my work on a documentary: I hope to meet with family
members in different countries who cannot visit their loved ones locked up in
Thailand, as well as meet ex-inmates to give voice to their stories.

SOME OF THE IMPACTS:
Every day I see transformations
from showing care and kindness. The ripple effects of joy and hope and light
are immeasurable for people with very little hope: 
One Australian inmate with

To help raise awareness of my
mission to bring hope to these people, I have put on prison art exhibits,
depositing money from the sales of their art into prisoners’ accounts to allow
them to purchase food, water, the necessities for survival, not provided by the prison. 
In 2010, I sold close to $3000 of art for
one Russian inmate from that exhibit. He asked me to send the money to his
mother in the Ukraine. When I saw him later that year, the change in this tough
Russians man’s posture, demeanour and sense of worth, to be able to contribute

</p><p>My name is Katie Clack and I am the owner of the
Boardroom Café on 84<sup>th</sup> and Aurora. My husband Jason moved his business, Motion Boardshop, to our
block on Aurora in 2010.  Right away we realized there was a lack of coffee and community gathering space in the neighborhood.  We extensively remodeled our building
and opened the Boardroom in August of 2011. The café is now
two and a half years old with a solid customer base, a full menu of tasty breakfast
burritos, paninis, soups and homemade baked goods.  It’s real, homemade food that uses
organic and locally sourced ingredients when possible.  <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/392085/files/20140224161917-kickstarter_image_1.jpg?1393287557"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>Since day one, our customers have asked
us to stay open later to offer dinner, beer and wine.  However with our small dining space and
kitchen we didn’t feel we could accommodate this request until now.</p>
<p>Our former neighbors, the Guitar Store, moved to the
opposite end of the block and vacated their space next to us.  We have signed the lease and have already
begun renovating the space.  We are building our own wood
fired pizza oven and will serve local microbrews on tap along with our favorite
wines.  We'll even have growlers to fill and take home with you.<br/></p><p></p><h3>Our Vision<br/>
</h3><p></p><p>Our goal is to create a
casual, family-friendly, neighborhood focused restaurant.  Currently, there is nothing like
it in the area, particularly on Aurora. 
There is a dense population in our neighborhood tucked between Phinney Ridge
and Greenlake, with no real sit-down food options.  In addition to pizza, we will also serve a variety of other items from our wood fired oven, along with an amazing weekend brunch and daily happy hour.  Mimosas and dutch babies anyone?   Here is a rough draft of our proposed menu without prices:</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/392045/files/20140224154400-boardroom_menu_final.jpg?1393285440"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>
With the additional space we'll also have room for live music from some of the wildly talented musicians at the guitar store, an open mic night, and even trivia.  We'll carve out a nice cozy spot for kids to play while their parents relax and watch the Seahawks or Mariners on one of our TVs.   <br/><br/>Don't worry, our current morning coffee service and famous breakfast burritos aren't going anywhere!  We are simply expanding on our business model.<br/><p></p><p></p><p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""5""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px;""><b></b></span></font></p><p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"" size=""5""><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/407928/files/20140303142353-Boardroom_Plan.pdf?1393885433"" src="""" style=""""/></b></font></p><p></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">How the Funds Will Be Used</span></p><p>Remodeling the space next to us is a large undertaking, but we've done it once before and we know how to stretch pennies to the max.  You can rest assured that every cent donated will be put to good use.  Just like we did with our current space, we will be doing 95% of the construction ourselves to save on build out costs (thanks to incredibly helpful friends, family members, and customers!) Your donations will go directly towards...<br/></p><ul>
<li>Permitting costs<br/>
</li>
<li>Construction materials<br/>
</li>
<li>Commercial kitchen equipment</li>
<li>Plumbing costs to add two new bathrooms<br/>
</li>
<li>Dining tables and chairs</li>
</ul><p>I know it sounds like a lot to ask for $50,000 but realistically, building out a restaurant is incredibly expensive.  We also have investors who are helping to make this project a reality, but we felt strongly about wanting to get the community involved as well so that our loyal supporters can say they were a part of bringing this dream to life.   Unlike with Kickstarter, we will still get all of the funds raised even if we do not meet our goal.</p><p>If we hit our goal, please don't stop there!  Any excess funds will be 
used towards a gelato maker and cold display case!  <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What's In It For You?<br/>
</h3><p>We have come up with some unique rewards to hook you up with in exchange for your contribution.  For all of you regulars who are already coming in multiple times a week, now is your chance to pay a little, and get a lot in return!  You can see all of them in detail on the right side of the screen.  It's important that you understand that every dollar counts!  <br/></p><ul>
<li>Store Gift certificates<br/>

<li>Lattes or coffee for a year<br/>

Our goal is to create a
casual, family-friendly, neighborhood focused restaurant.  Currently, there is nothing like
it in the area, particularly on Aurora. 
There is a dense population in our neighborhood tucked between Phinney Ridge
and Greenlake, with no real sit-down food options.  In addition to pizza, we will also serve a variety of other items from our wood fired oven, along with an amazing weekend brunch and daily happy hour.  Mimosas and dutch babies anyone?   Here is a rough draft of our proposed menu without prices:
With the additional space we'll also have room for live music from some of the wildly talented musicians at the guitar store, an open mic night, and even trivia.  We'll carve out a nice cozy spot for kids to play while their parents relax and watch the Seahawks or Mariners on one of our TVs.   Don't worry, our current morning coffee service and famous breakfast burritos aren't going anywhere!  We are simply expanding on our business model.How the Funds Will Be UsedRemodeling the space next to us is a large undertaking, but we've done it once before and we know how to stretch pennies to the max.  You can rest assured that every cent donated will be put to good use.  Just like we did with our current space, we will be doing 95% of the construction ourselves to save on build out costs (thanks to incredibly helpful friends, family members, and customers!) Your donations will go directly towards...
Permitting costs

Construction materials

Commercial kitchen equipment
Plumbing costs to add two new bathrooms

Dining tables and chairs
I know it sounds like a lot to ask for $50,000 but realistically, building out a restaurant is incredibly expensive.  We also have investors who are helping to make this project a reality, but we felt strongly about wanting to get the community involved as well so that our loyal supporters can say they were a part of bringing this dream to life.   Unlike with Kickstarter, we will still get all of the funds raised even if we do not meet our goal.If we hit our goal, please don't stop there!  Any excess funds will be 
used towards a gelato maker and cold display case!  What's In It For You?
We have come up with some unique rewards to hook you up with in exchange for your contribution.  For all of you regulars who are already coming in multiple times a week, now is your chance to pay a little, and get a lot in return!  You can see all of them in detail on the right side of the screen.  It's important that you understand that every dollar counts!

<p><b>“The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward
justice.”</b></p>
<p>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
<p>I have always believed in the existence of liberty and
justice for all. Unfortunately, in today’s society, liberty and justice are
very expensive and sometimes unaffordable to the common man or woman. <b>I am one
of those common persons.</b> I desperately need your help in raising $5000 by
September 3, 2013 to pay the retainer fee for an attorney to serve as an expert
witness in a legal malpractice case I filed pro se in May 2013.  I was unable to afford the $20,000 retainer
fee required to engage an attorney to file the legal malpractice case on my
behalf prior to the statute of limitation expiring for my case. If I had not
filed my case pro se in May 2013, I would have been unable to file my case once
the statute of limitation had passed. </p>
<p>Each time I spoke with an attorney regarding legal
representation in this case, I felt devastated by the staggering fees presented
to me for legal representation. Prior to five years ago, I could have budgeted
carefully, and saved $20,000 over a two or three year period of time. However, five years ago, my life changed
drastically.  Circumstances beyond my
control resulted in a sudden loss of most of my income and left me suddenly
without sufficient finances and personally unable to afford an attorney for
very pressing legal matters.  My leading
witness for my case was dead and as I felt that person’s testimony was critical
to my defense and winning my case, I was convinced by the attorney afforded me
that it was in my best interest to enter into a plea deal.  </p>
<p>Dissatisfied with the plea agreement my attorney advised me
to agree to, I sought other legal advice regarding my case.  Approximately one and a half years later, I
discovered that the great majority of the information this attorney gave me, as
well as the legal advice given to me by another attorney he referred me to were
not only grossly misleading representations of the truth, but were outright
falsehoods.  I consulted several
attorneys who informed me that the whirlwind of legal wrongdoings both of these
attorneys have committed against me constitute legal malpractice. They further
informed me my cases were complex and would require $20,000 to $40,000 retainer
fees.  At that point, my hope of legal
representation and justice appeared remote, if not impossible.</p>
<p>I continued to pray and search for an attorney to represent
me. I was referred to an attorney and legal expert to represent me in both of
these cases.  Unfortunately, I am totally
unable to afford their retainer fees of $5000 each for each case ($20,000 total).  I need $10,000 by September 3, 2013 to retain
both attorneys, however, my main attorney says he will assist me legally if I
am able to secure an affidavit from my expert witness attorney ($5,000 retainer
fee required) and pay him $1000 of his $5000 retainer fee.</p>
<p>I am a <b>divorced mother of three children</b>, two of whom are in
college and the third is a senior in high school and will be entering college
August 2014.  By August 2014, all three
children will be in college at the same time. It is <b>very difficult to save any
money </b>under these conditions.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, I filed my claim against the
first attorney pro se to avoid the statute of limitations from expiring in that
case.  The second case’s statute of
limitation will expire November 29, 2013. 
Without your help, I will be unable to afford the retainer fees for my
attorneys and my case will be dismissed if the affidavit from my expert witness
is not received by September 3, 2013.  My
case’s dismissal would be <b>devastating financially and emotionally</b> as my family
and I have suffered many financial and personal losses due to the bad legal advice
and poor representation I received from both of these attorneys. </p>
<p>I <b>desperately</b> need an
attorney to represent me in these cases. 
<b>Please help.</b> Any and all contributions will be appreciated. I still
believe that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward
justice.” God bless you.</p>
