<h3>E2 Natural Wave Technology </h3>
<p>I'm David Sullivan, founder and inventor of E2 Performance Technologies, Inc. I invented ""<strong>E2</strong>"" which stands for ""<strong><i>Earth's Energy</i></strong>"" to help humans and their pets fight off ""<i><strong>electromagnetic radiation</strong></i>"" (EMRs) from cell phones, computers, electrical lines, etc that can disrupt your sleep, cause cancer and pre-mature aging and illnesses.</p>
<p>We are looking for first movers to invest in this technology and help us make our children aware via social media of how dangerous EMRs can be for their health, Specifically I am looking for the following;</p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Pre-sell our sleep bracelet with the E2 technology embedded at a drastic discount prior to retail launch to help you sleep better but more important help you fight the effects of EMRs not only during the night but by also wearing the bracelet during the day.</li>
<li>Help me spread the word via social media of how dangerous EMRs are for our children and and our pets on Facebook (E2 Performance).</li>
<li>Purchase the sleep bracelet for only $99.99 - that's half off the retail launch price and help me raise my goal of $100,000 or 1,000 bracelets which are now entering production.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Your pre-purchase of our sleep bracelet will not only help our company as a startup but will help us spread the word about EMRs and how they are destroying the health of our children. We have successfully launched a mattress protector with E2 Technology at retail which now sells for $300 for a king size protector. Your purchase will not only help you personally but will help us spread the word about EMRs and how <strong>E2</strong> can help defend off their effects on <i>balance, strength, flexibility and endurance.</i></p>
<p>Our biggest challenge right now is to scale the operation to develop more natural frequency generators so we can apply the technology to clothing because more E2 on a person is better. We have a <u><strong>patent pending for the frequency generator # US20110209723A1</strong></u> which is very strong and should be approved soon.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Mike Cook, I am 33 years old. I have been training in martial arts and fitness since I was 16 years old. I have gained experience in art, innovation and engineering since my early youth from working with my family who owns MRISAR Institute of Science, Art &amp; Robotics (mrisar.org). They are world renowned for having the largest selection of World-class Interactive Robotic Exhibits.</p>
<p>I injured my Rotator Cuff about seven years ago when I got into strength training. Needless to say I was extremely frustrated with the lack of effective ways to  rehabilitate and strengthen my Rotator Cuff. So I decided to design a machine to help me strengthen it. I didn't think it would end up being something that would benefit other people until I researched how common Rotator Cuff injuries were. I spent a lot of time developing the Cyclone to make it as safe, convenient and user friendly as possible.</p>
<p>The Cyclone addresses an important need for athletes, rehabilitation centers, professional and home gyms. The user will be able to conveniently strengthen the Rotator Cuff  resulting in greater shoulder strength, health and longevity. This will greatly reduce the risk of a tear in the Rotator Cuff that could potentially cost thousands in hospital/surgery fees, as well as any lost time from daily jobs and life. </p>
<p><strong>Facts:</strong> There are 4.5 Million Rotator Cuff injuries each year in the United states. Of which 250,000 require surgery with an additional 400,000 surgeries for related tendinitis or partial tears. With shoulder injuries being so common, it's obvious that there is a lack of convenient means to strengthen the Rotator Cuff. By making the Cyclone available to everyone I hope to provide an easy, convenient, non strenuous way to strengthen the Rotator Cuff, thus increasing the longevity of people's joints.</p>
<p><strong>Funding:</strong> A fully developed prototype will cost approximately  $15,000. That's not including  the cost of having CAD files produced ($100-$140 per hour) for CNC machining or having parts remade due to adjustments in the design (prototyping is EXPENSIVE. Obviously when it goes into production the price per unit will be far more economical). So to cover those estimated costs I need approximately $25,000 (to be safe).  When you subtract the cost of the perks and Indiegogos' cut, I would need to raise $50,000 to reach my desired $25,000 goal (if my math is right). Unless my goal is met without any perks being purchased (which is unlikely).</p>

<p>Angle adjustment of the main handle allow the user to strengthen the Rotator Cuff above the head for sport/job specific activities or below the waist if the user is trying to rehabilitate an injured shoulder that they can not lift very high.</p>

</div><div>
<p>The handle can be used clockwise or counter-clockwise to lift the weights by utilizing a custom ratchet mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>The Cyclone provides six isolated exercises: </strong></p>

<ul>

<p><strong>Benefits: </strong></p>
<p><strong>•    Physical Therapy;</strong> From damaged Rotator Cuffs to strained wrists and elbows, the Cyclone provides smooth precision action for any isolated movement. <br/><strong>•    Sports;</strong> Baseball, Football, Tennis etc. Strengthens and increases flexibility of the Rotator Cuff and Wrist, improving and prolonging the career of professional Athletes. <br/><strong>•    Work;</strong> If you have a job that requires continuous, strenuous overhead shoulder movement or use of your forearms such as; mechanics, carpentry, electrical, etc., then strengthening your shoulders and forearms will help prevent injury and prolong your career.<br/><strong>•    Martial Arts;</strong> Whether you are breaking grips, executing holds, joint locks or just looking to put a powerful rotation on your strikes, the cyclone will strengthen the rotational force of your arms and to give you the edge over your competition! <br/><strong>•    Body Building, Olympic Lifting, Power Lifting, Strong man, CrossFit;</strong> Any lifter knows that the Rotator Cuff and forearms are two of the most neglected parts of the body and that strengthening the Rotator Cuff can be tricky and dangerous.

Cancer Story is an interactive platform that allows those affected by cancer to reach out to one other and share their experiences. The purpose of this fundraising effort is to create the CS Diary: a tool which will help individual cancer patients  follow their progress by tracking treatments and their effects,  organizing and preparing for  appointments, reviewing trends and summarizing information to be shared with doctor or others. 
The Cancer Story team consists of cancer patients and professionals who believe that for people with cancer there are increasingly more reasons to be proactive about their care. Cancer treatments are complex, they multiply rapidly, and there are now more and more ways to address the same problem. Often, the best treatment choices can be made by closely monitoring treatment effects not just through diagnostic tests, but also by following trends of wellbeing parameters and day-to-day activities. The CS Diary plans to integrate such self-monitoring with the treatment planner, making it the go-to tool throughout the cancer journey. 

The CS Diary: Description
The CS Diary will be a smartphone application which will operate in three functional modes:

Daily Survey
Plan and Remind
Graphic Summary
Daily Survey will allow the user to submit updated information about his/her treatment developments, experiences, events, activities, new appointments, ideas, etc. It will be a self-activating system intended to survey the user at least daily (or as otherwise set) . Its menu will consist of three basic options :
Wellbeing and activity (How did you do today?)
Treatment/diagnostic data (Tell me about your treatment!)
Planner inquiry  (Do we need to make new plans?)
There will be further subdivisions which will unfold consecutively, allowing the user to navigate to the trackable parameter of interest. The Daily Survey will also allow the user to proceed directly to his/her preset trackable, parameter questionnaire that will allow a simple selection of the chosen trackables, as well as being easily adjustable and flexible in order to accommodate a wide variety of user interests and usage patterns as they may evolve. Users will be able to record their activities -  exercise, meals, sleep, etc. They will be also able to input in real time recordings of their symptoms, their intensity, as well as their estimates of energy, mood, ability to function, overall happiness or distress, etc. 
It will also provide a link to the Cancer Story main platform where the user will be able to directly communicate to the community of Cancer Story users about what's important to him/her, by posting a question, submitting a story, or reaching out directly to other users who have demonstrated potential knowledge on their topic of interest. 
Plan and Remind will be a calendar-based event planner where the user will be able to enter and review his/her upcoming appointments, set reminders and prepare for any other activities. It will also provide the option of including a description of the pending appointments. 
Visit Planner enables a user to prepare for what needs to be addressed during an upcoming appointment with the doctor or another provider. The Problem List function will allow review of ""on the go"" notes about issues that need to be addressed, and categorize questions based on whom they are to be asked to: the doctor (e.g., new symptoms, experimental treatments), the nurse (e.g., medication refills, lab results), the social worker (e.g.,copay assistance, transportation), etc. This planner can be used for many other functions, like preparing for support group meetings or educational activities. Users will be able to set their Medication Reminder which will signal the time when a medication is due, and will record it as ""administered"" on the Medication Tracker.

Cancer Story Purpose and Mission
Cancer Story is an online community of people who strongly believe that answers, and even solutions, to many of the problems posed by cancer can be found in the experiences of others.We believe the exchange of spontaneous and voluntary information, done in a safe and confidential medium, can provide an alternative route around the barriers -- like privacy and ownership concerns -- that have gridlocked the cancer establishment in this regard.
Our mission is to provide a platform where such a free exchange of cancer-related information can take place.Cancer Story: The Basic Premises
For those people with cancer there are increasingly more reasons to be proactive about their care.
As progress is made in conquering most cancers, for those affected:

Cancer is becoming more complex and difficult to understand
There is more than one way to address the same problem
When making a decision, there are more nuanced facts to be considered
Cancer management is becoming a more common-place activity in today’s world

Your doctor alone cannot always know what’s best for you.
While new discoveries on a molecular and genetic level allow us to understand and treat cancer better, there are limits to how helpful they may be:

Most studies on which doctors base their knowledge include only a small and highly selective fraction of all cancer patients
Many of those studies were likely conducted before much of the new information became available, so often today there are no straightforward, updated answers regarding the best treatment for a particular patient
The medical establishment is critical of unproven ideas and conservative in adopting new treatments. Until a sufficient amount of evidence has been accumulated, documented, reviewed and accepted, many patients don’t find out about potential treatment options on a timely basis

Even the best research may not address things that matter to you the most.
Research is focused on solid and objective facts, such as how long patients live or how long their cancer remains controlled, or what side effects they report. These facts, however, don’t say enough about a patient’s real-life experience. Our lives are a combination of multiple factors: physical, spiritual, social, economic, and others. The delicate interplay of these factors is largely lost in the world of objective facts and can only be accounted for using tools that are more closely connected to patients and caregivers.
Cancer can be a very lonely experience - until you discover that some of the issues you think only you experience are very similar to what others go through.
The support of family, friends and caregivers is invaluable, of course.  But even with their support, individuals with cancer often feel alone - alone in their experience.  Cancer Story intends to respond to this loneliness by offering a virtual community of people who are similarly lonely and seeking others who truly understand their experiences. The power of the Internet provides access to the community and support across the country and even the world with an unlimited number of like-minded and similarly experienced individuals in their cancer journey.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>My Drive</h3>
<p>As a kid I suffered from Asthma for over six years without having a clue of what caused my constant difficulty in breathing. Being from an African background where almost everything was linked to having a diabolical cause, no one bothered taking me to see a doctor, and this was influenced heavily by the financial status of my family; we just couldn't afford paying to see a doctor. My then suffering all would have been avoided or reduced if I had the luxury of seeking medical counsel.</p>
<h3><strong>Our First Trial</strong></h3>
<p>With my knowledge of the Tech world and having two sisters who are doctors, I decided to take up the challenge and I built a simple website that allowed users seek medical advice from my two doctor sisters via LiveChat, Audio and Video call.</p>
<p>This website was up for two months before my both doctor sisters had to leave the firm for a ""real job"", because the site was 100% user and Ad Free therefore, was generating zero $ in revenue. During this period, we had over three thousand users / visitors. This result was gotten with zero Advertising / Publicity.</p>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>It comes down to science. Fat cells freeze at higher temperatures than other surrounding tissues. The cryolysis technique safely delivers cooling to gently and effectively target the fat cells underneath the skin. </div><div>The treated fat cells are crystallized (frozen), and then die. Over time, your body naturally processes the fat and flushes these dead cells, leaving a more toned and sculpted you.</div><div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There is a distinct difference between cold adaptation which activates brown adipose tissue (BAT) and cryolysis. </span></div><div>
<p>When you increase cold exposure to your body you will activate brown cells as an energy source to stay warm and shrink white fat cells as their source of cellular fuel. But when you stop the cold exposure the brown fat cells are no longer active. And when you eat again the white fat cells will just ""plump"" right back to their original size.  </p>
<p>So now you have this yo-yo effect, just like with most diets. And unless you are willing to always feel cold, it is not going to give you the results you are looking for. </p>
<p>Science shows how we will continue to burn calories for a period after cold exposure due to the body's attempt to regulate the core temperature. But it does not continue burning white fat cells days later when you have been keeping yourself toasty and warm. </p>
<p>This is just common sense. After all, we don't stay nice and thin weeks after a skiing trip. One has to be in the cold continually in order for brown fat to stay activated.</p>
<p>Cryolysis works completely different than any other fat removal system. Y<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">our white fat cells are completely destroyed and removed from your body over a few weeks time. GONE permanently, not shrunken down waiting to plump up again when the cold exposure is gone. </span></p>
<p>With cryolysis the cells are removed naturally and as long as you do not exceed the calories needed to maintain your body weight, then you will not create more white fat cells. </p>
<p>Independent of ongoing cold exposure, the fat is gone because you froze it off naturally without invasive surgery or high out of pocket expense.</p>
<p>This is why we are so excited to bring the first complete DIY cryolysis system to crowdfunding. People now have the opportunity to literally save thousands of dollars on removing unwanted fat, and can do it in the comfort of their own homes.   </p>

<p>There <u>are</u> multiple benefits to cold conditioning including boosting your immune system, improving circulation, decreasing pain, increasing testosterone and sperm levels and aiding with depression and weight loss. </p>
<div>It's usually recommended to take a cold shower, go for a winter walk, or lay in the snow to become cold adapted. The CryoSculptor system is far more tolerable and can be done indoors all year round. </div>
<div>
<p>One CryoSculptor user commented that ""it begins to feel like you have a buffer around your body as if you are covered with a double paned layer of glass."" </p>
<p>Becoming more cold adapted also leads to a more active lifestyle during the cold winter months. Athletes can use the belts during training to lean up, burn calories and become cold adapted for sports that are performed in cooler temperatures.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">In an interview with NBC Sports, Phelps was quoted as saying that he ate approximately 12,000 calories per day during the 2008 Summer Olympics. ""This included a breakfast of three fried egg sandwiches, a five-egg omelet, three pieces of french toast, three pancakes and grits. Lunch was typically a pound of pasta and two sandwiches. For dinner, he would eat an entire large pizza and a pound of pasta"".</span></p>
<p><i><b>The reason he could eat so much and stay so lean? </b></i> Besides the obvious, burning calories while swimming, he was in water that was below his core body temperature of 98.6 degrees. We naturally burn more calories trying to keep our bodies warm and the cold temperatures cause our bodies to create more brown fat cells.</p>

<div>Unlike white fat cells which store calories, brown fat burns energy and produces heat. </div>
<div>Unfortunately, most of us do not have much brown fat. Babies actually have more brown fat than adults, which is why they are able to stay warm without much natural insulation. </div>
<div>Most of our brown fat is lost by the time we reach adulthood and women tend to have more brown fat then men. People with lower BMI's (Body Mass Indexes) also tend to have more brown fat. </div>
<div>Brown fat is activated by cold and scientists are now finding that our bodies can produce more brown fat cells the more we are subjected to colder temperatures.</div>
<div>Please understand this could take a long time and REQUIRES you to be cold for months in order to possibly create any brown adipose tissue, not hours, days or weeks as they might have you believe and even then there is no guarantee you will ever be able to create brown fat cells.  </div>
<div>We want happy customers and will not tell you something unless we know it to be completely true.  We believe in complete honesty and transparency to ensure the long term growth of any business.</div>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">First I would like to congratulate all of the previous cold application crowd funding campaigns that have come before us.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A little about how the CryoSculptor came about....</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I started working on this project back in 2012, and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I thought that maybe I had missed my opportunity to successfully launch this product. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I knew that I had a great product, but had to put things on hold for over a year while our family dealt with a personal loss. I watched as other campaigns marketed the brown fat and cold adapt benefits. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My belts covered those benefits and more. I also began working on prototyping a vest attachment (criss-cross pattern) shoulder belt that would connect to our CrySculptor waist belt to provide more cold exposure. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Eventually this will provide the best system possible, but we will still retain the smaller CryoSculptor belts for the arms, ankles, thighs, chin and such.</span></p>
<p>When I looked at how I had personally been using the belts and what my lifestyle was like, I realized that people might be a little let down with their results. </p>
<p>T<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">he reason is this, activating what ever brown fat cells we may have would burn calories, But you have to be COLD, to the point of shivering in order to get MAXIMUM results. Many people, including myself, will NOT continue this ongoing and will likely be </span>disappointed with just BAT activation alone.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The reality is that we will continue to develop more white fat cells as long as we eat unhealthy and not exercise. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Just like liposuction, the fat is gone, but we can easily produce more. This is why it is so important to not only become cold adapted, but to continue to use the belts as needed. This is what I have done for over a year and I'm still toned. I don't have to be cold all the time </span>and<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> neither will you.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Again, cryolysis </span>causes<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> cell death. Cold adaptation and brown fat activation do NOT!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">What if you could first rid yourself of the fat deposits around your waist, back, arms, ankles and chin?...</span></p>
<p>Then if and when you decide to continue with cold adaptation training and Brown Adipose Tissue activation, you now have even less white fat to burn so you will stay leaner with even less effort.</p>
<h2>Remember, there is a BIG difference between burning fat cells and destroying them permanently.</h2>
<p>When I finally got rid of that belly fat I noticed that I then started to lose all of the fat along my ribs and obliques. My back was getting more toned as well.</p>
<p>I also started to wear more ice packs around my lower back and sides or what some people refer to as ""muffin top"".</p>
<p>I wanted to destroy the fat cells not just burn them.</p>
<h2>What's the difference?</h2>
<p>When you burn fat cells you just shrink them down, you don't remove them in any way. They just get smaller until you fill them back up and unless you change your diet and/or exercise, you will gain some of the fat back.</p>
<h2>If you destroy the cell, then it is gone permanently!</h2>
<p>""Honey I Shrunk The Fat Cell"" down, but don't feed it after midnight because it will turn back into a fat gremlin cell!</p>
<p>Seriously, I hope this makes sense to you. Since I started using the belts I genuinely eat what I want (usually up until right before I go to bed). I have friends and family who can all attest to my eating habits as well as their astonishment as to how I remain in great shape.</p>
<p>I have not exercised much over the last few years because of a shoulder injury and just dealing with the ups and downs of every day life. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I continue to eat whatever I want and manage to stay lean as ever. I seldom wear the belt anymore and yet I stay lean.</span></p>
<p><strong>It's highly possible that when I create a new fat cell because of my diet or overeating, my body consumes it, burns it, then shrivels it down like a raisin. </strong></p>
<p>Every so often I will wear the belt again and destroy those shriveled up fat cells permanently!</p>
<p>Once you start to see results and how easily you attained them, you will become more motivated to eat better and lead a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p>I have become highly cold adapted from the CryoSculptor belts and am usually seen without a shirt well into the fall/winter months here in Washington. I enjoy feeling the sun on my skin when ever it's out!</p>
<h3>Become what you envision and you will develop the habits to maintain that reality!</h3>

CryoSculptor is more than just a Cold Adaption or Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) activation tool, which just shrinks fat cells
Ours is a DIY cryolysis system similar to ""Cool Sculpting"" which destroys stubborn fat cells permanently
CrySculptor sculpts your Waist, Back, Thighs, Ankles, Arms, Chin or anywhere else you apply the bands
Our complete system is a fraction of the cost of just one ""Cool Sculpting"" session (multiple sessions are typically needed for successful results)
We use a special Cryo Gel in our ice packs to get maximum results and longer cold transference times
Heavy duty velcro loop material is used on the pouches for maximum adjustment and to eliminate shifting
Our bands are made of a thick 3mm premium neoprene U-Loop material (which has excellent insulate properties) and finished sides and edges 
We offer the FIRST and ONLY Chin sculptor for home use
CryoSculptor is the absolute best Value for the money
A cooling vest add-on option for your waist belt (which will give you the option to do cold adapt training at any time) is already in the works
All of our belts can be used for sports injuries and/or aching muscles with maximum insulation
CryoSculptor is being offered at a lower price and will work more effectively than piecing your own DIY belt together
Our belts are made 100% locally in the Seattle Washington area so your contribution will help support American businesses
Our Complete Deluxe System is Only $189 for the first 25 contributors
Waist belt alone is only $49 for the first 25 contributors. 





             
It comes down to science. Fat cells freeze at higher temperatures than other surrounding tissues. The cryolysis technique safely delivers cooling to gently and effectively target the fat cells underneath the skin. The treated fat cells are crystallized (frozen), and then die. Over time, your body naturally processes the fat and flushes these dead cells, leaving a more toned and sculpted you.There is a distinct difference between cold adaptation which activates brown adipose tissue (BAT) and cryolysis. 
When you increase cold exposure to your body you will activate brown cells as an energy source to stay warm and shrink white fat cells as their source of cellular fuel. But when you stop the cold exposure the brown fat cells are no longer active. And when you eat again the white fat cells will just ""plump"" right back to their original size.  
So now you have this yo-yo effect, just like with most diets. And unless you are willing to always feel cold, it is not going to give you the results you are looking for. 
Science shows how we will continue to burn calories for a period after cold exposure due to the body's attempt to regulate the core temperature. But it does not continue burning white fat cells days later when you have been keeping yourself toasty and warm. 
This is just common sense. After all, we don't stay nice and thin weeks after a skiing trip. One has to be in the cold continually in order for brown fat to stay activated.
Cryolysis works completely different than any other fat removal system. Your white fat cells are completely destroyed and removed from your body over a few weeks time. GONE permanently, not shrunken down waiting to plump up again when the cold exposure is gone. 
With cryolysis the cells are removed naturally and as long as you do not exceed the calories needed to maintain your body weight, then you will not create more white fat cells. 
Independent of ongoing cold exposure, the fat is gone because you froze it off naturally without invasive surgery or high out of pocket expense.
This is why we are so excited to bring the first complete DIY cryolysis system to crowdfunding. People now have the opportunity to literally save thousands of dollars on removing unwanted fat, and can do it in the comfort of their own homes.   

        

There are multiple benefits to cold conditioning including boosting your immune system, improving circulation, decreasing pain, increasing testosterone and sperm levels and aiding with depression and weight loss. 
It's usually recommended to take a cold shower, go for a winter walk, or lay in the snow to become cold adapted. The CryoSculptor system is far more tolerable and can be done indoors all year round. 

One CryoSculptor user commented that ""it begins to feel like you have a buffer around your body as if you are covered with a double paned layer of glass."" 
Becoming more cold adapted also leads to a more active lifestyle during the cold winter months. Athletes can use the belts during training to lean up, burn calories and become cold adapted for sports that are performed in cooler temperatures.






       

In an interview with NBC Sports, Phelps was quoted as saying that he ate approximately 12,000 calories per day during the 2008 Summer Olympics. ""This included a breakfast of three fried egg sandwiches, a five-egg omelet, three pieces of french toast, three pancakes and grits. Lunch was typically a pound of pasta and two sandwiches. For dinner, he would eat an entire large pizza and a pound of pasta"".
The reason he could eat so much and stay so lean?  Besides the obvious, burning calories while swimming, he was in water that was below his core body temperature of 98.6 degrees. We naturally burn more calories trying to keep our bodies warm and the cold temperatures cause our bodies to create more brown fat cells.


Unlike white fat cells which store calories, brown fat burns energy and produces heat. 
Unfortunately, most of us do not have much brown fat. Babies actually have more brown fat than adults, which is why they are able to stay warm without much natural insulation. 
Most of our brown fat is lost by the time we reach adulthood and women tend to have more brown fat then men. People with lower BMI's (Body Mass Indexes) also tend to have more brown fat. 
Brown fat is activated by cold and scientists are now finding that our bodies can produce more brown fat cells the more we are subjected to colder temperatures.
Please understand this could take a long time and REQUIRES you to be cold for months in order to possibly create any brown adipose tissue, not hours, days or weeks as they might have you believe and even then there is no guarantee you will ever be able to create brown fat cells.  
We want happy customers and will not tell you something unless we know it to be completely true.  We believe in complete honesty and transparency to ensure the long term growth of any business.
They are even trying to formulate a drug that will convert white fat cells into what they are calling beige fat cells. But then what? You have to stay cold to get any benefits.  Remove the cold and you get no results. 


Cold adaptation has a lot of benefits, but it will NOT eliminate white fat cells permanently the way cryolysis does:










        
It is a proven fact that children have developed dimples from eating popsicles. The term is called popsicle panniculitis, which is ""inflammation of the subcutaneous fat after prolonged exposure to cold"". 
It was this discovery that led to the idea of cryolysis. If children can permanently freeze away the fat in their cheeks, then it stood to reason that by applying cold to fat in other areas of the body we could also eliminate the fat in those areas. And we have created a system to do just that, freeze away the fat permanently!

Until now, the most commonly used treatment for permanent fat reduction has been liposuction, an invasive procedure that costs thousands of dollars and has significant risks and side effects. Another increasingly popular option is called ""Cool Sculpting"", which is essentially an in-office cryolysis treatment. This procedure has fewer risks, but equally or more expensive than liposuction. Here are some typical examples:  
AND HERE IS WHAT WE HAVE TO OFFER YOU!:The cost above indicates retail pricing. We are offering smaller packages in our perks section. Find out how you can support this campaign and get a significant discount off of retail pricing.            Aside from eliminating unwanted fat, the CryoSculptor belts have other great benefits. You can use them for sports injuries, to keep you cool in the hot summer months, or reduce swelling from diabetes or other medical conditions. 
Because of the flexible design of our cool packs, the cold is distributed evenly around the applied area. We have designed the belts to fit targeted areas where most of us store unwanted fat, but they can be used anywhere on the body (i.e. criss-crossed around the chest, the back of the neck, arms, knees, elbows, etc).








EARLY PROTOTYPE DESIGNS:




   FINAL PROTOTYPES:







  


                           
     




















First I would like to congratulate all of the previous cold application crowd funding campaigns that have come before us.
A little about how the CryoSculptor came about....


I started working on this project back in 2012, and I thought that maybe I had missed my opportunity to successfully launch this product. 


I knew that I had a great product, but had to put things on hold for over a year while our family dealt with a personal loss. I watched as other campaigns marketed the brown fat and cold adapt benefits. 
My belts covered those benefits and more. I also began working on prototyping a vest attachment (criss-cross pattern) shoulder belt that would connect to our CrySculptor waist belt to provide more cold exposure. 
Eventually this will provide the best system possible, but we will still retain the smaller CryoSculptor belts for the arms, ankles, thighs, chin and such.
When I looked at how I had personally been using the belts and what my lifestyle was like, I realized that people might be a little let down with their results. 
The reason is this, activating what ever brown fat cells we may have would burn calories, But you have to be COLD, to the point of shivering in order to get MAXIMUM results. Many people, including myself, will NOT continue this ongoing and will likely be disappointed with just BAT activation alone.
The reality is that we will continue to develop more white fat cells as long as we eat unhealthy and not exercise. 
Just like liposuction, the fat is gone, but we can easily produce more. This is why it is so important to not only become cold adapted, but to continue to use the belts as needed. This is what I have done for over a year and I'm still toned. I don't have to be cold all the time and neither will you.
Again, cryolysis causes cell death. Cold adaptation and brown fat activation do NOT!
What if you could first rid yourself of the fat deposits around your waist, back, arms, ankles and chin?...
Then if and when you decide to continue with cold adaptation training and Brown Adipose Tissue activation, you now have even less white fat to burn so you will stay leaner with even less effort.
Remember, there is a BIG difference between burning fat cells and destroying them permanently.
When I finally got rid of that belly fat I noticed that I then started to lose all of the fat along my ribs and obliques. My back was getting more toned as well.
I also started to wear more ice packs around my lower back and sides or what some people refer to as ""muffin top"".
I wanted to destroy the fat cells not just burn them.
What's the difference?
When you burn fat cells you just shrink them down, you don't remove them in any way. They just get smaller until you fill them back up and unless you change your diet and/or exercise, you will gain some of the fat back.
If you destroy the cell, then it is gone permanently!
""Honey I Shrunk The Fat Cell"" down, but don't feed it after midnight because it will turn back into a fat gremlin cell!
Seriously, I hope this makes sense to you. Since I started using the belts I genuinely eat what I want (usually up until right before I go to bed). I have friends and family who can all attest to my eating habits as well as their astonishment as to how I remain in great shape.
I have not exercised much over the last few years because of a shoulder injury and just dealing with the ups and downs of every day life. I continue to eat whatever I want and manage to stay lean as ever. I seldom wear the belt anymore and yet I stay lean.
It's highly possible that when I create a new fat cell because of my diet or overeating, my body consumes it, burns it, then shrivels it down like a raisin. 
Every so often I will wear the belt again and destroy those shriveled up fat cells permanently!
Once you start to see results and how easily you attained them, you will become more motivated to eat better and lead a healthier lifestyle.
I have become highly cold adapted from the CryoSculptor belts and am usually seen without a shirt well into the fall/winter months here in Washington. I enjoy feeling the sun on my skin when ever it's out!
Become what you envision and you will develop the habits to maintain that reality!

                          (Paul Galaviz, age 52, Founder of the CryoSculptor, November, 2015)

It was never this easy for me to lose that belly fat and see the muscle definition that was hidden underneath. My partner, Cristina, is also seeing similar great results:

              

       (Cristina Leveque, age 47, CryoSculptor Artistic Director, November, 2015)



The CryoSculptor belts also function as high-quality cold compresses. Unlike plastic bags, they do not leak. They will also stay in place and can be applied directly to the skin since the pouches add a protective layer.
You will find that the best part about using the CryoSculptor belts is knowing that you're removing any unwanted fat that you may have put on over the years with little to no effort.  
Sure, I eat unhealthy sometimes, but I'm in great shape for a 52 year old! After all of the years of crazy diets and workout routines, I was never able to lose that stubborn fat. Now it's gone, simply by applying gel ice packs to my waist. It's that easy!  Plus I saved thousands of dollars in the process.

<p>The internal pipe mechanism was first patented in 2013, with further patents awarded through the International Patent Treaty process. In recent years, a number of design iterations have been created and tested using 3D rapid prototyping, to make an efficient and portable pipe; with assistance from a product designer and former aviation engineer. </p>

<p>Calm Pipe is serious about ensuring its products and their life cycles have limited impact on the environment. We plan to offset some of the energy and resources we use as a business. Assuming our campaign reaches the pledge target, we will adopt the initiatives stated in the environmental commitments section, as our starting point towards being part of a circular rather than linear economy.   </p>
<p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p>
<p>We have used high-quality components and materials in order to achieve accuracy and efficiency for the device, and to provide a longer product life span. This raises the overall cost of our pipes when compared to cheaper options, but aligns with our philosophy of delivering a high quality product that will last. The injection moulded parts in our pipes will be food safe and BPA free and enable extended durability. If 3D printing of the more technical parts is required, we will use only ""tough standard"" resins which are both durable and low emitting.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p>
<p>For now, we will stay as much as possible with recyclable food grade plastic, but going forward we intend to focus our R&amp;D around bio-based plastics, so that long-term our products will breakdown a lot faster when exposed to natural composting processes. In the meantime, our customers will be supplied with a long-lasting pipe with instructions on recycling.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable materials</strong></p>
<p>We have explored the options currently available for bio-based plastic; however, the plastics industry is currently stuck between existing recyclable plastic and emerging bio-based (corn starch etc) plastics which most often will only breakdown in a less accessible ""commercial composter"" and actually contaminate regular recyclable plastic. Please let us know if you have any other ideas on sustainable plastic options.</p>
<p>Our Manuka wood chips are sustainably harvested and kiln treated (without chemicals), making them suitable to add to your household compost.  Our filter pads are also made from a non-bleached compostable material. </p>
<p><strong>Environmentally friendly factories</strong></p>
<p>We want to run an environmentally conscious and ethical business and for this reason we have focused our manufacturing in New Zealand. We will use high quality suppliers for our injection moulding, CNC engineering and many other supply services, even though the related costs may be higher than larger producing nations. We shall still purchase some specialty parts offshore, but want to develop a productive business, that looks after its work team and gives back to the environment and the community. </p>
<p><strong>Sustainable fulfillment and distribution</strong></p>
<p>We are making sure our packaging is minimal, using recyclable and natural materials where possible and plan to use packaging bags made from compostable corn starch.</p>
<p>Our decision to use New Zealand podocarp hardwood for the bowl of our Pappy pipe, is not just for the fantastic quality of this timber, but because we want to create an inter-generational value for these magnificent trees and know exactly where the wood is coming from. In New Zealand, many podocarp forests were clear-felled both pre and post-European colonisation, extending right up until the 1980s, for lower value purposes; unfortunately the same pattern still continues across the world.</p>
<p>For Calm Pipe, if sustainably harvested supplies of the hardwoods are not available, our approach will be to source selected sections from self-fallen trees in appropriate areas, given we can make many pipes from a relatively small amount of timber. This approach is better for the environment, our economy and for future generations, creating the long term incentive to plant more trees.</p>

<p>      Please receive our distinguished wishes for health, prosperity and success in everything you do!</p>
<p>     Your courtesy and gratitude ask you to solve together a vital issue for everything that a woman (daughter, wife, grandmother, sister, aunt, and any other woman) can contact accidentally or through a bad intent -voice, a virus whose destruction in the woman's body is often the end of the woman's death, is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).</p>
<p>       In order to understand the reality and usefulness of our approach, we will focus on some of the official information that shows the dramatic situation of HPV infection among women around the world.</p>
<p><br/><br/>About HUMAN PAPILOMA VIRUS (HPV)<br/><br/>       Official Satatistics shows , every two minutes, a woman dies of cervical cancer and in each year shall be discovered a half million new cases in the world. In Romania, the cervical cancer is the third cause of death by cancer in women, after lung cancer and the breast cancer<br/>     Cervical cancer, caused for the most part of the human Papilloma virus (HPV), is located in the EU in second place, after breast cancer, in statistical neoplasms ,affecting women with 18-45 years old .  In the EU is recorded approximately 33,000 new cases in each year, the number of deaths due to this type of cancer rising to 15,000.<br/>    The statistical informations shows that this type of cancer affect 3 times more women than ovarian cancer. Infection with HPV appears frequently to young women, sexually active, the incidence of cervical cancer be greater but to persons over 35 years, raising the problem of slow progress of viral infection by cancer. According to statistical data, over 66% of the new cases of cancer found in 2005 appear to women between the ages of 35 and 55 years  and approximately 70 percent of the deaths caused by cervical cancer is recorded at women between the ages of 45 and 70 years.</p>
<p>     The Science comes in support of this problem with an anti-HPV vaccine, which is addressed to both women and men aged between 12-25 years old, and which assumes the role to provide prevention in the cervical cancer problem. Appropriate use of this type of prevention might bring in the next few years a significant decline in the incidence of this type of cancer. In the USA, this vaccine has been introduced in the scheme of compulsory vaccination at the age group between 9-12 years.<br/>     The immense drama is that, in the raw material treatment of women, who already have already been infected with the virus HPV , with the stem carcinogenic, the current medicine still doesn't have reasonable solutions. In most cases, the treatment shall be reduced to the surgical intervention of the total histerectomie, which means a a real  psychic and physical trauma, for the woman in question, to her family and for the society.</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies, the clinical and laboratory examinations, have demonstrated while the existence of a causal association between human direct papilomavirusurile (HPV) and cervical cancer in the 99,7% of the cases. In fact, the infection with HPV oncogen required"" is ""cause of cervical cancer. The progression of the cervical cancer is slow, this type of cancer being preceded by the lesions which can be identified from the time the routine of gynecology.<br/>There are 15 types of HPV which may cause the appearance of a cervical cancer, the most common being types 16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52, 58, 35, 59, etc. worldwide, 70% of the cases of cervical cancer are based on the infection with the types of HPV 16 and 18.</p>
<p>Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by Human Papiloma Virus infection, and medical statistics show that almost all the adults active from the point of view of sexual contact at least one type of  HPV throughout their lives.<br/>There are more than 150 strains of the virus found, but most do not life threatening. The strains 16 and 18 are responsible, but, with up to 70% of the cases diagnosed cervical cancer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Who we are and what we want</p>
<p><br/>      We are a group of people with various specializations : medicine, social services , technical engineering , legal assistance  which we have international legal and registered a total technology , absolutely non-invasive, which can respond by use, to carry out the complete treatment therapy and implicitly of the virus HPV, so we eliminate  source total cervical cancer.<br/>To achieve this, we want to perform clinical studies, on groups of women as large, infected with strains of  HPV 16 and 18, respecting all international standards in the field of clinical studies and demostrare the effectiveness of therapies and treatments, with technology that we have.

     Your courtesy and gratitude ask you to solve together a vital issue for everything that a woman (daughter, wife, grandmother, sister, aunt, and any other woman) can contact accidentally or through a bad intent -voice, a virus whose destruction in the woman's body is often the end of the woman's death, is Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).
       In order to understand the reality and usefulness of our approach, we will focus on some of the official information that shows the dramatic situation of HPV infection among women around the world.
About HUMAN PAPILOMA VIRUS (HPV)       Official Satatistics shows , every two minutes, a woman dies of cervical cancer and in each year shall be discovered a half million new cases in the world. In Romania, the cervical cancer is the third cause of death by cancer in women, after lung cancer and the breast cancer     Cervical cancer, caused for the most part of the human Papilloma virus (HPV), is located in the EU in second place, after breast cancer, in statistical neoplasms ,affecting women with 18-45 years old .  In the EU is recorded approximately 33,000 new cases in each year, the number of deaths due to this type of cancer rising to 15,000.    The statistical informations shows that this type of cancer affect 3 times more women than ovarian cancer. Infection with HPV appears frequently to young women, sexually active, the incidence of cervical cancer be greater but to persons over 35 years, raising the problem of slow progress of viral infection by cancer. According to statistical data, over 66% of the new cases of cancer found in 2005 appear to women between the ages of 35 and 55 years  and approximately 70 percent of the deaths caused by cervical cancer is recorded at women between the ages of 45 and 70 years.
     The Science comes in support of this problem with an anti-HPV vaccine, which is addressed to both women and men aged between 12-25 years old, and which assumes the role to provide prevention in the cervical cancer problem. Appropriate use of this type of prevention might bring in the next few years a significant decline in the incidence of this type of cancer. In the USA, this vaccine has been introduced in the scheme of compulsory vaccination at the age group between 9-12 years.     The immense drama is that, in the raw material treatment of women, who already have already been infected with the virus HPV , with the stem carcinogenic, the current medicine still doesn't have reasonable solutions. In most cases, the treatment shall be reduced to the surgical intervention of the total histerectomie, which means a a real  psychic and physical trauma, for the woman in question, to her family and for the society.
Epidemiological studies, the clinical and laboratory examinations, have demonstrated while the existence of a causal association between human direct papilomavirusurile (HPV) and cervical cancer in the 99,7% of the cases. In fact, the infection with HPV oncogen required"" is ""cause of cervical cancer. The progression of the cervical cancer is slow, this type of cancer being preceded by the lesions which can be identified from the time the routine of gynecology.There are 15 types of HPV which may cause the appearance of a cervical cancer, the most common being types 16, 18, 45, 31, 33, 52, 58, 35, 59, etc. worldwide, 70% of the cases of cervical cancer are based on the infection with the types of HPV 16 and 18.
Most cases of cervical cancer are caused by Human Papiloma Virus infection, and medical statistics show that almost all the adults active from the point of view of sexual contact at least one type of  HPV throughout their lives.There are more than 150 strains of the virus found, but most do not life threatening. The strains 16 and 18 are responsible, but, with up to 70% of the cases diagnosed cervical cancer.
 
Who we are and what we want
      We are a group of people with various specializations : medicine, social services , technical engineering , legal assistance  which we have international legal and registered a total technology , absolutely non-invasive, which can respond by use, to carry out the complete treatment therapy and implicitly of the virus HPV, so we eliminate  source total cervical cancer.To achieve this, we want to perform clinical studies, on groups of women as large, infected with strains of  HPV 16 and 18, respecting all international standards in the field of clinical studies and demostrare the effectiveness of therapies and treatments, with technology that we have. Through these studies, at the end , will be able to demonstrate effective clinical technology on which the raw material we have, in the total destruction of the virus, hpv strains 16 and 18, the generating most cervical cancer, toggled by placing at the disposal of all the persons concerned, mode of treatment and the default solution for the treatment with maximum efficiency, with this type of virus.The result of this study will be one designed to resolve this problem of total major level, the life of the women of today, giving them the chance to a new normal life, with family and loved ones, rescuing them from death.
 
How can you help us
We achieved technology and we have gone through all the stages of the international registration.The costs of the clinical trial, for this type of virus strains HPV with 16 and 18 generators most cervical cancer, exceed 400,000 euros, the amount of which we need imperative to achieve this objective extremely important for the life of the woman.
At this time, we need your financial support that allows us to achieve this clinical study and conduit for joy and peace in the souls of women who have been traumatizate of infestation with this virus, and their famiilor by default.Your support will be known all over the world,  together with the publication of the outcome of the clinical  study

I got  diagnosed with diabetes (mellitus) type 1 in 1994 at the age of 14.  Since then I experienced many improvements through the innovation of new  medicaments and new technical tools supporting the diabetes therapy. The  latest steps for me were ground-breaking: in January 2018 I switched to  an pump and a CGM sensor which is monitoring my blood sugar  level every 5 minutes. In February 2018 I set up a closed loop  regulating system (""the loop"") using my android mobile phone. This had a  huge impact as now my blood sugar levels were now very close to a non  diabetic's levels without any severe hypoglycaemia (too few sugar in the  blood) and with a reduced level of non-severe hypoglycaemias. Also this  came with much more comfort and safety. I may even read my blood  sugar levels on my arm watch.</p><p>Even though the loop brings you quite  well and safe through the night, sometimes you wake up and wonder what  your blood sugar levels might be. This was a small gap of comfort  during the night because I would not wear my arm watch and I had too  look for my phone on the night desk and then try to read the sugar level  with sleepy eyes. I decided I want to close the gap and create a device  that is showing the time, blood sugar level and development direction  on the display in huge, easy readable letters.</p><p>If you have diabetes and have no idea what I was talking about above, I suggest you find out more regarding these topics:</p><p>- pumps (is this right for me?)</p><p>- any continuous blood glucose measurement systems like CGM systems or FGM systems (with some tweaks)</p><p>- the Nightscout project - bringing your data to the cloud allowing cross device access and web based reporting</p><p>The  blood glucose clock introduced with this project is dependent on the  usage of the Nightscout project for storing your continuous blood glucose  levels coming from a CMG or FGM system. It is obtaining these values  through the usage of a mandatory WiFi internet connection (a stationary  WiFi router is recommended). </p><h3><strong>Disclaimers:</strong></h3><p> Please  do not make any therapeutical decisions based on the device's display.  If you do so you do it on your own risk. This is not a medical device  and not compliant with any medical standards or regulations.</p><h3><strong>Technical disclaimer: </strong></h3><p>You need to use Nightscout with this project. You need a WiFi  internet connection and a mobile phone with Android (iOS (Apple) through  4.000€ stretch goal)  to configure the device. You need any setup that  uploads your CGM/FCM blood glucose levels to Nightscout.</p><h3><strong>What you will get:</strong></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545355367/kwifjqtokejzpl74oh66.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We designed the clock without any buttons. So the configuration will  be done through an android (iOS (Apple) through 4.000€ stretch goal)  ""control app"" that is supplied free of charge. Due to Apple's  arbitrariness regarding the acceptance of apps created on their  platforms, we cannot guarantee the release of the iOS (Apple) version  even though it is quite probable.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545355397/hbbnoxfmyzjb7d5aosmy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Product Features:</h3><p>- Android Bluetooth control app (Apple stretch goal)</p><p>- 12h/24h clock configurable</p><p>- time zone configurable</p><p>- time is taken from an internet source</p><p>- colour changeable through app</p><p>- brightness configurable through app</p><p>- automatic brightness levelling is optional and configurable through the app</p><p>The blood sugar clock will be updatable via internet. This will also apply to the prototypes.</p><p>We will deliver the clocks in the order of the indigogo backing  number (prototype pledge levels have an earlier delivery date). The assembly is a manual process.</p><p>The shipping will be charged separately through the pledge manager process.</p><p>We will offer free colour options (at least one) and optionally addon  colouring during the pledge manager process. We have not decided, yet  what the options will be. We have also not decided, yet, on the casing's  material. This will also be dependent on the number of devices we sell.  Under 100 devices we prefer to use our 3D printer to produce the  casings. We will consider buying a second one with 50 devices sold. With  100 devices sold we will consider outsourcing the case production to a  moulding lab. This would impact the project's timetable negatively but  improve the casings quality drastically.</p><p>Note: Most likely the casing will be 3D printer produced and will not  have the feel and quality you are accustomed to with industrial  manufactured plastics. If we choose the use PLA as the 3D printer  plastic the casing should not be subjected to temperatures above 70°C  and not to direct sunlight. Therefore PLA would be a bad material to  have in your car. We are still working on optimizing the production and  pre-production process.</p><p>The device is powered by a 5V micro USB port. The power plug and  cables are not supplied with the device. We might add these as a small  add-on through the pledge manager. A usual USB (1 A is sufficient) power  plug and micro USB cable (most phones use these!) are already found in  most households.</p><h3>State of the project </h3><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/n5lx1N7ijgo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3> </h3><p>We have finalized the hardware that we want to employ. This  includes a microprocessor board with Bluetooth and WiFi and low energy  consumption. We chose a 2.8"" colour TFT display for a modern display and a  photo sensitive LED (photo sensor) to allow a sourrounding matching  brightness configuration. We are currently storing the configuration in  the code and are able to read &amp; display blood glucose levels and  development directions from an SSL encrypted nightscout page. We have  almost finished the casing design. Mainly we need optimize the fitting  of the microprocessor board and the access to the USB power plug. We  also need to figure out which screws may be suitable.

Ich wurde 1994 im Alter von 14 Jahren mit Diabetes (Mellitus) Typ 1 diagnostiziert. Seitdem habe ich viele Verbesserungen durch die Innovation von neuen Medikamenten und neuen technischen Hilfsmitteln zur Unterstützung der Diabetestherapie miterlebt. Die neuesten Fortschritte waren für mich bahnbrechend: Im Januar 2018 wechselte ich zu einer Pumpe und einem CGM-Sensor, der alle 5 Minuten meinen Blutzuckerspiegel überprüft. Im Februar 2018 habe ich mit meinem Android-Handy ein Regelungssystem (""The Loop"") eingerichtet. Das hatte enorme Folgen, da jetzt mein Blutzuckerspiegel sehr nahe an den Werten eines Nicht-Diabetikers ohne schwere Hypoglykämien (zu wenig Zucker im Blut) und mit einem geringeren Anteil an nicht schweren Hypoglykämien lag. Dadurch ist mein Alltag sehr viel komfortabler und vor allem sicherer geworden. Jetzt kann ich meinen Blutzuckerspiegel sogar auf meiner Armbanduhr ablesen.</p><p>Obwohl der Loop einen recht gut und sicher durch die Nacht bringt, wacht man manchmal auf und fragt sich, wie sein Blutzuckerspiegel aussehen könnte. Da ich meine Armbanduhr über Nacht nicht trage, war das eine unschöne Komfortlücke in der Nacht. Ich musste also mein Handy auf dem Nachttisch suchen und dann versuchen, den Zuckerspiegel mit verschlafenen Augen abzulesen. Ich beschloss, diese Lücke zu schließen und ein Gerät zu erstellen, das die Uhrzeit, den Blutzuckerspiegel und die Entwicklungsrichtung auf dem Display in großen, leicht lesbaren Buchstaben anzeigt.</p><p>Wenn Du an Diabetes leidest und keine Ahnung hast, worüber ich oben gesprochen habe, schlage ich vor, dass Du dich über folgende Themen informierst:</p><p>- Pumpen (Wäre das eine Lösung für mich?)</p><p>- kontinuierliche Blutzuckermesssysteme wie CGM-Systeme oder FGM-Systeme (mit einigen Optimierungen)</p><p>- das Nightscout-Projekt: es bringt Ihre Daten in die Cloud und ermöglicht den geräteübergreifenden Zugriff und webbasierte Berichterstellung</p><p>Die mit diesem Projekt eingeführte Blutzuckeruhr hängt von der Verwendung des Nightscout-Projekts zur Speicherung Ihrer kontinuierlichen Blutzuckerspiegel ab, die von einem CMG- oder FGM-System stammen. Diese Werte werden durch eine zwingend vorhandene WLAN-Internetverbindung (ein stationärer WLAN-Router wird empfohlen) von der Uhr verwendet.</p><h3>Verzichterklärung:</h3><p>Bitte triff keine therapeutischen Entscheidungen basierend auf der Anzeige des Geräts. Wenn Du es dennoch tust, dann auf eigene Gefahr. Dies ist kein medizinisches Gerät und entspricht nicht den medizinischen Standards oder Vorschriften.</p><h3>Technische Vorraussetzungen:</h3><p>Es muss Nightscout mit diesem Projekt verwendet werden. Benötigt werden eine WiFi-Internetverbindung und ein Mobiltelefon mit Android (iOS (Apple) bis 4.000 € Stretchgoal), um das Gerät zu konfigurieren. Außerdem muss ein Setup bestehen, das Ihre CGM / FCM-Blutzuckerwerte in Nightscout hochlädt.</p><h3>Was du bekommst:</h3><p>Wir haben die Uhr ohne Knöpfe gestaltet. Die Konfiguration erfolgt über eine Android (iOS (Apple) bis 4.000 € Stretchgoal) ""Steuerungs-App"", die kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt wird. Aufgrund der Willkür von Apple hinsichtlich der Akzeptanz von Apps, die auf ihren Plattformen erstellt wurden, können wir die Veröffentlichung der iOS (Apple) -Version nicht garantieren, auch wenn dies durchaus wahrscheinlich ist.</p><h3>Produktmerkmale:</h3><p>- Android-Bluetooth-Steuerungs-App (Apple als Stretchgoal)</p><p>- konfigurierbares Zeitfomat (12h / 24h)</p><p>- konfigurierbare Zeitzone</p><p>- die Zeit wird aus dem Internet bezogen</p><p>- die Farbe der Schrift ist über die App veränderbar</p><p>- die Helligkeit des Displays ist über die App konfigurierbar</p><p>- Die automatische Helligkeitsanpassung ist optional und kann über die App eingestellt werden</p><p>Die Blutzuckeruhr kann über das Internet aktualisiert werden. Das gilt auch für die ausgelieferten Prototypen.</p><p>Wir liefern die Uhren in der Reihenfolge der Indigogo-Backing-Nummer (prototype pledge levels haben ein früheres Lieferdatum). Die Montage ist ein manueller Vorgang.</p><p>Der Versand wird separat über den Pledgemanager abgerechnet.</p><p>Wir werden kostenlose Farboptionen (mindestens eine) und optional eine Zusatzfarbe während des Pledgemanagerprozesses anbieten. Wir haben uns noch nicht entschieden, welche Möglichkeiten es geben wird. Des Weiteren haben wir ebenso noch nicht endgültig entschieden welches Material für das Gehäuse verwendet wird. Die Entscheidung hängt auch von der Anzahl der verkauften Geräte ab. Bei weniger als 100 Geräten verwenden wir vorzugsweise unseren 3D-Drucker zur Herstellung der Gehäuse. Wir werden einen zweiten Druckers bei 50 verkauften Geräten hinzufügen. Mit 100 verkauften Geräten erwägen wir die Auslagerung der Gehäusefertigung an eine Spritzgussfabrik. Dies würde sich negativ auf den Zeitplan des Projekts auswirken, die Qualität der Gehäuse jedoch drastisch verbessern.</p><p>Hinweis: Höchstwahrscheinlich wird das Gehäuse aus einem 3D-Drucker hergestellt und wird somit nicht das Gefühl und die Qualität haben, die Du von industriell hergestellten Kunststoffen kennst. Wenn wir uns für die Verwendung von PLA als Kunststoff für den 3D-Drucker entscheiden, sollte das Gehäuse keinen Temperaturen über 70 ° C und keinem direkten Sonnenlicht ausgesetzt werden. Daher wäre dieses Gerät in Deinem Auto nicht gut aufgehoben. Wir arbeiten noch daran, den Produktions- und Vorproduktionsprozess zu optimieren.</p><p>Das Gerät wird über einen 5-V-Micro-USB-Anschluss mit Strom versorgt. Der Netzstecker und die Kabel werden nicht mit dem Gerät geliefert. Vorraussichtlich wird ein passendes Netzteil mit deutschem Anschluss und Kabel als kleine Erweiterung über den Pledgemanager zu erwerben sein. Ein normaler USB-Stecker (1 A reicht aus) und ein Micro-USB-Kabel (die meisten Telefone verwenden diesen Anschluss!) sind in den meisten Haushalten bereits vorhanden und müssen nicht extra angeschafft werden.</p><h3>aktueller Stand des Projekts:</h3><p>Wir haben die Hardware fertiggestellt, die wir einsetzen wollen. Dazu gehört eine Mikroprozessorplatine mit Bluetooth und WLAN und geringem Energieverbrauch. Wir haben ein 2,8 ""-Farb-TFT-Display für ein modernes Display und eine fotoempfindliche LED (Fotosensor) gewählt, um eine entsprechende Helligkeitskonfiguration zu ermöglichen. Wir speichern die Konfiguration derzeit im Code. Wir können bereits Blutzuckerwerte und -entwicklungen von einer SSL-verschlüsselten Nightscout-Seite lesen und anzeigen. Wir haben das Gehäuse-Design fast fertiggestellt. Wir müssen lediglich die Passform der Mikroprozessorplatine und den Zugriff auf den USB-Stromstecker optimieren. Außerdem ist noch offen herauszufinden, welche Schrauben geeignet sind. Mit der Uhr stellen wir bisher eine Bluetooth-Beispielverbindung her und haben den Code für den Firmware-Aktualisierungsprozess vorbereitet.</p><h3>Unser Team:</h3><p>Wir haben ein kleines Büro in der Region Hannover.

You need a WiFi  internet connection and a mobile phone with Android (iOS (Apple) through  4.000€ stretch goal)  to configure the device. You need any setup that  uploads your CGM/FCM blood glucose levels to Nightscout.What you will get:We designed the clock without any buttons. So the configuration will  be done through an android (iOS (Apple) through 4.000€ stretch goal)  ""control app"" that is supplied free of charge. Due to Apple's  arbitrariness regarding the acceptance of apps created on their  platforms, we cannot guarantee the release of the iOS (Apple) version  even though it is quite probable.Product Features:- Android Bluetooth control app (Apple stretch goal)- 12h/24h clock configurable- time zone configurable- time is taken from an internet source- colour changeable through app- brightness configurable through app- automatic brightness levelling is optional and configurable through the appThe blood sugar clock will be updatable via internet. This will also apply to the prototypes.We will deliver the clocks in the order of the indigogo backing  number (prototype pledge levels have an earlier delivery date). The assembly is a manual process.The shipping will be charged separately through the pledge manager process.We will offer free colour options (at least one) and optionally addon  colouring during the pledge manager process. We have not decided, yet  what the options will be. We have also not decided, yet, on the casing's  material. This will also be dependent on the number of devices we sell.  Under 100 devices we prefer to use our 3D printer to produce the  casings. We will consider buying a second one with 50 devices sold. With  100 devices sold we will consider outsourcing the case production to a  moulding lab. This would impact the project's timetable negatively but  improve the casings quality drastically.Note: Most likely the casing will be 3D printer produced and will not  have the feel and quality you are accustomed to with industrial  manufactured plastics. If we choose the use PLA as the 3D printer  plastic the casing should not be subjected to temperatures above 70°C  and not to direct sunlight. Therefore PLA would be a bad material to  have in your car. We are still working on optimizing the production and  pre-production process.The device is powered by a 5V micro USB port. The power plug and  cables are not supplied with the device. We might add these as a small  add-on through the pledge manager. A usual USB (1 A is sufficient) power  plug and micro USB cable (most phones use these!) are already found in  most households.State of the project  We have finalized the hardware that we want to employ. This  includes a microprocessor board with Bluetooth and WiFi and low energy  consumption. We chose a 2.8"" colour TFT display for a modern display and a  photo sensitive LED (photo sensor) to allow a sourrounding matching  brightness configuration. We are currently storing the configuration in  the code and are able to read & display blood glucose levels and  development directions from an SSL encrypted nightscout page. We have  almost finished the casing design. Mainly we need optimize the fitting  of the microprocessor board and the access to the USB power plug. We  also need to figure out which screws may be suitable. We have set up a  sample Bluetooth connection and we have prepared code for the firmware  update process.The TeamWe have a small office in the Hanover region. Our project team consists of Jens: lead senior software developer with a diploma in computer science. Anna Lena: junior software developer (does most of the work ;-) ) Sonja: Marketing  Hannes: CAD case designThe Company The company ""ibis-IT"" is operating since 2011 engaging in very different software and small hardware projects. We are currently in transition changing the legal form of the company. The project is operated by the newly founded ""ibis-IT UG (haftungsbeschränkt)"". Most likely by the time of delivery the suffix UG will replaced with GmbH which is a legal form of the same time with higher authorized capital. Jens is the CEO of the company.Side note: The whole setup of Jens' open loop system- Sooil Dana-R pump (newest Version is Dana-RS!)- Dexcom G5 CGM System (switching to G6 in 2019)- Android mobile phone OnePlus 5T using X-Drip for reading CGM values  and AndroidAPS for the closed loop and pump control.- Sony Smart Watch 2 as an additional blood sugar display- Blood sugar clock on the night table ;-)Thank you for your support and thank you to the open source  community especially the individuals involved providing us with such  such great tools as Nightscout, OpenAPS, AndroidAPS and xDrip!!!revealed Stretch Goals:4.000 €: iOS Control App5.000 €: add second 3D-Printer to the production line6.000 €: support minor switchable themes or backgroundsShipping Costs, Taxes & Customs:All shipping costs will be added post-campaign.

Ich wurde 1994 im Alter von 14 Jahren mit Diabetes (Mellitus) Typ 1 diagnostiziert. Seitdem habe ich viele Verbesserungen durch die Innovation von neuen Medikamenten und neuen technischen Hilfsmitteln zur Unterstützung der Diabetestherapie miterlebt. Die neuesten Fortschritte waren für mich bahnbrechend: Im Januar 2018 wechselte ich zu einer Pumpe und einem CGM-Sensor, der alle 5 Minuten meinen Blutzuckerspiegel überprüft. Im Februar 2018 habe ich mit meinem Android-Handy ein Regelungssystem (""The Loop"") eingerichtet. Das hatte enorme Folgen, da jetzt mein Blutzuckerspiegel sehr nahe an den Werten eines Nicht-Diabetikers ohne schwere Hypoglykämien (zu wenig Zucker im Blut) und mit einem geringeren Anteil an nicht schweren Hypoglykämien lag. Dadurch ist mein Alltag sehr viel komfortabler und vor allem sicherer geworden. Jetzt kann ich meinen Blutzuckerspiegel sogar auf meiner Armbanduhr ablesen.Obwohl der Loop einen recht gut und sicher durch die Nacht bringt, wacht man manchmal auf und fragt sich, wie sein Blutzuckerspiegel aussehen könnte. Da ich meine Armbanduhr über Nacht nicht trage, war das eine unschöne Komfortlücke in der Nacht. Ich musste also mein Handy auf dem Nachttisch suchen und dann versuchen, den Zuckerspiegel mit verschlafenen Augen abzulesen. Ich beschloss, diese Lücke zu schließen und ein Gerät zu erstellen, das die Uhrzeit, den Blutzuckerspiegel und die Entwicklungsrichtung auf dem Display in großen, leicht lesbaren Buchstaben anzeigt.Wenn Du an Diabetes leidest und keine Ahnung hast, worüber ich oben gesprochen habe, schlage ich vor, dass Du dich über folgende Themen informierst:- Pumpen (Wäre das eine Lösung für mich?)- kontinuierliche Blutzuckermesssysteme wie CGM-Systeme oder FGM-Systeme (mit einigen Optimierungen)- das Nightscout-Projekt: es bringt Ihre Daten in die Cloud und ermöglicht den geräteübergreifenden Zugriff und webbasierte BerichterstellungDie mit diesem Projekt eingeführte Blutzuckeruhr hängt von der Verwendung des Nightscout-Projekts zur Speicherung Ihrer kontinuierlichen Blutzuckerspiegel ab, die von einem CMG- oder FGM-System stammen. Diese Werte werden durch eine zwingend vorhandene WLAN-Internetverbindung (ein stationärer WLAN-Router wird empfohlen) von der Uhr verwendet.Verzichterklärung:Bitte triff keine therapeutischen Entscheidungen basierend auf der Anzeige des Geräts. Wenn Du es dennoch tust, dann auf eigene Gefahr. Dies ist kein medizinisches Gerät und entspricht nicht den medizinischen Standards oder Vorschriften.Technische Vorraussetzungen:Es muss Nightscout mit diesem Projekt verwendet werden. Benötigt werden eine WiFi-Internetverbindung und ein Mobiltelefon mit Android (iOS (Apple) bis 4.000 € Stretchgoal), um das Gerät zu konfigurieren. Außerdem muss ein Setup bestehen, das Ihre CGM / FCM-Blutzuckerwerte in Nightscout hochlädt.Was du bekommst:Wir haben die Uhr ohne Knöpfe gestaltet. Die Konfiguration erfolgt über eine Android (iOS (Apple) bis 4.000 € Stretchgoal) ""Steuerungs-App"", die kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt wird. Aufgrund der Willkür von Apple hinsichtlich der Akzeptanz von Apps, die auf ihren Plattformen erstellt wurden, können wir die Veröffentlichung der iOS (Apple) -Version nicht garantieren, auch wenn dies durchaus wahrscheinlich ist.Produktmerkmale:- Android-Bluetooth-Steuerungs-App (Apple als Stretchgoal)- konfigurierbares Zeitfomat (12h / 24h)- konfigurierbare Zeitzone- die Zeit wird aus dem Internet bezogen- die Farbe der Schrift ist über die App veränderbar- die Helligkeit des Displays ist über die App konfigurierbar- Die automatische Helligkeitsanpassung ist optional und kann über die App eingestellt werdenDie Blutzuckeruhr kann über das Internet aktualisiert werden. Das gilt auch für die ausgelieferten Prototypen.Wir liefern die Uhren in der Reihenfolge der Indigogo-Backing-Nummer (prototype pledge levels haben ein früheres Lieferdatum). Die Montage ist ein manueller Vorgang.Der Versand wird separat über den Pledgemanager abgerechnet.Wir werden kostenlose Farboptionen (mindestens eine) und optional eine Zusatzfarbe während des Pledgemanagerprozesses anbieten. Wir haben uns noch nicht entschieden, welche Möglichkeiten es geben wird. Des Weiteren haben wir ebenso noch nicht endgültig entschieden welches Material für das Gehäuse verwendet wird. Die Entscheidung hängt auch von der Anzahl der verkauften Geräte ab. Bei weniger als 100 Geräten verwenden wir vorzugsweise unseren 3D-Drucker zur Herstellung der Gehäuse. Wir werden einen zweiten Druckers bei 50 verkauften Geräten hinzufügen. Mit 100 verkauften Geräten erwägen wir die Auslagerung der Gehäusefertigung an eine Spritzgussfabrik. Dies würde sich negativ auf den Zeitplan des Projekts auswirken, die Qualität der Gehäuse jedoch drastisch verbessern.Hinweis: Höchstwahrscheinlich wird das Gehäuse aus einem 3D-Drucker hergestellt und wird somit nicht das Gefühl und die Qualität haben, die Du von industriell hergestellten Kunststoffen kennst. Wenn wir uns für die Verwendung von PLA als Kunststoff für den 3D-Drucker entscheiden, sollte das Gehäuse keinen Temperaturen über 70 ° C und keinem direkten Sonnenlicht ausgesetzt werden. Daher wäre dieses Gerät in Deinem Auto nicht gut aufgehoben. Wir arbeiten noch daran, den Produktions- und Vorproduktionsprozess zu optimieren.Das Gerät wird über einen 5-V-Micro-USB-Anschluss mit Strom versorgt. Der Netzstecker und die Kabel werden nicht mit dem Gerät geliefert. Vorraussichtlich wird ein passendes Netzteil mit deutschem Anschluss und Kabel als kleine Erweiterung über den Pledgemanager zu erwerben sein. Ein normaler USB-Stecker (1 A reicht aus) und ein Micro-USB-Kabel (die meisten Telefone verwenden diesen Anschluss!) sind in den meisten Haushalten bereits vorhanden und müssen nicht extra angeschafft werden.aktueller Stand des Projekts:Wir haben die Hardware fertiggestellt, die wir einsetzen wollen. Dazu gehört eine Mikroprozessorplatine mit Bluetooth und WLAN und geringem Energieverbrauch. Wir haben ein 2,8 ""-Farb-TFT-Display für ein modernes Display und eine fotoempfindliche LED (Fotosensor) gewählt, um eine entsprechende Helligkeitskonfiguration zu ermöglichen. Wir speichern die Konfiguration derzeit im Code. Wir können bereits Blutzuckerwerte und -entwicklungen von einer SSL-verschlüsselten Nightscout-Seite lesen und anzeigen. Wir haben das Gehäuse-Design fast fertiggestellt. Wir müssen lediglich die Passform der Mikroprozessorplatine und den Zugriff auf den USB-Stromstecker optimieren. Außerdem ist noch offen herauszufinden, welche Schrauben geeignet sind. Mit der Uhr stellen wir bisher eine Bluetooth-Beispielverbindung her und haben den Code für den Firmware-Aktualisierungsprozess vorbereitet.Unser Team:Wir haben ein kleines Büro in der Region Hannover. Unser Projektteam besteht aus:Jens: leitender Softwareentwickler mit einem Dimploma in der Informatik.Anna Lena: Junior Software Entwickler (erledigt die meiste Arbeit ;-))Sonja: MarketingHannes: CAD-Design des GehäusesDas Unternehmen:Das Unternehmen bearbeitet seit 2011 sehr unterschiedliche Software- und Hardware-Projekte. Wir befinden uns derzeit im Übergang und ändern die Rechtsform des Unternehmens. Das Projekt wird von der neu gegründeten ""ibis-IT UG (haftungsbeschränkt)"" betrieben. Höchstwahrscheinlich wird das Suffix UG zum Zeitpunkt der Lieferung durch GmbH ersetzt, die lediglich eine Rechtsform mit höherem eingelegtem Kapital darstellt. Jens ist der Geschäftsführer des Unternehmens.Vielleicht auch interessant:Das gesamte Setup von Jens 'Open Loop System:- Sooil Dana-R Pumpe (neueste Version ist Dana-RS!)- Dexcom G5 CGM System (2019 auf G6 umgestellt)- Android-Mobiltelefon OnePlus 5T mit X-Drip zum Lesen von CGM-Werten und AndroidAPS für die Regelung der geschlossenen Schleife und der Pumpe.- Sony Smart Watch 2 als zusätzliche Blutzuckeranzeige- Blutzuckeruhr auf dem Nachttisch ;-)Vielen Dank für Eure Unterstützung und vielen Dank an die Open-Source-Community, insbesondere an die beteiligten Personen, die uns so großartige Tools wie Nightscout, OpenAPS, AndroidAPS und xDrip zur Verfügung stellen !!!Veröffentlichte Stretchgoals:4.000 €: iOS Control App5.000 €: Fügen wir der Produktionslinie einen zweiten 3D-Drucker hinzu6.000 €: Unterstützung kleinerer umschaltbarer Themes und/oder Hintergründe der UhrVersandkosten, Steuern und ZollDie Versandkosten werden nach der Kampagne hinzugefügt und gesondert abgerechnet.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Pierre LAMY.</p>
<p>I'm the founder of Yoonoz' Original Nose Vaporizer Brand ! I've designed the first ever Patent-Pending nose vaporizer for aromatherapy, essential oils, Eliquids and...well... all your mind can imagine!</p>
<p>I'm truly proud to finally be able to release to all of you what i know is something really big, unique and i dare say historical !</p>
<p>Indeed, It's not everyday that, not only one does discover a mostly forgotten device and  method of intake used for centuries, but also does re-engineer it to a whole new, healthier, tastier, smoother, more efficient and versatile level !</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Let me first tell you how it all started as we actually have a real cool story to tell !</p>
<p>Truth be told, i stumbled upon this idea while thinking about how to bypass ""regular""  smoke/vapor intake through the mouth, as i am very sensitive to dryness of the mouth and its negative effects on gums and buccal health in general.</p>
<p>It was a daily concern to me, until one day as i was re-reading a classic book written by R.E Schultes ( the real life inspiration for ""Indiana Jones"" , famed biologist/ethnobotanist/historian/adventurer/professor) and called ""Plants of the Gods"". Inside a tiny picture caught my attention: a drawing of a nose-pipe.</p>
<p>I never knew that Native-American/South-American cultures had commonly used nose-pipes for hundreds, if not thousands of years, depending on historians.</p>
<p>A nose-pipe?!? Could that be the answer i was searching for to solve my problem?</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Scouring the internet, i couldn't find much informations on the history of nose pipes and certainly could not find one company offering any modern form of it... but i still managed to find a few historical gems! Besides some rare and fascinating articles written by History Geeks, one was a quote i found from Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo, Governor of Hispaniola (an island near Haïti), describing how the “evil practice” of smoking by locals, was back in 1525:<br/><br/>“Their chiefs employ a pipe filled with the lighted weed, inserting the forked extremities into their nostrils. . . . In this way they imbibe the smoke until they become unconscious and lie sprawling on the ground like men in a drunken slumber.”</p>
<p>The original design of these nose-pipes looked obviously highly unpractical to use, made in clay and most of all were using combustion to produce the smoke, resulting in what probably was a highly unpleasant experience for the nose...not good...but it seemed to be pretty efficient in its effects and one thing was for certain:  Indigenous tribes were not using this method for fun or by mistakes: it clearly was a route that was deemed worthwile even though it clearly had rough drawbacks  as it was and  mouth-pipes were available to use...</p>

<p> </p>
<p>That's when it all clicked and i got the idea for our original design!  A ""tuning key"" pyrex glass nose-pipe, provided it had the proper ""cool off"" length, tube diametre and nostrils spacing, would not only be easy to use but it would eliminate combustion and allow for fully controlable vaporization just by heating below the glass bowl !</p>
<p>It seemed so logical! Absolutely no one was offering anything like it! Until now!</p>

THIS is the First Nose Vaporizer Ever ! by Yoonoz.
 

 
Let me first tell you how it all started as we actually have a real cool story to tell !
Truth be told, i stumbled upon this idea while thinking about how to bypass ""regular""  smoke/vapor intake through the mouth, as i am very sensitive to dryness of the mouth and its negative effects on gums and buccal health in general.
It was a daily concern to me, until one day as i was re-reading a classic book written by R.E Schultes ( the real life inspiration for ""Indiana Jones"" , famed biologist/ethnobotanist/historian/adventurer/professor) and called ""Plants of the Gods"". Inside a tiny picture caught my attention: a drawing of a nose-pipe.
I never knew that Native-American/South-American cultures had commonly used nose-pipes for hundreds, if not thousands of years, depending on historians.
A nose-pipe?!? Could that be the answer i was searching for to solve my problem?
 

 
Scouring the internet, i couldn't find much informations on the history of nose pipes and certainly could not find one company offering any modern form of it... but i still managed to find a few historical gems! Besides some rare and fascinating articles written by History Geeks, one was a quote i found from Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo, Governor of Hispaniola (an island near Haïti), describing how the “evil practice” of smoking by locals, was back in 1525:“Their chiefs employ a pipe filled with the lighted weed, inserting the forked extremities into their nostrils. . . .

Why our Nose Vaporizer is Great (and it just makes sens) :
As far as efficacy is concerned, the nasal mucous being an outstanding absorption tool, then combined with ""regular"" absorption through the lungs, seems to be the reason for the punch-packing potency and efficiency described earlier.
In fact, science says that your nose is the best tool for detecting tastes. So basically, no nose = no taste ! Your mouth and tongue can only detect very general categories like salty, sweet, bitter etc..but all the ""fine tunings"" come from the combination with nose!
Ever had a bad cold that left you unable to taste the foods you were trying to eat? Yep...Ever tried to swallow a bad tasting medicine as a kid? didn't you pinch your nose? Yep...
Our design eliminates the harshness of combustion and allows you for the first time to vaporize a quasi infinite number of essentials oils, Eliquids, medicinal plants and mixes inhaled straight to your nose for the best results possible !
At Yoonoz we really feel that our mission is to offer people a better, healthier, more modern, versatile and useful version of a long forgotten classic  that has been a part of Mankind's heritage since almost the dawn of time.

Some cryobanks store human samples such as stem cells that are later used for research or treatment of various types of cancers.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">These facilities typically have a cryopreservation unit, which is used for the actual storage of the materials. Many use liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissues or cells, which lowers the temperature below freezing and keeps the cells viable for research or other applications.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Materials are carefully prepared before they are put through the freezing process, in which water molecules within the samples are frozen. There is typically a loss of some tissues, but the majority of the sample remains intact for as long as it is frozen. Since the purity of each sample is of vital importance, most cryobanks do not put the liquid nitrogen in direct contact with the sample in order to freeze it. Instead, samples are put in freezers and kept separate from the liquid nitrogen, frozen by the temperature of the environment instead.</p><h3>Neurofeedback</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>What is Neurofeedback?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Neurofeedback is an exercise for the brain! Neurofeedback, also called qEEG Biofeedback is a state-of-the-art, non-invasive method for teaching the brain to function in a more balanced and healthful way. It does so by shifting the way the brain produces and distributes its electrical energy. Four divisions of electrical impulses made by our brain, Delta, Theta, Alpha, and Beta are called “Frequency Bands”. These Frequency Bands tell us which parts of your brain are active and which frequency bands the brain should be using to complete a given task or activity. For instance, when we are balancing our checkbooks or in a class following directions, certain areas of our brain will need to be active and using the faster frequency called Beta. On the other hand, if after a long day we wish to relax and wind down, a different part of the brain will need to be activated using the slower brain wave frequency called Alpha. The goal of Neurofeedback is to improve the brain’s ability to self-regulate, maintain flexibility, and smoothly shift between states of relaxation and arousal. Since the Brain also controls Attention Regulation, Emotional Regulation and Affect Regulation, this ultimately allows the entire Central Nervous System to resume normal functioning.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>How is Neurofeedback Done?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Sensors are placed on the head and ears to record the brain wave activity. High-tech equipment amplifies the electrical impulses and breaks them into the four key frequency bands. Using sophisticated computer software a customized protocol is developed to address the individual’s unique needs. During the session, the Neurofeedback Clinician views the raw qEEG signal as well as the chosen frequency bands. Exercises are typically performed with eyes open. With eyes open, the Client is watching a video or playing a game. The video fades in and out depending on whether or not the brain is increasing the desired frequencies and decreasing other frequencies. At the conclusion of the 30 Minute training period, the Clinician shares and discusses the Training Review Screen.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Why Does Neurofeedback Work?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Neurofeedback takes advantage of the brain’s ability to change itself through a process known as Neuroplasticity. It utilizes the same learning process that occurs whenever we acquire a new skill. The brain learns by forming connections between nerve cells and utilizing important pathways that connect different locations in the brain. The more frequently you utilize these pathways the better the brain becomes at performing the associated task. In psychology, this type of learning is called “Operant Conditioning”. It is a type of learning in which responses come to be controlled by their consequences. Quite simply, Neurofeedback offers the perfect learning conditions, since it facilitates awareness of when the brain is producing healthier brainwave patterns, provides reinforcement for the positive change and multiple opportunities to provide practice during a training session.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Who Can Benefit from Neurofeedback?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Everyone can benefit from brain mapping.

This is just one of the many components that set our clinic apart. Just a few of the conditions that have been treated are arthritis, asthma, autoimmune, cardiomyopathy, CIDP, CODP, Crohn’s disease, degenerative spine and disk disease, Lichen Sclerosis, Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis, Muscular Dystrophy, Myasthenia Gravis, Neuropathy, Ophthalmology conditions, orthopedics, Parkinson’s disease, Peyronies disease, relapsing polychondritis, Scleroderma, stroke recovery and urological conditions.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>How is Stem Cell Therapy Done?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are now in a new era of medicine. Our bodies are made up of dozens of trillions of cells. Up until now, medicine was predominantly aimed at keeping our cells healthy and alive through diet, exercise, medications to eradicate disease, or supplements to help our cells stay healthy, but now, going forward, we have the opportunity to replace injured or dying cells with our own DNA coded stem cells. These cells can not cause an allergic response or be rejected. While many people consider this experimental, we really consider it investigational but not really experimental. This may be a NEW era in medicine, but it really reflects perhaps the OLDEST form of intervention. Before we had any kind of medical intervention we had to rely on our body’s natural cell defense to keep us healthy. We now have the ability to unlock and harvest huge quantities of these repair cells for immediate use and, further, we can send samples to our lab where they can be cryopreserved and expanded as millions of stem cells for later use. Indeed, we have coined the term CRT – Cell Renewal Therapy – to describe how we foresee the future of medicine whereby your natural “spare parts” in the form of your own DNA cultivated stem cells will be made available to keep your body healthy and extend longevity for years beyond anything ever imaginable.</span></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Stem cells are basically unspecialized cells that can replicate and differentiate (i.e. turn into other specialized cells). They tend to have three basic properties: 1) anti-inflammatory; 2) immune-modulatory and 3) reparative or regenerative. Most people think an embryo is the most common source for stem cells. While most stem cell studies started by using embryos, there are a number of issues and problems associated with their use. Not only are there ethical concerns, embryonic stem cells can sometimes form tumors (i.e. teratomas).</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">There are also a lot of stem cells naturally found in our body. Most people are aware of bone marrow derived stem cells. In recent years, bone marrow has been a source for stem cells particularly for orthopedic conditions. However, stem cell yields in bone marrow tend to be between 50,000 and 200,000 with some of the newer technology. Adipose (fat) tissue also houses vast quantities of stem cells. In fact, just 30 cc’s (2 tablespoons) of fat can yield between 10 and 30 million stem cells.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our fat derived stem cells have a tremendous capacity to turn into a large variety of tissues. Originally, because of their “mesenchymal” origin, we thought they could only turn into fat, cartilage, bone, muscle, connective tissue, blood vessels and nerve tissue, but now we have studies showing they’ve turned into practically every kind of cell in the body. While the “bone marrow” proponents will sing the virtues of bone marrow stem cells for cartilage repair, it turns out that fat derived cells are an even greater source for cartilage repair and production. Compared to a bone marrow harvest, it’s so simple to harvest a little fat and the yields are generally very high making fat an ideal source for stem cells.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Initial studies made SAFETY the primary objective and the clinical outcomes a secondary objective. Our safety study of over 1,500 patients has shown that there are no significant adverse events related to the deployment of SVF. Indeed, the only real issues have been some mild discomfort around the liposuction site – something we naturally expect.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">While there are a growing number of doctors claiming to provide stem cell treatments, we believe the most ethical approach is to do it under the umbrella of IRB approved research protocols. An IRB is an Institutional Review Board or an organization of members responsible for approving and overseeing research on humans. IRBs are approved under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Human Research Protection. As such, our patients understand the investigational nature of our activities, are provided appropriate informed consents and are followed continuously on an online database to chart their progress or any issues of concern. This will allow us to not only accumulate safety data but demonstrate the effectiveness of treatments and help us to improve treatment programs going forward.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We already have a number of very innovative treatments in progress. For example, one of our approved studies involves deployment of cells via an Ommaya reservoir. This is a device that connects a port under the scalp via a tube directly into the ventricle of the brain where cells can be added to the cerebral spinal fluid. This concept evolved by working with renown Brain Surgeon, Christopher Duma, MD, FACS. It was preceded by safety studies on laboratory rats and 30 patients later are showing some significant progress.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As you can imagine, with “new” technologies, patients often come to you when they’ve exhausted most other traditional treatments. We’ve now had a lot of experience to understand how well cell therapy can work even though we’re continuing to gather data and look for ways of optimizing treatments. So, for example, most patients with arthritic knees will consider stem cell deployment after they’ve tried pain medication, steroids, hyaluronan injections and even arthroscopy. None of these are actually treatments that repair the problem but rather mask the pain or temporize the situation. If there’s cartilage in the knee then it can potentially signal your stem cells to repair the joint. We now understand that acute injuries probably respond better than chronic ones because there are more messages (cytokines) directing and instructing the stem cells into action and repair. Still, until we have enough data and publish enough articles to support these positions our concepts remain “conjecture” waiting to be proven.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Patients are also concerned about whether these procedures are FDA approved. Technically, the FDA only approves drugs and devices. We’re actually performing a surgical procedure and the FDA does not approve surgery. However, we are working with the FDA to have our system evaluated for potential FDA approval. Our initial FDA studies will be aimed at knee arthritis with the goal to show autologous SVF is more effective than a placebo. This will be done with a “double blind controlled study.” I doubt we will do FDA studies for every potential condition rather, doctors will ultimately gather data and/or do their own research and accumulate results to support the positive use of SVF for a large host of inflammatory and degenerative conditions.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>How Long Will It Take to See Results from Stem Cell Therapy?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">There are many variables that contribute to your results;  your overall health, any underlying conditions, nutrition and state of mind.

<p><strong>What is UniBand?</strong></p>
<p>UniBand is a wristband that clearly communicates the wearer's body temperature to those around them. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605057091/gm0jpypmcne1awyrgxer.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why is UniBand necessary?</strong></p>
<p>Current infrared temperature sensors used by businesses are notoriously unreliable and inaccurate (see <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/business/coronavirus-temperature-sensor-guns.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this</a> New York Times article). Customers walk in and out of stores from all entrances - how confident are you that they’ve been screened?

<p><strong>Yellow</strong>: Advisory Zone -&gt; Temperature between 99.5°F to 100.4°F</p>
<p><strong>Red</strong>: Symptomatic Zone -&gt; Temperature above 100.4°F</p>
<p>In our studies, we found that onlookers understood UniBand’s purpose immediately, and made them feel safer as it increased awareness of other's body temperature. The UniBand retails at an affordable price--cheaper than a pack of masks--and becomes even more beneficial as more people wear it.</p>

Indoor/outdoor environmentally-friendly heating system? It's about time!


Enfin un système de
chauffage outdoor et indoor écologique du 21 ème siècle!


Thank you for making the
MURCHO the biggest “Pleasure of Living” success of all time on INDIEGOGO!

Merci de faire de MURCHO le plus grand succès du plaisir de vivre de
tous les temps sur INDIEGOGO! 


An indoor/outdoor
environmentally-friendly solar heating system! 
Un système solaire de
chauffage outdoor et indoor écologique!

Have you ever felt cold…


On a restaurant terrace?

In your garage/workshop?

On your patio?

In your open-concept office?

At an event in a tent?

On the beach at night?

In a train or bus station?

At a camp ground?
At the cottage?
N'avez-vous jamais eu froid...

Indoor/outdoor heating
systems are often expensive, dependent on the main power grid, and harmful to
the environment—not to mention difficult to carry around with you! 
Tous les systèmes de chauffage outdoor et indoor sont coûteux,
dépendants du réseau électrique, sont polluants, non écologiques.... et surtout
ils ne sont pas tous transportables pour vos loisirs !
The Murcho is a
solar-powered radiant wall. In addition to keeping you warm, it’s an attractive
addition to your patio or deck. You can leave it on, day and night, all winter
and summer long. As soon as you feel a little cold, turn on your MURCHO to
create some heat, effectively and safely.
Murcho fonctionne grâce à la chaleur du soleil! C'est un mur radiant. Il
vous chauffera le corps pour votre bien-être. Il est beau et esthétique sur
votre terrasse. Vous pouvez le laisser fonctionner jour et nuit, hiver et été.
Dès que vous aurez froid, allumez votre MURCHO et vous serez au chaud et sans
danger.


Sun warms the solar
heating panels
Cold liquid flows to the
panels
Heated liquid flows to
the MURCHO
The MURCHO heats the
environment through radiation
The MURCHO does not
create air movement, but uses infrared radiation to transmit heat directly to
the body, regardless of the ambient temperature 
The cooled liquid flows
back into the boiler tank


The liquid is heated by the sun and flows back into the boiler tank



You can
place the MURCHO wherever you are unable to install indoor or outdoor heating. The MURCHO can also act as
a light source, and even repel bugs (lighting and bug-repellent system also
available)!
MURCHO se place partout où il n'y a pas la possibilité
de mettre un chauffage à l'intérieur où à l'extérieur. MURCHO peut aussi éclairer et éloigner les insectes nuisibles (système
d'éclairage et de repousse insectes nuisibles en supplément)!

<h1>Problem<br/>
</h1>
<p>Health care is very crucial need for a human since the start of the 
mankind. From birth to death we often need medical professionals and 
services such as doctor, nurse, hospitals, ambulance, pathology, 
medicine stores etc to be healthy, stay healthy and heal our pain. With time health industry have became one of
 the biggest industry in the world. </p>
<p>Health care is expensive but it's also common to be overcharged for it. 
Insurance coverage gaps and billing errors also play a part in high 
health care costs but the little known practice of unfair medical 
billing. </p>
<p>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449830285/nfly4rqdpspzieauofr0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>It's a terrible feeling to open a bill and find a balance that's way 
higher than you expected. But it's even worse when you are recovering 
from an illness or injury that landed you in the hospital - something 
you didn't plan and now can't afford. </p>
<p>                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449830455/o7rsvdf8rreprx71khvp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Today, medical costs have spiraled out of control for the average 
consumer. On top of this, doctors continue to recommend unnecessary 
procedures and tests, arguably to increase their own profits, and wide 
pricing discrepancies exist between physicians who offer the same 
services. Despite these trends, medical costs remains a taboo subject 
(one that consumers are hesitant to discuss openly), and talk of price 
research and cost comparison remains limited. </p>
<p>people spend all their savings, their kids education fund even take loan to get over of medical debts. It's something that completely change their financial situation even when they have medical insurance. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449831041/replsw7filu8avfl7yvm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Apart from unfair billing we have to deal with several other annoying problems when we are trying to get medical treatment.<br/></p>
<p>When you are seeking for healthcare usually those are the problems you might have to face.<br/></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Searching Correct Doctor, Hospital, Pathology etc :</b> Usually when we are sick and we don't have a family doctor or we face a health issue that we never faced before it become hard to choose a correct doctor because a dentist can't heal your heart and an cardiologist can't heal your teeth Same like a bone excerpt can advice you for fever but it will be just an advice not an specialist advice. Finding the right doctor isn't easy—and it shouldn't be. When you put 
your life in someone else's hands, you need to feel confident that this 
is an individual with enough smartness, qualifications, and skills to give 
you the treatment you deserve. To find the correct medical professional we are usually dependent on advice of friends, relatives, neighbors or not so reliable information on internet or medical directory. it makes our options limited and we have to hope that the doctor we are going to believe is actually good enough to heal us or our loved ones. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Unfair billing :</b> It could happen to anyone at anytime. A trip to the emergency room or 
bad news from your doctor could result in thousands of dollars in 
medical bills. Even with medical insurance, you may end up with 
catastrophic debt as a result of your illness. To make matters worse, 
many health care providers have unfair billing practices that only add 
to the financial issues faced by patients. Except for a few 
billionaires, every American and European (let alone the third world people) is just one major illness away from 
bankruptcy. <p>                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449915992/hiqjzujkwj81r8jkztt2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Overpriced medicine :</b> How you will be sure that the money you going to pay for the medicines are fair price for that? you can never be sure as even medics get confused by the fancy names of medicines. All you can do is to believe on the pharmacist and pay him the asked amount. This price is often unfair because commission for doctor and sales person involve in price you pay for medicines.</li>
<li>
<b>Rude hospital staff :</b> You might be expecting some sympathy and good behavior from hospital staff because you have paid or you will pay a big amount to the hospital but it's not new that we face rude behavior from hospital staff.</li>
<li>
<b>Mismatch of appointments:</b> you must be very lucky if you never had to wait for your turn to see doctor even when you have confirm appointment because most of the people have to waste hours in the clinic just to show them self to doctor face to face. Hours that they could spend doing something else.</li>
<li>
<b>Medical papers management:</b> It's very hard to manage all the medical documents like medical reports, prescriptions, x-ray etc. its usual we don't find required medical documents at the time we need them because these documents are very easy to lose.<br/>

<li>
<b>Create Website:</b> Yes we have an idea and passion to make it come true but none of our team member is a developer. we need to hire a web developing firm to develop rocktor website and app. We have already contacted few top web developing firms and the most suitable package they offer is about 20000USD for developing website and app (both Android and iOS).  We can choose a cheaper one but cheap packages will not provide us enough speed, web space, cutting edge visuals and SEO. <br/>

<b>Marketing and Promotions:</b> Does't mater how awesome rocktor would be it will be nothing but a sitting duck if no body knows about it, this is why we will have a aggressive paid marketing campaign on social media such as facebook, twitter, whatsapp etc and on search engines like Google and yahoo too. We will publish advertisements in big news papers and magazines, We will spread pamphlets, posters as well. Since we strongly believe the primary objective is to introduce rocktor to those who really need it and it's not possible without aggressive marketing so this is going to be the biggest expenditure  it will require about 40000 USD.</li>
<li>
<b>Equipment:</b> We will require some equipment like 4 computers (5000usd) Printer (150 USD) other logistical equipment (850usd)</li>
<li>
<b>Rent office space: </b>Every business/organization or a startup needs a place to operate we have already watched a suitable convenient office space for rocktor, it's cheap yet easy to reach. (1000*6=6000)</li>
<li>
<b>Other office expenses:</b> Such as stationery, Phone bills, electricity bills, Internet bills etc. (3000usd) <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Hire staff:</b> We will need following staff to maintain the platform and achieve our goals</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Developers:</b> Though we will outsource the website from web developing firm but still we will need at least two developers to maintain and keep website and apps of rocktor up to date plus we can not be dependent on web developing firm forever this is why we will need our own team for future developments and updates. it will take 1000usd each developer for at least next six months until we will start having enough visitors. (1000*2*6=12000)</li>
<li>
<b>Marketing Personal:</b> We will need 3 marketing personals at the beginning one for contacting doctors inside the city (500*6=3000) one for contacting doctors online (500*6=3000) and another one to oprate a marketing campaign on social media such as facebook, twitter, whatsapp etc (500*6=3000) .</li>

</div><div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges<br/>
</h3>
<p>Every new initiative face challenges and rocktor is not an exception. Here are few biggest challenges we will probably have and how we will solve them.</p>
<p><b>1. Already Existing platforms:</b> There are few platforms already working in the same field but instead of providing solutions to people they became a part of this nexus. </p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Because these platforms include their profit in the treatment cost it's not beneficial for patient. we will not charge anything to patients our main source of income would be advertisement and membership fee from doctors. ""Patient first"" going to be our strategy so we are going to keep medical cost as low as possible. This strategy will not only beat the other platform so fast but it will make rocktor popular between patients in no time.</p>
<p><b>2. Making rocktor popular:</b> Though rocktor going to be a game changing tool in medical world still it is going to be a big challenge to make it popular between patients from the beginning.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> To counter this problem we going to take help of a aggressive marketing campaign thanks to our contributors we will already have funds for this marketing campaign. Low cost medical cost also going to play a major role to make rocktor popular by mouth publicity. We probably will have a referral mechanism so people who benefited by rocktor can easily tell about it to their friends and family.<br/></p>
<p><b>3.Future funding:</b> As described above no business can sustain without proper and continues funding. rocktor going to have same problem too.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> For future funding needs rocktor will have it's own revenue model to generate revenue for future development and operational requirements. Our revenue model will be based on advertisement and membership fee so it will not be a burden on those who are already having trouble with money. For more details please check revenue model section. <br/></p>
<p><b>4. Competitors:</b> Yes rocktor is an unique idea but there are some players already working with somehow similar concept like medical directory etc. they tied up with hospital and make the problem even worse.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> with cheap and cost effective medical treatment rocktor will deal with those money hungry competitors itself but if it couldn't do it we have some good strategies to deal with them.</p>Apart from those we are very much aware of possible problems aret visible at the moment. we will face many problems that we haven't count yet but we believe our team and strategies are fully capable to deal with any problem.
<p><br/></p>
<h2>What if we doest reach the goal<br/>
</h2>
<p>Honestly this 100000 is not our goal, The goal way higher. This amount is just a startup amount but we believe our unique revenue model will fulfill our future need of funding but still if we couldn't reach our goal i will not let this project die. team members will take loan and sale everything what we have to ensure rocktor become a reality. Rockter is not only a project but its a dream for all of us and we will make sure this dream come true at any cost.</p>
<h2>Five reasons Rocktor going to be a success<br/>

My name is Sachin. I am here to ask for your kind support and help to solve a problem that everyone of us either experienced or will surly experience in our life. Lets use power of crowdfunding and web technology to save millions to die and millions to go bankrupt.There are thousands of blogs and website where people wrote about the problems they experienced while getting medical treatment and they are not only in asia but in developed countries of Europe too. USA also have uncountable victims of unfair medical billing and unskilled medical professionals.
See how hospitals do unfair billing
Example of Medical negligence (Unskilled medical professionals and hospital staff)
Another example of unfair medical billing and problems that one will have to face to deal with them.
Unprofessional medical billing
Problem

Health care is very crucial need for a human since the start of the 
mankind. From birth to death we often need medical professionals and 
services such as doctor, nurse, hospitals, ambulance, pathology, 
medicine stores etc to be healthy, stay healthy and heal our pain. With time health industry have became one of
 the biggest industry in the world. 
Health care is expensive but it's also common to be overcharged for it. 
Insurance coverage gaps and billing errors also play a part in high 
health care costs but the little known practice of unfair medical 
billing. 
                          

It's a terrible feeling to open a bill and find a balance that's way 
higher than you expected. But it's even worse when you are recovering 
from an illness or injury that landed you in the hospital - something 
you didn't plan and now can't afford. 
                   

Today, medical costs have spiraled out of control for the average 
consumer. On top of this, doctors continue to recommend unnecessary 
procedures and tests, arguably to increase their own profits, and wide 
pricing discrepancies exist between physicians who offer the same 
services. Despite these trends, medical costs remains a taboo subject 
(one that consumers are hesitant to discuss openly), and talk of price 
research and cost comparison remains limited. 
people spend all their savings, their kids education fund even take loan to get over of medical debts. It's something that completely change their financial situation even when they have medical insurance. 

Apart from unfair billing we have to deal with several other annoying problems when we are trying to get medical treatment.
When you are seeking for healthcare usually those are the problems you might have to face.


Searching Correct Doctor, Hospital, Pathology etc : Usually when we are sick and we don't have a family doctor or we face a health issue that we never faced before it become hard to choose a correct doctor because a dentist can't heal your heart and an cardiologist can't heal your teeth Same like a bone excerpt can advice you for fever but it will be just an advice not an specialist advice. Finding the right doctor isn't easy—and it shouldn't be. When you put 
your life in someone else's hands, you need to feel confident that this 
is an individual with enough smartness, qualifications, and skills to give 
you the treatment you deserve. To find the correct medical professional we are usually dependent on advice of friends, relatives, neighbors or not so reliable information on internet or medical directory. it makes our options limited and we have to hope that the doctor we are going to believe is actually good enough to heal us or our loved ones. 


Unfair billing : It could happen to anyone at anytime. A trip to the emergency room or 
bad news from your doctor could result in thousands of dollars in 
medical bills. Even with medical insurance, you may end up with 
catastrophic debt as a result of your illness. To make matters worse, 
many health care providers have unfair billing practices that only add 
to the financial issues faced by patients. Except for a few 
billionaires, every American and European (let alone the third world people) is just one major illness away from 
bankruptcy.                        



Overpriced medicine : How you will be sure that the money you going to pay for the medicines are fair price for that? you can never be sure as even medics get confused by the fancy names of medicines. All you can do is to believe on the pharmacist and pay him the asked amount. This price is often unfair because commission for doctor and sales person involve in price you pay for medicines.

Rude hospital staff : You might be expecting some sympathy and good behavior from hospital staff because you have paid or you will pay a big amount to the hospital but it's not new that we face rude behavior from hospital staff.

Mismatch of appointments: you must be very lucky if you never had to wait for your turn to see doctor even when you have confirm appointment because most of the people have to waste hours in the clinic just to show them self to doctor face to face. Hours that they could spend doing something else.

Medical papers management: It's very hard to manage all the medical documents like medical reports, prescriptions, x-ray etc. its usual we don't find required medical documents at the time we need them because these documents are very easy to lose.

appointment online too this is why they won't have to waste their time 
in the clinic waiting for their term, for example if they booked an 
appointment on 5pm they just need to reach the clinic on 4.45 pm and 
after 15 min. as appointment is scheduled they will be front of doctor. 


The Goal


We plan to bring 20000 individual doctors and at least 5000 hospitals on board first year. We aim to have at least 1 million appointments every month via rocktor with 100% growth every month.





With the unique concept of rocktor and aggressive marketing strategies we are aiming 5 million users first year all over the world plus 100% growth in the number of users from next year.




Future growth

No great idea survive without funds we just need your help to start it. For future requirements of funding rocktor will have it's own revenue generation model. An online platform with millions of serious visitors every month have high potential to generate revenue. we plan to generate revenue by those ways.


Advertisement sales: who won't like to market their products on a website which have millions of hits by serious paints every day. Our primary target will be medicines brands, health supplements, health food restaurants, medical equipment brands, health clubs, medical insurance providers etc.

Premium membership: We will offer premium memberships to doctors and hospitals. By subscribing premium membership they might get some vital favor to help boost their visibility on our search results. 



  What We Need

We are seeking for funds to have this revaluation in health sector. We are looking for 100000 USD. This amount sounds big but its nothing to start a google or facebook of health area and to provide something to those who suffer in lake of a medical guidance system.
The funds will be spend to :- 



Create Website: Yes we have an idea and passion to make it come true but none of our team member is a developer. we need to hire a web developing firm to develop rocktor website and app. We have already contacted few top web developing firms and the most suitable package they offer is about 20000USD for developing website and app (both Android and iOS).  We can choose a cheaper one but cheap packages will not provide us enough speed, web space, cutting edge visuals and SEO. 


Legalization: We will need around 1000 USD to legalize the platform. To from a company, it's registration and enrollment etc.

Marketing and Promotions: Does't mater how awesome rocktor would be it will be nothing but a sitting duck if no body knows about it, this is why we will have a aggressive paid marketing campaign on social media such as facebook, twitter, whatsapp etc and on search engines like Google and yahoo too. We will publish advertisements in big news papers and magazines, We will spread pamphlets, posters as well. Since we strongly believe the primary objective is to introduce rocktor to those who really need it and it's not possible without aggressive marketing so this is going to be the biggest expenditure  it will require about 40000 USD.

Equipment: We will require some equipment like 4 computers (5000usd) Printer (150 USD) other logistical equipment (850usd)

Rent office space: Every business/organization or a startup needs a place to operate we have already watched a suitable convenient office space for rocktor, it's cheap yet easy to reach. (1000*6=6000)

Other office expenses: Such as stationery, Phone bills, electricity bills, Internet bills etc. (3000usd) 


Hire staff: We will need following staff to maintain the platform and achieve our goals



Developers: Though we will outsource the website from web developing firm but still we will need at least two developers to maintain and keep website and apps of rocktor up to date plus we can not be dependent on web developing firm forever this is why we will need our own team for future developments and updates. it will take 1000usd each developer for at least next six months until we will start having enough visitors. (1000*2*6=12000)

Marketing Personal: We will need 3 marketing personals at the beginning one for contacting doctors inside the city (500*6=3000) one for contacting doctors online (500*6=3000) and another one to oprate a marketing campaign on social media such as facebook, twitter, whatsapp etc (500*6=3000) .

Accountant: We will need an accountant to maintain fair accounts about every income and expenditure so we don't feel any complication from the government. (500*6=3000)

 Risks & Challenges

Every new initiative face challenges and rocktor is not an exception. Here are few biggest challenges we will probably have and how we will solve them.
1. Already Existing platforms: There are few platforms already working in the same field but instead of providing solutions to people they became a part of this nexus. 
Solution: Because these platforms include their profit in the treatment cost it's not beneficial for patient. we will not charge anything to patients our main source of income would be advertisement and membership fee from doctors. ""Patient first"" going to be our strategy so we are going to keep medical cost as low as possible. This strategy will not only beat the other platform so fast but it will make rocktor popular between patients in no time.
2. Making rocktor popular: Though rocktor going to be a game changing tool in medical world still it is going to be a big challenge to make it popular between patients from the beginning.
Solution: To counter this problem we going to take help of a aggressive marketing campaign thanks to our contributors we will already have funds for this marketing campaign. Low cost medical cost also going to play a major role to make rocktor popular by mouth publicity. We probably will have a referral mechanism so people who benefited by rocktor can easily tell about it to their friends and family.
3.Future funding: As described above no business can sustain without proper and continues funding. rocktor going to have same problem too.
Solution: For future funding needs rocktor will have it's own revenue model to generate revenue for future development and operational requirements. Our revenue model will be based on advertisement and membership fee so it will not be a burden on those who are already having trouble with money. For more details please check revenue model section. 
4. Competitors: Yes rocktor is an unique idea but there are some players already working with somehow similar concept like medical directory etc. they tied up with hospital and make the problem even worse.
Solution: with cheap and cost effective medical treatment rocktor will deal with those money hungry competitors itself but if it couldn't do it we have some good strategies to deal with them.Apart from those we are very much aware of possible problems aret visible at the moment. we will face many problems that we haven't count yet but we believe our team and strategies are fully capable to deal with any problem.

What if we doest reach the goal

Honestly this 100000 is not our goal, The goal way higher. This amount is just a startup amount but we believe our unique revenue model will fulfill our future need of funding but still if we couldn't reach our goal i will not let this project die. team members will take loan and sale everything what we have to ensure rocktor become a reality. Rockter is not only a project but its a dream for all of us and we will make sure this dream come true at any cost.
Five reasons Rocktor going to be a success



Unique concept: Rockter is unique concept yes there are are many medical directory available on internet but none of them allow you to compare, rate, review and book online.

Solution of problem: Rockter going to solve many big problems for both patient and doctors everyone will love it.

Win Win for all: Rocktor doest harm anyone it's good for honest medical services, its good for patients and good for the operators as well.

<h4>►Sales of Golf Products  (Phase 1) &amp; Other Sports Products<br/>►A Brand Character Managed by Our Consumers<br/>►A Lot of Fun &amp; A Lot of Good Humor<br/>►Helping You Fight Cancer While Having Fun!</h4>

When it was my turn to tee off on the 15th hole it was obvious to friends I had no more balls. A witty friend was quick to respond, tossed me a ball and told me “Why don’t you slap this monkey, that’s about all your good at.” And the branding idea for a golf ball was born. A golf ball called “MonkeyBall™” and a catchy phrase “Slap Your Monkey™”</span></h4>
<p>MonkeyBall Sports captures the spirit of playing golf with friends - friends that you can cut up with and enjoy the times you have when you can let loose on the course and have a few laughs. It's about enjoying that same experience in a larger online community that contributes to choosing and experiencing our brand while enjoying a social media experience with people that love golf, a good sense of humor, and helping others.</p>
<b>Why We Feel So Strongly About Doing This </b><p>Every hour on the hour, a man is diagnosed with testicular cancer which is the leading form of cancer in men ages 15-35 but can hit at any age. Yet testicular cancer awareness and education is lacking in our society when ironically early detection leads to survivability in 95% of cases. <b><i>And testicular cancer is a monkey on the back of every man that suffers with it. </i></b>That is why we believe ""Slap Your Monkey""™ can take on a whole new meaning in the cancer community (who would'a thought ""Save the Tatas???) .</p>
<p><i>We want to make a difference by donating 10% of the profits for each MonkeyBall® golf ball sale to non-profits working to end testicular cancer. We think we can start with golf balls and branch out into tennis balls, basketballs, t-shirts, koozies etc, as we grow and succeed.</i></p>

<p>Yes I trademarked both MonkeyBall™ and “Slap Your Monkey™”. I am proud to have my name go down in history as the person who trademarked “Slap Your Monkey™” for all things balls. But it was fun, and it got A LOT of laughs. We played around with the idea for what must have been a couple of years, until finally I ran into my friend, Hunter Cressall, who loved the idea and cut this video for me <strong>for free</strong> to bring the fun to life and encouraged me to donate to a humanitarian cause along the way.</p>

<p>When I got serious about brand marketing a golf ball called “MonkeyBall™, I decided I had to stop asking friends about the idea as friends tend to tell you what you want to hear. So I ventured out to a few golf stores in Birmingham Alabama where I live (I'm a Georgia transplant) and see if I could get a rise out of anyone with the catchy phrase “Slap Your Monkey™”. I decided Dick’s Sporting Goods might be a good place to start to conduct some ad-hoc questionnaires about the brand. A few minutes at Dick’s and I blew over to another sporting goods store, and again and again until I was sure I had cracked this nut. It turns out that all the guys I approached (I was too chicken to ask any ladies) loved the idea and consistently asked me where they could get a case of MonkeyBalls™”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It wasn’t much longer after that I spent a couple of hundred bucks to test the water and conducted a survey with survata.com . The results were phenomenal – basically 60% of all polled indicated they felt strongly they would buy the ball, they believed others would buy the ball, and they even believed others would buy the ball for a friend!</p>
<p>So we cut this video to explain it (warning – a bit more serious than the one above!):</p>

<p>We think this startup has huge potential. We want to start with golf balls and golf products t(hats, tees, shirts etc.) with an initial laser like focus on golf balls as we believe this is the most promising market segment in terms of demand, acceptance of the brand, prospective profit margins, and ease of entry. Why do we believe this?</p>

<p>All manufacturing will be done by a trusted third party while quality, marketing, distribution, and back office operations will be conducted in house, by our company MonkeyBall™ Sports. We believe quality control to be imperative in our operations and will dedicate capital to compression testing, core testing, dimple adherence, and quality of printed logos. The end result is we want a high quality ball that will go the distance and perform like any other high quality USGA conforming golf ball.</p>

<p>Testicular cancer is the leading form of cancer in men ages 15 to 39, yet it has a 90% success rate when it is detected early. Sadly, testicular cancer has been considered a socially taboo subject for too long and awareness of the disease has been governed by social morays. Just as breast cancer has “Save the TaTas'”, we believe testicular cancer needs a catchy and long lasting slogan like “Slap Your Monkey” in communicating that testicular cancer is a monkey on the back of all affected men. We think this business has tremendous potential to make a difference in building awareness and contributing real money to the fight against this disease. Our plan is:</p>
<h4>►Donate 10% of our profits from all golf ball business to verified 501c3’s fighting testicular cancer<br/><span>►Placement of the violet ribbon testicular cancer on our golf balls and packaging to build awareness<br/><span>►Contributions of our product to golf tournaments hosted by verified 501c3s fighting testicular cancer<br/><span>►A Smartphone App that Combines Golf with Donations for Testicular Cancer<br/><span>►Online Promotion of Testicular Cancer and Charities Fighting Against it on Our Website</span></span></span></span>
</h4>
<p>Here are a few of the 501(c)3’s fighting cancer that we plan on researching to ensure financial due diligence. Our plan is that once research is complete, charities get “on our list” for eligible selection by our community for charitable donations.  Our community will be able to contribute charities for our review to go on “the list”.</p>

<p>A few of the things we would look at in an eligible charity would be overhead vs. giving, transparency in accounting practices (use of external audits), longevity, and management team. This is obviously a significant work item for us and will cost time and money.</p>

<p>We’re at a point now where we are ready to get funding. We have a marketing plan, a digital strategy that includes consumer engagement and a brand experience. We’ve completed the market research and understand the distribution channels we want to pursue. Also, we’ve done some things to protect the brand like trademarking and we set up a corporation called MonkeyBall™ Sports registered in Alabama as a DBA. Most importantly we know what our prospective customer looks like and the costs to get into the market that we need to fund. They include:</p>
<h4>
</h4>
<h4>►Costs to prototype and test our product before our 1st run<br/><span>►Costs for purchase order on 1st run and shipping cost (from and to), and warehousing<br/><span>►Ongoing technology costs, product development &amp; testing costs<br/><span>►Backoffice and Legal Costs to include Non-Profit Research<br/><span>►Digital strategy / medium costs &amp; software costs</span></span></span></span>
</h4>
<span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span>
<p></p>
<p>Also, we believe we need to do face to face marketing at various amateur and professional golf events and would like to invest in a ""booth"" including a golf simulator so we can pass out free balls to prospective customers and ask them to come over and try ""Slapping their Monkey"" while following up on the spot case sales. We believe a marketing approach similar to the ""Hooters Restaurant""  model will make the biggest splash with ladies passing out the free balls. We will display Testicular Cancer posters and information on Testicular Cancer (TC) Prevention as well as charities involved in the fight against this cancer and our hope is to be invited to TC Golf Tourneys.</p>

What if you could have your brand character and signature on thousands of golf balls produced and paid for by somebody else?

MonkeyBall™ Sports is a serious golf ball business startup with a vision to be the 1st golf ball company that crowd manages its brand character and charitable donations- while promoting fun, golf, and the pursuit of goodness.
By contributing to our launch at the $1, $35 or even $15,000 level, you are building a new business, but more so, a new way of managing a business that you can participate in once you have made a contribution. How will you participate? Our community forum at MonkeyBallSports.com is set up so that you can vote on and send in your own ideas, drawings, sketches etc on what you think our brand character should be. Simply go to our website and click on ""Monkey Around"".
And the pursuit of Goodness is specifically, fighting cancer under your direction by donating 10% of our golf ball profits to legitimate cancer charities you choose. While of course, making a profit and working to make a difference for men with testicular cancer, the most common cancer in men aged 15-35. 
 Our goal is to help you

“SLAP YOUR MONKEYBALL™!!!”
Get it? This is about more than golf. We want to create a profitable, fun business by selling golf balls, while engaging our community to raise money to help slap the testicular cancer monkey.

Get Our Balls, Get Involved…and a Few Laughs



The Hilarious MonkeyBall™ Ad That Is Going Viral!





And Will Make a Difference In the Fight Against Testicular Cancer



 How Did We Get Here

   
We've got what we think is a good idea - launch MonkeyBall™ Sports via crowdfunding AND be the 1st golf ball company that crowd manages its brand character and charitable donations - while promoting fun, golf, and the pursuit of goodness (see above!). Simply put, this is a business that combines
►Sales of Golf Products  (Phase 1) & Other Sports Products►A Brand Character Managed by Our Consumers►A Lot of Fun & A Lot of Good Humor►Helping You Fight Cancer While Having Fun!
To start our story, the fun began on the golf course when I was having an awful game, losing balls left and right until my bag was empty. When it was my turn to tee off on the 15th hole it was obvious to friends I had no more balls. A witty friend was quick to respond, tossed me a ball and told me “Why don’t you slap this monkey, that’s about all your good at.” And the branding idea for a golf ball was born. A golf ball called “MonkeyBall™” and a catchy phrase “Slap Your Monkey™”
MonkeyBall Sports captures the spirit of playing golf with friends - friends that you can cut up with and enjoy the times you have when you can let loose on the course and have a few laughs. It's about enjoying that same experience in a larger online community that contributes to choosing and experiencing our brand while enjoying a social media experience with people that love golf, a good sense of humor, and helping others.
Why We Feel So Strongly About Doing This Every hour on the hour, a man is diagnosed with testicular cancer which is the leading form of cancer in men ages 15-35 but can hit at any age. Yet testicular cancer awareness and education is lacking in our society when ironically early detection leads to survivability in 95% of cases. And testicular cancer is a monkey on the back of every man that suffers with it. That is why we believe ""Slap Your Monkey""™ can take on a whole new meaning in the cancer community (who would'a thought ""Save the Tatas???) .
We want to make a difference by donating 10% of the profits for each MonkeyBall® golf ball sale to non-profits working to end testicular cancer. We think we can start with golf balls and branch out into tennis balls, basketballs, t-shirts, koozies etc, as we grow and succeed.


 The Fun Part of the Story
Yes I trademarked both MonkeyBall™ and “Slap Your Monkey™”. I am proud to have my name go down in history as the person who trademarked “Slap Your Monkey™” for all things balls. But it was fun, and it got A LOT of laughs. We played around with the idea for what must have been a couple of years, until finally I ran into my friend, Hunter Cressall, who loved the idea and cut this video for me for free to bring the fun to life and encouraged me to donate to a humanitarian cause along the way.




Hunter Cressall, Co-Founder
Hopefully you are chuckling by now and engaged in what we are about to share regarding the business. It’s a lot less humorous, but I think you will find it intriguing and quite ballsy.

 The Business Side of the Story
When I got serious about brand marketing a golf ball called “MonkeyBall™, I decided I had to stop asking friends about the idea as friends tend to tell you what you want to hear. So I ventured out to a few golf stores in Birmingham Alabama where I live (I'm a Georgia transplant) and see if I could get a rise out of anyone with the catchy phrase “Slap Your Monkey™”. I decided Dick’s Sporting Goods might be a good place to start to conduct some ad-hoc questionnaires about the brand. A few minutes at Dick’s and I blew over to another sporting goods store, and again and again until I was sure I had cracked this nut. It turns out that all the guys I approached (I was too chicken to ask any ladies) loved the idea and consistently asked me where they could get a case of MonkeyBalls™”.

It wasn’t much longer after that I spent a couple of hundred bucks to test the water and conducted a survey with survata.com . The results were phenomenal – basically 60% of all polled indicated they felt strongly they would buy the ball, they believed others would buy the ball, and they even believed others would buy the ball for a friend!
So we cut this video to explain it (warning – a bit more serious than the one above!):


Scot Hanley, Co-Founder
and yes - donations are part of our business!

 We’re Not Monkeying Around 
We think this startup has huge potential. We want to start with golf balls and golf products t(hats, tees, shirts etc.) with an initial laser like focus on golf balls as we believe this is the most promising market segment in terms of demand, acceptance of the brand, prospective profit margins, and ease of entry. Why do we believe this?
►Golfers love a good joke on the course, there is demand (see survey results below)►Our survey results show huge promise with a 4% margin of error►Risk of market entry is low – this is a tested and huge market►Manufacturing and Distribution Channels are readily available►Startup Costs are Low and our crowdfunding campaign is realistic



Check Out Our Survey Results ▶︎


 Our MonkeyBall™ Product
Our plan is to roll out USGA Conforming  two core golf balls in phase 1 and assuming success, roll out three core USGA Conforming golf balls in phase 2. All MonkeyBall™ golf balls will be emblazoned with our logo “Slap Your Monkey™” and a corresponding mascot (or character) to attend the logo based on your input in our community. We will seek input from our supporters and community on the design of our character each business quarter to engage consumers in our digital strategy (see digital strategy below) and believe we will be the 1st golf ball company to do so.
Standard Two Core USGA Conforming Ball




Standard Three Core USGA Conforming Ball

All manufacturing will be done by a trusted third party while quality, marketing, distribution, and back office operations will be conducted in house, by our company MonkeyBall™ Sports. We believe quality control to be imperative in our operations and will dedicate capital to compression testing, core testing, dimple adherence, and quality of printed logos. The end result is we want a high quality ball that will go the distance and perform like any other high quality USGA conforming golf ball.

 Our Digital Marketing Strategy

We think the key to our success is consumer engagement combined with our brand in way that draws in customers and engages them in our online community. And we would like to be the 1st golf ball company to market golf balls with logos picked by our consumer online community. Think of it as a place where people have fun submitting their ideas for our character logo which are in turn voted on by the community. The MonkeyBall™ Community member who receives the most community support (votes) gets their MonkeyBall™ character and signature on thousands of our golf balls for one quarter! 
Additionally, they will receive several cases of their winning golf ball version to share as they see fit. For this launch phase & beyond, our plan is to create an online community where our customers are asked to participate in a fun and zany contest where they submit ideas for our quarterly rendition of our monkey mascot that will go on the golf ball with our logo. Players will even submit rough sketches of their logo with their idea (if they like). The community will vote on the ideas for mascots and the winner who gets the most votes wins the following:


►Their rendition of our monkey mascot on our ball for one business quarter►A signed case of MonkeyBall™ Golf Balls by our founder, and additional cases to share►Choice of Testicular Cancer non-profit for 10% of profit donation from us for one quarter►Personalized (phone, email etc.) updates from the founder 



In subsequent phases, we have digital marketing plan that includes the following contests & technology:
►An Online Novel About Our Mascot that is Completed in Phases by Our Community►An Online Naming Contest for the Name of Our Mascot►A Smartphone App that (Phase 1) that Combines Golf with Donations for Testicular Cancer►Smartphone App (future phases) for Golf that Provides Real Updates for all types of Charitable Golf Tournaments and other functionality that contributes to the success of the Tourney►Public Online Posts of Our Audited Financials (3rd Party) Since We Are Donating to Charities





 The Charitable Part of the Story
Testicular cancer is the leading form of cancer in men ages 15 to 39, yet it has a 90% success rate when it is detected early. Sadly, testicular cancer has been considered a socially taboo subject for too long and awareness of the disease has been governed by social morays. Just as breast cancer has “Save the TaTas'”, we believe testicular cancer needs a catchy and long lasting slogan like “Slap Your Monkey” in communicating that testicular cancer is a monkey on the back of all affected men. We think this business has tremendous potential to make a difference in building awareness and contributing real money to the fight against this disease. Our plan is:
►Donate 10% of our profits from all golf ball business to verified 501c3’s fighting testicular cancer►Placement of the violet ribbon testicular cancer on our golf balls and packaging to build awareness►Contributions of our product to golf tournaments hosted by verified 501c3s fighting testicular cancer►A Smartphone App that Combines Golf with Donations for Testicular Cancer►Online Promotion of Testicular Cancer and Charities Fighting Against it on Our Website

Here are a few of the 501(c)3’s fighting cancer that we plan on researching to ensure financial due diligence. Our plan is that once research is complete, charities get “on our list” for eligible selection by our community for charitable donations.  Our community will be able to contribute charities for our review to go on “the list”.


A few of the things we would look at in an eligible charity would be overhead vs. giving, transparency in accounting practices (use of external audits), longevity, and management team. This is obviously a significant work item for us and will cost time and money.

 What We Need To Do
We’re at a point now where we are ready to get funding. We have a marketing plan, a digital strategy that includes consumer engagement and a brand experience. We’ve completed the market research and understand the distribution channels we want to pursue. Also, we’ve done some things to protect the brand like trademarking and we set up a corporation called MonkeyBall™ Sports registered in Alabama as a DBA. Most importantly we know what our prospective customer looks like and the costs to get into the market that we need to fund. They include:


►Costs to prototype and test our product before our 1st run►Costs for purchase order on 1st run and shipping cost (from and to), and warehousing►Ongoing technology costs, product development & testing costs►Backoffice and Legal Costs to include Non-Profit Research►Digital strategy / medium costs & software costs



Also, we believe we need to do face to face marketing at various amateur and professional golf events and would like to invest in a ""booth"" including a golf simulator so we can pass out free balls to prospective customers and ask them to come over and try ""Slapping their Monkey"" while following up on the spot case sales. We believe a marketing approach similar to the ""Hooters Restaurant""  model will make the biggest splash with ladies passing out the free balls. We will display Testicular Cancer posters and information on Testicular Cancer (TC) Prevention as well as charities involved in the fight against this cancer and our hope is to be invited to TC Golf Tourneys.
Our timeline reflected below includes a work breakdown structure for our use.

</div><h3><br/></h3></div>","We are the ownership group who recently purchased the rights for the world famous Pillow Fight League that ceased operation in 2011.  We are looking for your help to bring the PFL back - and be  bigger, better, and more bad ass than ever.  This time, we are bringing the PFL's rabid fans into the fold by giving them the chance to support the League from the ground up, as we resurrect the world renowned Pillow Fight League with a fierce new roster of fighters.The PFL's Origin StoryThe PFL ran from 2006 through 2011 hosting 66 events throughout North America. Because of the league's unique offering of professional women's pillow fights,  the PFL was able to capture media attention from all over the world including Fox, ESPN, Good Morning America, Inside Edition, ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, MTV, VH1, Sports Illustrated, Reader's Digest, The New York Times, Washington Post, Boston Herald, National Enquirer Maxim and many others.  Check out this rave review of the PFL from ESPN.com in 2010.
Make no mistake, this has always been a sport. This isn't an entertainment entity with a predetermined outcome, as you might find in professional wrestling. Our fighters are real fighters, not spokesmodels. We match up dedicated athletes, each vying to become the best Pillow Fighter in the world. 


What it takes to stage a professional Pillow Fight
There are substantial costs to the start-up, running and daily operations of a professional sports league. To ensure that all athletes and support staff are compensated fairly and able to provide a world class production, we ask for your support.
Funds will be allocated in the following categories: 


Procuring original rights
Athlete compensation and bonus
In-venue production
Set and Combat Structure
Insurance
Advertising and promotion
Training
Video / web production
Production staff
Perk Fulfilment


Now is the time to bring back the PFLOur ownership purchased the rights for the PFL over 6 months ago and have been working steadily since then to launch this campaign.For the last 6 months we have been talking with some of the original fighters and fans as well as potential future PFL stars and they all say the same thing - WE WANT THE PFL BACK!  Everyone is incredibly excited about the possible return of the PFL - not only because Pillow Fighting is awesome (it is) but because we feel that in 2015 it is time for a Women's only professional sports league.  Women have made great strides recently in spectator sports and the PFL is just one more reason that watching women compete is awesome.  So please help us bring back the greatest combat sport in history and let us do what we love - PILLOW FIGHT!

I thought long and hard about this problem, and how the virus spreads primarily in an airborne manner, and I’ve managed to design some brand new, totally unknown and novel technologies to defeat Covid-19. These are still at the concept stage. Please understand this, the concepts we’re currently working on have proved to be 100% effective in halting and arresting the spread of all variants of Covid-19 through our preliminary mock up tests. These concepts are based on the use of proven and existing techniques and technologies, but are utilized or employed in a much more function appropriate manner. They have proven highly effective in this new and novel format.<br/><br/>They provide close to 100% protection against airborne transmission from the Covid-19 virus for school children attending classes, patrons frequenting various types of businesses, including restaurants, bars, hairdressers, beauty salons, dermatologists, dental offices and general offices. The CDC has established that the primary method of Covid-19 transmission is primarily through accumulation of airborne particles.<br/><br/> We’re now looking to further develop these products through prototypes culminating with a final design. We’re also looking to patent these designs as the concept has already been proven This is what you are supporting. This is wholly where the funds raised through this campaign will be used.</p><p>I’m currently at the point where I need to establish patents on these products in order to roll them out. I’m going to need to employ a prototyping firm for my prototypes and a Patent Attorney/Firm to write my patents quickly. This is where I need financial help to pay the prototyping firm and the Attorneys.</p><p>The prototypes and patents are going to cost $250K. The patents will be filed with USPTO (United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office).<br/><br/>Naturally, I don’t need to stress the urgency of meeting this goal expeditiously, as we all understand that the sooner, we can reach full deployment of these technologies, the more lives we can save and bring an early end to this deadly scourge.<br/><br/>I believe it’s a highly worthwhile endeavor if we can help the school kids and save the struggling businesses.<br/><br/>The funds raised will cover the costs of the prototyping and the patents (the essential next step). I’m hoping to expedite these next two stages.<br/><br/>Your support is crucial in ensuring that products get out expeditiously to have an immediate and profound impact in the lives of millions of people. <br/><br/>Thank you in advance for your generosity and support. I appreciate all your help. Your donations will help me get closer to reaching my goal. I can’t do this without you.</p><p>It’s ok if you don’t have the finances available to help us or donate, we understand that. We would also ask for your prayers, as we understand, that prayer is very powerful and lead to miracles. So, therefore, we can still all come together and be a participant in making this happen with whatever we are able to donate.</p><p>Prayers and funding are both welcome. We thank you in advance for your participation and help as we can’t do this alone.</p><p>Thank you and please share the link.</p><p>Please share this with everyone you know.<br/><br/> <br/><u>TO ELABORATE:</u><br/><br/>These Products Will:<br/><br/>·       Enable children to go back to school safely and full-time.<br/><br/>·       Free up parents to go back to work and move our economy along.<br/><br/>·       Enable businesses to stay open.<br/><br/>·       Keep variants suppressed.<br/><br/>·       Will safely allow indoor dining.<br/><br/>·       Allow personal grooming services to be done safely.<br/><br/>·       Allow a degree of normality in society.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620159650/kb4xpjr6h5agi0ie1fuf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> I can’t really talk too much detail about the internal working of these conceptual products for obvious reasons, but I am able to share some concept drawings and have provided them for more transparency.<br/> </p><p> I’m hoping to release the school products into the schools asap, as the new school year starts August 9th.</p><p>I will need to do final designs, manufacturing and production which will all be done in the USA (keeping money and creating new jobs here).<br/><br/>Please help me in this endeavor. We need to protect our children, their future, their emotional and mental well-being.<br/><br/>The sooner we can get these products up and running and out into the communities, the more lives we can save, and the sooner we can bring an end to this pandemic.<br/><br/>Let’s make a difference together in this Covid-19 war.<br/><br/><u>What I was Engaged in Before the Pandemic Hit</u>:<br/><br/>A primary product I had prototyped, completed and tested was Toothsaver. This product is a non-invasive, tooth infection zapping technology that is 100% effective in completely eliminating the bacterial infection, whilst avoiding the use of antibiotics. So that we are able to keep the full antibiotics efficacy for future generations and avoid the birth of new superbugs. Overuse of antibiotics has led to resistant strains of bacteria known as superbugs. The CDC and WHO have warned of this over prescribing trend.<br/><br/>Shockingly, even today, people in rural parts of third world countries still die from tooth infections as septicemia sets in. However, I digress, we currently have bigger problems that we’re going to need to solve first, namely, the current pandemic.<br/><br/>It is highly unfortunate that when it was time to patent and produce the Toothsaver product en masse, Covid-19 hit and changed everything.<br/><br/><u> MORE INFORMATION:</u><br/><br/>I believe that the correct technologies deployed strategically can make a world of difference to the spread of the infection rate. We do still have the global threat from variants, and it is of course, totally unknown as to which variant may escape the control of our vaccines and cause another surge.<br/><br/>Yes, we are all deeply impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and yes, it’s a very difficult problem to solve overnight. This isn’t a battle for one man, or one president, but needs to be not only a community effort, but indeed, a global effort.  It has to be a long-term sustained effort that requires engagement with the enemy on many fronts. I was quite surprised to find that there are technologies available to us, that we haven’t currently engaged. It is clear that they can make a huge difference in the battle and reduce the infection and death rates significantly once we have deployed this equipment en masse.<br/><br/>Yes, some states are doing quite well with Covid-19 case numbers, whilst others are seeing a surge once again. Some states are wearing masks, whilst some have dropped masks completely. I fully expect that we will quickly reach a point where all states drop the mandatory mask wearing orders.<br/><br/>The key is to get these products into restaurants, schools and businesses in a timely and expeditious manner. Such that even if we get to a point where mask wearing is completely dropped and no longer mandatory, schools, dining indoors and our service businesses are still kept safe from the invasion of variants through the use of these strategically placed technologies.<br/><br/>This equipment will continue to protect against the threat of variants, even after the mask mandates have been lifted, and we begin to enjoy the full freedom of normality. The equipment will act as a sentinel whilst offering full and unencumbered freedom.<br/><br/>It’s amazing how long simple tasks can take when you’re underfunded. I believe this effort and this program can quickly be taken to the next level of implementation with your help. So, I would sincerely urge you to join my effort and let’s make a difference to school children, the businesses, create jobs in the economy and preserve the mental health of our great nation.<br/><br/> Please help me get these technologies launched as I can’t do it alone.<br/><br/> 1.    The good news is that the preliminary mock up tests work 100% as expected.<br/><br/>2.    I need to get complete the prototype and get the patents in place.<br/><br/>3.    I may need to do final development.<br/><br/>4.    I may need help setting up a production facility.<br/><br/>5.    I may need to establish contracts with school districts and businesses around the country.<br/><br/> </p><p><u>GOALS</u><br/><br/><u>Immediate Goal</u>:<br/><br/>·       Get prototypes and patents secured.<br/><br/><u>Short Term Goals</u>:<br/><br/>·       Liaise with and establish contracts with manufacturing and production facilities.<br/><br/>·       Establish distribution channels of Covid-19 products to US school districts and to beneficiary US businesses.<br/><br/><u>Long Term Goals</u>:<br/><br/>·       Donate products to impoverished countries that can’t afford the equipment.<br/><br/>Please help me, and know that your donations and help will have a profound impact on the future generations, our economy and our country. It’s ok if you don’t have the finances available to help us or donate, we understand that. We would also ask for your prayers, as we understand, that prayer is very powerful and lead to miracles.

We thank you in advance for your participation and help as we can’t do this alone.</p><p>Thank you and please share the link.</p><p>God Bless You and God Bless America.<br/><br/>Please share this as this needs to be expedited.<br/><br/> <br/><u>BACKGROUND:</u><br/><br/>I spent my early life and adulthood getting my education in the U.K. I’ve worked for numerous companies over the time period, but started to develop my own products independently in 2019. I did have some products in the pipeline in 2019 but was unable to see a successful launch as the pandemic hit and disrupted everything.<br/><br/>That’s when I started to focus on and develop these current Covid-19 products.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.entertastic.com/images/library/_esenzor.com/gifs/fire-alarm.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Senzor can detect fire, water, noise, vibration, movement and light. So you can apply a Senzor on each door and window in your home so you can receive alerts if someone tries to enter or breaks a window or something else happens, like for example a fire.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Senzors are small, self-powered devices that contain an advanced integrated circuit that detects movement, vibration, sound, fire, water, light.</p>
<p>Whenever a Senzor is triggered by any event, it will send a notification to your smartphone through bridges, other nearby Senzors, or other nearby smartphones.</p>
<p>When not in your direct Bluetooth range (which is about 500 feet/150 meters), the Senzor can be located using our mesh and crowd GPS network with accuracy down to about 50 meters, from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>When within range you can find it using our new, patent-pending 3D tracking technology that shows you its exact position relative to yours.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>How is it powered?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Senzor is the first device of its kind not to use any batteries, wires or recharging. It is the dawn of a new age of self-powered devices that harvest their energy from the environment. It is also the first device of its kind in the world to use super capacitors for energy storage. </p>
<p>Thanks to 2 years of research and hard work, we were able to design a super capacitor that has twice the capacity of similar sized products and the ability to withstand about 10 million charge/discharge cycles.</p>
<p>This new amazing technology is currently generating multiple patents and will likely find thousands of other applications by the end of the decade.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Technical details</h3>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467151176/technical-details2_ctwuwm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Senzor is built on top of a custom module we have designed around a Cortex M0 microcontroller, an energy harvesting IC, a suite of sensors and on-board Bluetooth and antenna. It also contains a super capacitor that can store up to 30 Farads in real life conditions, and delivers outstanding performance for up to 10 million cycles - that's over 1000 years of continuous functioning. The entire circuit is assembled on an ultra-thin flexible board that allows the Senzor to bend to a certain degree and also makes it up to 5 millimeters thinner than any other similar device currently on the market. <br/><p></p>
<p>Our design is solid, tested and currently pending multiple patents within the USA, the EU and several Asian countries.</p>
<p>The Senzor is cast into a special polymer resin that ensures the Senzor stays waterproof, does not crack or break when dropped, bent, sat on, and also provides excellent heat and vibration conductivity so the energy harvesting component works under almost any conditions. Forget sandblasted aluminum and plastic, Senzors are more durable and also look and feel much, much better.</p>
<p>The Senzor has no moving parts or connectors. All its features are gesture-controlled - taps or shakes. There are no buttons that break in time, or openings that would allow for water and dust to get inside.</p>
<p>We are able to provide Senzors in 6 base colors (black, white, blue, green, yellow, orange) and 24 different combinations of colors and gloss levels. </p>
<p>We even designed a custom, unique perfume to give Senzors a very nice scent, more information about this particular feature will be available very soon through our website. Let's call it a surprise for now.</p>
<p>Senzors connect to the internet through: </p>
<ul>
<li>other Senzors nearby that can relay communication (basically, a mesh network);</li>
<li>the Senzor app installed on any Bluetooth-enabled smartphone in range;</li>
<li>WiFi and 3G/4G bridges that we will provide to an increasing number of locations worldwide;</li>
<li>other open networks that provide open Bluetooth connectivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Senzor's radio chipset is currently pending FCC and CE certifications, we expect our paperwork to come out within the following 6 weeks, so there will be no delays.</p>
<p>Senzors connect through SSL-encrypted channels to our global cloud network that keeps track of each individual Senzor and its status and location in real time, and delivers instant notifications to the account owners or through APIs and any of the integrations below.</p>

You will also need a Bluetooth dongle and sample source code from our upcoming Github repo. Note that we do not offer replacement under warranty for bricked Senzors.<br/>

<p>At this time we have a functional prototype and all suppliers and manufacturers lined up. </p>
<p>On our end we would like to improve the UI design on the mobile apps so we can get them published before the first Senzors ship out.</p>
<p>Senzors will be ready and shipped to backers in December 2016.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Why is this on Indiegogo?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are a bootstrapped, self funded company operating since 2003 and we had success with our other products without ever looking for VC or crowdfunding. Senzor is a by-product and falls slightly outside of our core business area. Two years ago when we came up with the idea for Senzor we thought it can help a lot of people, however we are not in a position to further invest into this product at this time. If our crowdfunding campaign is successful the product will hit the market, otherwise it will end up in another box in our archive room.</span></p>
<p></p>
<br/>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With any project there may be some risks and challenges, however this is not the case with Senzor. It is an amazingly simple, fail-proof system that just can’t fail. At this point we have fully tested and functional prototypes, the entire cloud infrastructure set up, all apps and APIs, and we are about to apply some final UI improvements and start producing Senzors at scale.</p>
<p>Since we already have working relationships in place with component suppliers, manufacturing and assembly plants, packaging and shipping companies, we won’t be facing any difficulties getting the job done on time.</p>
<p><i>Please note</i>: because Senzors require heat and/or light and/or vibration in order to function, if you live in a state or country such as Alaska or Northern Norway or Finland where it's cold and dark for more than 3-4 months in a row each year, Senzor may not work properly for you, so please contact us before backing the project so we can confirm if you can use the product.</p>

This new amazing technology is currently generating multiple patents and will likely find thousands of other applications by the end of the decade.


Technical details

Senzor is built on top of a custom module we have designed around a Cortex M0 microcontroller, an energy harvesting IC, a suite of sensors and on-board Bluetooth and antenna. It also contains a super capacitor that can store up to 30 Farads in real life conditions, and delivers outstanding performance for up to 10 million cycles - that's over 1000 years of continuous functioning. The entire circuit is assembled on an ultra-thin flexible board that allows the Senzor to bend to a certain degree and also makes it up to 5 millimeters thinner than any other similar device currently on the market. 
Our design is solid, tested and currently pending multiple patents within the USA, the EU and several Asian countries.
The Senzor is cast into a special polymer resin that ensures the Senzor stays waterproof, does not crack or break when dropped, bent, sat on, and also provides excellent heat and vibration conductivity so the energy harvesting component works under almost any conditions. Forget sandblasted aluminum and plastic, Senzors are more durable and also look and feel much, much better.
The Senzor has no moving parts or connectors. All its features are gesture-controlled - taps or shakes. There are no buttons that break in time, or openings that would allow for water and dust to get inside.
We are able to provide Senzors in 6 base colors (black, white, blue, green, yellow, orange) and 24 different combinations of colors and gloss levels. 
We even designed a custom, unique perfume to give Senzors a very nice scent, more information about this particular feature will be available very soon through our website. Let's call it a surprise for now.
Senzors connect to the internet through: 

other Senzors nearby that can relay communication (basically, a mesh network);
the Senzor app installed on any Bluetooth-enabled smartphone in range;
WiFi and 3G/4G bridges that we will provide to an increasing number of locations worldwide;
other open networks that provide open Bluetooth connectivity.

Senzor's radio chipset is currently pending FCC and CE certifications, we expect our paperwork to come out within the following 6 weeks, so there will be no delays.
Senzors connect through SSL-encrypted channels to our global cloud network that keeps track of each individual Senzor and its status and location in real time, and delivers instant notifications to the account owners or through APIs and any of the integrations below.
Senzor integrates with...


API and SDK available for...

 If required by a specific application, Senzors can be re-programmed through the Arduino IDE and over-the-air programming. You will also need a Bluetooth dongle and sample source code from our upcoming Github repo. Note that we do not offer replacement under warranty for bricked Senzors.

Timeline
At this time we have a functional prototype and all suppliers and manufacturers lined up. 
On our end we would like to improve the UI design on the mobile apps so we can get them published before the first Senzors ship out.
Senzors will be ready and shipped to backers in December 2016.

Use of funds


finalize packaging (promise: no plastic clamshells);
build a first batch of as many Senzors as possible;
build and deploy as many Wifi/3G bridges to as many locations as possible;
improve UI design for the free apps (iOs and Android);
publish 3rd party integrations and code samples.





Why is this on Indiegogo?
We are a bootstrapped, self funded company operating since 2003 and we had success with our other products without ever looking for VC or crowdfunding. Senzor is a by-product and falls slightly outside of our core business area. Two years ago when we came up with the idea for Senzor we thought it can help a lot of people, however we are not in a position to further invest into this product at this time. If our crowdfunding campaign is successful the product will hit the market, otherwise it will end up in another box in our archive room.


Risks & Challenges
With any project there may be some risks and challenges, however this is not the case with Senzor. It is an amazingly simple, fail-proof system that just can’t fail. At this point we have fully tested and functional prototypes, the entire cloud infrastructure set up, all apps and APIs, and we are about to apply some final UI improvements and start producing Senzors at scale.
Since we already have working relationships in place with component suppliers, manufacturing and assembly plants, packaging and shipping companies, we won’t be facing any difficulties getting the job done on time.
Please note: because Senzors require heat and/or light and/or vibration in order to function, if you live in a state or country such as Alaska or Northern Norway or Finland where it's cold and dark for more than 3-4 months in a row each year, Senzor may not work properly for you, so please contact us before backing the project so we can confirm if you can use the product.

<p>ChiaraMail is based on Envelope-Content Splitting, or ECS, a technology that can provide a highly-effective defense against both e-mail
spying and phishing attacks. ECS works by removing, or splitting off, the message
content from the mail headers and sending the content, via a secure link, to a
content server. Thus, since the content is no longer part of the message, your
mail service provider's servers do not have access to your content and end-to-end
encryption becomes unnecessary. Furthermore, by using an innovative
authentication process, would-be spoofers are stopped in their tracks, unable
to deliver the mail content or files they need for a successful phishing
attack. </p>

<h2>ULTRO: The Ultimate Edge in Gaming and Sports</h2>
<p>Gamers and those who participate in high-speed sports are always looking for an edge. Gamers upgrade internet connections, processors, RAM, graphic cards; sports enthusiasts change their shoes, clothing, rackets or clubs... even if the advantages over your opponent are minimal. While we can tweak and re-tweak, <strong>ULTRO</strong> edges your most critical component: <strong>your brain</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>ULTRO </strong>uses proprietary sound technology to accelerate your brain’s internal clock. By giving your brain a brief burst of speed, <strong>ULTRO</strong> can increase your reaction times by up to 10%. With <strong>ULTRO</strong>, you perceive your opponent in slower motion, giving you more time to predict their reactions.</p>
<p>The <strong>ULTRO</strong> effect is well documented. Professional competitors of high-speed racquet sports report the same comparable effect you can achieve with <strong>ULTRO</strong>, that of being ""in the zone."" Similarly, <strong>ULTRO</strong> produces what the military commonly calls ""bullet-time"", where soldiers involved in firefights report that time seems to slow down.</p>
<p><strong>The result?</strong> <strong>ULTRO</strong> delivers faster reactions in gameplay, allowing you to better predict your opponent's moves.</p>
<h2>The science behind ULTRO</h2>
<p><strong>ULTRO</strong> is based on the successful application of scalar timing, or scalar expectancy theory (SET), the concept that humans possess an arousal-sensitive internal clock used to perform timing tasks. Exposing the brain to repetitive stimulation, particularly in the form of periodic sounds, will almost always increase the subjective duration of any stimulation it precedes or accompanies. <i>Phew!</i></p>

<p>My name is Jeff Savitz &amp; I am an Ivy League trained professor of research. <strong>I fought the fat gene all my life</strong> both physically &amp; psychologically &amp; finally won after I developed the program that I am sharing with you. It all started when I was 6 years old &amp; over the years my weight rose &amp; fell reaching a <strong>maximum of 290 lbs.</strong> </p>
<p>None of the weight loss programs I have tried worked because they presume that overweight &amp; obese people can eat in moderation. Wrong! This program enables users to <strong>look up the lbs</strong> associated with whatever they eat (with a database of nearly 100,000 foods and beverages) &amp; drop a handful to achieve their goals for the long haul.  For example, <strong>one 20 oz soda daily means 27 lbs a year, 4 oz of steak/day is 32 lbs/year, &amp; 2 slices of pepperoni pizza/day is 64 lbs/year!</strong> In addition the program features <strong>a training video every week for the first year.</strong> A certified trainer trains me &amp; <strong>I pledge to lose 24 more lbs in the first year. Additionally, I will act as people's role model &amp; coach so they can meet their goals too.</strong> No overweight person really likes to do exercise so I’ve made the videos fun.  In fact, <strong>I dance at the end of each video!!!</strong> I hope to <strong>make America healthy starting with you &amp; your family and friends</strong> if you need it!</p>
<p>I would like to raise $250,000 to further develop the app, hire &amp; train the right people for the company, produce top grade exercise videos &amp; promote the app on social media with a significant advertising budget. </p>
<p>The <strong>retail price for the app is going to be $20 for the year.</strong> I would like to offer <strong>donors a year subscription for $15.</strong> For any contributions made above that, <strong>half of the money will be donated to organizations dedicated to conquering diabetes.</strong> For example, if you donate $35, $10 will go to conquer diabetes. For anyone who donates $5 or more but less than $15, we will acknowledge their name for helping develop the app. The app is free for limited use to all people. Currently it enables window shoppers the option for 10 free food &amp; activity lookups &amp; one training video. </p>
<p><strong>The program is a means for which Americans can finally get healthy once &amp; for all.</strong></p>
<p>You can help us by keeping up-to-date with us on social media &amp; helping us share our campaign! <strong>Follow me, the founder, on Twitter (@ProfessorSavitz), Y-I-M-FAT on Instagram (yimfat) and Y-I-M-FAT on Facebook. </strong></p>
<p>Whether you can contribute or not please <strong>share this app with your friends &amp; family</strong> &amp; help them to live a healthier &amp; longer life.</p>
<p>Remember the initial use is free!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

My name is Jeff Savitz & I am an Ivy League trained professor of research. I fought the fat gene all my life both physically & psychologically & finally won after I developed the program that I am sharing with you. It all started when I was 6 years old & over the years my weight rose & fell reaching a maximum of 290 lbs. 
None of the weight loss programs I have tried worked because they presume that overweight & obese people can eat in moderation. Wrong! This program enables users to look up the lbs associated with whatever they eat (with a database of nearly 100,000 foods and beverages) & drop a handful to achieve their goals for the long haul.  For example, one 20 oz soda daily means 27 lbs a year, 4 oz of steak/day is 32 lbs/year, & 2 slices of pepperoni pizza/day is 64 lbs/year! In addition the program features a training video every week for the first year. A certified trainer trains me & I pledge to lose 24 more lbs in the first year. Additionally, I will act as people's role model & coach so they can meet their goals too. No overweight person really likes to do exercise so I’ve made the videos fun.  In fact, I dance at the end of each video!!! I hope to make America healthy starting with you & your family and friends if you need it!
I would like to raise $250,000 to further develop the app, hire & train the right people for the company, produce top grade exercise videos & promote the app on social media with a significant advertising budget. 
The retail price for the app is going to be $20 for the year. I would like to offer donors a year subscription for $15. For any contributions made above that, half of the money will be donated to organizations dedicated to conquering diabetes. For example, if you donate $35, $10 will go to conquer diabetes. For anyone who donates $5 or more but less than $15, we will acknowledge their name for helping develop the app. The app is free for limited use to all people. Currently it enables window shoppers the option for 10 free food & activity lookups & one training video. 
The program is a means for which Americans can finally get healthy once & for all.
You can help us by keeping up-to-date with us on social media & helping us share our campaign! Follow me, the founder, on Twitter (@ProfessorSavitz), Y-I-M-FAT on Instagram (yimfat) and Y-I-M-FAT on Facebook. 
Whether you can contribute or not please share this app with your friends & family & help them to live a healthier & longer life.
Remember the initial use is free!
Sincerely,
Jeff",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is Goldkind.Pro?</h3>
<p>Goldkind.Pro is the simplest solution to protect a baby or infant against pulse-modulated radiation. There is no cheaper alternative to achieve this protection. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520851343/ainkk7iwob0hzm6atcwi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Goldkind.pro comes in two different versions, as a complete crib with integrated radiation protection or as retrofitting radiation protection canopy.</p>
<p>Goldkind.Pro is a complete solution which makes it possible to reduce the radiation by up to 99.999%, which is emitted day and night by more and more Wi-Fi capable devices, cordless telephones, mobile phones, etc. Goldkind.Pro fabric provides an attenuation of the electromagnetic radiation of up to 55 dB.</p>
<p>In combination with the Goldkind.Pro radiation protection underlay, which also reliably eliminates high frequency electromagnetic radiation from below, your child will have a very comfortable, calming break from the influences of the technological world.</p>

<h3>What will be better with Goldkind.Pro?</h3>
<p>You need considerable specialised knowledge and highly complex technology (power circuit breakers, measuring devices, etc.) to shield yourself from high frequency electromagnetic radiation, which all in all is very expensive. Goldkind.Pro is the best and easiest way to protect your child from high frequency electromagnetic radiation where it spends most of the day.</p>

<h3><u>QiziQ</u></h3>
<p><strong>The new QiziQ gym weights are MADE OUT OF METAL just like the traditional weights around the gyms of the world. </strong></p>
<p>QiziQ weights are then <strong>coated with a color resin</strong> to suit different customer tastes.</p>
<p>QiziQ weights <u><strong>are not plastic</strong></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498362194/lgezr1rquksheni2ji3m.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498362728/ni01nzxqbtfrsey4thza.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>QiziQ was born from a simple question: <strong><i>Current weights are a one size fits all, what if there were new gym weights that are easier to use and save space around the home while giving me the color and design that inspires me to work out more?.</i></strong>
</li>
<li>On that kitchen table, a year ago, an idea was born to create a nature inspired home workout system, which you will see in our journey to My QiziQ !</li>
<li>
<strong>QiziQ now needs your help to make it to the store shelves and online stores of the world</strong>. We want to engage the best manufacturer to bring a totally new product to the world. My son was battling with his weight and weighed 16 stone at the age of 12. He didn't want to leave home and join others at the local community centers and gyms. I was left with the option to find him a complete home workout which would provide him with the exercises he needed. My partner was also shy to be seen out there displaying a not so toned body and needed help with their confidence. QiziQ became the solution that would work in the home, or can be ordered with breakfast at a hotel and would be delivered on a trolley and could be something my son could take with him to college without baggage difficulty!</li>
<li>With your contribution I can now give QiziQ to the world.</li>
<li>I would like to give home based fitness to every home in the world by providing <strong>just 2 gym weights that transform into 4 gym weights</strong> for multiple workouts. Through the QiziQ system, one only needs to switch handles to get a full set of Gym weights that include the <strong>Barbell, The Dumbbell, The Cable Weight and the Kettle-bell.</strong> Its an incredible combination that saves all homes, money and space!</li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<ul>
<li>QiziQ wants to engage an identified manufacturer to create the various molds that will allow QiziQ to manufacture its unique click-and-connect handle as well as produce the customized versions to suit your choice of gym weights equipment. We want to save you money and space around the home and we will also let you in on the unique gym station that is hot on the heels of QiziQ. Watch this space for the QiziQ Trym but, right now, we need you help to bring QiziQ to market.</li>
<li>Never before has a brand new gym idea generated so much excitement as QiziQ has created . See our rewards page and make sure you look at the sneak preview of the QiziQ Trym. </li>
<li>In the unlikely event that we fail to hit our tooling and manufacturing target, QiziQ will invest in delivering the basic stock lines and may not be able to offer the customized versions like <strong><i>grandma's quilt.</i></strong> We will, however, invest anything we receive into creating a fresh campaign to deliver the full QiziQ experience including The Trym.</li>
<li>We are passionate about changing the entire sport and fitness industry and will not stop at the first hurdle. </li>

<h3>QiziQ Impact</h3>
<p>For more than a century, the gym weights have been daddy's domain because he was allowed out of the house after 6 p.m. Mum stayed at home and made the meals and understandably sampled most of them for taste and ensuring she had put enough love into her dinner creations, resulting in the unavoidable weight gain.</p>
<p>In ,modern times, it has become unsafe for the teenager to leave home while a game is on with their online ""friends"" The result has been some generous addition of girth around the waist ...But, the old weights belong to Daddy and the garage is basically a no-go area! </p>
<p>They are serious looking, black, grey menacing and intimidating..... until <strong>QiziQ!</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497776359/hbhioxgxnhpocfzbls7n.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>QiziQ came from a simple question. <strong>Can I and Will I</strong> work out better if I loved what was doing and if it didn't feel like a punishment or after-school detention?</li>
<li>The family that was around the dinner table that evening started a  journey which culminated in..QIZIQ.</li>
<li>A fully customizable gym weight system that will match any budget, suit your taste your fetishes, save you space and above all <strong>persuade you work with it!</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497776511/rgprjwke4shiunlji7pj.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>During the QiziQ journey we faced many hurdles but I am glad had the best product designers who believed in the product and came up with the most inspiring solutions to the concept. Their years of experience came in very useful combined with their invaluable links to global manufacturers. This gave me access to world quality expertise but off-course this does not remove the risks associated with the launch of any new product.</p>
<p>QiziQ is a total re-invention of the gym weights industry and it's capability to enter the home, the hotel, the school and all other domains makes it unique and therefore susceptible to various challenges.</p>
<p>QiziQ faces the unique challenge of not being able to deliver promises due to inadequate funding which will cause it to fail on certain molds while delivering on the standard version without any issues. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497776602/hlsce4om6rbojjh5wxqm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>BUT, with your support we know that these are purely transient hurdles and we will engage them head on to create the same mold that delivers all those brilliantly personalized QiziQ cradles and weights.</p>
<p>We are confident of our ability to fully customize our weights to those that request this service.</p>

<p><strong>It all began around the kitchen table and led to the production of our first visual. The question that was asked that night was: What if I could have gym weights that look exactly the way I want them to look based on a fruit that I like...would that encourage more people to work out around the home?</strong></p>
<p>Thus began the journey which has been carefully entered in our diary below:</p>
<p><u><strong>The QiziQ Diary</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Duku Design April 2016</strong></p>
<p>We engaged a top UK design company to transform our doodles and sketches into a commercial product.</p>
<p><strong>Progress May 2016 </strong></p>
<p>The QiziQ weights begin to take shape following our design inspiration from nature. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495360460/jyxxftcvsdjkvyo9jxlb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>June 2016 The new weights get a name !</b></p>
<p>The birth of the name QiziQ </p>
<p>After several days of brainstorming we landed on a name for the new gym weights</p>
<p><strong>QUISQUE </strong><strong>   - </strong><strong><i>Latin name for fitness, and for ease of pronunciation it became  QIZIQ</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Further thoughts during 2016</strong></u></p>
<p>This is a home kit and must be space saving. The video above gives a good indication of the workout routines that are achievable. We recognized that a fully-fledged gym would not be easy within a small flat or hotel room. QiziQ is our solution to a daily toning workout, to kick up a good sweat and repeat again. Its flexible handle allows the user to save space and increase portability of the whole set from room to room and even when going away from home, QiziQ can be easily taken with you.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","QiziQ
The new QiziQ gym weights are MADE OUT OF METAL just like the traditional weights around the gyms of the world. 
QiziQ weights are then coated with a color resin to suit different customer tastes.
QiziQ weights are not plastic


QiziQ was born from a simple question: Current weights are a one size fits all, what if there were new gym weights that are easier to use and save space around the home while giving me the color and design that inspires me to work out more?.

On that kitchen table, a year ago, an idea was born to create a nature inspired home workout system, which you will see in our journey to My QiziQ !

QiziQ now needs your help to make it to the store shelves and online stores of the world. We want to engage the best manufacturer to bring a totally new product to the world. My son was battling with his weight and weighed 16 stone at the age of 12. He didn't want to leave home and join others at the local community centers and gyms. I was left with the option to find him a complete home workout which would provide him with the exercises he needed. My partner was also shy to be seen out there displaying a not so toned body and needed help with their confidence. QiziQ became the solution that would work in the home, or can be ordered with breakfast at a hotel and would be delivered on a trolley and could be something my son could take with him to college without baggage difficulty!
With your contribution I can now give QiziQ to the world.
I would like to give home based fitness to every home in the world by providing just 2 gym weights that transform into 4 gym weights for multiple workouts. Through the QiziQ system, one only needs to switch handles to get a full set of Gym weights that include the Barbell, The Dumbbell, The Cable Weight and the Kettle-bell. Its an incredible combination that saves all homes, money and space!


I would like to engage a manufacturer and start delivering QiziQ to the world and I need you help to achieve this


 
What We Need & What You Get


QiziQ wants to engage an identified manufacturer to create the various molds that will allow QiziQ to manufacture its unique click-and-connect handle as well as produce the customized versions to suit your choice of gym weights equipment. We want to save you money and space around the home and we will also let you in on the unique gym station that is hot on the heels of QiziQ. Watch this space for the QiziQ Trym but, right now, we need you help to bring QiziQ to market.
Never before has a brand new gym idea generated so much excitement as QiziQ has created . See our rewards page and make sure you look at the sneak preview of the QiziQ Trym. 
In the unlikely event that we fail to hit our tooling and manufacturing target, QiziQ will invest in delivering the basic stock lines and may not be able to offer the customized versions like grandma's quilt. We will, however, invest anything we receive into creating a fresh campaign to deliver the full QiziQ experience including The Trym.
We are passionate about changing the entire sport and fitness industry and will not stop at the first hurdle. 



QiziQ Impact
For more than a century, the gym weights have been daddy's domain because he was allowed out of the house after 6 p.m. Mum stayed at home and made the meals and understandably sampled most of them for taste and ensuring she had put enough love into her dinner creations, resulting in the unavoidable weight gain.
In ,modern times, it has become unsafe for the teenager to leave home while a game is on with their online ""friends"" The result has been some generous addition of girth around the waist ...But, the old weights belong to Daddy and the garage is basically a no-go area! 
They are serious looking, black, grey menacing and intimidating..... until QiziQ!

 

QiziQ came from a simple question. Can I and Will I work out better if I loved what was doing and if it didn't feel like a punishment or after-school detention?
The family that was around the dinner table that evening started a  journey which culminated in..QIZIQ.
A fully customizable gym weight system that will match any budget, suit your taste your fetishes, save you space and above all persuade you work with it!




Risks & Challenges
During the QiziQ journey we faced many hurdles but I am glad had the best product designers who believed in the product and came up with the most inspiring solutions to the concept. Their years of experience came in very useful combined with their invaluable links to global manufacturers. This gave me access to world quality expertise but off-course this does not remove the risks associated with the launch of any new product.
QiziQ is a total re-invention of the gym weights industry and it's capability to enter the home, the hotel, the school and all other domains makes it unique and therefore susceptible to various challenges.
QiziQ faces the unique challenge of not being able to deliver promises due to inadequate funding which will cause it to fail on certain molds while delivering on the standard version without any issues. 

BUT, with your support we know that these are purely transient hurdles and we will engage them head on to create the same mold that delivers all those brilliantly personalized QiziQ cradles and weights.
We are confident of our ability to fully customize our weights to those that request this service.

We are committed to dispatching our stock range within 24 hours of order.

The Story

It all began around the kitchen table and led to the production of our first visual. The question that was asked that night was: What if I could have gym weights that look exactly the way I want them to look based on a fruit that I like...would that encourage more people to work out around the home?
Thus began the journey which has been carefully entered in our diary below:
The QiziQ Diary
Duku Design April 2016
We engaged a top UK design company to transform our doodles and sketches into a commercial product.
Progress May 2016 
The QiziQ weights begin to take shape following our design inspiration from nature. 

June 2016 The new weights get a name !
The birth of the name QiziQ 
After several days of brainstorming we landed on a name for the new gym weights
QUISQUE    - Latin name for fitness, and for ease of pronunciation it became  QIZIQ
 
Further thoughts during 2016
This is a home kit and must be space saving. The video above gives a good indication of the workout routines that are achievable. We recognized that a fully-fledged gym would not be easy within a small flat or hotel room. QiziQ is our solution to a daily toning workout, to kick up a good sweat and repeat again. Its flexible handle allows the user to save space and increase portability of the whole set from room to room and even when going away from home, QiziQ can be easily taken with you.
Further Inspiration and the invention of the QiziQ Cradle system


 
The Journey Continues
 
The QiziQ Cradle is born …
The spherical shape of the cradle and central axis mean different weight slices can be added in pairs and the center of mass remains constant (i.e. it won’t make the weight want to twist in the user’s hands).
QiziQ became a  multipurpose design, with a versatile connector handle system as well as a first ever - drop-in cradle loading system. After desired weights are loaded the user simply clicks the handle on and begins their workout. 

 
QiziQ reaches maturity 
The segments stack inside the cradle to give a complete range of weight combinations, they have a central metal core to provide the weight and rigidity with a rubber over-mold which can be textured/ colored and so on to give a variety of finishes.
QiziQ Final Product

Multi colored finishes - fully customizable to client's taste
Anti-roll faceted faces
Multiple connector handle to allow switching between Dumbbell, Barbell, Cable Weight and Barbell

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h3>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>We are carrying out a plan to create a healthier population! <strong> Our firm is using a multi-patent-pending combination of technology, hardware and people to solve the tremendous societal problem associated with medication mismanagement.</strong></p>
<p>In spite of the staggering impact medication nonadherence has on society, it rarely makes headlines in the media.  In 2016, the annual cost to the health care industry was approximately $528 billion (1).  The problems it creates for individuals’ health and their family members’ peace of mind goes beyond a monetary calculation.  The impact goes much deeper.  </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Bruce Pitcher.  I am a 25-year health care industry veteran and the president of MedSensible. I have extensive, first-hand experience with the challenges of medication management.  After the sudden death of my mom’s husband in 2010, I had the honor of helping her live the final seven years of her life with dignity.  Since my mom suffered from dementia and was on multiple medications, one of the biggest challenges was ensuring her proper medication management, administration and adherence. The formidable problems I encountered helping her are the same ones millions of people and their families experience every day. </p>
<p>One of the main reasons why medication mismanagement plagues society can be traced back to typical physician protocol.  They write prescriptions, but very rarely provide their patients any method, system or device to manage the prescriptions.  Patients are on their own! <strong> So, my team and I set out to create a comprehensive system that could overcome everyday medication management challenges and pitfalls. </strong>MedSensible and its corresponding products are the outcome of this significant undertaking, and it is an honor to share them with you.</p>

<p>Our flagship technology system is The Medication Manager.  It is an easy-to-use, state-of-the-art system that automates almost every aspect of medication administration.  It was uniquely designed to also help those with no computer skills or smart phone expertise, which is unbelievably helpful to the senior population. </p>
<p>The system’s collaboration platform is second to none and allows for real time interaction between patients, their physicians and their family members, regardless of their geographic location.  We call this the Support Team feature.  It’s a fine example of how the “power of numbers” can make a difference in medication compliance. </p>

<p>Our second product is a smart, electronic medication dispenser known as My Medication Station.  The first prototype has been completed and it is in beta testing. </p>
<p>My Medication Station eliminates the confusion of multiple pill bottles and organizes medications into a single location.  It’s an easy-to-operate device that houses a week’s supply of medication.</p>
<p>The video below provides you an animated view of My Medication Station's components.</p>

<div>Below is a video of our current prototype in action.  Note that the day of the week, Thursday, has all three compartments illuminated to distinguish it as the current day.  When the medication reminder triggers, the video screen changes to display the medication to be taken; the bin where the medication is located starts to flash; and the audio notification can be heard.  </div>

<p>Here are some additional photos of our prototype.  The final design will be updated to include a larger video screen.  Additionally, the materials that will be used for final manufacturing, and the device's color combination, will be modified to closely resemble the graphic rendering found in the My Medication Station introductory video above.</p>

<p>The dispenser’s technology is truly impressive.  It has both audio and touch-screen capability.  It’s also directly linked with The Medication Manager, thus allowing the combination of the two systems to deliver amazing features.  One of them is real-time notifications.  This is truly peace of mind for people who are concerned about an out-of-town loved one meeting their medication needs.  The dispenser can promptly notify them of a list of important situations: such as their loved one missing a medication intake or when a medication count is low and it is time for a refill.</p>

<p>Our third product is Mobile MedNurse.  It fosters one-on-one, at-home service for individuals that require extra help with their medication needs.</p>
<p>The Mobile MedNurse platform is essentially technology that delivers three important components to its users:</p>
<ul><li>First, it is an introductory forum where individuals seeking medication support can meet providers who deliver service in their area.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Second, through its proprietary field technology mobile app called All-Link, it provides uniform visit delivery standards and guidance to ensure exemplary interaction protocols are achieved and documented.  It also brings an individual’s physicians into the picture for superior collaboration. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Third, also derived from All-Link, it supplies the parties an efficient and effective billing and compensation forum.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>With its one-on-one interaction model, Mobile MedNurse is the ultimate in personal medication management advocacy.

<p><strong>Our Funding Needs</strong></p>
<p>The MedSensible offering consists of three products.  Two of the three are completed.  We are seeking $20,000 to finish the third product and to conduct the initial marketing launch of our complete offering in the Tampa Bay area.</p>
<p><strong>Funding Program and Allocation</strong></p>
<p>We have chosen a Flexible funding program.  All funds that are received will first be appropriated to the completion of My Medication Station.  Thereafter, the funding will be used to build inventory of the devices.  Finally, the balance will be appropriated toward the marketing roll out in Florida.  <strong>Funds that we receive over our campaign goal will be used to expand our offering on a national basis.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>We are proud to offer everyone that supports us with a $25.00 donation a subscription to the base model of our flagship technology system, The Medication Manager.  The subscription also comes with a valuable discount card we call the Patient Appreciation Lifestyle Reward.  The discounts are available for travel, meals, concerts and much more.  Some of the participating retailers are Hilton and Best Buy.  The discount reward is immediately sent to the email address used to create the account at The Medication Manager.</p>
<p>For those individuals who contribute $250 to us, we are pleased to reward the generous support with our smart medication dispenser, My Medication Station. That is approximately 50 percent below our retail price of $495.00.   </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>It was an unbelievably challenging experience for me to help my mom through her final years.  As I looked back on that time, I came up with a saying that will resonate with almost everyone at some point in his or her life.  The statement is as follows:</p>
<h3 align=""center"">
<i>“If you live long enough, and your parents live long </i><i>enough, you WILL become your parents’ parent.”</i>
</h3>
<p>The vision is to make life better for people taking medication and their family members.  I do not want people to struggle with medication management like I did. MedSensible’s offering overcomes the pitfalls that I encountered, and many, many more.  It paves a much smoother path for those who will, at some point, walk in my shoes.   </p>
<p>We are right on the cusp of delivering a comprehensive medication management solution that society has needed for a long time.  We can change lives with MedSensible.  So, I would like to respectfully ask you join us in our quest by becoming a backer.  You can be assured your financial support of MedSensible is an investment in both health and humanity.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The market for solving the medication management dilemma is very fragmented.  There are a lot of companies that produce one tool or another aimed at overcoming the problem. <strong>Our plan employs three distinctive components to separate us from the competition. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>
<p>There are risks associated with our offering.  Most of the risks are inherent in any new company’s path to success.  Accordingly, the biggest risk we face is a competitor with sizeable market share expanding their offering to mirror our pricing structure and comprehensive approach. </p>
<p>There are three barriers to entry a competitor will face is they decide to challenge us on these fronts.  The first is time.  It will take a competitor a sizeable amount of time to build what we have created.  During that window, we fully expect to be able to build market share and product loyalty.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Another barrier a competitor faces is the pending patents associated with our products.  These patents provide a formidable obstacle for duplication of the MedSensible offering. We are prepared to defend the intellectual property associated with the patients.</p>
<p>The third barrier a competitor must overcome is our pricing structure.  Because of our technology, the unique business models of our offering’s products and our company’s low overhead, we have been able to establish price points well below the majority of our competitors.  We can maintain our current pricing structure and achieve solid profit margins.  Our competitors typically do not enjoy this positioning, and therefore, would cease to be profitable if they chose to compete with us on pricing.      </p>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge we have right now is our financial condition.  We need to raise money to complete My Medication Station and roll out our offering in Florida.  We anticipate overcoming our financial constraints in July 2020.</p>
<p>The second challenge we face is technology related.  It is no secret that technology can have bugs and malfunctions.  Although our systems have been beta tested and some are currently operational in the field, we fully expect to find there are minor flaws in our technology.  We are fully prepared to promptly address and repair any system defects.</p>
<p>A third noteworthy challenge we face is our lack of notoriety.  The MedSensible name is new to the health care industry.  Hence, we must create awareness for the company and its corresponding offering of products.  We are very optimistic that the implementation of our Territory Ownership Program will generate the notoriety we need to capture market share.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not in a position where you can provide us financial support, you can still be a part of the solution to society’s medication management quandary.  First, we encourage you to enroll for a free subscription to The Medication Manager and download its mobile app from iTunes or Google Play.  You can then begin using its tremendous features for your medication administration or that of any family member.</p>
<p>Second, simply tell your friends and family about MedSensible and your experience with The Medication Manager.  Helping them become aware of our offering’s wide range of solutions to medication management problems will foster our grass-roots effort to create a healthier population.</p>

Introduction
We are carrying out a plan to create a healthier population!  Our firm is using a multi-patent-pending combination of technology, hardware and people to solve the tremendous societal problem associated with medication mismanagement.
In spite of the staggering impact medication nonadherence has on society, it rarely makes headlines in the media.  In 2016, the annual cost to the health care industry was approximately $528 billion (1).  The problems it creates for individuals’ health and their family members’ peace of mind goes beyond a monetary calculation.  The impact goes much deeper.  
Hello, my name is Bruce Pitcher.  I am a 25-year health care industry veteran and the president of MedSensible. I have extensive, first-hand experience with the challenges of medication management.  After the sudden death of my mom’s husband in 2010, I had the honor of helping her live the final seven years of her life with dignity.  Since my mom suffered from dementia and was on multiple medications, one of the biggest challenges was ensuring her proper medication management, administration and adherence. The formidable problems I encountered helping her are the same ones millions of people and their families experience every day. 
One of the main reasons why medication mismanagement plagues society can be traced back to typical physician protocol.  They write prescriptions, but very rarely provide their patients any method, system or device to manage the prescriptions.  Patients are on their own!  So, my team and I set out to create a comprehensive system that could overcome everyday medication management challenges and pitfalls. MedSensible and its corresponding products are the outcome of this significant undertaking, and it is an honor to share them with you.

Pending Patents and Business Models

The Medication Manager
  

 
Our flagship technology system is The Medication Manager.  It is an easy-to-use, state-of-the-art system that automates almost every aspect of medication administration.  It was uniquely designed to also help those with no computer skills or smart phone expertise, which is unbelievably helpful to the senior population.

Our second product is a smart, electronic medication dispenser known as My Medication Station.  The first prototype has been completed and it is in beta testing. 
My Medication Station eliminates the confusion of multiple pill bottles and organizes medications into a single location.  It’s an easy-to-operate device that houses a week’s supply of medication.
The video below provides you an animated view of My Medication Station's components.

 
Below is a video of our current prototype in action.  Note that the day of the week, Thursday, has all three compartments illuminated to distinguish it as the current day.  When the medication reminder triggers, the video screen changes to display the medication to be taken; the bin where the medication is located starts to flash; and the audio notification can be heard.  
 

 
Here are some additional photos of our prototype.  The final design will be updated to include a larger video screen.  Additionally, the materials that will be used for final manufacturing, and the device's color combination, will be modified to closely resemble the graphic rendering found in the My Medication Station introductory video above.

<p>Growing up here in Olathe I always knew I wanted to give back to my community. As a student athlete that also worked almost full time, I never paid much attention to what I was doing to my body, always on the go I’d stop in to whatever fast food place sounded good at the time, I wasn’t phased by it one bit. Fast forward 12 years and 4 kids later, I have realized the importance of living a healthy lifestyle. Not only does that include what I eat, but my physical activities as well.</p>
<p>As Head Cheerleading coach at Olathe North, it became apparent to me that our youth is still under the same intense schedule as I once was with little time to truly focus on providing their body with the proper nutrients or even having an understanding of what that actually looks like.</p>
<p>With those things in mind Pulse Nutrition &amp; Fitness was created. Truly Olathe owned, with every one of you in mind. The purpose of Pulse Nutrition is to promote Health and Wellness in the community by providing the tools and resources needed for effective nutrition planning and physical exercise.</p>
<p>Pulse was created to help guide and inspire our friends, family, customer and clients through their personal, health, and wealth journey. Everything we do is done with the intention to INSPIRE CHANGE AND OFFER GUIDANCE. Every person has a journey they’re on, we want to be there for through each of them. We truly believe in creating not just healthy bodies but healthy lifestyles.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>

<p>I am so excited about this opportunity. 60% of the total startup amount will be funded with contributions from the Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, 40% owners capital and all of the funding will be used on the final build out of our business location,  supplies,  inventory, insurance, and signage.</p>
<p>I am asking for contributions in the amount of  $10 or more if possible,  anything is greatly appreciated! Even if monetary contributions aren't an option right now, a share with your friends and family could make all the difference.   </p>
<p>What if we don't reach our goal you ask. Not to worry, we will adjust our design concept within the club to fit within our means. The great thing about our club is, no matter what it looks like on the inside,  everyone will always feel welcome and at home</p>

I am a family man who is devoted to serving others in any and every way I can. Many of you will remember the earthquake that devastated Haiti back in 2010. The opportunity to help presented itself to me and it was one opportunity I could not deny nor will I ever forget. During my time supporting the relief effort in Haiti, I experienced something that changed my life forever. A fire was set in my soul to make a difference for those who are less fortunate, and to provide a resource that would give those the ability to conduct the most rudimentary hygiene activities/needs. The job I speak of is the ability to clean one’s teeth.</p><p><i>​<strong><u>The Beginning</u></strong></i></p><p>Several years ago, I had an idea for a dental product that could be used anytime and anywhere without needing or having access to water. After my time in Haiti I asked myself, “How do people get water to brush their teeth when their local water isn't potable or if they don't have ANY ACCESS to water?""  Finally I then wondered,  ""How is this unfortunate event being corrected?""  I expanded on this question with an idea and fast forward to 2015 when it finally became a reality.</p><p><i><strong><u>The Product</u></strong></i></p><p>RipTube Toothpowder. The original single serving Tooth Powder on the market. RipTube is lightweight, easy to carry and easy to use. Best of all you don't need water to use it. RipTube is currently available in a <u>minty</u> flavor and with the funds I aim to raise, more refreshing and exciting new flavors will be added!</p><p><i><strong><u>How you use it</u></strong></i></p><p>Just rip the end of the tube (stick pack), and pour the powder in your mouth (or on your toothbrush). The powder reacts to your saliva causing a complete foaming effect that cleanses every inch of your mouth. From there, you brush how you would regularly, or you can swish it around like mouthwash. Then spit it out! Simple, right?</p><p><i><strong><u>Contributions</u></strong></i></p><p><strong> </strong>The potential areas where RipTube can provide great and constant dental health are endless. There are 7 billion people in the world, all with one thing in common – we all need dental hygiene to maintain proper oral health. Imagine all the people who will be able to effectively take care of their teeth, people that currently do not have the resources or opportunity to do so.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Area One</strong>: 2.5 billion people don't have access to adequate sanitation and over 783 million people don't have access to clean water. This is just one of the areas of our world that will be greatly impacted by a product like RipTube.</li>
<li>
<strong>Area Two</strong>: The homeless! This is a rising epidemic.  There are currently 500,000 homeless people in the United States and 125,000 of those are children. Not to mention the millions more across the world. Think about refugees.</li>
<li>
<strong>Area Three:</strong> It can be placed in care packages for all military personnel and in food rations for all humanitarian relief efforts during times of natural disasters. <ul><li>According to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, over <u>218 Million people</u> have been impacted by natural disasters over the last 20 years. From 1994 to 2013 there were <u>6,873 natural disasters</u> world wide. THINK about the impact here if RipTube was put in the care packages to assist all these people! </li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Area Four: </strong>RipTube can help assist the elderly with teeth cleaning when basic motor functions fail to work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Area Five:</strong> Our toothpowder can be utilized in Hospitals all over the world for emergency rooms and to help assist with cleaning, sanitizing, and treating mouth wounds.</li>
</ul><p align=""center""><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><u>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</u></strong></p><p><i><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><u><font>Down to the nitty gritty (What we need)</font></u></strong></i></p><p> We need to raise <strong><u>$90,000</u> </strong>to make RipTube happen in all planned aspects! This means we will be able to finalize the Research and Development with our chemist on standby  (<i><u>$35,000</u></i>), Acquisition and Production of the final ingredients upon chemist approval (<i><u>$25,000</u></i>), Distribution of RipTube (<i><u>$15,000</u></i>), and Marketing to include a website design (<i><u>$5,000 to $10,000</u></i>). If this doesn’t make any sense, we need the money to streamline the product to put it in stores and provide it to those who are less fortunate.</p><p align=""center"">(This is the second round of funding).</p><p><i><strong><u>So, what does this mean</u></strong></i></p><p>With the first round of funding we took what was an idea and brought it to life through extensive R&amp;D within the market. The previous round helped with creating a functional product that became tangible and was distributed to interested businesses for sampling. It also assisted with Trademarks and Patents as well as Designs for packaging and squaring away the logistics once the product is finalized (with your help of course)!!!After much deliberation, requests and suggestions were made and that has brought us to <strong><u>HERE &amp; NOW</u>.</strong></p><ul><li>Although, the product cleans your teeth effectively, it does not taste too pleasant to most that have tried it. That is where the funding comes in. Some of the money will go directly to an FDA certified chemist who can transform the current product into a better effective and tasty formula. We are doing this based off feedback we received from our customers and businesses nationwide, ""<strong>Y<u>ou spoke and we listened</u></strong>"". The chemist will also create a few unique flavor lines for RipTube. This includes 3 different flavors that allow RipTube Tooth Powder to be more appealing to more people (everybody's taste buds are different). The rest of the money will go toward acquisition of ingredients, distribution and pushing this product in front of more organizations and businesses in the dental hygiene field that showed previous interest. This will help us grow tremendously! There is currently a decent sized company (roughly 100 stores in the U.S) that is intrigued in giving RipTube a test run once the final product is complete. </li></ul><p align=""center""><strong><u>WHAT IS IN IT FOR YOU???</u></strong> </p><p><i><strong><u>What you get</u></strong></i></p><p> I don't know where to begin! There will be a good amount of tier leveled perks available.</p><ul>
<li>Well first off just by donating anything, this means that you believe in what RipTube stands for. ""Helping us change the way the people of the world brush their teeth, one mouth at a time."" We want to reach those individuals that do not have the current capabilities to perform the rudimentary task of brushing their teeth. Thanks for taking the journey with us.</li>
<li>Secondly, it takes guts and faith to go out on a limb and support such a new and useful cause/product as this. Kudos to you!!!</li>
</ul><p align=""center""><strong><u>TANGIBLE &amp; COMMEMORATIVE  ITEMS!!!</u></strong> </p><ul><li> We are going to be giving out RipTube EVERYTHING. You have to click through the perks on the right to find out which one is right for you. In general, we are going to be giving away:<ul><li> Limited Edition Hoodie Sweaters,Hats, Shirts, Tooth Powder Products (Both Original and Revamped Flavors created by the Chemist), Bottle Opener Challenge Coins, Coffee Mugs, Opportunities to Cameo in a commercial and the chance to have your photographic talent used for our new packaging. On top of that, you will be able to be apart of a true humanitarian outreach with the RipTube team. Keep reading below for more thorough info!!!<ul>
<li>We will be making <strong><i><u>advertisements</u></i></strong> and you could star in the upcoming RipTube commercials. This is huge because it isn't every day that you get to be an actor or actress let alone a cameo in an advertisement for a product you backed with donations and believe in.</li>
<li>You could also choose one of the next <strong><i><u>flavors</u></i></strong> for RipTube.</li>
<li>To top it off, you will have the opportunity to do some <strong><i><u>modeling</u></i></strong> for our next product box design. This means your mug could be on the newest RipTube box being sold in stores and you will be the first thing that Big Businesses will see when looking at our product. What an awesome trophy to put on your shelf!  </li>
<li>RipTube can be taken and used ANYWHERE so you might just end up in Tahiti (or downtown Miami/Orlando/Tampa/Daytona) on a <i><strong><u>photo shoot</u></strong></i> for the next box designs, who knows!!</li>

I am a family man who is devoted to serving others in any and every way I can. Many of you will remember the earthquake that devastated Haiti back in 2010. The opportunity to help presented itself to me and it was one opportunity I could not deny nor will I ever forget. During my time supporting the relief effort in Haiti, I experienced something that changed my life forever. A fire was set in my soul to make a difference for those who are less fortunate, and to provide a resource that would give those the ability to conduct the most rudimentary hygiene activities/needs. The job I speak of is the ability to clean one’s teeth.​The BeginningSeveral years ago, I had an idea for a dental product that could be used anytime and anywhere without needing or having access to water. After my time in Haiti I asked myself, “How do people get water to brush their teeth when their local water isn't potable or if they don't have ANY ACCESS to water?""  Finally I then wondered,  ""How is this unfortunate event being corrected?""  I expanded on this question with an idea and fast forward to 2015 when it finally became a reality.The ProductRipTube Toothpowder. The original single serving Tooth Powder on the market. RipTube is lightweight, easy to carry and easy to use. Best of all you don't need water to use it. RipTube is currently available in a minty flavor and with the funds I aim to raise, more refreshing and exciting new flavors will be added!How you use itJust rip the end of the tube (stick pack), and pour the powder in your mouth (or on your toothbrush). The powder reacts to your saliva causing a complete foaming effect that cleanses every inch of your mouth. From there, you brush how you would regularly, or you can swish it around like mouthwash. Then spit it out! Simple, right?Contributions The potential areas where RipTube can provide great and constant dental health are endless. There are 7 billion people in the world, all with one thing in common – we all need dental hygiene to maintain proper oral health. Imagine all the people who will be able to effectively take care of their teeth, people that currently do not have the resources or opportunity to do so.

Area One: 2.5 billion people don't have access to adequate sanitation and over 783 million people don't have access to clean water. This is just one of the areas of our world that will be greatly impacted by a product like RipTube.

Area Two: The homeless! This is a rising epidemic.  There are currently 500,000 homeless people in the United States and 125,000 of those are children. Not to mention the millions more across the world. Think about refugees.

Area Three: It can be placed in care packages for all military personnel and in food rations for all humanitarian relief efforts during times of natural disasters. According to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, over 218 Million people have been impacted by natural disasters over the last 20 years. From 1994 to 2013 there were 6,873 natural disasters world wide. THINK about the impact here if RipTube was put in the care packages to assist all these people! 


Area Four: RipTube can help assist the elderly with teeth cleaning when basic motor functions fail to work.

Area Five: Our toothpowder can be utilized in Hospitals all over the world for emergency rooms and to help assist with cleaning, sanitizing, and treating mouth wounds.
WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GETDown to the nitty gritty (What we need) We need to raise $90,000 to make RipTube happen in all planned aspects! This means we will be able to finalize the Research and Development with our chemist on standby  ($35,000), Acquisition and Production of the final ingredients upon chemist approval ($25,000), Distribution of RipTube ($15,000), and Marketing to include a website design ($5,000 to $10,000). If this doesn’t make any sense, we need the money to streamline the product to put it in stores and provide it to those who are less fortunate.(This is the second round of funding).So, what does this meanWith the first round of funding we took what was an idea and brought it to life through extensive R&D within the market. The previous round helped with creating a functional product that became tangible and was distributed to interested businesses for sampling. It also assisted with Trademarks and Patents as well as Designs for packaging and squaring away the logistics once the product is finalized (with your help of course)!!!After much deliberation, requests and suggestions were made and that has brought us to HERE & NOW.Although, the product cleans your teeth effectively, it does not taste too pleasant to most that have tried it. That is where the funding comes in. Some of the money will go directly to an FDA certified chemist who can transform the current product into a better effective and tasty formula. We are doing this based off feedback we received from our customers and businesses nationwide, ""You spoke and we listened"". The chemist will also create a few unique flavor lines for RipTube. This includes 3 different flavors that allow RipTube Tooth Powder to be more appealing to more people (everybody's taste buds are different). The rest of the money will go toward acquisition of ingredients, distribution and pushing this product in front of more organizations and businesses in the dental hygiene field that showed previous interest. This will help us grow tremendously! There is currently a decent sized company (roughly 100 stores in the U.S) that is intrigued in giving RipTube a test run once the final product is complete. WHAT IS IN IT FOR YOU??? What you get I don't know where to begin! There will be a good amount of tier leveled perks available.
Well first off just by donating anything, this means that you believe in what RipTube stands for. ""Helping us change the way the people of the world brush their teeth, one mouth at a time."" We want to reach those individuals that do not have the current capabilities to perform the rudimentary task of brushing their teeth. Thanks for taking the journey with us.
Secondly, it takes guts and faith to go out on a limb and support such a new and useful cause/product as this. Kudos to you!!!
TANGIBLE & COMMEMORATIVE  ITEMS!!!  We are going to be giving out RipTube EVERYTHING. You have to click through the perks on the right to find out which one is right for you. In general, we are going to be giving away: Limited Edition Hoodie Sweaters,Hats, Shirts, Tooth Powder Products (Both Original and Revamped Flavors created by the Chemist), Bottle Opener Challenge Coins, Coffee Mugs, Opportunities to Cameo in a commercial and the chance to have your photographic talent used for our new packaging. On top of that, you will be able to be apart of a true humanitarian outreach with the RipTube team. Keep reading below for more thorough info!!!
We will be making advertisements and you could star in the upcoming RipTube commercials. This is huge because it isn't every day that you get to be an actor or actress let alone a cameo in an advertisement for a product you backed with donations and believe in.
You could also choose one of the next flavors for RipTube.
To top it off, you will have the opportunity to do some modeling for our next product box design. This means your mug could be on the newest RipTube box being sold in stores and you will be the first thing that Big Businesses will see when looking at our product. What an awesome trophy to put on your shelf!  
RipTube can be taken and used ANYWHERE so you might just end up in Tahiti (or downtown Miami/Orlando/Tampa/Daytona) on a photo shoot for the next box designs, who knows!!
Do you have a great photographic eye? Your picture could be used for our next box design. There are certain criteria for the photographs we are looking for. Check out the perk for more info.
At RipTube we want to always pay it forward. You could have the opportunity to travel with US and a Humanitarian organization to a place where people are in need. While you are there, you will be handing out RipTube to those who really need some dental hygiene help! What a way to give back. TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK!!!

MSDs represent 30% of all UK cases of work-related ill health (excluding cancer and other long-latency illnesses).In the EU there are over 25 million MSD affected workers costing €290 billion each year.The Sit Straight Active Posture Trainer is a unique product. The posture corrector that you do not have to wear.  The solution provided by the Sit Straight Active Posture Trainer,  addresses the worldwide problem that increasingly affects millions of people each year. Poor postural activity during prolonged periods of sitting. Over time, repetitive periods of poor postural activity can develop into chronic pain conditions that ultimately have a negative impact on quality of life at work, at home and place restrictions on the ability to enjoy leisure activities.The top layer is constructed from black neoprene which is comfortable under foot and easy to keep clean. The middle layer contains the sensors and the base layer is constructed from laminated rubber which has excellent non-slip properties.  All three layers are bonded together and have a practical sealed edge.  The mat can be rolled and stored in its bag.""Over the years I have been inundated with cases of musculoskeletal and postural issues from people who spend their days at a desk. The simple advice has always been to plant the feet firmly on the floor while sitting, pressing them into the floor with sufficient pressure to feel a reaction of uprighting in the spine. I found that the majority of people try with the best of intentions to do so, but soon forget and drift back into old habits. I wanted to design a product that would provide a constant reinforcement and a reminder to maintain good floor contact and pressure through the feet. And so the idea of the Sit Straight Active Posture Trainer was born.""www.rehabps.com As a client of Karl White’s, Paul was immobilised  before he underwent treatment. He knows first-hand the remarkable results achievable through DNS rehabilitation.  He shares Karl’s passion for and belief in The Sit Straigt Active Posture Trainer.With his experience in managing Major Incident Rooms and the presentation of complex evidential issues in high profile murder cases, he is well acquainted with the use of media platforms to accurately convey information and ideas.The Sit Straight Active Posture Trainer is different to existing posture correction devices....Postural activity in any position is simply a learned reaction within the body to direction and amount of pressure against points of support and cannot be correctly improved by simply strapping on a support or brace that pulls your shoulders back and down for example.The Sit Straight Active Posture Trainer fits discreetly under your desk or workstation. On first use, a short calibration process is completed and saved for individual users in the event that the computer or workstation is a shared resource.Data from sensors in the mat is sent by wireless connection to your computer or workstation and will be displayed in a transparent window in the corner of your screen on top of any other open windows.Through on screen prompts, the user will learn how to establish the optimal ground force contact necessary, to train and maintain an active postural musculature during prolonged sitting periods.This will facilitate natural involuntary reflex responses in the deep spinal and the core stabilization muscle layers responsible for controlling postural activity.The Sit Straight Active Posture Trainer will constantly monitor pressure input from the user with realtime constant feedback and on screen prompts.  A timer can be set for 30 second intervals within a range of 1 minute up to 15 minutes.  Using for just 5 minutes in each hour is sufficient to re-establish and train to maintain,  optimal postural activity throughout the working day. 

 
 By subconsciously reinforcing optimal postural activity during prolonged sitting periods, overall spinal health will quickly improve.  Proper postural function will be restored and all manner of poor posture related issues will be addressed, ultimately not only reducing pain,But also,...easing tension, improving mobility, improving sleep, improving concentration, improving respiratory function, improving circulation and digestion. Â The longer term benefits are renewed energy levels and a new lease of life for the individual user.  Benefits to EmployersUK Employers must protect the health and safety of their workers, including home workers, under the Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992.  Similar legislation is in force in Europe, USA and many other countries.  Employers must carry out workstation assessments and introduce control measures in respect of identified risks. They must also consider making ‘Reasonable adjustments’ to address issues raised by workers regarding their working environment.  A wise employer will record the action taken to deal with these matters including which control measures or reasonable adjustments were introduced and their rationale for why they were introduced or rejected.  Such records may be invaluable to prove or defend an employer's actions at any employment tribunal or other legal proceedings brought by a worker or the Health & Safety Executive.The following guidance on the law is taken from the UK Health and Safety Executive publication, “Managing upper limb disorders in the workplace” :“As an employer, you need to protect your workers from the risk of injury and ill health from upper limb disorders (ULDs) in the workplace.  ULDs include aches and pains in the shoulders, arms, wrists,hands and fingers, as well as in the neck.

Design workplaces and equipment so that workers do not have to adopt awkward postures. 
Arrange the position, height and layout of the workstation so it is comfortable to reach and appropriate for the work. 
Consider providing adjustable chairs and footrests, and suitable tools.
The following is taken from the UK Health and Safety Executive publication, “Working with display screen equipment (DSE)” :“Some workers may experience fatigue, eye strain, upper limb problems and backache from overuse or improper use of DSE. These problems can also be experienced from poorly designed workstations or work environments.  The causes may not always be obvious and can be due to a combination of factors”.“If you employ many users of DSE, it may help to appoint an assessor to:

<p><strong>Volume</strong>: The middle meter represents your volume, and it will fluctuate vertically from the center based on your volume projected. The optimal position to be in is the center of the meter, and you will be able to swiftly identify whether you are too loud or too soft depending on the tracker's distance and position from the optimal point, allowing you to adjust your volume accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Words Per Minute</strong>: The last meter from the left represents your words per minute, or WPM for short. Same as volume, the optimal position to be in is the center of the meter, and you will be able to swiftly identify whether you are speaking too fast or slow depending on the tracker's distance and position from the optimal point, allowing you to slow down or speed up accordingly.</p>

<p>“Dictito <strong>helps me realize what’s wrong with my speed and tone.</strong> Not only can Dictito spot these points, it can also help me to correct them. I feel much more confident when doing my pitch with Dictito.” - Hong Vãn, Student, SMU</p>
<p>“I think it will be helpful to have a device like Dictito that can <strong>monitor my presentation performance metrics </strong>especially when I rehearse alone, since I tend to memorize my script when preparing for presentations.” - Wen Wei, Student, SMU</p>
<p>“Dictito is just like a personal speech coach. Easy and simple to understand, it has <strong>boosted my skills in speech and confidence </strong>before each presentation. I will definitely recommend this to anyone who needs help in public speaking in any form” - Yin Jie, Student, SUTD</p>

Supplies are affected by resources available and demands, and we will try our best to ensure that the suppliers are able to provide us with consistent support. Should this problem surface, we would expect delays and increased lead-times for our products, which will naturally spillover to our customers and backers.</p>
<p>2) Certifications issues. We are aware that there is a need for our product to be certified locally and internationally to be sold worldwide, and we will definitely engage in the relevant board testings to ensure that our product is certified safe and commercially viable, such as the FCC and CE.</p>
<p>3) Manufacturing issues. Dictito pledges to uphold a high standard of quality control during all phases of manufacturing, but unforeseen issues can arise during production and installation, which may slip through our control. Hence, it is possible that certain batches of the product may end up with flaws that will compromise the entire product.

Presentations can be a nightmare for a lot of people, and most people suffer sub-optimal performances due to a variety of reasons, such as insufficient and poor preparation beforehand. With Dictito SpeechBox, you can now better prepare yourself for a presentation, by understanding which performance metric you are under-performing in, such as pitch or volume. Our post-rehearsal analysis report will help you focus on your poorer aspects, allowing you to target your weaknesses and improve more efficiently, becoming a better presenter and speaker.

Dictito SpeechBox can also be deployed during the actual presentation itself, allowing you to monitor your presentation in real-time, and keep track of your performance metrics through an intuitive and visually simple user interface. 

 


Although a good presentation consists more than just speaking well and eloquently, we at Dictito believe that strong foundations in speaking and articulating are essential and will go a long way to helping you grow as a presenter and speaker. It is only after mastering the basics of speech that you will be able to tackle other aspects of a presentation, such as content curation. 

Our research showed us that the fundamental tenets of a presentation revolves around certain speech metrics, and we have consolidated them to help you understand how you can improve better. Certain preset settings have been programmed into the device in the default state, which will help you kick start your journey of improvement, and as you grow as a speaker and presenter, you can tweak these settings to your desired levels so that the device can help you keep track of them in real-time. 

Rehearsal Mode
Monitor your practice in a private space without having to depend on friends. Receive a post-rehearsal feedback report, with data and analysis on the various presentation metrics to help you improve as a presenter. 

As part of our commitment to help you improve as a speaker, the device also comes with an online support in the form of a feedback report. Using data analytics and tracking, along with a well-presented report template, we can help you understand which aspects of your rehearsal requires attention on, so that you can better focus on the essential parts. The report will be generated after each rehearsal conducted in ""Rehearsal Mode"", and will be sent to your personal email for your viewing. 
Presentation Mode
Receive real time feedback during the presentation and adapt your delivery on the go.

In ""Presentation Mode"", the user interface is able to convey real-time feedback to you as you present, through the 3 meters on the interface and its background. 

Time Remaining: The background will start off as a full single color, and it will gradually fade to black downwards as time elapses during the presentation, eventually turning the entire background of the UI black, signalling to you that the presentation time is up.
Pitch: The first meter from the left represents your pitch variation, and it will contract or expand vertically according to the range of pitch that you are displaying. It will take reference from data collected in the last 10 seconds from the current time, to ensure that the meter is constantly updating to reflect the current situation. The wider the range of variation, the better your presentation will sound.
Volume: The middle meter represents your volume, and it will fluctuate vertically from the center based on your volume projected. The optimal position to be in is the center of the meter, and you will be able to swiftly identify whether you are too loud or too soft depending on the tracker's distance and position from the optimal point, allowing you to adjust your volume accordingly.
Words Per Minute: The last meter from the left represents your words per minute, or WPM for short. Same as volume, the optimal position to be in is the center of the meter, and you will be able to swiftly identify whether you are speaking too fast or slow depending on the tracker's distance and position from the optimal point, allowing you to slow down or speed up accordingly.

<p style=""color:#fff;""> </p>
<p style=""color:#fff;""><strong>16. What is UV?</strong></p>
<p style=""color:#fff;"">Everyone would have had an experience of peeling off your skin when your playing at the beach in hot summer. This is the phenomenon that the UV rays contained in the sunshine break down the DNA in the Cell, and the dead cell leaves the skin tissue. Thus, UV light has the physio-chemical energy to destroy the micro-sized cell or bacteria, and that applies same in the Cutetok.</p>
<p style=""color:#fff;""> </p>
<p style=""color:#fff;""><strong>17. Why do you use UV ray to eliminate the germ?</strong></p>
<p style=""color:#fff;"">The light emiited from the UV lamp of Cutetok is UV(UV-C) light included in the sunlight and as we explained the way of UV break down the cell in article 16. In addition, UV light can inhibit the growth of bacteria and viruses.</p>

<p style=""color:#fff;""> </p>
<p style=""color:#fff;""><strong>19. Does this sound during while operating?</strong></p>

<p style=""color:#fff;""><strong>20. Does Cutetok generate the ozone during the disinfection?</strong></p>
<p style=""color:#fff;"">Cutetok has a special-designed UV lamp that reduces harmful ozone emissions by up to 90%. No worry for you and your baby about silicon corrosion!</p>

Stainless reflector can spread the UV ray to cover the dirty stuff and is much more hygenic than plastic
 
16. What is UV?
Everyone would have had an experience of peeling off your skin when your playing at the beach in hot summer. This is the phenomenon that the UV rays contained in the sunshine break down the DNA in the Cell, and the dead cell leaves the skin tissue. Thus, UV light has the physio-chemical energy to destroy the micro-sized cell or bacteria, and that applies same in the Cutetok.
 
17. Why do you use UV ray to eliminate the germ?
The light emiited from the UV lamp of Cutetok is UV(UV-C) light included in the sunlight and as we explained the way of UV break down the cell in article 16. In addition, UV light can inhibit the growth of bacteria and viruses.

No, Cutetok isn't waterproof.

WE ARE INTRODUCING A REVOLUTIONARYmiomove CONCEPT  Our concept is based on a unique technology of carbon nanosensors that has been successfully completed after several years of development, in cooperation with our partner: 

 
Thanks to their nanocomposite layer structure, these sensors have an exclusive ability to respond almost linearly to the slight changes in the forces they exert.

 
Our next task is to create truly unique and functional prototypes of running, cycling and football smart shoes with your support!
Our sensors will provide maximally important information about various sports activities.

 
Our sensors are specially engineered for an integration into both the insole and the vamp. This will allow us to evaluate not only the footprint but also the other forces within the shoe.
 

 
This technology is suitable not only for running, performance evaluation or the right cycling technique,

but will also accurately evaluate the kick technique with the soccer ball, which will be beneficial for junior football players and their coaches.

 
The development of the sensors themselves was really challenging and now we also need your support.Come with us to complete the miomove Smart Shoe. Its revolutionary technology can obtain information about the technique and effectiveness of your physical activity. 

 
We want to help people with active lifestyle, athletes, handicapped people and last but not least patients who have to learn to walk again.

 
Our sensors can gather as accurate information about footprints as medical equipment worth hundreds of thousand dollars.
Unique smart shoe technology can also provide the right development of the baby's foot.
Healthy foot

 
Flat foot

 
Video

 
Then, with your help we will be also able to insert this technology into the shoe.

 
Every donation takes this project a step forward. 
It does not matter whether you are running, cycling, playing tennis or football.
It is important that you do the exercise properly and at the same time improve yourself in what you are doing.

 

Each and every wrong technique may have a negative impact on your performance, whether it's exhaustion, spinal pain or excessive muscular system wear off.With the help of specialists, the miomove team develops its own 3D anatomy enabling us to better visualize not only the accuracy of your physical exercise but also to present you various studies and lectures.

 

 
 


We mean it seriously and because this concept is truly unique, we have prepared an exclusive gifts for you for your contribution. Simultaneously with the development of sensors, we are developing a sports mobile application and 3D anatomy developed by a team of experienced programmers and graphics.

PŘEDSTAVUJEME VÁM REVOLUČNÍ KONCEPT
miomove:​
 

 
Tento koncept je založený na unikátní technologii speciálních uhlíkových nanosenzorů, které se nám po několika letech vývoje podařilo úspěšně dokončit, a to ve spolupráci s našim partnerem, kterým je:
 


 
Tyto senzory mají díky své struktuře nanokompozitních vrstev, exklusivní schopnost téměř lineárně reagovat i na nepatrné změny sil, které na ně působí​:

 
Našim dalším úkolem bude s vaší pomocí vytvořit opravdu unikátní a funkční prototypy běžeckých, cyklistických a fotbalových chytrých bot!
Senzory budou poté poskytovat maximálně hodnotné informace o různých sportovních aktivitách:

 
Naše senzory jsou speciálně technologicky uzpůsobené pro integraci jak do stélky, tak i do svršku boty. Díky tomu budeme moci vyhodnotit nejenom došlap, ale i ostatní síly uvnitř boty:
 

 
Tato technologie poté bude vhodná nejen pro běh nebo k vyhodnocení výkonu a správné techniky šlapání na kole:

ale taky přesně vyhodnotí techniku kopu do fotbalového míče, což bude přínosem i pro juniorské fotbalisty a jejich trenéry:

 
Vývoj samotných senzorů byl opravdu náročný a nyní potřebujeme i vaši pomoc.
Pojďte s námi dokončit miomove Smart Shoe. Její revoluční technologie dokáže získat informace o technice a efektivitě vaší pohybové aktivity.

 
Chceme pomoci lidem s aktivním životním stylem, atletům, handicapovaným lidem a v neposlední řadě i pacientům, kteří se musejí znovu učit chodit.

Naše senzory mohou díky svým unikátním vlastnostem získávat stejně přesné informace o došlapu, jako zdravotnické zařízení v hodnotě milionů korun.
 
Tato unikátní technologie může také podchytit správný vývoj dětského chodidla:
Zdravá noha

 
Plochá noha

 
Video

 
A tuto technologii můžeme s vaší pomocí nyní dostat i do boty:

 
Každý váš příspěvek posune tento projekt o kus dál.
Nezáleží na tom, jestli běháte, jezdíte na kole, hrajete tenis nebo fotbal, důležité je, abyste pohybovou aktivitu prováděli správně a zároveň se tak zlepšovali v tom, co děláte.

 

Každá nesprávná technika může mít negativní dopad na Váš výkon, ať už je to únava, bolesti páteře nebo nadměrné opotřebení  pohybové soustavy.
Tým miomove proto s pomocí odborných lékařů vyvíjí i vlastní 3D anatomii, pomocí které například budeme schopni nejenom lépe vizualizovat správnost techniky vaší pohybové aktivity, ale i vám představit různé odborné studie a přednášky. 

 

 
 

 

Myslíme to vážně, a protože je náš koncept jedinečný a vaše pomoc opravdu důležitá, chceme vám nabídnout i hodnotné dárky. Společně s vývojem senzorů vyvíjí náš tým zkušených programátorů a grafiků i sportovní mobilní aplikaci a 3D anatomii.
Aplikace miomove bude dostupná ve verzi:

<h3><strong>WHY?</strong></h3>
<p>Innovations made complicated tasks accessible to the general public, but this has not happened for biotech and medicine. In 2015 I got malaria in Ghana in and I was diagnosed by a microscope, while more advanced technologies exist. We all have seen that there are not enough skilled experts for testing especially in rural areas. <strong>EDUCATION IS THE KEY! </strong></p>
<p><strong>We developed an educational kit to diagnose infections as (malaria, HIV, TB, COVID, sickle cells, and more)</strong></p>

</div></div>","WHY?
Innovations made complicated tasks accessible to the general public, but this has not happened for biotech and medicine. In 2015 I got malaria in Ghana in and I was diagnosed by a microscope, while more advanced technologies exist. We all have seen that there are not enough skilled experts for testing especially in rural areas. EDUCATION IS THE KEY! 
We developed an educational kit to diagnose infections as (malaria, HIV, TB, COVID, sickle cells, and more)
Warning: Several tests can be run in parallel, but each of them requires a separate probe. 

WHAT?

We provide videolectures focused on rural areas.
An accessible diagnostic kit for a series of infections.
Continuos education.
A GIS for NGOs or for our network to map all positive cases.

with each 100 EUR we will empower one selected lab in Ghana, or you can buy those things for yourself.

The diagnostic kit is based on Loop Isothermal amplification (read the original scientific paper),  which provides results in 20-30 minutes visible by the naked eye without further devices as for PCR. Pink is a negative and yellow is a positive case of whatever disease (malaria, TB, HIV, COVID...).




The geographic information system (GIS) can be used by our individual users creating a network of positive cases, or by NGOs which are using several of our devices within their clinics and they want to have an immediate look of what is happening.
 
HOW?
We aim at supporting 1000 labs in Ghana and west Africa with this initiative and other funding. 
You can donate, or buy a kit for yourself, or at least share on your social media.
If we go beyond the goal, the further funding will finance scholarship to researchers in Ghana.If we reach reasonably less than the limit we will proceed anyway with the project.

The question that brought this about was remarkably simple. Gifty called David to see if he could help find a cordless blender with a stainless-steel insulated cup. Gifty wanted something she could take to the gym or work that would keep her drinks cold for hours. After days of searching, they were unable to find what they wanted. They also realized that the blender market had not changed in decades. All the cool technology now available wasn’t being used.</p><p>After careful thought and consideration, they decided to start Bonsi, Inc. to develop their version of what a blender should be. It needed to integrate all the relevant, current technology to create a powerful, compact, eco-friendly product made with high-quality parts and be easy to use. They knew this would require sacrifice, risk, and months of effort. And they would need to do all of this during a worldwide pandemic and at a time of unprecedented political turmoil. But it had to be done – people deserved a product that would help them live better and simpler lives.</p><p>After months of research, endless phone calls, design work, and putting together the best possible team, Bonsi Blend was born. Like the bonsai tree, Bonsi Blend is small, powerful, sturdy, beautiful, and made to last.</p><p>The patent-pending Bonsi Blend was developed with only the best parts available.</p><ul>
<li>A 25-Volt Bonsi Power Pack, made from the highest quality lithium-ion batteries, delivers 750 watts of peak power. Easily as powerful as a home blender, Bonsi Blend will give you up to 30 blends per charge.</li>
<li>The best slotless, brushless motor gives it a peak efficiency of  85%, creating a quieter blender.</li>
<li>Integrated safety technology ensures that the blades won’t turn without a cup attached and stop if the blender tips over.</li>
<li>A USB-C, PD 3.0-Rapid Charger gives it the fastest possible charging speeds.</li>
<li>Data transfer options allow it to receive remote firmware updates. All you need is a cable to connect the USB-C connector to a computer.</li>
<li>A rugged, flex-rigid PCB board, built to last for years.</li>
<li>A sliding touch sensor to make operating it intuitive, easy, and simple.</li>

Keeping you safe!   Our StoryBonsi, Inc was founded in April of 2020 by David and Gifty Haight to create consumer products to revolutionize their markets. The question that brought this about was remarkably simple. Gifty called David to see if he could help find a cordless blender with a stainless-steel insulated cup. Gifty wanted something she could take to the gym or work that would keep her drinks cold for hours. After days of searching, they were unable to find what they wanted. They also realized that the blender market had not changed in decades. All the cool technology now available wasn’t being used.After careful thought and consideration, they decided to start Bonsi, Inc. to develop their version of what a blender should be. It needed to integrate all the relevant, current technology to create a powerful, compact, eco-friendly product made with high-quality parts and be easy to use. They knew this would require sacrifice, risk, and months of effort. And they would need to do all of this during a worldwide pandemic and at a time of unprecedented political turmoil. But it had to be done – people deserved a product that would help them live better and simpler lives.After months of research, endless phone calls, design work, and putting together the best possible team, Bonsi Blend was born. Like the bonsai tree, Bonsi Blend is small, powerful, sturdy, beautiful, and made to last.The patent-pending Bonsi Blend was developed with only the best parts available.
A 25-Volt Bonsi Power Pack, made from the highest quality lithium-ion batteries, delivers 750 watts of peak power. Easily as powerful as a home blender, Bonsi Blend will give you up to 30 blends per charge.
The best slotless, brushless motor gives it a peak efficiency of  85%, creating a quieter blender.
Integrated safety technology ensures that the blades won’t turn without a cup attached and stop if the blender tips over.
A USB-C, PD 3.0-Rapid Charger gives it the fastest possible charging speeds.
Data transfer options allow it to receive remote firmware updates. All you need is a cable to connect the USB-C connector to a computer.
A rugged, flex-rigid PCB board, built to last for years.
A sliding touch sensor to make operating it intuitive, easy, and simple.
It was purposely built without a plastic blending vessel. Let’s face it; there are enough plastic bottles in the world. Instead, Bonsi Blend attaches to cups already in the market – RTIC® Bottles, Yeti® Bottles, and Hydro Flask® wide-mouth bottles, giving people the choice of brand, color, and bottle size.
As with any new venture, there was a great deal to be endured by everyone involved. With a 3-year-old boy, plus the cost of developing Bonsi Blend, it was not an easy task. David had to travel a lot for work and the development of Bonsi Blend. Gifty worked in the medical field during Covid, picking up extra shifts when she could while raising their son, Nathan.As with anything in life, struggle, determination, and sacrifice are part of what makes something great. Bonsi Blend is an extraordinary product, forged with determination and sacrifice, that will revolutionize how blenders are made. Bonsi shows the world that if you have the will to do something, anything is possible.Gifty and David look forward to sharing Bonsi Blend with the world and sharing the love one blend at a time. StatusFinal stages- of designing the best cordless blender just for you.

</div></div>","If you love to dream and think out of the box then BuzzlePops is for you!  

What we love most about our little flavored alcohol balls is their ability to help people use their creative muscles.  

With all of our unique flavors and tastes there is something for everyone and every drink.  They also go perfect on top of an ice cream sundae or fruity dessert dish.  The options are endless and we cannot wait to see what you do with them when you get your hands on your own BuzzlePops.











We are here to tell you about BuzzlePops.
BuzzlePops adds a different character and dimension to your existing cocktails. But the best part of BuzzlePops is you can use them to add some fun to anything, BuzzlePops allows you to use your imagination when your in the kitchen or the bar!  As you can probably relate, cocktail hour always needs some fun conversation starters.  But a conversation starter that is filled with alcohol is twice as fun. We strongly believe your next dinner party; cocktail event or even dessert will not be complete with out BuzzlePops.
BuzzlePops are small, pop-able balls of 10-14.9% alcohol by vol. With their 9 months shelf life, you will be making your cocktails or other creations special and fun. 







After more than 18 months of working to get the product EU approved, compliant and more importantly delicious, we now have BuzzlePops ready to bring to you. We have worked tirelessly to ensure that every ingredient is naturally sourced. And every aspect complies with all the laws and regulations in Europe.
We already have a few restaurants, bars and distributors interested in bringing this NEW, FUN experience to their venues. We have tested the product and got the supply chain ready for our first orders. Through the crowdfunding campaign, we hope to introduce our creations to you, first.












WE WILL SHIP GLOBALLY. 
This is based on the jurisdiction and local excise and customs. If you order a perk, we will ensure that we will find a way to send over BuzzlePops Jars to you.We prefer if you can make delivery parties, in the key cities we have identified in Europe. At these delivery parties, you will can pick up your BuzzlePops pre-order and get a FREE drink made with BuzzlePops.


If you can't make these parties in the period of March - July 2015 or if we do not hit minimum demand, we have optional delivery available to ship it to you in Europe. 





That’s awesome—but why am I reading this on Indiegogo?The “crowd source” website is our approach to bring BuzzlePops to our growing fanbase and welcome more into our community. We’re offering you unique sneak peak at a special price that is exclusive to this campaign. Direct from us to you. 
Your funding will help us get through the launch phase of our product. These the next steps

...but importantly to help us find and grow our community.
When you add all these factors together - compounded with the miscellaneous costs, the fact that we need to produce enough BuzzlePops in our initial run to carry us for the next 6 months (Estimated break even point). This supports us to bring this product to you and the market.

​How old must I be to Pop ?

You must be 18 years of age in the EU & 21 years of age in the US at the time of purchase. If your country has different rules then we need to abide by the country specific age restrictions.
Can I buy BuzzlePops now if I’m not 18 but will be 18 by 2016?
Again, you must be of legal drinking age AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE.
Can I buy BuzzlePops now if I’m not 18 but am giving it as a gift to someone who is 18?
No.
Just how rare is BuzzlePops?
Pretty damn rare! BuzzlePops has not been launched anywhere in the world and will ONLY be sold initially during the crowd-participation campaign

Even though we possess the biotechnological tools today to bring aging under scientific medical control, very little is done.</p><p>Whats more, the research that is done is almost exclusively conducted by private organisations. The world is already dominated by giant corporations who care about nothing but profits. Making the gap between rich and poor even greater. Do we really want THEM to have the power to control aging and human lifespans? </p><p>The public and the governments don‘t notice that there is already a race happening. It doesn‘t matter if one finds living forever a good or a bad thing, the technology will come. That‘s why we set up the <a href=""http://human-immortality-project.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Human Immortality Project</a>. We aim for a public non-profit approach, transparent, open-source, where society is involved. To make the world a better place for everyone, not just the super-rich.</p><h3>Why the Human Immortality Project (HIP)?</h3><ul>
<li>Abolish the greatest drive of suffering in the world: Aging and its consequential death. The physical hardships that come with (your body decomposing) aging, and the often traumatic grief for loved ones.</li>
<li>Enable humans to explore our beautiful world without a set time-limit.</li>
<li>The HIP approach that we advocate is in public interest. Life extension / rejuvenation technology will arise sooner or later, whether one wants it to or not. In consideration of that fact, there is only one question you need to ask yourself: Who do you want to have the power to control it? As of this moment, the private sector already has a considerable head start, whereas the governments and the public don‘t even know that there is already a race for the leading position. Just one example of this is Google: around 3 years ago they founded <a href=""https://www.calicolabs.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Calicolabs</a>, whose only goal is to »cure aging«. And guess what, they are not telling anyone which methods they are working on or what progress they‘re making.</li>
<li>Enormous economic value. When people stay young and healthy they can continue contributing wealth to society rather then consuming it. It will save literally trillions of dollar in health care expenses.</li>

An international research effort to sequence and map all of the genes - together known as the genome - of members of our species, Homo sapiens. It took almost 20 years to complete and was only possible through  widespread international cooperation.<br/>The project was performed in over twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France and China.</p><p>The same effort is needed now to put an end to aging, at least if desired within a reasonable amount of time. This crowdfunding campaign is intended to be the spark.</p><h3>
<br/>What is aging?</h3><p>A chemical process in our cells, a genetically codified principle.  Aging is not an absolute, it‘s a shapeable relative. Most people wrongly assume aging as something inevitable, but visionary scientists have already proven with experimental research that this isn't the case. <a href=""http://www.human-immortality-project.com/organisms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Several species</a> have been found, who appear to be able to defy the aging process. Unlike humans, many of them don’t die as a result of their own metabolisms - there doesn’t seem to be a built-in life expectancy in their cells. </p><p>In scientific terms, aging is seen as a decline of our cells ability to keep its <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27050288"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">homeostasis</a> (cell maintenance), which leads to the accumulation of damage in our body, ultimately making us sick and die.<br/>Do not mistaken aging with age-related diseases like Alzheimer, heart disease and most types of cancer, those are  merely the symptoms of aging.</p><p> </p><p>Here is a great video that illustrates the subject:</p><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jc4yK0zZ-cQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div><h3>
<br/>Is this really possible?</h3><p>Slowing down the aging process and thereby extending maximum lifespan has already been done to a certain extent in several model organisms. Rejuvenation has also been observed in certain experiments.</p><p><strong>In the matter of life extension, here a few quick examples.</strong></p><p>Scientists managed to extend the lifespan of C. elegans <strong>10-fold</strong>, with a single gene mutation. Fore more information on it, this is the paper:<br/><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23543623"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23543623</a></p><p>Regarding <i>Mus musculus</i> (common mouse), researches managed to <strong>double</strong> its lifespan. There is even a database, where you can see to which extent certain gene alterations affect its maximum lifespan:<br/><a href=""http://genomics.senescence.info/genes/search.php?organism=Mus+musculus&amp;show=4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://genomics.senescence.info/genes/search.ph...</a></p><p><br/><strong>In the matter of rejuvenation:</strong><br/>Transfusing blood from young mice into old ones has a significant rejuvenation-effect, improving their memory, cognition, physical activity and tissue regeneration. And, it also works the other way around. So watch out who you get blood transfusions from!<br/>Here two papers referring to this:<br/><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5121415/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC51...</a><br/><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793238"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793238</a></p><p>Or if that‘s too scientific for you, there is a nice news clip that elaborates on the subject:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNTfjbG14Y?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3>
<br/>Why is the science community not already focusing on it?</h3><p>Having spent months reviewing the current scientific state of the field and in consideration of newly emerged evidence, we can just say »What‘s going on, is a big joke«. </p><p>The biggest issue is, that most research is done on the symptoms of aging: Age-Related Diseases (ARD‘S) .Those conditions are called »age related diseases« for a reason, they don‘t usually occur in young individuals. Now we can conclude without doubt that the root-cause for all of them is aging.<br/>Medical researchers still tend to tackle ARD‘s separately.  After all, the illnesses are distinct: cancer arises from mutated DNA; heart disease from clogged up blood vessels and dementia from damaged brain cells. The biological processes that underpin the pathologies vary vastly and each needs specific treatment. Previously it may have seemed like a good approach for lack of a better alternative, but it is fair to say that the greatest driver of disease in old age is old age.</p><p>Governments, universities and foundations are spending enormous sums on research against age-related diseases. Not to mention the ever increasing healthcare-system costs causing the imminent ""silver tsunami"".<br/>It‘s harsh to say that all this money and effort is/has been wasted. This statement certainly would have been incorrect 10 years ago, but with recent scientific progress and discoveries, the new knowledge needs to be applied and research refocused. In the field of biological aging, this has yet to happen.</p><h3>
<br/>What will happen if we don‘t tackle the aging problem right now?</h3><p>Apart from missing out on humanities bright future, it‘s going to have a catastrophically economic impact for generations to come. By 2020, for the first time in history, the number of people older than 65 will outnumber the number of children younger than 5 years of age.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485213423/nz62mseagto5joo6ovef.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This will have a massive impact on our health-care systems. The <a href=""http://www.human-immortality-project.com/news/silver-tsunami"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">silver tsunami</a> is coming and it will affect us all. It's not going to happen in the far future, but over the next few decades. Of course eventually this demographic transition will be over and population proportions balanced again. But it‘s certain that we the people alive today, will have to struggle through that phase,  rendering hundreds of thousands elderly and their families destitute.</p><p><br/><strong>What is the silver tsunami?</strong></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8LJqt6fj8uI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>Why should i support this project?</h3><p>Two reasons. You like living and want this upcoming medical technology to be available to everyone, not just the super-rich.</p><p>Since we are a registered public non-profit organization (HIRA Human Immortality Research Association gUG) we are constrained by law to use all raised money only for intended purposes written in our associations terms of reference, which you can read further below.</p><p>Governments are the ones who control the majority of funds going into research, so one of our main goals is to convince them to get involved in such a undertaking. Not only by showing them the enormous economic benefits, but also by pointing out the <strong>moral obligation</strong> towards it. We as a society are trying our best to fight causes of suffering, like malaria, terrorism, hunger, but the most obvious one, affecting each single one of us, is severely neglected.  To not act when we possess the tools to fight would be amoral.</p><p>This initiative aims to be a <strong>wake-up call</strong> to society and governments around the world to take action. We, the people, have to speak up for what we think is right. Once the ball gets rolling, it‘ll create a momentum all of its own. </p><p>We set up this crowdfunding campaign to gauge the general publics interest in healthy life extension and rejuvenation. No matter the outcome, we will pursue solving the aging-problem, as it is one of the world‘s most pressing issues </p><p><strong>How much of a difference does your donation make?</strong></p><p>More than 100.000 people die of aging every single day. Let‘s say that a donation of $1 accelerates the completion of the Human Immortality Project for only 1 second. With one day having 86.400 seconds that means that each Dollar donated will save 1,15 lives, so roughly one life per Dollar. Just think about it! Each Dollar you donate will save one life in the future.</p><h3>
<br/>What will we do with certain amounts raised.</h3><p>5 million sounds like a lot? If 1 million people each give 5$ we‘re there. 5$ is very little considering what we would achieve, but reaching 2 million people is difficult, so spread the word!<br/>Still, we have a flexible funding goal, depending on how much money we raise, will determine our next steps and how fast this movement will grow.</p><p>(Reaching a higher target will include key goals of lower targets.)</p><p><strong>Up to USD 100.000-500.000</strong><br/>Convince governments in political and public debate, creation of petitions.<br/>-Support for existing research efforts and projects of selected non-profit organisations listed here @ <a href=""http://www.human-immortality-project.com/the-plan/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.human-immortality-project.com/the-plan/</a></p><p><br/><strong>USD  500.000</strong> <br/>Create a platform designated to foster collaboration where scientists can systematically work together on the different research approaches</p><p><strong>USD 1 mio</strong><br/>This is enough money to dedicate our full time and lives for the next years to get the Human Immortality Project well underway.

<br/>The science of aging.</h3><p>If you are interested in learning more about the scientific aspects and want to know more about the science of aging, please continue reading.</p><p>Aging is seen as a progressive failure of homeodynamics–systemic preservation of homeostasis, involving genes for maintenance and repair, stochastic events leading to molecular damage and molecular heterogeneity, and chance events determining the probability of death. Since complex and interacting systems of maintenance and repair comprise the homeodynamic space of a biological system, aging is considered to be a progressive shrinkage of homeodynamic space mainly due to increased molecular heterogeneity.In 2010, a group of scientists defined nine hallmarks of aging that are common between organisms with emphasis on mammals: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered inter-cellular communication.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486483435/xadhtoeq229vrv3oniqs.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Source: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC38..."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Hallmarks of Aging</a></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","What is the Human Immortality Project?Now, for the first time in human history, we have the means to defeat the aging process.

Unlike humans, many of them don’t die as a result of their own metabolisms - there doesn’t seem to be a built-in life expectancy in their cells. In scientific terms, aging is seen as a decline of our cells ability to keep its homeostasis (cell maintenance), which leads to the accumulation of damage in our body, ultimately making us sick and die.Do not mistaken aging with age-related diseases like Alzheimer, heart disease and most types of cancer, those are  merely the symptoms of aging. Here is a great video that illustrates the subject:

 

Is this really possible?Slowing down the aging process and thereby extending maximum lifespan has already been done to a certain extent in several model organisms. Rejuvenation has also been observed in certain experiments.In the matter of life extension, here a few quick examples.Scientists managed to extend the lifespan of C. elegans 10-fold, with a single gene mutation. Fore more information on it, this is the paper:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23543623Regarding Mus musculus (common mouse), researches managed to double its lifespan. There is even a database, where you can see to which extent certain gene alterations affect its maximum lifespan:http://genomics.senescence.info/genes/search.ph...In the matter of rejuvenation:Transfusing blood from young mice into old ones has a significant rejuvenation-effect, improving their memory, cognition, physical activity and tissue regeneration. And, it also works the other way around. So watch out who you get blood transfusions from!Here two papers referring to this:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC51...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24793238Or if that‘s too scientific for you, there is a nice news clip that elaborates on the subject:
Why is the science community not already focusing on it?Having spent months reviewing the current scientific state of the field and in consideration of newly emerged evidence, we can just say »What‘s going on, is a big joke«. The biggest issue is, that most research is done on the symptoms of aging: Age-Related Diseases (ARD‘S) .Those conditions are called »age related diseases« for a reason, they don‘t usually occur in young individuals. Now we can conclude without doubt that the root-cause for all of them is aging.Medical researchers still tend to tackle ARD‘s separately.  After all, the illnesses are distinct: cancer arises from mutated DNA; heart disease from clogged up blood vessels and dementia from damaged brain cells. The biological processes that underpin the pathologies vary vastly and each needs specific treatment. Previously it may have seemed like a good approach for lack of a better alternative, but it is fair to say that the greatest driver of disease in old age is old age.Governments, universities and foundations are spending enormous sums on research against age-related diseases. Not to mention the ever increasing healthcare-system costs causing the imminent ""silver tsunami"".It‘s harsh to say that all this money and effort is/has been wasted. This statement certainly would have been incorrect 10 years ago, but with recent scientific progress and discoveries, the new knowledge needs to be applied and research refocused. In the field of biological aging, this has yet to happen.
What will happen if we don‘t tackle the aging problem right now?Apart from missing out on humanities bright future, it‘s going to have a catastrophically economic impact for generations to come. By 2020, for the first time in history, the number of people older than 65 will outnumber the number of children younger than 5 years of age.This will have a massive impact on our health-care systems. The silver tsunami is coming and it will affect us all. It's not going to happen in the far future, but over the next few decades. Of course eventually this demographic transition will be over and population proportions balanced again. But it‘s certain that we the people alive today, will have to struggle through that phase,  rendering hundreds of thousands elderly and their families destitute.What is the silver tsunami? Why should i support this project?Two reasons. You like living and want this upcoming medical technology to be available to everyone, not just the super-rich.Since we are a registered public non-profit organization (HIRA Human Immortality Research Association gUG) we are constrained by law to use all raised money only for intended purposes written in our associations terms of reference, which you can read further below.Governments are the ones who control the majority of funds going into research, so one of our main goals is to convince them to get involved in such a undertaking. Not only by showing them the enormous economic benefits, but also by pointing out the moral obligation towards it. We as a society are trying our best to fight causes of suffering, like malaria, terrorism, hunger, but the most obvious one, affecting each single one of us, is severely neglected.  To not act when we possess the tools to fight would be amoral.This initiative aims to be a wake-up call to society and governments around the world to take action. We, the people, have to speak up for what we think is right. Once the ball gets rolling, it‘ll create a momentum all of its own. We set up this crowdfunding campaign to gauge the general publics interest in healthy life extension and rejuvenation. No matter the outcome, we will pursue solving the aging-problem, as it is one of the world‘s most pressing issues How much of a difference does your donation make?More than 100.000 people die of aging every single day. Let‘s say that a donation of $1 accelerates the completion of the Human Immortality Project for only 1 second. With one day having 86.400 seconds that means that each Dollar donated will save 1,15 lives, so roughly one life per Dollar. Just think about it! Each Dollar you donate will save one life in the future.
What will we do with certain amounts raised.5 million sounds like a lot? If 1 million people each give 5$ we‘re there. 5$ is very little considering what we would achieve, but reaching 2 million people is difficult, so spread the word!Still, we have a flexible funding goal, depending on how much money we raise, will determine our next steps and how fast this movement will grow.(Reaching a higher target will include key goals of lower targets.)Up to USD 100.000-500.000Convince governments in political and public debate, creation of petitions.-Support for existing research efforts and projects of selected non-profit organisations listed here @ http://www.human-immortality-project.com/the-plan/USD  500.000 Create a platform designated to foster collaboration where scientists can systematically work together on the different research approachesUSD 1 mioThis is enough money to dedicate our full time and lives for the next years to get the Human Immortality Project well underway. We will convince the governments of its necessity, we will persuade charitable investors to get on board, we will not rest until we become biologically immortal, or we will die trying.Aside from that.Looking for more genetic hints in naturally long-lived animals by appointing specific research assignments to independent researchers. The subjects of particular interest can be seen on our homepage @ http://www.human-immortality-project.com/organismsUSD 3 mioDeeper analysis of specific age related mechanisms on a cellular level by appointing specific research assignments to independent researchers. The subjects of particular interest can be seen on our homepage @ http://www.human-immortality-project.com/cellul...)USD 5 miowill give us the opportunity to set up our own laboratory to get completely new research programs underway. Human Immortality Research Institute (in collaboration with another non-profit/university)USD 10 mioIndependet InstituteThis is still not nearly enough to do all the necessary aging-research, but it will give the movement a big momentum and signal the political leaders (who control most money spent on research), that there is a desire for this to happen.5 billionCongratulations. This is enough money to do all relevant aging- research for the next few decades. Even if you didn't donate, your life will still be rescued.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This campaign is also supposed to be a wake-up call for society and for the worlds leaders, not only to communicate that this project is feasible , but a necessity. The research that needs to be done is too much for any sole organisation (at least within a reasonable amount of time),  Associations terms of reference; 2.c)  The objects of the organization consist in:The association pursues exclusively and directly charitable purposes as defined by section »tax-privileged purposes« of the general tax code. The purpose of the organisation is the advancement of science, particularly basic and methodological research in the natural sciences. First of all in the fields of biology and chemistry, which are associated with the aging processes of living organisms (gerontology). The biochemical background of aging and its symptoms shall be studied and decoded, to enable humans a longer life in a healthy state. The institute is in its research activity free and independent. All research findings will be promptly made accessible to the public. ConcernsWe understand that the subject itself raises many concerns about overpopulation, change of society, etc. There is of course some truth in all concerns, but by analyzing each one of them it turns out that they are not as worrisome as at first thought (we discuss all of them here: http://www.human-immortality-project.com/concerns/). The topic that emerges always first is the one about overpopulation. We found an excellent video that elaborates the issue: As you read this you may think, no there are many good valid reasons not to pursue immortality, like overpopulation, unsuitability, dictators living forever, access only to the wealthy, unnaturalness, change of society... These are all hasty and unreflected arguments your mind produces in distress, due to the fact that one of the pillars your reality is built on is being threatened. It is an automated psychological response.  If you made it this far and are still in doubt, see the »Concerns« section on our website, where each of your concerns will be addressed. Beyond money— we need your help spreading the wordAt its heart, the Human Immortality Project is a grassroots movement of biologists and charitable entrepreneurs who wish to enrich the human experience and make the world a healthier place for everyone. Whether you donate to our campaign or not, you can still help make history. Anyone, anywhere can raise awareness about the subject
The science of aging.If you are interested in learning more about the scientific aspects and want to know more about the science of aging, please continue reading.Aging is seen as a progressive failure of homeodynamics–systemic preservation of homeostasis, involving genes for maintenance and repair, stochastic events leading to molecular damage and molecular heterogeneity, and chance events determining the probability of death. Since complex and interacting systems of maintenance and repair comprise the homeodynamic space of a biological system, aging is considered to be a progressive shrinkage of homeodynamic space mainly due to increased molecular heterogeneity.In 2010, a group of scientists defined nine hallmarks of aging that are common between organisms with emphasis on mammals: genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered inter-cellular communication. Source: The Hallmarks of Aging",3.0,4,"1 Campaign

As children, my mother and her siblings spent a lot of time on my great-grandparents farm in a tiny town in Central Kentucky called Summer Shade. They played in the fields, explored the neighboring small town, visited the country store with a big, black potbelly stove in the middle of it, and enjoyed all that small farm life, family and nature had to offer. Our company's name was inspired by those memories of family, drawn from the purity and simplicity of nature.</p><h3><i>Visit our website at <a href=""http://www.summershade.life"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.summershade.life</a> and use the code ""Indiegogo"" to save 10% on your first online order.</i></h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496230707/gtnejlsyh8kh6o1qwdxl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Follow us on     <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/summershadeapothecary"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>  |    <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/summershadeapothecary"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a>   |    <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/summershadeapot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>    |     <a href=""http://www.pinterest.com/summershadeapothecary"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pinterest</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>We're growing fast...and so is the demand for healthier, more sustainable lifestyles.</i></strong></h2><p>Brands manufacturing and selling sustainable products have seen <a href=""https://www.marketingweek.com/2017/05/18/unilever-sustainable-brands-growth/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>significant growth</u></a> in the last decade and Summer Shade Holistic Apothecary is no exception. But to meet the demands of our environmentally savvy consumers we must expand our manufacturing facilities and hire staff. To do this we need your help.</p><p><strong>Our flexible IndieGoGo goal of $75,000 will cover <i>Phase One</i> of our strategic plan for our company growth. We've kept this goal flexible so that we can begin implementing our growth strategy's early stages and report to our funders on our progress in real time as the fund grows.</strong> <strong>This is how the money will be spent:</strong></p><p>1) <strong>Hire employees</strong> - Our hiring efforts will focus on marginalized groups that tend to be overlooked in the traditional job market. This includes mentally or physically challenged adults, women attempting to get out of the adult entertainment industry, veterans and legal refugees looking to provide for their families, as well as practice a new language and acquire job skills.</p><p>2) <strong>Purchase ingredients in larger bulk quantities</strong> - This will help us meet demands for product and save money long-term because the cost per unit decreases with larger bulk orders of ingredients and packaging. This will also cut down on carbon emissions by eliminating multiples deliveries every month</p><p>3) <strong>Equipment purchases</strong> - All of our products are crafted by hand using simple tools and equipment. While we will continue to craft recipes and products by hand, some steps in the manufacturing process are unnecessarily slowed by the limitations of our existing equipment. Funding for equipment to streamline packaging, such as a label printer will help us become more efficient. It will also allow us to manufacture soaps and other products faster and more while maintaining the same level of superior quality and implementing a manufacturing standard at the highest level.</p><p>4) <strong>Acquiring a manufacturing space outside of our home, along with a storefront that customers can visit to purchase products</strong> - We need a space that can accommodate our lifestyle brand, including manufacturing, a classroom, a storefront, a small studio to film educational YouTube videos, a space for shipping and receiving, an office and storage for ingredients and inventory. This space must be located on a bus line for employees who are unable to drive. The fund would also support build out costs, including rehabbing or making changes to a neglected space or plot of land to fit our business needs.</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Coming soon...</i></h2><p> </p><p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495638033/ankcekh6j7tb0hmhts2d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Phase Two</strong> of our growth strategy will be to purchase land in an underserved community in Louisville, Kentucky. Louisville has been recognized internationally as a Model Compassionate City and we at Summer Shade Holistic Apothecary will work to continue that legacy of compassion in our business and in our city. We will use this land to develop a small organic, urban farm where will grow our own herbs and other crops, as well as raise goats to produce goat milk beauty products and cheeses, yogurt and kefir. We will keep free range chickens to offer our community farm fresh, organic eggs as well as beehives from <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/flow-hive-honey-on-tap-directly-from-your-beehive-environment--5/x/16113673#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Flow Hives</u> </a>(Indiegogo's largest funded company to date) to offer raw, organic honey for use in our own products and for our customers to purchase.

</ul><p>Thank you for being part of the solution with Summer Shade Holistic Apothecary. </p></div>","If you had a chance to change the world, would you? That’s exactly what we are trying to do with our line of soaps, skin care, cleaning products and now with our full holistic apothecary.We are much more than a soap company, we are building an alternative for families and individuals looking to improve their well-being with products that are crafted with passion in support of sustainable, conscious lifestyles around the world.   We WILL be your one-stop shop for all things holistic and eco-friendly. In addition to our own products, we are partnering with other like-minded companies: EcoEnclose, Full Circle, Flip & Tumble, BioBags, Bee's Wraps and others to offer a complete collection of eco-friendly products for you and your home. We are a part of a global community dedicated to building a more sustainable world with consumable products that are earth, animal and human-friendly.Read on to learn more about the different ways Summer Shade Holistic Apothecary is contributing to our local and global communities.              Our products are more than just the label...but that is important too...Pick up any cosmetic or cleaning product at your local store. Turn it over and read the label. How many ingredients do you recognize?In the United States, an average person is exposed to hundreds of unregulated and untested chemicals before they leave the house every morning. These chemicals are often included as ingredients in personal care, cleaning and laundry products that have trusted brand names, even though many of them have been linked to rising rates of certain types of cancer, autism, respiratory problems, and reproductive issues. Many of the products containing these ingredients have already been banned in Europe, but not in the U.S.A. This is largely due to differences in the way policies are made in the United States versus many European nations, but may also have something to do with the lack of public awareness of the harmful effects of these chemicals and the variety of places they can be found in our homes.  Products that claim to be free of harmful additives are available in major stores. However, rules surrounding labels that claim ""organic"" and ""natural"" are vague, which makes it easy for companies to use misleading marketing or misinformation to meet their bottom line. The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recognize a legal definition of organic in cosmetic manufacturing, although the USDA does have stringent regulations on agricultural ingredients that use the term. The same lack of regulation of the word ""natural"" on a label is often a boon for major cosmetic manufacturers seeking to market new products to a health-conscious public. However, as long as a product is free of synthetics and dyes it may be labeled ""natural,"" even if naturally occurring harmful or harsh ingredients are present. Many companies use these terms to justify higher prices to a growing demographic of environmentally savvy consumers while avoiding the cost of improving ingredients and manufacturing processes.                              It is not just the health of an individual that is affected by these harmful additives, the environment also suffers when toxic consumable products are introduced into water systems and ground soil, and non-biodegradable packing sits in landfills.We solve this problem with superior, environmentally friendly products at affordable prices.No longer do we accept at face value that everything in a store is safe simply because it made it past government agencies. We are starting to flip over the bottles and boxes of the foods that we consume and the things we clean our homes with, and the personal care products that we use to scrub our teeth and slather on our armpits and say ""I think there's a better way to do this."" The companies that are keeping up with this trend to be more conscious are thriving. Summer Shade Holistic Apothecary is a total wellness company. Wellness means you stay above the line of disease by making conscious choices every day that contribute to your health and happiness.                                                      Summer Shade products are handcrafted, natural, mainly vegan, palm-free, soy-free, GMO-free, sustainable and eco-friendly. The harvesting of palms is destroying our rainforests, contributing to global warming and killing Orangutan populations.We do not use soy products to help limit exposure to GMOs. Every ingredient has been chosen for its quality, purity and gentle, health-giving natural properties.      Since we produced our first bar of soap in 2013, we've grown beyond our wildest dreams. We now not only craft soap, but also cleaning products, skin care products, healing salves and the list keeps growing as satisfied customers make suggestions for new products and we diversify our inventory. All of our products are of superior quality and most cost less than $15 because healthy alternatives should be affordable for everyone.  We want to use our small business success to bring quality not just to a person's soap dish but to his or her life. That is why we've recently rebranded our company from Summer Shade Soap Company to Summer Shade Holistic Apothecary. In addition to our skin care and cleaning products, we will give families and individuals an affordable alternative to removing toxins from their life with a variety of wellness and eco-friendly products, including tinctures, elixirs, balms, tea blends, salves, essential oils, diffusers and accessories for your home through partnerships with earth-conscious companies that manufacture superior household products.Our vision - A healthier life, a healthier world                                     Summer Shade Holistic Apothecary is dedicated to improving the community where we live, work and love, as well as contributing to sustainable living around the world. Our approach to business is as holistic as the products we sell. This means that every stage of our growth will include outreach and community involvement. We want to improve the lives of people and contribute to efforts to protect and restore the environment.We will be donating one percent of our gross annual profits to 1% For The Planet, which supports organizations combatting global warming. Yes, our packing and products are biodegradable and most are even compostable, but it's not just about limiting waste for us, it's about leaving the world a better place by giving back.As of July, we will be a Certified B-Corp and our legal structure will be registered as a Benefits Corporation in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. B-Corps are businesses that are committed to solving environmental and social issues around the globe. B-Corps do this in a number of ways, including supporting legislation and leading movements. We're thrilled that our performance history as a company has earned us a place on a roster of successful and well-respected socially-conscious businesses, such as Patagonia and Etsy.        We're dedicated to the Community  While we are committed to making the world a better place, we are also dedicated to the health of our own community. We will be partnering with some amazing organizations in Louisville, Kentucky to provide employment and job skill training to marginalized groups such as wounded veterans, legal refugees, women attempting to get out of the adult entertainment industry and mentally or physically challenged adults.

<div>Joomla is an award-winning content management system (CMS), which enables you to build Web sites and powerful online applications. Many aspects, including its ease-of-use and extensibility, have made Joomla the most popular Web site software available.</div>
<div>Currently, Joomla powers millions of websites including hundred thousands of online stores.</div>
<h2>What is Odoo?</h2>
<div>Odoo, formerly known as OpenERP,  is a comprehensive suite of integrated business applications that are elegantly programmed and customized to manage numerous companies and versatile businesses internationally. Currently, it has<span style=""background-color: initial;""> over 4000 internationally accredited business apps such as CRM, Sales Management, HR, Procurement, Warehouse Management, Accounting &amp; Financial, Project Management, Website Builder, e-Commercial Platform among other applications developed specifically for use by every department of a business related company/organisation.</span>
</div>
<div>In addition to the traditional on-premise deployment, Odoo users have another choice to get Odoo deployed on the cloud with either <a href=""https://www.erponline.vn/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ERPOnline.vn</a> or <a href=""https://www.odoo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Odoo.com</a>
</div> <h2>The problems</h2>
<div>Hundred thousand companies prefer Joomla to power their corporate websites &amp; online stores while Odoo to be their business management solution because of its ERP power.</div>
<div>Currently they have no way to make both platform to talk to each other which causes a lot of problem and difficulty to synchronize their data. For instance, when someone places an order on a Joomla-based store, the company has to manually input sales order data, invoice data, payment data, shipping information, etc into their Odoo system for sales management, warehouse management, invoice &amp; payment control, etc. This is a really pain process with lots of human errors.</div>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<div>By using Joomla Odoo Connectors, which are separate sets of several Joomla extensions and Odoo apps to power the seamless communication between Joomla-based applications and the management hub Odoo over <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">XML-RPC</a>, companies don't have to manually export data from the Joomla(s) and manually import the data into Odoo any more. Everything will be done automatically in real-time. Odoo workflows can be activated automatically based on triggers raised by the Joomla(s). Business processes run more smoothly without any delay.</div>
<div>Upon release, the solution will come with several packages as described below:</div>
<h3>1. Standard Connector</h3>
<div>The Standard Connector package including a Joomla component and several Joomla plugins and an Odoo App to help migrate and synchronize Joomla Users and Joomla Content Articles (powered by the Joomla core com_content) and Joomla K2 Content Items between multiple Joomla-based websites and the central Odoo system.</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435053624/lci7z40rdvbnkrxo4nsq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<h3>2. Standard Online Store Connectors</h3>
<div>The Online Store Connectors are software packages to be developed and created during the first stage of the project that synchronizes data from top 7 Joomla-based e-commerce and shopping cart solutions to Odoo.</div>
<div>The data to synchronize includes, but not limited to, customers data, product data, sales orders data, invoices data, payments data, inventory &amp; stock data. Some of those solutions may support more than that (e.g. coupon system, shipping method, etc), such supported functionalities will be integrated with Odoo too.</div>
<div>At the first stage, the project will support Top 7 solutions as below. Later (in 2016), the project will be expanded to support others such as DigiStore, T-Download Store, PayPlan, MyMuse, etc.</div>

<h2>Helping make Joomla Odoo Connectors a reality</h2>
<p>We need your help in making all this happen. This crowd-funding campaign will allow our developers and UX designers to work full time on making Joomla Odoo Connectors a success.</p>
<p>Our first step towards making the Joomla Odoo Connectors vision a reality is creating and releasing the central core component upon which connectors and integrators and migrators will be built. That includes the engine for models mapping between Joomla and Odoo, the trigger system, the cron system, XML-RPC layer, the app API and the essential email notification functionality.</p>
<p>From there, we go on to add the Standard Connector and the Online Store Connectors. Other kinds of Joomla and Odoo integration will be added in the near future from there too. Then, people can benefit by the power of Joomla and Odoo integration at lower cost with no effort.</p>

Joomla is an award-winning content management system (CMS), which enables you to build Web sites and powerful online applications. Many aspects, including its ease-of-use and extensibility, have made Joomla the most popular Web site software available.
Currently, Joomla powers millions of websites including hundred thousands of online stores.
What is Odoo?
Odoo, formerly known as OpenERP,  is a comprehensive suite of integrated business applications that are elegantly programmed and customized to manage numerous companies and versatile businesses internationally. Currently, it has over 4000 internationally accredited business apps such as CRM, Sales Management, HR, Procurement, Warehouse Management, Accounting & Financial, Project Management, Website Builder, e-Commercial Platform among other applications developed specifically for use by every department of a business related company/organisation.

In addition to the traditional on-premise deployment, Odoo users have another choice to get Odoo deployed on the cloud with either ERPOnline.vn or Odoo.com
 The problems
Hundred thousand companies prefer Joomla to power their corporate websites & online stores while Odoo to be their business management solution because of its ERP power.
Currently they have no way to make both platform to talk to each other which causes a lot of problem and difficulty to synchronize their data. For instance, when someone places an order on a Joomla-based store, the company has to manually input sales order data, invoice data, payment data, shipping information, etc into their Odoo system for sales management, warehouse management, invoice & payment control, etc. This is a really pain process with lots of human errors.
The solution
By using Joomla Odoo Connectors, which are separate sets of several Joomla extensions and Odoo apps to power the seamless communication between Joomla-based applications and the management hub Odoo over XML-RPC, companies don't have to manually export data from the Joomla(s) and manually import the data into Odoo any more. Everything will be done automatically in real-time. Odoo workflows can be activated automatically based on triggers raised by the Joomla(s). Business processes run more smoothly without any delay.
Upon release, the solution will come with several packages as described below:
1. Standard Connector
The Standard Connector package including a Joomla component and several Joomla plugins and an Odoo App to help migrate and synchronize Joomla Users and Joomla Content Articles (powered by the Joomla core com_content) and Joomla K2 Content Items between multiple Joomla-based websites and the central Odoo system.

2. Standard Online Store Connectors
The Online Store Connectors are software packages to be developed and created during the first stage of the project that synchronizes data from top 7 Joomla-based e-commerce and shopping cart solutions to Odoo.
The data to synchronize includes, but not limited to, customers data, product data, sales orders data, invoices data, payments data, inventory & stock data. Some of those solutions may support more than that (e.g. coupon system, shipping method, etc), such supported functionalities will be integrated with Odoo too.
At the first stage, the project will support Top 7 solutions as below. Later (in 2016), the project will be expanded to support others such as DigiStore, T-Download Store, PayPlan, MyMuse, etc.

Our first step towards making the Joomla Odoo Connectors vision a reality is creating and releasing the central core component upon which connectors and integrators and migrators will be built. That includes the engine for models mapping between Joomla and Odoo, the trigger system, the cron system, XML-RPC layer, the app API and the essential email notification functionality.
From there, we go on to add the Standard Connector and the Online Store Connectors. Other kinds of Joomla and Odoo integration will be added in the near future from there too. Then, people can benefit by the power of Joomla and Odoo integration at lower cost with no effort.
When we reach our initial goal with your help then we will start the project immediately as scheduled by the Estimated Timeline above.

<p>Imagine your life:</p>
<p>You study hard all your childhood, every weekend. Then 40+
years you work hard to provide yourself a roof, protection to your family,
everything you have to your children. You have a happy life. Then your
retirement comes and… you still have to work and even more harder. You are
lucky if you get clean and easy job, but what if you will end up in hawker center?
What if you will have to clean tables and pick up dirty dishes <b>all day long</b>? You can’t walk fast any
more, but you go in circles to pick up that dirty plate and bring it to the
cleaning counter. At night your legs hurts so bad, you barely can walk home.
And next day it’s the same, weekends too…</p>
<p><b>Do you want this kind of life? Do you deserve it? Do they
deserve?..</b></p>
<p>I live in Singapore almost 1.5 years and since very
beginning one thing really stroked me that mostly just old people are taking
care of dirty tables in the food courts. Most of them move slow and never
smile. Rarely I heard people thanking them for cleaning their tables, uncommon
was to see people bringing their dirty plates to the cleaning counter
themselves. </p>
<p><b>Singapore is a great country! </b>I wish to live here for many
years. When my friends come to visit, I am proudly taking them around and
honestly praise this country. I never complain about Singapore, but one fact I
always have to share, coz I simply don’t understand it – why elderly
Singaporeans are not cared off? I am so surprised that such a rich and smart country
doesn’t have the system that works for all in pension age. I understand that it’s
not so easy, but it’s very hard to see how these super old uncles and aunties
have to suffer at the age when they should rest and felt cared off. They
deserve it, because they did so all their life for others.</p>
<p>So my question is: <b>can we do something about it? </b>We all
aware of it, but why do we all keep silent?</p>
<p><b>Dream here is</b> not only to collect money and spread it
through ageing community (maybe helping them to move from full time to part
time job?), but most importantly there must be a clear action plan. If we will
acknowledge this problem, maybe coming election could be a great way to start
solving it?</p>
<p>If you agree to this idea, at least you could do, it’s <b>share</b>. If
you have any suggestions – please share too! All collected money will go to elderly. The way how we will do it depends on how much we will collect, but all ideas are very welcome in the comments' area.</p>
<p>Would you stand up for your parents? If so, let’s stand up
for your neighbour, your community, Singapore!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hands Free Back Wash: Stay Independent In The Shower</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Taking a hot shower feels fantastic. You can’t help but feel more relaxed when you get out. But for the disabled and the elderly, getting clean in the shower can be a challenge.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I’ve seen the need for a Hands Free Back Wash throughout my 24-year career as a registered nurse. Then last year, it hit closer to home when my oldest daughter was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She called me in a panic one morning when she wasn’t able to lift her arms.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Throughout most of our lives, a shower is a private experience. It’s easy to become depressed when we need help to do what seems so simple. The Hands Free Back Wash allows everyone to maintain their dignity, while also turning a simple shower into a spa-like experience.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How It Works</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586208773/qjwzwiqvwewxtyl81klf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Each unit attaches to a shower with industrial-grade suction cups. The front has three rotating silicone brushes that dispense soap. It has a reservoir that holds 16 oz. or more of body wash, so you won’t need to refill it often. The brushes follow three vertical tracks that use motors to move them up and down, enhancing their therapeutic effect of reducing strains, muscle soreness and improving circulation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And depending on your preferences, the brush heads can be switched for other styles that, for example, may be designed more for scrubbing or massaging (and different speeds such as low, medium or high).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The motors that spin the brushes are powered by a rechargeable battery unit with a sealed compartment that can easily be accessed without removing the device from the wall.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">After pressing a button to start the scrubbing action and selecting the brush speed you prefer, all that’s required is to press your back against the Hands Free Back Wash so it can work its magic!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who Needs This In Their Shower?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">EVERYONE can benefit from a Hands Free Back Wash! It is extremely beneficial for anyone with upper extremity limitations, including people managing the following conditions: Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, sciatica, herniated disks, any degenerative disk disease, stroke, heart attack, tendinitis, rotator cuff injuries, severe back acne due to profuse sweating, and people with physical disabilities. Many veterans who return from war zones with injuries also want to maintain their independence, which makes the Hands Free Back Wash a good solution for them, too.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Not Just Use a Loofah With A Handle?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If you look at the conditions listed above, many people are not able to reach their backs and apply the pressure needed to clean them with a sponge or loofah, even when they’re attached to a handle. Another problem with these tools is they can spread bacteria. Few people disinfect them after each use, which means they are breeding grounds for germs. When you shower, the steam causes the pores in your skin to open. Rubbing a bacteria-filled loofah on your back increases your chances of getting an infection.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Showering Independently Matters</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">No matter what age you are, we all want to be independent. After a lifetime of doing things on our own, no one wants a nurse or family member assisting them in the shower. And I think we can all agree, we don’t want strangers looking at us in the shower, either. Staying independent reduces depression and keeps us from feeling helpless or like we’re a burden on others.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Never Drop The Soap Again</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It seems like no shower ever made has enough shelving to hold all of our soap, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash, detangler and everything else that needs a space. A lot of people rely on shower caddies that hang from the shower head, but they often slip off causing bottles to fall and even injuries. They also place stress on the show head, which can cause leaks to start. A better solution is to just pour your favorite body wash into the Hands Free Back Wash reservoir and let the scrubbers clean and massage your back.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Silicone Scrubbers Simultaneously Massage And Clean</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The traditional way to clean your back in the shower relies on applying soap to a washcloth, then awkwardly reaching around your sides and shoulders to scrub your back. Even for the most flexible among us, it’s not an easy task. It’s even more annoying when you forget your washcloth and don’t remember until you’re already under the water.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Now think about this scenario: You get in the shower, then push the button on the Hands Free Back Wash to make the scrubbers start to spin. The scent of your favorite body wash immediately fills the shower as it starts being released. You then lean your back harder and softer against the bristles to get your back clean and massaged at the same time. If you have any muscle soreness, you can lean a little harder in those spots to work out the tension.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It’s a much better experience than trying to guess which fingers can reach the center of your back—and it’s the only way if you have mobility problems.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How To Install It</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Each unit relies on industrial-grade suction cups to keep it attached to the wall of a shower. Before installing it, be sure to first clean where it will be placed. This ensures you get the best grip, since dried soap deposits can cause problems. Next, stand in the shower barefoot and hold the device so that the bottom is just above your belly button. That’s about the right height for most people, but it’s possible you may like yours a little higher. Then, make the suction cups damp with some water and press the device against the wall of the shower.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What’s In The Box</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You’ll receive illustrated instructions for installation and usage, the complete Hands Free Back Wash device, 3 silicone scrubbers, one rechargeable battery, and my deepest gratitude for your support.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why I Need Support Now</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I started the process of making the Hands Free Back Wash in October 2018. Since then, I started the preliminary patent research and independent research to see if there were any other products like it on the market—there aren’t. I also had a design firm create full schematics for the device, including renderings of its shape, the motor design, suction cups, and the silicone brushes.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Everything is ready for the first units to be made, but I need funding to pay for manufacturing, packaging and shipping.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Based on the costs to move this from a design to customer doors, the retail price will be $199.95. I’m offering Indiegogo supporters 15% off the retail price, which is a savings of $29.99, for a total discounted price here of $169.95.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Anyone who purchases two products will get 25% off the retail price, for a savings of $49.99 on each unit.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Thomas Johnston, I need your help in getting the funds required to get this new and innovative product ordered and shipped to my business so that I can get it packaged and sent out to the market and start helping people and making money.  I do have a patent pending on the product, the prototype is already made up and I have quotes on what it takes to get the products here.  I even have a list of businesses that I have to take it to when I get the package completed so they can see it and make a decision on carrying it in their stores.  I really hope to hear from you on this, thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>
<p>Lets face it, in this time of COVID-19 we could all use something that will keep us from using our fingers to clean out our noses so we have the best chance at not catching it or any other nasal infection.  What if I asked you to tell me the last 5 things you touched, better yet the first 5 things you touched since washing your hands?  When was the last time you got soap under your fingernails to clean them?  This product should really cut down on the number of sinus infections and other infections that people get through their nose.  With the placement of the scented ends it will help you breathe better, sleep better, and be more productive.  Once you take the scraper end of the pick and clean out the boogers, pollen, and other materials foreign and domestic, you simply turn it around and use the scented end of the pick to breathe in the scent that you have selected. Imagine waking up in the morning and cleaning your nose out with one of the picks and then releasing a scent that helps wake you up and get that nice cold rush of air. It is such a great feeling when you can breathe better, and using these cleaning picks a little bit before bedtime will also help with breathing at night. Each package contains 10 nose picks, so it is convenient for families.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have made sure that I have quotes from a domestic supplier and a foreign supplier, just in case somebody has a production problem, I will have another source so we can keep moving.</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif;letter-spacing: normal;"">Mist water collected on California's coastal hillsides <b>originates in the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean</b> that are located far upwind from populated coastal areas. Unique climatic conditions created by the cold ocean and warm land produce a marine layer that moves to and from coastal areas on the prevailing winds. We catch this fog water as it moves past the coastal hills and cliffs from the ocean.</p>

<br/><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif;letter-spacing: normal;margin-bottom:15px;"">Because the evaporation of seawater leaves most of the salts behind, mist water has a <b>lower mineral content</b> than many surface and ground waters. In addition, cloud water has a mineral ""signature"" reminiscent of its oceanic origin and is softer in composition than its earthbound counterparts. As a result of its low mineral content (less than 50 parts-per-million of dissolved salts), it serves as a unique potable water when treated and as high quality non-potable water for a wide range of other uses. </p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Optimal sites include hilltops, coastal bluffs, and similar upslope locations on either private or public lands. Fog, temperature and wind maps are also useful in selecting the most productive sites. The towers are generally located at a higher elevation than the users so there is no need to mechanically pump water to its destination. </p>

<p>We will build a <b>Mist Water Farm</b> in California to produce clean, high quality water. The size and production of the water farm will depend on the acreage that we can secure and a number of climatic parameters that vary from year to year. The goal is to build a  <b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">200-tower water farm</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> with a potential capacity exceeding half a million gallons of water per year. We will subcontract bottling </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">facilities and their associated services for whatever portion of the harvested fog is used for drinking water. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Mist Water Farm will also serve as a demonstration of the cloud water capture technology for those who may wish to build their own collection systems based on our model. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We anticipate that the funds collected will be spent on the following tasks over the next 18 months. The allocation of funds for the various tasks will be shared will all the backers of this project:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Identifying Final Site</b>: June-August 2016</li>
<li>
<b>Environmental Siting/Permitting</b>: September-December 2016</li>
<li>
<b>Constructing Initial Water Farm</b>: January-April 2017</li>
<li>
<b>Water Testing/Permitting: </b>May-July 2017</li>
<li>
<b>Using/Enjoying the Water</b>: August-December 2017</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Although the timing of these tasks may appear somewhat extended, we want to be realistic about our expectations and transparent with our supporters. We may face unavoidable delays in <b>siting or constructing the towers and permitting the water </b>because ours represents a relatively new technology and an unconventional water source. <b>In any case, the Foundation will be active from day one.</b></p>
<p>As soon as the project is funded, we will build a website to <b>share the progress</b> with our supporters, thus maintaining our commitment to integrity, transparency and responsibility. </p>

</ul>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">REASONS TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT</span><br/></p>
<p>We are aware that some crowd-funded projects have ultimately <b>failed in their execution</b>. Whereas we cannot guarantee success, the team has <b>years of experience in corporate and project management</b>, market analysis, scheduling, subcontracting, purchasing, problem solving, technical troubleshooting, scientific data analysis, regulatory compliance and other skills that will be instrumental in <b>making this project a success. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Let's review some of the reasons that we are so enthusiastic about transforming clouds into usable water and that we look forward to your support:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Social Responsibility</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. Thinking globally, we want to make this technology available
to people living in coastal arid regions who have limited access to affordable clean
water. Whereas seawater desalination and conventional air-to-water technologies
have been proposed as supplementary water sources, the </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">costs of constructing,
maintaining and powering</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> these systems are often prohibitive. As such, these other
technologies are often restricted to affluent populations living in industrialized nations</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. </span>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Resource Responsibility</b>. Surface and groundwater resources in arid regions are
often overexploited to the point that yearly variations in precipitation create
catastrophic shortfalls in water availability. Our technology does not deplete the
existing blue or green water supplies (using the terminology of water footprints)
because <b>water collected from coastal fog or mist rarely produces any measurable
precipitation</b> that would otherwise contribute to local water resources. Even the
water used to rinse the towers and filters is collected from the clouds. </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Environmental Responsibility</b>. Because our technology is powered largely by
wind and gravity, <b>its energy footprint is very small</b> and related predominantly to the
manufacture of its component materials. In addition, its environmental footprint is
minimal because the installation <b>occupies a relatively small area and produces no
wastes</b>. The height of the towers and area of the base can be adjusted to conform to
diverse landscapes or settings. </span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Fiscal Responsibility</b>. Although we are in business to make a profit, our primary
commitment is to expand the utilization of a potential water resource in arid coastal
regions of the world. In doing so, <b>we are committed to preserving the local
environment and water resources</b>, as well as the integrity of the land and
communities within which our technology is implemented. A substantial portion of
our profits will be directed toward R&amp;D efforts to further advance this technology and to fund our Foundation.</span></li>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460220444/risks_wtsj9g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our contingency plan includes the consideration of risks, as well as appropriate</span> preventative actions (P.A.) to minimize or avoid the risks and contingency actions (C.A.) to either deal with the risks or identify alternatives. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks</b></li>
<li><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Preventive actions (P.A.)</b></li>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Contingency actions (C.A.)</b><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The primary risks that we anticipate include the following:</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Natural disasters: Storms, wildfires, earthquakes.</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>P.A. While we cannot predict or prevent natural disasters, the Mist towers can be easily raised and lowered by a single person. Hence, we can minimize damage from high winds or earthquakes when towers are in their non-operational position.</p>
<p>C.A. Should we need to rebuild our towers, the major damage is likely to be replacing the fabric mesh and, perhaps, sections of the aluminum frame. These materials are readily available and the towers can be rebuilt relatively quickly.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Financial issues: Insufficient capital.</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>P.A. We have used our technical experience in Spain and practical experience in California to estimate the costs associated with completing this project, and we believe that we have presented a realistic budget.</p>
<p>C.A. In the event that we encounter financial difficulties, we have the option of supplementing our crowdsourced funds with investments from venture capitalists. We have already spoken with several interested investors; however, we prefer to remain independent if it is feasible to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Securing a suitable location.</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>P.A. We have already studied wind, temperature, humidity, topographic and other maps to narrow our selection of suitable sites. What we don't know yet is whether we can secure access to those sites (situated on private or public lands) through rentals, grants, or cooperative agreements.</p>
<p>C.A. There are many potential locations for siting the the Mist Water Farms, and one of our contingency actions is simply to select alternative sites. If we find there are financial issues with property owners, there are options for sharing the water or, if the water is sold, for sharing revenues from the water. </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Permitting a novel land use.</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>P.A. Upon finding a suitable site(s) and successfully negotiating an agreement with the property owners, the use of the land for harvesting cloud water will need to be permitted. This may include conventional land use disclosures as well as any environmental assessment reports that may be required. </p>
<p>C.A. If the required permits or reports cannot be obtained within a reasonable timeframe or at an affordable cost, other sites (e.g., private land in lieu of public lands) or more easily permitted uses will be considered. </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Permitting an unconventional water use.</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>P.A. Whether the water is used for non-potable purposes or is treated and bottled as a drinking water, there will be a need to chemically characterize the water and permit it according to the existing regulations. The harvested cloud water will likely constitute a new category, which may delay the permitting processes.</p>
<p>C.A. Permits to use the water for non-potable uses (if required) will be obtained initially. Drinking water permits will subsequently be pursued. Provided that the water does not contain pollutants, permitting issues should not halt the project</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">FINAL CONTINGENCY</span><br/></p>
<p>Given the worst case scenario that we are unable to produce water from California, we would still be able to provide our contributors bottled water from Mist's pilot water farm in the Canary Islands. Approximately 6 months would be required to approve the exportation of this water from Spain; however, we would uphold our commitment to the people who backed this campaign.</p>

Mist represents an entirely new way of collecting water directly from the clouds. Our system is clean, efficient, sustainable, environmentally friendly…and so romantic!
Read our entire story and then join us in passionately creating something innovative, valuable, practical and affordable for California and other coastal regions of the world. You are also invited to build a humanitarian project with us.




Mist has focused on expanding and improving a technology that has been used successfully to harvest fog or the tiny water droplets in low-lying clouds. Little or none of this low-lying cloud water (also known as a marine layer) ever develops into measurable precipitation.
We have improved the efficiency of fog capture techniques so that a single tower with only a 17 square-foot base can collect over 250 gallons of water per day under optimal atmospheric conditions. Imagine what a multi-tower facility could produce in your community! 





We have designed the technology to collect water from the clouds or fog without a need for measurable precipitation (i.e., rain or snow). The technique is actually one borrowed from nature and could be considered a form of biomimicry or hydromimcry. Plants and some soils can utilize fog and mist as a water source by condensing the microscopic cloud droplets into liquid water on leaves or particles in order to create their own mini-irrigation systems. 


Our towers collect water similar to plants and soils through the use of special fabrics that are arranged as a series of mesh curtains capable of transforming the tiny droplets into larger drops. These drops then move downward by gravity to the the tower's collector, which channels flowing water into pipes that lead to natural filters and a holding tank. This entire process is completed without the use of electrical energy.





The collected fog or mist can be used for just about any application that requires a high quality water. Given the drought conditions in California, where aquifers and surface waters have been overexploited, we are interested in providing the region with local opportunities for people to conserve scarce water resources.
Water from these towers has been used to produce a small batch of bottled drinking water in Spain; however, the collection and filtration systems can be tailored to many other applications such as agriculture, livestock, fire protection, and domestic use (e.g., washing, irrigating gardens).

There are certain regions where access to water is extremely difficult, and some of these regions possess climates that are conducive to seasonal fog production. As such, Mist Water Farms could be installed to provide additional clean water.
We will proudly donate 30% of the proceeds we collect during this campaign to the Mist Water Foundation, which is a non-profit organization focused on providing high quality water (via the Mist Water Farms) to communities with limited access to other sources of fresh water. The Foundation will be created as soon as the funds are received from this campaign. 
Mist is committed to the Foundation. We will fund the Mist Water Foundation (MWF) with a regular share of our profits each year. MWF will function as an independent entity that sponsors fundraising campaigns and collaborates with other NGOs to ensure this technology works for the people who need it most.
When you support this campaign, you are also supporting a humanitarian initiative that strives to make a better world by emulating the way that nature captures water from the cloud and mists.



The water collected from the low-lying clouds never touches the ground and, in fact, remains a largely unused resource for humans if it is not captured by a technique similar to ours.


Mist water collected on California's coastal hillsides originates in the surface waters of the Pacific Ocean that are located far upwind from populated coastal areas. Unique climatic conditions created by the cold ocean and warm land produce a marine layer that moves to and from coastal areas on the prevailing winds. We catch this fog water as it moves past the coastal hills and cliffs from the ocean.


Because the evaporation of seawater leaves most of the salts behind, mist water has a lower mineral content than many surface and ground waters. In addition, cloud water has a mineral ""signature"" reminiscent of its oceanic origin and is softer in composition than its earthbound counterparts. As a result of its low mineral content (less than 50 parts-per-million of dissolved salts), it serves as a unique potable water when treated and as high quality non-potable water for a wide range of other uses. 


Although specific atmospheric and topographic conditions are necessary to support the efficient operation of our water collection system, its applications are diverse. Any region where fog is consistently present for all or part of the day and winds commonly blow onshore is suitable for this technology.








Mist water systems do not require a power source or a complicated installation; hence, the only major necessities are a small plot of land upon which the towers can be manually raised and lowered. The tanks, filters and piping are simply designed, require no specialized components, and operate under the force of gravity.
Optimal sites include hilltops, coastal bluffs, and similar upslope locations on either private or public lands. Fog, temperature and wind maps are also useful in selecting the most productive sites. The towers are generally located at a higher elevation than the users so there is no need to mechanically pump water to its destination. 






We will build a Mist Water Farm in California to produce clean, high quality water. The size and production of the water farm will depend on the acreage that we can secure and a number of climatic parameters that vary from year to year. The goal is to build a  200-tower water farm with a potential capacity exceeding half a million gallons of water per year. We will subcontract bottling facilities and their associated services for whatever portion of the harvested fog is used for drinking water. 
The Mist Water Farm will also serve as a demonstration of the cloud water capture technology for those who may wish to build their own collection systems based on our model. We anticipate that the funds collected will be spent on the following tasks over the next 18 months. The allocation of funds for the various tasks will be shared will all the backers of this project:


Identifying Final Site: June-August 2016

Environmental Siting/Permitting: September-December 2016

Constructing Initial Water Farm: January-April 2017

Water Testing/Permitting: May-July 2017

Using/Enjoying the Water: August-December 2017


Although the timing of these tasks may appear somewhat extended, we want to be realistic about our expectations and transparent with our supporters. We may face unavoidable delays in siting or constructing the towers and permitting the water because ours represents a relatively new technology and an unconventional water source. In any case, the Foundation will be active from day one.
As soon as the project is funded, we will build a website to share the progress with our supporters, thus maintaining our commitment to integrity, transparency and responsibility. 
Ask for our exclusive SECRET perks should you want to have access to influence Mist.
You might be wondering about the identity of these cloud-catching guys and about why you would back this project. We have the answer to both questions.

REASONS TO SUPPORT THIS PROJECT
We are aware that some crowd-funded projects have ultimately failed in their execution. Whereas we cannot guarantee success, the team has years of experience in corporate and project management, market analysis, scheduling, subcontracting, purchasing, problem solving, technical troubleshooting, scientific data analysis, regulatory compliance and other skills that will be instrumental in making this project a success. 

Let's review some of the reasons that we are so enthusiastic about transforming clouds into usable water and that we look forward to your support:



Social Responsibility. Thinking globally, we want to make this technology available
to people living in coastal arid regions who have limited access to affordable clean
water. Whereas seawater desalination and conventional air-to-water technologies
have been proposed as supplementary water sources, the costs of constructing,
maintaining and powering these systems are often prohibitive. As such, these other
technologies are often restricted to affluent populations living in industrialized nations. 

Resource Responsibility. Surface and groundwater resources in arid regions are
often overexploited to the point that yearly variations in precipitation create
catastrophic shortfalls in water availability. Our technology does not deplete the
existing blue or green water supplies (using the terminology of water footprints)
because water collected from coastal fog or mist rarely produces any measurable
precipitation that would otherwise contribute to local water resources. Even the
water used to rinse the towers and filters is collected from the clouds. 
Environmental Responsibility. Because our technology is powered largely by
wind and gravity, its energy footprint is very small and related predominantly to the
manufacture of its component materials. In addition, its environmental footprint is
minimal because the installation occupies a relatively small area and produces no
wastes. The height of the towers and area of the base can be adjusted to conform to
diverse landscapes or settings. 
Fiscal Responsibility. Although we are in business to make a profit, our primary
commitment is to expand the utilization of a potential water resource in arid coastal
regions of the world. In doing so, we are committed to preserving the local
environment and water resources, as well as the integrity of the land and
communities within which our technology is implemented. A substantial portion of
our profits will be directed toward R&D efforts to further advance this technology and to fund our Foundation.







Our contingency plan includes the consideration of risks, as well as appropriate preventative actions (P.A.) to minimize or avoid the risks and contingency actions (C.A.) to either deal with the risks or identify alternatives. 


Risks
Preventive actions (P.A.)

Contingency actions (C.A.)


The primary risks that we anticipate include the following:


Natural disasters: Storms, wildfires, earthquakes.

P.A. While we cannot predict or prevent natural disasters, the Mist towers can be easily raised and lowered by a single person. Hence, we can minimize damage from high winds or earthquakes when towers are in their non-operational position.
C.A. Should we need to rebuild our towers, the major damage is likely to be replacing the fabric mesh and, perhaps, sections of the aluminum frame. These materials are readily available and the towers can be rebuilt relatively quickly.


Financial issues: Insufficient capital.

P.A. We have used our technical experience in Spain and practical experience in California to estimate the costs associated with completing this project, and we believe that we have presented a realistic budget.
C.A. In the event that we encounter financial difficulties, we have the option of supplementing our crowdsourced funds with investments from venture capitalists. We have already spoken with several interested investors; however, we prefer to remain independent if it is feasible to do so.


Securing a suitable location.

P.A. We have already studied wind, temperature, humidity, topographic and other maps to narrow our selection of suitable sites. What we don't know yet is whether we can secure access to those sites (situated on private or public lands) through rentals, grants, or cooperative agreements.
C.A. There are many potential locations for siting the the Mist Water Farms, and one of our contingency actions is simply to select alternative sites. If we find there are financial issues with property owners, there are options for sharing the water or, if the water is sold, for sharing revenues from the water. 


Permitting a novel land use.

P.A. Upon finding a suitable site(s) and successfully negotiating an agreement with the property owners, the use of the land for harvesting cloud water will need to be permitted. This may include conventional land use disclosures as well as any environmental assessment reports that may be required. 
C.A. If the required permits or reports cannot be obtained within a reasonable timeframe or at an affordable cost, other sites (e.g., private land in lieu of public lands) or more easily permitted uses will be considered. 


Permitting an unconventional water use.

P.A. Whether the water is used for non-potable purposes or is treated and bottled as a drinking water, there will be a need to chemically characterize the water and permit it according to the existing regulations. The harvested cloud water will likely constitute a new category, which may delay the permitting processes.
C.A. Permits to use the water for non-potable uses (if required) will be obtained initially. Drinking water permits will subsequently be pursued. Provided that the water does not contain pollutants, permitting issues should not halt the project
FINAL CONTINGENCY
Given the worst case scenario that we are unable to produce water from California, we would still be able to provide our contributors bottled water from Mist's pilot water farm in the Canary Islands. Approximately 6 months would be required to approve the exportation of this water from Spain; however, we would uphold our commitment to the people who backed this campaign.",13.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>The true full-spectrum of natural light energy <i>—balanced with both visible and invisible light— </i>is essential for the development, growth and maintenance of a healthy body and mind.</p>

<ul>
<li>Every metabolic process, enzyme reaction, muscular movement, the digestion of food and the burning of fat are augmented by sunlight energy.</li>

""One third of the energy your body consumes comes from the food you eat. The vast majority of the energy your body needs to maintain systemic equilibrium comes from environmental infrared light exposure."" 
—Dr. Alexander Wunsch, MD, PhD,
World Class Expert on Photobiology
~ ~ ~
The true full-spectrum of natural light energy —balanced with both visible and invisible light— is essential for the development, growth and maintenance of a healthy body and mind.
Natural light stimulates the metabolic activity of cells to create a process similar to plant photosynthesis whereby plants use chlorophyll to convert sunlight into cellular building blocks.The light is absorbed by the cells and produces an amazing cascade of events...

Every metabolic process, enzyme reaction, muscular movement, the digestion of food and the burning of fat are augmented by sunlight energy.
A reduction of natural light energy causes a slowdown in these processes that leads to decreased metabolism, reduced burning of fat, reduced vitality & compromised immunity.

Health care costs are out of control, obesity is epidemic and depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide. Depression alone affects an estimated 350 million people globally, including more than 16 million Americans, 6 million of whom are seniors.
We're on a mission to raise awareness of mal-illumination, a contemporary syndrome that impacts obesity, depression, fatigue, sleep and many other serious health conditions.
Our mandate is to provide leading edge technology that reduces the risk of this silent epidemic.

Mal-illumination is unwittingly affecting millions of people that are truly in the dark about their health!
Not enough balanced, natural light and too much artificial light disrupts brain chemistry, metabolism and vital circadian rhythms that control appetite, energy, mood, sleep, libido and more.

“Mal-illumination is to Light as Malnutrition is to Food ”   
— Dr. John Ott~ ~ ~We're raising awareness and remedying mal-illumination by designing and providing the . . . 'Fullest' —Spectrum Therapeutic Light
We originally founded Ott Light Systems, Santa Barbara, California in 1987 with the approval and support of the father of full-spectrum light (FSL) technology, Dr. John Ott.
Repurposed as Science of Light (SOL), we are now a 501(c)(3) non-profit on a mission to enlighten humanity. SOL is pleased to have a patent pending that builds on and improves Dr. Ott's original FSL technology.
""We have finally learned that light is a nutrient much like food, and like food, the wrong kind can make us ill and the right kind can help keep us well.""

SOLshine Photo-Nutrition™ —light activated health 

Patent pending SOLshine provides both 'visible & invisible' light akin to balanced, natural sunshine.
 
 


 'Fullest' -Spectrum LED
97 CRI (Minimum)
5000 Kelvin
Near Infrared (NIR)
Trace UV
PAR 38
25 Watt
Remote control


Essential NIR is missing in other lights.

Sunlight is loaded with red and NIR light. LED light exposure that’s not balanced like the sun  — can be damaging  to human biology... especially your eyes.

NIR helps prime the cells in your retina for ‘repair and regeneration’ and helps reduce the risk of macular degeneration.
NIR is also vital to the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in your mitochondria.
Mitochondria may be considered the power generators of the cell, converting oxygen and nutrients into energy.
ATP is the fuel cells need for all of their varied functions including metabolism.
Molecules that absorb infrared light are found in your mitochondria and assist with the production of ATP. 


Not all full-spectrum light is created equal.
SOLshine emits light (combined) from several different leading-edge LED chip sources. The Spectral Power Distribution (SPD) graph below, primarily represents SOLshine’s visible spectrum LED component. SOLshine’s proprietary near infrared LEDs are not displayed.

Over the last few months I have been learning about and adjusting to life as a diabetic.This diagnosis revealed a desire within me to learn as much as I can about my disease for the improvement in the quality of my life as well as the lives of others and ultimately led me to further my education at Kent State in pursuit of a Master's Degree in Human Biology.After graduating with my Master's in May of 2018, I will matriculate to Kent State University's College of Podiatric Medicine class of 2022 where I hope my personal experiences and acquired knowledge will uplift and empower those that need support living with diabetes while pursuing higher education as well as highly demanding careers. [Assimilate Success through your Diet] [What are Nootropics?] [Diabetics Rely on the Maintenance of Blood Glucose via Diet] [Competitors Products Lack Nootropic Ingredients and Lack Medicinal CBD] [Our Solution - Easily Portable Nootropic CBD Enhanced TwiceToastedTreats] [What is CBD?] [CBD Receptors are Located in Various Tissues from the Brain to the Bones] [Receptor Locations Allow CBD to Function as Medication for Numerous Ailments]Although TwiceToastedTreats will be formulated to benefit Diabetics, due to CBD's extensive list of medicinal properties the treats pain relieving and symptom reversing qualities are applicable to a medley of disorders.[Where will we get our CBD from?]The best products come from the highest quality ingredients, ""Not All Hemp is Created Equal"" and Folium Biosciences remains a leader in the industry of CBD rich hemp cultivation and distribution.[How will we get our product to our customers?]Utilizing e-commerce services such as Fulfilment by Amazon, Shopify, Wix and/or Volusion in conjunction with our already purchased domain ""www.TwiceToastedTreats.com"" will provide our customers with the convenient online storefront necessary to easily browse, purchase, rate and review our products.[Company Vision: A Treat for the World]We believe more than enough money can be generated via Cannabis Sales, Cultivation and Education such that no single individual has to pay full price for Insulin via our ICLP CashBack Program.Non-profit efforts would go towards funding the Insulin Cashback Loyalty Program as well as the eventual decentralization of Insulin Production and Redistribution.“Practical, world-shifting change occurs at the intersection of physical limitation and mental determination. Our goal is to work for the sick and cultivate an ecosystem of limbic communication - a collective consciousness evicting unfair healthcare business practices.”  - CEO Tanaka Mupinga [Financial Projection and Target Demographic]1) People Living with DiabetesIn 2012, the global diabetes market yielded $28.1 billion in sales. Currently, 29.1 Million Americans have been diagnosed with Diabetes with the predicted increase in disease prevalence, global sales are expected to grow to $67.7 billion in 2022. 2) Knowledge Seeking Society“Knowledge is Power and Nootropics make Learning easier.”Students and Individuals aiming to achieve success in highly competitive fields will be able to supplement their efforts with an easily portable, storable, healthy and hunger quenching food-bar. 3) Retirement trends and the Baby Boomer GenerationAging is unavoidable and Pain Management substances infused with TwiceToastedTreats can be provided without a prescription, and are available without insurance in the form of great tasting lozenges that can be easily consumed by the Elderly (Geriatrics). 4) Patient Preferred Pain Relief for most Chronic illnesses""40% of Americans have difficulty swallowing pills.""Medication in the form of food and/or candy allows patients to feel like everyone else instead of constantly carrying around and/or swallowing pills.In addition, alternative non-addictive means of Pain Management such as CBD have the potential to impact the so-called Opioid Epidemic affecting the United States.  [Startup Costs] [Contact Information] [Prototype]""At 24 years old - I have a degree in Biology with minor in Chemistry (2016)  and recently earned a Master's Degree with a concentration in Human Biology (2018). When they ask me how I did it...my answer will be ""TwiceToastedTreats"". - CEO Tanaka MupingaNootropic CBD Granola bars are easily portable with a shelf life of 6 to 8 months.Nootropic CBD Lozenges have a shelf life of 14 months.[Logo]For me, aesthetics are a large part of this company.

<h3>WE HAVE ALREADY FUNDED 100+ ON OUR OWN SITE'S PRE-SALE!!!</h3>
<p>Global Shave Clubs has succesfully completed replicas of the 1965 Gillette Tech and the 1949 Gillette Super Speed. But now, we have turned our attention to the much sought after Gillette Model 195 Fat Boy.</p>
<p>Founded in 2016, Golbal Shave Clubs prides itself on the 14 different razors that we have introduced, mostly original designs, and of course the replica razors that we also produce.

<h3>OUR GOAL IS TO FUND ANOTHER 200 IN THIS CAMPAIGN.</h3>
<p>We leaked to a few of our YouTube Reviewers that we were going to go live with this campaign in March and much to our surprise, the cat got let out of the bag eaarly. We were innondated with emails begging us to create a pre-sale on our website. Much to our delight, 100+ Fat Boy Replicas were sold in just a few days.</p>

<p>Larry DeAngelis (Founder and Managing Partner) from Level25. The #1 Rated Sleep Shot for 2019.</p>
<p>This Campaign is about helping our customers with insomnia, stress and sleep issues during an unprecedented time. It is also about the reality of being a small business startup who falls between the cracks of the Federal Stimulus Program. </p>
<p><strong>We have real customers, multiple re-orders, great reviews, rated #1 Sleep shot for 2019, $100,000 of retail inventory (all paid for).</strong> But unfortunately, we were not the Lakers of Ruth Chris. We are simply a start up company providing a necessary product to help people get the rest they need now and in the future.</p>
<p>We had $25,000 in new orders cancel and the online sales flattened as well when Covid 19 struck. Our expenses are low and our liabilities are minimal.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise $75,000 – $150,000 to build on online sales channels and move into new verticals with the introduction of ""The Sleeping Bag"" which makes a great corporate gift. We are offering a Royalty Pool for those who believe in the direction Level25 is going and would like to participate in that growth.</p>
<p><strong>I have built two $15 million  consumer product companies in Revolution Tea (Founder)  and Biomedic Clinical Care (CFO).

<p> </p>
<h3>Why We Created Level25?</h3>
<p>Level25 was born out of my role as a parent. As a father, watching my children experience high amounts of stress and anxiety in their 20’s was heartbreaking. For me, my 20’s were a time of fun and friends and I wanted the same for my children. So, I began hunting for a solution.</p>
<p>Our society has grown accustomed to medicating and escaping from stress through alcohol and prescription drugs. But these intoxicants fail to break the negative cycle of stress and, eventually, can lead to increased anxiety, depression, and addiction.</p>
<p>How could we break the cycle? There has to be a natural solution that can “take the edge off” and allow our body and mind to get the proper rest it needs.</p>
<p>That’s when Level25 was born. After extensive research and many failed attempts, I, along with the help of my team (Jeff, Josh, Chuck, Theresa and Bill), crafted a formula that was the perfect combination of natural ingredients, all known for their relaxation properties and ability to promote increase sleep quality and rest. Level25 is a premium product that delivers the best natural ingredients in 25 minutes or less.</p>
<p>We are all part of a time I like to call “Generation Stress”. Maybe this is because of the proliferation of smartphones and social media that demand our constant attention. Maybe, we are just simply living too fast. At Level25, we believe it is important to slow down and make time for the body and mind to relax, rest and recharge.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What People Are Saying</h3>
<p><strong>Great sleep &amp; no snoring!</strong> This product puts me to sleep very fast! My husband really liked the taste, which says a lot because he’s very picky. We both took the supplement before bed &amp; I never heard him snore. So either this product really does keep him from snoring, or I was sleeping so soundly I never heard a peep! I recommend giving this a try if you struggle falling asleep and staying asleep. Or if your significant other snores and keeps you up at night.</p>
<p><strong>AMAZING...allows me to sleep next to my man!</strong> Lifesaver. Several reasons why I LOVE this product. 1. I prefer not to take medication as I respond poorly from side effects. When I have tried sleep aids, I feel horrible in the morning or they just don’t work. I do not want to take habit forming medications. The ingredients in this product are none of the above, and tastes great 2. Stress. We all have it. Sometimes more times then others. I can take this anytime I need it without worry and KNOW it works. I can sleep which in itself, helps decrease my stress. 3. I can travel and take it with me and sleep better in hotels, with jet lag, etc AND 4. For the ladies.... sick if your spouse’s snoring? Well good night! I can sleep through it! I’ve recommended this simple solution to so many of my friends and have only heard success stories. Give it a try, turn off your mind and go to sleep! (And skip the “hang over” in the morning!) </p>
<p><strong>Great Product!!!!</strong> Love this stuff!! It stops my husband from snoring!!! WOW!! He sleeps deeper and doesn't make a peep!!! Highly recommend, relaxes you and makes it easier to fall asleep as it mellows you out. </p>
<p><strong>Calm sleep, great taste.</strong> Level 25 really helps ease me into a pleasant sleep. After my day it’s hard to settle down, but after drinking this sleep aid, I am able to get calm and quiet sleep. It also tastes amazing! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Power of Our Proprietary Ingredients</h3>
<p><strong>GABA –</strong> Enables the body and mind to relax, fall asleep, and sleep soundly throughout the night.</p>
<p><strong>Kava Kava Extract –</strong> A herb commonly used for its calming properties.</p>
<p><strong>Lavender Extract –</strong> While lavender is a popular choice in aromatherapy for sleep and relaxation, ingesting its extract also has calming qualities on the body and mind.</p>
<p><strong>L-Theanine –</strong> An amino acid that promotes relaxation.<br/>Valerian Root Extract – A root commonly used for sleep disorders.</p>
<p><strong>5-HTP –</strong> A naturally-occurring amino acid used to produce serotonin that can be converted to melatonin, which helps you sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Melatonin –</strong> While melatonin is found naturally in the body, sometimes we need a little extra help producing enough to get us to sleep!</p>

The ingredients in this product are none of the above, and tastes great 2. Stress. We all have it. Sometimes more times then others. I can take this anytime I need it without worry and KNOW it works. I can sleep which in itself, helps decrease my stress. 3. I can travel and take it with me and sleep better in hotels, with jet lag, etc AND 4. For the ladies.... sick if your spouse’s snoring? Well good night! I can sleep through it! I’ve recommended this simple solution to so many of my friends and have only heard success stories. Give it a try, turn off your mind and go to sleep! (And skip the “hang over” in the morning!) 
Great Product!!!! Love this stuff!! It stops my husband from snoring!!! WOW!! He sleeps deeper and doesn't make a peep!!! Highly recommend, relaxes you and makes it easier to fall asleep as it mellows you out. 
Calm sleep, great taste. Level 25 really helps ease me into a pleasant sleep. After my day it’s hard to settle down, but after drinking this sleep aid, I am able to get calm and quiet sleep. It also tastes amazing!

<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Julia! My ultimate goal is to bring the innovative solution to the veterinary field and prevent the animals from pain and suffering.</p>
<p>Biomaterials have always been a topic of my interest. In 2012, I was honoured with an opportunity to perform PhD studies at the Orthopaedic Research Unit, University of Turku, Finland. I defended my PhD degree in February 2015. The thesis was focused on composite orthopaedic bone implants with special reference to staphylococcal infections. I was involved in several successfully completed large scale research projects. These included studies conceived in the framework of a large-scale EU-funded project and a screening study performed in cooperation with the leading Finnish pharmaceutical company Orion Ltd. My PhD project gave me an excellent opportunity of working in an international environment with academic and medical professionals.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489047535/ejdhultn0j7xfbugetpi.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>My research activities continued after the PhD defence. Since March 2015, I have been volunteering as a post-doctoral trainee at the University of Turku. My post-doctoral research project is focused on the treatment of long bone fractures in veterinary patients. In April 2015, I co-founded TraceRay Oy, a young innovative company and made a patent application related to the topic of my research to exploit my innovations aimed at the treatment of veterinary patients. Currently, the resources of the start-up company are being stretched to the limit. TraceRay is striving to get pre-seed investment. Therefore, we greatly appreciate any help!</p>
<h3>About the Problem We Are Trying to Solve</h3>
<p><strong>Small dogs have a much higher propensity to fractures of the long bones compared to other breeds.</strong> In small dogs, these fractures may occur as a result of even minimal trauma such as falling from the owners` arms or sofa. The causative mechanisms for this type of fractures are related to the low body weight (&lt; 5 kg), reduced intraosseous blood supply and breed related changes in bones. Therefore, <strong>the mechanical strength of long bones in small dogs is much lower than that in other breed species</strong>, which significantly affect the mechanical behavior of these bones.</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489421668/jsnog2hzy70dl69omtgo.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>The use of a cast or splint alone in the majority of the cases does not provide adequate stability</strong>; therefore, there is an increased risk of fibrous non-union formation. Preferably, the fracture segments should be anatomically stabilized with a plate and screws. Metals are currently in use for veterinary orthopaedic implants. However, <strong>metallic implants have intrinsic drawbacks</strong>. The stiffness of the metals is much higher than that of bone. Therefore, when metallic implants are introduced, an unfavorable load distribution known as “stress-shielding” may occur. Stress-shielding, debris formation from multi-component implants and metallosis may result in peri-prosthetic bone loss and aseptic loosening of the implant. Due to the bone loss, revision surgery could be significantly more complex with increased risk of complications.</p>
<p>Although the fracture pattern is simple, in small dogs even an ideal surgical intervention protocol may lead to postoperative complications. <strong>A delayed union and non-union as well as refracture after plate removal are severe complications which are more distinctive in small dogs</strong>. In addition, it is highly important to note, that all implants are to some extent prone to bacterial colonization. Clinical observations have shown that the presence of skeletal implants promotes immediate and delayed infections which may challenge the success of implantation. Overall, <strong>the fractures of long bones have a high intensity of welfare impact as they are extremely painful and stress-causing injuries.</strong> The prognosis for small dogs with these types of fractures where initial veterinary intervention has failed is unpredictable. <strong>Unfortunately, the majority of the cases are not amenable to salvage, particularly individuals with advanced osteoporosis. In certain circumstances, limb amputation is the only alternative</strong>.</p>

The innovative non-metallic plates developed in this project by TraceRay will <strong>have the greatest impact on the quality of life of the treated animals</strong>. Due to the enhanced biocompatibility of the device, <strong>the number of delayed and non-union fractures will decrease</strong>. The plates will boost the remodeling processes in bone; and thus <strong>the healing time will be shorter to compare with that of metallic plates</strong>. This will <strong>allow early and complete return of function</strong>. Currently, roughly 90-95% of the bone grafts in veterinary orthopaedics are autografts. However, the use of autografts requires additional surgery on another part of the body, which may cause complications.  In fact, in small dogs, the complications are even more severe, as the amount of bone at the donor site is limited. The innovative non-metallic plates represent a unique concept, which allow<strong> less invasive surgical procedures</strong> than currently in use. The structure and design of the innovative non-metallic plate are versatile and carry a possibility to modify the surface bioactivity by incorporation of drugs and other bioactive components to boost the healing process.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">For the past 2-3 years we have been developing a solution to a common problem experienced by many people whilst exercising; the need to carry multiple bottles with different liquids such as water, energy drinks and supplement drinks to both replenish and rehydrate. Having to carry several bottles around with you every time you workout or do any kind of exercise is inconvenient and can become a continuous hassle.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We were tired of having to put up with this whilst exercising and wanted something that presented an element of convenience to our workouts. </p>
<h4>Duothirst is the solution to this problem.<br/>
</h4>

<h4><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>The Best Sports Bottle Ever?</b></span></h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We designed Duothirst to be more than just a
water bottle. We wanted it to seamlessly fit into your fitness lifestyle and
give you the flexibility and choice of what you want to drink and when you want
to drink it.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Convenience is one of the core principles we
designed Duothirst around. Its elegant design gives you practicality, flexibility
and choice every time you use it. We truly believe that Duothirst delivers this
like no other sports bottle out there. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We wanted the user to experience a new versatile way to stay hydrated like never before. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442187769/ezefqfwuy9j97ucryq7j.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Duothirst is comprised of 3 main components, the
lid, the identical bottle halves and the base component that holds them
together. The great thing about Duothirst, and one of the bottles main
features is the lid mechanism. We spent a long time designing and engineering this
so that it was possible to select either of the two bottle halves through just
one mouthpiece.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">But we didn't stop there; we also designed the
lid mechanism so that it could access both of the bottle halves at the same
time. This means that Duothirst can be used like any conventional sports bottle
to drink just one liquid, but also offer the choice of a mixture of two drinks.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Duothirst holds a total capacity of 800ml (27 US fluid oz) we believe this is the perfect amount to ensure that Duothirst is not too bulky or heavy. Each bottle half therefore holds 400ml (13.5 US fluid oz). </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Duothirst is a UK designed product and will also be manufactured and assembled in the UK to ensure that quality won't be compromised and that a premium end product will be produced. </p>

<h4>Access either compartment or both at the same time through just one mouthpiece</h4>
<div>One of our first design requirements for Duothirst was to ensure that the bottle only had  one mouthpiece to access either of the bottle halves. We have managed this through our uniquely designed lid mechanism. We spent a long time designing and engineering the mechanism and the great thing is it's so simple to use.</div>
<div><br/></div>

<b><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">
<b>Change between drinks in seconds</b> </h4></b>
</div>
</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">

We wanted to ensure that changing between drinks was effortless, enhancing the user experience. It's so easy to change between drinks, all you have to do is twist the top part of the lid and select which drink you want.  </div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442273540/kaqbpbdsgtmtcd02flpp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b><h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Access two drinks from a single bike bottle holder</b></h4></b>
</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">The design of Duothirst allows it to fit into all regular bike bottle holders. This then gives you the ability to access two drinks from the same bottle rack. </div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: left;"">We wanted to make sure that changing between drinks whilst cycling was still possible. To allow this we have designed the top of the lid so that you can bite down on the ridge and then turn the bottle with one hand to select which position you want.  <br/>
</div><div style=""text-align: left;""><br/></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442275822/zlz56kwymd1tqmkwbakl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Have one, two, or a mixture of two drinks</h4>
<div>One of the great things the lid mechanism allows you to do is access either bottle half or both at the same time. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If you choose to have two drinks in your bottle then you can select either of those two drinks or you can choose to have a mixture of the two drinks. </div>
<div>If you choose to only have one drink in both bottle halves then Duothirst will act like any other sports bottle out there letting you drink just one liquid simply turn it to the position that access both bottle halves. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So wether you want to have one, two, or a mixture of two drinks Duothirst lets you decide. </div>

<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Lightweight, Durable and Reusable </h4>
</div>
<div>We have designed Duothirst so that it is a lightweight and durable product. Duothirst is also reusable and will help you to break the habit of using disposable plastic bottles which just end up being disposed of in landfill sites. </div>

<div>Duothirst is a BPA (Bisphenol A) free sports bottle. We made sure this was the case to protect the health of the end user from the very beginning. What this basically means is that the materials and plastics Duothirst is made out of do not contain any of the harmful BPA chemicals. <br/>

<div>When designing Duothirst we had to ensure the product was leakproof. All of the Duothirst bottles will be 100% tested to ensure they are leakproof. How can we expect you to use such an amazing product if it can't function properly!</div>

</div></div>","Duothirst is a new versatile way to stay hydrated like never before. The innovative design allows you to maintain convenience during your workout also. 
Duothirst is the world's first single nozzled sports bottle that can hold two drinks simultaneously. It
is suitable for anyone who is trying to achieve a healthier lifestyle or
participate in sport at any level.


""Bringing versatility and convenience to everybody's workout""

A full 3D interactive model of the Duothirst bottle design can be viewed by clicking on the below link:


duothirst bottle








For the past 2-3 years we have been developing a solution to a common problem experienced by many people whilst exercising; the need to carry multiple bottles with different liquids such as water, energy drinks and supplement drinks to both replenish and rehydrate. Having to carry several bottles around with you every time you workout or do any kind of exercise is inconvenient and can become a continuous hassle.
We were tired of having to put up with this whilst exercising and wanted something that presented an element of convenience to our workouts. 
Duothirst is the solution to this problem.




The Best Sports Bottle Ever?
We designed Duothirst to be more than just a
water bottle. We wanted it to seamlessly fit into your fitness lifestyle and
give you the flexibility and choice of what you want to drink and when you want
to drink it.


Convenience is one of the core principles we
designed Duothirst around. Its elegant design gives you practicality, flexibility
and choice every time you use it. We truly believe that Duothirst delivers this
like no other sports bottle out there. 
We wanted the user to experience a new versatile way to stay hydrated like never before. 


Duothirst is comprised of 3 main components, the
lid, the identical bottle halves and the base component that holds them
together. The great thing about Duothirst, and one of the bottles main
features is the lid mechanism. We spent a long time designing and engineering this
so that it was possible to select either of the two bottle halves through just
one mouthpiece.
But we didn't stop there; we also designed the
lid mechanism so that it could access both of the bottle halves at the same
time. This means that Duothirst can be used like any conventional sports bottle
to drink just one liquid, but also offer the choice of a mixture of two drinks.
Duothirst holds a total capacity of 800ml (27 US fluid oz) we believe this is the perfect amount to ensure that Duothirst is not too bulky or heavy. Each bottle half therefore holds 400ml (13.5 US fluid oz). 
Duothirst is a UK designed product and will also be manufactured and assembled in the UK to ensure that quality won't be compromised and that a premium end product will be produced. 




Bringing an element of convenience to everybody's workout 
Duothirst allows you to stay hydrated whilst maintaining convenience. No longer do you have to carry several bottles around with you for your different drinks whilst exercising. Carry them both in your elegantly designed sleek Duothirst bottle.  

Access either compartment or both at the same time through just one mouthpiece
One of our first design requirements for Duothirst was to ensure that the bottle only had  one mouthpiece to access either of the bottle halves. We have managed this through our uniquely designed lid mechanism. We spent a long time designing and engineering the mechanism and the great thing is it's so simple to use.




Change between drinks in seconds 



We wanted to ensure that changing between drinks was effortless, enhancing the user experience. It's so easy to change between drinks, all you have to do is twist the top part of the lid and select which drink you want.  

Access two drinks from a single bike bottle holder
The design of Duothirst allows it to fit into all regular bike bottle holders. This then gives you the ability to access two drinks from the same bottle rack. We wanted to make sure that changing between drinks whilst cycling was still possible. To allow this we have designed the top of the lid so that you can bite down on the ridge and then turn the bottle with one hand to select which position you want.  


Have one, two, or a mixture of two drinks
One of the great things the lid mechanism allows you to do is access either bottle half or both at the same time. 

If you choose to have two drinks in your bottle then you can select either of those two drinks or you can choose to have a mixture of the two drinks. 
If you choose to only have one drink in both bottle halves then Duothirst will act like any other sports bottle out there letting you drink just one liquid simply turn it to the position that access both bottle halves. 

So wether you want to have one, two, or a mixture of two drinks Duothirst lets you decide. 



Lightweight, Durable and Reusable 

We have designed Duothirst so that it is a lightweight and durable product. Duothirst is also reusable and will help you to break the habit of using disposable plastic bottles which just end up being disposed of in landfill sites. 



Duothirst is a BPA (Bisphenol A) free sports bottle. We made sure this was the case to protect the health of the end user from the very beginning. What this basically means is that the materials and plastics Duothirst is made out of do not contain any of the harmful BPA chemicals. 



When designing Duothirst we had to ensure the product was leakproof. All of the Duothirst bottles will be 100% tested to ensure they are leakproof. How can we expect you to use such an amazing product if it can't function properly!


Duothirst is easy to clean and it is dishwasher safe also. The lid has been designed so that it can be taken apart for ease of cleaning and it is really easy to put back together. 


Duothirst is a joy to hold due to the ergonomic shape and size of the bottle. It fits great in your hand and can easily be held at any point. 









Using Duothirst couldn't be easier. 
Simply fill the bottle halves with the drinks of
your choice, then twist the top part of the lid to click into one of four
possible positions. The first and third positions select the individual bottle
halves, whilst the second and fourth positions allow access to both bottle
halves at the same time.
So whether you want to have one, two, or a
mixture of two drinks Duothirst lets you decide.




You can choose the Duothirst that is perfect for your taste and style.

<p> </p>
<p>To make sure that you always have a working hearing aid, each OoshEars package includes two spare swappable batteries. The charging case has special sockets for charging these spare batteries, so you always have a pair of batteries ready to go.</p>
<p>We estimate that each battery will last for 3 hours while streaming music, and the whole day in the hearing aids mode.</p>
</div><h3> </h3><h3>Extended Frequency Range</h3><p>A healthy hearing range is from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. But most hearing aids augment hearing only up to 6 or 8 kHz. Why? Because that's the range of speech. Which is fine if all you care about is understanding speech. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621931245/vrrlpfekf2kolt96imam.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We care a lot about understanding speech. That's why we have noise reduction, feedback cancellation and other advanced algorithms. But we also care greatly about hearing music, animals, birds and the rest of the world! So we designed OoshEars to augment hearing up to at least 10 kHz. And we really hope we can go even higher, up to 12 or even 14 kHz (we are still testing the highest range that's feasible).</p><h3> </h3><h3>Noise Reduction</h3><p>Hearing well in noisy environments such as restaurants or busy streets is one of the key challenges for hard of hearing individuals. OoshEars comes with several technologies to help you hear better in the presence of noise:</p><p><strong>Digital Noise Reduction</strong> - each hearing aid comes with two microphones, an omnidirectional one and a front facing one. This enables OoshEars to detect and differentiate speech from background noise, and to amplify only the speech.</p><p><strong>Active Noise Cancellation</strong> - when your OoshEars are streaming music or phone calls, the background noises are cancelled out. This requires that you use a closed dome.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Domes</h3><p>OoshEars come with 2 types of domes: open and closed. You can choose which ones you prefer, each have their own advantages.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621544844/by35lngxa8schdvkvlod.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Open domes let sound through so they feel a bit more natural. Closed domes block sound, so they protect your ears from loud sounds, allow better noise reduction, but they may make your own voice sound a bit weird. You can swap domes at any time.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Who are OoshEars for</h3><p>OoshEars are for mentally able adults with a mild to moderate (up to 55 db HL) hearing loss. Configuring and controlling OoshEars requires an iPhone or an Android smartphone.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Are OoshEars safe?</h3><p>Yes. There are many safety features built in to OoshEars:</p><ol>
<li>When you first put in your OoshEars, the app will ask you several questions to make sure that your hearing loss is simple and straightforward. For example, it will ask if you have any pain in your ears, or if your hearing loss is sudden or unilateral. In suspect cases the app will recommend that you see an audiologist.</li>
<li>If OoshEars hearing test detects that your hearing loss is larger than supported, it will recommend that your see an audiologist.</li>
<li>OoshEars have peak output (maximum loudness) same as common earbuds (around 110 db SPL).</li>
<li>OoshEars hearing test includes testing for your loudness discomfort level (LDL) and adjusting the settings to make sure you are always comfortable.</li>
<li>OoshEars uses WDRC channels for sound amplification that intelligently shift all sounds into your hearing range without being too loud.</li>
<li>OoshEars tracks duration and loudness of sounds, and if the sound environment is too loud for too long it will show a warning.</li>
<li>OoshEars are built with premium reliable components.</li>
<li>OoshEars are first tested in our lab during each design iteration. Then they are worn and tested by our own team members with hearing loss (we eat our own dog food). Then each manufacturing stage has to pass Quality Assurance stage. Then OoshEars have to pass strict certification and testing by an independent lab.</li>

If you try to buy hearing aids today, your choices would be either very expensive full featured ones (average price of hearing aids is $4600), or bare bones cheap ones.Where are the hearing aids for the rest of us? Hearing aids that work well in noisy places, that are comfortable to wear, that can stream phone calls and music, that look good? And hopefully priced less than a car! OoshEars design prototype OoshEars are our answer. OoshEars are affordable full featured hearing aids. How is this possible?The answer is in our Self Fit technology. OoshEars are made for mild & moderate hearing loss. Majority of hearing loss cases are straightforward and uncomplicated. Fitting hearing aids can be done with technology. OoshEars use our custom Self Fit technology for precise fitting. This saves thousands of dollars in cost that we pass on to you as savings. OoshEars design prototype with a bundled smartphone app OoshEars are packed with premium features usually found only in very expensive hearing aids: custom fitting, Bluetooth 5 dual-mode, aptX streaming, extended hearing range, rechargeable batteries, 16 WDRC, omni & directional microphones, noise reduction, feedback cancellation, on-device controls, smartphone app control, unlimited custom programs. Self FitThe key feature of OoshEars hearing aids is Self Fit technology. Here is how it works:The first time you put OoshEars in your ears, the bundled smartphone app will ask you to go to a quiet place to take a quick hearing test (a pure tone audiometry test, similar to what is used in commercial audiometers). Taking a hearing test with the OoshEars mobile app The test will configure OoshEars to your unique hearing (using 16 WDRC - wide dynamic range channels). But that's not all. For an even better fit, you will also have full access to adjust the settings* at each frequency.So for example, you might visit a noisy restaurant where the sound of clanking plates is unbearably loud. You would simply open the app, lower the 8 kHz slider until everything sounds great, and save the new config as a stored program for future use in noisy restaurants.Or you might be in a meeting room with acoustics that dampens high frequencies making it hard for you to understand speech. You would simply open the app, and increase the 4 - 8 kHz sliders until you hear well again.Any time you feel your hearing has changed, you can quickly re-fit OoshEars. For example, someone with Meniere's disease whose hearing loss changes daily, can re-fit his OoshEars each morning in 5 minutes.  Our smartphone app will remind you at certain intervals to re-fit your hearing aids. It's quick, easy and convenient.* You have full access to manually adjust each WDRC channel. WDRC channels are what makes hearing aids so helpful. Unlike simpler EQ controls that one may find in some personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), WDRC channels don't just make the sounds louder, but also help intelligibility. Comfortable Stylish DesignFinal design, - what OoshEars will look like after manufacturing OoshEars are designed to be comfortable to wear the whole day. Comfortable if you fall asleep in them, or wear a helmet over them. We make sure OoshEars stay in place when you run, or jump, or do yoga handstands.OoshEars are designed to look stylish. From color, to shape, to materials, OoshEars enhance your looks. Bluetooth Streaming Music and VoiceOoshEars support dual mode Bluetooth 5 (Classic and Low Energy). That means you can connect directly to your iPhone, Android, TV or car.OoshEars also support AptX Adaptive, a modern codec for HD music streaming. AptX Adaptive is an evolution of AptX and AptX HD supporting up to 420 kbps.  Rechargeable Swappable BatteriesLet's face it, rechargeable batteries are much better than single use batteries.

<h3>Introducing Alma Retreat</h3>
<p>Alma means “nourishing"" or ""kind” in Latin and “soul” in Portuguese and Spanish, and that captures the essence of our purpose: we want to provide retreats and solutions that nourish the soul and inspire our guests and members to positively change their lives.</p>
<p>Our franchise boutique concept is aimed at adding value and purpose to the usual standard hospitality offering of accommodation and food by providing rich and inspirational content for the Heart, Mind and Body. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497099087/nokgv3mjk4caqrdekxsw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497099692/kcdbdbeinzx1yanhepks.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>All our products and supplies are carefully handpicked and responsibly sourced to support sustainability and fair trade. Furthermore, we are committed to donate 10% of our future profits to help educate and feed children around the world. </p>
<p>We are also developing an app and digital platform making sure people around the world can benefit from the knowledge we harvest. The app is also aimed to support our retreat guests sticking to new found resolutions and making their own vision a reality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497099922/p2ievmcbsr0q7t6yhhxh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>Our vision is to help our guests and members on their journey towards achieving goals, by creating distinct places where they can escape daily routines to find peace and inspiration, and accompanying them with an innovative digital platform to keep improving everyday life.</p>
<p>By choosing to support our vision, you will help creating a platform and unique places where people come together, get inspired, find motivation, have fun, develop and grow whilst helping other people around the world. </p>
<p><strong>You are essential to make our vision a reality - thank you for your contribution.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Concept</h3>
<p>Imagine escaping the stress and rush of the city to a beautiful boutique place rooted in nature to relax and de-stress. Imagine there you will not just meet new friends and build new networks but also learn new things you have never done before or always wanted to but never had the time or willpower to do so. A place that will help you to be more motivated for a healthier lifestyle, to potentially lose some weight and increase your energy levels. Imagine leaving happier and with a more peaceful mindset - equipped with tools and knowledge to keep you on track in your day-to-day life. And what if you had a digital application helping you to continuously improve? </p>
<p>Imagine you would have an escape like this near your city…today we are optimizing the operations in our first location. In a year from now, the next Alma Retreat might be opening near you. Alma is not about geography – by building a boutique concept that could be taken to many places and made be available everywhere and to everyone – also to you.</p>
<p>We aim to create fully sustainable locations, operated with renewable energies, using reclaimed and natural materials as well as simple yet artistic interiors supporting art and craft communities. All our products and supplies are handpicked, responsibly sourced and aim to support communities and causes we are passionate about, worldwide.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497100724/gqhc7tcvl8kfy7bxhyhr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our food is focused on healthy, organic farm-to-table approach in partnership with local producers. The vision is to develop small farms inside or adjacent to some of our locations to harvest knowledge and share the experience with our guests and partnering organizations around the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497101204/z9pw3pwxbbyic6rxtznm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our goal is to mature Alma in the United Arab Emirates, Germany and United Kingdom over the next two years. We want to have a positive impact and keep growing into new markets thereafter.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Story: Once upon a time or where did it all start?</h3>
<p>Our story began in 2010 – after living two years in Dubai our founder, Sarah, felt almost burned out and knew if she didn’t escape the city and ground herself she would probably collapse.</p>
<p>Her work as sales executive included regular flights to Africa or the Middle East, late night meetings and calls and 60-70 hours of work a week with quarterly targets pressure.</p>
<p>Being stressed she started searching for escapes and found one in Sri Lanka: a 20-hut nature retreat with no warm water or electricity, but organic locally farmed food, bespoke Ayurveda treatments and excellent teachers. After one week, she felt like a new person and had not just much higher energy levels but also increased the motivation for her job.</p>
<p>That’s when the first idea of Alma was born:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nature Escapes near major cities so people can switch off from their daily and stressful routines</li>
<li>Inspiration for the <strong>Mind</strong> through diverse methods including our own library, knowledgeable people and activities like meditation and courses</li>
<li>Fitness and healthy food options to nourish and detox our <strong>Body</strong>
</li>
<li>Art classes, music, and community environment to open our <strong>Heart</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, a retreat rather than a resort designed to “escape” from our daily routines and feel inspired to search and find new possibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Story: Where we are now?</h3>
<p>The Alma story started with the idea of one person, but Alma would not be what it is today if it was not for the friends and supporters along the way. We opened our first location in February 2017 and used the first season as a proof of concept to gain feedback and improve.</p>

<p>Alma is built from the people for the people – and if everybody gives a little bit, the future vision will be a reality, thanks to you!</p>
<p>Today Alma is led by a passionate team representing unity by diversity and all geared towards the one objective: motivate and inspire our guests while we continually improve. Unity by diversity is not just a phrase – inspired by Sivandana Yoga – we truly believe in equality of people and respect anyone and everyone’s believes and cultures. We are proud to say that even in our short time of operation our place provided a home away from home for spiritual groups, art and dance workshops, healthy and sustainable living retreats and eight fully booked signature weekend retreats including some corporate ones. See some of our guest reviews on our <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/iamalmaretreat/reviews/?ref=page_internal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g298063-d12282237-Reviews-Alma_Retreat-Ras_Al_Khaimah_Emirate_of_Ras_Al_Khaimah.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TripAdvisor</a></strong> pages.</p>
<p>This beautiful place here is just the start – we are currently working on more locations so that our guests and members can explore different experiences. Complementing our retreat, the digital app (IamAlma) being developed is designed to motivate our guests to continue the good deeds.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WE ARE ALMA</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The united colors of Alma: 10 countries, 5 continents, ages ranging from 25 to 55, each individual with unique experiences and skills – one team, one passion: making a difference!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Flor: </strong>Our Flor is the silent force behind keeping our place nice and tidy. She is shy on the outside but you know what they say about silent waters – she is very passionate about family, helping others and personal development.</p>
<p><strong>Sergio (Member of the Leadership Team): </strong>The Alma Director of Development and Operations comes with over 15 years’ experience in hospitality across the world. With a pure Spanish pedigree, Sergio is passionate and fiery by nature and Alma helps him to use those qualities for good and understand the best way to control and learn through different techniques. Sergio strongly believes one's overall health and wellness isn't just physical but also mental.  “<i>Alma's lifestyle is an idea that will help people to feel better about themselves in many ways. Alma is niche with huge potential for growth and making a difference in people’s lives.”</i></p>
<p><strong>Salma (Member of the Leadership Team): </strong>Professionally, Salma has spent the last 11 years of her career with Microsoft helping government-related entities and enterprises realize their maximum potential by leveraging innovation &amp; technology. Realizing that people are the core of any transformation be it personal, organizational or political, she became interested in psychology. Having studied psychology from Harvard Extension School, she is now deeply involved in spiritual psychology, healing and philanthropy with a passion for the betterment of the society and human experience. She's involved in multiple charities and is equally passionate about bringing Alma home to the less privileged “<i>so that we can bring mindfulness, conscious living and healing to all - the promise of Alma!”</i></p>
<p><strong>Sarah (Founder &amp; CEO): </strong>The Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Alma Retreat spent her last 17 years working in large IT organizations and developing strategies for emerging markets. In her travels to Africa she became passionate about making a difference and driving with impact.

<p>It has been a challenge so far to find the right long-term location in the United Arab Emirates as we seek to transport a feeling rooted in nature, however some options have arise and we are confident with your help the next version of Alma in the United Arab Emirates will be even better. In parallel, we have already identified an ideal plot for our first location in Germany and are actively negotiating the land lease and planning permission with the relevant local authorities.</p>
<p>The planning of and the physical construction of the properties is always a challenge, but nothing we dread about taking on. We are confident the lessons learned during the development of our first property in Ras Al Khaimah coupled with the breadth and depth of construction experience Sergio brings to the leadership team, will keep this aspect of the project on rails.</p>
<p>The implementation of our vision is a multi-year project and will require intensive capital expenditure and investments in the first few years, so we are unlikely to be cash-flow positive before three years into the plan. As a result, giving back through direct charitable donations from our profits may take a while but will start happening as soon as we turn the corner in terms of profitability. In the meantime, we will continuously and actively work with our partners and suppliers to ensure we are having a positive impact on communities and causes we are passionate about.</p>
<p>Developing ground-breaking software solutions are often complex processes, requiring very talented teams supported by meticulous functional requirements planning and architectural design, as well as skillful project management. Our leadership team has multiple decades of combined IT strategy and software development expertise, enviably positioning us to successfully lead the development of the digital platform and application we envision.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing Alma Retreat
Alma means “nourishing"" or ""kind” in Latin and “soul” in Portuguese and Spanish, and that captures the essence of our purpose: we want to provide retreats and solutions that nourish the soul and inspire our guests and members to positively change their lives.
Our franchise boutique concept is aimed at adding value and purpose to the usual standard hospitality offering of accommodation and food by providing rich and inspirational content for the Heart, Mind and Body. 


All our products and supplies are carefully handpicked and responsibly sourced to support sustainability and fair trade. Furthermore, we are committed to donate 10% of our future profits to help educate and feed children around the world. 
We are also developing an app and digital platform making sure people around the world can benefit from the knowledge we harvest. The app is also aimed to support our retreat guests sticking to new found resolutions and making their own vision a reality.

 
Our Vision
Our vision is to help our guests and members on their journey towards achieving goals, by creating distinct places where they can escape daily routines to find peace and inspiration, and accompanying them with an innovative digital platform to keep improving everyday life.
By choosing to support our vision, you will help creating a platform and unique places where people come together, get inspired, find motivation, have fun, develop and grow whilst helping other people around the world. 
You are essential to make our vision a reality - thank you for your contribution.
 
Our Concept
Imagine escaping the stress and rush of the city to a beautiful boutique place rooted in nature to relax and de-stress. Imagine there you will not just meet new friends and build new networks but also learn new things you have never done before or always wanted to but never had the time or willpower to do so. A place that will help you to be more motivated for a healthier lifestyle, to potentially lose some weight and increase your energy levels. Imagine leaving happier and with a more peaceful mindset - equipped with tools and knowledge to keep you on track in your day-to-day life. And what if you had a digital application helping you to continuously improve? 
Imagine you would have an escape like this near your city…today we are optimizing the operations in our first location. In a year from now, the next Alma Retreat might be opening near you. Alma is not about geography – by building a boutique concept that could be taken to many places and made be available everywhere and to everyone – also to you.
We aim to create fully sustainable locations, operated with renewable energies, using reclaimed and natural materials as well as simple yet artistic interiors supporting art and craft communities. All our products and supplies are handpicked, responsibly sourced and aim to support communities and causes we are passionate about, worldwide.

Our food is focused on healthy, organic farm-to-table approach in partnership with local producers. The vision is to develop small farms inside or adjacent to some of our locations to harvest knowledge and share the experience with our guests and partnering organizations around the world.

Our goal is to mature Alma in the United Arab Emirates, Germany and United Kingdom over the next two years. We want to have a positive impact and keep growing into new markets thereafter.
 
The Story: Once upon a time or where did it all start?
Our story began in 2010 – after living two years in Dubai our founder, Sarah, felt almost burned out and knew if she didn’t escape the city and ground herself she would probably collapse.
Her work as sales executive included regular flights to Africa or the Middle East, late night meetings and calls and 60-70 hours of work a week with quarterly targets pressure.
Being stressed she started searching for escapes and found one in Sri Lanka: a 20-hut nature retreat with no warm water or electricity, but organic locally farmed food, bespoke Ayurveda treatments and excellent teachers. After one week, she felt like a new person and had not just much higher energy levels but also increased the motivation for her job.
That’s when the first idea of Alma was born:

Nature Escapes near major cities so people can switch off from their daily and stressful routines
Inspiration for the Mind through diverse methods including our own library, knowledgeable people and activities like meditation and courses
Fitness and healthy food options to nourish and detox our Body

Art classes, music, and community environment to open our Heart


Basically, a retreat rather than a resort designed to “escape” from our daily routines and feel inspired to search and find new possibilities.
 
The Story: Where we are now?
The Alma story started with the idea of one person, but Alma would not be what it is today if it was not for the friends and supporters along the way. We opened our first location in February 2017 and used the first season as a proof of concept to gain feedback and improve.

Alma is built from the people for the people – and if everybody gives a little bit, the future vision will be a reality, thanks to you!
Today Alma is led by a passionate team representing unity by diversity and all geared towards the one objective: motivate and inspire our guests while we continually improve. Unity by diversity is not just a phrase – inspired by Sivandana Yoga – we truly believe in equality of people and respect anyone and everyone’s believes and cultures. We are proud to say that even in our short time of operation our place provided a home away from home for spiritual groups, art and dance workshops, healthy and sustainable living retreats and eight fully booked signature weekend retreats including some corporate ones. See some of our guest reviews on our Facebook and TripAdvisor pages.
This beautiful place here is just the start – we are currently working on more locations so that our guests and members can explore different experiences. Complementing our retreat, the digital app (IamAlma) being developed is designed to motivate our guests to continue the good deeds.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What is CuPure?</h2>
<p>CuPure is a simple yet high tech way of face masks. Many studies have proven that coronavirus can live on surfaces like plastic, steel, wood, etc., for 3 to 9 days. Copper is a material which doesn't allow the bacteria/ virus to live and stay active for more than 4 hours. Find the study here - <a href=""https://mbio.asm.org/content/6/6/e01697-15.full"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://mbio.asm.org/content/6/6/e01697-15.full</a></p>

<p>Copper has natural antifungal, antimicrobial, antibacterial and antiviral properties. See Wikipedia link here -  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper</a></p>
<p>Copper doesn't kill these pathogens; it destroys them right down to their structures which help it reproduce.

<p>After learning from all these studies, we've come up with CuPure. CuPure is an N95 mask with the exterior shell made of copper blended fabric which allows the mask to remain pathogen-free always. This copper layer is the outermost part of this face mask. It is comfortable to wear and easy to breathe through. The inside of the mask will have the user's bacterial or viral ecosystem and is harmless. It is the outside of the mask that has foreign bacteria or viruses from which the user needs to be protected from. The outer copper layer will render the mask harmless to touch and avoid recontamination. Further, the user can expose the mask to a daily dose of a few hours of sunlight to decontaminate the mask for reuse. Please read the instructions on how to use CuPure very carefully. Since CuPure has a copper mesh exterior it has 5 times the surface area of a flat layer of the mask. Disposable masks pollute the environment, and in the circumstances in which everyone needs a mask, imagine millions of masks getting disposed. CuPure can be reused and will last longer and pollute less. CuPure is also more durable than the regular masks out there due to its strong copper fabric structure. If you use masks often, then we recommend using 2 CuPure masks alternatively so that each one gets enough time to work its magic. </p>

<p>WHO recommends the usage of masks like N95 or N99 during the outbreaks of viruses like Coronavirus, Flu, SARS, MERS, etc., Every country is promoting the use of face masks to protect its healthy population hence avoiding the spread of these viruses. CuPure is different because when you use a regular mask all the bacteria, germs, fungus, etc., builds up on the exterior of the mask and lives on that surface for a very long time (3-9 days) hence helping the virus spread everywhere. CuPure will not let that happen as the copper shell will react with the bacteria and kill all the bacteria, virus, fungus. Please read the WHO guidelines on how to wear and remove masks and how to protect yourself from COVID19.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How to ensure the mask fits?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Positive pressure check - </b>Hold the edges of the face mask firmly and blow from inside. If you feel any leaks then readjust the strap or the metal clip</li>

CuPure is a simple yet high tech way of face masks. Many studies have proven that coronavirus can live on surfaces like plastic, steel, wood, etc., for 3 to 9 days. Copper is a material which doesn't allow the bacteria/ virus to live and stay active for more than 4 hours. Find the study here - https://mbio.asm.org/content/6/6/e01697-15.full
 

Copper has natural antifungal, antimicrobial, antibacterial and antiviral properties. See Wikipedia link here -  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper
Copper doesn't kill these pathogens; it destroys them right down to their structures which help it reproduce. Professor Bill Keevil, University of Southampton article here - https://www.fastcompany.com/90476550/copper-kills-coronavirus-why-arent-our-surfaces-covered-in-it
 
           This is what copper does.
After learning from all these studies, we've come up with CuPure. CuPure is an N95 mask with the exterior shell made of copper blended fabric which allows the mask to remain pathogen-free always. This copper layer is the outermost part of this face mask. It is comfortable to wear and easy to breathe through. The inside of the mask will have the user's bacterial or viral ecosystem and is harmless. It is the outside of the mask that has foreign bacteria or viruses from which the user needs to be protected from. The outer copper layer will render the mask harmless to touch and avoid recontamination. Further, the user can expose the mask to a daily dose of a few hours of sunlight to decontaminate the mask for reuse. Please read the instructions on how to use CuPure very carefully. Since CuPure has a copper mesh exterior it has 5 times the surface area of a flat layer of the mask. Disposable masks pollute the environment, and in the circumstances in which everyone needs a mask, imagine millions of masks getting disposed. CuPure can be reused and will last longer and pollute less. CuPure is also more durable than the regular masks out there due to its strong copper fabric structure. If you use masks often, then we recommend using 2 CuPure masks alternatively so that each one gets enough time to work its magic. 
 

 
Why CuPure?

Useful for the current outbreak of Coronavirus.
Can be used for indoor and outdoor activities.
Easy to use, one size fits all

Washable and reusable
Inexpensive yet effective
Copper layer which destroys all germs on its surface on its own

 
Layers of CuPure
  
 

On regular surfaces

On metallic surfaces

 

 

WHO recommends the usage of masks like N95 or N99 during the outbreaks of viruses like Coronavirus, Flu, SARS, MERS, etc., Every country is promoting the use of face masks to protect its healthy population hence avoiding the spread of these viruses. CuPure is different because when you use a regular mask all the bacteria, germs, fungus, etc., builds up on the exterior of the mask and lives on that surface for a very long time (3-9 days) hence helping the virus spread everywhere. CuPure will not let that happen as the copper shell will react with the bacteria and kill all the bacteria, virus, fungus. Please read the WHO guidelines on how to wear and remove masks and how to protect yourself from COVID19. All your doubts can be resolved here and do read the WHO guidelines here -  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks

 
Features :

N95
One Size Fit All
6 layer design
The Copper exterior which sanitises itself
Washable
Comfortable design
Wide double strap securing system
Reusable
Foldable flat design

CuPure is inexpensive and effective. CuPure is the new definition of the face mask. CuPure is a revolutionary idea, and its cost makes it even more affordable to all people of the world. We want to deliver CuPure to everyone.

Care Instructions :

Machine Wash Cold Delicate Cycle with Colours.
Tumble Dry on Low Heat.
DO NOT IRON. DO NOT BLEACH
Can be hand washed
Soak in water before washing
Pass water from inside several times before soaking

 
Handling face masks is not easy; here are some images that would help you understand the way of using masks. (Courtesy of WHO)



 
How to ensure the mask fits?


Positive pressure check - Hold the edges of the face mask firmly and blow from inside. If you feel any leaks then readjust the strap or the metal clip

Negative pressure check - Again hold the edges then suck, if you feel any gaps you know what to do.

 
Why are masks important? Here's an article of masks for all and what governments want the citizens to do. https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data
Read this WHO report to know about how to live in a situation like the Coronavirus and what to remember. Find the report here - https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331693/WHO-2019-nCov-IPC_Masks-2020.3-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y
This article tells us about all the types of face masks available and what their particular purpose is. To protect yourself, you need to wear a tight-fitting mask. The exterior of the mask gets exposed to the outside hence making them one time use. Know the differences here -  https://www.healthline.com/health/coronavirus-mask

<p>The main carry bag (including the two balloon wheels) is
about 48 x 22 x 20 inches (122 x 56 x 51 cm) and fits nicely in an SUV. I did
pack the wheels separately when I rented a Camry, and that works just fine. In
order to check the Trail Chair as regular-sized luggage for the airlines, we provide
a separate carry bag for the balloon tires.</p>

<p>The frame weighs 30 Lbs. (13.6 Kg). The balloon wheels
with axel plates weigh 15 Lbs.  (6.8 Kg).
The BMX wheels with axel plates weigh 7 Lbs. lbs (3.2 Kg). So all together in
the carry bag, the trail chair weighs 52 Lbs.  (23.6 Kg).</p>
<h4>How big is it when completely
open?</h4>
<p>Overall width is 38.5 in (98 cm) with balloon wheels and 25.5
in (65 cm) with BMX wheels. The turning radius is 56 in (142 cm). The distance
from the front bumper to the backrest in the upright position is 70 in (178 cm).

<h4>What is the warranty?</h4>
<p>First of all, your trail chair will arrive defect free. If
you have any problems with the components or with shipping damage, please
contact us right away. Since this is a “rough use” outdoor product: under
normal circumstances you will get dings and smudges. Please do not over fill
the tires; they need to be soft for the trail and to provide a smooth ride. We
warranty the manufactured parts of the trail chair from 1 year of receipt. We
will carry replacement parts; please let us know how we can help.</p>
<h4>When can I get one?</h4>
<p>We are planning to ship within 90 days from the IndieGoGo
campaign. Our prototype (the one used in the videos) proves the functionality
and the tooling requirements. We will post regular production updates on this
site at on our web page <a href=""http://www.abilitysport.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.abilitysport.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.abilitysport.net</a>
.</p>
<h4>How can I maintain the trail
chair?</h4>
<p>Salt, sand, and grit are not good for moving parts. We recommend
that you hose off the chair after heavy use. The wheel bearings are sealed
industry standard stainless steel and should not be a problem. If the front
wheel assembly is sticky, try some soap (it worked for me).</p>
<h4>Who do I call if I have a
problem?</h4>
<p>We like email, a lot. And prefer that you email your
question and comment (and a good time to call you). Please contact <a href=""mailto:info@abilitysport.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@abilitysport.net</a> . However, you
may also reach us at (800) 345-1645 during West Coast business hours.</p>
<h4><b>Can you ship this overseas?</b></h4>
<p>Yes. But it is difficult to quote you a price until we
know if you want both sets of wheels and where you live. Please send us an
email with your order information and mailing address to <a href=""mailto:info@abilitysport.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@abilitysport.net</a> and we will get
you the best shipping price we can find.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","The Ability Sport Off-Road Mobility chair will let you take that beach vacation and get into the water. Go for a ride into the woods and smell the trees. Extend your travel range and get refreshed by the natural world.
If you need physical assistance to move through your
home, your neighborhood, and to your appointments; maybe your leisure time can
be turned up a notch.



We need to sell 100 chairs in the next 30 days. Help us deliver this product. Purchase yours now to reserve this low introductory price for 2015.
We have designed this transport with two sets of wheels so
that your adventures are no longer limited to the sidewalk. Balloon tires
exchange quickly with the BMX wheels so the Off-Road Mobility chair your is all-season
alternative.


We
have been making medical durable equipment for the past 10 years. When we looked at the
cumbersome units known as “beach wheelchairs”; we realized that we could make
significant improvements in function and flexibility.


The Accessible Recreation world extends from the beach to the mountains. Where ever you want to play next; surf, trail, marsh or desert. We even took our sample to the snow covered slopes around Lake Tahoe to see how the balloon wheel float on the snow! This Off-Road Mobility chair will take you there.

When we bring a product to market: the buck stops with me.
This is why I work long-term with trusted suppliers. I get to know every nook
and cranny (i.e. every bent and punched tube, every surface of the injection
molded parts, all of the sliding tolerances) of the products we produce. 
We
manufacture and test this trail chair like every other FDA medical transport
chair; so that you can be sure of getting the quality and durability you expect.


This IndieGoGo campaign allows us to find an audience for
our product. Pre-sales are discounted from MSRP because you are the first
movers and will enjoy the Off-Road Mobility chair before it goes to the retail
market. We can offer these great prices because we are direct; factory to you.
