</div></div>","Many people underestimate the benefits of a professional massage gun. NEX Pro speeds up muscle recovery and helps athletes push themselves to their limits in each training session, with the advantage of not slowing down by cramps or muscle pain caused by training. 

From product development to creation, we work with athletes and professionals to support your needs and provide the ultimate wellness experience. Professional athletes make no compromises, nor do we.





 
Our previous campaign of OYeet NEX has been funded over $360K and loved by 3000+ backers around the world. Now our team is back and bringing you the OYeet NEX Pro with more power, more amplitude, and more professional attachments in an elevated, premium package. Below are the feedbacks from the early supporters of NEX Pro:

Our goal is simple: We want to build the best professional massage gun on the market.

OYeet NEX Pro reduces inflammation and muscle tension by 50% faster, breaks up those pesky knots after hard training & increases the blood flow of muscle tissue into the circulation for quick recovery, and speeds up rehab within 2 minutes.

It is capable to break up scar tissue and adhesions to restore your muscles and provides an exceptional percussive massage & reactivates all your muscles and keeps you moving every day with a 50% deeper tissue relaxation.
OYeet NEX Pro is delivering the best massage performance on the market in the most compact package for only a fraction of competitors’ prices.
Powered by NEXPower™ Technology, the latest high torque 98.8W NP38 motor strikes 40% deeper into the skin, up to 3500 PPM at 50 times per second. Powerful cores bring professional technology as the maximum force of 60 lb penetrates your deep tissue at a depth of 12.55 mm.

Sports science research has guided us in choosing the strength of 60lbs of force, enough to ease the pain but not too much to exacerbate the issue and give you the control you need to recover faster.



The heavy-duty dual shafts in NEX Pro are built with Aircraft-grade aluminum to ensure long-lasting performance and minimize unnecessary vibrations. Made of engineered fiberglass, the handle is fully coated with liquid silicone, which is soft to touch and comfortable to grip.


Powerful performance does not have to be accompanied by a bulky structure. With a composition that is 50% lighter and 40% smaller, the NEX Pro is the most compact design ever on the market and features sports engineering at its finest.

We know that strength and speed are indispensable, but they would not matter if there were no attachments for your needs. Built of 100% metal and durable high-density plastic, the 8 professional attachments are designed for athletic performance, pain relief, and injury rehabilitation.
Designed for life on the go, the NEX Pro comes with all 8 professional attachments neatly packed in a TSA-approved premium travel case. Smaller than a book, it's the new essential that easily fits into your gym bag or handbag.
Our team believes that the massage sessions should not be noisy and disturbing like other massage devices with more than 60 dB. With this in mind, we have developed OYeet NEX Pro at only 45 dB - allowing you can relax and recover faster.
Whether at home or in public, the practical silence will not disturb anyone or yourself.
By improving the industrial design of the NP38 motor with NEXPower™ technology, we have significantly increased runtime by 40% compared to any other device on the market.

Rest assured that the NEX Pro has a long battery life of up to 240 minutes. With each charge of NEX Pro and 10 mins of massage time every working day, you get up to a month of massage time to enjoy more sessions.

To charge your NEX Pro, simply plug the device into the USB cable, and the ring will light up to notify you that the NEX Pro is ready to use.
The smart NEX Pro also has a cordless charging stand that features the sophisticated design of a non-slip suction cup on the bottom to secure itself on the desk. With our unique built-in sensor technology that provides visual feedback, you can get feedback and information during the massage process to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of each massage session.


Equipped with 4 speed modes from 1400ppm to 3500ppm, it allows you to choose your desired power for the massage of warming up or recovery. Loop mode starts at 1400ppm and gradually increases to 3500ppm before the circulation continues, and you can enjoy the different power without any distractions.

Experience the powerful and ultra-portable OYeet NEX Pro, the high-performance treatment in an elevated, premium-quality design. We have designed the NEX Pro that in such a way that it is not only ergonomic and easy to use but also extremely easy to control due to its lightweight form and one-button operation.


Discover our step-by-step, personalized wellness routine, which is intuitive and easy to explore with a simple swipe of a thumb.

I purchased 2 Luft Cube here a while back. I love it. It has helped tremendously with how my family and I breathe when we sleep at night and during the day, especially since we’re inside the house almost all the time. I have it on almost all day long, switching between low and high throughout the day but it’s on all the time. Thank you for creating this amazing product.–Alice Jen | Canada



I received my Luft Cube a couple weeks ago, and putting it next to the cat litter box has made me a believer. I used to be able to smell it every time I walked into the large living area where the litter box was housed, but no longer. It has been running 24/7 since I received it and no problems so far. I personally find the fan very quiet, and the lighting unobtrusive. I am very happy with my backing, thank you!–Kendall McCarthy | United States



Thank you Luft cube team! I have used the cube for around 2 weeks already. The very next day, my wife stop her every morning uncontrollable sneezing due to sinus condition. She has been sneezing for years and now it has stopped for the past 2 weeks since starting using the Luft cube. Thank you very much from.–Royston Teo | Singapore



Love these things! Use 1 at home in the bedroom, use 1 in the office at my desk and I gave the other as a gift. The Luft Cube has exceeded all expectations. Quiet, powerful, efficient, portable and high quality. Looking forward to ordering more for more areas and more gifts. Thank you.–Michael Johnson | United States



Had a pair of these for about 2-3 weeks now, and must say I’m pretty happy with them. Wis-per quiet even on high. And they have helped clean the air in my personal space quite well!–Phil Dallek | United States

The Pod uses <strong>three</strong> (yes, three!) UV-C LEDs to get rid of those hidden nasties in your water. The LEDs are positioned to <strong>maximise the volume of water and bottle surface area</strong> the UV-C light reaches.</p><h3>Pure Light at 275nm.</h3><p>Each of Nuvoe's LEDs emits light at a peak wavelength of <strong>275nm</strong>, the optimal frequency for water-based UV-C applications. 275nm is also the optimal wavelength to target the most common bio-contaminant offenders found in our water bottles.</p><p>Why is 275nm more effective than other UV wavelengths? Other wavelengths either target the cell as a whole or specific compounds in the cell. UV-C specifically targets nucleic acids and DNA and <strong>requires 1,000x less power</strong> to achieve the same effect, and as such, are <strong>much safer</strong> and <strong>more efficient</strong> to use.</p><p>Other UV-C systems use 280nm based LEDs but Nuvoe's LEDs shifts the peak wavelength down slightly from 280nm to 275nm resulting in up to <strong>25% improvement in efficiency!</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607328419/huuxbhgl5cx2n9nqiigp.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Chemical-free, filter-free &amp; no single-use consumables!</h3><p>UV-C <strong>does not rely on chemicals or filtration materials</strong>, and can therefore be used <strong>effectively </strong>and <strong>safely</strong>. We're tired of the onerous repetitive cost and waste of single-use consumables and subscriptions. This means Nuvoe is an all-in-one, one-off-purchase solution.</p><h3>Next-gen LED materials.</h3><p>Old UV-C systems used mercury to generate UV-C light. Nuvoe's LEDs are completely <strong>mercury-free</strong>. The core of our LEDs are made from a <strong>bio-compatible, non-toxic</strong> gallium nitride (GaN) which is often used in medical devices like implantable electrodes.</p><h3>100% Ozone-free.</h3><p>UV light at very small wavelengths can produce ozone but Nuvoe's spectrum <strong>never falls below 250nm</strong>. Ozone can only be produced at wavelengths below 185nm meaning it's <strong>completely ozone-free! </strong>(Ironically, UV-C at 275nm breaks the third oxygen atom that's attached to any ozone, converting it back to straight oxygen!)</p><h3>Positioned to perform.</h3><p>Nuvoe is positioned in the <strong>middle of the bottle</strong> allowing the UV-C to work middle-out. Nuvoe can therefore achieve <strong>greater efficiency and coverage</strong> compared to being in the lid or the base of the bottle. This has the added advantage of also<strong> cleaning under the lid.</strong></p><h3>The power of 3.</h3><p>Yes, two is better than one, but three is better than two! The Nuvoe Pod uses <strong>three UV-C LEDs</strong> to ensure that the UV-C light reaches everywhere inside your bottle.</p><h3>Food-safe materials &amp; IPX8 construction.</h3><p>Water is considered a food by the FDA and all contact materials should be classified as food-safe. All materials in the Nuvoe Pod (and Bottle) are <strong>food &amp; water-safe and BPA-free</strong>. The Pod is completely waterproof to the highest standard.</p><p> </p><h2>Testing aplenty.</h2><p>We've spent months refining our UV-C technology to ensure your Nuvoe Pod freshens your water and cleans your bottle day-in and day-out.</p><div>

Clean bottle. All it takes is a shake.Nuvoe Pod eliminates up to 99.9999% of bio-contamination by disrupting the nucleic acids and the structure of a cell's DNA. UV-C light is the new industry standard disinfection technology for hospital wards and high traffic public infrastructure and we have miniaturised this technology to a size that can fit inside your water bottle!Nuvoe purifies your water and cleans your bottle all day long, so your drinking water is as pure and fresh as it can be. Update (July 2021): Now with a fresh new lookWe have reworked the design of the Pod with a simpler, more elegant design for its upcoming release. Your bottle & water aren't as clean as you think.Water bottles are perfect incubators. They are dark and moist ecosystems where bio-contaminants thrive and grow.We know you wash your bottle - but guess what? Despite all that hard work - it's just not as clean as you think. Research shows that even with regular washing, 70% of refillable water bottles carry levels of bio-contamination above the FDA recommended limit for bottled water.In fact, despite chlorination the treated water out of the tap still carries low-levels of bio-contamination, and when you store that water in a dark, moist bottle and drink from it throughout the day it accumulates and grows in-between washes, feeding on the nutrients released from saliva! Even worse, backwash adds more contamination with every sip.It's a constant cycle that's impossible to stay on top of.The result? Your favourite water bottle gives off that nasty, funky smell and your water starts to develop an 'off' taste. Yuck!It's not pleasant. That's why we created Nuvoe.We take a much deeper look in this article. Meet Nuvoe.Small yet powerful, the Nuvoe Pod is a water purifier powered by UV-C light designed to live inside your water bottle. It purifies your water and cleans your bottle of bio-contamination while you're on-the-go or at home. Drink the freshest water from the cleanest bottle possible every minute of every day. Using Nuvoe is simple!Upgrade - Tape the Magnetic Anchor to the outside of your bottle and drop in the Nuvoe Pod. It will magnetically snap into place! You only need to do this once.Shake - Every time you refill, simply shake for 2 seconds to activate a cleaning cycle.That's it! Nuvoe will beep after 1 minute to let you know it finished purifying your water and cleaning your bottle.It's as easy as that - now you can enjoy purified, contamination free water from a bottle that won't smell. Your questions answered.Watch to learn more about how easy Nuvoe is to use! Treat your bottle.Nuvoe seamlessly fits into your lifestyle. Upgrade your bottle once and enjoy fresh-tasting water wherever you are and whatever you're doing.Nuvoe works with all the water bottle brands you would recognise - and even non-branded bottles too. Check our minimum size requirements at the bottom of the page. Constantly cleans. So you don't have to.Nuvoe automatically activates for a short cleaning cycle every two hours to prevent the build up of biofilm and any newly introduced bio-contaminants throughout the day. Gone is the daily hassle of having to regularly wash your bottle. Guaranteed freshness. Explore without worries.Traveling or want to drink water from a natural water-source? Activate Deep Clean by shaking your bottle for 4 seconds to start an extra-rigorous 3-minute cleaning cycle. Keep your favourite bottle.Nuvoe lets you upgrade your own water bottle! It is compatible with most wide-neck bottles and most bottle types. More than one bottle? Swap them out!Do you use a different bottle during the day and another for the gym or hiking? With additional Magnetic Anchors you can move the Pod amongst your bottles to always drink the cleanest water, no matter what you’re doing. Additional Magnetic Anchors are available as an add-on. One month's charge.You can charge your Pod using the supplied magnetic USB cable. One charge is good for 30 days of daily use. Like bottled water. Without the waste.Globally, more than 1 million plastic bottles are sold every minute and over 91% of these are not recycled. Nuvoe supports the sustainable switch to using a refillable water bottle, and makes sure you are drinking the freshest water possible all day long.Source: Nace T. We’re Now At A Million Plastic Bottles Per Minute - 91% Of Which Are Not Recycled. Forbes. Published July 26, 2017.  It doesn't stop there.Upgrade all your water containers.Nuvoe's small size, and easy to fit mounting system gives you so much choice on where you can use it! You can upgrade other water dispensing and storage devices around the home like filtered water pitchers, jugs & carafes, fridges with a dispensing water containers, and pet water accessories!Switch Nuvoe to Timer Mode and it will automatically turn on at a regular time interval to keep your water containers as clean as can be. Clean anything!UV-C light can clean more than just water! Nuvoe is not permanently attached to your water bottle so you can take it out and use it to de-contaminate more things around the house like your phone, keys, or face mask.Just attach Nuvoe inside any metallic tin with reflective internal surfaces, double tap the button to start a cleaning cycle and you're ready to go! Accessorise with a Nuvoe Bottle.Nuvoe bottles are specially designed to work with the Nuvoe Pod. They feature a built-in Magnetic Anchor, are vacuum insulated, come in a great variety of colours, and have a highly reflective internal surface to improve Nuvoe's ability to freshen your water and clean your bottle. You will be able to select your Nuvoe Bottle colour in the post-campaign survey. ColoursThe Nuvoe Pod & Magnetic Anchor upgrade will be available in Slate for all 'Nuvoe Pod' perks.The Nuvoe Pod & Bottle bundle comes in a great range of colours and feature a colour-matched Pod!Coloured Pods will only be available with the Bottle bundle. UV-C. How does it work?UV-C light is the new industry standard technology for hospitals and high traffic public infrastructure. We have miniaturised this technology to a size that can fit inside your water bottle!When shining UV-C light on bio-contaminants the light penetrates through cell walls disrupting nucleic acids and the structure of the cell's DNA. This leaves them unable to perform vital cellular functions, rendering them ineffective.We have taken this very same UV-C technology, optimised it and built it into the Nuvoe Pod. The Pod uses three (yes, three!) UV-C LEDs to get rid of those hidden nasties in your water. The LEDs are positioned to maximise the volume of water and bottle surface area the UV-C light reaches.Pure Light at 275nm.Each of Nuvoe's LEDs emits light at a peak wavelength of 275nm, the optimal frequency for water-based UV-C applications. 275nm is also the optimal wavelength to target the most common bio-contaminant offenders found in our water bottles.Why is 275nm more effective than other UV wavelengths? Other wavelengths either target the cell as a whole or specific compounds in the cell. UV-C specifically targets nucleic acids and DNA and requires 1,000x less power to achieve the same effect, and as such, are much safer and more efficient to use.Other UV-C systems use 280nm based LEDs but Nuvoe's LEDs shifts the peak wavelength down slightly from 280nm to 275nm resulting in up to 25% improvement in efficiency!Chemical-free, filter-free & no single-use consumables!UV-C does not rely on chemicals or filtration materials, and can therefore be used effectively and safely. We're tired of the onerous repetitive cost and waste of single-use consumables and subscriptions. This means Nuvoe is an all-in-one, one-off-purchase solution.Next-gen LED materials.Old UV-C systems used mercury to generate UV-C light. Nuvoe's LEDs are completely mercury-free. The core of our LEDs are made from a bio-compatible, non-toxic gallium nitride (GaN) which is often used in medical devices like implantable electrodes.100% Ozone-free.UV light at very small wavelengths can produce ozone but Nuvoe's spectrum never falls below 250nm. Ozone can only be produced at wavelengths below 185nm meaning it's completely ozone-free! (Ironically, UV-C at 275nm breaks the third oxygen atom that's attached to any ozone, converting it back to straight oxygen!)Positioned to perform.Nuvoe is positioned in the middle of the bottle allowing the UV-C to work middle-out. Nuvoe can therefore achieve greater efficiency and coverage compared to being in the lid or the base of the bottle. This has the added advantage of also cleaning under the lid.The power of 3.Yes, two is better than one, but three is better than two! The Nuvoe Pod uses three UV-C LEDs to ensure that the UV-C light reaches everywhere inside your bottle.Food-safe materials & IPX8 construction.Water is considered a food by the FDA and all contact materials should be classified as food-safe. All materials in the Nuvoe Pod (and Bottle) are food & water-safe and BPA-free. The Pod is completely waterproof to the highest standard. Testing aplenty.We've spent months refining our UV-C technology to ensure your Nuvoe Pod freshens your water and cleans your bottle day-in and day-out.

 
 
The hype is real! How is Nuvoe different? Take a closer look.Will Nuvoe work with my bottle?Your bottle needs to meet these two minimum size requirements to fit Nuvoe. Our Story.We love our refillable water bottles - we have one with us all the time - but they do come with their own annoyances & problems. We came across news articles & supporting papers that surprised us with how much bio-contamination lives inside our bottles and how municipal water isn't as clean as we think it is. We also hate that funky smell and 'off' taste that can slowly develop throughout the day no matter how much we rinse it out; and the daily chore of washing to keep the water tasting great does become tiresome. We wanted to design a product that upgrades our existing water bottle with self-cleaning super powers and keep us using our bottles every day knowing the water is as clean and fresh as it can be.The Nuvoe team has over 25 years combined experience delivering innovative technology solutions for start-ups in Australia and around the world and we are excited to bring this experience to our first Indiegogo campaign.We have deep expertise developing complex electronic devices for consumer and medical device markets. Coupled with our strong network of supply chain and manufacturing partners we are extremely confident we will deliver an outstanding product and experience.Supporting indigenous communities.Nuvoe is working with Kembla Corp which is owned by Mark Ella AM (Member of the Order of Australia).

You can easily enter meditating and deep relaxing states with the latest Neurowave Technology and breath coaching of the breathing light. To those who have snoring issues, DOZZ is designed to stop snores by stimulating your muscles around the throats. You can even track your sleep health record with the built-in app. Various sleep music also available to choose from to creates the right atmosphere for your healthy, restful sleep.  Many people suffering from depression, anxiety and stress may often experiences insomnia. The immediate concern is daytime sleepiness. A lack of energy can cause feelings of anxiety, depression, or irritation. Not only can it affect your performance at work or school, but too little sleep may also increase your risk for car accidents.     Let’s be honest here, you have probably tried every single sleeping remedy out there! You may even try seeking sleeping professionals, who charge you a very high-cost consultation fee. Sedatives and sleeping pills mask the underlying problems only and can also cause long-term damage to your brain. They can even come with a lot of adverse effects, including impaired memory, drowsiness, allergic reactions, and more. DOZZ will be your new solution that is affordable and completely safe for your body. It is drug-free, reliable and effective to your sleeping issues. From now on, you can stop relying on these harmful drugs for your better health and restful sleep.     DOZZ comes with multiple features that can help put you to sleep easily. It releases pulsation that can ease your mind and relieve your stress with the Neurowave Technology. It guides you to breathe with the rhythmic calming light. You can even surround yourself with our in-app Sleep Coaching Music for better sleep.  Your brain constantly produces bursts of electrical activity. In fact, that’s how groups of neurons in your brain communicate with each other. When your brain produces these electrical pulses, that’s what’s known as brainwave activity. With the latest Neurowave Technology, DOZZ uses a low-level electrical current to manipulate your brainwave. It reduces stress, anxiety and tension, aiding you to fall into the theta rhythm (the state between wakefulness and sleep), hence, falling asleep.  Theta WavesTheta waves are brain waves that occur in the 3 to 8 Hz range. Theta brain waves occur when you’re sleeping or dreaming. They may occur when you’re drifting off to sleep or suspended in that light phase of sleep, just before you wake up. Theta wave is classed as “slow” activity. It is seen in connection with creativity, intuition, daydreaming, and fantasizing and is a repository for memories, emotions, sensations. Theta waves are strong during internal focus, meditation, prayer, and spiritual awareness. When the theta rhythm appears to function normally it mediates and promotes adaptive, complex behaviors such as learning and memory.  There have been researches suggesting various ways to boost certain theta wave activity, and could help calm and reduce anxiety in people suffering from generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Brainwaves can be easily affected by external stimuli. Putting on DOZZ helps brainwave synchronize with the frequency, changing your mood and helping you get good sleep.     Taking slow, deep breaths is one of the easiest and most basic ways to engage your body’s natural relaxation response. If you find yourself lying awake in bed, start by taking 10 deep breaths. This alone can begin to slow the breath and create a sense of calm.  DOZZ has a built-in breathing light, which will guide you to breathe slowly. Inhale when the beam expands and exhale when it retracts. DOZZ gradually slows down your breathing from 10 to 6 breaths per minute (bpm), in a regular, rhythmic pattern conducive to a relaxing/ meditating state.  The calming blue light, projected on the ceiling, has a very low intensity (less than 1 lux) compared to the high intensity of mobile/computer screens (about 60 lux), and will not inhibit melatonin secretion.      Why we snore?When sleeping, the muscles around your throat relax and the uvula (the back edge of soft palate) may partially block your airway and vibrate. The more narrowed your airway, the more forceful the airflow becomes. This increases tissue vibration, which causes your snoring to grow louder.

   Flaüs uses sonic vibrations to move quickly and gently between tight teeth, removing stubborn plaque and debris from places your toothbrush can't access. Designed to reach the nooks and crannies with ease and give your gums the T.L.C. they deserve, Flaüs does the hard work for you.  With up to 12,000 sonic vibrations per minute, Flaüs effortlessly glides between tight teeth and removes plaque and debris - providing a strong yet gentle clean. Each Flaüs comes with a 3-month supply of replaceable Flaüs heads that are easy to use, sustainable and PFAS-free. After each flossing session, remember to compost or recycle the used heads (which are completely compostable and biodegradable), and simply snap on a new one! Many types of dental floss are coated in highly toxic substances (like PFAS), which are responsible for some of the most potent greenhouse gas emissions. Not only is this bad for the environment, but can also be super harmful for you too! 


 Made from plant-based materials and infinitely sustainable aluminum, Flaüs is better for your teeth and the planet. We believe innovation should not come at the expense of the environment. Prefer flossing on the go or in the shower? No problem! Our 1-month battery life, USB-C charging port and waterproof design make Flaüs the perfect travel companion or shower buddy.  Find maneuvering traditional floss tricky? Flaüs' ergonomic handle allows for greater control and easy access to those hard-to-reach places so you never miss your molars again. Dental hygiene is supposed to be, well, hygienic. Did you know up to 10 million bacteria live on your fingertips? Gross! Our thoughtfully designed handle keeps your fingers and uninvited germs out of your mouth. 


Brushing only cleans about 60% of your tooth's surface, leaving cracks and spaces between your teeth untouched. Flossing cleans the remaining 40% and is one of the best ways to improve your oral hygiene, beauty and overall health!



      Have a hard time remembering to floss? Flaüs has built-in LED tracking technology that offers visual cues to help you keep up healthy habits and stay accountable. Our magnetic mirror mount holds Flaüs above the sink, making it easily accessible and saving precious countertop space. Flaüs comes with everything you will need to elevate your oral care game. Most dental floss is made of nylon coated in synthetic wax, which is non-biodegradable and non-recyclable. Some even contain PFAS, which have been linked to adverse health consequences, including liver damage, thyroid disease, decreased fertility, obesity and cancer.         Add to your order at checkout!      Flaüs was designed for manufacturing (DFM) from the very beginning.  We have sourced manufacturing partners, completed six functional prototype iterations with robust user testing between each step, and have a team that has built and delivered/launched multiple physical products.

Any other entity claiming to sell Fat Iron is not related to us and might be fraudulent or not comply with the safety and efficacy test with which we tested Fat Iron.   The only FDA cleared device made for home-use that lets you sculpt the body you want. Fat Iron combines 3 clinically proven powerful Fat-reducing and skin-tightening technologies. They work in synergy to iron away stubborn fat, stretch marks, saggy skin, and wrinkles while strengthening & toning your muscles. All of that in only 15 min/day.   Fat Iron uses the same technology they use in fancy clinics. In those clinics, they add lots of wires, a big stand, and an impressive screen only to justify the price they charge; but only a small part does the work. Fat Iron uses the same powerful technology in a compact, affordable, and comfortable for home-use device... And only requires 15minutes of use a day.  
 

 

 


 
Stubborn fat cells are high in alpha receptors which prevents them from releasing their fat content regardless of sport and diet. The powerful technology of Fat Iron is strong enough to empty those stubborn fat cells easily and safely.
Women usually accumulate those cells around the thighs, hips and lower belly while men tend to have them on the love handles area.
We all struggle to lose fat but sometimes that’s only half the battle. After we’ve lost the fat we often suffer from saggy uneven skin and unappealing stretch marks, without mentioning the cellulite that persisted after the diet. 
 

The physiology of stubborn fat cells makes them resistant to regular diet and exercise. Fat Iron’s technology is designed to target those stubborn fat cells and empty their fat content. Fat Iron is the only way to effectively:


Just like a regular iron fixes the appearance of clothes, Fat Iron fixes your body imperfections with ease and control. Let Fat Iron give you the smooth and healthy-looking body you always wanted. 

 

 


 

Heats up and gradually destroys targeted fat cells, reducing fat levels.The energy also stimulates collagen by penetrating deep into the skin tissue.
 


 
EMS sends wave impulses down to the muscles. It can be used to gently reinforce muscles to even skin but we also included a fitness function that mimics a full fitness workout. Overall it will firm and strengthen your muscles to sculpt your body and repair your skin texture. It also helps stimulate collagen and elastin which gives your skin a younger feeling.


 

Powered with EMS technology, Fat Iron stimulates targeted muscles and acts as a full work-out, without the effort. Activate the fitness function and go over the muscle you wish to strengthen with the Fat Iron. The device will change functions on its own from warm-up to toning, to cool down and stop by itself after the 10 minutes work out. 
 


 

 
Red light therapy is a technology that has been used by NASA for the past decade. It uses specific wavelengths that stimulate cell renewal and helps minimize fine lines, wrinkles, and stretch marks.
 

 

 

You don’t have to worry about those long crowdfunding waits, Fat Iron is ready for production!  We already successfully produced a batch of Fat Iron devices for the clinical test. The production and the devices work perfectly. We have everything we need to start production!

This small machine has powerful steel cables accompanied by 6 versatile attachments and generates up to 200 lbs of resistance. You can do 250+ exercises making BodyFly the optimal piece of equipment for staying in the best shape of your life.No more waiting for machines or struggling to find time to go to the gym. Get a complete body transformation right at home! BodyFly lets you maximize your time and pack on muscle right in your home. With 250+ exercises and up to 200 lbs resistance, you’ll never get bored or plateau.The compact cable machine single-handedly allows you to target your back, chest, arms, legs and core. Unlike bands where resistance changes constantly during exercise, BodyFly’s patented technology maintains constant linear and horizontal resistance, making exercises smoother and more efficient.This incredibly powerful and stable resistance is possible in BodyFly because of the latest advancements in gas shock technology. You're basically working out against the force of something that is able to rebound the weight of a car! The BodyFly Cable System was created by former US Military Veteran, Kareem Smith, and former Wide Receiver/Special Teamer for the San Diego Chargers, Seyi Ajirotutu.When Kareem was aboard the USNS Mercy, the gyms were small and crowded by the ship's crew. Working out was a hassle and he envisioned a better way to get a powerful workout without much space.Once he returned to San Diego, he shared his idea with Seyi and close friends. Those initial conversations instantly revealed how revolutionary their compact gym idea was and they immediately started working on a prototype. Now, 5 years and 4 product iterations later, BodyFly is ready for market! Currently, there is no machine with the same functionality and size as BodyFly. No need to stress about setup or pay any installation fees, BodyFly comes fully assembled so you can exercise the moment it arrives!  BodyFly is your new everyday trainer. Whether you want strength training, pilates, yoga, sports-specific training or cardio—it can all be performed with Bodyfly!BodyFly comes with 6 different attachments to accommodate your preferred exercise and training style. Forget carrying weights back and forth at the gym. BodyFly cables have 6 resistance settings, up to 100 lbs per cable! Change variable resistance with the click of a lever for the maximum workout in the minimum amount of time.There are Green, Yellow and Red toggle selectors that control the specific resistance within those ranges.Your BodyFly comes with 12 interchangeable resistance shocks. This gives you more precise customization of resistance settings so you can move up or down in resistance.  All you need to workout with BodyFly is a 4x4’ space! It’s so compact it works for even the tiniest apartments without any rearranging! Plus, it’s only 45lbs, making it easy to stow away after your workout.It doesn’t matter if you live in a studio apartment, as long as you have 4x4’ of space, you can workout with BodyFly!Unlike typical functional trainers that are permanently installed or weigh hundreds of pounds, BodyFly is portable. Its lightweight design means you can get a pro-level workout anytime, anywhere. Take it outside or transport it anywhere you want to workout, like the park, beach or backyard. At 45lbs and 22in x 22in x 5.5in, BodyFly can travel with you on your longer trips by car, plane, or train.BodyFly supports users up to 275lbs. BodyFly's resistance mechanism uses steel-wrapped cables, NOT bands, and the platform stays in place during use.Our home version will be made of a combination of ABS plastic and steel components for structural support. Most home fitness equipment doesn’t allow for multiple users—BodyFly does!BodyFly’s unique design lets 2 individuals workout simultaneously without interrupting each other. Hello couples workouts! Each BodyFly comes with a detailed user manual, exercise chart, and 21-day workout challenge to kick-off your new routine!  BodyFly Fitness' 21-day workout challenge was created by world-renowned fitness professionals Linda Shelton and PJ Stahl. The program gives you 3 weeks of circuit training with 6 days on and 1 day off.  Keep your workouts fresh with pre-recorded or live fitness classes, and 1-on-1 personal training with certified BodyFly trainers. We partnered with OnPodio, a subscription-based software app that has 24/7 online video content you can access on your phone, tablet or smart TV devices. BodyFly’s safety system retracts cables internally if you release or drop the handles while exercising. You’ll never have to worry about dropping weights on yourself or resistance bands snapping and causing an injury. Whether you’ve just conquered your first push-up or you’re practically a pro athlete, BodyFly’s unique design offers 6 different resistance settings so you can work up to achieving your goals anywhere you want to workout!You can get in a workout rain or shine, sleet or snow!  Unlike most at-home workout devices that come in 1-2 colors, BodyFly has 6 colors to choose from. New to Indiegogo?

</div></div>","Sore from the gym? Back pain from working and sitting? Aches from arthritis? We developed GEO™ to give you deep-penetrating warmth to optimize your recovery from aches and pains.GEO™ is the very first Recovery Pad that is made from Graphene Nanotechnology - the Nobel prize-winning material. It’s super light, eco-friendly, thermoregulated, and most importantly, emits Far-Infrared Heat that’s 100% natural & drug-free.     Graphene is a fantastic new supermaterial. It’s the world’s best thermal regulator and conductor. We’re not exaggerating. It’s scientifically proven to conduct an incredible amount of heat extremely fast. In fact, it conducts more heat faster than any other known material in existence, better than diamond!   The miracle element, Graphene emits natural FIR heat that you can’t get enough of. This helps enhance the natural healing power of your body beneath your skin. Why is this important? You might not see it with your eyes, but this helps increase the blood circulation of your body, immediately improving and increasing recovery time by over 85% (Yes! a bunch of scientists worked really hard to prove this, no joke). The scientific benefits of Far-Infrared Heat have been measurably proven to provide amazing benefits from inducing relaxation, increasing circulation, and promoting faster recovery.   Current products available in the market only emits heat on the surface of the skin and offers minimal effectiveness. Products such as electric heating pads or carbon fiber-based heating pads can be harmful and might not solve your pain. These products may even cause burns if used for a long period of time    Say goodbye to burning, irritation, and overheating on your skin! Graphene’s natural thermal regulating properties will regulate with your body temperature.  Kiss your pain away with the perfect temperature bath going right to your achy spots.? or just like the feel of the cool winter sun that warms you to your bones.☀️ GEO's Unboxing Video  

 

 
 GEO™’s been tested by countless independent studies across the globe that support the benefits of Graphene’s FIR heat. These Independent studies have tested the effective benefits of Graphene by itself and combined with other traditional treatments such as acupuncture and resulted in a dramatic increase in accelerated recovery rate.Still need convincing?

<p>Tooth staining pigment substances are found in not only on the tooth’s surface but the cracks as well, so it is very important that the light is transmitted to both places.</p>
<p>With typical LED light technologies, light rarely reaches the core of its destination because the intensity of light weakens with distance or a substance that serves as an obstacle.</p>

<p>Dr. Quorum uses the right amount of sonic wave vibrations and light to efficiently remove plaque and color pigments, making it easy to remove plaque and whitening at home.</p>

<p>To improve the plaque removal performance, regular electric toothbrushes with strong vibrations often cause damage to teeth and gums.</p>
<p>Dr. Quorum uses optical fiber brush and accelerator light technology to efficiently remove pigments and plaque without damaging teeth and gums even with more gentle vibrations.</p>

<p><strong><span>Get the exact care and attention your teeth needs.</span></strong></p>
<p>Unlike conventional electric toothbrushes that are difficult to use for braces due to strong vibrations, Dr. Quorum’s optic care electric toothbrush can be used for braces because of its gentle vibrations.</p>
<p>Strong plaque removal performance and teeth whitening effects have been difficult to achieve during braces, but now made attainable with Dr. Quorum.</p>
<p>The vibration frequency and LED light in ortho mode will serve as assistance with the corrective treatment by facilitating tooth movement.</p>

<p>** The sterilization function of Dr. Quorum was tested using a culture plate. A culture plate is a plate that is frequently used in bacterial testing, because it provides a nutrient-rich base for microorganisms to grow.</p>
<p>Within one day, the bacteria on the left plate (before sterilization) grew and turned moldy, unlike the clean plate on the right, where none of the bacteria survived.</p>

Because teeth are one of the most notable factors in first impressions, taking care of them the right way is that much more important. 
 
 

 

 
With whiter teeth, you'll be inclined to smile more, which helps create a great first impression and evoke confidence.
 
 
 

 

 
Innovative dental care technology that was only accessible at the dentist’s office is now available for you to use at home.
Created by three dentists, the Dr. Quorum Collection is a dental grade whitening care solution package.
 

 

 
The whitening accelerator light technology in combination with Dr. Quorum’s patented photocatalyst is proven to deliver the most powerful teeth whitening effects. 
 
 


 

 
Dr. Quorum's U.S. patented whitening technology effectively removes unwanted stains and yellow hues, transforming them into pearly whites.
Our formula is completely safe, promoting and protecting oral health by removing plaque that causes cavities, gum disease, and bad breath.
 


 

 

 
We tested Dr. Quorum’s whitening efficacy by using it on coffee-stained teeth for a week.
Dr. Quorum showed teeth whitening effects of FIVE shades lighter (based on the Vita classical shade guide).
Dr. Quorum’s teeth whitening effects are nearly double of the competitor’s electric toothbrush.
 

 
 

5 sets of cleaning and whitening (clean mode, white mode) were conducted on the teeth of a man with severe discoloration from cigarettes. After just 2.5 days of using Dr. Quorum, it was evident that the brown pigments stained with nicotine were decomposed.
Update: 4 weeks of maintenance transformed his teeth; Say hello to pearly whites!
 


 

 
Our toothbrush is made of fiber optic bristles.
Optical fiber technology uses the physical principle of total reflection to transmit light to its destination, even if there is a distance or an obstacle.
The toothbrush emits the light through the toothpaste and delivers strong LED accelerator light to the tooth surface.

 

 

Dr. Quorum is designed to ensure that the accelerator light reaches its destination to the essential areas of the tooth, using optical fiber technology.
 
 

 
Tooth staining pigment substances are found in not only on the tooth’s surface but the cracks as well, so it is very important that the light is transmitted to both places.
With typical LED light technologies, light rarely reaches the core of its destination because the intensity of light weakens with distance or a substance that serves as an obstacle.
 


 

 

 
In typical whitening products, hydrogen peroxide levels need to reach at least 10 percent in order to be effective for teeth whitening.
However, if the amount of hydrogen peroxide is 10 percent or more in a whitening product, it can result in long-term teeth and gum damage.
 
 

 
Dr. Quorum’s teeth whitening method delivers double the pigment decomposition effect while using zero or minimal (3 percent) hydrogen peroxide than products that utilizes 15 percent of hydrogen peroxide without the advanced technology (typical whitening toothpastes on the market).

 

 

 
Safe, efficient plaque removal and pigment decomposition for healthy white teeth:
Achieved through the patented photocatalyst photosensitization technology and the galactose quorum sensing inhibitor technology.
 
 

 


 
  Daily teeth whitening: 
Brush twice a day with the whitening toothpaste
Benefit : Teeth so clean, it'll feel like you just got a dental cleaning done

 
Concentrated teeth whitening:
Use the whitening gel for 2 minutes twice a day periodically
Benefits: Bright, white teeth, need I say more?

 
Achieving White Teeth
If you feel that you need concentrated whitening care, use whitening mode for 1 to 2 weeks. Once desired results have been achieved, you can maintain it by using the daily toothpaste and clean mode without hydrogen peroxide.


 

 
The photocatalytic whitening toothpaste absorbs light and makes pigmentation significantly brighter. It quickly and safely decompose the pigments that are stained on your teeth, transforming your teeth into a bright white.
 
 

 

Our pigment decomposition technology uses the principle that light meets with photocatalysts to produce hydroxyl radicals and decomposes pigments through these molecules.
We can safely achieve whitening effects through this technology because it decomposes pigmented molecules and plaque and produces oxygen without damaging or eliminating other important elements.

 

 

 

 
Dentists with relevant, professional expertise invented the whitening electric toothbrush that is truly effective through joint research.
 

 
 


 

 

 
The conventional electric toothbrush vibrates dozens of times a second and has a much greater effect on removing plaque and whitening teeth than manual brushing.
However, many people find it difficult to use due to the aggressive vibration.
Dr. Quorum uses the right amount of sonic wave vibrations and light to efficiently remove plaque and color pigments, making it easy to remove plaque and whitening at home.
 


 

 
To improve the plaque removal performance, regular electric toothbrushes with strong vibrations often cause damage to teeth and gums.
Dr. Quorum uses optical fiber brush and accelerator light technology to efficiently remove pigments and plaque without damaging teeth and gums even with more gentle vibrations.
 


 

 
Get the exact care and attention your teeth needs.
Unlike conventional electric toothbrushes that are difficult to use for braces due to strong vibrations, Dr. Quorum’s optic care electric toothbrush can be used for braces because of its gentle vibrations.
Strong plaque removal performance and teeth whitening effects have been difficult to achieve during braces, but now made attainable with Dr. Quorum.
The vibration frequency and LED light in ortho mode will serve as assistance with the corrective treatment by facilitating tooth movement.
 


 

 

 
Dr. Quorum has disinfecting and drying functions. The disinfecting feature uses safe UV-A light to activate the remaining photocatalyst after the use of toothpaste to safely disinfect it.
The interior of the cap is designed to reflect light and self-ventilate, preventing light exposure during the disinfection process.
 
 

 

 The disinfecting test results show the stark difference between performing the sterilization mode for 10 minutes and not doing so, after using the Dr. Quorum toothbrush with its toothpaste.
 

 
** The sterilization function of Dr. Quorum was tested using a culture plate. A culture plate is a plate that is frequently used in bacterial testing, because it provides a nutrient-rich base for microorganisms to grow.
Within one day, the bacteria on the left plate (before sterilization) grew and turned moldy, unlike the clean plate on the right, where none of the bacteria survived.
 
 


 

 

 
Made of IPX6 (waterproof functions): use it without worrying about malfunction, even exposure to water.


 

 
Dr. Quorum’s toothbrush case makes it extremely convenient to carry around because it prevents contamination and damage of the toothbrush head.


 

 

Wireless charging to deliver the ultimate convenience.
Made with a USB-A-type, you can plug it into any charging adapter or computer.
 
 
 

 

 
 


 

 
 


 

 
 


 

 
** If you select the double pack, you can get 2 add-on packages by paying extra.

When purchasing 2 whitening toothpastes: Additional pledge $12
When purchasing 2 whitening gels: Additional pledge $16
When purchasing 2 toothbrush heads: Additional pledge $8

 
** We are preparing so that you will be able to purchase from Amazon and Shopify at its original price point after the Kickstarter campaign. You will be able to purchase consumables such as the whitening toothpaste, whitening gel, and electric toothbrush separately.
 
 
 

 

 
 
 


 

 

 

 Power on/ changing modes : Press power button briefly to power on and change modes
 Power off : Press power button for more than 2 seconds. Automatically off after 2 minutes of use
 Disinfection function : Automatically disinfects when the power button is pressed for more than 2 seconds or plugged into the charger
 Disinfection function off : During disinfection, press the power button or remove from the charger

 
 

 
Notice
You should brush your teeth with light pressure to the teeth and gums.
If you brush too hard, your toothbrush can bend and damage your teeth and gums.
 
Clean Mode 
Designed to remove plaque between teeth with smooth vibration


 

White Mode
Maximized teeth whitening effects by implementing the vibration rate that best transmits light to teeth through fiber optics


 

Ortho Mode
Efficiently removes plaque that is not easy to remove between the brackets and helps corrective treatment by transferring vibration and light to the braces to promote teeth movement


 
 
 


 

 
 A total of two toothbrush cases are provided.
You can easily change the toothbrush head if you take it out with a little bit of force.
 
 

 
 The purple wavelengths are far less harmful to the eyes than blue wavelengths.
However, extended direct exposure to any light can worsen your eyesight so please be mindful of that.
 
 

 
If you use high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide for dental purposes, your gums can often turn white. If you stop using it immediately when your gums turn white, they will come back to their original color within 10 minutes, so you don't have to worry. However, if your gums turn white frequently, reduce the amount of whitening gel and use only the daily whitening toothpaste.

This is the reason why some many men, women and children experience neck pain and bad posture problems... THIS HAS ALL BEEN CHANGED!    If you keep the deep neck muscles strong you will ALWAYS maintain a Healthy Pain Free Neck and Absolute Perfect Posture... FOR LIFE! … SO WHAT'S BEEN THE PROBLEM? If we know what muscles to strengthen to keep our neck permanently pain free and our posture straight... ""WHY"" do so many people STILL SUFFER from neck pain and bad posture?  Previously, when treating neck pain and bad posture, there was “ALWAYS” one problem doctors, physio's and health practitioners could NOT find an answer to:   ONE MINUTE PER DAY   In the forward motion, when you push your chin down to your chest you are stretching the DEEP muscles at the back of the neck, the DEEP upper back muscles and the Trapezius muscle (posture muscle). This action also reduces tightness in the muscles and relieves pressure from the cervical spine.In the reverse motion, when you push your head back to the upright position, the resistance applied from the spring headboard strengthens the deep muscles at the back of the neck ALL AT THE SAME TIME quickly stabilizing the neck and straightening your posture.  My Perfect Neck takes only SECONDS to put on, and thanks to its easy-to-use design built to strengthen multiple neck muscles in one motion, results are FAST and EFFECTIVE.  Say GOODBYE to time-consuming set up and HELLO to My Perfect Neck, the device that is always ready to go when you are. Just pick it up, put it on and start using it... It's that simple.  When you’re done using it, simply slip it off, fold it up and its ready to go next time.    The muscles (pictured above) are attached to the upper neck, lower neck and the upper back area. They play a critical role in supporting the neck and keeping your posture strong and in its correct upright position.The revolutionary strengthening action of My Perfect Neck strengthens all of these muscles ""AT THE SAME TIME"" significantly speeding up the stabilization of the entire neck area.   My Perfect Neck was created out of desperation.  For almost 2 ½ years I had constant debilitating neck pain as a result of a neck injury I received. The problem was my neck muscles had weakened as a result of the injury and pressure began to develop on my spine.  This pressure compressed the cervical discs and then started pinching a nerve. It started with a light tingle on the back of the neck (C7 disc) and as the pressure increased, the more intense was the pain.  It reached a point where the pain got so bad that doctors gave me two choices: have a cervical spinal fusion operation (fuse the cervical disc joints) to try and stop the pain, or learn to live with it. I chose neither. Instead, I decided to spend the next 12 months obsessively studying the neck and how it works to try and fix the problem myself.  Cervical Spine Fusion During this research period I tried various neck strengthening techniques that did not work out too well, and boy oh boy, did I experience pain. One of the techniques caused so much pain that I couldn’t even lie down. During one of the nights when the pain forced me to sleep sitting on a Lazy Boy chair, I remember thinking “how did I get here?” But I pushed through it… I had to… I was not prepared to have my neck joints fused.  Creating the first My Perfect Neck prototype was a life changing moment. We were confident that it would improve my condition, but we did not realise just HOW MUCH and HOW FAST.In just under 4 weeks (26 days... yes I counted) My Perfect Neck strengthened my neck, stabilized my cervical spine and achieved for me what no health practitioner could achieve in two and a half years… I WAS PAIN FREE. I use My Perfect Neck every day for ONE MINUTE (15 reps) on setting 2.I have been completely pain free since October 2017.Isaias Florenca - Co Founder   These deep neck muscles are by far ""THE MOST IMPORTANT"" muscles in the neck, but they are also THE MOST DIFFICULT to strengthen. Their vital role is to stabilize the cervical spine. We call the Cervical neck muscles ""The Holy Grail"" because they are so deep inside the neck that they have been almost impossible to strengthen ... UNTIL NOW!   Put one hand on the back of your neck and then look down at your mobile phone, feel that stretch? That’s the Trapezius muscle. Its role is to keep your posture straight.If you work on a computer all day, spend hours on a mobile device, or have bad posture habits then you are putting undue pressure on the Trapezius muscle causing it to stretch, lose elasticity and deform. This is when serious posture and spine problems begin.My Perfect Neck quickly strengthens the Trapezius muscle and keeps it strong so the neck ALWAYS springs back to Its correct upright position keeping your posture perfectly straight.      ""Spine surgeons are noticing an increase in patients with neck and upper back pain likely related to poor posture during prolonged computer and smartphone use""  according to a recent report in The Spine Journal.  Today, neck pain is one of the most common muscular problems after back pain, and is mostly reported in people who are on their smart phone or have to sit in front of the computer for long hours... but the question that most did not have an answer to was how to properly strengthen the neck muscles. Link:   Text Neck is Turning Our Children into a Generation of Hunchbacks  Someone with Tech Neck (text neck) can have a multitude of symptoms including: chronic neck and back pain, posture problems, muscle spasms, shoulder pain, chronic headaches, disc related injuries, early spinal degeneration, to name only a few.  Spinal Neurosurgeon: “By the time patients get to me, they’re already in bad pain and have disc issues.

Feel free to place your order for the holidays! Please note, if you want us to send out right away, please place order on www.yflife-us.com (as Indiegogo will hold the funds for 10 days).If you have any question, please feel free to email us: hello@yflife-us.comThank you for all of your support and we will do our best continue on the process. AIR6+ is the most Eco-Friendly air purifier on market for 360sqft. It is powerful, compact, lightweight, quiet, and yet stylish. With it's size of your palm, you can take the AIR6+ anywhere you go.With extremely powerful 3D PCO (Photocatalytic Oxidation tech that space station also use) multiplier technology, negative ion technology, and nano PCO washable filter, AIR6+ can breakdown particle size down to 0.001um (micron) with no maintenance cost.    
Done by 3rd party FDA 510 cleared lab
According to the 3rd party testing report, the percentage of MS2 RNA Virus goes from 100% to 0.07% in 120 minutes. ""For this study, the device was challenged at the highest setting using aerosolized MS2 bacteriophage which has been historically used as a surrogate for numerous respiratory viruses, such as influenza, rhinovirus, and is a tentative surrogate for SARS-CoV-2.""Click link below for full report (or scroll down for part of the report)Full Lab Test Report Small Chamber- Done by FDA 510 Cleared ARE labs.Full Lab Test Report Large Chamber- Done by FDA 510 Cleared ARE labs.  AIR6+ maximizes the purification rate using unique 3 dimensional Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) technology layout, multiple PCO layers, and maximum reflection mirrors.  Does AIR6+ produces Ozone (we know some other PCO device does)?No. Unlike other air purifiers that need the carbon filter to absorb the zone generated. AIR6+ uses Long Lasting UV-A LED for ZERO Ozone creation purpose. How does AIR6+ PCO work?It generates billions of free radical to breaks down harmful particles that passes through the PCO chamber instead of trapping them in a filter. Where can you see PCO Tech in use?PCO tech is used in space station, hospital, and health care facility for air purification.Why choose PCO over HEPA filter?AIR6+ PCO technology is able to break down particles to 0.001um (micron) while HEPA filter is only capable of trapping particles down to 0.3um.  Despite its compact size, the AIR6+ is capable of purifying up to 360 square feet. For example, living room, bedroom, kitchen, office, airplane travel, hotels, and so many more places you can think of! AIR6+ is designed to be small enough to carry in the palm of your hand, it can conveniently fit on a nightstand, coffee table, or TV stand in your house. So you can bring it with you anywhere! AIR6+ uses Carbon Brush Anion technology to generate 20 Million per second negative Ion to reduce 99.9% PM2.5 aerosol pollutants without producing ozone, giving you forest-like fresh air.  AIR6+ washable filter is not an ordinary filter. It is a PCO washable filter that not only blocking most of the large particles, it also clean the air by trigger PCO effect at the very first stage.  The magnetic base is designed to easily detach and reattach, you can rinse, air dry, and reuse.  Buying an expensive air purifier and having to replace HEPA and carbon filters can cost up to $75 about every 6 months, and this will add more waste into the landfill.   AIR6+ is as quiet as a whisper at a mere 20 decibels at sleep mode. You can have it on 24/7 without producing too much noise. AIR6+ has three fan speeds that can be easily adjusted with one button. The three options correspond to the breathing lights in three colors:

Light Green: Silent mode, for low noise 20dB.

Orange light: Normal mode, for general operation 35dB.

Blue light: Turbo mode, for strengthening purification & increasing fan speed 60dB.
    Formaldehyde Actual Test Mold Test PM2.5 Reduction Test  Formaldehyde (Chemical pollutant) TestingFull Report Link HereStaphylococcus Aureus (Bacteria) TestingFull Link Report here  A compact AIR6+ can run up to 13 W high power on turbo mode while purifying 360 square feet, and that is about 24% of other air purifiers energy consumption (on highest mode).

<p>I got my personal trainer certification so I could make some money on the side helping people lose weight. What I didn’t realize was that I was in the early stages of starting something way more meaningful. If I could help people get their health in order, why couldn’t I also help people get their lives together? And better yet -- why couldn’t I help those people get into positions that could help others do the same? </p>
<p>This is the beginning of the JTF Viking Army fitness brand. This OGV shirt represents everything I’ve worked so hard for over the last several years as a trainer and as a coach. While some may view it as a piece of clothing, I see it as a symbol of dedication to mind, body and spirit -- the holy trinity of life change. The Viking Army is more than just a fitness brand, after all -- it’s a community of people who are tired of feeling left in the dark when it comes to their health and who are ready to take control of their lives.</p>
<p>My good friend and fellow Knoxville local Ryan Stepp designed these shirts and Knoxville-local company Black Sheep Printing will be printing them. The design is front-and-back and will be on high-quality cotton/poly blend  6210 Next Level tees.</p>
<p>With this being our first design, however, a small investment will need to be made in order to have the shirts printed. We’re confident this pre-sale will help us offset the cost of having the shirts made so that we can get these out into the world and get people talking about what this movement can do for them.</p>
<p>The quote to have the first batch of shirts printed is $500 which includes a design art separation fee, processing and storage. Supporting this cause at the full cost will earn you your own OGV design tee (at a discount!) and any other amount will result in our eternal gratitude! You’ve helped change the world! </p>
<p>This is incredibly exciting for us and we cannot wait to show you what we’re able to accomplish beginning with this one simple project. </p>

With Encompass, you brush all 3 surfaces of the teeth in half of your mouth simultaneously for 10 seconds. When you think about it, that means you are actually brushing each tooth for 8 times longer with an Encompass toothbrush!  Cleaning half your teeth at once, the brush head self-adjusts to your mouth, ensuring an optimal cleaning of your teeth and gums every time in just 20 seconds. The ""flex fingers"" of the J-shaped brush head adjust to any imperfections in teeth alignment as well as variations in teeth size and shape, while the longitudinal flex point adjusts for ideal arch fit.  Patented Air Pump System quietly delivers 100 brush strokes per second, providing a gentle and effective cleaning of the teeth and gum line.        With an experienced team of leading engineers, dental professionals, and designers,we have truly designed the next revolution in oral care: a toothbrush that is quick, effective and SIMPLE. 

 
       Every great company begins with a revolutionary idea. Ours was both incredibly ambitious, yet refreshingly simple: What if everyone could be guaranteed to brush their teeth flawlessly in just 20 seconds?Of course, groundbreaking ideas are meaningless without the ability to execute. In addition to building the right executive team, we proudly enlisted one of the top toothbrush engineers in the field, Gerald “Jerry” Brewer, the former Director of Engineering for both Sonicare and Clarisonic, to build Encompass. Over the last 5 years, with the help of Jerry and his engineering team, leading dental professionals and industrial designers, we are bringing our idea to life. Encompass is not just another ""gimmick"" toothbrush; it's a true medical device designed to provide you with optimal oral care.  The Encompass team also includes senior engineers, industrial designers, and regulatory experts. Our world-class Advisory Board is comprised of leading dental professionals and dental industry experts. We have secured relationships with top design and manufacturing firms.

<h2><strong>Overview:</strong></h2>
<p>I am Dr. Salvatore DeRicco - a dentist, orthodontist, award-winning toothbrush inventor, and successful entrepreneur.  And I have invented The WUNDERBRUSH for GUMS™, which is the first brush engineered specifically <i>for</i> gums, and which was inspired by the estimated 90% of adults and teenagers who have gum disease - either gingivitis or periodontitis, and the many life-threatening and life-shortening diseases, which are known to be linked to gum disease.</p>
<p>While The WUNDERBRUSH for GUMS™ was conceived of one year before the COVID-19 pandemic, the discovered link between gum disease and more severe effects of COVID-19 infection further inspired and expedited the need to produce it. <strong> The most recent research - indicating that COVID-19 is NINE TIMES more fatal - in victims with gum disease, than in those without gum disease, validated our efforts:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://nypost.com/2021/02/08/covid-19-patients-with-gum-disease-more-likely-to-die-study/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://nypost.com/2021/02/08/covid-19-patients...</a></p>
<p>I <i>truly</i> appreciate your considering The WUNDERBRUSH for GUMS™, and I hope that you can support this Campaign by either pledging for one of our Rewards and/or sharing the Campaign with your loved ones, friends, and colleagues, who may benefit from The WUNDERBRUSH for GUMS™ - even if just to <i>improve their breath</i>, for when you have to meet with them! </p>

<p>...but even <i>more</i> importantly, and due to gum disease being a <i>chronic inflammatory infection</i>, which enables pathologic oral bacteria to enter our bloodstreams, gum disease is <i>also</i> linked to the following Life-Shortening Diseases and Life-Threatening Diseases: </p>

<p>There are two things that <i>other</i> brushes lack, which restricts them from getting to where The WUNDERBRUSH for GUMS does - <i>REACH</i> and <i>FIT</i>. Other brushes cannot predictably <i>reach</i> - both <i>to</i> our gumlines and <i>under</i> our gumlines - <i>especially</i> on the tongue sides of our teeth, because our teeth, themselves, <i>obstruct</i> other brushes from getting there; and other, multi-row brushes have too many rows of bristles, to be able to <i>fit</i> under our gumlines.  The WUNDERBRUSH for GUMS solves <i>both</i> of these problems:</p>
<p>1. By having an offset/extended head, which reaches <i>over</i> our front teeth - to <i>reach</i> our gumlines on the tongue sides of our back teeth, and <i>over</i> our back teeth, to <i>reach</i> our gumlines on the tongue side of our front teeth</p>
<p>2. By having just <i>one</i> row of bristles, in order to be able to <i>fit</i> <i>under</i> our gumlines!  </p>
<p>In addition, the bristles are offset by 45 degrees (to the sides of the handle), to help <i>guide</i> the bristles under our gumlines.  </p>
<p>And, finally, I designed the handle to be hollow – to reduce its plastic volume, and to reduce “plastic pollution”.  This was inspired by The Ocean Elders - an eminent advocacy team, which includes H. M. Queen Noor, H. S. H. Prince Albert II, Jackson Browne, Neil Young, Sir Richard Branson, Jean-Michel Cousteau, and many other researchers, educators, dignitaries and celebrities, who have brought my attention to this important consideration.</p>

<p>3 - It has only <i>ONE</i> row of Ultra-Soft bristles, so the bristles can<i> predictably</i> fit into the crevice between your gums and teeth</p>

</div></div>","Overview:
I am Dr. Salvatore DeRicco - a dentist, orthodontist, award-winning toothbrush inventor, and successful entrepreneur.  And I have invented The WUNDERBRUSH for GUMS™, which is the first brush engineered specifically for gums, and which was inspired by the estimated 90% of adults and teenagers who have gum disease - either gingivitis or periodontitis, and the many life-threatening and life-shortening diseases, which are known to be linked to gum disease.
While The WUNDERBRUSH for GUMS™ was conceived of one year before the COVID-19 pandemic, the discovered link between gum disease and more severe effects of COVID-19 infection further inspired and expedited the need to produce it.  The most recent research - indicating that COVID-19 is NINE TIMES more fatal - in victims with gum disease, than in those without gum disease, validated our efforts:

<p><strong>ContaKids Cards</strong> founder Justina Brazaitė has been running ContaKids classes in both Norway and Lithuania, when she realised something was missing: a tool that would help families <strong>log off, move, play,  connect, and be completely present with each other.</strong> Something that would let families easily create those precious moments both in and out of ContaKids classes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625068006/xagwazan9l8zwnwyofss.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So.. Justina hooked up with Itay Yatuv, ContaKids founder, and Sam Baum, a designer and fellow ContaKids teacher. And, together with Sam’s brother, an illustrator Josh Baum, they have developed ContaKids Cards!</p>
<p>We just ran a successful campaign on Kickstarter reaching enough funds to bring ContaKids Cards to life. But we still need <strong>YOUR HELP</strong> so we can upgrade the packaging and reach out to people all around the world. And the best way to help is  to order your decks of ContaKids Cards and invite others to do so too.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">OUR VALUES</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We do what we do in an ethical and playful way, always thinking about quality and sustainability</strong></p>
<p>Thus ContaKids Cards will come to life in a beautiful, ethical, and environmentally conscious print. We have chosen top-quality, durable, and long-lasting materials for the production. We will be using FSC certified paper/cardboard, and printing will be done with vegetable based ink locally in Europe, where our base is, thus minimising shipping and also supporting local businesses. We also will be using as little packaging as possible.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have tested ContaKids Cards with our pilot families and the game works great. Throughout many years of experience in print design Studio, Baum has also developed a trustworthy partnership with a local manufacturer in Bristol, UK, who specializes in ethical and environmentally conscious prints. We have thoroughly worked out the logistics to make sure that you get your ContaKids Cards as soon as possible after the campaign ends. Our main challenge is the constantly changing and unpredictable situation of the pandemic, which could disrupt the shipping and take a little bit more time. But we will be keeping our supporters updated on the status of our project.</p>

Everyone remembers that fresh air smell left from a thunder and lightning storm - the ozone made it that way! The benefit of ozone treatment is derived from its strong oxidation potential and the ability to transform and degrade most organic substances. The ozone works by breaking down the molecular bonds that hold grime to your clothes. Ozone makes this breakdown faster and more reliable than detergents, and it doesn't leave any chemical contamination in water and clothes. And you need fresh air in the house – make it happen with WONDERTOOL™ – it's a BONUS.WONDERTOOL™ does your laundry anywhere and doesn't need a fixed connection to water supply and drain. The ergonomic design includes a durable handle for easy carrying, and a strong, tightly closing lid for loading and unloading your laundry. WONDERTOOL™ work from AC 110-240 v. Weight without loading - 11 lb (5 kg) and capable of washing up to - 6 lb (3kg). Dimensions - 13 ""15 ""13""WONDERTOOL™ makes your life easier and compatible with Sonoff Wi-fi Smart on/off Timer, Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit & Google AssistantYou can put WONDERTOOL™ anywhere: on the floor, in the shower cabin, in the bath, on the table or countertop and even on the ground near the house or car. For safe use of WONDERTOOL™ in high humidity conditions, we specifically use a low-volt safety supply of DC 12V, as in your car.   WONDERTOOL™  SAVES MONEY with EVERY WASH, PAYS for ITSELF within few MONTHS,  and HEALTH - PRICELESSWONDERTOOL ™ SOLVES MANY OF YOUR DAILY LAUNDRY PROBLEMS:SPORTSWEAR gets dirty and smelly every day and is often needed the next day. With WONDERTOOL™ your favorite sportswear will be clean without chemical powder insideDAILY WEAR: shirts, blouses and personal items require that fresh and clean look. And you don't need someone else's mud on them from the public laundromat. Why accumulate children's clothing in the laundry basket? To make it even dirtier due to cross-contamination of other bacteria? Or waiting to accommodate a small wash in-between big load?But most of all, kids clothes accumulate every day, and they are always very lacking. Don't you want to solve this problem without the risk of washing powder and germs on your delicate babies skin? Detergents adhere strongly to tissues and even repeatedly rinsing clothes in clean water doesn't allow them to be completely removed. It is always on our skin, and absorbed, causing allergic reactions and more serious health problems. The main role of detergents is to reduce contamination and the bonding of molecules to textiles. The same task is successfully solved with the help of ozone, and no more chemicals for washing clothes when you have the WONDERTOOL™Ironically the very detergents that we normally use to get our clothes “clean” may actually be leaving them worse off than they were before we ran the wash. When you first switch to laundry your clothes w/ WONDERTOOL™, you will have suds whether or not you add any soap. There are so much residual soap and chemicals in your clothes after traditional laundering methods that you will be amazed. Switch to ozone washing w/ WONDERTOOL™ and stop all those chemicals from getting on the skin and inside your body.Regular washing machines don't kill enough pathogenic germs and viruses with normal temperature treatment, turning your laundry into a bacterial danger. Good bio-security practices - using the biocidal properties of ozone to remove dirt, bacteria and viruses from your laundry reduces and even eliminates the need for harsh detergents for washing. Allergic reactions are eliminated due to residues of biocides in washed clothes and it becomes sterile and naturally fresh when you have the WONDERTOOL™  Ozone laundering eradicates 99 % of bacteria and viruses in less than a few minutes, and this isn't an achievable result for traditional heat treatment.  Studies of traditional thermal washing have shown that only exposure to water at a temperature of 160ºF (71ºC) for 25 minutes will lead to the death of almost all pathogens. The process also needs a dizzying set of toxic chemicals, including Chlorine, which you absolutely don't want to take. Ozone first oxidizes and destroys bacteria, viruses and then turns into oxygen. WONDERTOOL™  replaces most of the chemicals needed to achieve an excellent end result only cold ozone saturated water.Don't worry about damaging your expensive clothes made from natural silk and cashmere, there’s no need to sort clothes into different fabrics or colors for separate loads. Clothes become softer, fluffier, and fabric life is extended longer. Ozonated cold water will change your wash and you don't have to worry about damaged clothes when using the WONDERTOOL™. What you are left with are clean clothes free of any smells, grime or chemicals. And don't worry about the colored clothes - WONDERTOOL™ is washing in cold water - the colors stay in place.Degradation of the clothes textile takes in the traditional wash wheel, where dynamic loads of twisting and stretching in hot water with caustic chemicals wear out and abrade the fabric. WONDERTOOL™ ozone washing by curtailing the chemicals and by decreasing the water temperature and have resulted in a more than 50% reduction in fabric degradation.When clothes are worn even for a short time, a bad smell may be absorbed into the fabric, although the clothes are generally unsoiled. Examples can include adsorption of cigarette smoke into clothes, the smell of sweat, or removal of perfume traces. In this case, clothes, as a rule, don't have to be washed, but removing the adsorbed odor and killing viruses and pathogenic bacteria is required. Save time and money on dry cleaning with WONDERTOOL™, you just need to put the clothes in a plastic bag and send dry OZONE there with a silicone hose from WONDERTOOL™WONDERTOOL™ is great for dry cleaning and removing unpleasant smells (sweat, tobacco, etc.) from your clothes, shoes and other things, including children's toys (made of fabric) and pillows. On clothing and other surfaces harder to disinfect pathogenic microbes and viruses can survive up to 24 hours,  and even up to 2-3 days. But our WONDERTOOL™ also removes 99% of known pathogenic microbes and viruses. Just put the dirty items inside (without water) and set the timer for 15 minutes. Protect yourself and your family with WONDERTOOL™. WONDERTOOL ™ is ideal for cleaning even sneakers - remove these smelly smells, bacteria and viruses from your shoes yourself.Hand-washing fruits and vegetables remove only about 70% of pesticides and germs. But the ozone successfully disinfects and kills 99% of bacteria and viruses while reducing water and energy consumption. This is more difficult to do with traditional methods of washing using a lot of hot water and even bactericides in sterilization. WONDERTOOL ™ - the best bio-protection practice - keep your healthy by providing protection from agro-chemicals, bacteria, and viruses! WONDERTOOL™ in just a few minutes gently washes fruits, berries, vegetables and salad greens to 99% purity.Ozone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an antimicrobial agent in 2001 and it has since been used to combat bacteria and chemical residue.WONDERTOOL™ can prepare ozone-charged water for cleaning in the house – germs, bacteria, and viruses will be destroyed. The ozone creates a more powerful and less selective secondary oxidant, hydroxyl radicals, in the water. The free radicals hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl (OH) that are formed have a much higher oxidation potential than ozone and require even less time of contact of ozonated water with bacteria and viruses for their complete destruction. But it's necessary to use freshly prepared water, ozone very quickly returns to normal oxygen. This is the best way to ensure uncompromised cleanliness in the house. And this can't be achieved without ozone-saturated water with hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl  from WONDERTOOL™  WONDERTOOL™ sterilizes many items: kids' toys, kitchen tools, and personal hygiene products. Only one warning - ozone during a very long and repeated exposure can deteriorate rubber products. When was the last time you cleaned your razor, toothbrush, or make-up brush? With WONDERTOOL™ you can finally clean it all back to its original sterile cleanliness. After this, ozonated water is very useful to water the houseplants so you protect them from fungi and harmful microbes. WONDERTOOL™ cleans the air in the house and destroys 99% of microbes and viruses. It successfully removes unpleasant cigarette and mold smells. Remember, during the air purification process, people and animals can't be in the room, and after that, it is necessary to ventilate the room well. Everyone remembers the clean air after a thunder and lightning storm – it’s the ozone that washed it! WONDERTOOL™ will bring this wonderful natural effect into your home. WONDERTOOL™ can be connected to any home outlet (110-240 v).   WONDERTOOL™ works in manual mode - use only the on / off switch and timer. The washing time and the amount of loading should be determined by testing and your preferences. Usually, 15 minutes for washing and 5 minutes for rinsing are sufficient. It's very simple and reliable.WONDERTOOL ™ is designed for a 7/24 run time with 15 min breaks every 60 min. Use 60+ minutes to clean the air of foreign smells and infections in the house (and even your car and boat). You will get great air quality in a house without allergens, germs, dust, and therefore a better quality of life. Remember, during the air purification process, people and animals can't be in the room, and after that, it is necessary to ventilate the room well. WONDERTOOL ™ is indispensable for cleaning the car interior from odors and, more importantly, from harmful bacteria and viruses found blowing around car air conditioning systems. For this, 15-minute treatments of the passenger compartment with ozonized air are sufficient with the ventilation system running.WONDERTOOL™ can do it all, but ozone can be dangerous if handled incorrectly. Ozone is a strong oxidizer that is generally not harmful to humans and mammals at low concentrations, but homicidal to microorganisms such as bacteria. You must respect the oxidative powers of ozone and treat it accordingly. We thoroughly tested and selected the necessary power of the ozone generator so that it completely dissolves in the water. Nevertheless, some ozone will be released into the environment. Therefore, it is important to use WONDERTOOL™ together with the ventilation included and don't stay long in the same room while it works. Ozone will do its job and very quickly convert back to safeoxygen. Ozone is used in swimming pools, hospitals, and hotels for water disinfection and air freshening. It can also be used to clean industrial and domestic laundries and effectively combat pollution and save the environment from chemical detergents. Ozone has been approved by the FDA, USDA, and the EPA as antimicrobial disinfectants.SHIPPING WONDERTOOL™ is not huge (15""13""15""), but to protect the product we must package it well.

<p><strong>2. Skin-Friendly - No more allergic reaction with added comfort &amp; irresistible Touch.</strong></p>
<p>After being exposed to oxygen, water, and UV rays, the rubbers of traditional resistance bands tend to generate a layer of white residue on the surface of bands which irritate human skin, commonly resulting in an allergic reaction. Also, They often pinch and chafe your skin, causing pain and irritation which distracts you during training.</p>

We value your opinion and experience above all, we at VRTX recreated the VRTX MESH Resistance Band for a better look and feel, and more importantly, the performance. The VRTX MESH Resistance Band 2.0 showcases a smaller logo plate as well as a minor redesign, allowing for better and more consistent grip with less chances of fiber snags. Here are two main upgraded spots:1. Smaller Logo PlateThe MESH Resistance band’s prior design affected user grip due to the larger logo plate. To remedy this, we minimized the logo plate to prioritize the consistency of the grip and is situated in places where users normally wouldn’t grip the band for ease of use. 2. Improved Weaving Technique (to reduce probability of torn fibers)We’ve also improved the weaving technique to increase the band’s durability as well as its visual quality by reducing the chances of fiber snags.  Pre-order Now on Indiegogo Indemand!Get your hands on VRTX MESH 2.0 for an upgraded training experience.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are VRTX. Our aim is the perfect union of science and fitness.  And now, VRTX MESH is the first offering from our proprietary Intelli-Weave Technology range.To preorder it and bring it to life, click ""Back This Project"".Introducing VRTX MESH:  Traditional rubber bands have three main critical flaws:
After reacting with oxygen and your sweat, they generate a layer of white residue on their surface which results in allergic reactions.
They pinch your skin and skin hair while stretching.
They are prone to generate tiny tears which give a risk of snapping when deteriorating.
 That’s why we created VRTX MESH resistance band with our intelli-weave technology which is US utility patent-pending, fixing the problems, and more.How? We are fitness enthusiasts.Okay, be patient, my friends. Before we dive deeper into the features, let’s enjoy more photos of VRTX MESH.  1. Industry-Leading Structural Integrity - Train with confidence that our supreme product will endure your heaviest workouts.A common problem with the elastic rubbers of the traditional resistance bands is that they can be prone to generate tiny tears when deteriorating, or when exposed to sharp objects that are very commonly found in training environments. Once the traditional band develops even just a tiny tear, there will already be a risk of the band snapping completely, which is unsafe not only for the person using it but also for anybody training nearby.   VRTX MESH resistance band will never encounter this kind of problem because with its unique intelli-weave technology (latex rubber fiber + polyester fabric fiber), it is highly resistant to deterioration, fatigue, or physical damages due to external causes. This allows the users to stretch the band literally as far as they want, without having the fear of the band snapping.   


 
2. Skin-Friendly - No more allergic reaction with added comfort & irresistible Touch.
After being exposed to oxygen, water, and UV rays, the rubbers of traditional resistance bands tend to generate a layer of white residue on the surface of bands which irritate human skin, commonly resulting in an allergic reaction. Also, They often pinch and chafe your skin, causing pain and irritation which distracts you during training.
 

   VRTX MESH is a unique training band unlike any other. Its selected fabric texture is super-comfortable, hypoallergenic and suited perfectly for each individual so you will never have to worry about any discomfort when exercising. It also promotes good hygiene because just like your favorite training vest, you can toss it in your washing machine right after use and leave it to dry indoors and you won’t have to worry about the quality being damaged.    Believe us. Once you try VRTX MESH, you will forget the rest!  3. Earth-Friendly - We believe the environment is equally important as your health. That is why we use 44%-68% less non-biodegradable material.After rigorous experiments by the VRTX team, we have now reached the perfect union between scientific research and training comfort. We are now proud to announce that every VRTX MESH resistance band we manufacture contains 44-68% less rubber than traditional rubber bands, which is replaced by the fabric fibers. This means we generate 44-68% less non-recyclable and non-biodegradable rubber waste.   As a brand aiming to provide people with a better training regime and body health, VRTX cares very much about the world we live in. We pledge to look after not only your health and fitness but also the environment and the world we share.  4. Dimensions Now, let’s see the versatility of VRTX MESH in action, and how sport & fitness professionals trained with it!              Dear Backers, This is the first campaign that the VRTX team has launched on Indiegogo. All of our team members are sports & fitness enthusiasts with great passion in bringing people a better training life and a greener world.

They then need to be transferred from their chairs to specially configured equipment.  This is not feasible for everyone and the challenges with time, transportation, resources and lack of mobility mean that many people are not afforded this opportunity.  With the RealABSolution Disability Device, people can enjoy the benefits of a workout without having to leave their homes, making fitness more accessible to people struggling with lack of independent mobility.   It can also become a valuable addition to existing adaptive facilities, used for rehabilitation and to prevent muscle atrophy. </p><p>Your contribution will help me to take this version of the RealABSolution to the next level, protect the concept and design and pursue classification as a medical device.  The goal for the RealABSolution Disability Device is to become reimbursable through Medicaid, Medicare and private insurance, making it affordable and attainable to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay.</p><p>I am honored that you have decided to join and support me on this journey and you can rest assured that whatever your contribution, you will have a hand in helping to improve the quality of life of someone less fortunate, either through the IAM foundation or with our efforts to make fitness accessible to all.</p><p><strong>RISK AND CHALLENGES!</strong></p><p>Our biggest hurdle in bringing this product to market is being able to mass produce the machine at the lowest cost possible while maintaining quality and structural integrity.  We want to be able to deliver a product that offers long-term durability and ultimate customer satisfaction at an affordable price.  And we aim to accomplish this with a 100% Made in America product so that we can maintain control of the process, reduce time to market and bring new employment opportunities and fresh prosperity to American workers.</p><p>Low volume pre-production product fabrication is slower, more expensive and more difficult to scale.  We need to establish the manufacturing processes and procedures in place today, which will allow us to scale efficiently to larger volume orders without compromising quality.</p><p>As a contributor to this crowdfunding campaign,  you will help us reach a final production design that can meet both our performance and manufacturing goals simultaneously.  With these optimized engineering drawings in hand, we will be able to build relationships with US based manufacturers, create the tooling and testing capabilities needed for mass production and deliver a quality American made product for years to come.</p><p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP!</strong></p><p>We understand that not everyone has the resources available to support our campaign financially.  But

It also taught me the importance of having a strong core, not only for strength and speed but for quality of life.   85% of Americans suffer from some form of lower back pain.  I have used my experience as a professional athlete to develop the RealABSolution, a revolutionary core fitness trainer that can help relieve chronic back pain and provide stronger more toned abdominal muscles.ARE YOU SUFFERING FROM LOWER BACK PAIN?Weak transverse abdominis muscles are directly associated with chronic lower back pain.  These muscles are essential for the stabilization of the spine.  The RealABSolution allows for strengthening and conditioning of these muscles without unnecessary strain on the lower back. ARE YOU LOOKING TO REGAIN THAT PRE-BABY LOOK?The RealABSolution provides the support that mothers need to safely work their core during and after childbirth.  Women can quickly regain that “corset” look, lose love handles, and ensure their internal organs are adequately supported by strengthening the muscles that are often stressed, split, and lose their tone.  SHORT ON SPACE?With the addition of resistance bands, the RealABSolution becomes a compact, total body workout solution eliminating bulky home gym needs.  WHAT DOES YOUR PURCHASE MEAN?Your purchase means better self-care, a new image, and more confidence for you.  But it means so much more.  I am excited to bring you all the blessings of better health with the RealABSolution Core Fitness Trainer.  But most importantly, your support will help me on my journey to help the community that raised me.   A portion of the proceeds from the sales of the RealABSolution will help me launch the IAM foundation, focused on providing support for inner city youth.  We will provide them with food, shelter, a learning center and full gym to develop both their academic and athletic skills.  This will be a safe haven for them to return to after school, an alternative to a life in the streets, where they will be loved and guided to become contributing members of society.  Please join the RealABSolution campaign and help me to makemy dream to give back a reality! WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET?I have literally put my blood, sweat and tears into bringing this product to life for the benefit of many.   It’s now time for me to share my passion for health, happiness and quality of life through my invention, the RealABSolution.   To take this product to the next level we need your help!  Our goal of $100,000 will allow us to protect our design, build a strong marketing and digital presence to get the word out to the masses and to graduate our production into a scalable manufacturing facility to reduce our overall costs without compromising quality.For your support and generous contribution, you can be one of the first people to enjoy the benefits of the RealABSolution.  For our Gold and Platinum contributors, we have a very special perk. You will have an opportunity to spend an intense hour of training and motivation with yours truly, online or at my training facility in Las Vegas, NV.  Based on your personal goals and body type, I will provide you with some customized training tips and examples of exercises you can perform to improve your overall health and well-being. I will walk you through the RealABSolution exercise guide to ensure you have the ultimate customer experience with the product and I will share some intimate details of my story and how I arrived at where I am today.  One thing I will guarantee – you will leave this one hour session inspired and motivated to become the very best version of you - #IAM, #ICAN, #IWILL!Our Nickel, Bronze and Silver Contributors will enjoy one of our branded items – (fitness band, cap, hoodie) and if you feel like being all in, you can get all of our perk items in one Ultimate Combo package.And don’t worry if we don’t reach our campaign goals.  Your support will still help us make significant progress.  We greatly appreciate all of our contributor’s support and you can rest assured that if you see enough potential in our product to give us your hard earned money, you will receive the perks associated with your contribution 100%.  The balance of the campaign funds will be used to make more units of the RealABSolution and we will get back to basics, pounding the pavement, going from gym to gym, city to city and continuing to build a grass roots following leading to our Black Friday launch on QVC. THE IMPACT!Your contribution will of course allow us to bring the RealABSolution to the masses and help people all over the world realize the benefits of a strong core.  But in supporting our campaign you will do so much more than that.  When I invented the RealABSolution my vision was much grander than to just invent the next best ab machine.  My goal is and has always been to help people and at the onset of this journey I realized very quickly that my invention could really change people’s lives.  At some point in our lives, we have all experienced hardships.  When I see homeless people I want to be able to give them shelter.  When I know people are hungry I want to feed them.   We can all do our part to make the world a better place.  And with the RealABSolution, I quickly realized that the product had the potential to offer something impactful to people not able to effectively strengthen their core muscles because of various disabilities.   And everyone deserves the gift of exercise – especially people who are wheelchair bound.That is why I turned the RealABSolution into the world’s only fully adaptable, wheelchair mounted fitness device that allows people with disabilities to safely work their upper body and core while remaining in the comfort and security of their personal wheelchairs.   People who are confined to a wheelchair would typically need to travel to an adaptive gym or specialized physical therapy facility, in order to exercise and strengthen their muscles. They then need to be transferred from their chairs to specially configured equipment.  This is not feasible for everyone and the challenges with time, transportation, resources and lack of mobility mean that many people are not afforded this opportunity.  With the RealABSolution Disability Device, people can enjoy the benefits of a workout without having to leave their homes, making fitness more accessible to people struggling with lack of independent mobility.   It can also become a valuable addition to existing adaptive facilities, used for rehabilitation and to prevent muscle atrophy. Your contribution will help me to take this version of the RealABSolution to the next level, protect the concept and design and pursue classification as a medical device.  The goal for the RealABSolution Disability Device is to become reimbursable through Medicaid, Medicare and private insurance, making it affordable and attainable to everyone, regardless of their ability to pay.I am honored that you have decided to join and support me on this journey and you can rest assured that whatever your contribution, you will have a hand in helping to improve the quality of life of someone less fortunate, either through the IAM foundation or with our efforts to make fitness accessible to all.RISK AND CHALLENGES!Our biggest hurdle in bringing this product to market is being able to mass produce the machine at the lowest cost possible while maintaining quality and structural integrity.  We want to be able to deliver a product that offers long-term durability and ultimate customer satisfaction at an affordable price.  And we aim to accomplish this with a 100% Made in America product so that we can maintain control of the process, reduce time to market and bring new employment opportunities and fresh prosperity to American workers.Low volume pre-production product fabrication is slower, more expensive and more difficult to scale.  We need to establish the manufacturing processes and procedures in place today, which will allow us to scale efficiently to larger volume orders without compromising quality.As a contributor to this crowdfunding campaign,  you will help us reach a final production design that can meet both our performance and manufacturing goals simultaneously.  With these optimized engineering drawings in hand, we will be able to build relationships with US based manufacturers, create the tooling and testing capabilities needed for mass production and deliver a quality American made product for years to come.OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP!We understand that not everyone has the resources available to support our campaign financially.  But there is still so much you can do to help us be successful and we would greatly appreciate your help.Help us make some noise!  We all spend a great deal of time on social media and have friends, family and associates in our online communities, who follow our stories.  I would be eternally grateful if you would consider sharing the link to our campaign on your social media platforms and help us spread the word within your personal networks.Hashtags Rule!  When you post about our campaign, please be sure to use our hashtag #RealABSolution and #IAM.Follow Us!  We are also looking to build our own social media platforms.  Please follow me, Darran Hall on Facebook @DarranLHall, on LinkedIn @DarranLHall and on Instagram @RealABSolutionCore  - and be sure to like, share and comment on my posts.Help us create a buzz!  If you work-out at a gym you have direct access to our target audience, we would appreciate if you could help us create some buzz about the RealABSolution within your fitness community and if your gym has a notice board, maybe you could consider printing out and posting a copy of our campaign for other gym members to see.Help us go viral!  We can do so much more to help others if this campaign were to go viral.  If you have people in your network that have large social media followings, please share our link with them and ask them to share it within their communities.  If ten of your friends tell ten of their friends and so on, this would help us reach people that might otherwise not hear about the good we are hoping to do through this endeavor.  BOOKMARK OUR WEBSITE!  www.realabsolution.com. Use share tools to spread the word!  Indiegogo makes it easy for you to tell others about our campaign.  Using the Indiegogo share tools, you can simply copy and paste a link to your social media pages, into an email, on blogs and on other digital platforms to lead people right back to our campaign.However you decide to help, I will be forever grateful for your support.  Welcome to the RealABSolution Family!",6.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Superior Hydration using Science</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Powered by cutting-edge 4D Purification™ technology that treats your water by first using dual UVC LEDs to destroy viruses, bacteria, and pathogens. Second, it filters your water by using a proprietary blend filter cartridge system to remove metals, chemicals, organic and particulate matter. Lastly, it uses a natural blend of minerals to add a crisp taste-just like artesian water.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">4D Purification™ combines the traditional filtration system with a time-dependent variable. In conventional filtration systems, water is treated in 3-Dimensions as it travels through the filter's XYZ planes and has no significant time-dependent variable. With our 4D Purification™ system, the UVC treatment adds a significant time-dependent purification BEFORE the water passes through the filter cartridge system, creating a revolutionary 4th Dimension in water purification with a germicidal efficacy of up to 99.999999%.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">3D water purification occurs as water travels through the XYZ axis of the coconut charcoal + ion-exchange filter. 4D Purification™ elevates this process by treating the water using UVC LED light for a specific time period. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Over the years, scientific studies have shown the effectiveness of UV light in disinfecting surfaces. Most recently, scientists discovered that a particular portion of this UV spectrum, UVC, has maximum germicidal efficacy. With the very modest power of UVC, you can disinfect a surface more effectively than traditional high-powered UV systems. Our products use this particular UVC region of the spectrum to achieve a maximum neutralizing effect up to 99.999999% against a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, and pathogens.</p>

Filter cartridge: Removes microplastics, particulates, chemical, and metal impurities.
 
Superior Hydration using Science
Powered by cutting-edge 4D Purification™ technology that treats your water by first using dual UVC LEDs to destroy viruses, bacteria, and pathogens. Second, it filters your water by using a proprietary blend filter cartridge system to remove metals, chemicals, organic and particulate matter. Lastly, it uses a natural blend of minerals to add a crisp taste-just like artesian water.
 


 
 

4D Purification™ combines the traditional filtration system with a time-dependent variable. In conventional filtration systems, water is treated in 3-Dimensions as it travels through the filter's XYZ planes and has no significant time-dependent variable. With our 4D Purification™ system, the UVC treatment adds a significant time-dependent purification BEFORE the water passes through the filter cartridge system, creating a revolutionary 4th Dimension in water purification with a germicidal efficacy of up to 99.999999%.
3D water purification occurs as water travels through the XYZ axis of the coconut charcoal + ion-exchange filter. 4D Purification™ elevates this process by treating the water using UVC LED light for a specific time period. 



Over the years, scientific studies have shown the effectiveness of UV light in disinfecting surfaces. Most recently, scientists discovered that a particular portion of this UV spectrum, UVC, has maximum germicidal efficacy. With the very modest power of UVC, you can disinfect a surface more effectively than traditional high-powered UV systems. Our products use this particular UVC region of the spectrum to achieve a maximum neutralizing effect up to 99.999999% against a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, and pathogens.

 Only bottle powered with 2X 20mW UVC LEDsWe know filters are not ""one size fits all"". So, we designed the cartridge to be easily interchangeable to accommodate a variety of cartridges that we will be introducing in the near future. We designed our first three sets of cartridges to satisfy your thirst: 1) PURIST - filter for the purists,  2) ARTESIAN - filter for the idealists, and 3) ALKALINE - filter for hydration enthusiasts.The foundation/bed of all three filter cartridges consists of a proprietary blend of coconut charcoal and ion-exchange resin. Coconut charcoal is designed to capture organic molecules and chlorine effectively. Ion-exchange resin is designed to capture ions in water (non-organic). This process is very effective in reducing the hardness of the water.Note: Filter cartridges are optional. One can use WAATR bottles only in UVC purification mode.The WAATR filter cartridge system consists of a proprietary blend of coconut charcoal and ion-exchange resin. Coconut charcoal is a highly porous organic material designed to capture organic molecules and chlorine effectively. Ion-exchange resin is a spherical porous bead resin material designed to exchange ions (inorganics) in water for other ions fixed in the resin. This process is very effective for reducing the hardness of the water.We value the world we live in. That's why, at WAATR, our mission is to go beyond purification by providing knowledge and information about the contaminants lurking in your drinking water. We do this by studying your used WAATR filter cartridges. Simply ship your used filters to our facility. Our scientists will analyze them carefully and provide you with a detailed lab report so that you can take preventative measures to limit exposure to harmful contaminants if they are present in your source water. Filter analysis is a paid service (the US only):It will cost $49 to get the filter analyzed by one of our expert scientists. Once users sign up for the service online, they will receive prepaid postage to mail the filters to our laboratory.Filter analysis service for the rest of the world will be rolled out by the end of 2022. We are currently speaking to several laboratories around the globe to get your filters analyzed locally to save on shipping.  Water + Purification + Analytics = WAATR No more funky-smelling bottle. WAATR bottle cleans itself by blasting UVC light every hour for 20 seconds each to keep your bottle free of mold, bacteria, viruses, etc.(Note: This feature can be disabled to conserve battery life)Thanks to the wide-mouth of the WAATR bottle, you can insert objects as big as a cell phone and sterilize them with UVC LEDs in a matter of minutes.  Toss in your dirty cell phone, face masks, keys, utensils, etc., to quickly neutralize the germs lurking on their surface. Perfect for travel and quick on-the-go sanitizing applications.The WAATR bottle performs many functions. With its built-in RGB status indicators, you'll know exactly what it's doing. When it's running low on battery, it will glow RED; when it purifies your water, it will pulse BLUE; when it's reminding you to hydrate, it will pulse GREEN.   It is vital to drink water daily for optimal health and body function. Water helps regulate body temperature, keeps joints lubricated, helps prevent infections, delivers nutrients to cells, and helps keep organs functioning properly. Being well-hydrated also improves sleep quality, cognition, and mood. With the WAATR bottle, the Smart Hydration Reminder will alert you every 30 minutes to take a sip for optimal hydration. It automatically turns ON/OFF the reminders based on your bottle usage.After a hot summer day at the park or a killer workout at the gym, nothing feels as rewarding as drinking icy-cold water.  Hydrating with room temperature water is just not as satisfying as a chilled beverage. WAATR's wide-mouth bottle makes it easy to add some ice to your water for a refreshingly cold sip of water when you need it most.  Triple Insulated DesignA proprietary vacuum insulation technology keeps contents arctic cold for up to 36 hrs. *Note: Due to the filter cartridge, we don't recommend our bottles for hot contents. Pro-Grade Stainless Steel MaterialPro-grade stainless steel (18/8) is durably constructed and ensures no flavor transfer from the bottle into the water. Powder-Coated Sweat-Proof FinishProvides a comfortable and slip-free grip. Six Amazing ColorsColor options will be available on post-campaign surveys.One Cap for Any Size WAATR BottleDepending on your usage, you can upgrade or downgrade your WAATR bottle size.

  Some of the boys involved have raised money for Alzheimer's Society and Mind previously. We felt it would be a nice touch to donate £1 for every backer supporting us.      Pictured above is our lens range. You will notice that each lens takes a different colour. The major reason for this is specific light frequencies affect bodily functions in different ways.The colour perception has to change to different degrees, depending on the range that needs to be blocked. Each lens has unique use cases. We go into some detail in the next section.  Whether you’re an office professional or are simply an individual who is susceptible to suffer from “square eyes” and eye strain when looking at laptop and phone screens - these lenses offer the perfect relief. They help you combat headaches, eye and head fatigue and prevent ‘Computer Vision Syndrome’ - a 21st Century illness that develops from overexposure to blue light-emitting technology in our modern lives.  Looking for something which ticks all the boxes?

<p>We designed the RXT-1 with three training modes to be a complete in-home fighting Coach.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Practice Mode</strong> — designed to get you accustomed to the rhythm and flow of striking, using the RXT-1 to drill specific techniques. This mode can be used by beginners and professional fighters alike.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spar Mode</strong> — this is your personal sparring partner. Get the convenience of waking up in the morning and getting a few spar rounds in before going to work, or in the evening before you relax.</li>
<li>
<strong>Combination Mode</strong> — Master over 100+ pre-programmed striking combinations. Now you can practice at any time without the risk of injury, as the RXT-1 is low-impact and ready to go at any time!</li>

<p> </p>
<p>""Learn"" Mode, also called ""practice"" mode is the foundation of training on the RXT-1. It is designed for both beginner and advanced users to train one specific striking technique at a time. The RXT-1 strikes at the user in a consistent pattern every two seconds, which allows you to drill counters, dodges, and defense tactics as well as offense. Practice mode is easy to learn, but can never be mastered!</p>

<p>STRYK's founder, Brent Verdialez, served ten years in US Army Special Forces. His MMA background began with Kung Fu and later he trained in Muay Thai. After sustaining a wrist injury, Brent had the inspiration to invent the RXT-1 as a low-impact, high-intensity exercise device with huge potential. The RXT-1 allowed him to effectively train and maintain fitness without risking injury to his wrist, and he realized the value of this device for anyone who wants to train at home.</p>

The RXT-1 Fight Coach Robot
 


 

 


 



 
 
Work on reflexes, reaction time, and cognitive processing for athletes. The RXT-1 “Combo Mode” feature allows users to strike the arm pads to practice various combinations. This trains your eye-hand coordination, speed, and agility all while getting a more engaging cardio workout. Another emphasis of the RXT-1 is its low impact and can be used in limited space - making it ideal for home use.
 

 
 
 

 
 

 
Can the RXT-1 take a punch from a pro?
Yes! Want proof? 
Watch Jeff Chan (ONE Championship MMA Athlete), with over 274K subscribers on YouTube demonstrate the durability of the RXT-1 robot and see how he uses it to train!
Here's the link to his demo video on Instagram (@MMAshredded - 148K followers) Here's another recent example, featuring Taekwondo black belt and Gymshark pro athlete Samuel Ericsson (@EricssonSamuel - 531K followers). Watch as he proves how the RXT-1 can take a (hard!) punch from an MMA pro!
 

 
 

 

 
We designed the RXT-1 with three training modes to be a complete in-home fighting Coach.

Many of you have told us that you wanted to practice body strikes with the RXT-1, so we worked hard in designing and testing the torso pad just for you.

STRYK's founder, Brent Verdialez, served ten years in US Army Special Forces. His MMA background began with Kung Fu and later he trained in Muay Thai. After sustaining a wrist injury, Brent had the inspiration to invent the RXT-1 as a low-impact, high-intensity exercise device with huge potential. The RXT-1 allowed him to effectively train and maintain fitness without risking injury to his wrist, and he realized the value of this device for anyone who wants to train at home.

<p>In order for a muscle to contract, your brain has to send an electrical impulse to neurons in muscle fibers. By applying electrode pads to different parts of muscle, Cardlax sends a small electrical impulse to a muscle that tells it to contract. That's why EMS is particularly useful for people who have tense and sore muscle. </p>
<p><strong>The purpose of EMS devices are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To help build your muscle strength.</li>
<li>To help with muscle recovery after exercise. </li>
<li>To help with improving your overall training efficiency.</li>
<li>To help relieve pain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cardlax has four main massage-like modes: </p>
<p> <strong>- An unique fitness mode - Shred</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Knock       2. Malaxate       3. Rub       4. Knead</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608012312/twj6hwafeyfffjxnbufs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A new fitness mode, Shred. Specifically designed for people who want stronger, higher-frequency currents to get a full muscle contraction during or after their workouts. Small wave of short pulses stimulate your muscles, pulses gradually accelerates and become more powerful. The deeper, more intense muscular contractions can have positive effects in building muscle and help you on your body building journey.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s8.gifyu.com/images/c3c5cc082e3451adf88fe19880b8fa70_original.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>* Disclaimer: Electric pulse stimulation can help build muscle mass in conjunction with proper workout and nutrition. It will not do it FOR you. In Shred mode, you may experience uncomfortable or intense contractions.</i></p>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608012810/uwdpnkr7yo4cxdxhrgjp.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>
<p>In the Knock mode, short but strong pulses stimulate your muscles. Every 3 “knocks” are followed by an interval and this mode is perfect for soreness of muscles. Remember to turn down the intensity level if it starts to feel too strong.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s8.gifyu.com/images/40c75012c4f9d71b8.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Malaxate mode causes small muscle contractions and it feels like the currents first hit the center of the stimulated area and then spread out to the surrounding area. The electric signals are sent out every second, gently soothing your pain.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s8.gifyu.com/images/58f4a74ff5405dc10.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>If you change it to the Rub mode, you will have a similar sensation to Malaxate. In this mode, small and then stronger pulsations that last a total 6 seconds are alternating, with a stop of 2 seconds. Every few rounds are mixed with equally intense stimulations on the both sides.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s8.gifyu.com/images/68b4b9ba7f1ed425c.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The last one is Knead. This mode brings you the feeling of someone slowly but firmly kneading your muscles, with a contraction like your stimulated parts are being pulled. A round of kneading lasts around 2 seconds, helping your muscles recover better.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s8.gifyu.com/images/dcdb30318d47d584446128e5af025f03_original.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other three are combination modes: </p>
<p><strong>6. Knock + Malaxate       7. Knock + Rub        8. Knock + Knead. </strong></p>
<p>Each one of them helps relieve your pain and stress with 10 adjustable intensity levels. </p>

<p>We're Cardlax Team and this is our 2nd Kickstarter project. After our first campaign, we believed Cardlax still had room for improvement and the funds we raised on Kickstarter made it possible for us to keep developing products so we decided to upgrade Cardlax and finally now we’re able to launch Cardlax 2.0! </p>

Why do we have different feelings when we use Cardlax?</span></p><p>Under specific functions and intensity setting, EMS wherein the device for certain purposes may be more or less effective.</p></div>","Boasting a slim exterior only 4.5 mm thick, Cardlax 2.0 is apersonal massager designed on the mechanism of Electrical Muscle Stimulation so it fully serves the needs of both relaxing and strengthening your muscles. Despite its tiny size, this card massager is powerful enough to carry 8 modes and 10 intensity levels, allowing you to have amazing massage sessions.    
 
See how Physical Therapists thinks of our product:

In order for a muscle to contract, your brain has to send an electrical impulse to neurons in muscle fibers. By applying electrode pads to different parts of muscle, Cardlax sends a small electrical impulse to a muscle that tells it to contract. That's why EMS is particularly useful for people who have tense and sore muscle. 
The purpose of EMS devices are:

To help build your muscle strength.
To help with muscle recovery after exercise. 
To help with improving your overall training efficiency.
To help relieve pain.

 

 
Cardlax has four main massage-like modes: 
 - An unique fitness mode - Shred
1. Knock       2. Malaxate       3. Rub       4. Knead
 

A new fitness mode, Shred. Specifically designed for people who want stronger, higher-frequency currents to get a full muscle contraction during or after their workouts. Small wave of short pulses stimulate your muscles, pulses gradually accelerates and become more powerful. The deeper, more intense muscular contractions can have positive effects in building muscle and help you on your body building journey.

* Disclaimer: Electric pulse stimulation can help build muscle mass in conjunction with proper workout and nutrition. It will not do it FOR you. In Shred mode, you may experience uncomfortable or intense contractions.

In the Knock mode, short but strong pulses stimulate your muscles. Every 3 “knocks” are followed by an interval and this mode is perfect for soreness of muscles. Remember to turn down the intensity level if it starts to feel too strong.

 

 
The Malaxate mode causes small muscle contractions and it feels like the currents first hit the center of the stimulated area and then spread out to the surrounding area. The electric signals are sent out every second, gently soothing your pain.

 

 
If you change it to the Rub mode, you will have a similar sensation to Malaxate. In this mode, small and then stronger pulsations that last a total 6 seconds are alternating, with a stop of 2 seconds. Every few rounds are mixed with equally intense stimulations on the both sides.

 

 
The last one is Knead. This mode brings you the feeling of someone slowly but firmly kneading your muscles, with a contraction like your stimulated parts are being pulled. A round of kneading lasts around 2 seconds, helping your muscles recover better.

 
The other three are combination modes: 
6. Knock + Malaxate       7. Knock + Rub        8. Knock + Knead. 
Each one of them helps relieve your pain and stress with 10 adjustable intensity levels. 
* The gif shown above is a simulation of hand massage for Cardlax.
 

 

To use Cardlax in wired mode, attach the wire to the electrode plate and place the gel pads directly on your skin of the body part you want to massage.
Power on the device and press the + button to increase the intensity and the - button to decrease intensity. Press M to change modes.

​​

 

 
Sitting for long periods of time has become an increasingly large problem for employees. You are more likely to experience neck, shoulder, arm, and back pain. Cardlax is a great option for portable, easy, and quick massaging to relieve stress and muscle tension in seconds. It is also small and discreet!

 

 
We're Cardlax Team and this is our 2nd Kickstarter project. After our first campaign, we believed Cardlax still had room for improvement and the funds we raised on Kickstarter made it possible for us to keep developing products so we decided to upgrade Cardlax and finally now we’re able to launch Cardlax 2.0! 

 

 
 











 

 



 

 
 
 
 
Cardlax 2.0 has been upgraded to include an extension cord for better usability and now has washable gel pads to last longer for you. Even though we added a wired mode, you can still use Cardlax wirelessly, too, to go hands-free. You can use Cardlax anywhere on your body to stimulate your muscles, though some of the best-suited areas are your waist, arms, calves, shoulder, and neck.
  After intense workouts, your muscles are tight and overtaxed. Use Cardlax to help relax your muscles and feel great after working out. Don’t forget, you can change the modes and intensity levels to find the right level of comfort for you.     
  ​    While other massagers can be large and bulky, hard to carry with you, Cardlax is small and extremely portable. It fits in your pocket, purse, and even your wallet!    
 
 With the Cardlax 2.0, we have upgraded the material that holds the gel pads from plastic (Cardlax 1.0)  to synthetic leather. The leather is not only more comfortable for your skin, it also makes the pads easier to maintain and lasts longer. To remove dust and dirt from your gel pads, simply rinse with water and let them dry completely.Gel pads for EMS units usually last for 4 to 6 months, and wear off after 50 - 60 rounds of use.  
  Cardlax is a great affordable gift for anyone in your life! 
An EMS(Electronic Muscle Stimulator) unit delivers low voltage electric impulses to stimulate the nerves and help in pain management.
A massage gun sends direct vibrating pulses through your muscles and is used to ease tight muscles and temporarily increase circulation.

 
 After our first Kickstarter project, we have learned more experience in handling supply and production. Now our molds required for production are ready, production has been tested and passed quality control procedures. We can say with certainty, we are ready to produce when the fund is ready. Have a look at our mold :)
 
 
 
    
 The gel pads can be purchased as an add-on (same for big gel pads).

 Based off Delaware and Hong Kong, we're a small team of designers and engineers but we hold a big dream for the innovative products we created. The amazing journey of our previous campaign on Kickstarter made us set foot on another adventure of bringing a project to life. With portable gadegets like Cardlax, we bring ease to people's life.

What is the PledgeBox Survey?PledgeBox is a third-party backer management platform that handles the survey for our campaign, after the campaign ends PledgeBox will send out a survey where you will be able to add any add-ons, update your shipping information.It will take PledgeBox a few weeks to send out the survey.However, we will take responsibility for defective products. Just contact our customer service, at hello@cardlax.net.20. Can I use Gel Pads from other devices on Cardlax?Theoretically, Yes you can. But our gel pads are connected magnetically, we can’t guarantee gel pads from other devices will work on Cardlax.21. How do I get more Gel Pads after the project ends?Yes, we will have our online/Amazon store later on, you can get more gel pads over there.22: What about VAT or import tax?Our product price does NOT include VAT or import tax of your country. But we’ll try our best to declare a comparatively reasonable value for the product. Due to the customs policy of different countries, we CANNOT guarantee if there is a tax for you. From our previous experience, the following countries/regions haven’t been charged for import tax including the U.S, Singapore, HongKong, Japan, China, South Korea, and other EU countries such as Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and Canada. There is a chance you might be taxed, but the chance of getting taxed is very low right now, our parcel is very small and is highly unlikely to be charged. Please be aware of that. If you have further questions, please feel free to email us at hello@cardlax.net, thank you.23. What is the best way to contact the Cardlax Team?Is tough for us to reply directly in the comment section. Also, some problems are better discussed individually.You can either:1: Write us an email to hello@cardlax.net.2: Send us a message on KickStarter.24.  What is your refund policy?Orders from 'backers' are not considered as 'purchases', but rather a contribution with a 'reward' in return for believing in and for funding the project. That's why refunds of contributions are not available for our project on this platform.The support we get from our backers is what enables us to grow and choose crowdfunding as our business model.25. Why do we have different feelings when we use Cardlax?Under specific functions and intensity setting, EMS wherein the device for certain purposes may be more or less effective.",70.0,10,"3 Campaigns

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the worldwide backers, many great product ideas come true, including the Stemoscope. Now we need your help to make a great wireless stethoscope that works without breaking the social distance rule, but still can be iconic for every doctor. We have successfully brought the Stemoscope to the world and provide people opportunities to listen to the sound of life. We have extended experience in designing, developing and manufacturing medical devices. Our team also successfully got FDA clearance on a medical device in the past. With your help, we are confident that we can deliver the Stemoscope PRO to you and the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In real life, risks sometimes can not be avoided but can be managed. Though we have designed the Stemoscope PRO and successfully built the fully functional samples, there could still be some technical challenges in high volume manufacturing. Though we have a solid plan to submit an application to FDA for clearance, nobody in the world can guarantee a timeline on the clearance – the FDA is a government! However, our plan and preparation can help. As an engineering team, we are ready to solve the potential manufacturing problems as we did in the past 20 years. As the experts in the acoustics science and biomedical engineering, we are prepared to overcome all the potential challenges.</p>

The Stemoscope brand has been widely featured by the world wide media since the first day.

And the normal version of the Stemoscope has been reviewed by many medical professionals.







In your busy daily practice, you might not be willing to pull out your smartphone to auscultate your patients. You can forget the smartphone now. In Wireless Mode I, Stemoscope PRO directly transmits the auscultatory sounds to Bluetooth earphones or hearing aids. Most popular TWS earphones and Apple AirPods are supported. It is the first truly wireless stethoscope and no smartphone is needed to use it if you like. This makes your life safer and easier because every extra step could increase the chance of infection. Simply slide the switch of the Stemoscope PRO to the left and wear your Bluetooth earphones to auscultate. 

Simple Steps to use with Bluetooth earphones

Listen while keep a safe social distance
The tubeless and wireless feature provides some advantage and freedom on distance auscultation. You can even fix it on a selfie stick to keep the safe social distance. 

Hold Stemoscope PRO with a plastic bag
The tubeless and wireless feature also makes it easy to put the Stemoscope PRO in a one-time plastic bag. The Stemoscope PRO is so sensitive that the audio quality is not affected by the plastic bag.


Hospitals and clinics can be busy and noisy. Sometimes it is hard to hear clearly with a traditional stethoscope. Advanced noise cancelling technology used in Stemoscope PRO can help you hear more clearly by attenuating ambient noise magically while amplifying the heart or lung sounds, making the sounds clear.

Let's listen to the sound samples without and with noise cancelling in this video.
 
The complicated structures of a stethoscope such as tubes and earpieces are difficult to be cleaned. Stemoscope PRO is designed for easy cleaning. Normally you can use an alcohol wipe to clean it. If you think it is not thorough, you may bath it with alcohol solution. It is designed to be water and alcohol proof, the first of this type. Please make sure it is turned off and don't move the switch before it is dried.

 

Nowadays everything gets ""smart"" through Apps. Slide the switch to the right to enter Wireless Mode II and unleashes the power of the Stemoscope PRO with the Apps we designed.

<h3>Return Policy</h3>
<p>Indiegogo is a platform where innovators offer their creations at discounted prices. Funds raised are for launching the product and covering the costs of production. As per Indiegogo's Terms of Use, we will not offer refunds for leggings that are not defective. We will allow for one exchange of size (returned leggings must be unworn and still have tags attached) with the backer covering shipping costs. For exchanges, please contact help@maatactive.com. Please note, if you are unsure of which size to order, email help@maatactive.com and we will do our best to assist you and hopefully avoid unnecessary exchanges. </p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Although this is MAÄT's first crowd funding campaign, we are confident that we can deliver our leggings as promised, on time. We have taken our time developing this product in order to get it right, and as a result, have had time to develop strong working relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers. We made the decision to delay the launch of this campaign in order to do a first production run so that we could experience and more fully anticipate any issues that could potentially arise throughout the production process.

<p>Our manufacturers are all in the USA, so we have minimized our exposure to global disruptions. That said, it is not possible to completely eliminate all exposure, especially during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>We promise complete transparency with our backers. If any unexpected issues arise, we will clearly communicate the issue(s) with our backers along with our clear plan of action.</p>
<p>Our suppliers and manufacturers are all highly respected in their industries and have each been in business for a minimum of 30 years. Throughout our development process they have been extremely reliable and when an issue has arisen, extremely responsive. We are confident in their abilities to meet deadlines. Our mentor, Cheyann Benedict, is an expert in navigating quick, explosive growth. Within 3 months of launching her first fashion company, C&amp;C California, the brand found itself on Oprah's list of favorite things. Sales skyrocketed and Cheyann quickly learned how to accelerate production to meet off the charts demand. C&amp;C was sold to Liz Claiborne within 2 years, making it the youngest company to ever be acquired. In the event that we far exceed our funding goal, we are confident that with Cheyann's expertise and experience, we will be able to stick to our timeline.</p>

At the same time, its patent-pending posture shaper structure gently lifts the front of your chest into a power pose that eliminates slouching in a way no other chairs can.This unique approach stacks your spine into an upright and relaxed posture, with minimal muscle force required to maintain this perfect balance.Enyware does not lock the body in one posture. You are still free to write, look through the microscope, or create a work of art. Enyware will continuously support your body, reducing the spine's load and returning you to the zero-stress posture whenever you need it. Your phone, iPad, laptop, and joypad require your arms and shoulders to be in different positions, but most armrests are set too far apart or at the wrong height to support modern devices.These poorly designed armrests force us into awkward postures. One side was leaning to use a phone, slouching down to find armrest support when typing, or bending our neck down to view the tablet contents.Enyware's dynamic, detachable armrest is created as the result of our research and forms a critical part of the total support your body needs at work.Our armrest is adjustable to let the elbows rest at the right height to reinforce your ""zero-stress"" upright posture.It moves out to support your arms when typing or moves in create a support platform to let both hands hold phones & tablets at a healthy eye level, so you don't need to bend down.With your neck properly aligned and the shoulders relaxed, shoulder pain and text neck risks are greatly reduced.  Combining dynamic armrest with the zero-stress posture is how Enyware provides total support to the body and helps transform your posture away from the ergonomic pain affecting most of us today.Even with Enyware’s zero-stress sitting posture and dynamic armrest, static posture for long stretches of time is still unhealthy.To encourage dynamic sitting, we integrate a sensor into Enyware to be your habit coach throughout the day. Enyware tracks your torso movement and angle, so it knows if you are sitting still for too long or too reliant on the forward support.Choose to set active time goals and reminders to get up for a short stretch. Since Enyware is smart enough to know if you have left the seat or shifted posture, it will send a nudge only when necessary. Enyware lets you set active goals and work with you either through app and browser notification, or a single report at the end of the day. Enyware can remind you to periodically alternate between inclined seating in the backrest and perching on the seat. The perching posture opens the hip to the optimal 135 degrees, engages the core muscles, and further reduces tension on your spine. With the support provided by Enyware, you can perch more comfortably for longer. By putting you in control of your health goals, Enyware provides the positive reinforcement you need to transform sedentary habits into a more active lifestyle.Enyware is the world’s first smart seat that considers both the physical and mental aspects of sitting.While our physical support helps you achieve a “zero-stress” sitting posture. Our intelligent system also gives you a powerful tool to reach a “zero-stress” state of mind.Integrated with Enyware's posture shaper is a sensor that calculates your breathing rate and even detects stress based on your breathing pattern. Breathing is a conscious act that can create dramatic changes in your body. It can increase the oxygen level in the bloodstream and reduce stress without the need for medication. Now with Enyware, you will see your breathing rate and set a stress alarm in case of elevated breathing. Pick a technique to help manage your stress in the same way top executives employ mindful breathing to boost their performance. As a society, we are obsessed with how many calories we burn and what muscle group we exercise from just 1 hour in the gym. But we believe what we do during 8 hours of sitting is no less important and should be intelligently managed by you.Enyware makes sitting as intelligent as our other devices, not to distract you with another piece of technology, but to help your body and mind live in the same moment, and enriching both.Enyware lets you take the zero-stress sitting experience any where. All you need is an even surface, and Enyware will turn your place into an ergonomic space.Enyware weighs only 2.6 kg and is easily portable, so you can use it in your kitchen chair for work and easily put it away during meals.   Freeing up the need to place out-of-place furniture like an office chair in your living space.Just about everything about Enyware is adjustable. You can change the pan size, height, and depth of the posture shaper to fit your body type snugly. Its armrest is also detachable depending on your needs and sitting style.We designed Enyware for the masses. We took great care to test Enyware with a sample various people of all sex, body size, and ethnicity to ensure maximum comfort and support It would be best if you had ergonomics everywhere, and Enyware makes that possible, any where. Enyware was vigorously tested with medical-grade motion capture sensors and EMG to measure both the participant’s posture and muscle strain over a 30-minute sitting session simulating tasks performed by modern workers.The result proves that using Enyware can help you sit upright for much longer while imposing only half the muscle strain compared to sitting upright without support.In time-lapsed comparisons, participants can keep the optimal spine posture without slouching throughout the entire testing period, with better neck and shoulder alignment.The EMG results show that our “zero-stress” posture imposes only half the strain on the lower back muscle (Thoracolumbar fascia) and middle back muscle (Trapezius) when compared to sitting upright without support.Even better, sitting upright with Enyware strains your muscle less than slumping.This impressive result has been repeated both under laboratory conditions and in real-world scenarios with our beta testers.  In 2018, our team made the LEX Bionic chair and the kind people of Kickstarter made LEX the most crowdfunded wearable robotics product ever.

Snoring occurs due to the contraction of the airways, causing vibrations in the throat muscles. The device’s currents redirect these muscles, move the tongue and dilate the airway to allow easy breathing - all whilst the user sleeps!








The ZEUS device has been trialled by sleep disorder breathing charity: Hope2Sleep.
Here are what a few of their members thought of ZEUS...



ZEUS is a device for use in the home to alleviate snoring associated with the soft palette and tonsils, which adheres under the chin.

The device is not effective for sufferers of nasal snoring, as this device specifically targets the snoring caused by the tongue muscle relaxing in the throat.

<p>Our Story</p>
<p>3 years ago I was in Buffalo, NY for my job (as a Professional Baseball Umpire)  and Haley came out for a short weekend visit. Whenever Haley comes to visit, we always make it a point to stop in at a local gym to get in a workout together. We dropped in that day and spent a solid 10 minutes looking for something to warmup with, after finally finding a pvc pipe. On our way back to the hotel we thought to ourselves, “Finding a tool to warmup with just shouldn’t be that difficult. Why isn’t there something better?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The idea of RomRod was born on that walk back to the hotel. We realized that what we wanted didn’t exist and that we were going to be the ones who invented it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Putting it on paper</p>
<p>That afternoon, as we ate lunch, we began discussing all the possible features we would want in a rod mobility fitness device. Haley and I had just started our fitness journey in CrossFit. So, naturally I was infatuated with all the different Olympic lifts used in CrossFit and wanted to perfect my technique.</p>
<p>Haley, whom had previously had a shoulder surgery from an injury suffered while playing high school sports, needed to improve her mobility so she could rack a barbell on her back. These reasons are why we loved incorporating a stick or rod into our warmup routine.</p>
<p>But, the question was, ""How do we make this tool portable?"" My career requires me to be on the road almost 200 days a year. And, Haley comes out to visit about every 2-3 weeks. So, portability was definitely a priority.</p>
<p>We made a list of those necessary features and began sketching possible designs. The device needed to be lightweight, short enough that could fit in any bag, and provided similar elements of a barbell (knurling, dimensions, and feel). I can't tell you how many times we drew and redrew all possible design concepts, that next couple days.</p>

<p>When we thought we had nailed down a design concept, we started speaking to an engineer. Wow, were we mistaken about our progress. Our amazing engineer came back to us with problems, solutions, and of course suggestions. Through our knowledge and background in fitness and his expertise in product design, we came up with a working concept ready to be prototyped. This would be the first prototype of 10 (or so... I think we have kind of lost count). We were so excited when we were able to get our hands on that first 3D printed plastic prototype.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was Haley and I's first experience with designing a product. So, of course, we didn't nail it on our initial attempt. But, it didn't matter. We now knew what it took to go from paper to physical product. And, that was a small victory.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each prototype has been a learning experience. Some days were very disappointing and others were ultimate highs. The hardest days were those waiting in anticipation for that next prototype to be delivered from the 3D printers or the production facility we have hired to manufacture our first bulk order.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have made it, but it wasn't overnight!</p>
<p>From numerous attempts at an aluminum prototype we are proud of, has come something we can not wait to share. Our manufacturer is currently in production of our first bulk order. Below is a sneak peak of our ready to sell Patent Pending RomRod in its packaging.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Through the prototyping stage, we have tested RomRod with all different types of athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and even people just wanting to work on their mobility or recover from an injury. Their feedback and suggestions have been considered and implemented; helping us reach this point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The molds have been created for the different parts. Our packaging is complete. And, a free RomRod carry bag is included with each purchase.

We spent the last three years designing the perfect rod mobility device.
 
Through feedback and personal experience we have designed a patent pending training tool that you can use literally anywhere.
 
Inconvenience is not an excuse anymore.



Our Story
3 years ago I was in Buffalo, NY for my job (as a Professional Baseball Umpire)  and Haley came out for a short weekend visit. Whenever Haley comes to visit, we always make it a point to stop in at a local gym to get in a workout together. We dropped in that day and spent a solid 10 minutes looking for something to warmup with, after finally finding a pvc pipe. On our way back to the hotel we thought to ourselves, “Finding a tool to warmup with just shouldn’t be that difficult. Why isn’t there something better?”
 
The idea of RomRod was born on that walk back to the hotel. We realized that what we wanted didn’t exist and that we were going to be the ones who invented it.
 
Putting it on paper

So, naturally I was infatuated with all the different Olympic lifts used in CrossFit and wanted to perfect my technique.

<p><strong>Worldwide Component Shortages</strong></p>
<p>After working on R&amp;D for over 1.5 years on this project, we've seen firsthand the issues caused by worldwide shortages in both semiconductors and microchips.  This is causing serious component lead-time delays which are affecting nearly all major production focused industries.  We have mitigated this as much as possible by placing an advanced order for all of the components required in order to fulfil the first batch of monitors. </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19</strong><br/>The global pandemic is still causing ongoing issues with shipping and logistics worldwide. We are always keeping an eye on the latest developments, but right now, there is a delay risk to shipping should your country or region or our manufacturing partners encounter new local restrictions. </p>
<p><strong>Communication Protocol:</strong> any lead time issues or shipment delays will be communicated to the community as quickly as possible.</p>

</div></div>","MyPet is a powerful, functional & accurate monitor that will follow everything from your pet’s location and activity to more in-depth information surrounding their vital signs and behaviour levels.  All of your pet's information will be accessible via a monitoring app, where pet owners will get insightful health alerts and recommendations when the device detects changes in your pet’s data. MyPetGo is designed to help pet owners like you understand exactly how your pet is feeling while saving you time by connecting you to trusted local pet care services if any issues arise.

                                                                    

 
We help you identify potential risks and alert you to any sudden changes.  

                                                            
 
Never lose sight of your pet again and get access to a wide range of location features. 

 


 



Once you've ordered your monitor and it's arrived in the post, activating it couldn't be simpler!
                        
Each monitor comes with a 1-month data trial, where you can have some time to think about your preferred plans. At the end of the trial period, you can choose from the following options listed below. For those who do not select a plan at the end of the trial period, we will default to the monthly-rolling $9.99 data plan.
 
.                

                                                   

 
We've built a robust monitor, designed to withstand the elements:






We're well underway for a launch this year! Check out our project timeline below and follow our journey:


This is just the beginning! We have big plans coming up, here is how we plan to redefine the pet tech space:

We’re an international team of animal lovers headquartered in Singapore, Vietnam and Barcelona and we want to help pet owners become more responsible so their pets can live happy healthy and long-lasting lives.  For a long time, there has been a disconnect between the natural and technological worlds, so we’ve made it our mission to bridge this gap by creating a two-way dialogue between animals and humans. We hope our product will pave the way for future developments bringing us even closer to communicating with our pets.


We carefully selected Herald Datanetics Ltd as our manufacturing partner due to their vast experience with building IoT products, wearables and other connected devices. As a financial partner and shareholder in our business, they have consulted us every step of the way, helping us hit our development milestones, whilst future-proofing our product through rigorous testing and due diligence throughout each development phase.  
A credible Hong-Kong listed company with many years working in this field, we have formed a formidable partnership and look forward to moving onto DVT phase, where the product inches ever closer to mass production.

we first looked at personal air purification products and PPE the availability of options was limited and the technology ancient. Surgical masks were only a cheap consumable in the medical industry and respirators had not changed much since WWII.  </p><p>Something had to be done and Gills Labs was born with the intention to develop advanced masks and respirators for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Since then we have made significant innovations in the air PPE domain. These are some of our previous innovation milestones:</p><p>1.

Surgical masks were only a cheap consumable in the medical industry and respirators had not changed much since WWII.  Something had to be done and Gills Labs was born with the intention to develop advanced masks and respirators for the 21st century. Since then we have made significant innovations in the air PPE domain. These are some of our previous innovation milestones:1. Launched the first compact respirator with a medical grade silicone perimeter2. Implemented Reverse Ambient Air Sourcing (RAS) tech3. Introduced the world’s first flexible cartridges4. Introduced the first mask and cartridge based hybrid5. Experimental algae based air purifiers 6. Retrofitted air purification devices  Meet the Founders Campaign Team",36.0,0,"1 Campaign

Thanks to our world-class wetsuit expertise, we have crafted a product of the finest quality with an amazing design, and have produced it with the best low-polluting materials. We are delighted to say that TURTL PROJECT produces the most versatile wetsuit you will ever find at an accessible price.

 


 
Galapagos Wetsuit has been designed and tested for, but is not exclusive to, high-performance Surfing, Kitesurfing, Sailing, Windsurfing, Paddle Surfing, and Wakeboarding.
 

 Wetsuit ranges reinvented. Why having a shorty wetsuit, a long-arm springsuit, a long john, a 5/4/3mm and a 3/2mm wetsuit if you can have a fullsuit for all year long.   Unlike traditional wetsuits, our eco-friendly alternative avoids harmful petroleum-made neoprene as well as it reduces significantly the carbon footprint in the production process.   Amid a monopolized wetsuit market by large brand names, high margins at quality's cost, and no environmental commitment, Turtl Project's effort is to deliver high-quality products with the lowest possible CO2 emissions at reasonable prices.                                    Within a 90% monopolized wetsuit industry, with full control over pricing, high margins at quality's cost, and taking advantage of sustainability to increase prices, Turtl Project wants to offer better-quality and sustainable-only products at a honest accessible price.     We have successfully crafted a watersports’ wide-ranging wetsuit and appropriately tested it to fulfill all needs of current water men & women:  Thanks to our successful configuration, based on the right blend of fabrics and the perfect equilibrium of thicknesses, we have been able to create the most versatile Wetsuit. This way you can avoid having a wetsuit for each season without compromising any feature.  There is not a 4/3mm Wetsuit standard in the market, with diverse and inefficient distributions of thicknesses which limits its target weather conditions ranges.Our formula is simple: full 4mm (+ thermal lining) torso and 3mm limbs of the best and stretchier limestone neoprene which allows us to encompass the widest range of conditions.    To efficiently reduce our production carbon footprint, we decided to launch a crowdfunding campaign as this is a more sustainable approach, optimally producing according to actual demand, and hence, avoiding overproduction.    We selected suppliers that have been Bluesign certified and/or comply with the Standard 100 OEKO-TEX label, which makes our world-class wetsuits respectful for the environment. They have successfully undergone harmful chemicals laboratory tests, besides they comply with ethical and child-labor-free production procedures, not to mention the high quality of the fabrics which makes it a wetsuit of superior durability.  Our premium wetsuits are exclusively produced in a greater sustainable alternative neoprene which not only avoids harmful refined petroleum in the production process but also gives revolutionary flexibility, lighter overall weight, and incomparable heat insulation.      Turtl Project cares about our endangered marine ecosystems, and as you may guess, we care about Sea Turtles. In order to better validate our commitment with our Oceans, we will be giving a % of all pledges to the conservation of Sea Turtles through CRAM: a Foundation for Conservation and Restoration of Marine Species.    We have also created an essential and innovative travel bag to easily bring your fresh Galapagos Wetsuit back home after your session without pouring a single drop of salty water in your backpack. Introducing our brand-new water-resistant bag to pack your wet wetsuit. No more travel hassle assured!             Through this campaign, all our backers will exclusively receive a Mesh Bag made of GOTS Organic Cotton. Get it with an Early Bird discount for a limited time only. Get your Galapagos Wetsuit before anyone else, and at the lowest price.   As part of our commitment to climate positivity, all shipping will be sent by carbon neutral options when available, or by postal services, which use existing routes (as opposed to express shippers) and are the most environmentally friendly way to get a package to your door.  All Shipping fees will be collected separately in the post-purchase survey.  To all Backers: We will ship your Galapagos wetsuit worldwide via trackable post. Please note that no duties & taxes policy only applies to the EU in all packs and US/Australia/New Zealand in some pledges. Other region backers may be charged import duties upon arrival, dependent on your country's import policies.  *Shipping charges above are estimates, final shipping charges will appear on the post-campaign survey and may vary slightly from these estimates. Disclaimer: in case unexpected duties arises, the client will be fully responsible. Check our FAQ to learn more about our shipping rates.   On average, 26% of a garment’s environmental impact happens after-purchase, and has a lot to do with how we take care of our clothes as well as the resources used for washing them.  Here you have our reccons to look after your wetsuit and make it last!  Once your wetsuit is done, don’t get rid of it.

<p><i><strong>For Doctor Staci, seeing plastic flossers wash ashore hit too close to home.</strong></i></p>
<p>The idea for Happi Floss came to Doctor Staci as she witnessed a shocking amount of trash washing ashore while walking a beach in Hawaii. It’s an all too common experience many of us share - escaping into nature only to discover it’s been overrun with plastic waste. For Doctor Staci, seeing plastic flossers wash ashore hit too close to home. As a pediatric dentist, she regularly heard from parents that although they loved the convenience of plastic floss picks for their children, they often would skip flossing altogether due to the guilt they felt using single-use plastic.</p>
<p>After years of testing materials and manufacturing techniques, Happi Floss was born. Intelligently designed to keep their shape in your mouth, yet compost quickly, Happi Floss is composed of layers of compressed, post-consumer recycled paper and biofilm, a plant-based, non petroleum material. When placed in the compost, our layered design allows moisture and microbes to permeate our flossers, quickly breaking them down and turning them back into usable organic matter.</p>
<p>With design complete and thousands of flossers created, the Happi Floss story is really just beginning. Launching Spring 2021, Happi Floss now turns to increasing manufacturing capabilities in order to rid the world of single-use plastic flossers. Consumers and investors are encouraged to support the Happi Floss Kickstarter or to reach out for early investment opportunities.</p>

It’s an all too common experience many of us share - escaping into nature only to discover it’s been overrun with plastic waste. For Doctor Staci, seeing plastic flossers wash ashore hit too close to home. As a pediatric dentist, she regularly heard from parents that although they loved the convenience of plastic floss picks for their children, they often would skip flossing altogether due to the guilt they felt using single-use plastic.
After years of testing materials and manufacturing techniques, Happi Floss was born. Intelligently designed to keep their shape in your mouth, yet compost quickly, Happi Floss is composed of layers of compressed, post-consumer recycled paper and biofilm, a plant-based, non petroleum material. When placed in the compost, our layered design allows moisture and microbes to permeate our flossers, quickly breaking them down and turning them back into usable organic matter.
With design complete and thousands of flossers created, the Happi Floss story is really just beginning. Launching Spring 2021, Happi Floss now turns to increasing manufacturing capabilities in order to rid the world of single-use plastic flossers. Consumers and investors are encouraged to support the Happi Floss Kickstarter or to reach out for early investment opportunities.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>I started developing the mask in October 2019 when I visited my family back home in India. This was at a time when air pollution is at it's worst in the country. It directly impacted my family and I, as we couldn't go out for a walk or run without wearing a restrictive and uncomfortable mask to protect ourselves. I realized that there is a need for a better solution and started developing a breathable and comfortable mask to combat this pollution problem. </p>
<p>With the BreezeBubble mask we are one step closer to providing quality breathing to everyone across the world for a healthy active and happy life. We will continue to iterate and make this mask lighter, more comfortable and high tech and through your support reach millions of people across the globe who will benefit from this solution. </p>
<p>Just a few months back we were brainstorming new ideas for this product and prototyping a new and creative solution for a comfortable mask while studying at University of Michigan.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607028629/co7ejanzlas8hxmoq6u9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After graduating in May, we officially incorporated the company and started working on this startup full time. After a series of prototyping, we released our early adopter SmoothEdge mask. Our early customers bought and tested this mask for $29.99. Along with good reviews some of the feedback we received was that: the mask feels too tight for few users, the ear loops are uncomfortable, the mask feels small for some users, some users would like to have a more aesthetically pleasing mask.<br/> </p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<p>Given this feedback, we decided to develop VERSION 2 the ""Breezebubble UltraProtect mask"" with various product iterations. Through Indiegogo we will ramp up production for this NEW mask and it will retail for $45.00. The changes in this mask are:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Higher Comfort due to new and improved softer and longer ear loops</strong>
</li>
<li><strong> New ear loop adjusters that are tighter and don’t come off easily </strong></li>
<li><strong> Higher Protection (Filters BFE95 certified. N95 Certification in process) </strong></li>
<li><strong> Slightly wider mask design with a softer silicone material to allow a one size fits all for adults</strong></li>
<li>
<strong> Possibility of colorful ear loops, different color mask and designer detachable cloth mask skins (stretch goal if we cross our funding goal amounts)</strong><br/> </li>
</ul>
<p>Through the support of the Indiegogo community of backers, we will be able to bring this new better, smarter, more comfortable BreezeBubble mask to life!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Our Stretch Goals </h2>
<p>Along with some of the changes mentioned above, we want to push ourselves to develop some more awesome new features for our early backers.</p>

<p>If we reach $100k+ we plan to launch new colors that we will decide based on a vote by you! (Choice of Purple / Black / Red / Yellow / Blue / Green )</p>

<p>Through your support of backing and sharing our campaign we will be developing an additional detachable micro-fan cooling device that will be added on to the mask for more ease of breath-ability.

<p>Finally, we plan to provide different mask sizes post the Indiegogo campaign. This will be around March 2021 depending on the demand our production capabilities. We will provide this for 20% off for all our Indiegogo backers and support community.</p>

<p>Summertime is great for outdoor activities and enjoying the sun but being overheated and feeling muggy and sweaty is no fun. Extreme heat conditions can tire you out and can even be dangerous to your health.

<p>In this demonstration, THEKU was placed in a room with a temperature of 24.7° Celsius (76° Fahrenheit). After activation, the temp of THEKU quickly dropped to a comfortable 11° Celsius (51° Fahrenheit). (The TEC components on both sides will be covered with premium aluminum covers in the production unit for even temperature distribution. In this video, the aluminum cover had been removed for demonstration purposes.)<br/> </p>

<ul><li><strong><span>So How Does THEKU Work?</span></strong></li></ul>
<p>According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, “The areas that are most effective in cooling core temperature are the groin, axillae, neck, and torso.” THEKU’s magic works by placing a cooling chip on the neck that cools down the large blood vessels. This cooler blood travels throughout the circulation system to help cool the entire body. <br/> </p>

Extreme heat conditions can tire you out and can even be dangerous to your health. According to the University of Michigan, conditions such as heatstroke can result in “Very high body temperatures may damage the brain or other vital organs.” 
 
Even indoors, people have different temperature sensitivities and what may be a comfortable room temp for one person may be much too hot for another. 
 
Wouldn’t it be great if you had your own personal air-conditioner that you could carry with you anywhere? How enjoyable would it be to remain cool, calm, and comfortable at your preferred temperature anytime & anywhere?
 
 
Now you can with THEKU Neck-Cooler – World’s smallest and lightest Thermoelectric personal cooling device. A go-anywhere personal AC that you wear comfortably on your neck to provide instant cooling to achieve your perfect body temperature for productivity, performance, and comfort. 
 
 
Forget about mini-fan coolers that only deliver a tiny breeze or putting up with a large and noisy desk fan that just blows hot air around. 
 
THEKU takes personal cooling to a whole new level of technology. Its innovative proprietary low-wattage TEC (Thermoelectric) cooling technique effectively maintains the perfect body temperature for you. By providing cooling at the neck, THEKU helps to cool down the entire body. Beat the summer heat by lowering temperature 5-13℃ (9°-23.4°F) to feel better, perform better, and get more work done.  
 
 
 
 
No more sweat stains or unpleasant odors. THEKU changes your comfort level, not just your body temperature. Eliminate mugginess and hot flashes in seconds with THEKU’s Thermal Relief tech and control your body’s temperature and all-day freshness wherever you are.  
 
Remember the feeling of downing a cold drink after a summer day workout? If so, you get the taste of THEKU’s magic. 

THEKU is your gateway to calmness. By balancing your temperature, THEKU gives you a better mood, a sharper mind, and a peaceful heart. It helps you concentrate and improves overall wellness. 
 
Once your temperature cools to your preference, you will instantly feel much better, physically, and mentally. 
 
 

Your Best Outdoor Activities Companion 
It’s never too early to get prepared. The hot 2021 summer will be here before you know it. This year, get out there and enjoy your life with THEKU. Its unibody waterproof design is light, comfortable and IPX7 certified for water and sweat resistance. THEKU is your best companion for outdoor sports like jogging, golfing, fishing, climbing, cycling, motorcycling, and hiking.  
 
 Comes In Handy For Every Occasion  
Hands-free and noiseless, THEKU works in all conditions to bring you coolness for better performance during any workout and helps keep you productive during office work, daily commute, working around the house, or while driving.  
 
 
 
THEKU is the result of years of research and development. Our team’s only goal is to offer you the world’s smallest and lightest TEC wearable air conditioner. 
 
Made of a titanium memory alloy, THEKU weighs only 80g and is shaped ergonomically to comfortably fit and adapt to all body sizes. 
 
 

What Is Super TEC Cooling Technology? 
Unlike a fan that simply blows air that only cools down the skin’s surface, THEKU provides instant thermal relief for your whole body. It is equipped with a proprietary mini-type thermoelectric cooling system with the lowest 0.9w power dissipation to provide more than 2hrs of battery life per charge.   
 

 THEKU Cooling Capabilities DEMO  
In this demonstration, THEKU was placed in a room with a temperature of 24.7° Celsius (76° Fahrenheit). After activation, the temp of THEKU quickly dropped to a comfortable 11° Celsius (51° Fahrenheit). (The TEC components on both sides will be covered with premium aluminum covers in the production unit for even temperature distribution. In this video, the aluminum cover had been removed for demonstration purposes.) 

 
So How Does THEKU Work?
According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, “The areas that are most effective in cooling core temperature are the groin, axillae, neck, and torso.” THEKU’s magic works by placing a cooling chip on the neck that cools down the large blood vessels. This cooler blood travels throughout the circulation system to help cool the entire body.  

 
 
 
Safety Is Our No.1 Priority
To provide our users with the best and safest experience, THEKU is designed with an accurate temperature control system. The smart chip & algorithm captures the outside temperature and locks down the cooling capability to reduce the temperature by 5-13℃ (9°-23.4°F) relative to the outside air. It provides soothing comfort no matter what the weather conditions are.

Now she has a joyful daughter (Julia - 1,5) who has brought creative energy into her life, inspiring her to share it with the world.Laryssa was introduced to Yoga and Ayurveda for the first time during a dark time in Brazil. Yoga helped her thrive and gave her a different perspective on life that she had never experienced before. As a result, she came to Australia, particularly Byron Bay, to dive deeply into herself. She then enrolled in an Ayurveda course, which transformed and saved her. Laryssa has earned an advanced diploma in Ayurveda after 4,5 years of dedicated study and yet having so much to learn, but in love with this science, now wishes to spread it with the world.Ayurveda has shaped our lives. Thanks to it, we can now identify our bodies’ strengths and weaknesses and use this knowledge for our well-being.The desire to facilitate the Ayurvedic Daily Routine for the collective emerged as we realised many people want and believe in the power of Ayurveda but find it difficult to follow a routine of habits considered holistic. Based on classic books and studies, together we have dreamed and created “My Ayurvedic Diary”, aiming to help people learn and experience Ayurveda, the most ancient form of healing, in its authentic form through the year. Your support is the key to sharing this dream with the world. Our goal is to print this planner and spread this knowledge that empowers, heals, and enlightens. WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET
So far, the project has been entirely self-funded, and the design is already concluded. Using only family support and weekly income from our ordinary jobs, we've hired a designer, artist, translator, web designer, astrologer, and editor to make it happen. Despite working several jobs and raising a family, we are incredibly proud of what we have achieved.

Imagine if you could be fully <b>aware </b>that you are dreaming without you actually waking up. Such a state of consciousness is possible and it is called “lucid dreaming”.</p>
<p>Once you are lucid in a dream, you can take control of your dream actions and consciously reshape the dream to fulfill any fantasy and experience anything you can imagine! To control your dream, however, you must first become <b>aware</b> that you are dreaming. iBand+ helps you do that!</p>

<p>Dreams occur when you are in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) phase of your sleep. During REM phase, the body is largely disconnected from the brain, effectively leaving the muscles incapable of movement -- the reason we don’t act out our dreams. <b>iBand+ accurately senses this dream phase by monitoring variations in your brain waves and the body movements</b>.</p>

<p>Once in lucid dream, you enter a virtual world where <b>everything you see, hear, touch, taste and smell is as authentic as reality</b>!</p>
<p>Lucid dreaming has been researched scientifically. Many psychologists and researchers have recognized that lucid dreams can help with artistic creativity, problem solving, improving sports and language skills, and can even help people prone to nightmares to get their fears under control.</p>

Based on the information gathered from your previous sleep cycles, iBand+ app recommends the audio-visual techniques that can work best for you and helps you choose from the pre-loaded audios. In the future, you can also choose from your own music and audiobook library.







Dreams are the best and most authentic VR experience; a world with no rules and consequences. Imagine if you could be fully aware that you are dreaming without you actually waking up. Such a state of consciousness is possible and it is called “lucid dreaming”.
Once you are lucid in a dream, you can take control of your dream actions and consciously reshape the dream to fulfill any fantasy and experience anything you can imagine! To control your dream, however, you must first become aware that you are dreaming. iBand+ helps you do that!

Dreams occur when you are in the Rapid Eye Movement (REM) phase of your sleep. During REM phase, the body is largely disconnected from the brain, effectively leaving the muscles incapable of movement -- the reason we don’t act out our dreams. iBand+ accurately senses this dream phase by monitoring variations in your brain waves and the body movements.

Once iBand+ senses this dream phase, it plays audio-visual cues. These subtle external stimuli of light patterns via the LEDs on headband and sound from the pillow speakers appear as anomalies in your dream making you aware that you are dreaming without waking you up.

Once in lucid dream, you enter a virtual world where everything you see, hear, touch, taste and smell is as authentic as reality!
Lucid dreaming has been researched scientifically. Many psychologists and researchers have recognized that lucid dreams can help with artistic creativity, problem solving, improving sports and language skills, and can even help people prone to nightmares to get their fears under control.

A productive day starts with a great night’s sleep. Soothing music is one of the oldest techniques used for meditation and relaxation. Music can help the onset of sleep, improve sleep quality and sleep duration thus leading to a greater sleep satisfaction.

iBand+ helps you sleep easily in a natural way with sounds and music that calm your mind and trigger sleep. It tracks your sleep cycle, body movement, and intelligently adjusts the music and the volume as you fall asleep. Once asleep, iBand+ turns off the music. It then gently introduces white noise that masks distractions and ensures a sound sleep.

Sleep is very important to restore energy reserves and strengthen the immune system. Even minimal sleep loss affects mood, productivity, ability to handle stress and even body weight!

iBand+ tracks your sleep by monitoring brain waves, indicates sleep quality and gives feedback on improvement.


iBand+ has the most advanced smart alarm feature that wakes you up gradually with simulated natural sunlight and sounds at the most optimum period of sleep cycle so that you wake up refreshed every time!

EEG brain sensing technology is the core of iBand+ functionality.

The brain uses electrical pulses to transmit messages. iBand+ is the EEG headband that reads and records activity in the brain through its dry electrodes. ‘Brain waves’ are the graphs plotted from these readings.
EEG technology has been used extensively in the medical field, but recent advances in nanotechnology and increasing computational power has made it possible to shrink the EEG electronic circuits and embed them in wearables for everyday applications.
iBand+ headband communicates with iBand+ app on your iOS and Android smartphones via Bluetooth.

Smart home integration


Imagine using your brain waves to control numerous smart devices in your home to simplify your daily life. For example, when you fall asleep iBand+ could make sure that lights are off, doors locked, security alarm activated and thermostat adjusted to maintain a comfortable bedroom temperature!
Developers can publish their apps on our website that would enable everyone to use iBand+ in many other ways.




Meditation is an excellent form of mind training that relieves stress, improves concentration and mindfulness, thus improving your quality of life.
iBand+ sleep meditation feature with brainwave entrainment audio-visual techniques is also an excellent way of preparing yourself for lucid dreaming!
5 to 10 minutes of iBand+ sleep meditation technique before going to sleep is what it will take to relax yourself, define the dream cues, set the dream intention and increase self-awareness in your dreams - crucial preparation tactics to become and stay lucid in your dreams.
iBand+ headband with its EEG brain-sensing will track your state of mind during sleep meditation which you can easily check via iBand+ app. You can even compare your daily meditation performance through this app. The app will also provide tips and suggestions to improve your sleep meditation!

Here's how the technology works, in a nutshell. </p><p>The VisionCheck 2 is based on an MIT patented technology licensed exclusively to EyeQue. This technology has been extensively tested in previous generations of our products and uses a variant of the inverse Shack-Hartmann optical method.</p><p>The original Shack-Hartmann method is used in an optical device called ""autorefractor"" and trusted by eye doctors around the world. The autorefractor, short for ""automated refractometer, is used to give a quick estimation of vision correction. You may recognize it by its iconic ""hot air balloon"" or ""barn house"" image. Many of the optical principles and components used in the autorefractor are also used in the creation of the VisionCheck 2.</p><p>The device projects two beams of light that comes from the smartphone display into your eyes and onto your retina. Using an interactive interface, the user overlaps the two lines to form what looks like one yellow line.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612481982/bmznslfjfnrbxniabszz.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Based on the amount of pixel movement made to fully overlap the two lines into one yellow line, EyeQue calculates the user's refractive error. Proprietary algorithms then process results once a full test is completed. After three or more consistent tests are taken, EyeGlass Numbers® are calculated and presented in the same format as a traditional prescription with the spherical, cylindrical, and axis powers needed to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612474746/axaiwk0flyohnprib6yx.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Users have performed approximately 150,000 tests using this proprietary technology.

Nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism occur when the eye lens and eye distance are “out of sync"". Normal distance vision is the result of the light entering the eye and focusing exactly on the retina, where the brain interprets sharp images. Common deviations from normal vision include nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Nearsightedness, or myopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light before your retina. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light past your retina, both causing the brain to interpret ""blurry"" images. Almost 50% of the human population has some degree of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism.

Measurements are made at increments of 45 degrees and with these measurements, the astigmatism is computed.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612479227/zbfgzbijxlthwaotqdn0.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Yes, that’s a lot of measurements, but the device is making measurements of tiny differences that reflect the shape of the eye lens and cornea. About 1 diopter of astigmatism, a typical value, implies that the non-spherical component of the eye is about 0.25 mm. 0.25mm is thinner than your average ball-point pen point.</p><p>All computations are carried out in the EyeQue cloud as it takes a substantial amount of computation that is dependent on many different parameters including the smartphone you are using.

This powerful smartphone attachment uses MIT-patented technology to measure your refractive error and provide EyeGlass Numbers - the lens power needed to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The VisionCheck 2 comes with the PDCheck pupillary distance measurement tool so you can quickly and accurately capture your PD and order glasses with ease.*NEW! Now the VisionCheck 2 can test for reading vision, commonly know as near-vision ADD (NV ADD). This ADD number can be used for reading glasses, bifocals, or progressive lenses.VisionCheck 2 is the world’s only do-it-yourself smartphone-powered refractive error test. Some claim to have online or app-based refraction tests, but they are merely prescription verification services based on visual acuity estimates. EyeQue users are actually performing a self-refraction test while proprietary algorithms process, personalize, and store results. Leveraging the power and ubiquity of smartphones, the mobility of VisionCheck 2 brings accurate vision correction to billions of people, many of whom lack access to traditional vision care. Sound too good to be true? Here's how to use it:1. Download the iOS or Android app and sign up for an account.2. Slip the VisionCheck 2 device onto your smartphone and follow simple on-screen instructions to start a test.3. Look into the soft eyecup. Look for the red and green lines. Use the buttons on the device to move them and overlap into one solid yellow line. 4. Once you are satisfied that the lines are fully overlapped, click on the ""enter"" button and gently rotate the thumb wheel to the next position. Overlap the lines again and repeat. The test consists of 8 measurements per eye.5. See your results- EyeQue EyeGlass Numbers® (EGNs). Here's an example of what your EyeQue EyeGlass Numbers® (EGNs) will look like:We are delighted to show you a proof of concept prototype video of the VisionCheck 2:Once you have your EyeGlass Numbers, the next step is to measure your pupillary distance using EyeQue’s PDCheck.PDCheckVisionCheck 2 includes another product called PDCheck. An accurate measurement of pupillary distance (PD) is necessary to order eyeglasses. If the measured PD is wrong, you will find the glasses uncomfortable and it will make you feel dizzy, it can sometimes even lead to headaches. Our patented PDCheck technology uses the smartphone camera to take a “selfie” and extracts the PD to an accuracy of +/- 1 mm.How do you use PDCheck?1. Download the iOS or Android app and sign up for an account then start a new test. Next, you should put on the PDCheck frames.2. Center your face inside the oval and take a picture. 3. Adjust the markers to the center of your pupils and T marks (if needed) to get the most accurate PD. Receive your pupillary distance measurement instantly! Once you have your EyeGlass Numbers and your pupillary distance, you can get Try-On Glasses or get new glasses online using your EGNs!Our Try-On Glasses are custom made in California. At only $19 (shipping included), they are a low-cost, super-fast way to experience how well your EGNs and PD will work for you.SubscriptionEyeQue smartphone-vision tests require an annual membership subscription.

Stay tuned for more updates. Yes, yes it does! Here's how the technology works, in a nutshell. The VisionCheck 2 is based on an MIT patented technology licensed exclusively to EyeQue. This technology has been extensively tested in previous generations of our products and uses a variant of the inverse Shack-Hartmann optical method.The original Shack-Hartmann method is used in an optical device called ""autorefractor"" and trusted by eye doctors around the world. The autorefractor, short for ""automated refractometer, is used to give a quick estimation of vision correction. You may recognize it by its iconic ""hot air balloon"" or ""barn house"" image. Many of the optical principles and components used in the autorefractor are also used in the creation of the VisionCheck 2.The device projects two beams of light that comes from the smartphone display into your eyes and onto your retina. Using an interactive interface, the user overlaps the two lines to form what looks like one yellow line.Based on the amount of pixel movement made to fully overlap the two lines into one yellow line, EyeQue calculates the user's refractive error. Proprietary algorithms then process results once a full test is completed. After three or more consistent tests are taken, EyeGlass Numbers® are calculated and presented in the same format as a traditional prescription with the spherical, cylindrical, and axis powers needed to correct nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Users have performed approximately 150,000 tests using this proprietary technology. Hundreds of testimonials and thousands of surveys from VisionCheck customers helped inform product updates to VisionCheck 2. We set out to create a refraction device that's easier to use, with more accurate results, and better optics.Based on the feedback of our members,  we came up with a brand new form factor, app design, and test screens – nearly every aspect of the user experience has been reimagined.We're proud to announce that the VisionCheck 2 was named a CES® 2021 Innovation Awards Honoree in two categories– Health & Wellness, and Mobile Devices & Accessories
A more interesting test taking experience with new backgrounds: A new background channel features a variety of customizable animated images that help you get more accurate results. Larger, brighter, easier-to-see lines: A better optical system allows the display lines to appear larger and crisper than the lines in the previous device, making them easier to see, therefore improving test efficiency and accuracy. 
Easier to attach clip system: A convenient clip that's compatible with most phone cases allows the VisionCheck 2 to easily attach to any phone without interfering with any buttons or Popsockets.
Easy to rotate thumb wheel design: A new, purely mechanical, easy-to-rotate thumb wheel design allows you to proceed to the next test without having to take your eyes off the device, so you can maintain focus and complete the test faster. Plus, testing has been reduced from 9 meridians down to 8 meridians, making for a faster testing process.
Upgraded eye cup design: A redesigned, ergonomic eye cup helps filter more light for an easier test taking experience. 
Tactile buttons: Redesigned test buttons on the VisionCheck 2 improve the ergonomics of the test taking experience. The new buttons also eliminate the need to connect your device to your phone via Bluetooth - this also eliminates the need for batteries, so you don't need to charge the VisionCheck 2.Brand new app: A reimagined app design maximizes usability. The new app includes educational elements and makes it easier to reach support. The MIT-patented technology powering the VisionCheck 2 has been extensively tested with over 150,000 tests over the past 3 years and has been optimized to give excellent refraction values for ordering eyeglasses.Moreover, at-home vision test results can be more accurate than a single point-in-time refraction test. Since your vision fluctuates throughout the day, taking multiple tests at different times of the day gives a better average refraction than a one-time refraction test during an office visit. Especially if someone is having a bad day!Real VisionCheck and Try-On Glasses users share their stories. Dan:Michael: EyeQue has a family of vision testing products that work together to equip you with everything you need to order eyeglasses.  We cannot explain the science without explaining the human eye first. Nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism occur when the eye lens and eye distance are “out of sync"". Normal distance vision is the result of the light entering the eye and focusing exactly on the retina, where the brain interprets sharp images. Common deviations from normal vision include nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Nearsightedness, or myopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light before your retina. Farsightedness, or hyperopia, occurs when the lens focuses the light past your retina, both causing the brain to interpret ""blurry"" images. Almost 50% of the human population has some degree of nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. These conditions are also known as ""refractive errors"".While it is easy to understand how EyeQue can measure the overall optical power for nearsightedness and farsightedness, VisionCheck 2 also gets an accurate measurement of astigmatism by sampling over different angles. To measure astigmatism, a complete set of power measurements is comprised of 8 measurements for your right eye and 8 measurements for your left eye. Measurements are made at increments of 45 degrees and with these measurements, the astigmatism is computed.Yes, that’s a lot of measurements, but the device is making measurements of tiny differences that reflect the shape of the eye lens and cornea. About 1 diopter of astigmatism, a typical value, implies that the non-spherical component of the eye is about 0.25 mm. 0.25mm is thinner than your average ball-point pen point.All computations are carried out in the EyeQue cloud as it takes a substantial amount of computation that is dependent on many different parameters including the smartphone you are using. As you take more tests, the results are aggregated together through averaging and removing bad data points. Each test is scored based on the goodness of the computed fit to the measurements. An example of test results is shown below.Along with your test results, we also provide you with a measure of the consistency. The plot on the right also shows how other users have performed as shown by the relative size of the blue dots; most but not all users fall into the ""good"" category.

They melt muscle tension so you can relax and sleep better. Elo aims to reverse the bodily responses associated with stress, slowing breath and increasing the parasympathetic activity that makes you feel calm and rested. Target muscle groups on your own or unlock some bonding time with a partner. Giving the perfect massage is effortless with Elo.
 
Hot stone is the premier treatment in spas and can be expensive, especially for frequent visits. Elo is a one time cost, and can be used any time you want. Skip the spa and get the life changing treatment of hot stones in the comfort of your own home.
 
Used for over 2000 years to melt muscle tension and put you into a meditative state. Elo has reinvented this ancient practice, using hand-shaped volcanic stones that preserve the traditions that make it so powerful. The stones you’ll hold in your hand each time you use Elo started their journey possibly thousands of years ago as hot, molten rock from deep inside the earth that once reached over 2000 F before settling down, untouched for generations.Basalt volcanic stone is what the ancients used and is still preferred by professionals around the world. It has amazing heat retention properties and allows heat to be given off slowly and sustainably.
 
We've thought it all through. Elo makes it possible for you get the benefits of Hot Stones entirely on your own. Easily target muscle groups with the help of the included stone placement mat and position guide. Lying overtop of Elo stones just before bed each night can help induce a sense of total calm from which to drift gently off to sleep.
 
Elo is an immersive experience for your senses, incorporating ambient light and aromatherapy for optimal relaxation. Sleep is in Elo's DNA, combining the most calming sensory experiences into a minimalist device that deserves a spot on your nightstand. 
  7 heavy volcanic Elo Stones heat up fast to 3 temperature levels and slowly release captivating warmth to soothe and calm your body and mind. 
 
 
 
 Diffuse calming essential oil blends to trigger your mind to change states from active to passive. 
 
 High-output LED light rings produce calming visual effects and mimic dusk skies. Set your mood with the app, launching 2021.
 
 
  Hot stones have been used in different cultures around the world for thousands of years. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 We spent 3 years working alongside professional therapists to develop Elo, starting with the traditional volcanic stones of this ancient practice and integrating the capabilities, speed, intelligent sensors, and smartphone connectivity we expect, in a modern device.",65.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>How does the Hela Bio Smart Watch help me to enjoy the benefits of exercise?</strong></p>
<p>For a Type 1 diabetic, exercise can be a delicate balancing act of eating enough, taking enough insulin, and managing the increased effectiveness of insulin while exercising.</p>
<p>By measuring your sugar levels when you work up a sweat you are able to always know if it’s safe to keep going. Giving up too soon can mean you miss out on the benefits of exercise as a whole.</p>
<p>Exercising too long can cause hypoglycemia in the middle of a sports event or at the gym. Many diabetics will preload with carbs to offset the lows and the result can be unwanted high sugar levels. The Hela Bio SmartWatch makes getting fit much easier for Type 1 Diabetics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does the Hela Bio Smart Watch read glucose from sweat?</strong></p>
<p>With just one drop of sweat, you can test your sweat sugar, then view your Blood Glucose reading in the Hela Smartphone app.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I have Type 2 Diabetes, can it work for me?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, in fact, the Hela Bio Smart Watch is ideal for anyone looking for information on their body throughout the day. We have chosen to focus on the benefits to those with Type 1 Diabetes because having a low during exercise is something many Type 1s struggle with. However, Type 2s and everyone else, measuring glucose levels, blood pressure trends, heart rate, and more, are useful indicators that can improve your everyday life. The watch has so many features, it’s hard to list them all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why has no one else done this before?</strong></p>
<p>The Hela Bio Smart Watch uses innovative and internationally patented technology. Other glucose metering systems rely on blood or interstitial fluid (under the skin) to provide glucose readings. These methods have their benefits, but they present issues when exercising as they require you to interrupt your workout to conduct a test. When playing a sport, you need to keep your focus on the game. When running, it can take a while to get into 'the flow', and stopping to test can make it harder to push yourself. The Hela Bio Smart Watch gives you the freedom to know your levels when active so that you can keep going.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will I get my watch?</strong></p>
<p>The Hela Bio Smart Watch is in full production, and delivery is guaranteed. If you back the project to receive a watch, you will receive a watch, simple as that. We use the same logistics platform as Apple.</p>

Your enthusiasm and support are the motivation that pushes us forward and makes our products better every day!
We have now started the trial-production in order to figure out and help prevent potential risks that might affect mass-production later on. For more information, please check our updates.56% of people with diabetes today would test themselves 8-10 times per day with a traditional finger-pricking kit. That means pricking your finger 8-10 times a day. Painful, right? If testing was painless and convenient, wouldn’t it be amazing? Luckily, now we have Hela!You can check out the video for how accurate the Hela watch works. We made a comparison with the traditional monitor that is frequently used on normal days.  Your blood sugar level equals your glucose(mMOL/L) divided by 1%~2%, and a result between 4.0~6.5 (glucose 60.0~97.5 uMOL/L) is considered healthy. Please keep in mind that blood sugar measurement is most accurate when an empty stomach.
Using Hela to measure your glucose is simple, quick, and 100% completely pain-free. Probably the most convenient solution to your diabetes problems, in a simple wearable device on your wrist that accurately tests your blood sugar level with just a drop of sweat (about 1 μL).

The Hela Bio Smart Watch uses its unique patented technology to read your blood sugar levels within three seconds. By analyzing your sweat, it gives you an accurate result on your glucose and active acid levels.

No pain, no prick. Just apply a drop of sweat on the sensor as you continue on whatever exercise you’re doing, and see your result on the display. A green circle means you are in good condition. A red circle will show when your blood sugar is too high. Compare to traditional glucose test kits, Hela has advantages, including its size, portability, convenience, data volume, and monitoring frequency than traditional devices simply cannot compete with.
Most importantly, it’s painless, wearable and cost-efficient. We know most people with diabetes spend nearly $1000 annually on test strips for blood glucose testing⎯With Hela, you’ll only need to spend half as much.

<br/><strong>Why Proper Technique?</strong>
</h3><p>Quite simply, because it's good for you! Foot function and athletic performance capabilities have a lot in common. Both are affected by how we regularly use our bodies.</p><p>Proper Technique is used to describe the execution of physical activity that promotes healthy robust function with a reduced risk of injury. Poor Technique refers to the execution of physical activity that has a negative effect on your body and increases risk of injury. Footwear that supports, cushions, and/or restricts the foot’s natural dynamic movement creates a poor technique environment.</p><p>There are 100,000 sensory receptors in the soles of your feet that provide the critical information required by the brain to activate optimal muscle function throughout the feet, legs, hips, and back.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.biopods.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/healthystim.gif"" src=""""/></p><p><br/>BioPods’ Stimsole technologies provide this critical information and encourage optimal movement with every step you take, ensuring “Proper Technique” function during all of your activities. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623899605/zspetmpinmctvfrilgcj.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Our Urban Flex model in Black on White. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623812933/wbnfysgaujcwq57q6k0u.png"" src=""""/></p><ul>

Modern science has identified that prolonged artificial support or cushioning of a body part results in progressive functional atrophy. It becomes weaker, less physically capable, and more prone to injury. In effect, artificial support and cushioning create a Poor Technique environment that results in the imbalanced muscle use, instability, and poor alignment that contribute to shoe-related problems and pain.</p><p>The modern approach to addressing unhealthy function that arises from a Poor Technique environment is to employ Proper Technique exercise to retrain and maintain healthy function. Recent advancements in neurology have crystalized a new scientific understanding of what constitutes healthy Proper Technique foot function.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>BioPods Stimsole Sneakers = Healthy Function</strong></h3><p>BioPods Stimsole Sneaker designs incorporate this latest science. Biopods Sneakers are the world’s first shoes that create a healthy Proper Technique environment for your feet.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What Needs To Happen For Healthy Function?</strong></h3><p>Recent scientific advancements emphasize that the quality of sensory information transmitted from the soles of the feet to the brain is vital for healthy function in the feet, legs, hips, and back.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/369366064?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div>
<strong>This healthy function occurs naturally in those who regularly walk or run barefoot on natural terrain. </strong>With each step, the soles of their feet receive a subtly different sensory experience during ground contact. In response, the brain initiates protective muscle activations before, and in anticipation of, each new step’s “unknown” ground contact.</div><p>These protective reflexes are nature’s way of keeping the body safe from harm. They are responsible for optimal alignment and efficient muscle function, including the dynamic rising of the toes and arches, which is critical to stabilizing the foot and ankle.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>Conventional Footwear = Poor Technique</strong></h3><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/369366978?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div><strong>Footwear, supportive orthotics, and cushioning insoles create a Poor Technique environment for your feet by inhibiting healthy function in two ways:</strong></div><p>1. Stimulus to the soles of the feet is muted and unchanging step after step. Therefore, the brain does not receive sufficient information to initiate healthy protective reflex activations in the feet and legs.</p><p>2. Footwear with stiff soles, shallow toe boxes, or restrictive arch areas prevent the dynamic rising of the toes and arches that are critical to the stabilization of the foot and ankle.</p><p>Over time, the Poor Technique environment trains the poor alignment and inefficient muscle function to become the dysfunctional “norm.” As a result, the feet become increasingly weaker and more dependent on the artificial support/cushioning. This leads to footwear-related foot and ankle instability, poor lower limb alignment, and imbalanced muscle use that contributes to a wide range of problems and discomfort.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>BioPods Sneakers = Proper Technique</strong></h3><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/548129235?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div>Grounded in science and proven in practice, BioPods Stimsole Sneakers provide the subtle, varied stimulus to the soles of the feet and encourage the natural dynamic movement required for healthy function.</div><p>This Proper Technique environment helps safely retrain and maintain healthy protective reflex function in your feet, legs, hips, and back, minimizing the risk of injury.

With consistent use, they will help you reach your personal level of optimal function. Like any therapeutic exercise program, this retraining process takes time.</p><p>Other than the few exceptions noted below, everyone, regardless of age and foot-related problem history will benefit from consistent use of BioPods Sneakers.</p><p>In most instances, younger people and those without an extensive history of foot-related problems will respond very quickly, usually within a week or two. If you are older or have a long history of foot-related problems, it can take a month or two to regain your personal level of healthy function.</p><p>Most importantly, every moment you are wearing shoes, they are training neuromuscular function. Therefore, for optimal benefits, BioPods Sneakers should be worn as often as possible. The more you are active and on your feet, the greater their benefits. </p><p><strong>Rehabilitation sticking points</strong></p><p>If you have longstanding foot-related issues or lower limb/hip surgeries, in most instances, you will have developed inelastic scar tissue/fibrosis at one or more locations throughout the feet, legs, hips, and back. Often these fibrotic areas are not symptomatic because they aren’t being challenged by movement. These inelastic areas can become irritated and painful sticking points that impede the body’s adjustment towards healthier function.</p><p>The good news is that these inelastic tissues are easily addressed by a Healthcare Professional using Soft Tissue Mobilization Therapies, such as deep tissue massage, ultrasound, Active Release Technique, and laser. After a few treatments, these tissues will regain their natural elasticity to allow the body’s continued adjustment towards healthy function. In more severe instances, there may be several layers of fibrotic/scar tissue (like layers of an onion), each becoming engaged and presenting symptoms only after an outer layer's inelasticity has been resolved.

We created BioPods® Stimsole® Sneakers because we know footwear can be (and should be) different! Step into science and say goodbye to foot stress and fatigue and hello to exceptional performance and comfort!Our Sneakers are designed to stimulate and retrain healthy function rather than artificially support or cushion, it’s that simple!  BioPods Stimsole Sneakers are the worlds’ first shoes that incorporate modern Proper Technique rehabilitation and sport training principles.                                         The World's First Proper Technique Footwear After 35 years of foot care experience and years of research, our team of athletes and healthcare professionals gained a new scientific understanding of optimal foot function based on modern sports training principles. This new understanding changes how foot-related conditions and athletic performance are viewed and identifies ideal footwear design characteristics.  BioPods Insole and Sneakers feature patent-pending Stimsole technologies that incorporate this new science.We introduced the world to BioPods Stimsole Insoles in 2016 and are now proud to present our revolutionary Stimsole Sneakers.  
Why Proper Technique?
Quite simply, because it's good for you! Foot function and athletic performance capabilities have a lot in common. Both are affected by how we regularly use our bodies.Proper Technique is used to describe the execution of physical activity that promotes healthy robust function with a reduced risk of injury. Poor Technique refers to the execution of physical activity that has a negative effect on your body and increases risk of injury. Footwear that supports, cushions, and/or restricts the foot’s natural dynamic movement creates a poor technique environment.There are 100,000 sensory receptors in the soles of your feet that provide the critical information required by the brain to activate optimal muscle function throughout the feet, legs, hips, and back. BioPods’ Stimsole technologies provide this critical information and encourage optimal movement with every step you take, ensuring “Proper Technique” function during all of your activities. Our Urban Flex model in Black on White.  
People who enjoy or want to enjoy an active lifestyle.
People who are tired of experiencing discomfort and problems related to poor footwear fit and function.
Athletes who want to improve their performance capabilities and reduce risk of injury.

Anyone, from children to seniors who regularly wear shoes. 
  BioPods Stimsole Sneakers create a Proper Technique environment for your feet.Therapeutic and Rehabilitative BioPods Sneakers work like a therapeutic exercise program by providing the Stimulus and the freedom of movement that is required for healthy foot and lower limb function.Wear them consistently for best results.
Designed for Active Lifestyles
We developed BioPods Sneakers for active people and those who want to be! Our goal was to make the healthiest footwear possible, and we believe we have succeeded. Our patent-pending Stimsole outsole design is universally applicable to a wide range of activities.
Revolutionary Fit for Optimal Comfort
                                 Our sneakers perfect fit = optimal comfort.We customize your BioPods Sneakers based on your foot measurements to ensure an optimal fit. BioPods Sneakers are designed to provide a dynamic Proper Technique environment rather than snugly encapsulate your feet. Our Sneakers fit loosely and move in harmony with your natural foot movement, which is the foundation for optimal comfort and healthy function. 
Breathable and Lightweight
                           Don’t work up a sweat when you don’t need to!BioPods' extremely lightweight Sneakers almost feel like you're wearing nothing at all, so your muscles aren’t working harder than they need to. And when you pick up the pace, BioPods Sneakers' breathable uppers help keep the heat down.  
Enhanced Athletic Performance     Run higher, jump faster and exceed your goals with BioPods Stimsole Sneakers.Athletes understand the importance of Proper Technique training. It promotes a balance of strength and flexibility, safely increases functional robustness, and reduces the risk of injury. Now you can get the benefits of Proper Technique exercise in your everyday shoes to better prepare your body for your more rigorous athletic activities. Recommended by Health Care Professionals It’s not surprising that with a 99+% success rate, more and more healthcare professionals are recommending BioPods technologies as a more effective alternative to custom orthotics.   Incorporate patent-pending Stimsole technologies and innovative design  Midsole/Outsole Stimsole Technologies BioPods' patent-pending outsole/midsole and Sneaker upper designs create a Proper Technique environment for your feet by providing healthy Right Stimulus and encouraging the Right Movement. Personalize Your Stimulus Level   Interchangeable Velco® backed discs provide 3 levels of stimulus adjustment under your arches to accommodate your specific needs and provide optimal comfort. Extremely Flexible  BioPods Sneakers’ soft flexible outsoles and 4-way stretch uppers encourage optimal dynamic foot movement for exceptional fit, comfort, and performance. Neutral Heel BioPods' innovative outsole/midsole design provides a neutral heel for a natural gait. The outsole’s heel is 1mm thicker than the forefoot, while the midsole stimulus pins are the same height. This extra 1 mm under the bottom of the midsole pins allows the soft honeycomb treads to compress a bit more at heel strike to provide enhanced initial traction and grip. Exceptional Traction and Anti-Slip Properties  We designed our sneakers with optimal traction, grip, and anti-slip properties in mind. Our proprietary EVA material and innovative honeycomb tread design feature soft elastic-like cells. During weight bearing, the honeycomb treads deform, creating a wide contact patch that enhances traction and grip. And the midsole pin’s TPU material becomes tacky when wet. Our proprietary EVA material is also exceptionally durable and won’t leave marks on your floors. Made With Eco-Friendly Materials   BioPods Stimsole sneakers are good for you and the environment. Our Sneakers’ 4-way stretch knitted uppers and inner linings are made from Ynviron® yarns and Repreve® fabrics, both made from recycled plastic bottles. On average, each pair of sneakers contains materials made from 8 recycled plastic bottles. Do good + feel good = world changer! Water Repellent and Stain Resistant  BioPods Sneakers' are treated with Fluorine-Free NeverWet® DWR, which repels water and resists staining. Our Sneakers keep your feet dry in the rain and dry out quickly after being submerged in water. Feather-lite Averaging just over 1lb, BioPods Sneakers feel like you're wearing nothing at all.  A BioPods Sneaker for Every Occassion Customized Fit For Every Backer BioPods Stimsole Sneakers are designed to comfortably fit all foot types. Whether your feet are wide, narrow, flat, or high arched, our innovative customization process ensures a perfect fit. Based on your foot measurements, for your foot length, we combine one of two outsole widths with uppers made from one of three degrees of 4-way stretch to make your sneakers. This gives you an exceptionally comfortable, loose-fitting sneaker that mirrors your natural foot movement for optimal function.] No need to measure just yet. Once our campaign is complete, we will get your custom shoe size. Step Into ScienceBioPods Stimsole Sneakers are designed to retrain healthy function rather than provide artificial support or cushioning. Foot-related problems and our performance capabilities have a lot in common. Both are the result of how we regularly use our bodies. Healthy activities help our bodies become stronger and more capable, while unhealthy activities weaken our bodies, making them prone to injury. Every moment we spend wearing shoes trains foot and leg function that is either healthy or unhealthy. 
Support & Cushioning = Unhealthy Function Recent research is changing the way foot and leg function is viewed. Modern science has identified that prolonged artificial support or cushioning of a body part results in progressive functional atrophy. It becomes weaker, less physically capable, and more prone to injury. In effect, artificial support and cushioning create a Poor Technique environment that results in the imbalanced muscle use, instability, and poor alignment that contribute to shoe-related problems and pain.The modern approach to addressing unhealthy function that arises from a Poor Technique environment is to employ Proper Technique exercise to retrain and maintain healthy function. Recent advancements in neurology have crystalized a new scientific understanding of what constitutes healthy Proper Technique foot function. BioPods Stimsole Sneakers = Healthy FunctionBioPods Stimsole Sneaker designs incorporate this latest science. Biopods Sneakers are the world’s first shoes that create a healthy Proper Technique environment for your feet. What Needs To Happen For Healthy Function?Recent scientific advancements emphasize that the quality of sensory information transmitted from the soles of the feet to the brain is vital for healthy function in the feet, legs, hips, and back. 
This healthy function occurs naturally in those who regularly walk or run barefoot on natural terrain. With each step, the soles of their feet receive a subtly different sensory experience during ground contact. In response, the brain initiates protective muscle activations before, and in anticipation of, each new step’s “unknown” ground contact.These protective reflexes are nature’s way of keeping the body safe from harm. They are responsible for optimal alignment and efficient muscle function, including the dynamic rising of the toes and arches, which is critical to stabilizing the foot and ankle. Conventional Footwear = Poor Technique Footwear, supportive orthotics, and cushioning insoles create a Poor Technique environment for your feet by inhibiting healthy function in two ways:1. Stimulus to the soles of the feet is muted and unchanging step after step. Therefore, the brain does not receive sufficient information to initiate healthy protective reflex activations in the feet and legs.2. Footwear with stiff soles, shallow toe boxes, or restrictive arch areas prevent the dynamic rising of the toes and arches that are critical to the stabilization of the foot and ankle.Over time, the Poor Technique environment trains the poor alignment and inefficient muscle function to become the dysfunctional “norm.” As a result, the feet become increasingly weaker and more dependent on the artificial support/cushioning. This leads to footwear-related foot and ankle instability, poor lower limb alignment, and imbalanced muscle use that contributes to a wide range of problems and discomfort. BioPods Sneakers = Proper Technique Grounded in science and proven in practice, BioPods Stimsole Sneakers provide the subtle, varied stimulus to the soles of the feet and encourage the natural dynamic movement required for healthy function.This Proper Technique environment helps safely retrain and maintain healthy protective reflex function in your feet, legs, hips, and back, minimizing the risk of injury. By working in harmony with your natural foot movement, the cause of shoe-related problems and pain is eliminated.And best of all, BioPods Sneakers’ Proper Technique environment ensures exceptional comfort. Use BioPods Sneakers consistently for optimal benefits and get a pair of BioPods Stimsole Insoles as an Add-On to experience the BioPods' difference in your existing shoes!     Our revolutionary Stimsole Insoles turn your other shoes into a rehabilitative, performance enhancing experience. BioPods Stimsole Insoles create a comfortable “springy” sensation under your arches, providing your brain with the information it requires for optimal muscle activity in your lower limbs and back. BioPods Insoles are safe and easy to use and gradually help your feet, legs, hips, and back regain and maintain healthy function. Make your BioPods Urban and Urban Plus Sneakers fully waterproof. Add a Dintex waterproof, windproof, and breathable membrane between the shoe's upper, outer, and inner layers. When combined with the NeverWet DWR treatment your feet will stay dry in even the worst of weather. BioPods Repreve® socks are designed to enhance our footwear's stimulus properties. They are unbelievably soft and cozy, surprisingly breathable, and incredibly durable. And what’s even better, REPREVE® yarn, like our socks, is made in the USA. Each pair of BioPods REPREVE® Socks is made from 3 recycled plastic bottles that would otherwise pollute waterways and landfills. Available in white, grey, black, brown, blue, and amethyst, you will choose your color(s) after our campaign.  BioPods' bamboo athletic socks are designed to enhance our footwear's Stimulus properties and to help you take any workout to the next level. There are thousands of fitness socks on the market today but none with the combination of support (compression), softness, and design of our Sport Pro socks. Plus the odor resistance inherent in bamboo fiber means you can say goodbye to smelly workout socks for good.Inherent qualities of our socks' eco-friendly FSC certified bamboo fibers make them super soft and incredibly breathable - qualities that make these sustainable socks super cozy and the best socks for sweating feet!

With consistent use, they will help you reach your personal level of optimal function. Like any therapeutic exercise program, this retraining process takes time.Other than the few exceptions noted below, everyone, regardless of age and foot-related problem history will benefit from consistent use of BioPods Sneakers.In most instances, younger people and those without an extensive history of foot-related problems will respond very quickly, usually within a week or two. If you are older or have a long history of foot-related problems, it can take a month or two to regain your personal level of healthy function.Most importantly, every moment you are wearing shoes, they are training neuromuscular function. Therefore, for optimal benefits, BioPods Sneakers should be worn as often as possible. The more you are active and on your feet, the greater their benefits. Rehabilitation sticking pointsIf you have longstanding foot-related issues or lower limb/hip surgeries, in most instances, you will have developed inelastic scar tissue/fibrosis at one or more locations throughout the feet, legs, hips, and back. Often these fibrotic areas are not symptomatic because they aren’t being challenged by movement. These inelastic areas can become irritated and painful sticking points that impede the body’s adjustment towards healthier function.The good news is that these inelastic tissues are easily addressed by a Healthcare Professional using Soft Tissue Mobilization Therapies, such as deep tissue massage, ultrasound, Active Release Technique, and laser. After a few treatments, these tissues will regain their natural elasticity to allow the body’s continued adjustment towards healthy function. In more severe instances, there may be several layers of fibrotic/scar tissue (like layers of an onion), each becoming engaged and presenting symptoms only after an outer layer's inelasticity has been resolved. It is advisable to continue using your BioPods footwear as much as possible during this treatment and adjustment process.BioPods Sneaker Use ExceptionsThere are a few instances where BioPods Sneakers are not recommended or should only be used under a doctor’s supervision, as noted below:If you have bones fused in your feet, especially the toe-metatarsal joints, BioPods Sneakers are not recommended due to the Sneaker's extremely flexible toe area. If your toe-metatarsal joints are immobile, the Sneakers' flexibility can stress the fused joints.After surgery, your doctor may recommend specific weight-bearing limitations for a period of time. In these instances, check with your healthcare professional before using BioPods Stimsole Insoles and Sneakers.  Steve H. of Uxbridge, OntarioAs a long-time wearer of orthotics, after I tried BioPods Stimsoles, I threw my 30-year collection of custom inserts into the trash.BioPods have opened my eyes to the thousands of wasted dollars I spent trying to eliminate discomfort from using the antiquated inserts.I’m an active outdoor sports enthusiast who participates in a wide range of summer and winter sports, including trail running, kayaking, cycling, and snowboarding.I recently replaced my orthotics with two sets of BioPods.

<h3>Just because we get older, doesn't mean we have to get old.</h3>
<p>Once we reach our mid-twenties, our bodies lose the ability to produce collagen at a rate of approximately 1.5% every year. The skin becomes thinner, drier, and less elastic. The loss of collagen leads to wrinkle formation and the visible signs of ageing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>REGENESIS combines acoustic waves (sound) and phototherapy (light) with muscle inhibiting skincare and collagen building nutraceuticals to accelerate and fuel collagen production to slow the signs of aging, inside and out.</b></p>

<p><strong>+ Photo Therapy</strong><br/>The REGENESIS device uses a proven 633nm (red) light phototherapy. 633nm light has been shown in clinical studies to trigger collagen and elastin production.</p>
</div><p><strong> + Acoustic Vibration Massage</strong><br/>Acoustic shear stresses gently massage the skin to reduce fluid retention and improve lymphatic drainage to help reduce under eye bags, while the micro-oscillations stimulate the action of fibroblasts – the key to collagen production.</p><p> <strong>+ Muscle inhibiting Skincare</strong><br/>Our skincare fuels and accelerates the growth of new collagen and elastin, naturally refills wrinkles from within and reduces the intensity of muscle contractions to reduce future frown lines. Our formulas contain a combination of SPF30, Vitamin C, Copper Peptides, Matrixyl 3000 and Argireline in a unique Hyaluronic acid base. We use active concentrations that have been clinically shown to produced results.</p><p><strong>+ Advanced Nutrition</strong><br/>Our nutraceuticals contain a complex of Hydrolysed Marine Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E. These provide the body with the necessary building blocks for healthy skin cells and collagen, as well as maintaining appropriate stores of antioxidant defenses against free-radical damage. Our nutraceuticals contain only the highest quality, natural ingredients and use the lowest molecular weight collagen (over half the weight of the industry average) to help in the body since it is easier to absorb in the gut.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629119467/pjlmqorh9yjixacdtbx2.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>DEVELOPED IN THE UK BY OUR TEAM OF EXPERTS</h3><p>Founded in 2017 <strong>28 Day Skin</strong> has been developing Regenesis for the last three years from our inhouse laboratory in Gloucestershire, England. We have been financed in two successful rounds of seed funding investment through private and Angel investment.

<h3> </h3>
</div></div>","Just because we get older, doesn't mean we have to get old.
Once we reach our mid-twenties, our bodies lose the ability to produce collagen at a rate of approximately 1.5% every year. The skin becomes thinner, drier, and less elastic. The loss of collagen leads to wrinkle formation and the visible signs of ageing.
 
REGENESIS combines acoustic waves (sound) and phototherapy (light) with muscle inhibiting skincare and collagen building nutraceuticals to accelerate and fuel collagen production to slow the signs of aging, inside and out.
 

 
WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT USING REGENESIS


YOUTHFUL SKINOur patent pending Photo-Acoustic Wave technology accelerates collagen production using combined sound waves and red-light.


REDUCTION IN WRINKLES AND FINE LINESOur innovative skincare inhibits fine muscle movement to stop future fine lines and wrinkles while providing the building blocks for collagen synthesis.


HAPPIER SKIN INSIDE & OUTOur evidence based nutrition gives the fuel for collagen production and younger looking skin.


AN EASY ROUTINE OPTIMISED FOR THE BEST RESULTSThe synergistic combination of therapies fits into your existing daily routine.


 
 
OUR RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES
Regenesis works in harmony with your body for visibly younger looking skin, every day. We feel the results of our UK user trials speak for themselves. 
 YOUNGER LOOKING SKIN
98% of users experienced a significant improvement to the quality of their skin after 4 weeks.
 IMPROVED TEXTURE AND SKINTONE
  95% of users noticed improved texture, firmness and skin tone after 4 weeks.
 BRIGHTER & PLUMPER LOOKING SKIN
97% of users felt their skin looked brighter, plumper and had less redness after 2 weeks.
 REDUCE FINE LINES & WRINKLES
98% of users saw an improvement in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles after 12 weeks.
 IMPROVED SKIN ELASTICITY
55% of users felt their skin elasticity had measurably improved after 12 weeks.
 SKIN HYDRATION
62% of users saw an improvement in skin hydration and improved dull, tight and flaking skin.

 
 
HOW IT WORKS
REGENESIS combines four leading anti-ageing treatments in one synergistic therapy to activate, fuel and accelerate collagen production.
 
 
+ Photo TherapyThe REGENESIS device uses a proven 633nm (red) light phototherapy. 633nm light has been shown in clinical studies to trigger collagen and elastin production.
 + Acoustic Vibration MassageAcoustic shear stresses gently massage the skin to reduce fluid retention and improve lymphatic drainage to help reduce under eye bags, while the micro-oscillations stimulate the action of fibroblasts – the key to collagen production. + Muscle inhibiting SkincareOur skincare fuels and accelerates the growth of new collagen and elastin, naturally refills wrinkles from within and reduces the intensity of muscle contractions to reduce future frown lines. Our formulas contain a combination of SPF30, Vitamin C, Copper Peptides, Matrixyl 3000 and Argireline in a unique Hyaluronic acid base. We use active concentrations that have been clinically shown to produced results.+ Advanced NutritionOur nutraceuticals contain a complex of Hydrolysed Marine Collagen, Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E. These provide the body with the necessary building blocks for healthy skin cells and collagen, as well as maintaining appropriate stores of antioxidant defenses against free-radical damage. Our nutraceuticals contain only the highest quality, natural ingredients and use the lowest molecular weight collagen (over half the weight of the industry average) to help in the body since it is easier to absorb in the gut.  DEVELOPED IN THE UK BY OUR TEAM OF EXPERTSFounded in 2017 28 Day Skin has been developing Regenesis for the last three years from our inhouse laboratory in Gloucestershire, England. We have been financed in two successful rounds of seed funding investment through private and Angel investment.

<p><strong>Since 2014…we’ve been redesigning dental products at TIO...</strong></p>
<p>...environmentally friendly AND at the highest quality level of tooth care! To achieve this, we’re constantly battling to advance as pioneers in the field of plant-based plastics. We want to prove in our own way that pollution can be avoided. Because sustainable redesign of an everyday object, such as dental floss, which billions of people use every day, can have a huge, positive impact on our environment. Read on to find out why we rethink, reduce and reuse.</p>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>To reach the next level we need your support!</strong></p>
<p>We operate on comparably small profit margins with TIO and a big investment required to make TIOFLOSS happen is the creation of two injection moulding tools for our dispenser: One for the top and one for the bottom half.  We can then set up the manufacturing process and start the first production run. Your support would also allow us to purchase the required raw materials and cover our manufacturing partner’s operating costs during the first round of TIOFLOSS production for our supporters. </p>

...environmentally friendly AND at the highest quality level of tooth care! To achieve this, we’re constantly battling to advance as pioneers in the field of plant-based plastics. We want to prove in our own way that pollution can be avoided. Because sustainable redesign of an everyday object, such as dental floss, which billions of people use every day, can have a huge, positive impact on our environment. Read on to find out why we rethink, reduce and reuse.
 
To reach the next level we need your support!
We operate on comparably small profit margins with TIO and a big investment required to make TIOFLOSS happen is the creation of two injection moulding tools for our dispenser: One for the top and one for the bottom half.  We can then set up the manufacturing process and start the first production run. Your support would also allow us to purchase the required raw materials and cover our manufacturing partner’s operating costs during the first round of TIOFLOSS production for our supporters. 
 Our newly developed TIOFLOSS might seem like a small step at first sight... ...but it’s big step for us—and mankind. Trailblazing doesn’t come easy (especially when production lines suddenly stand still in a pandemic) and we kindly ask for your support to get TIOFLOSS set up for production and push the use of TIO’s plant-based floss to the next level by reducing packaging even further with a reusable case.    Why it’s really time to make a changeThe ecological damage caused by the increasing amount of waste humans produce every day is immense. Climate change and the pollution of oceans are the first of many consequences if we don’t make significant changes in the manufacturing of consumer goods. Due to their very short lifespan, personal hygiene products like dental ones are a key segment. Here's the sad reality of a single-use dispenser... The impact reusable floss dispensers could haveFollowing your dentist's advice - flossing once a day with 0,5m (20′′) of floss - results in the consumption of 4-5 single use containers per year. Empty single use floss containers and their packaging in the U.S. would create ~ 15.000 tons of plastic waste. And that’s just for one year! Just in the United States! (According to Statista, 235.8 million Americans used dental floss / flossers / picks in 2020)   At TIO we minimize packaging wherever we canWhen designing our products, we place great emphasis on minimal material usage to preserve resources. We avoid unnecessary waste through newly invented refill concepts to relieve our ecosystem. Our refills will be packaged in an innovative paper-based, FSC-certified and recyclable material. Plants over plastic and a future without drillingWe want a clean conscience and clean teeth: Instead of conventional plastic made of petroleum, we use plant-based bioplastics for all parts from yarn to dispenser. These renewable raw materials enable us to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the fatal consequences of fossil fuel extraction, such as fracking or tanker accidents.  The foundation of our floss and dispenser are renewable, vegetable raw materials. This saves CO₂ and allows you and many other people to clean up their carbon footprint and teeth. Our extensive material research helped us cut down green house gases by 55% compared to ordinary petro-based materials. Through downstream technical and procurement improvements, the carbon footprint can even be further reduced to just 22% of ordinary products. The TIOFLOSS materials separate it from…the wasteful rest.Beyond the drastical improvement of the carbon footprint, there are many other benefits. The original plant used for our organic raw material is the fast-growing wonder tree that does not require large amounts of water, uses only a small acreage of farmland and is therefore perfectly suited for a future of sustainable agriculture. Furthermore the castor bean is inedible which makes the TIOFLOSS unique regarding it's minimal harm to our planet and the people living on it. By the way…these guys want to thank you :) The process: From the field – to the press – to youIf you're now wondering whether this sounds a little too good to be true: Since our floss doesn't completely grow on trees we would love to quickly explain how it’s actually made because unfortunately using the type of plastic we use is still kind of unusual.

Therefore, if you don't know the child, it’s impossible in an emergency to get information on what condition the child has. There is a current solution, however it’s complicated and doesn’t take advantage of today's technology.This is what led us to create MedsBag-  The first- ever wearable audio action plan, made for children carrying life-critical medicine. MedsBag digitizes the old and outdated written medical action plan and brings emergency protocol into the 21st century. It is easy to activate and easy to operate.We want MedsBag to signal an insightful awareness of a serious state, showing the public that the child carries life- critical medicine. The bag will be a symbol for inclusion, counteracting stigma and empowering the everyday heroes.Besides the fact that there are 500 million children carrying life- critical medicine, we have a personal relationship to this matter.We are a family of five where the youngest one, Matteo (12), has asthma and anaphylaxis, a more severe type of allergic reaction most often caused by exposure to allergenic substances. Ever since Matteo was 5 months old we have carried with us adrenaline and an inhaler.We quickly understood that an extremely low percentage of our community would know  what his condition was if he would get an allergic chock. Therefore, it was always very frightening to let him out the door alone where there are possible enemies wherever he goes and potentially no allies to call for help. He needed to carry much more than just a paper with instructions, he needed an ally that had his back wherever he went, the MedsBag.Even though, we as a family were scared that something would happen to him when we weren't with him, we were determined to allow him to move freely and without limitation through his upbringing. It was also important for us that Matteo never felt he should hide his conditions. Matteo, and all 500 million children with the same need, is our why.MedsBag is a fashionable and multifunctional bag for children to keep with them at all times. It’s equipped with a recordable speaker on the outside and is designed to store proper medication, inhalers, syringes, autoinjectors and more. The speaker is easy to access and provides recorded instructions from the caregiver. MedsBag supports all languages and unique conditions as you record it yourself. Every MedsBag will have a QR code. The code will be added into the informational pocket together with the name and picture of your child. When scanning the QR code the bystander will be directed to the same recorded instruction as the recorded in the audio device and can be used if the speaker malfunctions. How MedsBag works

 

How to use 
Today's solution doesn’t work, and far too few even know about it. The written action- plan is outdated, hard to understand and unknown for most. You don’t only have to know about the written action plan, you also have to find it, read it, understand it, and finally, after all those steps, act.   We chose the color blue because Matteo has always carried a blue bag, therefore it felt very natural to have the first version of MedsBag in blue. Also, it’s the color of clean air, and we just love blue?Lack of statistics: Sadly, there is limited research and data focused on children carrying life- critical medicine. Therefore, it’s hard to know how many everyday heroes there actually are out there. But here is some statistics we've found that supports our market and how big it is, and how it's growing exponentially.Asthma: 339 million people worldwide live with asthma & its prevalence increases by 50%every decade.Epilepsy: 13 million worldwide live with epilepsy.Diabetes: 422 million people worldwide live with diabetes & increased by 88% between 2000-2009.Anaphylaxis: 1 in 13 children in the US live with food allergies where 30% have been treated, at least once, in the ER.Statistics from our survey480 respondentsWe are now ready to begin large scale production.

Our valves allow you to breathe out easier. They prevent humidity and reduce uncomfortable heat and carbon dioxide buildup inside the mask.

VALVE DEACTIVATOR SEALS


The valve masks adequately protect the wearer. However, when breathing out some particles can escape.

That's why we offer valve deactivator seals as add-on purchases to provide two-way protection.

5 colors will complement your outfit every day. 
We keep it simple and let the colors do the talking. We've worked tirelessly to ensure that every shade and every glow matches the tone of the design---and looks great!
Our shades are inspired by scenes of nature and the details we found in them.
 

Our colourful filter packs are easily replaceable---making them adaptive to your mood while always keeping you protected. Switch them up with ease---whenever you want.Plus, the filters are gently infused with essential oils so you get that “just entered the spa” feeling whenever you put it on. Choose from the range of essential oils depending on your mood on a given day.

New brands have come up, new designs and new needs. The good thing is, we are not new to it. The Air Mask Premium Look and Air Filtration has been years in the making and happens to be uniquely suited to life in the new normal.
 
Here is our development timeline, from the idea, to getting the team together, starting the concept process (sourcing, 3D rendering, sampling) and finalizing the Air Mask.

Because of this, wearable blood pressure monitoring devices have become a trend.
BP Trace is developed to be a smartwatch-type blood pressure monitor utilizing self-initiated automatic oscillometric technology that allows you to measure your blood pressure anytime, anywhere. With the FDA & CE approved accuracy and statistical analysis on its app, BP Trace can make your health management easier than ever before.



BP Trace is designed to be smart, simple, and efficient for those who need to check their blood pressure frequently. To get a new blood pressure reading, press the activation button and raise and hold your hand over your heart. The cuff will automatically inflate and deflate on its own, and get your result in seconds.







BP Trace does the same job as a traditional device and offers the same results, but “big”, “heavy”, “hard-to-use” are now things of the past. The smart technology of today allows BP Trace to be wearable, convenient, and totally user-friendly.Size, portability, data storage, monitoring frequency, and ease-of-use make BP Trace superior to any traditional upper-arm oscillometric machine. There’s simply no comparison.BP Trace employs the commonly recognized oscillometric technology along with new micro air inflation technology that holds multiple international patents. This device measures your blood pressure just as accurately as a regular upper-arm oscillometric device, like those typically used by doctors and other medical professionals.The auto-inflating mini air-cuff is embedded underneath the strap to read both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, just like the thick cuff of a traditional device that is usually placed on the upper arm.As one of the pioneering devices in the smart health device industry, BP Trace has been certified for its data accuracy by both the FDA and Medical CE. The inflatable cuff design and oscillatory technology used in BP Trace has multiple international patents as well.In the following video, we demonstrated how to use BP Trace to check your blood pressure. We also e made a few comparisons with a traditional oscillometric monitor like those used in clinics and hospitals. Below are screenshots of the blood pressure readings from the video.In the first test, we completed a resting blood pressure reading with both a BP Trace and a traditional device. When we compared the results of the two devices, they were almost identical. The close-ups below show that the two results varied only slightly. (Please note that a deviation of up to 5 mmHg is still considered medically acceptable).The second test was done to compare the accuracy of a dynamic blood pressure reading. The tester did some light physical activity before measuring his blood pressure a second time. The results showed a small fluctuation in his heart rate and blood pressure but were overall still very accurate.*International ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060‐2:2013 guideline for the validation study (Criterion 1: Mean and standard deviation (SD) for the difference of the device minus the observer BP measurements ≤±5 and ≤8 mm Hg, respectively).In Conclusion - For both active and resting measurements, BP Trace can measure blood pressure and heart rate accurately. However, we truly believe this product has the potential to become even more accurate., We will continue to do rigorous testing and further improve the product, and we guarantee to deliver a completely standardized final product by the final release.As the rate of hypertension increases dramatically around the world, we noticed that there has been an increase in the number of people who do not realize they have hypertension or maybe in the stage of prehypertension. The following are some signs of and contributors to possible hypertension.If you are experiencing one of these symptoms or engage in these behaviors, you may need to start managing your health. With BP Trace, you can help prevent hypertension and some illnesses it may cause, such as: Hypertension Complications：Diabetes, Hyperlipidemia, High Triglycerides，Hyperuricemia，Metabolicsyndrome，Stroke，Coronary Artery Disease，Heart Failure，COPD，Rheumatism，Psychological DiseaseDuring pregnancy, hypertension can lead to abruptio placentae，kidney failure，liver failure, DIC, and more.AMBP (Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure) is the golden standard for diagnosing hypertension and is the only effective method to assess blood pressure 24/7. It requires measurement every 15~30min during the day and every 30~60min during the night. According to the largest hypertension registry “The Spanish Society of Hypertension Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Registry”, 24-hour AMBP is 30% higher than clinical blood pressure for hypertension management.AMBP (Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure) is the golden standard for diagnosing hypertension.Most so-called health monitors with a low price cannot provide accurate results. On the other hand, carrying a bulky traditional blood pressure device is just not practical. We invented BP Trace to be a wearable device with medical-grade accuracy while utilizing strict AMBP measurements to reflect multiple aspects of your health.Being diagnosed with hypertension is usually based on multiple blood pressure readings over time, and only severe cases receive immediate drug treatment. To aid in the diagnosis, management, and estimate of risk in patients with hypertension, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is becoming a necessity. However, this type of constant observation is almost impossible outside of a healthcare facility and can be quite intrusive and inconvenient.BP Trace is the solution to this problem. This 24-hour active monitor is wearable, auto-sampling, and fully persistent. Simply put it on your wrist, and let the self-initiated automatic oscillometric cuff check your blood pressure at regular intervals throughout the day. With BP Trace, you can easily obtain useful information including:
24-hour average blood pressure
Average daytime blood pressure
Average nighttime blood pressure
Calculated percentage drop in blood pressure at night
Easily check your blood pressure variability throughout the day. Export data from the app to calculate your average blood pressure. The app provides comprehensive data to help you understand your personal health.The BP Trace app stores multiple types of health-related data. As you continue to use BP Trace over time, each result is saved and analyzed to create trends, ranging from hourly to yearly. Most patients go to the doctor’s office without any descriptive or concrete references for diagnosis. This can not only waste time during a first-time medical examination but also doesn’t provide the doctor with any solid information about your past conditions. The long-lasting battery life allows BP Trace to run its tracking program throughout the day and provides you with medication reminders and warnings for abnormal readings. By observing weekly trends, this device can help you make progress with your health management and help consolidate all the information necessary for a new diagnosis.For patients that require long-term care and continual health management, weekly, monthly, or even yearly data may sometimes be required, and BP Trace can easily fill these requirements. BP Trace lets you track your measurements over multiple periods of time using smart charts, trends, and stats. With the BP Trace app you can easily share your measurements and progress with your doctor, friends, and family, or export them anywhere through email. The BP Trace app can export data in both pdf and excel files. With our lifetime free cloud storage, all of your data can be downloaded easily for a deeper analysis.Choose custom time periods (intervals) and frequencies for blood pressure sampling based on your own preferences or your doctor's advice. Just follow a few simple steps and wait for auto-measurements to begin.*A notification will appear 1 minute in advance.To accommodate the need for continuous measurement, we also optimized BP Trace’s battery life. Under standard conditions (default setting), the device can complete up to 20 blood pressure measurements a day and can be used for 3 days, which makes it an ideal portable health monitor.Blood pressure can change dramatically from morning to night, and while you sleep. It’s important to keep track of these fluctuations, and BP Trace continues to monitor your blood pressure even during the night without disturbing your sleep.Family happiness is the ultimate goal of our medical technology. We included a feature in the BP Trace app to enable you to share data with family members by linking your accounts. This feature lets you check the wearer’s condition in real-time, no matter how far away you are.ZTlifenets is a sister company to Kingyield Technology Co., Ltd.

The bottle and cup each full sized (18oz bottle / 12oz cup), double walled, vacuum insulated, stainless steel, leak-proof, and BPA free. With a bottle you'll love, and a cup that's always with you, go zero waste and carry better.   
   
 
  

 
Hitch's patent-pending design makes it easy to carry your bottle and cup together. Simply turn the crossbar on the bottom, and the cup releases from the bottle.  
 
  When we set out to create Hitch, we talked to lots of people who carry reusable water bottles, and most wouldn't carry a reusable cup because it was either too much too carry everything, or too easy to forget at home.  Simply making a tiny water bottle and tiny cup wouldn't cut it--people wanted a full size water bottle for all day hydration, a reusable cup large enough for a standard coffee drink with a lid that won't leak, and a way to carry both that was space efficient and easy to hold.  In fact, we wanted it to be so easy, that people could go zero waste. 
 Single-use paper cups and plastic bottles create a lot of waste. With Hitch, we've made the reusable bottle and cup so easy to carry, that you can go zero waste and lighten your load.  
 
 We're including A FREE Bottle Protector with every Hitch. It's a flexible weatherproof cap that fits on the top or bottom of your bottle.  Protects the cup lid when it's on top, and when your cup is out, use it as a cap to protect the bottom of your bottle.  
 
 
   *We have updated this feature to make it even easier to use, see our most recent update for details.*
 
 

  
 
 
 
 

   Hitch is compact and easy to carry. It fits naturally in your hand where the bottle tapers in, much like a carafe. And at 9.5"" tall, it can easily fit in a tote bag, messenger bag, or a backpack. We also designed the Hitch bottle and cup to fit in most cupholders.     
 
 Hitch's cup is perfect for life on the go. When you're not using it, your cup is protected from the elements inside the bottle. When you're ready, the cup is the right size for coffee shop drinks (12oz), it's vacuum insulated to keep drinks warm, and has a leak proof and easy to drink from slider lid to keep things neat and clean. 
  

  If you use a paper cup at the coffee shop daily, it takes on average an entire tree worth of paper to make those cups a year. By using Hitch, you save a trees worth of cups annually. We also plant a tree when you pledge for a Hitch. We do it through our partnership with One Tree Planted, whose reforestation projects plant trees that clean our air and water, create habitats for biodiversity, and create jobs for social impact.   If you use plastic bottles, much of that plastic isn't recycled but shipped to the developing world, where it ends up in rivers and waterways that flow into the ocean. By using Hitch, you prevent plastic bottles from reaching the ocean. We also prevent 100 plastic bottles from reaching the ocean with every you pledge for a Hitch through our partnership with Plastic Bank. They create impact in areas with high levels of plastic pollution, by supporting people to collect ocean bound plastic and turn it into a currency.   
   

 

  We set out to create the perfect reusable solution to carry your bottle and cup effortlessly. We knew it needed to be a great bottle, that carried its own cup inside, with the ability to carry enough water and coffee for an on-the-go lifestyle. After lots of concepts, prototypes, user testing, and refinement, we created Hitch.   
 
 At Remaker Labs, we want to make life easier and more sustainable for everyone who carries food and drinks on the go.  As we look to the future, we're all about transforming our disposable-first culture into one that values sustainable living. In order to do that, we want to create storage solutions that offer a high level of convenience, yet are sustainable made and help people go zero waste. This idea, which we call 'conscious carry', is at the heart of what we do.   Spread The Word      Press Kit  Shipping DetailsWe are glad to be able to share Hitch with the world, with shipping available to more than 150 countries worldwide. Depending on your country, in some instances you may be responsible for paying duty, taxes or other applicable fees before you can receive your package. These policies are set locally, so please check with the relevant sources where you live for the most accurate information.As part of our commitment to climate positivity, all shipping for Hitch is carbon neutral (certified by our partners at Climate Neutral.) Wherever possible, we will be working with postal services (as opposed to express shippers) which use existing routes and are the most environmentally friendly way to get a package to your door.We are working closely with our manufacturing partner to ensure that every single Hitch meets our exacting standards.

<p>Since the times of the pharaohs in ancient Egypt, people have relied on crystal alum for a variety of uses</p>

<p>It was used as a <i>deodorant</i></p>
<p>It was used in <i>energy healing (mainly a remedy to evil eye)</i></p>

<p>Its use as a deodorant has been widely known, not only throughout time but also space, its use is present in <i><strong>Indian cultures</strong></i>, <i><strong>ancient Chinese</strong></i> and is still used by <i><strong>African tribes</strong></i> to this day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From generation to generation, we’ve transformed its use from raw stone to refined powder, for a more <i><strong>effective</strong></i> use, and evidently more <i><strong>sustainable</strong></i> one (although I’m not sure that was our ancestors concern at the time)</p>

<p><i><strong>Deodorant, the natural way:</strong></i></p>
<p>Body odor occurs not because of sweat, but rather because of bacteria that thrives in dark and humid places (ie: armpits, genitals and feet), that's why hand sweat doesn't smell.</p>
<p>Said bacteria (namely Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Cutibacterium avidum) lunches on the waste present in sweat, causing bad odors in the process.</p>
<p>Crysteous is made of a natural live crystal, upon contact with wetness its particles try to get back to their natural crystal form.</p>
<p>Trying to recrystallize, particles form a layer that separates bacteria from waste present in sweat, starving said bacteria and preventing smells while active.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623274716/s4msrxgqjyl2iutyda2l.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Sweat less, sweat still... naturally:</strong></i></p>
<p>Sweating is a natural process that aids the body to rid itself of its toxins, once we understand that, we don't want to completely halt the sweating process because that will trap toxins in our bodies, toxins that were supposed to be ridden of.</p>
<p>The second reason we sweat is to cool off, that's why we sweat a lot more in heat than in cold.</p>
<p>As a live salt, Crysteous acts on your pores by shrinking them (most commercial antiperspirants clog them instead) just like your face shrinks when you bite on a lemon.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Walid,</p>
<p>5 years ago, I moved from Algeria in north Africa to the USA.</p>
<p>After a year or so, I consumed all my deodorant powder stash so I had to switch to a commercial alternative.</p>
<p>After a while of using, I started noticing problems I didn’t use to have, like my shirts would get stained, sometimes if I have a long day the smell of the deodorant turns bad, making me smell even worse than my natural body odor.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That was disturbing, how could something you use to combat odor makes you smell even worse!</p>
<p>I awaited the next opportunity when I travelled home, and got myself a big jar this time, and forgot all about the incident.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a couple of years, when I was driving my cab in NYC, an old man with a white beard gets in, we started chatting, he told me he was an entrepreneur, he said that taking the leap and going into business changed his life and perception (I had no idea what that meant), then he asks, if you could create any kind of business, what would you do?</p>
<p>After a couple seconds I said, I would bring my culture’s deodorant to the USA.</p>
<p>He asked, why won’t you do it?</p>
<p>And I started rambling about how big corporations controlled the market and that there was no way that a person like me could succeed in such a marketplace.</p>
<p>He listened for a while, then we got to his stop.</p>
<p>He got out, and right before closing the door, he said: Do it.</p>
<p>And left.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It took me a couple years to move from the person that was too focused on obstacles and excuses, to the person that recognizes and focuses on the opportunity at hand, which is the ability to serve both my community of origin and the community that welcomed me into their own. All while serving a higher good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With this personality change, I had to figure out the ""Why"" behind Crysteous, over a couple months, its values began to take shape, bit by bit, that lead to Crysteous' mission and vision.</p>
<p>We envision a startup focused on sustainable, natural and affordable toiletry. A startup that serves a higher purpose. A startup that aims to share its fruit with the community that believed in it and gave it utility.</p>

</div></div>","Since the pyramids era, people have dealt with body odor with Alum Crystal, making it the first known deodorant in history.
Through generations of use, we transformed it to powder, for a more convenient, effective and sustainable use.
Many people and cultures across the world have used and are still using this deodorant for its effectiveness, its low cost and longevity.

 
If only there was a deodorant that is Earth friendly, Body friendly and Community driven.
 

 
Hi, my name is Crysteous,
In my hometown they call me Chebb, but you can call me Crysteous, which means like a Crystal.
I was created to help solve the above three problems, and I intend to do that by:
1. Being completely plastic free
2. Made of ONE natural ingredient
3. Focus on empowering communities 
If you're reading this, it means you have a direct impact on whether I succeed in the first hurdle of my journey, the hurdle of being born that is!







 


 



We have created this brand as a link between the conscious western customer and villages in Africa that are already making this deodorant for a living.
Crystals mined and transformed to powder by locals are then sent in bulk to the US where they will be packed by Crysteous in a beautiful glass jar and compostable paper refills, for the least carbon footprint possible.
Crysteous aims to bring these two communities together in an honest and purposeful trade, that would result in providing clean water to communities in need, spreading love and promoting life.



Eco-Friendly: One glass jar lasts one year, after that, refills come in compostable paper. for the lowest impact on the planet.
Unscented: Most other deodorants leave you smelling worse than your natural scent at the end of the day. NOT Crysteous.
Truly effective: A small pinch applied to the center of your armpit keeps you odorless for more than 48h. period. 
Purposeful: Crysteous is not just another product you can buy, it is one on a mission and pursuing a purpose, probably just like you are.  
Leaves no stains: Leaves no stains on your shirt, and leaves no stains on your skin.
Handmade: No added chemicals, no unnecessary waste due to machinery, Crysteous is handmade, with love.
Affordable: Your daily habits shouldn't cost so much! when you buy a jar of Crysteous, you're buying a year's worth of natural deodorant.

<p>To put it simply, as our device turns on, the fan circulates harmful substances through the air. Its basic principle works by turning photocatalyst into super oxidizing hydroxyl radicals under the energy of UVC light, which in turn breaks down organic compounds into water and carbon dioxide. </p>
</div>
<p>The photocatalyst particle width is smaller than microbes so its effective surface area is exponentially increased due to its indirect principle. The photocatalyst is not depleted in the process as long as it exists on the material surface. Its effects are indefinite with just a trigger of UVC light.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions </h1>
<p><b>Learn More - Be.’s lifetime warranty, perk details and how it works. </b></p>
<p><b>Why should I buy Be. with a high international shipping cost? </b>We've heard your concerns with shipping, and want you to know we've done our homework to get this cost as low as possible. At this time, what we can offer is an additional year's supply of brush heads with all international orders for FREE, a $20 USD value. That's 4 additional brush refills on top of the year supply that already comes with every Be. </p>
<p><b>How much does it actually cost Goodwell + Co to ship internationally?</b> If you check usps.com, a $50 item shipping from Portland, Oregon (our Headquarters) to London, UK is $22.50. This doesn't include packaging materials and labor costs. The total with those additional costs is more than $25. We hope our added extra brush heads with each international purchase lessens this cost burden and we truly appreciate your understanding.</p>
<p><b>What is the Sustainable Lifetime Product Promise?</b> We believe that sustainability is not only what your products are made of, but also how they are made, and how long they last. We promise that you will be able to use Be. for a lifetime. Unlike all other powered toothbrushes, we built ours so that it can be worked on and repaired, and if anything ever goes wrong with your Be., we'll repair or replace it, for free (you pay for shipping).</p>
<p><b>When can I expect to receive my Be.?</b> We will be diligently updating our post-campaign status, we want everyone who helped us reach our goal to have transparency on where we are at in the process. Right now, the plan is to have all of the kickstarter backers their Be.'s in-hand by December 2018.</p>
<p><b>Why will it take that long to fulfill?</b> A year may seem like a long time to wait for your Be. brush, but to put it in perspective - our team has brought literally hundreds of products to market, and the average time it takes to do it successfully is 18 months from start to finish. We are pushing really hard to get this done in 12 and if we get it done sooner, you will be the first to know!</p>
<p><b>How do I use the Be. brush?</b> It's super easy - Step 1: put a pea-sized dab of toothpaste on the bristles, Step 2 : give the dial on the bottom end of the brush 2 full twists, Step 3: press down on the power button - that's it!</p>
<p><b>How do I stop it if I don't want to brush for 2 minutes?</b> Great question, the only thing that is different about using the Be. brush is that you have to give it a twist before you use it, otherwise, you just use it like it's your favorite electric toothbrush. To turn it off, just hit the power button. Note that you have some power left in your brush, so the next time you use it, you may not need to give it the full 2 twists.</p>
<p><b>What happens if I over-twist it?</b> We've designed it to stop when it's fully charged, so you should actually twist it until it stops being able to twist. You can't over-twist, so as our pal Sam Cooke says ""twist the night away""!</p>
<p><b>Can Be. get wet?</b> Be. is designed to be in extreme environments, the outdoors and even in space (yes, space, it's the unofficial toothbrush of space), so yeah get it wet, it will be just fine.</p>
<p><b>My dentist recommended that I only use an electric toothbrush, is Be. dentist recommended?</b> We have shown Be. to a handful of professionals in Portland, and the feedback has been nothing but great. We are taking the steps to get Be officially recommended by the ADA as well as endorsed by local dental practices.</p>
<p><b>What is Binchotan?</b> Binchotan is essentially the best version of activated charcoal, which has been used for decades in things like air and water purification. Activated charcoal helps eliminate foul odors in your mouth, as well as balance the pH and fight the germs that cause gingivitis and tooth decay.</p>
<p><b>How do I get brush refills?</b> If you need more brush refills, they will be available on our website at <a href=""http://www.thegoodwellcompany.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thegoodwellcompany.com</a>, as well as stores across the US. If you want us to be carried at your local store, please reach out to us via email, and put us in touch with your local grocery or retail.</p>
<p><b>The brush refills are biodegradable?</b> Yes! We have put so much effort into creating a commodity product that has little to no impact on the environment, our brush refills are compostable and biodegradable, when you are done with them you can toss them in the compost, in your trash or just bury them! They take around 270 days to decompose.</p>
<p><b>How many brush refills come in the 1-year supply of replacement heads? </b>Be. comes with 1 head on it and 4 in the box, so 5 heads total. The annual refill packs will be 4 as well.</p>
<b>I thought Binchotan Charcoal Bristles were black?</b> You may notice that in some pictures we are using white and blue bristles, and in others we are using black bristles. Why is this? These are all prototypes, so we are using the materials we have on-hand at the moment, but in the production units, the bristles will indeed be Black, activated charcoal infused bristles.<div> <p><b>Are your products cruelty-free and vegan?</b> Yes they are! All of our products are not tested on animals, vegan, and carbon neutral.</p>
<p><b>Can I change my perk?</b> Kickstarter has now made it easier than ever to upgrade your perks. Learn more <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/backer+questions#faq_63084"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>

</div></div>","Be. stands for Beyond Electric. Unlike electric toothbrushes, Be. is more than just a vibrating head. Built as a kinetic storage device, Be. harnesses and amplifies the power of 2 simple twists into over 80,000 tartar fighting brush strokes using its patented multiplier transmission system.       Battery & Electric-Free - Brushing with Be. means no cables, no batteries, and no problems. Transform your daily brushing routine into a simple 3-step process: put toothpaste on the bristles, give the dial two full twists, hit the power button and let Be. work its magic. Sustainable - Practice zero waste at home with Be.’s 100% biodegradable brush heads and recyclable build. The first toothbrush that gives you all the benefits of clean teeth, at no expense to the earth. Smart Technology - Be.'s smart sensor operates at the ADA recommended precise tartar-fighting pressure of 120g, training you to brush thoroughly but consciously. With 80,000 charcoal infused brushstrokes at the perfect pressure, you're off brushing for a diamond clean smile. Travel-Friendly - Whether you're traveling for business, backpacking outdoors or just bringing your toothbrush to work, Be. keeps up with your on-the-go lifestyle. The snap-on case creates an easy to carry cylinder and fits 1 extra brush refill for extended travel. 
 

 
 

          All the power and performance of an electric toothbrush, minus the waste. The best version of you and your planet by brushing with Be.    Simplify Your Routine - Be. keeps your daily brushing routine easy, similar to your manual brush. 
If electric toothbrushes are so good, why do the majority of people still use manual toothbrushes? Well, manual is easy, and as a species we like easy things. If you haven’t made the switch to electric yet, don’t! We have good news. With no batteries, PCB boards, soldering, or wires, Be. is still a manual toothbrush for all intents and purposes. Two twists of the dial and no charging needed has you brushing like you would with your manual toothbrush, but with 10x the cleaning power.    Improve your Dental Health - A deeper clean that changes your tartar fighting game.  Most dentists will suggest using an electric toothbrush to get that diamond clean smile. Why? It’s proven they do a better job at getting debris out of your teeth, avoiding plaque, cavities and tooth decay. With over 80,000 brushstrokes, Be. has more power than your average electric toothbrush, cleaning deeper and whitening faster so you never have to worry about compromising your oral hygiene for sustainability. As the ultimate hybrid, you get the best of both worlds by brushing with Be.         Every year, 15 billion batteries are discarded worldwide and only 1% of them are recycled. We know it’s bad but let’s face it, it’s hard to feel like one person can actually make a difference...until now. A vital part of your everyday just turned eco-friendly with no added effort. Be. is 100% recyclable, biodegradable and, of course, battery-free, making every brush a daily step towards reducing our carbon footprint and the release of toxins into the environment.    Minimize Your Waste - Everything down to Be.’s packaging, is considered and conscious. Be. is made from 90% post-consumer material and is 100% recyclable, biodegradable, and of course, battery-free. Be. has developed a proprietary material made of starches and bamboo that is 100% biodegradable and compostable. This material is used in all of it’s premium brush heads, which are engineered to be as small and as efficient as possible. Every purchase of Be. comes with a 1-year supply of replacement heads to minimize the energy and carbon of bi-monthly refill shipping. Don’t forget recyclable packaging too!     With 80,000 oscillating brush strokes per brushing, Be. uses Binchotan, also known as activated charcoal, in its biodegradable bristles to help with Ph balancing, odor absorption and anti-microbial purification. While Be. is deep cleaning at lightning speed, it’s also consciously aware of how much pressure you’re applying at all times.    A Stroke Speed that goes Beyond Electric - Be.’s patented technology doubles down on the most efficient way to clean. Be. has fine tuned its internal patented Be. Clean Technology to deliver a whopping 80,000 brush strokes per brushing. After 2 minutes, it automatically shuts down and needs a simple twist to get back to brushing. If you were to use a manual toothbrush and brush your teeth 80,000 times it would take you over 4 hours. Put simply: What a manual toothbrush does in 4 hours, Be. gets done in 2 minutes.    Save your Gums - Be.’s smart pressure sensor is built to stop you from over-brushing. While it’s not common knowledge, the American Dental Association recommends brushing your teeth at 120g of pressure, or in other words, the weight of an orange. Be. is designed to operate at the exact 120g pressure, halting agitation when the limit is exceeded and training users to brush thoroughly, but consciously. This technology will help save tooth enamel, reduce gum recession, increase the longevity of bristles and keep costly dental bills to a minimum.   Purify with Activated Charcoal - Innate Benefits infused in each bristle. Binchotan, which may sound more familiar when referred to as activated charcoal, is infused in all of Be.’s brush heads. Today you might find activated charcoal in ‘detox’ drinks, but traditionally it has been used for air and water purification. Be. has now incorporated it’s innate benefits to target mouth odor, balance Ph, and stop unwanted anti-microbial growth. With every oscillating brush stroke, your teeth, gums and breath are getting a healthy dose of binchotan to combat signs of gingivitis for a healthier mouth.          Be. is everything you love about your electric toothbrush but wireless, so you’re never tied down. Be adventurous, go outdoors and live life the way you planned.      Made for You - Limitless usability designed with you in mind. Gone are the days of needed charging stations, cables and plug adapters for travel. Brush your teeth at the airport, on the plane, in a forest! The boundaries are endless. Whether you are a sales manager, a backpacker or a touring musician, you’ll appreciate the freedom of not having to plug yet another thing in. Cut out excess baggage when you bring Be. to work and avoid the dreaded scenario of your brush running out of power on the road. Be.’s versatility makes it perfect for anyone, from the mountains to your 9 to 5.    Do more with less - Power never looked so simple. Weighing in at just 6oz and only 6in tall, which is approximately 2 inches shorter than some of the newest products on the market, Be. is designed to fit in your purse, in your desk compartment, or in that last bit of space left in your almost overweight carry-on. When you are constantly on the move and trying to manage space for your essentials, size matters, and Be. makes the cut.   Snap-on and go - The perfect case you didn’t have to purchase separately. Be.’s travel case simply snaps onto the toothbrush housing, perfectly matching the body design to create an easy to carry cylinder you can bring everywhere. It protects your brush head from dirt and debris while travelling, as well as any bathroom mishaps when it’s on your sink counter. The snap-on case can also house 1 extra brush refill for extended travel so you keep what you need for clean teeth in one place.          Made from simple materials that are 100% recyclable - Be. is light so you move freely.         Every year, 15 billion batteries are discarded worldwide. 87% of of them end up in landfills, 12% of them are incinerated, and just 1% are recycled. If we lined up all the batteries back to back that the world uses in just one year, it would be 466,000 miles long. That is long enough to wrap around the globe 18 times! When it comes to Lithium batteries in particular, the stuff is downright nasty. Lithium is flammable and highly reactive, as anyone who has seen photos of a burning hoverboard can attest - but that’s the least of our worries. The EPA has linked the use of extremely powerful solvents in the creation of lithium electrolytes and cathodes to everything from cancer to neurological problems. Specifically, the cobalt used in the creation of the most energy dense lithium-ion batteries is poisonous and extremely carcinogenic.   Tooth decay is the most widespread chronic disease worldwide. It’s most common as a childhood disease, but it affects people of all ages throughout their lifetime. Untreated tooth decay causes pain, and it affects 7 out of 10 children in India, 1 out of 3 teenagers in Tanzania, and almost 1 in 3 adults in Brazil. With Be. it's possible to deliver a professional clean, even without infrastructure like an electric grid.  From coast to coast, we've all witnessed or experienced the devastation of our changing climate. Doing our part to help take care of our planet is an important mission for Goodwell Co., and the products we make signify our dedication to our sustainability initiative. With electricity as a non-issue, the goal is to ultimately provide a small step towards maximizing relief efforts.            
Goodwell + Co. was started 3 years ago with the goal of creating sustainable toothbrushes and oral hygiene products. Our absolute favorite brand on the planet is Patagonia, and we are forever inspired and motivated by the vision of Yvon Chouinard. Following in that vision, Goodwell has made the promise to ourselves and our customers to always make the very best products in the most ethical and environmentally conscious way. 

To date, we’ve sold 1 million premium manual and 100% recyclable toothbrushes. We’re also proud to offer all natural Pacific Mint toothpaste with compostable packaging, and GoodFloss, our 100% biodegradable flossers. 

We believe that sustainability is not only what your products are made of, but also how they are made, and how long they last. Our promise to you is a lifetime of using Be. We built this brush so that it can be worked on if anything ever goes wrong. Send your Be. back if it’s not brushing at its best and we’ll repair it or replace it for free.

<p>Many consumers gave us various answers to this question.</p>

<p>In reality, foot care is cumbersome to do at home and was extremely difficult for people who are clumsy in using tools.</p>
<p>The painful experiences of getting a cut on the skin by the sharp foot file or the inconveniences of having to take a foot bath to soak the dead cells in as well as unsatisfying results have led people to less prefer foot care.</p>

<p>You don’t necessarily have to apply pressure with a sharp surface to effectively remove the dead skin cells on your feet.</p>
<p>Sharp foot files actually carve out the surface of your skin. This causes wounds on your skin that can develop into more severe disorders such as skin damage, tetanus, etc. Generally, these tools are sharp because they are made out of stainless steel. They are also extremely dangerous because they can make your skin bleed if used in a wrong way. Moreover, they even cause a reverse effect to make your skin layers even thicker than they were before exfoliating them.</p>

<p>The existing standard foot files usually require you to soak your feet in the water first to gently and effectively remove the dead skin cells. However, you at least need to spend around 20-30 minutes for the process of turning on the tap water, soaking your feet, and waiting for the dead skin cells to soften. Then you also have to scrub your feet, which might take up a total of 1 hour for the entire process.</p>
<p>But aren’t you tired of always waiting for your feet skin to soften in water every time you have to exfoliate them?</p>

<p>One of the most important characteristics of TOOLA is that it can be managed hygienically by rinsing it off with water.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604470303/zhl69whgfiderk5di6xa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The existing standard foot files have drawbacks when it comes to managing them. They may cut your hands when you wash them and the remains of the dead skin cells stay on them even when you rinse them with water.</p>
<p>Foot files that cannot be washed thoroughly are not only unhygienic, but also dangerous for your skin. The unsanitary environment makes it easier for bacteria to propagate, which increases your chance of developing bacterial skin infection.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/030/650/854/910edfb432e117ba9a8fd4f6430db70c_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1600416706&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=237d522d24b985f6485f29d9e30d039d"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Therefore, we took a different approach. As you may already know, TOOLA is made out of 100% glass material, which allows all dead skin cells to rinse away with water.</p>

</div></div>","""The extraordinary feet cosmetics, TOOLA""
Your socks and shoes suffocate your feet for the whole day. If you don’t take care of your feet even for a little bit, they often become dry, form dead skin cells, and can even smell.

However, many people are negligent in taking care of their feet even though they have to walk around withstanding their weight every day. We take care of our faces on a daily basis, but not our feet as much.
Why do you think that is?
Many consumers gave us various answers to this question.


In reality, foot care is cumbersome to do at home and was extremely difficult for people who are clumsy in using tools.
The painful experiences of getting a cut on the skin by the sharp foot file or the inconveniences of having to take a foot bath to soak the dead cells in as well as unsatisfying results have led people to less prefer foot care.
Consequently, we prepared ‘TOOLA’, a total foot care beauty item that can resolve all these problems at once. You can easily take care of your feet by immediately using it on your dry feet for just 1 minute a day.
It’s a product that will help you get rid of all your feet problems such as dryness, smell, fungal infection, etc.
 

 

The Perfect Foot Care Solution, TOOLA!
TOOLA is a home-use foot care file that is made of 100% glass.
The embedded glass etching technique is used to protect the skin and effectively remove dry-skin. It is also hygienic and easy to wash.

Enjoy Your Foot Care!
Caring for your feet can now be done easily at home. In only a minute, you can experience your own salon shop with your feet feeling fresh!
 


TOOLA is a hypoallergenic foot exfoliator that has been made through the glass-etching patented technology. Thus, people with sensitive skin can also use TOOLA.
TOOLA removes the dead skin cells without damaging your skin. The semiconductor technique has been integrated on glass to create nano patterns with tiny bumps on the contact surface. The ‘irritation-free glass-etching patented technology’ is TOOLA’s exclusive technology that protects the skin while removing the dead skin cells.  

Wait a minute, Do you think TOOLA will be less effective because it is gentle and hypoallergenic?
Well, that’s simply not true.

You don’t necessarily have to apply pressure with a sharp surface to effectively remove the dead skin cells on your feet.
Sharp foot files actually carve out the surface of your skin. This causes wounds on your skin that can develop into more severe disorders such as skin damage, tetanus, etc. Generally, these tools are sharp because they are made out of stainless steel. They are also extremely dangerous because they can make your skin bleed if used in a wrong way. Moreover, they even cause a reverse effect to make your skin layers even thicker than they were before exfoliating them.

TOOLA is a foot file born from a new concept which eliminates all the disadvantages of existing ones.
Unlike other foot files that use stainless steel, TOOLA uses the glass material made out of glass-etching technology, which effectively removes all the dead skin cells without irritating the skin.  

The glass-etching technology creates flat top surfaces on the tiny bumps that form the glass pattern, which reduces skin irritation. Also, the body parts of the bumps have been manufactured in the curvature form with an appropriate angle to effectively exfoliate the dead skin cells. These chemically processed glass bumps are effective because they can penetrate into the dead skin cells based on their angle.

They are also in the cylindrical shape, which allows the dead skin cells to be cleansed away easily.

 
We have carried out a test with kiwis, and the difference of the exfoliating effect between the standard foot file and the TOOLA glass was evident through the outcomes as shown below.

Problems with standard foot file is that it damages unwanted skin layers, however, with the glass foot file, it only effectively and safely removes dry-skin and dead skin cells.
 

Unlike the standard foot file that only has one type of function, TOOLA provides 2-in-1 foot care with two functions that you can use based on your feet condition.

The STEP 1 surface of TOOLA removes the hard dead skin cells that are stuck in between your skin. The STEP 2 surface effectively exfoliates the soft dead skin cells that are spread all over the epidermis of your skin.

The total care that TOOLA provides through two steps allows your feet to feel more revitalized. It not only delicately exfoliates the old dead skin cells that are stuck in between the skin of your soles, heels, and the sides of your feet, but also removes the dead skin cells that lie on the surface of your skin.

As long as you dedicate yourself to using TOOLA consistently, you can always clean and rejuvenate your skin even if you have calluses and old dead skin cells that are tough to get rid of.
 

You don’t need to soak your feet wet to use TOOLA. Just use it for ‘1 minute’.

The existing standard foot files usually require you to soak your feet in the water first to gently and effectively remove the dead skin cells. However, you at least need to spend around 20-30 minutes for the process of turning on the tap water, soaking your feet, and waiting for the dead skin cells to soften. Then you also have to scrub your feet, which might take up a total of 1 hour for the entire process.
But aren’t you tired of always waiting for your feet skin to soften in water every time you have to exfoliate them?


If so, TOOLA is the solution for you. We implemented all the necessary technology into TOOLA to allow you to gently and effectively exfoliate your feet in its dry state. You no longer have to waste your time soaking them in water.
 

 


One of the most important characteristics of TOOLA is that it can be managed hygienically by rinsing it off with water.

The existing standard foot files have drawbacks when it comes to managing them. They may cut your hands when you wash them and the remains of the dead skin cells stay on them even when you rinse them with water.
Foot files that cannot be washed thoroughly are not only unhygienic, but also dangerous for your skin. The unsanitary environment makes it easier for bacteria to propagate, which increases your chance of developing bacterial skin infection.

 
Therefore, we took a different approach. As you may already know, TOOLA is made out of 100% glass material, which allows all dead skin cells to rinse away with water.
Moreover, TOOLA is different from cheap glass that breaks easily. It is a safe product that is made out of selected premium glass that has passed the test which detects 26 toxic substances and also completed the safety standard test. 
 

 

TOOLA is very light and compact. It is light enough to take it to your travel destinations and business trips. TOOLA boasts an elegant design as a transparent glass that is charming enough to display it as an interior product in the house.

It is not only compact, but also has excellent grip. As it is a 115 x 45 rectangular glass, it has high quality grip and excellent portability that allow you to comfortably hold on to it while removing the dead skin cells.
 

 

Scrub your dry sole with the STEP 1 surface. This step allows you to file the hardened dead skin cells stuck in between your skin. Exfoliate sufficiently until your sole becomes covered in white flakes of dead skin cells.
 

Now, gently scrub your sole with the STEP 2 surface for 10~20 seconds. This step allows you to exfoliate the stratum corneum that is blocking the entire skin surface and also clear away the fine dead skin cells that have been raised on the surface. It lightens and smooths your skin.
 

Keep your TOOLA GLASS clean by running some water over it for a few seconds. The dry the TOOLA GLASS after rinsing off the dead skin cells with the running water.
 


 

 

It was essential for TOOLA to have a definite point of differentiation compared to other beauty products in the existing market as it presented ‘innovative beauty’ as its slogan.In the process of developing TOOLA, we decided to use 100% glass material and applied a different exfoliating method in contrast to other existing foot files. Producing TOOLA through the hypoallergenic glass-etching technology upgraded the product effectiveness and also eliminated any factors that cause skin irritation.
‘TOOLA’ is a safe, high performance, and elegantly designed product that fulfills consumers’ needs and promotes innovative beauty.

All this with a tiny, comfortable next level Active Noise-Cancelling.Make a decision for better sleep, a fabulous start into the day and a healthier life. Finally, after a refreshing night you can look at yourself in the mirror, smile and see the absence of dark eyeshades, feel ready for the daily tasks and be confident that the next night's sleep is going to be just as tranquil as the previous one. Let us introduce you to a very special, extra tiny and super comfortable solution – QuietOn 3.  The oasis of tranquility is achieved through QuietOn's top-notch Active Noise Cancelling technology: First, the noise coming to your ear is sampled and then attenuated with opposing soundwaves, resulting in a calming quietness. In this context, no additional sound is audible that masks the original sound, allowing you to enjoy pleasant and soothing quietude instead.The noise reduction capabilities of QuietOn 3 excel particularly in the range of low frequencies, when compared to foam earplugs. This is clearly shown in the graph below. Note the deep dive within the 200-500Hz area. In this range, where the loudest part of the snoring is usually expected to happen, QuietOn 3 Active Noise Cancelling doubles the noise reduction.The performance of QuietOn 3 Active Noise Cancelling earbuds compared to that of conventional foam earplugs is visualized in the graph below.  So, put those foam earplugs aside, QuietOn 3 in your ear, and sleep calmly next to your loved one once again - this might prevent the one or other relationship quarrel about a shared bed(room).What especially sets QuietOn 3 apart from the other devices out there is the size – yes, in your ear it does matter! These earbuds are the world’s smallest ANC devices. They are designed to take you to a Nordic oasis of tranquility even in the most difficult noise circumstances. Ergonomically designed so you won’t even notice them, you’ll sleep away like a proverbial princess or prince or whoever you want to be! ""QuietOn has impacted my life and wellbeing positively and I would recommend these devices to anyone who has trouble sleeping.""

 
QuietOn 3 is designed for perfection: QuietOn 3 excels with its market-leading noise cancelling performance, smallest possible size and best fit for the ear anatomy.The outstanding nature of the world’s smallest Active Noise Cancelling earbuds does not end there: Our design team has spent countless hours to perfect the device, such as the user experience, the design and performance.The product is removed from the charging box and can be used immediately. No buttons or set up needed. When you put them back inside the case, the charging happens automatically.Given their long battery life, the earbuds can be used without having to worry about recharging - or waking up at night unexpectedly to your partner’s snoring. Just remember to charge the case battery once per week. Since its early days, the inspiration for QuietOn has lied in a tranquil Nordic soundscape both technically and aesthetically. The design and materials are made without compromises, aiming to provide the feeling of quietude and tranquility to everyone in need. To ensure the best possible user experience, as well as to indicate the battery life when the charging case is opened or closed, we are using real stainless steel and embedding light guides.

This is achieved by great design work as well as outstanding quality control in the manufacturing, such as tight audio and battery tests.For a normal sized adult's outer ear, the shell of the earbud typically fits inside the concha, between the crus of helix and the antitragus. Because of this position and the slimness of the earbud, side sleepers don’t feel the pressure.Another important feature is how the shape of QuietOn 3 is designed to reach the ear canal without stretching the tragus.The width of the ear canal varies from person to person.

</ul></div>","Bunshi Lab makes it worth while.Based on our philosophy,the idea of creating a beautiful and high quality face mask for the new era was born.Bunshi Lab introduces ‘Bunshi Mask',a mask created from the Japanese spirit of hospitality and craftsmanship. Bunshi Mask maintains a sleek and stylish design with optimal protection. Bunshi Mask is made from environmentally friendly materials and uses the finest cotton knit fabric. A mask developed for comfort and peace of mind. Bunshi Lab believes in using sustainable and organic materials that are friendly to the people and environment. New normal, new standard.A new era mask that combines a beautiful minimalist design with high performance.  6 Features of 'Bunshi Mask' Mask performance is required to be higher than ever, which is why ‘Bunshi Mask’ is equipped with the latest nanofiber filters developed in Tokyo. 
The nanofiber filter invented by Prof Tanioka (emeritus professor) in Tokyo Institute of Technology, catches more than 99% of fine particles (of 100 nanometers) according to the quality test conducted by KAKEN TEST CENTER General Incorporated Foundation.​
It uses the latest nanofiber filter leveraging “van der Waals’ force” acts. Since Bunshi Mask adopted finer mesh for its filter, “van der Waals’ force” could be stronger and catch fine particles effectively.The inventor of 'Bunshi Mask' is Emeritus Professor Tanioka of Tokyo Institute of Technology (TIT).TIT is one of the top Universities in Japan (often referred to as the ""MIT of Japan"").Professor Tanioka has made a lot of efforts to research and develop the nanofiber filter for many years and is one of the leading authorites in this field.He is currently a chairman of the Nanofiber Society (a non-profitable organization) in Japan and internationally recognized.  'Bunshi Mask’ allows you to breath with ease in comparison to other types of masks. *Pressure loss of Bunshi Mask was tested by KURASHI KAGAKU LABORATORY co.,ltd.Breath twice as easily compared to non-woven masks.8x easier to breathe than the N95 mask. With other masks, the stronger filters in place create a strain on your breathing.However, Bunshi Mask has found the solution to maintain protective power and comfort for breathing. 'Bunshi Mask' is washable and reusable. The ability to catch fine particles stays at the same level even after 100 times of laundry. It is wrinkle-resistant and keeps its protective power even after *repeated laundry.A great solution for sustainability (made from cotton and recycled PET nanofibers)​*Thin nanofiber was used for the quality test in order to recognize tiny changes in the numbers.  'Bunshi Mask' is made by mercerized high-quality cotton (NOT XINJIANG COTTON​).​Organic, fine-knit cotton fabric (NOT XINJIANG COTTON​)​ creates a comfortable fit.Designed to prevent moisture retention and be gentle on sensitive skin (including children).  The well thought-out design was created to flatter all face types. The inner lining cotton is colored beige, to prevent makeup stains from standing out.  ‘Bunshi Mask’ offers various colors to choose from. 5 colors (white, gray, beige, pink, black)Four sizes (XL, L, M, S/kids) to fit you best How to choose your best size
*Reference if you do not have a measuring tape available:Measure with 2 credit cards (sideways) aligned vertically, approximately 11 cm (4.3 inches). If your measurements are larger than the 2 credit cards (sideways), the best fit will be L, and M if the measurements are about the same.  More about MaterialsThe main body of Bunshi Mask is 100% organic cotton. Nanofiber filter (inside) is made from PET resin, recycled from plastic bottles and adjusters are made from polycarbonate resin (plastic). Knit fabric is used for the ear bands. There is no space between the ear band and piping line so that you can have an optimal fit and get rid of ear pain.  Who Are We?We are ""Bunshi Lab""Our mission is to deliver high-quality items to everyone,from people with sensitive skin conditions to those who value functionality and design.  Already Popular in JapanBunshi Mask has already been used by many people in Japan.Bunshi Lab launched the first crowd-funding campaign for Bunshi Mask in Japan last year.

<p>On the second day, at around 6 pm, I took a picture from the top of Lee Hwa Ryeong. On the way down after taking a picture, I fell into a gap in the road. Fortunately, my bones were not broken, so I continued riding my bicycle down to the village, and after receiving treatment at the emergency room of a general hospital 40 km away, I headed to the hotel.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was no pain in the hip, so I rode a bicycle to Busan.</p>

<p> My passion for the saddle has been around for a long time. Saddle pain was considered a pain to overcome, so I sat down on the saddle every few days and tried to get used to it. However, after learning that saddle pain is not only temporary pain, it can cause a variety of complications,</p>
<p>I started my research.</p> <p> I was trained in the IP Creation Zone of the Intellectual Property Center, and acquired knowledge little by little by going to various exhibitions and training centers. Although technically inadequate, as I worked hard for a saddle without pain, thankfully, there were people who supported me and improved the product little by little with experts in this field. There are hobbyists who can tell us the reviews, so we were able to improve each step.</p>

The sciatic nodule is the protruding part of the area where the hip and saddle meet. This is the area where you feel a lot of pain when riding a bicycle. If you continue riding the bike, the pain from the saddle may be relieved.
It's not usually a big problem, but some people feel saddle pain a lot.
 
 
 2. Pain caused by compression of the pudendal nerve 
 
Often known as “Prostate Pain”. However, the prostate is located in front of the bladder and is not pressed directly. The pudendal nerve, which is not normally subject to pressure, is pressed against the saddle, supporting the weight of the body. When riding, about 3cm of the perineum is pressed by the saddle.
 
 
If left unattended while riding for a long time, it may cause chronic pain such as impotence, inability, and urination disorders, which may lead to hospitalization.
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

Pain area: The area that is pressed and feels pain when riding
 
HUAN PPS saddle is designed to wrap around the pelvis to maintain the correct posture throughout the ride and prevents the sciatic nodule (the area where the bone protrudes from the hip which is often called as “Sit Bones”) and the pudendal nerves from being compressed.
 
 

Design considering sciatic nodule as well as pudendal(genital) nerve 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 


 
Urethane material high-density foam is used to support the perineum and pelvis with a small area.
 
 

 Urethane, which changes according to the weight placed on the saddle, enables comfortable riding.
 
 
The slope of the cushion is designed to be more flatten and wide so that there is no part that feels pressed due to the sudden change in height during riding, and the cushion covers the hip so that it is comfortable for long riding.

I biked 577 km from Chuncheon to Busan. I ran 7 hours/day at 20 km/hour for 5 days and 4 nights with my friend.
On the second day, at around 6 pm, I took a picture from the top of Lee Hwa Ryeong. On the way down after taking a picture, I fell into a gap in the road. Fortunately, my bones were not broken, so I continued riding my bicycle down to the village, and after receiving treatment at the emergency room of a general hospital 40 km away, I headed to the hotel.
Should I go to Busan? I was frustrated and couldn't sleep. Fortunately, I thought I could go to Busan because there was no difficulty in getting up and running the next day.
If I had pain in my hip, I would have given up going to Busan on the pretext of being injured.
Fortunately, there was no pain in the hip, so I rode a bicycle to Busan.
After finishing my bike ride to Busan, I was very happy. Not only the joy of completing the race even after getting hurt, the development of a pain-free saddle and the idea that many people can enjoy cycling without pain in the future made me even more delighted.
 
 

 
 I won't stop. 
With your enthusiasm and donations, we will be able to apply not only new saddle products in 2022 but also another product that can improve the sitting experience.
Further researches and developments, I can contribute to a society that reduces air pollution and improves people's health.
I and HUAN will do our best to make it. We look forward to your continued support. Thank you.
 
 
 
 


 My passion for the saddle has been around for a long time. Saddle pain was considered a pain to overcome, so I sat down on the saddle every few days and tried to get used to it. However, after learning that saddle pain is not only temporary pain, it can cause a variety of complications,
I started my research.  I was trained in the IP Creation Zone of the Intellectual Property Center, and acquired knowledge little by little by going to various exhibitions and training centers. Although technically inadequate, as I worked hard for a saddle without pain, thankfully, there were people who supported me and improved the product little by little with experts in this field. There are hobbyists who can tell us the reviews, so we were able to improve each step.
 
 

 We are a small start-up company of riding-loving hobbyists, but we are very proud of our passion and technology.
It is our dream to enable riders to enjoy riding without any more painful experiences.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Get ready to upgrade your In-home pedicure treatment! </p>
<p>Before <i>PediCurve Solar</i>, most in-home pedicure devices were based on roller technology.</p>
<p>These old school pedicure devices were cheaply made sandpaper rolls, or some other form of rough composite material.</p>
<p><strong>Sandpaper rollers are unhealthy and wasteful.</strong> They rip and scrape your skin, causing friction and heat which will damage your feet. Even worse, they wear out quickly and need to be thrown away. You’ll then need to replace and continue spending money. It’s terrible for your skin, and for the environment.</p>
<p>As for composite rollers, this technology is a bit better, but also induces friction/heat and are wearing down fast, making them in-efficient and very expensive in the long run both with replacing batteries and buying new rollers.</p>
<p>We decided to innovate and solve this problem once and for all!</p>
<p><strong>PediCurve Solar is the best in-home pedicure device on the planet.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gentle on your skin</li>
<li>Use it in the shower on softer skin</li>
<li>Solar powered, no need for batteries</li>
<li>Hygienic and efficient with patented PediGlass discs</li>
<li>Reduces waste and lower cost of ownership compared to disposables</li>
<li>No batteries, no cables, no chargers, no adapters</li>
<li>Loved by men and women alike!</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes this possible?</p>
<p>We use a patented <i>PediGlass Disc</i>, along with solar power. When using this product in the shower (or bath), your skin becomes softer and it’s much easier to remove hard, calloused skin. PediCurve Solar is gentle, hygienic and efficient. </p>
<p>Our <i>PediGlass Discs</i> are chemically etched with craters on the glass which easily removes softened skin and leaves your feet feeling soft and smooth. No abrasion, no pain or discomfort like the old school disposable products you’ve used in the past.</p>
<p><strong>**UPDATE** - We’re getting PediCurve Solar certified as a medical device!</strong></p>
<p>Our application will be based on preliminary data obtained with our previous pedicure device. Although we obtained this data some time ago, unfortunately this data wasn’t validated and so we’ll need to start with new benchmark data. Our original data was very promising, especially towards diabetics. We’re excited to continue this process, albeit it is long and costly, while these clinical tests will objectively show just how good and innovative PediCurve Solar really is:-) </p>
<p>Please remember, currently <i>PediCurve Solar</i> is NOT certified as a Medical Device but we’re working very hard to achieve this certification.</p>

<div><p><i><strong>The forgotten vital sign</strong></i></p></div>
</div><p>Body temperature is one of the four vitals signs to monitor, along with blood pressure, heart rate and sugar level. However, it is often forgotten. People tend to only take their temperature when they are ill, which can be too late.</p><p><strong><i>""but not a lot of people in this world right now know what their normal body temperature is or how much it varies normally,"" said Dr. Waleed Javaid, the director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York state (<a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/07/health/normal-body-temperature-covid-wellness/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CNN</a>).</i></strong></p><p><i><strong>Why body temperature is important</strong></i></p><p>Our body temperature reveals a lot of information about our health, such as providing insights into hormonal health. Knowing our body temperature can also assist us with training and recovery decisions.</p><p>Measuring body temperature is also very important in medicine. A number of diseases are characterized by a change in body temperature. For example, a persistent fever is a possible symptom for blood cancer. </p><p>With other illnesses, the course of the disease can be followed by measuring body temperature. This allows the doctor to analyze the effectiveness of treatments based on body temperatures.</p><p>There are also diseases with known fever patterns, such as dengue and zika. By understanding our body temperature and being able to compare our abnormal temperature trends to those illnesses’, it can help us realize health issues before it’s too late.</p><p><i><strong>Temperature measurements vs Temperature trend</strong></i></p><p>In most cases, body temperature trends are more significant than individual measurements. Temperature curves with measured values taken in close sequence can best be compared by a doctor. These, together with other clinical observations, can help provide secure diagnoses.</p><p><i><strong>How Trace-Temp1 and Trace-TempAI App can help</strong></i></p><p>Temperature monitoring should be done consistently throughout the day so that accurate temperature trends can be formed. Trace-Temp1 is thus created to be accurate and portable while Trace-TempAI app is compatible across devices so that you can monitor your temperature on the go.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://igg.me/at/trace-temp1/x/25377930#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616122948/qevkhlh1q4mlmtwyy468.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><i><strong>Additional Links:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong><a href=""http://medium.com/@bkp_tsmart/covid-19-importance-of-fever-detection-a-t-smart-perspective-5e41ded95f7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Discover T-SMART's perspective about the importance of fever detection during COVID-19</a>.</strong></li></ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><a href=""http://medium.com/@bkp_tsmart/covid-19-importance-of-fever-detection-a-t-smart-perspective-5e41ded95f7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616123177/bie86ddckpitkglkmwpw.png"" src=""""/></a></strong></p><ul><li><strong><a href=""https://medium.com/@bkp_tsmart/re-thinking-the-way-we-live-post-covid-19-31ce8bb29979"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Look forward and rethink the way we live post COVID-19.</a></strong></li></ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://medium.com/@bkp_tsmart/re-thinking-the-way-we-live-post-covid-19-31ce8bb29979"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616123316/uqbnwflqwcqql6o4dq58.png"" src=""""/></a></p><ul><li><strong><a href=""https://medium.com/@bkp_tsmart/live-long-and-prosper-with-love-and-logic-during-covid-19-a7734393533d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read what T-SMART founder realised during the COVID-19 pandemic.</a></strong></li></ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><a href=""https://medium.com/@bkp_tsmart/live-long-and-prosper-with-love-and-logic-during-covid-19-a7734393533d"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616123461/pezma8jftjwwpu8o3py5.png"" src=""""/></a></strong></p><ul><li>

The forgotten vital sign
Body temperature is one of the four vitals signs to monitor, along with blood pressure, heart rate and sugar level. However, it is often forgotten. People tend to only take their temperature when they are ill, which can be too late.""but not a lot of people in this world right now know what their normal body temperature is or how much it varies normally,"" said Dr. Waleed Javaid, the director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York state (CNN).Why body temperature is importantOur body temperature reveals a lot of information about our health, such as providing insights into hormonal health. Knowing our body temperature can also assist us with training and recovery decisions.Measuring body temperature is also very important in medicine. A number of diseases are characterized by a change in body temperature. For example, a persistent fever is a possible symptom for blood cancer. With other illnesses, the course of the disease can be followed by measuring body temperature. This allows the doctor to analyze the effectiveness of treatments based on body temperatures.There are also diseases with known fever patterns, such as dengue and zika. By understanding our body temperature and being able to compare our abnormal temperature trends to those illnesses’, it can help us realize health issues before it’s too late.Temperature measurements vs Temperature trendIn most cases, body temperature trends are more significant than individual measurements. Temperature curves with measured values taken in close sequence can best be compared by a doctor. These, together with other clinical observations, can help provide secure diagnoses.How Trace-Temp1 and Trace-TempAI App can helpTemperature monitoring should be done consistently throughout the day so that accurate temperature trends can be formed. Trace-Temp1 is thus created to be accurate and portable while Trace-TempAI app is compatible across devices so that you can monitor your temperature on the go. Additional Links:Discover T-SMART's perspective about the importance of fever detection during COVID-19.Look forward and rethink the way we live post COVID-19.Read what T-SMART founder realised during the COVID-19 pandemic.

</div></div>","The SPOTU wearable device contains powerful technology and high-end mechanics uniquely specialized for indoor exercises.
We have two options available for you - The SPOTU Lite and SPOTU Pro. Here are the differences below...
 


Collect data anywhere, any time.
One of the most distinctive features of the SPOTU Pro is the vital signs monitoring system. Users can exercise smartly by keeping track of  their respiration, body temperature, and heart rate - all with one device.
1. Respiration monitoring
Consistent breathing is important for any workout from Crossfit to Yoga. Spotu monitors your breathing so that you can stay on track and even avoid injury from breathing imbalances.
2. Body temperature monitoring
Many studies have shown that athletic performance is closely related to body temperature. During exercise, the heating of your  body increases fatigue, which can affect your workout. Spotu tracks your body temperature so you can operate at peak performance.
3. Heart Rate Monitor
SPOTU uses an ECG-type heart rate sensor -  the most accurate sensor available, traditionally used for medical purposes. Keep track of your heart rate in real time so you make sure you’re reaching your goals and making your workout as efficient as possible. 
 
SPOTU Lite is designed to separate the head unit device from the band. So you can easily wash the band individually. It is also compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry.
The same motion and heart rate sensor with SPOTU Pro are applied to SPOTU Lite, and it is suitable for at-home fitness, bodyweight, and HIIT as well.
 
Press the button on the center of the device for 2-3 seconds to turn on the device. When it is on, there will be vibration feedback and the LED circle lamp will blink. On your smartphone or tablet, enable the Bluetooth network, and run the SPOTU mobile application. Follow the instructions on the app to sign up or log in. Then connect it to the device after the device registration on the Profile tab. 

Now, you can start your workout with SPOTU! While you exercise, SPOTU will monitor and record your workout data in real-time.   SPOTU is a wearable fitness device that has been developed and optimized for routine-based indoor exercises, such as gym workouts. It accurately monitors physical condition through the advanced wearable device and provides workout performance insights and solutions for more effective self-coaching, exercise ability improvement, and injury prevention based on a variety of data.Existing smart devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers rely heavily on GPS technology for tracking workout activities.  
While these devices are designed for outdoor exercises such as running and cycling, they face many limitations when it comes to indoor exercises where posture and rep counting are more important.
They also normally use PPG optical sensors for heart rate measuring, which have accuracy problems during intense exercises such as weight training, high-intensity interval training, etc.
 

SPOTU analyzes the YouTube videos that are most popular in the at-home fitness category as well as the YouTube channels that you’ve already subscribed to and displays them in the app for easy reference. 
 SPOTU also extracts workout details from the videos and saves them into the database, so you can view those details in the SPOTU app without having to watch the videos themselves.
Easily search for workouts that you want to do using keywords, as well as get workout recommendations for your fitness level - all from the SPOTU app.
 

SPOTU offers Real-time Performance Monitoring and Augmented Video Recording features so you can coach yourself while you're working out. This means you can see where you need to improve and correct your form before it becomes a habit or you potentially hurt yourself.

While you're working out, you'll also see information on the video itself such as:

Movement names
Workout time
Reps
Total reps 
RPM (reps per minute) 
HR bpm
Body temperature

 
You can also check out the recorded videos for much more detailed indicators after your workout.

 
The straightforward user interface of SPOTU makes it easy and convenient to check motion speed, pace, and movement consistency so that you can have important training feedback even if you are not a fitness expert.
 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 

During your workout, SPOTU allows you to check your heart rate level via an LED lamp on the device. The ECG type Heart Rate Sensor in the device maintains accurate HR measurement even during intense workouts.
 
Each color on your LED light represents a different heart rate level, so you know your current physical status immediately. That's important information that will help you adjust your pace for more effective athletic growth, as well as reducing the risk of injury.

 
 

SPOTU is the height of technology, wrapping comfortably around your chest and maximizing the accuracy of the biometric data by utilizing an ECG-type heart rate sensor, respiration sensor, and noise-minimized motion tracking technology. 
 
Also, the SPOTU Motion Judging Engine (an in-house developed core technology) identifies and distinguishes user movements and counts repetitions of movements accurately and in real-time.

 
Among the various types of data that SPOTU collects are linear acceleration and quaternion, both types of motion data that show patterns and features when specific movements are repeated. The SPOTU Motion Judging Engine uses a deep learning method, which makes for more accurate data and better overall performance.
Currently, SPOTU can recognize the composition and repetition counts of exercises like:

Jumping jacks
Burpees
High knees
Air squats 
Planks
Sit ups
Push-ups
And more...

The SPOTU team plans to include more than 100 exercise movements in the device from bodyweight exercises to weightlifting to gymnastics before the product is shipped.

On the SPOTU PRO spec basis, there are 4 types of sensors (ECG type heart rate, respiration, motion tracking, and temperature sensors) included in the device to collect biometric and motion data in real-time.
The respiratory measurement sensor has applied advanced smart textile technologies based on the nano carbon coating of the MCELL (US patent 16/081,875). Unlike other wrist strap type devices, SPOTU is a chest strap type device.
We chose the chest strap style because the chest is the most ideal part of human body to collect motion and biometric data.
