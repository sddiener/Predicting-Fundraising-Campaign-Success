<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Christopher Bernal and I am the Chief Operations Officer here at LaciLou, LLC. I started this company with the CEO Deborah Bello. Together we have come up with a great line of children's clothing and accessories. I have served in the US Military since 2000 with distinction and have deployed multiple times. I hold multiple degrees in Security and Project Management. The CEO has worked in finance and handled accounts for some of biggest multi-million dollar companies in the USA for the past 30 years.</li>
<li>Our campaign is important to us because we give back to the community all these companies say that they will donate socks, materials and money but does the average consumer ever see this happen. NO, plain and simple nobody ever sees this happening. We guarantee that everyone will have the chance to see where the money will be going. We will be a 100% made in the USA company and be 100% transparent.  We will donate 25 cents of every purchase to the Wounded Warriors Project and 25 cents to the Anti-Bullying Campaign. At the end of the year we will hold a party and not just any party but a Donation campaign party we will present one check to each of the campaigns. We will stream it live on Facebook and on our website for everyone to see that some of the money they have used to purchase products have gone to campaigns to help children and our veterans.</li>
<li>Contributors will help launch a top of the line specialized Children's clothing company that is geared towards the child and to help support the child's independence and uniqueness. All while helping two great causes that hopefully will change America and then the world. As a company we have big dreams but our goal is to help goals of the children blossom through their clothing. If a child can dream it we can produce it. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With all the recent bullying that is going on in school that is making the news imagine what is not making the news. Every child needs to feel safe in school and we aim to help provide that not only in monetary compensation to the Anti-Bullying Campaign but some one of our sock lines will have inspirational words on them and slogans. Our goal as a company is to provide the best moment forward that we can to protect our children and as parents we should strive to make school, playgrounds and communities as safe as possible for a brighter tomorrow. Children should never be afraid to go on social media or school because of bullying we need to put a stop to it and ""ROCK YOUR SOCKS"".</p>
<p>The Wounded Warriors Project is something that is near and dear to my heart with so many of my brothers wounded in action or dealing with psychological issues are left untreated or not recieving the proper treatment and need help. Anything I can do to help our veterans get back to health and have some resemblance of a normal life I will do. Back in 2003 America was not ready for what war would do to our service members and did not have th care in place to help our service members. Fast forward to 2019 we have come a long way but still havent got to where we need to be, one suicide or one death of a service member due to lack of treatment is one too many. As a company we will do everything we can to help our veterans either by providing a job, shelter, clothes or money and that's our goal. </p>
<p><strong>THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE</strong> with our company is that we will be 100% Transparent you will be able to see where your money is going not only from the end of year presentation to the campaigns that you will be invited to in person or it being Streamed live on Facebook and our website. But you will see a difference in Anti-Bullying and Wounded Warriors Project because along with our product our advertising will be geared towards these two campaigns as well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Biggest risks we are taking is everything we have and own is going into this business to provide the consumer with a product that is not cheaply made or thrown together and will last. People need to get their money's worth out of a product today and we just aren't usually able to do that. So many companies are taking shortcuts and not providing the proper customer service and we are sick and tired of it. People value your transparency and a company that cares and that is why we create LaciLou for just that reason to provide parents with a great product and something children will love to wear.  We have already overcome some hurdles by finding a clothing manufacturer here in the USA that will produce all of our materials just for us and the LaciLou clothing line.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul><li>If you can't help us out with a monetary contribution please help us out with word of mouth and the Indiegogo share tools. The best advertisement is word of mouth and to spread the word of the company would mean just as much to us as money would. <strong>Make some noise about our campaign. By ourselves we can't be heard but as a group we our loud and proud spread the word and remember to say ""ROCK YOUR SOCKS"".</strong>

designer brands since 2012. People want top-quality designer briefcases without the huge price tags. With this project, I was able to make a premium briefcase at a fraction of the price of other luxury brands.This briefcase is made by a luxury brand manufacturer and with its built-in 15” laptop compartment there will never be a more stylish way to bring your laptop with you for business or leisure.       Higher Quality and Reasonable PriceThe high prices for these products are often due to brand markup and high costs of marketing and distribution. By connecting manufacturers and consumers directly through Indiegogo, we have achieved huge savings which we can pass on to you. Using crowdfunding pre-orders and mass production, we can offer a saving of 80% compared to similar luxury brand bags. Choose the Color               HOW IS IT MADE?The Best Quality in the WorldWe collaborated with a company that has created world-class luxury bags for clients all over the world, including Prada, Chloe and Paul Smith amongst many others. The manufacturer in Spain has six factories and 700 employees, and has been producing luxury brand products since the 1940s.      In making our bags, highly-skilled artisans take care over every stage of the process. Over 200 manual steps are required to make the perfect product.   European Full Grain Natural Leather Luxurious bags start with luxurious materials. We use high quality cowhide leather with minimal processing utilizing the beautiful patterns of natural leather surfaces.  This leather is soft to the touch, not easily deformed, and easy to care for.   It is also produced in an environmentally friendly way, minimizing environmental pollution. Although the world is gradually shifting away from meat consumption towards vegetarianism and veganism, the meat industry continues to produce a huge amount of cow leather that if not used is simply discarded.  Less but BetterIts basic design ensures that the leather's luxury stands out. Minimalist with essential features and a modern classic form for a lifetime of use. It has a design that goes well with formal wear and casual looks. DETAIL   Lightweight bag – 850g   Features
15” laptop compartment (perfect for Apple Macbook Pro), with a sturdy separate reinforcement
Zipper pocket
Two open pockets
Shoulder strap
Name tag (card holder)
High quality YKK zipper
Oxford cotton lining (extremely durable)
  Multi Pocket     Notebook pocket, zipper pocket and two open pockets make it easy to use even and a surprisingly large capacity. Durable Subsidiary Materials  Oxford Cotton Lining  Glued by Hand!Craftsmen work on the gluing with their bare hands while attaching leather. The powerful and environmentally friendly bonding materials are totally safe even for workers over long periods.                      We provide a shoulder strap for long-lasting comfort and and a leather-made name tag.  Quality Control TeamA team of highly-trained professionals inspect every bag before delivery meaning no bag will leave the shop unless it is perfect.  Package                                 Shipped in dust bags complete with a  warranty card.   Schedule         Look Book                  Thanks a lot.Contact us : mustneedsofficial@gmail.com www.mustneeds.com",51.0,1,"1 Campaign

They flew from Boston, USA, to southern Wales, United Kingdom. Having spent 20 hours and 40 minutes and experienced various bad weather conditions such as blizzard, the plane finally landed successfully in Barry Harbor in Wales. Amelia thus became the first woman to cross the Atlantic. After returning to the United States, she was warmly welcomed by the nationals and even the president, but Amelia was not proud of it. She regarded her performance in the flight was not satisfactory and candidly said ""Stultz did all the flying-had to. I was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes.""She added,""... maybe someday I'll try it alone.""</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573006270/ofkakohd6rpmbwpdgdvi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Amelia worked secretly on her plans to make a solo flight across the Atlantic. On May 20, 1932, Amelia drove NR-7952 Lockheed 5B Vega from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, Canada to Paris, France. At first, the flight was very smooth, but in 14 hours and 54 minutes, the sudden appearance of strong north wind blew Amelia’s plane away from the scheduled route. Plagued by bad weather, the wings of the flight were full of thick clouds and ice. Amelia had no choice but to force land on a meadow near Londonderry, Northern Ireland. “After scaring the cows in the neighborhood, I pulled up in a farmer’s backyard.” Although she was a little away from the planned destination, she crossed the Atlantic successfully and became the first woman and second solo person to make the flight. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573006294/scnckgls92ylv374nxjl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Xpeda Amelia Collection</h3><p>Amelia is a legendary female pilot.

They flew from Boston, USA, to southern Wales, United Kingdom. Having spent 20 hours and 40 minutes and experienced various bad weather conditions such as blizzard, the plane finally landed successfully in Barry Harbor in Wales. Amelia thus became the first woman to cross the Atlantic. After returning to the United States, she was warmly welcomed by the nationals and even the president, but Amelia was not proud of it. She regarded her performance in the flight was not satisfactory and candidly said ""Stultz did all the flying-had to. I was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes.""She added,""... maybe someday I'll try it alone."" Amelia worked secretly on her plans to make a solo flight across the Atlantic. On May 20, 1932, Amelia drove NR-7952 Lockheed 5B Vega from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, Canada to Paris, France. At first, the flight was very smooth, but in 14 hours and 54 minutes, the sudden appearance of strong north wind blew Amelia’s plane away from the scheduled route. Plagued by bad weather, the wings of the flight were full of thick clouds and ice. Amelia had no choice but to force land on a meadow near Londonderry, Northern Ireland. “After scaring the cows in the neighborhood, I pulled up in a farmer’s backyard.” Although she was a little away from the planned destination, she crossed the Atlantic successfully and became the first woman and second solo person to make the flight.  Xpeda Amelia CollectionAmelia is a legendary female pilot. Her untiring advocates in freedom, risk-taking and the spirit of never giving up, set her many flying records, which are still resounding till now. Her philosophy of life coincides with Xpeda's. To commemorate this first transatlantic woman's achievements and deeds, we deliberately designed a special edition watch to pay tribute to this legendary female pilot and pass on the spirit that ""adventure is worthwhile in itself"".Click here for the full reviewClick here for the full reviewClick here for the full reviewClick here for the full review  Adaptation of the NR7952 Lockheed 5B Vega NR7952 Lockheed 5B Vega is one of the aircraft that help Amelia achieve her legendary status. Airplanes during that era rarely use a bright colour on their plane, the NR7952 eye-catching colour and design never fail to attract attention. To redefine the aviation watch design and commemorate this legendary aircraft, we use the colour tone of the NR7952 aircraft on our watch to make it stand out from the crowd.  Aircraft Flight InstrumentThe design of the dial, including the dial index, pattern, and the hands are all referenced to the aircraft flight instrument, from which the pilot can easily see the time and other information. We transfer this feature from an aircraft cockpit to an ordinary user’s wrist, allowing them to read the time at a quick glance.  Aviator sunglassesThe open balance wheel window on the watch dial is like the pilot’s eye and is the soul of the watch. Based on the photochromic sunglasses that pilots wear during flight, we applied the photochromic lens on the open-heart window of the watch dial to further relate this aviation watch piece to Amelia's legacy.    

 
 Introducing the ""Umbra Lens""We make the open-heart display window lens from a photochromic sunglass worn by pilots. This lens will darken with the intensity of the UV. We named this technology “Umbra”. Resembling the lunar eclipse when the sun is blocked by the earth, Umbra lenses represent this astronomic beauty on the watch, making it more interesting.  Open Heart DisplayWe added a circular display window at the 9 o’clock position to allow the user to see the beautiful operation of the balance wheel. Xpeda is the first watch brand to use “Umber” Transition Lens as the material for the open-heart display window. The window will have its colour darkened according to the UV intensity of the environment. The lens is transparent in an indoor environment to display the movement balance and will gradually darken under a strong sunlight environment without covering the contents of the movement. Such a design can protect the delicate part of the mechanical movement and add some fun elements to the watch. Case and FinishingWe use 316L solid stainless steel for this watch case. With a diameter and a thickness of 42 mm & 12mm, weight in at 108g, it makes the watch suitable for males and females on different occasions. To give it a strong metal and contrast astatic, Amelia Vega Red case is polished to a perfect mirror finish and the lug with a brushed metal finish.We also offer two other variants to the Amelia collection–The Amelia Sahara Black & Amelia Jet black. We finish the Amelia Sahara black case in matte black with desert sand numerals. On the Amelia Jet Black, the case is finished in matte black but we finish the numerals in metallic grey.  The concept behind this design is to further relate this watch to its pilot watch concept. Besides that, the all-black design gives this watch a sense of mystery and closely aligns with the adventure seeker's spirit. LensWe use K1 hardened mineral high dome glass as the lens to give it a three-dimensional look. The bottom layer of the glass is coated with anti-reflective material to enable the user to see the time from different angles. Exhibition Case back To match the holistic design of the watch, we polish the stainless steel case to a mirror-like finish, while the black case will have a sandblasted finish. The names of Xpeda and Amelia are engraved on the case back to commemorate her legend. We adopt a display back design to showcase the mechanical movement. 316L stainless steel is used on the case back as well. Dial and HandsThe rough texture on the watch dial makes it more layered and multi-dimensional. We adopt a perspective design at the 9 o’clock position to showcase the delicate balance wheel. The diamond-shaped design of the watch hands and the numbers are inspired by the aircraft’s flight instrument. LuminousTo allow the pilot to see the information on the aircraft at night, the aircraft will incorporate the luminous function on the cockpit instrument. So, we adopted this design on our watch. By adding the Swiss luminous function, the hands will appear in pale green under a dark environment.MovementThe NH38A movement of the watch is an automatic movement manufactured by Japan Seiko, with high accuracy, reliability, and longevity. This 3 hands self-winding mechanical movement features a second hands reset function and bi-directional winding system with an accuracy of -20 to +40 seconds per day. The power reserve is up to 41 hours. Vibration frequency is 6 vibrations per second, equivalent to 21,600 vibrations per hour. The movement carries 24 jewels and anti-magnetic up to 4,800 A/m. Italian Leather StrapWe make the straps from Italian genuine leather. Italian leather is renowned for its material and craftsmanship.

The Xpeda backstage clutch bag will be the standard packaging in the future.

<h2>Why Turn to Crowdfunding?</h2>
<p>Imagine receiving a new order every week, or even every day, and having to reach out to your ever-so-busy seamstresses, who have another full-time job and a house and a husband and kids and cats, and asking them to finalize the order as soon as humanly possible so the customer gets it on time, as promised.</p>
<p>This is not a viable business model, and it is less and less feasible as we grow. </p>
<p>Plus, it takes a tremendous amount of time, effort and money to make our products, since everything is made by hand. </p>
<p>Sure it sounds lovely and all, but we cannot keep growing and uphold a handcrafted production model!</p>
<h3>Our Production Dilemma </h3>
<p>Right now, we are caught in a vicious circle: we kind of receive too many orders to meet demands and deal with delays, but we kind of don't receive enough orders to be able to carry a small inventory and have them crafted by an experienced and well-equipped manufacturer. <br/><br/>Most garment factories, even the small ethical ones in Canada, ask for rather high minimal production quantities. </p>
<h3>Our Fabric Supplies</h3>
<p>Our eco-friendly fabric suppliers also ask for minimum order quantities. If these minimums are not met, we need to pay extra. Another vicious cycle we are trapped in! </p>
<h3>You, Our Saviors! </h3>
<p>This is why we need your precious help!<br/><br/>We are offering you incredible discounts on our best-selling products so you can enjoy a genuinely eco-friendly, ethical and high-quality product, while we can slowly increase the scale of our production in order to decrease costs of production and offer better turnaround times to you, our beloved clientele. </p>
<h3>A Just-In-Time, Small-Batch Model</h3>
<p>Don't worry, we will still produce in very small batches compared with the industry's standards. That way, we ensure we do not waste hundreds of clothes that are stuck in our inventory each season. </p>
<p>The manufacturer we have selected to craft your rewards is based in Quebec, Canada. They have over 40 years of experience in women's fashion, and grow every year to create jobs in which workers are well treated and equitably paid. </p>
<p>And yes! A part of our production will remain artisanal for now, so our seamstresses won't go out of business! </p>
<h3>We Want to Grow!</h3>
<p>We want to grow worldwide and offer our sustainable products to even more women. </p>

</div></div>","WinWinter Heated Insoles technology was designed for maintaining an optimal temperature for your feet. Did you know, that your feet are crucial when it comes to regulating your overall body temperature? Warm
feet means warm body and insoles are designed simply to keep you warm. The Insoles have wide temperature range for you to choose your most comfortable level.
Compared to similar existing products on the market, WinWinter insoles have following main advantages due to its advanced technology:

 Wireless Charging: 


No
need to take the insoles out every time to charge it. You simply place the
small charging modules inside each shoe. 
While it charges, it also dries your insoles. 

Makes insoles more durable. The issue with wired charging insoles is that when moisture damages connectors on the insole over time. WinWinter insoles eliminate the issue by implementing wireless charging technology making insoles last a lot longer and allowing to create truly waterproof insoles.  




 Fully Automated



Insoles turn on when your feet
temperature goes below your chosen comfortable warmth level and turn off when your comfortable temperature is reached.


Sensor integrated in the insole is like a big button that turns on by touch, so the product works even when you sit or lie down. 






    Waterproof 


Insoles are made of waterproof material. Since wireless charger doesn't need charging connector that is sensitive to moister, WinWinter are fully waterproof. Insoles have been tested by divers and proved to work under water.

     Charge lasts for 10 hours


82.4°F is comfortable temperature for your feet. At that setting level fully charged insoles work 10 hours constantly turned on. Charge can even last for many days depending on outside temperature and your daily activities.


  Made comfortable for you to keep for long time


WinWinter insoles are made of high quality hygienic and hypoallergenic material. Each insole has orthopedic cushion, with an instep raiser for extended heel support. 
Main heating element is located around the toes because the forefoot starts to feel cold first. 
Made with high-wear resistance where control card and battery are covered by metal protective housing that helps to avoid deformation under body weight. 

Li-Po battery intended for multiple charging.







Story behind the idea
Initially there was an idea
to make something useful and simple for people. Something that will solve a problem and something that is worth doing. Creating the heated insoles
seemed like a great idea. It could solve the problem of vital importance of dealing with adverse weather conditions.


First steps
To start we bought all similar products that we managed to find on the Internet to see if the
problem is solved. While testing them we realized that it's too difficult to use
the models in everyday life. The hassle of manual turning on/off,
charging required taking the insoles out of the shoes and some versions had separated battery mounted to the ankle that was very uncomfortable. Also overtime charging connectors on the insole would get oxidized from moisture which in turn shortens their lifetime especially when fully submerged in snow or water.  
So the goal was to create fully automated heated insoles that are comfortable, durable and hassle free simple to use.
Development path
Our team of engineers are excellent. They generated innovative solutions one after another to get best possible results. To make wireless charging we tried making charging mat, but the
charge power wasn’t enough, so we made a dryer (the insoles are magnetized with
dryer to charge and get dry at the same time). We’ve tested on/off button, multi-layer plate, 2
thermo-sensing elements before we came to the final solution with the capacitive
sensor that seems to be the most convenient and reliable for reaching our goal. Our team of engineers kept on improving other technological aspects after getting feedback from people using the product. Automated temperature control was a great solution because we got many responses from people not liking the hassle of having extra device to switch on and off. The goal was to make so people didn't have to worry and think but could just put on their shoes and forget about getting cold feet. After making the wireless charger and getting rid of exposed connectors we were able to make fully waterproof insoles. For battery our team solved numerous engineering tasks to make it safe while providing optimal usage time and fitting well with overall design to stay comfortable.  We have combined control units into main control card to safe space. Battery and control card were protected with metal housing that helps to avoid deformation under body weight withstanding up to 660 pounds.  Also we made sure insoles were comfortable to wear and at the same time had durable material. Our tests showed that the fastest and most effective way to make the feet warm was to put carbon fiber heating around toes and outside of the foot.   
 





The Impact 


The funds raised will give WinWinter product jump start.  It will be used for operations, marketing and production to enter the market full force. The product has already been successfully tested in the market. There is an agreement with 8 factories for
the production. We need to make the product package, prepare press moulds for
all the insole sizes and for charging device.




Risks & Challenges

At first we're going to produce a small batch
of the product so we can improve on all the details for the next batch. There may appear technical issues
in the assembly of the parts stage as a lot of manual work is to be done. The
engineers are ready to join the production process promptly. The product is constantly being tested thoroughly and actually no more obstacles are seen at the
moment.

Backing the project is more than just sharing the money. Its supporting the dream to create something that the inventors and developers want to see exist in the world.

<p>
</p>
<p>Giza Dress was born in 2014 with the aim of valorize a brand 100%  born and produced in Italy, to revive the tradition of the concept of fashion based on a flexible and authentic look. The goal is to get around the big profit margins of the retail channel, most often inflated by the brand awareness and advertising marketing, and distribute products directly on the web, at much lower prices. Last year we have invested in research and agreements in the production of a capsule collection with partners  with refined and innovative feature. Now we need a further effort to realize all our sacrifices, and for this reason  we need your help. Our goal is to let us know more about our field sales, and get different feedback that will be useful for defining  next collections. We want to share  our project, appointing you an integral part of our company, and give you the chance to get into the mindset Giza. If you believe in our work and would like to support us, read on and discover all the possibilities that we offer to be one of us.<br/></p>

</div></div>","About Gizadress
Giza is a new clothing brand that offers products born from the fashion concept of four young Italians, who in turn are major consumers and consequently creative interpreters. Our mission is to offer people the quality of the fabrics chosen and created in the Italian territory, with market quotations centered for the public of all age. We want to offer the consumers elements giving them the opportunity to differentiate themselves, and make their style iconic.
Design
Every garment Giza is the result of a specific research area, in order to enable and  to adapt it to any character and physique. The collection can range between different targets. The fit and the right juncture between basic and fashion allows us to attract the interest of many consumers.Quality and Materials
The challenge for us is to offer fine fabrics in all our heads, so we have chosen production sites of the Italian territory, who use only the finest materials. The processes are subject to constant supervision by experts, who donate to our items the feature of a hand-crafted. For this production we have chosen 100% cotton.  The ongoing research has allowed us to plan the launch of innovative products, like our hi tech bag with solar panels, which can be useful for charging different devices that follow us during our days in a busy world where it is important to be always connected.




Collections and Inspirations

All our products draw inspiration from the value given to the name of our brand.Giza is a city that owes its importance to accommodate the three most famous Egyptian pyramids. The brand is closely related to art and everything related to it. This item will be taken up and revised in a futuristic and artistic view in every collection.


Entrepreneurial Operation

We dedicated to Giza two years before launching on the market, because we tried all the original elements that could ensure sales arguments interesting. despite the majority of Italian business are emigrating abroad to receive tax breaks and produce at much lower prices, we wanted to challenge this trend and go against it, remaining faithful to the production at home, to revive the spirit of the real made in Italy.






History


Giza Dress was born in 2014 with the aim of valorize a brand 100%  born and produced in Italy, to revive the tradition of the concept of fashion based on a flexible and authentic look. The goal is to get around the big profit margins of the retail channel, most often inflated by the brand awareness and advertising marketing, and distribute products directly on the web, at much lower prices. Last year we have invested in research and agreements in the production of a capsule collection with partners  with refined and innovative feature. Now we need a further effort to realize all our sacrifices, and for this reason  we need your help. Our goal is to let us know more about our field sales, and get different feedback that will be useful for defining  next collections. We want to share  our project, appointing you an integral part of our company, and give you the chance to get into the mindset Giza. If you believe in our work and would like to support us, read on and discover all the possibilities that we offer to be one of us.



How the money will be invested

All that we can get, will be used in this way
• Finance Spring/Summer 2015 campaign


• Finance Spring/Summer 2015 production
• Maintain a high profile of web and adv marketing 



Taking care
We would like to attract the attention of all the people, from simple purchasers of clothing to potential emerging designers. For who will finance our project, we guarantee a member card with an extra discount that will not expire, a relief to walk in Giza's world feeling like a small piece of the puzzle of an ambitious project. In addition we'll issue a thanksgiving message reporting your full name on a dedicated section on our web site.

that although apparently might seem equal to many others can actually be only
similar, never the same.<span><br/>
<span>All small universes that make up the human race are
different from each other by virtue of the elements that compose them, elements
dictated by life experiences, personal inclinations acquired and innate and
influences that in the various times of each of our lives are in contact with
each single individual for longer or shorter periods, past or even present.<br/>
<span>And ... In this new era in which the various
individuals tend to be seen as simple bits stacked in databases of large
companies and government agencies it is particularly important to give space
and to highlight the own real identity.</span></span></span></p><div>
</div><p>Nowadays everyone possesses a smartphone, that thanks
to its versatile nature allows us to customize the quality, quantity and
appearance of our data, our applications and interface with which we interact
with it.<br/>
A small glimpse of our person, of the wonder inherent in us that,
unfortunately, is enclosed within the impersonal standardized form of our
apparatus.<br/>
A uniqueness, ours, which is imprisoned from the outward appearance of a
smartphone produced in millions of pieces all at the same.<br/>
<br/>
<span>In certain ways our smartphone is almost a life
partner through which we can face life in its various aspects, working, social,
emotional and loving.<br/>
And just as a result of its role as partner of everyday life, it reflects and reveals
our being in many of its facets.</span></p><div>
And at this point the obvious
question.<br/>
Why to limit our uniqueness, our being, our tastes, within our phone?</div><div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246454/files/20150224143753-1_3_.png?1424817473"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div><span>From this simple question arises our project; <strong>Smartphone Stands customized,
unique pieces in the world and able to communicate and enhance properly the
small universe inherent in its owner.</strong></span></div><div><span><span>
<span>Having all of us a great value and wishing to
communicate and give importance to this value, usually not adequately taken into account; we
thought, sketched, drawn, designed and realized something that can live up to
the arduous task for which it was conceived.</span></span></span></div><div><span><span><span>
<span><strong>Giving voice to our being, in a nutshell, means to
give the chance to customize till the extreme the object that belongs to us,
being able to get to make it unique, ours and only ours, in the materiality, in itself
and in the soul that the object acquires.</strong></span></span></span></span></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246457/files/20150224144038-10_3_.png?1424817638"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Each Smartphone Stand is not made on an assembly line,
but it is made as a single piece, piece in which there is manual work, the
attention and the experience of the person who will carry out following your
specific requests, ensuring that inside of this there is the fusion of the
accomplisher’s passion and experience, with the taste and choices arising from
life experience and innate abilities of those who will possess it.</strong><br/>
<br/>
<span><strong>To do this we have chosen quality fabrics, result of
the most sophisticated modern technology.</strong></span><span><strong><br/>
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Each of the fabrics proposed is waterproof and fire retardant in order to make
the transportation of our life partner as secure as possible.</strong></span></p>
All fabrics are ecological and
have the textures and colors visible in the images (with different zoom).<span><br/>
</span><p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246474/files/20150224144650-tessuti1_2_.png?1424818010"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246476/files/20150224144806-tessuti2_2_.png?1424818086"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246483/files/20150224144955-tessuti3_2_.png?1424818195"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>But the quality of a fabric alone is not able to make an excellent and
above average quality product, to achieve exceptional results studies are required
studies, experiments and the wisdom of creative that combine a large experience
in the fashion industry with the great ability to innovate, leading to
solutions that no one had reached before.<span><br/>
<span>Make an idea and a fabric become a solid reality
requires skill and this skill is the one that has allowed us to turn into a
solid and durable reality what imagined, thanks to a careful selection and
design of the various components, in fact the proposed <strong>Smartphone Stands are
also resistant to the most extreme environmental conditions and are able to
withstand wear, tear and strong stresses to which life could expose them</strong>.<br/>
<br/>
The only quality, versatility and durability, however, are not able to make an
object really unique, but are only able to make it an excellent product equal
to all similar that would be produced along with him, as well as fabrics in
itself, despite the variety proposed, are mass-produced, yards and yards of fabric
all the same to themselves and... from this simple consideration the choice of the
embroidery unique and made individually on each piece.</span></span>
</div><div>But ... As said before, giving voice to our being means to give the opportunity
to customize to the extreme, so that the object created is equivalent to an
object created in every way from you and this chance is reflected in the
choices, besides the fabric and the thread used for the embroidery and the seams,
the layout, the design and the word (or words) that you will want to embroider
on this.<span><br/>
<br/>
</span>Even for the wires has been dedicated all the attention and the research
used for the fabrics and the result is a variety of yarns different for colors
and characteristics.<br/>
Among all the features taken into account and evaluated during the phase of
project, one is worthy of note, the phosphorescence (not to be confused with
the fluorescence).<br/>
Yes ... If you want you can choose between four (4) colors which will start to
shine at nightfall.</div><div>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246498/files/20150224145636-fili1_2_.png?1424818596"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

</div><p>
</p><div>
</div><p>Being our saying ""Wide variety of choice!"",
this feature is also selectable.<br/>
The colors are those visible in the images and at the time when it will list
the characteristics desired you can decide the color (9 <span>variations</span>) and its eventual
phosphorescence (except black, present only in coloring NOT phosphorescent).</p><div>
As mentioned, these wires are
used to embroider drawings and writing according to the layout chosen because the
""layout"" is something very personal that says a lot about us and which
result is critical to the satisfaction of those who create.</div><p>The choices available are shown in the figure and are even five (5).<br/>
The first three layouts allow the writing of Names, Names and Surnames,
Pseudonyms and short sentences, up to a maximum of twenty (20) characters.<br/>
The fifth fourth gives the ability to insert a drawing (which for reasons of space
will be a little smaller than the selectable with the fifth layout) and a writing

<br/><span>
Of course, a writing, a name, a pseudonym are very personal, indeed unique, but
we felt that this would not be enough and wanting to realize the uniqueness and
the absolutely personal, we thought of another possibility, the choice of a
character among six (6) combinations.</span>
</div><div>
<span></span>Basically, whenever we put our signature, actually we spread our
experience and our personality, which graphologists study, analyze and examine from
a very long time; and to give the opportunity to choose a character, allows us
to give vent, even if in a lightly more limited way compared to a signature, of
what belongs to us, that is in us, and that is right, is an integrating part of
the unique object and of great value that you would like to realize.<br/>
<br/><span>
Furthermore, as anticipated based on the layout chosen one could also choose a
design among those available, whose realizations are visible in the images and that
have been made trying to accomplish the best possible merger between classical
and modern searching in each of them the artistic particularity able to make it
unique and different from all the Others.</span>

But we did not stop here.</p><div>
<strong>

Your Smartphone Stand must not
only be beautiful and personal, it must also be functional, so we were not
limited to choosing the right fabrics to make it versatile and convenient,
making it able to withstand time, wear, efforts, water and fire, but we did a
big study to make it as ergonomic and comfortable as possible</strong>.<br/>
<br/><span>
The model foresees the possibility to be brought to the belt, which is very,
very difficult for a Smartphone of big size, it was therefore necessary to find
a solution to make it comfortable and enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
Smartphone and Smartphone Stands, thanks to the study
of the shape of this latter are not disabling.</span>
</div><div>
<span><strong>
Everything is always handy, both standing and sitting or even lying down, on
any surface (chairs, sofas, beds, cars seats, buses, trains or planes).<br/>
</strong><br/>
Additionally you can take it over your shoulder, you can use it as a hook for
the keychain, the purse, the earphone holder etc ... etc ...</span>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246648/files/20150224155240-13_2_.png?1424821960"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
</div><p>Specifically, we
wanted to give the opportunity to anyone who wishes to make the Smartphone
Stand even more practical giving this more versatility and enabling it to
interface serving as support for additional elements by which to make the
experience of its possession even more unique and enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
<span>The base model includes a belt connector, but you may
want more.</span></p><div>

It is possible to have two
practical eyelets to which connect a keychain, a spring-catch, a USB key, etc
... etc ..., as you can use them to put a pen or any object by tapered shape.<span><br/>
<span>Moreover, you may want even more, you may want a
shoulder strap, thanks to which bring the Smartphone Stand through this instead
of the belt.</span></span>
</div><div>To allow its use in any situation (when you make your sports, when you walk, when you rest, etc... etc...) the shoulder strap is adjustable in length.</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246683/files/20150224160340-9_3_.png?1424822620"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But we went over, giving the opportunity to also have a practical pouch
made in the same fabric with which it will be realized the Smartphone Stand, which
can be used according to your needs (ex. Earphones holder, purse, USB keys
holder, etc... etc...).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246694/files/20150224160937-WP_20150126_15_44_53_Pro_3_.png?1424822977"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>And finally, we could not think of the fulfillment of a key-chain, also
made with the same fabric of the Smartphone Stand, stitched with the same
thread and that according to our tastes, needs or choices, can also be attached
to the Smartphone Stand itself through the eyelets mentioned before (just like
the little bag and the shoulder-belt), or simply kept in your pocket, bag, or
where it is more comfortable.</span></p>
</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246696/files/20150224161204-WP_20150126_15_58_13_Pro_3_.png?1424823124"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>
<p><span>All the qualities and possibilities listed so far mean that this object
has not a connotation, a framing or a specific target, but these features are
such as to make it a suitable object available for anyone because this Smartphone
Stand has not a sporting or elegant look, has not as a target young people or
adults, fashion fans or practicality fans.<br/>
<br/><span><strong>
This Smartphone Stand is an expression of whom owns it and is really the self-expression
that will make it the most similar as possible to us, making it become exactly
as you want.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, through the choice of the fabric, the layout, the thread, the embroidery,
the possible gadgets, this object can be elegant, sporting, exclusive, casual,
fashionable, practical, fashion, etc ... etc ...</strong></span></span></p>

</p>
<p>Ognuno di noi ha in sé un piccolo universo che anche se
all'apparenza potrebbe sembrare uguale a molti altri in realtà può essere
solamente simile, mai uguale.<br/></p>
<p>Tutti i piccoli universi che compongono il genere umano sono
differenti tra loro in virtù degli elementi che li compongono, elementi dettati
da esperienze di vita, inclinazioni personali acquisite ed innate e le
influenze che nei vari momenti di ognuna delle nostre esistenze vengono a
contatto con ogni singolo individuo per periodi più o meno lunghi, passati o
ancora presenti.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E... In questa nuova epoca in cui i vari individui tendono ad
essere visti come semplici bit impilati nei database di grandi aziende ed enti
governativi è particolarmente importante dare spazio e mettere in risalto la
propria identità reale.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Oggi giorno tutti possediamo uno smartphone, che grazie alla
sua natura versatile ci permette di personalizzare la qualità, la quantità e
l'aspetto dei nostri dati, delle nostre applicazioni e dell'interfaccia con cui
ci relazioniamo con esso.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Un piccolo scorcio della nostra persona, della meraviglia
insita in noi che purtroppo è racchiuso all'interno dell'impersonale forma
standardizzata del nostro apparato.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Un'unicità, la nostra, che viene imprigionata
dall'esteriorità di uno smartphone prodotto in milioni di pezzi tutti uguali
tra loro.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Per molti versi il nostro smartphone è quasi un compagno di
vita grazie al quale riusciamo ad affrontare l'esistenza nei suoi vari aspetti,
lavorativo, sociale, sentimentale ed amoroso.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E proprio in conseguenza del suo ruolo di compagno di vita
quotidiana, rispecchia e fa trasparire il nostro essere in molte delle sue
sfaccettature.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ed a questo punto l'ovvia domanda.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Perchè limitare la nostra unicità, il nostro essere, i nostri
gusti, all'interno del nostro telefono?<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249513/files/20150225162245-1_3_.png?1424910165"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Da questa semplice domanda nasce il nostro progetto;<strong> Porta
Smartphone personalizzati, pezzi unici al mondo ed in grado di comunicare e
valorizzare a dovere il piccolo universo insito nel suo possessore.</strong></p>
<p>
Avendo ognuno di noi un grande valore e volendo comunicare e
dare importanza a questo valore solitamente non adeguatamente tenuto in
considerazione abbiamo pensato, schematizzato, elaborato, progettato e
realizzato qualcosa che possa essere all'altezza dell'arduo compito per cui è
stato concepito.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Dare voce al nostro essere, in poche parole, vuol dire dare
la possibilità di personalizzare fino all'estremo l'oggetto che ci appartiene
potendo arrivare a renderlo unico, nostro e solamente nostro, nella materialità
in sé e nell'anima che l'oggetto acquisisce.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249521/files/20150225162355-10_3_.png?1424910235"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Ogni Porta Smartphone non è realizzato in catena di
montaggio, ma è realizzato come pezzo unico, pezzo in cui è presente il lavoro
manuale, l'attenzione e l'esperienza della persona che lo realizzerà seguendo
le vostre precise richieste, facendo sì che all'interno di questo vi sia la
fusione della passione e dell'esperienza del realizzatore, con il gusto e le
scelte derivanti dalle esperienze di vita e dalle doti innate di chi lo
possiederà.</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Per fare questo abbiamo scelto tessuti di pregio frutto delle
più sofisticate tecnologie moderne.</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>Ognuno dei tessuti proposti è impermeabile ed ignifugo al
fine di rendere il trasporto del nostro compagno di vita quanto più sicuro
possibile.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Tutti i tessuti sono ecologici e dispongono delle trame e dei
colori visibili nelle immagini (con differenti zoom).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249527/files/20150225162639-tessuti1_2_.png?1424910399"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249528/files/20150225162659-tessuti2_2_.png?1424910419"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249530/files/20150225162713-tessuti3_2_.png?1424910433"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ma la qualità di un tessuto da sola non è in grado di rendere
un prodotto eccellente ed al di sopra della qualità media, per ottenere
risultati eccezionali sono necessari studi, esperimenti e la sapienza di
creativi in grado di combinare una grande esperienza nel settore della moda con
la grande capacità di innovare, giungendo a soluzioni cui nessuno era mai
giunto prima.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Far sì che un’idea ed un tessuto diventino una solida realtà
richiede maestria e questa maestria è quella che ci ha permesso di tramutare in
una solida e resistente realtà quanto immaginato, grazie ad un’attenta
selezione ed un'attenta progettazione delle varie componenti, infatti <strong>i
portasmartphone proposti sono resistenti anche alle più estreme condizioni
ambientali e sono in grado di resistere all’usura, agli strappi ed alle forti
sollecitazioni alle quali la vita potrebbe esporli.</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Le sole qualità, versatilità e resistenza però non sono in
grado di rendere un oggetto realmente unico, ma sono solamente capaci di
renderlo un ottimo prodotto uguale a tutti i simili che verrebbero prodotti
insieme a lui, così come i tessuti in sé, nonostante la varietà proposta, sono
prodotti di massa, metri e metri di tessuto tutti uguali a se stessi e… da
questa semplice considerazione la scelta del ricamo unico e realizzato
singolarmente su ogni pezzo.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ma... Come detto prima dare voce al nostro essere vuol dire
dare la possibilità di personalizzare all'estremo, far sì che l'oggetto creato
sia equivalente ad un oggetto creato in tutto e per tutto da voi e questa
possibilità si traduce nelle scelte, oltre che del tessuto, del filo utilizzato
per il ricamo e le cuciture, del layout, del disegno e della parola (o parole)
che si vorranno ricamare su di questo.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Anche per i fili è stata dedicata tutta l'attenzione e la
ricerca utilizzata per i tessuti ed il risultato è una varietà di filati
differenti per colori e caratteristiche.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Tra tutte le caratteristiche tenute in considerazione e
vagliate durante la fase di progetto una è degna di nota, la fosforescenza (da
non confondere con la fluorescenza).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Sì... Qualora lo si volesse si potrà scegliere tra ben quattro
(4) colori che inizieranno a brillare al calar del buio.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249535/files/20150225162924-fili1_2_.png?1424910564"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249536/files/20150225162931-fili2_2_.png?1424910571"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Essendo il nostro motto, “Larga varietà di scelta!”, anche questa
caratteristica è sceglibile.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I colori sono quelli visibili nelle immagini e nel momento in
cui si elencheranno le caratteristiche volute si potrà decidere il colore (9 varianti) e la
sua eventuale fosforescenza (tranne il nero, presente solo in colorazione NON
fosforescente).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Questi fili come detto servono per ricamare disegni e scritte
in base al layout scelto poiché “l'impaginazione” è qualcosa di molto personale
che dice molto di noi ed il cui risultato è fondamentale per la soddisfazione
di chi crea.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Le scelte disponibili sono mostrate in figura e sono
addirittura cinque (5).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I primi tre layout permettono la scrittura di Nomi, Nomi e
Cognomi, Pseudonimi e brevi frasi, fino ad un massimo di venti (20) caratteri.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Il quarto da la possibilità di inserire un disegno (che per
motivi di spazio sarà un po' più piccolo di quello sceglibile con il quinto
layout) ed una scritta formata da cinque (5) caratteri.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Il quinto layout invece utilizza tutta la superficie
disponibile per realizzare uno dei sette (7) disegni tra cui è possibile
scegliere.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249539/files/20150225163034-Layout1_2_.png?1424910634"" src="""" style=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249542/files/20150225163044-Layout2_2_.png?1424910644"" src="""" style=""""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249544/files/20150225163055-Layout3_2_.png?1424910655"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Naturalmente una scritta, un nome, uno pseudonimo sono molto
personali, anzi unici, ma abbiamo ritenuto che questo non potesse bastare e
volendo realizzare l’unicità e l’assolutamente personale, abbiamo pensato ad
un’ulteriore possibilità, la scelta di un carattere tra ben sei (6)
combinazioni.</p>
<p>In fondo, ogni volta che apponiamo la nostra firma, in realtà
stendiamo il nostro vissuto e la nostra personalità, cosa che i grafologi
studiano, analizzano ed esaminano da moltissimo tempo; e dare la possibilità di
scegliere un carattere, ci permette di dare sfogo anche se in maniera
leggermente più limitata rispetto ad una firma, di quel che ci appartiene, che
è insito in noi e che è giusto sia parte integrante dell’oggetto unico e di
grande valore che si vorrebbe realizzare.</p>
<p>Inoltre come anticipato in base al layout scelto si potrebbe

<p>Cedendo alle tentazioni ingegneristiche le combinazioni
possibili date da tutti gli elementi su cui è possibile scegliere sono
12 * 9 * 5 * 7 * 6 * 3 = 68.040 alle quali si aggiunge la personalizzazione estrema della

<p>Però, non ci siamo fermati qui.</p>
<p><strong>Il vostro portasmartphone non deve essere solo bello e
personale, deve essere anche funzionale, quindi non ci siamo limitati alla
scelta dei giusti tessuti al fine di renderlo versatile e comodo rendendolo
capace di resistere al tempo, all’usura, agli sforzi, all'acqua ed al fuoco, ma
abbiamo fatto un grande studio per renderlo quanto più ergonomico e comodo
possibile.</strong></p>
<p>Il modello prevede la possibilità di essere portato a
cintura, cosa molto, molto difficile per uno smartphone di grandi dimensioni, è
stato dunque necessario trovare una soluzione per renderlo comodo e fruibile.</p>
<p>Smartphone e portasmartphone, grazie allo studio della forma
di quest'ultimo non sono invalidanti.</p>
<p><strong>Il tutto è sempre comodo, sia
stando in piedi che seduti o addirittura sdraiati, su qualunque superficie
(sedie, divani, letti, sedili di automobili, autobus, treni o aerei).</strong></p>
<p>In più è possibile portarlo a tracolla, è possibile
utilizzarlo come aggancio per il portachiavi, il portamonete, il porta
auricolari etc... etc...</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>E già, avendo pensato di realizzare qualcosa che dovesse essere
il massimo, abbiamo ritenuto necessario andare oltre, rendendo disponibili
accessori unici ma dando la possibilità di sceglierli come optional.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Nello specifico si è voluto dare la possibilità a chiunque lo
desiderasse di rendere ancora più pratico il portasmartphone dando a questo
maggiore versatilità e rendendolo capace di interfacciarsi proponendosi come
supporto per elementi aggiuntivi grazie ai quali rendere ancora più unica e
piacevole l’esperienza del suo possesso.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Il modello base prevede l’attacco a cintura, ma si può volere
di più.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>E’ possibile avere due pratici occhielli ai quali collegare
un portachiavi, un moschettone, una chiavetta usb, etc… etc…, così come è
possibile utilizzarli per inserirci una biro o un qual si voglia oggetto dalla
forma affusolata.</p></span><p><span>
Inoltre, si può volere ancora
di più, si può volere una tracolla, grazie alla quale portare il
portasmartphone attraverso questa anziché alla cintura.</span></p>
<p><span>Al fine di renderne possibile l'utilizzo nelle più svariate situazioni (quando si praticano i nostri sport preferiti, quando si cammina, quando si corre, quando ci si riposa), la tracolla è regolabile in lunghezza, su una larghissima escursione.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249567/files/20150225164029-9_3_.png?1424911229"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>Ma siamo andati oltre, dando la possibilità di avere anche
una pratica bustina realizzata nel medesimo tessuto con cui sarà realizzato il
portasmartphone che potrà essere utilizzata in base alle proprie esigenze (es.
porta auricolari, porta monete, porta chiavette usb, etc… etc…).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249570/files/20150225164141-WP_20150126_15_44_53_Pro_3_.png?1424911301"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><p>Ed infine, non potevamo non pensare alla realizzazione di un
portachiavi, anch’esso realizzato con lo stesso tessuto del portasmartphone,
cucito con il medesimo filo e che in base ai propri gusti, necessità o scelte,
potrà essere anche attaccato al portasmartphone stesso tramite gli occhielli
prima menzionati (esattamente come la bustina e la tracolla), o semplicemente
tenuto in tasca, in borsa o dove si è più comodi.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1249571/files/20150225164239-WP_20150126_15_58_13_Pro_3_.png?1424911359"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
</p><p>Tutte le qualità e le possibilità elencate finora fanno sì
che questo oggetto non abbia una connotazione, un inquadramento o uno specifico
target, ma queste caratteristiche sono tali da renderlo un oggetto indicato e
disponibile per chiunque poiché questo portasmartphone non ha una connotazione
sportiva o elegante, non ha come target i giovani o gli adulti, gli
appassionati di moda o gli appassionati di praticità.</p>
<p><strong>Questo portasmartphone è espressione di chi lo possiede ed è
proprio l’espressione di sé che lo renderà il più affine possibile a noi,
facendolo divenire esattamente come lo si vorrà.</strong></p><strong>
</strong><p><strong>Infatti, attraverso la scelta del tessuto, del layout, del
filo, del ricamo, dei possibili gadget, questo oggetto potrà essere elegante,
sportivo, di classe, casual, alla moda, pratico, fashion, etc… etc…</strong> </p>

To the first 10/15 backers is reserved a special offer: for more datails watch perks reserved to this special offer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Each of us has inside of himself a little universe
that although apparently might seem equal to many others can actually be only
similar, never the same.
All small universes that make up the human race are
different from each other by virtue of the elements that compose them, elements
dictated by life experiences, personal inclinations acquired and innate and
influences that in the various times of each of our lives are in contact with
each single individual for longer or shorter periods, past or even present.
And ... In this new era in which the various
individuals tend to be seen as simple bits stacked in databases of large
companies and government agencies it is particularly important to give space
and to highlight the own real identity.
Nowadays everyone possesses a smartphone, that thanks
to its versatile nature allows us to customize the quality, quantity and
appearance of our data, our applications and interface with which we interact
with it.
A small glimpse of our person, of the wonder inherent in us that,
unfortunately, is enclosed within the impersonal standardized form of our
apparatus.
A uniqueness, ours, which is imprisoned from the outward appearance of a
smartphone produced in millions of pieces all at the same.

In certain ways our smartphone is almost a life
partner through which we can face life in its various aspects, working, social,
emotional and loving.
And just as a result of its role as partner of everyday life, it reflects and reveals
our being in many of its facets.
And at this point the obvious
question.
Why to limit our uniqueness, our being, our tastes, within our phone?




From this simple question arises our project; Smartphone Stands customized,
unique pieces in the world and able to communicate and enhance properly the
small universe inherent in its owner.
Having all of us a great value and wishing to
communicate and give importance to this value, usually not adequately taken into account; we
thought, sketched, drawn, designed and realized something that can live up to
the arduous task for which it was conceived.
Giving voice to our being, in a nutshell, means to
give the chance to customize till the extreme the object that belongs to us,
being able to get to make it unique, ours and only ours, in the materiality, in itself
and in the soul that the object acquires.

Each Smartphone Stand is not made on an assembly line,
but it is made as a single piece, piece in which there is manual work, the
attention and the experience of the person who will carry out following your
specific requests, ensuring that inside of this there is the fusion of the
accomplisher’s passion and experience, with the taste and choices arising from
life experience and innate abilities of those who will possess it.

To do this we have chosen quality fabrics, result of
the most sophisticated modern technology.

Each of the fabrics proposed is waterproof and fire retardant in order to make
the transportation of our life partner as secure as possible.
All fabrics are ecological and
have the textures and colors visible in the images (with different zoom).


But the quality of a fabric alone is not able to make an excellent and
above average quality product, to achieve exceptional results studies are required
studies, experiments and the wisdom of creative that combine a large experience
in the fashion industry with the great ability to innovate, leading to
solutions that no one had reached before.
Make an idea and a fabric become a solid reality
requires skill and this skill is the one that has allowed us to turn into a
solid and durable reality what imagined, thanks to a careful selection and
design of the various components, in fact the proposed Smartphone Stands are
also resistant to the most extreme environmental conditions and are able to
withstand wear, tear and strong stresses to which life could expose them.

The only quality, versatility and durability, however, are not able to make an
object really unique, but are only able to make it an excellent product equal
to all similar that would be produced along with him, as well as fabrics in
itself, despite the variety proposed, are mass-produced, yards and yards of fabric
all the same to themselves and... from this simple consideration the choice of the
embroidery unique and made individually on each piece.
But ... As said before, giving voice to our being means to give the opportunity
to customize to the extreme, so that the object created is equivalent to an
object created in every way from you and this chance is reflected in the
choices, besides the fabric and the thread used for the embroidery and the seams,
the layout, the design and the word (or words) that you will want to embroider
on this.

Even for the wires has been dedicated all the attention and the research
used for the fabrics and the result is a variety of yarns different for colors
and characteristics.
Among all the features taken into account and evaluated during the phase of
project, one is worthy of note, the phosphorescence (not to be confused with
the fluorescence).
Yes ... If you want you can choose between four (4) colors which will start to
shine at nightfall.




Being our saying ""Wide variety of choice!"",
this feature is also selectable.
The colors are those visible in the images and at the time when it will list
the characteristics desired you can decide the color (9 variations) and its eventual
phosphorescence (except black, present only in coloring NOT phosphorescent).
As mentioned, these wires are
used to embroider drawings and writing according to the layout chosen because the
""layout"" is something very personal that says a lot about us and which
result is critical to the satisfaction of those who create.The choices available are shown in the figure and are even five (5).
The first three layouts allow the writing of Names, Names and Surnames,
Pseudonyms and short sentences, up to a maximum of twenty (20) characters.
The fifth fourth gives the ability to insert a drawing (which for reasons of space
will be a little smaller than the selectable with the fifth layout) and a writing
formed by five (5) characters.
The fourth layout instead uses the entire surface available to achieve one of
the seven (7) designs among which you can choose.


    
  

Of course, a writing, a name, a pseudonym are very personal, indeed unique, but
we felt that this would not be enough and wanting to realize the uniqueness and
the absolutely personal, we thought of another possibility, the choice of a
character among six (6) combinations.

Basically, whenever we put our signature, actually we spread our
experience and our personality, which graphologists study, analyze and examine from
a very long time; and to give the opportunity to choose a character, allows us
to give vent, even if in a lightly more limited way compared to a signature, of
what belongs to us, that is in us, and that is right, is an integrating part of
the unique object and of great value that you would like to realize.

Furthermore, as anticipated based on the layout chosen one could also choose a
design among those available, whose realizations are visible in the images and that
have been made trying to accomplish the best possible merger between classical
and modern searching in each of them the artistic particularity able to make it
unique and different from all the Others.





Yielding to engineering
temptation, the possible combinations given by all the elements on which it is
possible to choose are 12 * 9 * 5 * 7 * 6 * 3 = 68.040 to which is added the
extreme personalization of the writing indicated and decided by you.

But we did not stop here.


Your Smartphone Stand must not
only be beautiful and personal, it must also be functional, so we were not
limited to choosing the right fabrics to make it versatile and convenient,
making it able to withstand time, wear, efforts, water and fire, but we did a
big study to make it as ergonomic and comfortable as possible.

The model foresees the possibility to be brought to the belt, which is very,
very difficult for a Smartphone of big size, it was therefore necessary to find
a solution to make it comfortable and enjoyable.

Smartphone and Smartphone Stands, thanks to the study
of the shape of this latter are not disabling.


Everything is always handy, both standing and sitting or even lying down, on
any surface (chairs, sofas, beds, cars seats, buses, trains or planes).

Additionally you can take it over your shoulder, you can use it as a hook for
the keychain, the purse, the earphone holder etc ... etc ...

Specifically, we
wanted to give the opportunity to anyone who wishes to make the Smartphone
Stand even more practical giving this more versatility and enabling it to
interface serving as support for additional elements by which to make the
experience of its possession even more unique and enjoyable.

The base model includes a belt connector, but you may
want more.

It is possible to have two
practical eyelets to which connect a keychain, a spring-catch, a USB key, etc
... etc ..., as you can use them to put a pen or any object by tapered shape.
Moreover, you may want even more, you may want a
shoulder strap, thanks to which bring the Smartphone Stand through this instead
of the belt.
To allow its use in any situation (when you make your sports, when you walk, when you rest, etc... etc...) the shoulder strap is adjustable in length.

But we went over, giving the opportunity to also have a practical pouch
made in the same fabric with which it will be realized the Smartphone Stand, which
can be used according to your needs (ex. Earphones holder, purse, USB keys
holder, etc... etc...).


And finally, we could not think of the fulfillment of a key-chain, also
made with the same fabric of the Smartphone Stand, stitched with the same
thread and that according to our tastes, needs or choices, can also be attached
to the Smartphone Stand itself through the eyelets mentioned before (just like
the little bag and the shoulder-belt), or simply kept in your pocket, bag, or
where it is more comfortable.

All the qualities and possibilities listed so far mean that this object
has not a connotation, a framing or a specific target, but these features are
such as to make it a suitable object available for anyone because this Smartphone
Stand has not a sporting or elegant look, has not as a target young people or
adults, fashion fans or practicality fans.

This Smartphone Stand is an expression of whom owns it and is really the self-expression
that will make it the most similar as possible to us, making it become exactly
as you want.

In fact, through the choice of the fabric, the layout, the thread, the embroidery,
the possible gadgets, this object can be elegant, sporting, exclusive, casual,
fashionable, practical, fashion, etc ... etc ...
Till to-day, there is no element capable of all this, only this our idea
foresees the realization of something so customizable, so adaptable, so
comfortable, so quality, so high-grade ... Unique, such as who owns it.
All products are made in Italy, with the care, quality, elegance and manufacturing tradition that ""Made in Italy"" guarantees.
But... There are various sizes of smartphones, so... we have created three sizes to choose.
If the height of your smartphone is between 105 mm (4,13'') and 125 mm (4,92'') you can chose size 1.
If the height of your smartphone is between 125 mm (4,92'') and 145 mm (5,71'') you can chose size 2.

Ognuno di noi ha in sé un piccolo universo che anche se
all'apparenza potrebbe sembrare uguale a molti altri in realtà può essere
solamente simile, mai uguale.
Tutti i piccoli universi che compongono il genere umano sono
differenti tra loro in virtù degli elementi che li compongono, elementi dettati
da esperienze di vita, inclinazioni personali acquisite ed innate e le
influenze che nei vari momenti di ognuna delle nostre esistenze vengono a
contatto con ogni singolo individuo per periodi più o meno lunghi, passati o
ancora presenti.


E... In questa nuova epoca in cui i vari individui tendono ad
essere visti come semplici bit impilati nei database di grandi aziende ed enti
governativi è particolarmente importante dare spazio e mettere in risalto la
propria identità reale.


Oggi giorno tutti possediamo uno smartphone, che grazie alla
sua natura versatile ci permette di personalizzare la qualità, la quantità e
l'aspetto dei nostri dati, delle nostre applicazioni e dell'interfaccia con cui
ci relazioniamo con esso.


Un piccolo scorcio della nostra persona, della meraviglia
insita in noi che purtroppo è racchiuso all'interno dell'impersonale forma
standardizzata del nostro apparato.


Un'unicità, la nostra, che viene imprigionata
dall'esteriorità di uno smartphone prodotto in milioni di pezzi tutti uguali
tra loro.


Per molti versi il nostro smartphone è quasi un compagno di
vita grazie al quale riusciamo ad affrontare l'esistenza nei suoi vari aspetti,
lavorativo, sociale, sentimentale ed amoroso.


E proprio in conseguenza del suo ruolo di compagno di vita
quotidiana, rispecchia e fa trasparire il nostro essere in molte delle sue
sfaccettature.


Ed a questo punto l'ovvia domanda.


Perchè limitare la nostra unicità, il nostro essere, i nostri
gusti, all'interno del nostro telefono?


Da questa semplice domanda nasce il nostro progetto; Porta
Smartphone personalizzati, pezzi unici al mondo ed in grado di comunicare e
valorizzare a dovere il piccolo universo insito nel suo possessore.

Avendo ognuno di noi un grande valore e volendo comunicare e
dare importanza a questo valore solitamente non adeguatamente tenuto in
considerazione abbiamo pensato, schematizzato, elaborato, progettato e
realizzato qualcosa che possa essere all'altezza dell'arduo compito per cui è
stato concepito.


Dare voce al nostro essere, in poche parole, vuol dire dare
la possibilità di personalizzare fino all'estremo l'oggetto che ci appartiene
potendo arrivare a renderlo unico, nostro e solamente nostro, nella materialità
in sé e nell'anima che l'oggetto acquisisce.





Ogni Porta Smartphone non è realizzato in catena di
montaggio, ma è realizzato come pezzo unico, pezzo in cui è presente il lavoro
manuale, l'attenzione e l'esperienza della persona che lo realizzerà seguendo
le vostre precise richieste, facendo sì che all'interno di questo vi sia la
fusione della passione e dell'esperienza del realizzatore, con il gusto e le
scelte derivanti dalle esperienze di vita e dalle doti innate di chi lo
possiederà.




Per fare questo abbiamo scelto tessuti di pregio frutto delle
più sofisticate tecnologie moderne.




Ognuno dei tessuti proposti è impermeabile ed ignifugo al
fine di rendere il trasporto del nostro compagno di vita quanto più sicuro
possibile.


Tutti i tessuti sono ecologici e dispongono delle trame e dei
colori visibili nelle immagini (con differenti zoom).







Ma la qualità di un tessuto da sola non è in grado di rendere
un prodotto eccellente ed al di sopra della qualità media, per ottenere
risultati eccezionali sono necessari studi, esperimenti e la sapienza di
creativi in grado di combinare una grande esperienza nel settore della moda con
la grande capacità di innovare, giungendo a soluzioni cui nessuno era mai
giunto prima.


Far sì che un’idea ed un tessuto diventino una solida realtà
richiede maestria e questa maestria è quella che ci ha permesso di tramutare in
una solida e resistente realtà quanto immaginato, grazie ad un’attenta
selezione ed un'attenta progettazione delle varie componenti, infatti i
portasmartphone proposti sono resistenti anche alle più estreme condizioni
ambientali e sono in grado di resistere all’usura, agli strappi ed alle forti
sollecitazioni alle quali la vita potrebbe esporli.


Le sole qualità, versatilità e resistenza però non sono in
grado di rendere un oggetto realmente unico, ma sono solamente capaci di
renderlo un ottimo prodotto uguale a tutti i simili che verrebbero prodotti
insieme a lui, così come i tessuti in sé, nonostante la varietà proposta, sono
prodotti di massa, metri e metri di tessuto tutti uguali a se stessi e… da
questa semplice considerazione la scelta del ricamo unico e realizzato
singolarmente su ogni pezzo.


Ma... Come detto prima dare voce al nostro essere vuol dire
dare la possibilità di personalizzare all'estremo, far sì che l'oggetto creato
sia equivalente ad un oggetto creato in tutto e per tutto da voi e questa
possibilità si traduce nelle scelte, oltre che del tessuto, del filo utilizzato
per il ricamo e le cuciture, del layout, del disegno e della parola (o parole)
che si vorranno ricamare su di questo.


Anche per i fili è stata dedicata tutta l'attenzione e la
ricerca utilizzata per i tessuti ed il risultato è una varietà di filati
differenti per colori e caratteristiche.


Tra tutte le caratteristiche tenute in considerazione e
vagliate durante la fase di progetto una è degna di nota, la fosforescenza (da
non confondere con la fluorescenza).


Sì... Qualora lo si volesse si potrà scegliere tra ben quattro
(4) colori che inizieranno a brillare al calar del buio.






Essendo il nostro motto, “Larga varietà di scelta!”, anche questa
caratteristica è sceglibile.


I colori sono quelli visibili nelle immagini e nel momento in
cui si elencheranno le caratteristiche volute si potrà decidere il colore (9 varianti) e la
sua eventuale fosforescenza (tranne il nero, presente solo in colorazione NON
fosforescente).


Questi fili come detto servono per ricamare disegni e scritte
in base al layout scelto poiché “l'impaginazione” è qualcosa di molto personale
che dice molto di noi ed il cui risultato è fondamentale per la soddisfazione
di chi crea.


Le scelte disponibili sono mostrate in figura e sono
addirittura cinque (5).


I primi tre layout permettono la scrittura di Nomi, Nomi e
Cognomi, Pseudonimi e brevi frasi, fino ad un massimo di venti (20) caratteri.


Il quarto da la possibilità di inserire un disegno (che per
motivi di spazio sarà un po' più piccolo di quello sceglibile con il quinto
layout) ed una scritta formata da cinque (5) caratteri.


Il quinto layout invece utilizza tutta la superficie
disponibile per realizzare uno dei sette (7) disegni tra cui è possibile
scegliere.


    
  


Naturalmente una scritta, un nome, uno pseudonimo sono molto
personali, anzi unici, ma abbiamo ritenuto che questo non potesse bastare e
volendo realizzare l’unicità e l’assolutamente personale, abbiamo pensato ad
un’ulteriore possibilità, la scelta di un carattere tra ben sei (6)
combinazioni.
In fondo, ogni volta che apponiamo la nostra firma, in realtà
stendiamo il nostro vissuto e la nostra personalità, cosa che i grafologi
studiano, analizzano ed esaminano da moltissimo tempo; e dare la possibilità di
scegliere un carattere, ci permette di dare sfogo anche se in maniera
leggermente più limitata rispetto ad una firma, di quel che ci appartiene, che
è insito in noi e che è giusto sia parte integrante dell’oggetto unico e di
grande valore che si vorrebbe realizzare.
Inoltre come anticipato in base al layout scelto si potrebbe
scegliere anche un disegno tra quelli disponibili, le cui realizzazioni sono
visibili nelle immagini e che sono stati realizzati cercando di portare a
termine la miglior fusione possibile tra classico e moderno ricercando in
ognuno di essi la particolarità artistica in grado di renderlo unico e
differente da tutti gli altri.







Cedendo alle tentazioni ingegneristiche le combinazioni
possibili date da tutti gli elementi su cui è possibile scegliere sono
12 * 9 * 5 * 7 * 6 * 3 = 68.040 alle quali si aggiunge la personalizzazione estrema della
scritta indicata e decisa da voi.
Però, non ci siamo fermati qui.
Il vostro portasmartphone non deve essere solo bello e
personale, deve essere anche funzionale, quindi non ci siamo limitati alla
scelta dei giusti tessuti al fine di renderlo versatile e comodo rendendolo
capace di resistere al tempo, all’usura, agli sforzi, all'acqua ed al fuoco, ma
abbiamo fatto un grande studio per renderlo quanto più ergonomico e comodo
possibile.
Il modello prevede la possibilità di essere portato a
cintura, cosa molto, molto difficile per uno smartphone di grandi dimensioni, è
stato dunque necessario trovare una soluzione per renderlo comodo e fruibile.
Smartphone e portasmartphone, grazie allo studio della forma
di quest'ultimo non sono invalidanti.
Il tutto è sempre comodo, sia
stando in piedi che seduti o addirittura sdraiati, su qualunque superficie
(sedie, divani, letti, sedili di automobili, autobus, treni o aerei).
In più è possibile portarlo a tracolla, è possibile
utilizzarlo come aggancio per il portachiavi, il portamonete, il porta
auricolari etc... etc...



E già, avendo pensato di realizzare qualcosa che dovesse essere
il massimo, abbiamo ritenuto necessario andare oltre, rendendo disponibili
accessori unici ma dando la possibilità di sceglierli come optional.


Nello specifico si è voluto dare la possibilità a chiunque lo
desiderasse di rendere ancora più pratico il portasmartphone dando a questo
maggiore versatilità e rendendolo capace di interfacciarsi proponendosi come
supporto per elementi aggiuntivi grazie ai quali rendere ancora più unica e
piacevole l’esperienza del suo possesso.


Il modello base prevede l’attacco a cintura, ma si può volere
di più.


E’ possibile avere due pratici occhielli ai quali collegare
un portachiavi, un moschettone, una chiavetta usb, etc… etc…, così come è
possibile utilizzarli per inserirci una biro o un qual si voglia oggetto dalla
forma affusolata.
Inoltre, si può volere ancora
di più, si può volere una tracolla, grazie alla quale portare il
portasmartphone attraverso questa anziché alla cintura.
Al fine di renderne possibile l'utilizzo nelle più svariate situazioni (quando si praticano i nostri sport preferiti, quando si cammina, quando si corre, quando ci si riposa), la tracolla è regolabile in lunghezza, su una larghissima escursione.





Ma siamo andati oltre, dando la possibilità di avere anche
una pratica bustina realizzata nel medesimo tessuto con cui sarà realizzato il
portasmartphone che potrà essere utilizzata in base alle proprie esigenze (es.
porta auricolari, porta monete, porta chiavette usb, etc… etc…).
Ed infine, non potevamo non pensare alla realizzazione di un
portachiavi, anch’esso realizzato con lo stesso tessuto del portasmartphone,
cucito con il medesimo filo e che in base ai propri gusti, necessità o scelte,
potrà essere anche attaccato al portasmartphone stesso tramite gli occhielli
prima menzionati (esattamente come la bustina e la tracolla), o semplicemente
tenuto in tasca, in borsa o dove si è più comodi.
Tutte le qualità e le possibilità elencate finora fanno sì
che questo oggetto non abbia una connotazione, un inquadramento o uno specifico
target, ma queste caratteristiche sono tali da renderlo un oggetto indicato e
disponibile per chiunque poiché questo portasmartphone non ha una connotazione
sportiva o elegante, non ha come target i giovani o gli adulti, gli
appassionati di moda o gli appassionati di praticità.
Questo portasmartphone è espressione di chi lo possiede ed è
proprio l’espressione di sé che lo renderà il più affine possibile a noi,
facendolo divenire esattamente come lo si vorrà.
Infatti, attraverso la scelta del tessuto, del layout, del
filo, del ricamo, dei possibili gadget, questo oggetto potrà essere elegante,
sportivo, di classe, casual, alla moda, pratico, fashion, etc… etc… 

Ad oggi non esiste un elemento in grado di tutto ciò,
solamente questa nostra idea prevede la realizzazione di un qualcosa così
personalizzabile, così modulabile, così comodo, così di qualità, così unico...
Unico, come chi lo possiede.Tutti i prodotti sono realizzati in Italia, con la cura, la qualità, l'eleganza e la tradizione manifatturiera che il ""Made in Italy"" garantisce.Ma... Esistono diverse misure di smartphone, così... abbiamo creato tre misure tra cui scegliere.Se il vostro smartphone ha un'altezza compresa tra 105 mm (4,13'') e 125 mm (4,92'') potete scegliere la misura 1.Se il vostro smartphone ha un'altezza compresa tra 125 mm (4,92'') e 145 mm (5,71'') potete scegliere la misura 2.

Hi Everyone,
I´m Camilo Jaramillo, founder @ FOKUS GREEN.
Since I was a kid, my passion has always been enjoying the nature. Unfortunately, I have witnessed how humanity ends with the resources of our planet and always asked myself what could i do about it...

The Santa Maria is my opportunity to provide trendsetters not just another watch in their collection, but a piece of an experience that reflects the unique beauty of the outdoors in everyday life.

 The Santa Maria is an automatic watch with a dial made of basalt rocks from the Santa Maria volcano in Guatemala 

40mm brushed stainless steel caseSEIKO NH35 automatic movement3 ATM water resistanceDouble domed hesalite crystal with AR coatingPolished basalt rock dial Open case backEngraved rotorGenuine leather strapSuperluminova markers and hands Sure, climbing up the active volcano Santa Maria in Guatemala was a bit tricky. I admit, the elevation of 12,000 feet had both my legs and lungs burning and I was dripping with perspiration. I’d been living (read: adventuring) in Guatemala for about twenty years now and knew the Santa Maria volcano was a must-see, and the view and journey were worth it. But when I journeyed to the top of the volcano with a determined spirit, I scrambled back down with a backpack and pockets stuffed with volcanic basalt and an idea. And like every adventure, the beauty and the experience were worth the hard work.That’s what the Igneous Santa Maria watch is all about...a piece that not only tells time but tells a story. Each polished piece of volcanic basalt gathered from the Santa Maria volcano used for the dials is one-of-a-kind. With flecks of silica, iron and magnesium marbling the deep black base color, every sliver used has its own unique pattern. No two Igneous Santa Maria watches will be the same. The colors made by nature are showcased by a delicate cutting and polishing process and complemented by a 40mm brushed stainless steel casing for the perfectly sized watch. No bulky or clunky metal to hinder your adventuring, no straining to see the time. The brushed steel gives an understated feel that allows the colors of the volcanic rock dial to truly shine.Powering this rugged and unique exterior is SEIKO NH35 automatic movement, a reliable workhorse to keep this piece going through all of your adventures. It’s even water resistant up to 3 atm (30 meters). Lumed markers and hands allow for accurate time-telling even late into the night. After all, your adventures don’t stop when the sun goes down, so neither should you.The Santa Maria watch is made for style but also with comfort in mind. The genuine leather strap comes in either a brown or black option and offers both a classic explorer look and feel.The basalt rock face can be worn with any color and was crafted to be dressed up for a night out on the town or a night spent beneath the stars. The double-domed hesalite crystal with AR coating perfectly complements the natural beauty of the basalt dial, adding a retro touch that is made fresh and novel by the uniqueness of the volcanic rock. The open case back shows off the beautiful and precise craftsmanship that powers the piece. It also exhibits one of my favorite details: an engraving of the Santa Maria volcano on the rotor, a private reminder that life is meant to be an adventure and that beauty is meant to be shared.The watch comes with an engraved wooden box for storage and a leather pouch for protection during the most rugged of adventures. A small raw basalt rock from the Santa Maria volcano is included to give you a taste of where your Igneous timepiece started.My two passions are merged in this piece: a love of the outdoors, especially hiking, and my desire to make beautiful and affordable high-quality pieces. Incorporating the beauty of the place I call home and such a unique landscape is what really spurred me forward and inspired me to design this piece. How many people own a piece of a volcano? The Santa Maria is my opportunity to provide trendsetters not just another watch in their collection, but a piece of an experience that reflects the unique beauty of the outdoors in everyday life. It’s for the intrepid explorers who enjoy the journey as much as the destination and take comfort in knowing that whatever adventure comes their way, they’ll always look great doing it. The price of the watch starts at only $199 for the first 100 orders. Start your own adventure-filled journey with the Igneous Santa Maria watch. Trust us, the view of the watch is worth it, too. Santa Maria VolcanoLocation: GuatemalaCoordinates: 10.463N, 91.552WElevation: 3,772m (12,375 ft)Type: StratovolcanoLast Eruption: Ongoing8 hour hike to summit  The basalt rocks I found at the Santa Maria have a very deep black color and are rich in silica, iron and magnesium.

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b>Q  - What inTie differs from other ties?</b></p>A: From an aestethic point of view inTie is a normal tie of high quality, but in the back was a patented microfibre stylish pocket that lets you wear inTie and leave your wallet at home!<p><b>Q - What materials are the ties?</b></p>A: The ties are all made of Italian silk of the highest quality.<div>
<p><b>Q -Where are they produced?</b></p>
<p>A: All the inTie ties are exclusively manufactured in Italy. Our most distinctive peculiarity is handmade at all stages of production.</p>
<p><b>Q - The pocket does not change the look of the tie?</b></p>
<p>A: NO. inTie is, aesthetically, a tie of first quality. The pocket is an element that does not damage the quality of the tie at all, in fact, enhances it, giving it that extra requisite than other ties haven’t.</p>
<p><b>Q - If I flip over the tie there is a risk of losing the contents?</b></p>A: NO. The study of the materials  has led us to achieve pockets in ""Alcantara"" just to create friction with the content and make it impossible for the loss.<br/><p><b>Q - The product has been tested?</b></p>A: YES. After nearly six months of tests on the tie we got the absolute certainty that it is virtually impossible to steal or misplace cards, banknotes or any content placed inside the pocket.<br/><p><b>Q - What size have ties?</b></p>
<p>A: Length 57” 145 cm</p>
<p>Width 3.25” 8 cm</p>
<p><b>Q - When Arrive ties?</b></p>
<p>A: The ties will be sent a month after the end of the campaign on indiegogo. All this time is necessary because every tie is handcrafted by expert tailors. Each tie is unique and numbered, just like a work of art.</p>
<p><b>Q - I Do not use the tie, why should I buy it?</b></p>
<p>inTie could be also an original gift, so in the shipping it’s also included a package that it’s up to the tie.</p>
<p>A first-class gift to impress the recipient.</p>

<br/><br/><h1>OUR STORY</h1>
<br/><p>Hi, I’m Giuseppe</p>
<p>I always wear ties for work. <b>I had this idea after a night when I was robbed on the subway without even noticing</b>. The day after the theft, <b>I looked for a place to hide notes and documents in order to leave wallet at home, but it had to be a safe place</b>, so I involved my brother and we started this project.</p>
<p>So <b>we combined the tradition and the quality of made in Italy products</b> <i>(handmade ties with the best Italian silk) </i>with a useful and stylish part as the inner pocket, <b>giving it that extra requisite than other ties haven’t</b>, thus making inTie not only elegant but also useful tie !</p>
<p><b>With inTie you can keep the credit card, a document, a few notes and leave your wallet at home !</b></p>
<p>We offer a product exclusively ""<b>Made in Italy</b>"", manufactured with Italian silk of the highest quality. inTie is entirely hand made at all stages of processing.</p>
<p>We've spent the last year preparing for this campaign: sourcing materials, vetting suppliers, developing our brand and designing our collection.</p>
<p>Due to the initial costs and minimum order quantities high in the production of our ties, <b>we need your support to enable us to start our first production.</b></p>
<p><b>To reach as many people as possible we ask you to involve your friends, family and all the people who can help us in the sharing of the campaign on indiegogo.</b></p>
<p><b>THANK YOU</b></p>

<p><b>D -Cosa differenzia inTie dalle altre cravatte?</b></p>
<p><i>R: Esteticamente inTie è una normalissima cravatta

una elegante tasca in microfibra  che ti consente di indossare inTie e lasciare a casa il portafoglio !</i></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><span>D -Di quale materiale sono le cravatte?</span></b></p>

<p><i><b><span>D -Dove sono prodotte?</span></b></i></p>

di prima qualità.Il
taschino è un elemento che non rovina
affatto la qualità della cravatta, anzi,la esalta, conferendole quell’elemento
in più che le altre cravatte non
hanno.</i></p>
<p><b><span>D -Se capovolgo la cravatta non rischio di perdere il contenuto?</span></b></p>
<p><i>R: NO. Lo studio dei materiali ci ha portato a realizzare
le tasche in ""Alcantara"" proprio per creare attrito con il

<h1><span>La Nostra Storia</span></h1>

<p>Ciao, sono Giuseppe ed uso
la cravatta per andare a lavoro. L’idea mi è venuta una sera dopo essere stato
derubato in metropolitana senza che me ne fossi accorto. I giorni successivi al
furto cercavo un posto dove nascondere banconote e documenti in modo da lasciare
a casa il portafoglio, ma doveva essere un posto sicuro e pratico, allora
ho coinvolto mio fratello ed abbiamo iniziato questo progetto.</p>
<p>Con inTie puoi inserire
un documento, la carta di credito e le banconote e lasciare a casa il
portafogli!</p>
<p>Abbiamo <b>unito la tradizione e la qualità dei
prodotti Made in Italy</b>, offrendo cravatte interamente <b>fatte a mano con la migliore seta italiana</b>, <b>ad un elemento utile ed elegante</b> come il taschino interno alla
struttura che esalta la qualità del prodotto finale, conferendole
quell’elemento in più che le altre cravatte non hanno, <b>rendendo di fatto inTie una cravatta non
solo elegante ma anche utile!</b></p>
<p>Abbiamo trascorso <b>l'ultimo anno per preparare questa campagna</b>: approvvigionamento
materiali, vagliare i fornitori, sviluppare il nostro marchio e progettare la
nostra collezione. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>A causa dei costi
iniziali e quantitativi minimi di ordine elevato nella produzione delle nostre
cravatte, <b>abbiamo bisogno del vostro sostegno </b>per permetterci di

The study of the materials  has led us to achieve pockets in ""Alcantara"" just to create friction with the content and make it impossible for the loss.Q - The product has been tested?A: YES. After nearly six months of tests on the tie we got the absolute certainty that it is virtually impossible to steal or misplace cards, banknotes or any content placed inside the pocket.Q - What size have ties?
A: Length 57” 145 cm
Width 3.25” 8 cm
Q - When Arrive ties?
A: The ties will be sent a month after the end of the campaign on indiegogo. All this time is necessary because every tie is handcrafted by expert tailors. Each tie is unique and numbered, just like a work of art.
Q - I Do not use the tie, why should I buy it?
inTie could be also an original gift, so in the shipping it’s also included a package that it’s up to the tie.
A first-class gift to impress the recipient.
We'll send you an email after you order to confirm your selection of items and We'll update you frequently about our progress.
If you have any question or concern, please shoot us an email at info@intie.it and we will answer as soon as possible!
OUR STORY
Hi, I’m Giuseppe
I always wear ties for work. I had this idea after a night when I was robbed on the subway without even noticing. The day after the theft, I looked for a place to hide notes and documents in order to leave wallet at home, but it had to be a safe place, so I involved my brother and we started this project.
So we combined the tradition and the quality of made in Italy products (handmade ties with the best Italian silk) with a useful and stylish part as the inner pocket, giving it that extra requisite than other ties haven’t, thus making inTie not only elegant but also useful tie !
With inTie you can keep the credit card, a document, a few notes and leave your wallet at home !
We offer a product exclusively ""Made in Italy"", manufactured with Italian silk of the highest quality. inTie is entirely hand made at all stages of processing.
We've spent the last year preparing for this campaign: sourcing materials, vetting suppliers, developing our brand and designing our collection.
Due to the initial costs and minimum order quantities high in the production of our ties, we need your support to enable us to start our first production.
To reach as many people as possible we ask you to involve your friends, family and all the people who can help us in the sharing of the campaign on indiegogo.
THANK YOU

La Nostra Storia

Ciao, sono Giuseppe ed uso
la cravatta per andare a lavoro. L’idea mi è venuta una sera dopo essere stato
derubato in metropolitana senza che me ne fossi accorto. I giorni successivi al
furto cercavo un posto dove nascondere banconote e documenti in modo da lasciare
a casa il portafoglio, ma doveva essere un posto sicuro e pratico, allora
ho coinvolto mio fratello ed abbiamo iniziato questo progetto.
Con inTie puoi inserire
un documento, la carta di credito e le banconote e lasciare a casa il
portafogli!
Abbiamo unito la tradizione e la qualità dei
prodotti Made in Italy, offrendo cravatte interamente fatte a mano con la migliore seta italiana, ad un elemento utile ed elegante come il taschino interno alla
struttura che esalta la qualità del prodotto finale, conferendole
quell’elemento in più che le altre cravatte non hanno, rendendo di fatto inTie una cravatta non
solo elegante ma anche utile!
Abbiamo trascorso l'ultimo anno per preparare questa campagna: approvvigionamento
materiali, vagliare i fornitori, sviluppare il nostro marchio e progettare la
nostra collezione. 

A causa dei costi
iniziali e quantitativi minimi di ordine elevato nella produzione delle nostre
cravatte, abbiamo bisogno del vostro sostegno per permetterci di
iniziare la nostra prima produzione.
Per raggiungere il
maggior numero di persone possibili ti chiediamo di coinvolgere i tuoi amici,
familiari e tutte le persone in grado di aiutarci nella condivisione della
campagna su indiegogo.
Le cravatte inTie hanno
bisogno di te!Grazie

<div>It is important to realise that as this is a fixed campaign, we do not receive any funds from it unless our goal is met. This means watch production will not begin until our goal is met and we receive the funds.

Underneath its simplicity, this watch carries a complex mechanism which transforms into a highly sophisticated self-winding system. Enable the watch to run on itself as a result of natural motion of the wearer's arm, making manual winding or battery replacement unnecessary. A watch movement which only found in luxury watches and expensive timepieces.The name Obelisc is inspired by obelisk, an icon symbolizing the most fundamental and ancient time measuring system, the sun dial.To achieve the goal, we sincerely need your pledge and support. Big or small perks mean a lot to us. SpecsCase Diameter: 40 mmCase Thickness: 11 mmStrap Width: 20mmJapan Miyota Cal. 8205 Automatic MovementSapphire Crystal (scratch resistant)Solid Stainless Steel 316L Case and Caseback5 ATM (50 m) Water ResistanceGenuine Strap with Leather BackingHow do i get this watch?

I love to read stories but I do not like cooking or helping with household chores, which is what Pakistani society expects a girl to do. I do not have enough time to play after school because I have to help my mother with chores. My father is a shopkeeper and my favorite subject is math. My biggest challenge in life is that I belong to a family where educating a girl is not considered important. None of my cousins are in school.

<p><b>The
question is legitimate. Why buy a GPS sport watch instead of just download an
application ?</b></p>

answer, everyone does not want to be burdened by a phone during workout. Of
course it is possible to store it in a pocket or use an armband, but this is
clearly not what is the most comfortable for a long run.</li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Also, a <b><span style=""color: rgba(255,100,0,1);"">Smartphone screen is mostly illegible</span></b>, the moisture invades the armband quickly, it is
almost impossible to control the application because the touch screen function
provides erratic and random behavior. Not to mention the weather conditions
that may put a strain on the Smartphone while our watch does not fear the
elements.</p></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b><span style=""color: rgba(255,100,0,1);"">Moreover,
thesportGPS watch has the great advantage of being worn on the wrist and
therefore information could be watched easily even during exercise.</span></b><br/>And that's
may be the main benefit in comparison to an application whose interest is
frankly more to post-analyze a workout session. Besides, use a GPS sport watch
keeps your hands free, <b><span style=""color: rgba(255,100,0,1);"">the key metrics on the screen are readable even in
bright sunlight</span></b> and the watch parameters setup is easily accessible at any
time. </li>
<li>We may also mention the <b><span style=""color: rgba(255,100,0,1);"">vocal coach</span></b>,<b> it allows to receive performance
information while listening to the music</b> without even having to look at the
watch screen. Last but not least argument for the watch dedicated to runners is
its ability to offer a long battery operation time rather than an application
that drains quickly the Smartphone battery by the extensive use of GPS.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<b> </b><p> </p>We have <b>fully functional prototypes</b> of theSportGPS and we have a team of smart engineers in USA and in South Korea - who are working around the clock to ensure that we can build a great product and deliver it on time. However, like many crowdfunding projects, there are a number of risks and challenges that we need to mitigate before we can get theSportGPS to each one of you. We would like to keep you informed of these potential pitfalls and what we are doing to circumvent them. As our early supporters already know, we have postponed our crowdfunding campaign for some months because we wanted to be really ready and don't reproduce what unfortunately many other companies did because of products not well designed and developed.<br/><br/><p>                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456278954/u0x5gvlghzz0t8o3mmym.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 465px; height: 465px;""/></p>
<br/>First off, there are risks associated with the manufacturing of any hardware product. A tremendous amount of effort will be expended to ensure that the assembly line can produce theSportGPS reliably. Fortunately, we have forged great working and personal relationships with our manufacturing partners to ensure that the manufacturing process will happen smoothly.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456284533/f4q0tiqpef0px7mkpl9v.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Secondly, there are risks associated with the logistics to physically deliver theSportGPS to you.

<h1>FAQ<br/>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<article>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Who is this product made for?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        The sport GPS is a watch made with outdoor sports needs in mind. It will help you to see your performance while training and give you all the tools to see your progress. You will also be able to upload your results into all the popular exercise tracking web applications so you can share and compare with others. Your complete workout history is kept inside the device.<br/>The Sport GPS will also make your workouts more pleasant with its unique music player using a standard earphone connector. In this configuration you will also enjoy hearing your progress through the voice of the built-in coach.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Why should I use it?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        The Sport GPS gives you a comprehensive picture of your sport activities during and after your workouts by keeping all your history.<br/>By listening to your favorite music while training, it will be more pleasant to go longer and farther.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>How is the sport GPS is better than a smartwatch like the recent Apple Watch or Samsung smartwatch for outdoor sports?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        The question is more, would you like to take your expensive, fragile and bulky smartphone with you while exercising?<br/>Apple Watch and other smartwatches are smartphone ""slaves"". They are not able to work if they are not connected to your smartphone.<br/>The Sport GPS is an autonomous GPS sport watch and MP3 player that needs nothing but itself to give you all the information you desire in order to see what you accomplished in your workout. Train with music using standard earphones through the 3.5mm connector.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Is TheSportGPS a fitness tracker?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        Fitness trackers on the market today are just evolved cousins of the pedometers from yesteryear.<br/>Though they could be used even inside buildings, they are not providing really accurate measurerements for outdoor workouts. Many of them need a companion application running on a smartphone or a Web site to give you performance figures, whereas TheSportGPS is fully autonomous and provides much more accurate results.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Does it count steps?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        No, it actually measures your real distance using much more accurate GPS Technology.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Where can I buy it?</h3>
<div>
<p>The first items will be made available through a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo starting February 24th 2016.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Isn't it not too big for my wrist? (What are the dimensions?)</h3>
<div>
<p>It's a really tiny and light product. (35x64x13mm)</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>I use Runtastic, Strava, MapMyRun... on my iPhone today, how easily can I switch to using TheSportsGPS?</h3>
<div>
<p>Very easily. All your workout data files are exportable as GPS Exchange Format (.GPX) or TCX files. This format is fully supported by all applications such as Runtastic, Strava, Runkeeper and so on.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Can I read the screen in sunlight?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        Yes, this is one of the key features of the sport GPS together with the POI map and the MP3 player. Our screen technology offers even better visibility in sunlight in comparison to other commonly used display technologies.<br/>This makes a big difference when you compare our sport watch with a smartphone or many other sport devices that have, hard to read screens in sunlight.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>What data does TheSportGPS show?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        The Sport GPS shows : Time, Duration, Distance, Speed and Pace (instant, maximum and average), Calories, Lap, Goal, Elevation, Latitude, Longitude, POI map and Position... all in Imperial or Metric.<br/>Most of the displayed information can also be heard through the voice coach.<br/>The sport GPS watch has four screen layouts - one for the chronometer data, a second one for the music player, and one for Historical data, and finally, one for the key user rules setup.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Can I customize what data is displayed on the screen?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        Between all the information provided by the Sport GPS you can select which one you want to see and in which order. You can also decide which ones to receive voice messages for simply by using the ""TheSportGPS"" user tools software on a PC with MS Windows. (Mac OS support in preparation)
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Many sport watches have a touchscreen and The Sport GPS has six buttons, Why?
                        </h3>
<div>
<p>
                        As an outdoor device, The Sport GPS should be fully functional even if your fingers are sweaty or when it is rainy.<br/>Touch screens don't work correctly in such conditions. That's why we have designed the sport GPS with six buttons and a TAP action User Interface.<br/>Navigation between screens and functions are as easy as up-down / left-right / start-stop / okay-cancel actions.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Does TheSportGPS have a backlight in order to be usable for night workout?
                        </h3>
<div>
<p>
                        Yes. TheSportGPS has a bright sunlight display and has a backlight for your night time workouts.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>What music formats can it play?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        The sport GPS music player supports WAVE (.wav) and MPEG Layer 3 (.mp3) file formats. (and soon we will add other formats like Advanced Audio Coding (.AAC)
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>How many songs can I store on it?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        You could store as many songs as your Sport GPS is able to store in its SD-card memory up to as huge as 65,535 music files.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Is it easy to change music?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        To import music into the Sport GPS you just have to ""drag and drop"" on the Sport GPS flash disk. And like any other files, paste or delete to add or remove a song in your sport watch.
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Can I change the language of the voice messages?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        The first ready product will be delivered with English voice messages and interface. Quickly after, the sport GPS will support a large set of languages with a simple update of The Sport GPS watch's internal software
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>Does it have a map built-in?</h3>
<div>
<p>
                        Not a map as in a navigation product. But, using our user tools you could create POIs on a Google style map and create a track. That POIs and track will be visible on your screen at the same time of your current geographical position. And you can still use the GPS to find your direction to ""home"".
                        </p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h3>How accurate is the GPS?</h3>

We assure you that we are fully ready and experienced. We have chosen a fixed amount that is dimensioned to be able to fulfill all the stages of the production process. Moreover, even if theSportGPS campaign and product were ready, we have postponed our campaign during more than 8 months in order to double check all the stages. We are waiting to receive your support and ready to give you back a great sport watch.theSportGPS will free you from your smartphone during workout.


GPS powered multi-sports chronometer watch




Music Player (MP3) with standard mini-jack earphones




Voice coaching messages (while listening to your music !)



Autonomous (you don't need to bring your smartphone)





POI map + tracking + workout history




Sunlight readable screen + water resistant





theSportGPS watch rather than an application?
The
question is legitimate. Why buy a GPS sport watch instead of just download an
application ?
First
answer, everyone does not want to be burdened by a phone during workout. Of
course it is possible to store it in a pocket or use an armband, but this is
clearly not what is the most comfortable for a long run.
Also, a Smartphone screen is mostly illegible, the moisture invades the armband quickly, it is
almost impossible to control the application because the touch screen function
provides erratic and random behavior. Not to mention the weather conditions
that may put a strain on the Smartphone while our watch does not fear the
elements.


Moreover,
thesportGPS watch has the great advantage of being worn on the wrist and
therefore information could be watched easily even during exercise.And that's
may be the main benefit in comparison to an application whose interest is
frankly more to post-analyze a workout session. Besides, use a GPS sport watch
keeps your hands free, the key metrics on the screen are readable even in
bright sunlight and the watch parameters setup is easily accessible at any
time. 
We may also mention the vocal coach, it allows to receive performance
information while listening to the music without even having to look at the
watch screen. Last but not least argument for the watch dedicated to runners is
its ability to offer a long battery operation time rather than an application
that drains quickly the Smartphone battery by the extensive use of GPS.




Workout in music!
Two
riders on three are training in music. Despite this, the music player function
is not available on the majority of runners' watches. Too bad for an accessory
that claims to rid you of your Smartphone during workout.

Only
theSportGPS has a large 16GB memory thus, it can store more than
2000 songs in MP3, more than enough for any running session. You have only to
connect earphones directly into the standard jack and voila, no need for
expensive Bluetooth earphones. If practicing sport with music and without a Smartphone is your main criterion, the choice is quickly made with theSportGPS that has no rival.little tip: theSportGPS can also be your flash drive to store your secret documents


Set a track and follow it with theSportGPS!

This
is one of the highlights of theSportGPS watch, the application that lets a user
configures the watch on a PC, also lets him to capture positions on a map and
so creates a track of points of interest which then will draw a visible path on
the screen of the watch along with the position of the athlete.theSportGPS companion software tool:A lot of options to customize your sport gps.

About
Us




theSportGPS team is a group of smart hardware and software engineers rich in energy and full of innovative spirit.
 The Company is based in USA and South Korea and have a long experience in the GPS devices industry.



Our software engineers have worked with complicated projects and businesses and had hands-on experience on the development of Sport GPS as well as in the automotive market.



Risks & Challenges

  We have fully functional prototypes of theSportGPS and we have a team of smart engineers in USA and in South Korea - who are working around the clock to ensure that we can build a great product and deliver it on time. However, like many crowdfunding projects, there are a number of risks and challenges that we need to mitigate before we can get theSportGPS to each one of you. We would like to keep you informed of these potential pitfalls and what we are doing to circumvent them. As our early supporters already know, we have postponed our crowdfunding campaign for some months because we wanted to be really ready and don't reproduce what unfortunately many other companies did because of products not well designed and developed.                
First off, there are risks associated with the manufacturing of any hardware product. A tremendous amount of effort will be expended to ensure that the assembly line can produce theSportGPS reliably. Fortunately, we have forged great working and personal relationships with our manufacturing partners to ensure that the manufacturing process will happen smoothly.Secondly, there are risks associated with the logistics to physically deliver theSportGPS to you. But, we assure you that we are prepared  with our fulfillment partners to ensure speedy and reliable delivery of theSportGPS into your hands.Last but not least, we want you to know this: what we value the most is our relationship with you, our supporters. As a result, you have our word that we will remain completely transparent and keep you in the loop every step of the way.

How is the sport GPS is better than a smartwatch like the recent Apple Watch or Samsung smartwatch for outdoor sports?


                        The question is more, would you like to take your expensive, fragile and bulky smartphone with you while exercising?Apple Watch and other smartwatches are smartphone ""slaves"". They are not able to work if they are not connected to your smartphone.The Sport GPS is an autonomous GPS sport watch and MP3 player that needs nothing but itself to give you all the information you desire in order to see what you accomplished in your workout. Train with music using standard earphones through the 3.5mm connector.
                        



Is TheSportGPS a fitness tracker?


                        Fitness trackers on the market today are just evolved cousins of the pedometers from yesteryear.Though they could be used even inside buildings, they are not providing really accurate measurerements for outdoor workouts. Many of them need a companion application running on a smartphone or a Web site to give you performance figures, whereas TheSportGPS is fully autonomous and provides much more accurate results.
                        



Does it count steps?


                        No, it actually measures your real distance using much more accurate GPS Technology.



Where can I buy it?

The first items will be made available through a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo starting February 24th 2016.



Isn't it not too big for my wrist? (What are the dimensions?)

It's a really tiny and light product. (35x64x13mm)



I use Runtastic, Strava, MapMyRun... on my iPhone today, how easily can I switch to using TheSportsGPS?

Very easily. All your workout data files are exportable as GPS Exchange Format (.GPX) or TCX files. This format is fully supported by all applications such as Runtastic, Strava, Runkeeper and so on.
                        



Can I read the screen in sunlight?


                        Yes, this is one of the key features of the sport GPS together with the POI map and the MP3 player. Our screen technology offers even better visibility in sunlight in comparison to other commonly used display technologies.This makes a big difference when you compare our sport watch with a smartphone or many other sport devices that have, hard to read screens in sunlight.
                        



What data does TheSportGPS show?


                        The Sport GPS shows : Time, Duration, Distance, Speed and Pace (instant, maximum and average), Calories, Lap, Goal, Elevation, Latitude, Longitude, POI map and Position... all in Imperial or Metric.Most of the displayed information can also be heard through the voice coach.The sport GPS watch has four screen layouts - one for the chronometer data, a second one for the music player, and one for Historical data, and finally, one for the key user rules setup.
                        



Can I customize what data is displayed on the screen?


                        Between all the information provided by the Sport GPS you can select which one you want to see and in which order. You can also decide which ones to receive voice messages for simply by using the ""TheSportGPS"" user tools software on a PC with MS Windows. (Mac OS support in preparation)
                        



Many sport watches have a touchscreen and The Sport GPS has six buttons, Why?
                        


                        As an outdoor device, The Sport GPS should be fully functional even if your fingers are sweaty or when it is rainy.Touch screens don't work correctly in such conditions. That's why we have designed the sport GPS with six buttons and a TAP action User Interface.Navigation between screens and functions are as easy as up-down / left-right / start-stop / okay-cancel actions.
                        



Does TheSportGPS have a backlight in order to be usable for night workout?
                        


                        Yes. TheSportGPS has a bright sunlight display and has a backlight for your night time workouts.
                        



What music formats can it play?


                        The sport GPS music player supports WAVE (.wav) and MPEG Layer 3 (.mp3) file formats. (and soon we will add other formats like Advanced Audio Coding (.AAC)
                        



How many songs can I store on it?


                        You could store as many songs as your Sport GPS is able to store in its SD-card memory up to as huge as 65,535 music files.
                        



Is it easy to change music?


                        To import music into the Sport GPS you just have to ""drag and drop"" on the Sport GPS flash disk. And like any other files, paste or delete to add or remove a song in your sport watch.
                        



Can I change the language of the voice messages?


                        The first ready product will be delivered with English voice messages and interface. Quickly after, the sport GPS will support a large set of languages with a simple update of The Sport GPS watch's internal software
                        



Does it have a map built-in?


                        Not a map as in a navigation product. But, using our user tools you could create POIs on a Google style map and create a track. That POIs and track will be visible on your screen at the same time of your current geographical position. And you can still use the GPS to find your direction to ""home"".
                        



How accurate is the GPS?


                        Very accurate as the sport GPS watch uses the latest GPS technologies such as multiconstellation coverage and A-GPS. Of course, as with any GPS device you should have a view of the sky to be able to receive the satellites' signal.

Brasure combines masculine and feminine pleasure!
IT'S UP TO YOU TO DO THE REST !

                                            
• "" We used Brasure during one of our date nights and my girlfriend suprised me with it. I noticed her cleavage was gorgeous, but I wasn't aware why. During the meal, she confessed to what she was wearing and I admit I was in a hurry to get home.. The following part lived up to our expectations.""•""I suggested to my boyfriend to try out Brasure, explaining what it was. He automatically was into it. I did a strip-tease in front of him to start the evening off, then we got closer. The game with the bra came naturally and very sensually, nothing forced. We discussed afterwards and we both agreed it was a wonderful moment of shared pleasure and excitement.""•""We had heard of Brasure, we were in search of new experiences. So it was natural that we tried. We had a lot of fun. It was a very entertaining experience.  The feelings were very intense, but mostly we felt very close.""          Nico and Engue, two ambitious Montpelliérains invented the concept of Brasure, and it has now been a year since they began working on it.Based respectively on experiences and concrete studies, Brasure is born and grows primarily to the total satisfaction of its users.Creators of the first bra / sextoy, Nicolas and Enguerrand are now proud to offer a set of lingerie already produced and carefully designed. They rely on you for the adventure to continue! 

 
  
          
  
 

 
Brasure est le premier soutien gorge au monde dans lequel est intégré un sextoy. Il permet de pratiquer de manière optimale la mazophallation (technique de masturbation du pénis entre les seins)...


Grâce à un guide placé entre les bonnets du soutien-gorge, vous et votre partenaire n'aurez plus besoin de maintenir la verge ou les seins dans la bonne position... Puisque Brasure le fait pour vous !!!

Poitrines petites, moyennes ou généreuses, Brasure s'adapte à toutes les morphologies féminines... Et toutes les morphologies masculines !



Réalisé à partir de matériaux haut de gamme, il a été dessiné selon le savoir-faire historique français en matière de lingerie. Un véritable ensemble de lingerie qui sublimera les formes de votre partenaire !​

Son design est étudié pour un effet ultra push-up (même sur les petites poitrines) et procure un décolleté extraordinaire. Un effet qui vous permettra aussi une meilleure pratique de la mazophallation... 

Brasure se porte dans toutes les situations, et sous tous types de vêtements. Un confort digne des lingeries haute couture ! Le guide quant à lui, est invisible sous les vêtements et s'intègre parfaitement au soutien gorge.​

Le guide (permettant de maintenir la verge) est équipé d'un dispositif recouvert d'un matériau glissant et élastique totalement hypoallergénique. Il permet ainsi une excellente glisse !!! Le système a été breveté et testé. Pour votre plus grand plaisir ... 



Brasure relève le défi de pimenter votre vie sexuelle en vous permettant de pratiquer la mazophallation dans les meilleures conditions. Vous n'aurez plus besoin de vous servir de vos mains... Et votre imagination fera le reste !

Brasure combine un ensemble de lingerie fine et un sextoy ! Brasure coûte  2 fois moins cher qu'un ensemble de lingerie et un sextoy ! Pour autant d'effet !




L'homme et la femme y trouveront des sensations différentes mais toutes autant délicieuses. 
Brasure mettra en valeur les poitrines de la plus belle manière et ce pour le plus grand plaisir des messieurs. Ce décolleté avantageux sera la promesse, mesdames, de caresses intimes qui rendront fou votre partenaire...
Et parce que la mazophallation se pratique toujours à deux, nous ne parlons plus ici d'une simple masturbation de l'homme entre les seins de sa partenaire, mais de sexe doux et de plaisirs respectifs. 
Sachez que pour certaines femmes la stimulation par les caresses de la poitrine provoque autant de plaisir que sur d'autres parties érogènes tel que le clitoris. 
Brasure combine le plaisir masculin et féminin! 
A VOUS DE JOUER POUR LE RESTE !


"" Nous avons utilisé Brasure lors d’une de nos date night et ma compagne m’avait fait la surprise. J’avais remarqué que son décolleté était magnifique, mais je n’étais pas au courant de ce que c’était. Lors du repas, elle m’a avoué ce qu’elle portait et j’avoue que j’étais très pressé de rentrer à la maison… La suite fut à la hauteur de nos espérances.""
""J’ai proposé à mon ami d’essayer Brasure, en lui expliquant ce que c’était. Il a tout de suite été emballé. J’ai réalisé un strip-tease devant lui pour bien démarrer la soirée, puis nous nous sommes rapprochés. Le jeu avec le soutien gorge est venu tout naturellement et de manière très sensuelle, pas du tout forcée. Nous en avons discuté après, nous sommes tous les deux d’accord, ce fut un moment merveilleux de plaisir partagé et très excitant. ""
""Nous avons entendu parler de Brasure, nous étions en quête de nouvelles expériences. C’est donc tout naturellement que nous avons essayé. Nous nous sommes beaucoup amusés. C’était très fun de rigoler avec cette nouvelle pratique. Les sensations étaient très intenses, mais surtout nous nous sommes sentis très proches.""

          

 
Nicolas & Enguerrand, deux Montpelliérains ambitieux, ont inventé le concept Brasure et voilà maintenant un an qu'ils y travaillent.
Se basant respectivement sur des expériences et des études concrètes, Brasure est né et évolue avant tout pour la satisfaction totale de ses utilisateurs-trices.
Créateurs du premier soutien-gorge sextoy, Nicolas et Enguerrand sont aujourd'hui fiers de vous proposer un produit abouti et soigneusement conçu. Ils comptent sur vous pour que l'aventure continue !

 





          
 
RISKS AND CHALENGES // RISQUES ET DÉFIS
Our team is composed of business leaders and experienced project managers.
They have already completed many successful projects.
The model proposed here was made with great care by a French expert for several decades. The parties in this project have already been identified, namely, raw material suppliers and converters for the manufacturing part.
For financing, communication, marketing parts we have attached ourselves to the services of a team :
- An expert in institutional funding
- An expert in crowdfunding
- A community manager
- A bank broker
- A business lawyer
- A specialised patent design office
We have funded all the work done so far. So we took all the risks, and we can already say that if you make this campaign a success we can provide counterparts within two months.
Suppliers and manufacturers  have been identified as existing international businesses for many years with solid reputations.
We are perfectionists and we have done our homework. Therefore the risk is minimal.
Brasure is already the subject of a patent, financed from our own funds.
What you see are the prototypes, you can expect that the final result is beyond your expectations in terms of quality, once passed by the manufacturing process.
This process has already been carefully prepared by our design office who has extensive experience in large-scale manufacturing lingerie models.
We must not forget that the purpose of such a creation is a large-scale manufacturing, everything was figured from the beginning for this.
We have worked with all the partners before and have set aside time for output and fulfillment. We have also gone through multiple prototypes and testing on the bra, and feel confident that the product we are presenting is one you will love.
We studied in detail the quantity that we can offer and at which prices, to be certain of being able to provide counterparts within the deadlines.

</div></div>","The story behind the equiMedpakHaving been around horses all my life I know the stress injured horses can cause their owners. Dealing with an injury quickly and efficiently can make all the difference, especially with a serious bleed.Through research of equine first aid kits on the market we believe there is  nothing that properly meets the modern horse owner's needs. This provided the inspiration for the equiMedPak.The equiMedpak has been specifically designed with the equestrian owner in mind; Simplicity, accessibility, practicality and cleanliness when dealing with an emergency.The equiMedPak designThe team have worked over for over a year on a succession of designs and prototypes for the pack. These started with the simple drawings below, to several working prototypes, refining and improving at every stage.Original drawings3D Designs ""equiMedpak"" Stages of developmentEvery owner's nightmare is the dreadful fear of suddenly finding their horse sick or injured either in a field, stable, in transit or even while out at a show and consequently having to take urgent action until the vet arrives. I am sure all equestrian owners can identify with exactly what I am talking about and know in the extreme emergencies time is of the essence which is why this specially designed backpack is fully kitted with all the emergency items, ensuring owners have everything they require. The design of the bag in itself gives users reassurance. Strong, durable and waterproof it safeguards the contents in the bag from the elements. Being a backpack it allows the user to carry the bag safely and with ease allowing hands to remain free, a real advantage if you're on your own and having to lead a horse to safety.The front pouch unzips and folds out revealing an array of strong storage solutions which hold our first aid items firmly in place, giving the user a clear view of the items on display with easy access to take them out and put back faster in the event of an emergency. This also ensures the items never get damaged or lost.The middle section of the bag holds more veterinary items and allows the user to add items of their own choice.Latest Prototype:Storage holders for all the important veterinary items

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Introducing MARTIE26</strong></u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Our journey began on a sunny day in <strong>Bucharest</strong>, <strong>Romania</strong>, in <strong>May</strong> <strong>2019</strong>. Our founder Massimo was sitting outside the National Museum of Romanian History. There was a guy out there who was telling tourists the story of the first King of Romania.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574955193/b77lxi5mnxgbcvcbiqf6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Carol 1st became king of Romania in 1881 after a long period of fights across the Nation</strong>. He had a crown, as every king has, but his one was different.</p>
<h2>He decided to use cast iron instead of gold.</h2>
<p>Why? Cause <u><strong>he decided to melt a cannon</strong></u> he got from a battle against the Ottomans, and he asked Romanian artisans to make a crown from that.</p>
<p><strong>While listening to that story Martie26 was born. Create beauty from tools made to hurt.</strong></p>
<p>Are you ready to listen to the full version? Seat down and relax.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Facts</h3>
<p><strong>Do you know? </strong>In the United States, <strong>it is equally likely to die in a car accident than to die killed by a bullet</strong>. Yep, think about how many traffic jams you have been in and consider the fact that you may have the same possibility to get into a shooting fight.</p>
<h3>In 2017 the victims of these two categories of events were in both cases around 40 thousand.</h3>
<p>Free firearms make far more deaths (Americans) than Washington's wars over the past 18 years. ""Accidental"" deaths from firearms between 1999 and 2017 are more than double the number of soldiers killed in the mission from 2001 to 2019 (the victims of firearms, overall, are more than 100 times as much).</p>
<p><strong>These are just numbers, we cannot tell how many tears and bad feeling these figures caused.</strong></p>
<h3>Our idea: use metals from weapons (guns, bullets, knives…) and turn them into something beautiful, like a jewel could be.</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574955300/dk1wsbbbc8bcbvrjjlgj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When Massimo went back to his home city, Vicenza, the projects started. Vicenza is well known around the world for the jewel district: factories, designers, artisans… skills about jewelry at every corner. So it has not been hard to find ideas and skills.</p>
<h2>We use metals melted from weapons and bullets and we will enrich our jewels with precious materials like stones, gold, and silver.</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574958919/qqwgnreqo1hccf76uqaa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>About the brand</h3>
<p><strong>MARTIE means March in Romanian</strong>. March (for the Latins) was the month dedicated to <strong>Mars</strong>, God of War. Besides this, Carol I received his crown in March 1881, and they put it on his head on March 26th, 1881.</p>
<p><strong>So, we decided to branded our collection as MARTIE26.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574955560/lg1samu8mxruj2vuubcm.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>This gave us another idea: every design will not be manufactured in a thousand pieces like big companies do.</p>
<p>We have partnerships with freelance designers and small artisanal companies, we are not looking to manufacture hundreds of pieces.</p>
<h2>We will make just 26 pieces for every design.</h2>
<p>What does this mean? <u><strong>That just 26 people will have the same design, not more, just 26.</strong></u></p>
<p><strong><u>26 masterpieces fully manufactured by Italian and Romanian artisans.</u></strong><br/> </p>
<h3>Why are we setting a crowdfunding campaign?</h3>
<p>Cause we collected different designs, we are moving forward with supplier and artisan, but we need to prototype our first collection and trademark our designs.</p>
<p><strong>We want to take our designs from paper to metal. Our goal is to have our first collection released by Q3 2020.</strong></p>
<p>We need:</p>
<ul>
<li>to buy a 3D printer - FormLab2</li>
<li>to buy a small melting metal furnace</li>
<li>to fully set up our lab</li>
<li>to try different galvanic processes (gold 14K, white gold, black gold, rose gold)</li>
<li>to boost up our marketing activities</li>
<li>to debug and put online our website and e-shop</li>
<li>and last but not least: we will give 5% of the income to charities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we don’t raise funds we will not be able to speed up the project as we have planned. This will not affect the project as it is now, but we think it would be sad not to take advantage of its full potential.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help us here at Martie26. If you like our project, please help us to reach more people.</p>
<p>Please invite people to visit our Indiegogo page and use the Indiegogo share tools to spread our project!</p>

While listening to that story Martie26 was born. Create beauty from tools made to hurt.

Facts
Do you know? In the United States, it is equally likely to die in a car accident than to die killed by a bullet. Yep, think about how many traffic jams you have been in and consider the fact that you may have the same possibility to get into a shooting fight.
In 2017 the victims of these two categories of events were in both cases around 40 thousand.
Free firearms make far more deaths (Americans) than Washington's wars over the past 18 years. ""Accidental"" deaths from firearms between 1999 and 2017 are more than double the number of soldiers killed in the mission from 2001 to 2019 (the victims of firearms, overall, are more than 100 times as much).
These are just numbers, we cannot tell how many tears and bad feeling these figures caused.
Our idea: use metals from weapons (guns, bullets, knives…) and turn them into something beautiful, like a jewel could be.

When Massimo went back to his home city, Vicenza, the projects started. Vicenza is well known around the world for the jewel district: factories, designers, artisans… skills about jewelry at every corner. So it has not been hard to find ideas and skills.
We use metals melted from weapons and bullets and we will enrich our jewels with precious materials like stones, gold, and silver.

About the brand
MARTIE means March in Romanian. March (for the Latins) was the month dedicated to Mars, God of War. Besides this, Carol I received his crown in March 1881, and they put it on his head on March 26th, 1881.
So, we decided to branded our collection as MARTIE26.

This gave us another idea: every design will not be manufactured in a thousand pieces like big companies do.
We have partnerships with freelance designers and small artisanal companies, we are not looking to manufacture hundreds of pieces.
We will make just 26 pieces for every design.
What does this mean? That just 26 people will have the same design, not more, just 26.
26 masterpieces fully manufactured by Italian and Romanian artisans. 
Why are we setting a crowdfunding campaign?
Cause we collected different designs, we are moving forward with supplier and artisan, but we need to prototype our first collection and trademark our designs.
We want to take our designs from paper to metal. Our goal is to have our first collection released by Q3 2020.
We need:

to buy a 3D printer - FormLab2
to buy a small melting metal furnace
to fully set up our lab
to try different galvanic processes (gold 14K, white gold, black gold, rose gold)
to boost up our marketing activities
to debug and put online our website and e-shop
and last but not least: we will give 5% of the income to charities


Risks & Challenges
If we don’t raise funds we will not be able to speed up the project as we have planned. This will not affect the project as it is now, but we think it would be sad not to take advantage of its full potential.

<p>Aberdora signature hats fuse both traditional millinery and sports cap production processes. It was challenging to outsource producer with both technologies under one roof, far from common.</p>
<p>In the absence of a suitable solution, production of our initial limited run* (available as perks) was spread across various facilities, such as: esteemed Christys' London (Oxford) and finishings at K &amp; K factory in London, as well as Aberdora founder, Imran's home design studio in London. This led to logistical and cost issues mentioned above.</p>

<p>By trade, I'm an accomplished<a href=""http://www.imranmusic.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> composer, musician, artist</a>, and millinophile, who grew frustrated by the lack of choice when buying hats and caps, and faced with the following situation: </p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> I was always on the hunt for a certain understated, yet disruptive individualistic look, but found such a treasure to be non-existent.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Learn to cut and sew, and then customise or up-cycle existing designs to my taste.</p>
<p>                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582575801/fjbywqsvp5xdttq5ozuf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Aberdora jacket concept. Watch this space!</i></p>
<p>Out and about in town, I would admiringly be asked, “Where did you get that hat?”, or I would overhear passers by say ""Look at that hat"" (<i>#LookAtThatHat</i>)</p>
<p>These positive reactions became so frequent that I decided to develop and commercialise my very own brand of hat concepts. The unisex accessories brand Aberdora was born.</p>
<p>Aberdora is an acronym, a lyrical extract from an unreleased song I wrote previously:</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>xiomatic <strong>B</strong>eings <strong>E</strong>volve <strong>R</strong>ise <strong>D</strong>iligently <strong>O</strong>vercoming <strong>R</strong>ealis(z)e <strong>A</strong>melioration</p>
<p>With humble beginnings, the decision to commercialise my hat concepts was the start of a six year journey, during which I acquired a wealth of millinery knowledge, and ordering my first custom hat block from Boon And Lane.</p>

<p><i>Trifold Mesh (Prototype 1): I was in dire need of a wallet and this was the perfect solution. “Road testing” this was so much fun!</i></p>
<p>After many iterations, I’d arrived at a gender-neutral design which includes a registered industrial design feature that cleverly positions the “note carrier” inside the inner side of the card pockets. Meanwhile, the short side of the card pockets are set at a 90-degree angle, offset to the note carrier fold, minimising the thickness when fully loaded with money notes and cards.</p>
<p>For the Trifold version, the fold of the inner bi-fold structure sits at opposite end from the cascading credit card pocket opening(s), resulting in a significantly thinner profile than traditional bi and trifold wallets.</p>

Designed in London, England - Aberdora offers disruptive, gender-neutral collections of premium Hat-Cap couture and wallets.

Sunray Hat Cap Collection + Limited run available as Perk

 

 
#LookAtThatHat - The Campaign
Contributors to this campaign will enable Aberdora to centralise production and transform:

Current headwear offerings into a unique comprehensive line of sustainable, fully customisable boutique hat cap cross-pollinations, including ethical vegan materials + a customisable consumer facing product configurator.
Current wallet  offerings into a unique comprehensive line of sustainable fully customisable Aberdora gender neutral wallets including ethical vegan materials + RFID protection + a customisable consumer facing product configurator.

From inception,  there were supply chain issues in relation to outsourcing and manufacturing for Aberdora's unique line of hats: A10/12 Fur Felt/Velvet, Kepi, A45, Sunray and wool felts.

Aberdora signature hats fuse both traditional millinery and sports cap production processes. It was challenging to outsource producer with both technologies under one roof, far from common.
In the absence of a suitable solution, production of our initial limited run* (available as perks) was spread across various facilities, such as: esteemed Christys' London (Oxford) and finishings at K & K factory in London, as well as Aberdora founder, Imran's home design studio in London. This led to logistical and cost issues mentioned above.

2020 Vision
Due diligence done, in 2020 Aberdora solidified a working relationship with Tonak.
Tonak are a well-established ethically sound Czech-based hat manufacturer with both traditional millinery and sports cap production capabilities under one roof. 
So, it's all systems go!
Aberdora is now able to produce unique, high quality customisable boutique hats, which are ethical and sustainable, at a price range to suit all.

How It All Started

Words from the Aberdora Founder Imran Hanif
""Hi, I'm Imran Hanif, founder of Aberdora -  the man behind the brand appearing and performing vocals in the promo video for this campaign: #LookAtThatHat.

Look at my serious music face! With Naked Players drummer Peter ""Dr Ummer""  Jones @ Miloco Livingston Studio 2017 
By trade, I'm an accomplished composer, musician, artist, and millinophile, who grew frustrated by the lack of choice when buying hats and caps, and faced with the following situation: 
Problem: I was always on the hunt for a certain understated, yet disruptive individualistic look, but found such a treasure to be non-existent.
Solution: Learn to cut and sew, and then customise or up-cycle existing designs to my taste.
                  
Aberdora jacket concept. Watch this space!
Out and about in town, I would admiringly be asked, “Where did you get that hat?”, or I would overhear passers by say ""Look at that hat"" (#LookAtThatHat)
These positive reactions became so frequent that I decided to develop and commercialise my very own brand of hat concepts. The unisex accessories brand Aberdora was born.
Aberdora is an acronym, a lyrical extract from an unreleased song I wrote previously:
Axiomatic Beings Evolve Rise Diligently Overcoming Realis(z)e Amelioration
With humble beginnings, the decision to commercialise my hat concepts was the start of a six year journey, during which I acquired a wealth of millinery knowledge, and ordering my first custom hat block from Boon And Lane.

Collecting my first hat block from the great Stephen Lane of Boone & Lane​

Early days at home 2014, experimenting, learning and laughing. 
Shop talk milliner's tip: best pusher downer for me is a Japanese rice serving spatula, works wonders! And I devised my own rounding jack courtesy of B and Q.

Jamaican customs officers were curious as to know why there were so many hats in my suitcase.

Aberdora Bifold Mesh Wallet. Available as a perk.
Wallet Prototyping

Trifold Mesh (Prototype 1): I was in dire need of a wallet and this was the perfect solution. “Road testing” this was so much fun!
After many iterations, I’d arrived at a gender-neutral design which includes a registered industrial design feature that cleverly positions the “note carrier” inside the inner side of the card pockets. Meanwhile, the short side of the card pockets are set at a 90-degree angle, offset to the note carrier fold, minimising the thickness when fully loaded with money notes and cards.
For the Trifold version, the fold of the inner bi-fold structure sits at opposite end from the cascading credit card pocket opening(s), resulting in a significantly thinner profile than traditional bi and trifold wallets.

<p><b>We have built in two different Safety Alarms into ZafeBit, a Silent Alarm and a Sound Alarm that will make a loud 110db noice to scare an attacker away.</b><br/>You will be able to turn on/off both alarms off inside your app where you also set your emergency contact list of people that will get your alertmessage.</p>
<p><b>It´s not only an alarm for violent situations.</b><br/>The silent alarm in ZafeBit Smartwatch is a perfect feature if you are an Extreme Sporter that need a solution to share your position if you need assistance.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">To activate the alarm you must push the two SOS buttons at the side of your watch and when you do your ZafeBit watch will vibrate 3 times to notify you that you have activated it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You will have 5 seconds to turn it off if you didn´t mean to activate it, after that the first person at your list will get an alert that you are in an emergency.<br/>When your friend get the alert he or she will be able to click on the message to see your exact location. They will also see two call buttons, one that calls you and one that calls 911 or 112 depending on where you live. (You set it in your app)</p>
<p>If the first person doesn´t take action and click on the alert within 10 seconds, your app will move on and send an alert to the second person on your list and so on.<br/>When all persons have been contacted without any response it will start over with the first person again up to three times.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">If this alarm is activated inside your app, your watch will make a loud 110db noice and the meaning of this is to scare an attacker away or at least give you a few seconds to get loose and get away.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","ZafeBit is a Smartwatch with some special features.ZafeBit has Two Personal Safety alarms that you can trigger within seconds.The GPS in your ZafeBit Smartwatch will let your friends locate you wherever you are if you get into an emergency.
It´s also an Activity Tracker, Sportwatch and even a Mobile Phone.
We have created ZafeBit with design and safety in focus, we wanted it to look clean and modern to make it wearable but we have filled it with functions to fit almost all people, whatever their interrests are.
Why choose between a Sportwatch, an Activity Tracker, a GPS or a Personal Safety Alarm on your wrist when you can have it all in one?


















ZafeBit Smartwatch messure your steps, calories burned, distance, heartbeats plus it will monitor your sleep and can wake you up with a silent alarm.
To make it the perfect training device we have also added a stopwatch.


You can answer a calls, read your sms, get message notifications from Facebook, Skype, WhatsUp etc. and remote your mobile camera to get the best selfies. To make it perfect we have added WIFI so you can surf the web if you are in a hotspot.
Connect your watch to your mobilephone with blueooth to follow your activity and share it with your friends.







With that said, ZafeBit got something for ALL kind of people because even if you don´t do extreme sports or are interrested in how many steps you have taken we bet that you don´t want to miss that important call or message, but the most important thing is that IF an emergency happen you know that you will be able to alert your friends in seconds.






We have built in two different Safety Alarms into ZafeBit, a Silent Alarm and a Sound Alarm that will make a loud 110db noice to scare an attacker away.You will be able to turn on/off both alarms off inside your app where you also set your emergency contact list of people that will get your alertmessage.
It´s not only an alarm for violent situations.The silent alarm in ZafeBit Smartwatch is a perfect feature if you are an Extreme Sporter that need a solution to share your position if you need assistance.


To activate the alarm you must push the two SOS buttons at the side of your watch and when you do your ZafeBit watch will vibrate 3 times to notify you that you have activated it.

You will have 5 seconds to turn it off if you didn´t mean to activate it, after that the first person at your list will get an alert that you are in an emergency.When your friend get the alert he or she will be able to click on the message to see your exact location. They will also see two call buttons, one that calls you and one that calls 911 or 112 depending on where you live. (You set it in your app)
If the first person doesn´t take action and click on the alert within 10 seconds, your app will move on and send an alert to the second person on your list and so on.When all persons have been contacted without any response it will start over with the first person again up to three times.


If this alarm is activated inside your app, your watch will make a loud 110db noice and the meaning of this is to scare an attacker away or at least give you a few seconds to get loose and get away.

If this alarm is activated it will start instantly when you trigger the alarm buttons.

<p>Let us introduce you to LEONFETCH,  the brand and our Kenada sneakers.  We are big lovers of Japanese culture and those of you who are sharp eyed will notice a connection with a famous Anime movie. Either you love it or hate it, our striking and functional split toe design is a definite feature.  A split toe or Tabi is very Traditional in Japanese culture,  it is preferred choice of footwear where tactile confidence is needed while working,  e.g workers on building sites, gardeners and general work that requires physical activity.  Tabi toes were also used during the 90's and was popular among African marathon runners as it replicates a natural running style,  as many of these runners did train in bare feet.  </p>

<p>Our base is here in the UK and our craftsmen produce in Japan.  We speak English they speak Japanese!  We were against it from the start.  Solution? Well we didn't have the budget to go to Japan!  The phone calls made 5 am in the morning  ending up in  awkward silences, hellos and thank you's so e-mail it was!   E-mails were simplified, challenges and solutions were illustrated and photographed. But wires were still crossed. But we got here..<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499540683/hxvw2mrzytetjjir2fil.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TARGETS </strong></h3>
<p>We really want to be the up there with the most successful campaigns and we want to reach the sky.

Not only do we want you to embrace us but also spread the word about us! </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHATS NEXT?</h3>
<p><strong>Scenario 1 :</strong> OK we did it,  so we hit our targets &amp; delivered all our perks on time.  The question is what next? You not only bought a one time product but started a seed for future products to develop that reflect our core philosophies, loyalty, reliability and play.  </p>
<ul>
<li>As a brand we want to explore new design details and offer more new lines in the future. </li>
<li>We are hoping the best piece of marketing we can get is word of mouth!  We know the internet is accessible to everyone,  but nothing beats human interaction.  Continuing from the success of previous trade shows, we can strengthen this connection by showcasing at future exhibitions, shows and events. </li>

<p><strong>Scenario 2 :  </strong>So we didn't hit our potential and we did not  reach minimum order target.   As a safety net for you,  we have opted for a fixed fundraiser!   This means if we don't reach our targets you get your money back!  But we don't think this is the end,  this is a great opportunity for us to take a step back and re-evaluate.  </p>

The  foundations of LEONFETCH are inspired by our relationship with man's best friend.  Loyalty, reliability, and play are the key elements that bond us with our favourite friends.  We at LEONFETCH want to  explore and translate this into the products we design.      
 
CONSULTANTS / BLOGGERS / MAGAZINES / SOCIAL 

LEONFETCH has steadily gained attention of high profile bloggers, consultants, magazines and stylists from around the world. They are a tight-nit community and love all things different. They were drawn towards the LEONFETCH brand because we dare to be different.

KENADA RUNNING SHOE BY LEONFETCH
Let us introduce you to LEONFETCH,  the brand and our Kenada sneakers.  We are big lovers of Japanese culture and those of you who are sharp eyed will notice a connection with a famous Anime movie. Either you love it or hate it, our striking and functional split toe design is a definite feature.  A split toe or Tabi is very Traditional in Japanese culture,  it is preferred choice of footwear where tactile confidence is needed while working,  e.g workers on building sites, gardeners and general work that requires physical activity.  Tabi toes were also used during the 90's and was popular among African marathon runners as it replicates a natural running style,  as many of these runners did train in bare feet.  

HANDMADE
Our sneakers are handmade. We have a partnership with craftsmen in Japan and we work on every detail, from stitching and colourways to material selection. We strive for the best to achieve a reliable premium product for play and loyalty. 


STYLE AND FUNCTION
Loyalty, reliability, and play. We believe these qualities can equate to individual style and a functional piece of wear!  Rock the Kenada, a running shoe for all occasions! 



 
PERFORMANCE & HEALTH
Performance testing was also part of our campaign,  we benefit from a close partnership with craftsmen in Japan who are experts in fit, ergonomics and engineering.  However due to our obsessive nature we still wanted to product test ourselves!  We brought on an experienced fitness consultant Dominic Adam to our team.  With Dominic we were able to confirm performance and build quality.   


 
Enrich your training on natural or soft surfaces and activate all your foot muscles and tendons. Kenada's simulates the barefoot experience and forces your feet to adapt to the terrain. A strong athlete starts with strong feet. 


 
COLOUR-WAYS
Colours inspired by the playful BMX scene and archive collection's of fashion. Stand out or conform we have a colour for you!  
 

 

ACCESSORISE 
By now you were probably wondering about socks! Normal socks won't work!  Don't worry we have teamed up with a Japanese manufacturer and all Kenada sneakers come with high grade Tabi Socks, specially designed to work with our design. At the end of the campaign there will be an option to specify your preferred sock colour.  You can also purchase additional pairs through our perk options. 

As part of our perks we are offering our LEONFETCH T-Shirts with multiple buys.  This T-Shirt has a unique  rabbit logo on the front chest reflecting our playfull brand.  Sizes available -  S - XL.    You can also purchase separately through our perk options.


PRICING 
We cut out the middle man which means we can control the cost and deliver a better priced product without compromising on quality. So we sell directly to you via pre-orders to cut retailers margins and optimise logistics. As such, we're able to mark it for £210 (vs. £350 full store retail price).  For launch we're offering great savings!
 
THE PERKS
Choose your Perks! Whether you just want to give us a shout out or buy a big batch order for you and your friends, we have all options below!  As Early backers there are great savings to be had!

Want to stock our product in your boutique/store? We have a 10 x kenada boutique special please contact us : info@leonfetch.com
 
SIZE & FITTING


Our sneakers are designed for a comfort fit. If you find the size you order isn't quite right for you, we are happy to exchange for an alternative.   We will ask for a small additional charge towards shipping for returns.   
PLACE YOUR ORDER

Click on the perks you wish to buy on the right hand side.  You will be able to choose colour and size options on a survey that will be e-mailed to you after you pledge.  We welcome any specific requests, please e-mail us!

DEVELOPMENT
Our base is here in the UK and our craftsmen produce in Japan.  We speak English they speak Japanese!  We were against it from the start.  Solution? Well we didn't have the budget to go to Japan!  The phone calls made 5 am in the morning  ending up in  awkward silences, hellos and thank you's so e-mail it was!   E-mails were simplified, challenges and solutions were illustrated and photographed. But wires were still crossed. But we got here..



TARGETS 
We really want to be the up there with the most successful campaigns and we want to reach the sky. Our minimum is 100 units but we really want to go beyond.  1000 units would enable us to keep to plan and hit the economies of scale needed. Not only do we want you to embrace us but also spread the word about us! 

WHATS NEXT?
Scenario 1 : OK we did it,  so we hit our targets & delivered all our perks on time.  The question is what next? You not only bought a one time product but started a seed for future products to develop that reflect our core philosophies, loyalty, reliability and play.  

As a brand we want to explore new design details and offer more new lines in the future. 
We are hoping the best piece of marketing we can get is word of mouth!  We know the internet is accessible to everyone,  but nothing beats human interaction.  Continuing from the success of previous trade shows, we can strengthen this connection by showcasing at future exhibitions, shows and events.

Scenario 2 :  So we didn't hit our potential and we did not  reach minimum order target.   As a safety net for you,  we have opted for a fixed fundraiser!   This means if we don't reach our targets you get your money back!  But we don't think this is the end,  this is a great opportunity for us to take a step back and re-evaluate.  
 
 





THE CHALLENGE 

You already know what is involved in such campaigns,  there are many factors that are out of our control. Not only are you giving us an opportunity to provide you with a great product , it also gives us a chance to learn and evolve.  We understand the most important thing is that you are informed throughout the process .  To adhere our core philosophy of reliability we promise to keep you updated through our website, e-mail and social media.
We welcome your questions -  Please email us!



 
IMPORTANT NOTE 
It is the contributor’s responsibility to ensure items can be legally imported to their country and how much import taxes might cost,  'WE' have little to no control over this. If contributors incur a customs/VAT tax, they will receive a notice and simply go to their carrier or post office to pay the tax before the item is released.

<p>Earth really is about our roots, our centredness, stability and structure; it's slow and steady and allows us to connect very deeply with ourselves and the planet.</p>
<p>Water rules our emotions, our feelings and vulnerability. It is where we digest all the input and sensations of the world around us. Water is always in motion and constantly changing, like the tides. Deeply connecting to your emotional side allows for enhanced empathy and authenticity.</p>
<p>Air enhances our light-heartedness, it is flirty and loose. Always on the go and never settling. Like the butterfly, the light air breeze or the kiss of a stranger. This uniquely, divine touch of innocence, joy and easy pleasure without any further involvement. It is gone as soon as it has come.</p>
<p>Light. This element is only found in the tattwic system and might be a different experience for anyone. For me it is expansion, wideness and the connection to the divine. It has the golden qualities that so far outstretch our human experience. It is beyond and that is where it takes you.</p>

<h2>The Benefits</h2>
<p>By connecting to the Elements, we can purposefully connect to different aspects of our personality; enhance given qualities and talents; and re-activate those that lie dormant.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>The whole project of Yogarts started in mid 2017 at a small local airport in Mexico. By that time I was working at a Yoga Healing Retreat in Puerto Escondido as a Yoga and meditation teacher and assistant retreat manager. While waiting for my ongoing flight, this one thought crossed my mind:</p>
<p>""If the space I go to in meditation, is the same space that all my drawings come from - why wouldn't I combine the two and enhance each one by the other?"" The idea was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After all the stages we have gone through so far, we want to go live NOW. So next is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finalizing Website and Online Platforms</li>
<li>Marketing, Social Media, Online and Local Presence</li>
<li>Having you involved! In sharing your experience, contributing with your ideas, etc.</li>

If you would fully live your passion - what would be the outcome?
 Yogarts is the result of passion, a dream and the curiosity to try out something new.
Our love for Art, Movement and Freedom has brought these new mats to life.
 
The Product

 
In choosing material, production, co-operators and size we have tried to make the mats as natural, environmentally - as well as people-friendly, stink-free on delivery, washable, light and practical in carrying around, beautiful and unique to look at and energetically inspiring to move on. People have been amazed by the material, the firm grip on the floor - which allows a heavy practice - the unique and energizing designs as well as the light weight compared to other mats.
 

The first Series is inspired by the 5 Tattwic Elements:
Fire, Earth, Water, Air and Light. Each Element has its very own essence and quality.
Fire would rule our passion, our drive, our willpower and strength in mind, our focus and motivation to go for what we want in life.
Earth really is about our roots, our centredness, stability and structure; it's slow and steady and allows us to connect very deeply with ourselves and the planet.
Water rules our emotions, our feelings and vulnerability. It is where we digest all the input and sensations of the world around us. Water is always in motion and constantly changing, like the tides. Deeply connecting to your emotional side allows for enhanced empathy and authenticity.
Air enhances our light-heartedness, it is flirty and loose. Always on the go and never settling. Like the butterfly, the light air breeze or the kiss of a stranger. This uniquely, divine touch of innocence, joy and easy pleasure without any further involvement. It is gone as soon as it has come.
Light. This element is only found in the tattwic system and might be a different experience for anyone. For me it is expansion, wideness and the connection to the divine. It has the golden qualities that so far outstretch our human experience. It is beyond and that is where it takes you.
 
The Benefits
By connecting to the Elements, we can purposefully connect to different aspects of our personality; enhance given qualities and talents; and re-activate those that lie dormant.

<br/>The Future </h3>Although above you only see one shirt design, these are only the beginning to what the company will create. The design was made to simply to get the brands name out to the world.

</div></div>","About the Project

L8 Boy Clothing was created by Me (Josiah Terronez) a eighteen year old artist (fresh out of high school), who has a passion for art and a love for fashion. I've always enjoyed illustration, photography, graphic design and fashion. I decided that it was my mission to bring art and design to modern fashion. I'm just like any other eighteen year old boy, I play video games, read comics, and spend most of my time watching television. But It was time to get off my ass and do something for myself. As a young artist I wanted to create something of my own, combining my love for fashion and passion for art to created LATE BOY Clothing; a illustration and design driven brand, with the influences of streetwear and modern apparel.  It all started with an Idea. I've always wanted to start my own brand, I just never had the courage to start it. But after sitting on the idea for awhile, and imagining what this company could become, I decided to just go for it. The Logo Process






I started to design shirts, to show off one of the brand logos. 


Men's Heather Grey Shirt & Black Shirt 



*note that these are photos of old prototype shirts.*

The Future Although above you only see one shirt design, these are only the beginning to what the company will create. The design was made to simply to get the brands name out to the world. The goal is to print more designs and products, that I have lined up for the future. Hopefully if I reach my campaign goal I can launch my first collection.
I have big dreams for this company. But at the moment all I have is dreams. So, I need your help to make those dreams a reality. Your contributions will help me build a online business of my own.

<strong>Hello Indiegogo</strong>, my name is Jakša Račić.<p><u>Sock's Secrets</u> is a project I started two years ago out of trouble I had. Namely, when I used to spend a lot of time behind the steering wheel, I had problems with excessive feet sweating and therefore unpleasant smells. Since I have an innovative spirit I came up with an idea for this product.</p>
<p>I don't like travelling nor working by myself, so I gathered friends of different occupations/proffesions who helped me with the development of this project. With a team of experts we created socks which completely meet my personal needs, but also the needs of many like me.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We planned collecting a total amount of <strong>32.000 USD</strong> with this campaign.</p>
<p>We contrived investing that money into two currently most important processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><i>23.000 USD</i> – to purchase <u>raw materials</u> needed for the first phase of production.</p></li>
<li>The rest of the money<i> (9.000 USD)</i> – would be invested into <u>marketing activities</u>. Part of it to create a web page with a web shop, part of it to make marketing materials such as <i>flyers, bilboards ect</i>. needed for <u>presentations</u> on <u>trade shows</u>, the attendance of trade shows itself and of course investment in <u>web advertising</u> and growth on <u>social media</u>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we<strong> don't raise</strong> all the money we intented to, our priority is the purchase of <u>raw materials</u>, after which we'll invest the rest of the money into <u>marketing</u>.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We developed a product <i>„ANTIMICROBAL SOCKS“</i> which<strong> allow </strong>the feet to sweat, but <strong>disable</strong> the procreation of fungus, bacteria and microbs which are the reason why unpleasant smells occure. Our product consists of<strong> high quality</strong> cotton cultivated in <u>controlled conditions</u>, dyed with dyes that<strong> don't have</strong> heavy metals in them. The knit on the sole of the socks that prevents procreation of microbs is in its original production color and has <strong>multiannual activness</strong>. Ordinary laundry washing<strong> doesn't affect </strong>its <u>properties</u>.</p>
<p>The <i>„JR SOCKS“</i> were created out of need to protect small<strong> valuable items</strong>, <i>e.g. ID cards, credit cards, cash, mobile phones ect.,</i> additionally from possible <u>theft</u> or  <u>loss</u>. The <i>„JR SOCKS“</i> also have <strong>antimicrobal properties</strong>.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Our team consists of people with<strong> different</strong> proffesions and skills: <i>IT specialists, sales managers, accountants, textile experts, innovators</i>...but with same team spirit and sedulity. This gives us the <u>confidence</u> to believe in the future of our project and campaign.</p>

Il est différent pour chacun, selon nos impératifs du quotidien.Que votre essentiel soit vos enfants ou vos parents, votre métier ou votre vie privée, il nécessite votre attention pleine et entière. Cette attention est aujourd'hui trop souvent détournée par ces notifications numériques qui nous submergent en permanence. Profitez de l’instant présent, Goji s'occupe du reste. Des recherches ont été faites à propos de nos interactions avec notre smartphone, que nous regardons en moyenne 210 fois par jour.Les résultats montrent clairement qu'avoir un smartphone constamment avec nous a un impact négatif sur notre attention. Désactiver toutes les notifications est une solution un peu trop drastique.Goji filtre et vous envoie des vibrations lorsque la notification est importante pour vous.  Goji utilise les dernières technologies de façon discrète et non-intrusive pour vous connecter à l’essentiel. Ses vibrations vous informent si vos proches ont besoin de vous, si vous avez une mission à accomplir. Pour qui est Goji ?Pour vous, vos amies, vos proches, ayant du mal à lâcher le téléphone, de peur de rater une information importante.Pour celles qui souhaitent prendre du recul pour se concentrer sur les moments essentiels de leur quotidien. D'où vient Goji ?Nous sommes une start-up Nantaise qui a pour objectif d'améliorer notre quotidien.

<h3>How Waseem Authentic Came About</h3>
<p>The inspiration for Waseem Authentic came when I needed products to manage my beard but couldn’t find a brand that I could support. I grow my beard due to religious reasons, but it gets prickly, itchy and messy from time to time. When I searched for products to help with that, I found brands that promoted themselves using silly gimmicks with the word ‘lumbersexual’ flying around a lot. I don’t keep my beard to attract women or look manly. I don’t do it to please others, I do it for me. I wanted a product that was simple and got the job done but was from a brand that I could get behind. So I grabbed a couple buddies and started my own.</p>

<p>Beards are a lot about community than the individual that they are on. Therefore, we have partnered with WaterAid so that when you look after your facial hair, you will be looking after millions across the world who don't have access to clean water, sanitation or hygiene.</p>

<p>WaterAid focuses on providing safe water, decent toilets and good hygiene – the three essentials that unlock progress for people, communities and economies worldwide. Without all three, people can’t live dignified, healthy lives. With all three, they can break free from poverty, unleash their potential and change their lives for good. WaterAid works in 38 countries worldwide, transforming millions of lives every year with clean water, sanitation and hygiene projects.</p>
<p>Right now, the world’s poorest people do not have access to clean water, sanitation or hygiene. This crisis is ruining lives and holding back development. Good hygiene maximizes the benefits of clean water and proper toilets, preventing the spread of deadly disease and keeping people healthy so they can go to school or earn a living.</p>
<p>In just 35 years, with the global support of amazing supporters, WaterAid has made enormous progress. Since 1981, they have provided 24.9 million people with safe water, and since 2004, 24 million people have received improved sanitation. Their goal is to provide clean water and safe toilets to everyone, everywhere by 2030.</p>
<p>You and your beard can be a part of that progress.</p>

<div>
<p>We are happy to present you the first innovative luxury bag - CLOVER.</p>
<p>We wanted to be like other market leaders, but our product turned out to be more technological and more convenient to use. All well-known brands care only about their name, but we care about you.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that we are expensive, but our Italian leather, accessories we use, our innovations as well as our labour cost a fortune.</p>
<p>Such a combination of quality and price as ours cannot be found in any other brand - we are the first.  Now, the Clover Bag is a high-functioning accessory that changes the way we understand bags.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Our main goal is to create the new brand of innovative, smart bags with high quality, high functionality and at same time high exterior standarts. Kickstarter is our first step on the way. We are opened for any ideas and ready to implement them in the future. Duty/VAT charges: Some international backers will be subjects to local customs import duties and taxes; these backers will be responsible for covering all of their local customs duties and taxes. Import duties and taxes are not covered by this Clover campaign. Customs: Some countries are known for being very slow with customs, and you probably know if you live in one. We hope that you will receive the package as soon as possible. Creating a new product is always a challenge, but we are well-prepared: we have signed contracts with reliable suppliers, we have the best craftsmen. We have done everything to create and deliver the best Clover bags to our backers on time.</p>
</div></div>","Meet the Clover Bag, the clever bag you always waited for

We are happy to present you the first innovative luxury bag - CLOVER.
We wanted to be like other market leaders, but our product turned out to be more technological and more convenient to use. All well-known brands care only about their name, but we care about you.
Yes, we know that we are expensive, but our Italian leather, accessories we use, our innovations as well as our labour cost a fortune.
Such a combination of quality and price as ours cannot be found in any other brand - we are the first.  Now, the Clover Bag is a high-functioning accessory that changes the way we understand bags.
 Our Clover collection for Kickstarter
 
The Clover bag keeps everything in order. It has a modular design, which means an inner part can be easily transferred to another bag.

The removable inner part – which lets you transfer items from one bag to another in a couple of seconds - just move the inner compartment with all the contents from one bag to the other. It really saves time. Available in 4 main models.

Inner removable part includes (for free):

wallet for coins
wireless light
key holder
bottle holder
headphone holder
branded steel pen and table bag holder

 Light up the bag! Light up the world!
 
 
The Clover bag lights everything up. Literally. No more arduous endeavors in search of needed things. Internal wireless light works from the motion sensor. To turn it on, simply put your hand in your bag. It helps you find things in the dark. Available in most of the models.
On this photo you can see a wallet for coins
The bag combines beauty and functionality.

 The bag cares about every single detail and makes them simple for you.
Here you can see the insides of the inner removable part and key holders
 and a lot of accessories that keep your bags organized

is it to learn about X-shoe? Can a person who doesn’t know how to skate learn
it?</span><br/></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>A：</b>The product is
easy to learn with an average of 10 minutes learning time. It is very  stable in its own right that, unlike skating
shoes making you fall because of easy slipping, you just have to stand firm
with X-shoes on. It is necessary for beginners to learn how to stand firm, calf
carrying the force, which will render the calves tired with long duration of
sliding. It requires some time to adjust accordingly. Although the X-shoe is
heavier than a regular one, the difference between them is not that obvious. A
person not so strong may take a fews days before getting used to its weight,
otherwise it is easy for users above 70 kilograms to handle.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>2、Q：</b>What should we
pay attention to while using?</span><br/></p>
<p><b>A：</b>1、<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It is recommended that beginners practice in a less
populated place, preferably a flat surface. It is inadvisable for beginners to
practice on slopes and they should wear protective gears like kneepads and
helmets.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">      2、</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">During the learning process, it is unwise to skate
with great acceleration. After getting familiar with the shoes, you may go into
the streets.  If obstacle or any other
incident leads to an abrupt halt, placing your forefeet on the ground to
cushion the momentum is a very practical and safe approach. Before learning to
skate, you may firstly get to know how to stop applying the method.</span></p>
<p>      3、<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Beginner should decelerate when turning and stomp both
feet to stop if it is too late to slow down.</span></p>
<p>      4、<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Please do not overburden the shoes above the specified
load capacity, or climb slopes for long duration, because it will cause the motor
and drive board to overheat which eventually will shut down the system due to
safety issues.</span></p>
<p>       5、<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Before sliding, it is best to first slide both feet
back and forth to ensure the shoes are ready.</span></p>
<p>       6、<span style=""background-color: initial;"">With the product being active, please do not jump from
a height of 1 meter or above. If you jump, it should be the forefeet on the

distorted and damaged.</span></p>
<p>       7、<span style=""background-color: initial;"">When under

cellphones can connect to the shoes to control it through the volumes up and

leaning left and right. If you are used to control it through your phones, you

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>6、Q：</b>What should I
do when encountering obstruction when sliding?</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>A：</b>Most roads in many

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>7、Q：</b>What kind of
roads is suitable for X-shoe?</span></p>
<p><b>A：</b>Hard and flat surfaces are suitable for sliding, like

<p><b>A：</b>On a flat surface
with a breeze, a 80 kilograms user is able to slide for at least 5 kilometers.
If under better condition, it reaches up to 7 km. Different load and wind
velocity, climbing up and down slopes and frequently shutting down and starting
the system can result in various distance per charge.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>A:</b>1、Due to

between 100 and 120 kilograms. Considering the overall structural strength and
power supply, if it is above the maximum load, the shoes are likely to be
damaged under strenuous exercises or other extreme cases. Under specified load,
the shoes almost are unable to break in normal operation. If they are
overloaded, the motor will need even more power that slopes are harder to climb
and the distance per charge will be much shorter, which is why it is best to
operate below the maximum carrying load.</span><br/></p>

additive property. You can dirve it at  a top speed of 15km/h which
is about 3 times than that of walking.  
If you need  a normal walking, the four rubber tires of the electric shoe
will be automatic locked through controlling the bluetooth remote control. At
the same time, the two elastic cushion of fore sole will eject. The locked tire
will be as comfortable as rubber sole, and it can walk, run and jump as
ordinary sports shoes on the basis of at least 7 supporting point. When needing
to glide, pack up the two elastic cushion of fore sole through controlling the
remote control, and the four rubber tires will automatic unlock, then it can
normal travel with people on. On the basis of controlling to slow down or
brake, the user can quickly stop with only fore sole landing for several steps
of buffer.




 
 No matter taking the subway, bus or walk, the ESMAR X-shoe will bring you a more relax and pleasant journey experience. At present, the configured battery of electric shoe with full energy has a endurance of 5 kilometers, which can meet the walking need of a person.











Starting them, in a matter of seconds
it reaches to top speed. It is absolutely amazing to be going like a flash
whenever you want.

<p>Wir sind ein kleines, aber eingespieltes Team aus der IT-Branche. Unser Unternehmen besteht konkret aus 5 Mitarbeiten und deckt intern folgende Aufgabenbereiche ab: Programmierung, Online- &amp; Social-Media-Marketing sowie Design &amp; Redaktion. Jeder von uns ist Spezialist und auf seinem jeweiligen Gebiet bereits mehrere Jahre tätig.</p><p>Das gesamte Team lebt und arbeitet in Wien, unser Firmensitz liegt aufgrund günstigerer Konditionen allerdings in Bratislava. Gemeinsam ist es uns mit viel Ehrgeiz gelungen, das Unternehmen samt seiner Platform BinGeil ohnerlei finanzielle Unterstützung ins Leben zu rufen.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>Obwohl unser Team wie eben beschrieben bereits viele wichtige Arbeitsbereiche abdeckt und die Web-App auch schon voll einsatzbereit ist, fehlen uns dennoch wesentliche Aspekte für einen kommerziellen Erfolg:</p>
<h4><br/></h4><h4>Vertrieb </h4>
<p>Für einen erfolgreichen Vertrieb benötigen wir finanzielle Unterstützung. Damit soll primär ein starkes Vertriebsteam aufgebaut werden, das auch abseits der virtuellen Welt für Kundenakquise sorgt. So wird es uns möglich sein, unser Service schon bald in mehreren Städten und Ländern anzubieten. </p><p><br/></p>
<h4>Marketing</h4>
<p>Der zweite Bereich des Investments betrifft die Marketingkosten; momentan schalten wir gezielte Werbung mittels Google Adwords. Ein Teil des Erlöses unserer Crowdfunding-Campagne soll daher in die Investition für eine erhöhte Schaltung im Onlinebereich fließen. Auch Merchandising-Aktionen sowie die klassische Flyer-Verteilung fallen in diesen Bereich; Informationen zu unseren Produkten finden Sie weiter unten in den Perks (zB Kondome, T-Shirts, Feuerzeuge uvm.). <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h4>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Planung</span><br/>
</h4><div>Mit dem angestrebten Budget von € 12.000 ist es uns möglich, eine weitere Stadt in der Größenordnung Wiens erfolgreich zu akquirieren und zu bewerben. Die Entscheidung unser Projekt generell in Wien zu starten liegt daran, dass das gesamte Arbeitsteam in dieser Stadt angesiedelt ist.<br/><br/><br/> </div><div><h4>Ziel 2015/2016 =&gt; Österreich, Deutschland &amp; Schweiz</h4></div><div>

<p>Unser Ziel ist es, bereits heuer und vor allem im kommenden Jahr (neben Österreich) auch in Deutschland und der Schweiz zu launchen. Dies geschieht, sobald wir den nötigen Umsatz in Wien erwirtschaftet haben. Sollten wir durch unsere Crowdfunding-Kampagne allerdings mehr Einnahmen als erhofft erzielen, so wird das überschüssige Buget automatisch für die Ausweitung der Web-App in unsere Nachbarländer verwendet.

</div></div>","BinGeil ist eine Web-App, die es professionellen SexarbeiterInnen ermöglicht, kommerzielle Inserate zu schalten. 
Die Web-App ist bereits fertig entwickelt und auch schon online verfügbar. Mehr Informationen gibt's hier (FB-Login nötig): https://www.facebook.com/BinGeilUnser ZielWir bieten unseren UserInnen eine seriöse Plattform, die sich vom oft schmuddeligen Image des Milieus klar distanziert. Wir stellen daher ein Kontakt-Service zur Verfügung, über das SexarbeiterInnen ihre Kundenkreise erweitern können. Es ist uns ein großes Anliegen die „alten Wege“ der Sexarbeit zu modernisieren, um unseren InserentInnen mehr Selbständigkeit für ihre berufliche Zukunft zu ermöglichen. Für KundInnen ist und bleibt die Web-App kostenlos, anfallende Gebühren für das Schalten von Inseraten werden allein von der werbenden Person getragen. Diese Kosten sind im Vergleich zu anderen Mitstreitern jedoch relativ günstig gehalten. Die Web-App ist überdies spielend leicht zu bedienen und auch ästhetisch gesehen ein echter Hingucker. Sie ist rund um die Uhr auf der ganzen Welt verfügbar und lässt sich am Desktop genauso so anwenden wie über Tablets und Mobiltelefone.

Die BinGeil Web-App umfasst viele attraktive Features wie:Datensicherheit
Eine Kartenansicht/Listenansicht mit exakter Angabe zur Entfernung der nähesten SexworkerInnen sowie eine Auskunft über den aktuellen Status der SexworkerInnen (Bereit/Beschäftigt/Offline)






Detaillierte Profile zu einzelnen SexworkerInnen (Bilder, Leistungen, Preise uvm.)









Die Möglichkeit zur direkten Kontaktaufnahme mit SexworkerInnen (per Anruf und SMS)



Die Suche nach speziellen Wünschen und Bedürfnissen (angebotene Leistungen der SexworkerInnen)


uvm.

Wir sind ein kleines, aber eingespieltes Team aus der IT-Branche. Unser Unternehmen besteht konkret aus 5 Mitarbeiten und deckt intern folgende Aufgabenbereiche ab: Programmierung, Online- & Social-Media-Marketing sowie Design & Redaktion. Jeder von uns ist Spezialist und auf seinem jeweiligen Gebiet bereits mehrere Jahre tätig.Das gesamte Team lebt und arbeitet in Wien, unser Firmensitz liegt aufgrund günstigerer Konditionen allerdings in Bratislava. Gemeinsam ist es uns mit viel Ehrgeiz gelungen, das Unternehmen samt seiner Platform BinGeil ohnerlei finanzielle Unterstützung ins Leben zu rufen.

Obwohl unser Team wie eben beschrieben bereits viele wichtige Arbeitsbereiche abdeckt und die Web-App auch schon voll einsatzbereit ist, fehlen uns dennoch wesentliche Aspekte für einen kommerziellen Erfolg:
Vertrieb 
Für einen erfolgreichen Vertrieb benötigen wir finanzielle Unterstützung. Damit soll primär ein starkes Vertriebsteam aufgebaut werden, das auch abseits der virtuellen Welt für Kundenakquise sorgt. So wird es uns möglich sein, unser Service schon bald in mehreren Städten und Ländern anzubieten. 
Marketing
Der zweite Bereich des Investments betrifft die Marketingkosten; momentan schalten wir gezielte Werbung mittels Google Adwords. Ein Teil des Erlöses unserer Crowdfunding-Campagne soll daher in die Investition für eine erhöhte Schaltung im Onlinebereich fließen. Auch Merchandising-Aktionen sowie die klassische Flyer-Verteilung fallen in diesen Bereich; Informationen zu unseren Produkten finden Sie weiter unten in den Perks (zB Kondome, T-Shirts, Feuerzeuge uvm.). 
Planung
Mit dem angestrebten Budget von € 12.000 ist es uns möglich, eine weitere Stadt in der Größenordnung Wiens erfolgreich zu akquirieren und zu bewerben. Die Entscheidung unser Projekt generell in Wien zu starten liegt daran, dass das gesamte Arbeitsteam in dieser Stadt angesiedelt ist. Ziel 2015/2016 => Österreich, Deutschland & Schweiz



Unser Ziel ist es, bereits heuer und vor allem im kommenden Jahr (neben Österreich) auch in Deutschland und der Schweiz zu launchen. Dies geschieht, sobald wir den nötigen Umsatz in Wien erwirtschaftet haben. Sollten wir durch unsere Crowdfunding-Kampagne allerdings mehr Einnahmen als erhofft erzielen, so wird das überschüssige Buget automatisch für die Ausweitung der Web-App in unsere Nachbarländer verwendet. Je eher Sie uns also unterstützen, desto früher können Sie BinGeil für Ihre unmittelbare Umgebung nutzen!

<p>We are ready for production, but we need the support of a group of people who love our watches as much as we do.</p>
<p>To ensure top quality in every aspect of a Clerestone watch and its accessories, we are working with several Chinese manufacturers. Our dial manufacturer has over 10 years experience in the gemstone industry. Our gemstones are sourced from all around the world and cut with precision. We have carefully selected manufacturers for our watches, boxes, microfiber cloths, and our straps, who are all experts in their field.</p>
<p>We have covered all costs for our design and manufacturing up to this stage.</p>
<h3><u><strong>Our fixed goal is the minimum funds we need to cover the manufacture and shipping costs for all perks to our backers.</strong></u></h3>
<p>Indiegogo perk fulfilment is subject to best efforts and not guaranteed. Fulfilment is our responsibility and we take it seriously. We are confident that once we reach our funding goal, all backers can receive their chosen perks.</p>
<p>We have prior experience in manufacturing so we know that there are always risks and challenges. We have already overcome many issues to get to where we are today and we expect there will be more snags along the way. We know we can tackle any issues that arise and we have allowed reasonable time frames for each stage to give us some buffer in the event of delays. We will be posting regular updates to keep our backers informed.</p>
<p>We are excited and confident that within 8-10 weeks of a successful campaign, all our backers can be wearing their chosen Clerestone perk.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Warranty and Refunds</h3>
<p>Clerestone Watches warranty covers manufacturer's defects for <strong>3 years</strong> from the end of our post campaign shipping period. Your watch movement, case, hands and dial are covered by warranty.

</div><p> </p></div>","We are ready for production, but we need the support of a group of people who love our watches as much as we do.
To ensure top quality in every aspect of a Clerestone watch and its accessories, we are working with several Chinese manufacturers. Our dial manufacturer has over 10 years experience in the gemstone industry. Our gemstones are sourced from all around the world and cut with precision. We have carefully selected manufacturers for our watches, boxes, microfiber cloths, and our straps, who are all experts in their field.
We have covered all costs for our design and manufacturing up to this stage.
Our fixed goal is the minimum funds we need to cover the manufacture and shipping costs for all perks to our backers.
Indiegogo perk fulfilment is subject to best efforts and not guaranteed. Fulfilment is our responsibility and we take it seriously. We are confident that once we reach our funding goal, all backers can receive their chosen perks.
We have prior experience in manufacturing so we know that there are always risks and challenges. We have already overcome many issues to get to where we are today and we expect there will be more snags along the way. We know we can tackle any issues that arise and we have allowed reasonable time frames for each stage to give us some buffer in the event of delays. We will be posting regular updates to keep our backers informed.
We are excited and confident that within 8-10 weeks of a successful campaign, all our backers can be wearing their chosen Clerestone perk.

<i>I'm Anastasia Akasha Kaur</i> ~</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A yogi, mother, dirt worshipping tree hugger, and designer of the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT.</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505832740/ub3nxuapf6m7op3odtli.jpg"" src=""""/>                           <strong>I needed a pair of pants that were comfortable, organic, sweatshop-free <i>and </i>stylish. They also needed to be versatile and appropriate for all the fun, amazing, and many things I like to do! I searched for years for these pants, and spent a lot of money on pants that never really looked good or felt right for me. I finally realized that in order to have the perfect pant, I had to design it ~ and the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT was born.</strong></p>
<p>     As a woman with so many roles to play ~ sometimes all in the run of one day ~ having one pair of pants that can work no matter what I need to do is practical (and let's admit, much easier on the pocket book!) The amazing thing is, the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT accommodates a woman's needs no matter what phase of life she's in too.The fold over organic cotton/lycra waistband expands and contracts to meet the needs of active teenagers, mothers-to-be, and wise crones. </p>
<p>     Once the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT idea was born, I found the perfect person to manufacture them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505828663/agex9c0epb49soxyywyd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>     Reza Iso is a Syrian refugee who recently moved to Nova Scotia with his family to escape the civil war that created the worst humanitarian crisis of our time. Half the country’s pre-war population — more than 11 million people — have been killed or forced to flee their homes. I am grateful Rezan found his way safely to Canada, and am honoured to have him share his immense skills in the making of The Triple Goddess Pant.</p>
<p>     As a solo mother of two children living in rural Nova Scotia, the years of parenting babies have taken their toll on every aspect of my resources. That is why this Indiegogo Campaign is so important. The capital raised over the next 21 days will raise the much needed funds required to buy organic fabric and supplies, as well as pay Rezan to manufacture the pants.  Your much appreciated contribution to the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT campaign is amazing because it will support many wonderful things including industry in rural Nova Scotia, organic agriculture, a mother-in-business, as well as a refugee urgently in need of stable employment during his time of resettlement in a foreign country. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Triple Goddess Pant is a super stylish and comfortable wide legged pant ethically made from an Organic Cotton/Lycra Blend French terry in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia Canada. </p>
<p>     The pants feature a fold over waistband that moves and stretches when you do, no matter what time of the month, or phase of life you're in. Let's face it, women expand and contract as quickly as the phases of the moon, and these pants will fit you no matter what (and that includes during pregnancy). It's time to get smart ladies and prioritize comfort when it comes to your wardrobe - and I am happy to announce you don't have to sacrifice fashion while you're at it. They are the perfect basic pant that works when you're out on the town, or down dogging it in the yoga studio. Layer it up, dress it up, dress it down - heck you can even sleep in them. The ONLY pant you'll ever need.​</p>

<p>     The TRIPLE GODDESS PANT is made from an Organic Cotton/Lycra blended French Terry fabric. French Terry is known for its luxurious texture which is soft and comfortable against the skin. The  addition of lycra provides an elegant drape and fluidity to the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT, as well as a lovely resilience.</p>

<h3>CARE OF YOUR PANTS: </h3>
<p>Minimal shrinkage in length will occur with the first washing and then it remains stable after that. The TRIPLE GODDESS PANT will last longer if you  keep it out of a dryer, so tumble dry on low only when necessary ~ or even better hang them out on the line to dry!</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT MY BUSINESS PRACTICES</strong></h3>
<p><strong>ORGANIC COTTON</strong></p>
<p>     What makes organic cotton so much better than the conventional ones? Organic cotton is grown in a way that uses methods and materials that lessen the impact on our environment. A big effort in the organic movement is to use growing systems that replenish and maintain soil fertility and build biologically diverse agriculture. Organic cotton uses far less water too. </p>
<p>The main benefit of organic materials, however, is that the crops aren’t treated with pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and Genetically Modified Organisms. These toxins are harmful for farmers and workers, us as consumers, and entire wildlife eco-systems. </p>
<p>     Conventionally grown cotton uses more insecticides than any other crop in the world. It is estimated that each year cotton producers use as much as 25 percent of the world’s insecticides and more than 10 percent of the world’s pesticides; an incredible amount for one just one crop.</p>
<p>     I am committed to organic cotton to minimize my impact on the environment and improve the conditions and quality of life for the people who make my clothing. I believe organic cotton is the foundation for addressing labor and environmental challenges that surround clothing. </p>
<p><strong>SWEAT SHOP FREE</strong></p>
<p>     It’s no secret that sweatshop labor is behind much of the clothing sold today. The media and nonprofits on the ground overseas report on factory bosses paying starvation wages, forcing employees to work unpaid overtime, denying bathroom breaks and sick leave, and retaliating against workers who seek better treatment. Such practices may lead to cheap clothing on the consumer end, but more shoppers are saying that they don’t want low prices to come at the expense of workers. I am proud that the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT is ethically made in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia Canada.</p>

<h2><strong>MY TRACK RECORD OF BUSINESS SUCCESS</strong></h2>
<p>     In 2002 I moved from Toronto to Nova Scotia where I started a handmade natural cosmetics business called Anointment Natural Skin Care. Every Saturday I set up shop and sold my handmade soaps, ointments and other cosmetics at the Halifax Farmer's Market, as well as established numerous wholesale accounts at retail locations across Canada. Over the years customers came to love and trust the Anointment brand and products. Six years later after the birth of my first child I sold Anointment, and it has flourished and remains a reputable and recognized quality product available all over North America. This business success makes me an experienced and professional person you can trust with your investment.</p>

The amazing thing is, the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT accommodates a woman's needs no matter what phase of life she's in too.The fold over organic cotton/lycra waistband expands and contracts to meet the needs of active teenagers, mothers-to-be, and wise crones. 
     Once the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT idea was born, I found the perfect person to manufacture them.

     Reza Iso is a Syrian refugee who recently moved to Nova Scotia with his family to escape the civil war that created the worst humanitarian crisis of our time. Half the country’s pre-war population — more than 11 million people — have been killed or forced to flee their homes. I am grateful Rezan found his way safely to Canada, and am honoured to have him share his immense skills in the making of The Triple Goddess Pant.
     As a solo mother of two children living in rural Nova Scotia, the years of parenting babies have taken their toll on every aspect of my resources. That is why this Indiegogo Campaign is so important. The capital raised over the next 21 days will raise the much needed funds required to buy organic fabric and supplies, as well as pay Rezan to manufacture the pants.  Your much appreciated contribution to the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT campaign is amazing because it will support many wonderful things including industry in rural Nova Scotia, organic agriculture, a mother-in-business, as well as a refugee urgently in need of stable employment during his time of resettlement in a foreign country. 
THE TRIPLE GODDESS PANT

The Triple Goddess Pant is a super stylish and comfortable wide legged pant ethically made from an Organic Cotton/Lycra Blend French terry in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia Canada. 
     The pants feature a fold over waistband that moves and stretches when you do, no matter what time of the month, or phase of life you're in. Let's face it, women expand and contract as quickly as the phases of the moon, and these pants will fit you no matter what (and that includes during pregnancy). It's time to get smart ladies and prioritize comfort when it comes to your wardrobe - and I am happy to announce you don't have to sacrifice fashion while you're at it. They are the perfect basic pant that works when you're out on the town, or down dogging it in the yoga studio. Layer it up, dress it up, dress it down - heck you can even sleep in them. The ONLY pant you'll ever need.​

ABOUT THE FABRIC

     The TRIPLE GODDESS PANT is made from an Organic Cotton/Lycra blended French Terry fabric. French Terry is known for its luxurious texture which is soft and comfortable against the skin. The  addition of lycra provides an elegant drape and fluidity to the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT, as well as a lovely resilience.

CARE OF YOUR PANTS: 
Minimal shrinkage in length will occur with the first washing and then it remains stable after that. The TRIPLE GODDESS PANT will last longer if you  keep it out of a dryer, so tumble dry on low only when necessary ~ or even better hang them out on the line to dry!

ABOUT MY BUSINESS PRACTICES
ORGANIC COTTON
     What makes organic cotton so much better than the conventional ones? Organic cotton is grown in a way that uses methods and materials that lessen the impact on our environment. A big effort in the organic movement is to use growing systems that replenish and maintain soil fertility and build biologically diverse agriculture. Organic cotton uses far less water too. 
The main benefit of organic materials, however, is that the crops aren’t treated with pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and Genetically Modified Organisms. These toxins are harmful for farmers and workers, us as consumers, and entire wildlife eco-systems. 
     Conventionally grown cotton uses more insecticides than any other crop in the world. It is estimated that each year cotton producers use as much as 25 percent of the world’s insecticides and more than 10 percent of the world’s pesticides; an incredible amount for one just one crop.
     I am committed to organic cotton to minimize my impact on the environment and improve the conditions and quality of life for the people who make my clothing. I believe organic cotton is the foundation for addressing labor and environmental challenges that surround clothing. 
SWEAT SHOP FREE
     It’s no secret that sweatshop labor is behind much of the clothing sold today. The media and nonprofits on the ground overseas report on factory bosses paying starvation wages, forcing employees to work unpaid overtime, denying bathroom breaks and sick leave, and retaliating against workers who seek better treatment. Such practices may lead to cheap clothing on the consumer end, but more shoppers are saying that they don’t want low prices to come at the expense of workers. I am proud that the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT is ethically made in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia Canada.

​​

MY TRACK RECORD OF BUSINESS SUCCESS
     In 2002 I moved from Toronto to Nova Scotia where I started a handmade natural cosmetics business called Anointment Natural Skin Care. Every Saturday I set up shop and sold my handmade soaps, ointments and other cosmetics at the Halifax Farmer's Market, as well as established numerous wholesale accounts at retail locations across Canada. Over the years customers came to love and trust the Anointment brand and products. Six years later after the birth of my first child I sold Anointment, and it has flourished and remains a reputable and recognized quality product available all over North America. This business success makes me an experienced and professional person you can trust with your investment.

S T R E T C H GOALS
     Stretch goals are a way for us to add additional colour options as we get more funding. A stretch goal is a funding target set beyond our original Kickstarter goal of $15,000. Once we hit a stretch goal, a new colour will be added to the product selection and become available to our backers. 
     You can help us meet our stretch goals by spreading the word about the TRIPLE GODDESS PANT! Tell your friends, share online, and more! You are also welcome to increase your pledge in order to help us meet a stretch goal.

It all started in winter 2014, we crafted a wallet for a friend  by keeping his requirements in mind and he was amazed in every aspect either  its design or a quality or a purpose. So, our research starts from his motivation.  And as we are design freak and technology lover, we thought to create something  what is missing. Finally, we came up with something sleek and simple because we  know one thing, simplicity is the soul of good design.

Perks

Our Leathers













We use cowhide premium grade leather  in our products, sourced from Turkey. Turkish hides are known for quality,  strength, character and grain. By this way, we can achieve a product of  extremely high quality.  
      Turkey has a strong tradition of  processing leather which comes from its historical past. In the means of this  tradition, today, Turkey is one of the most assertive countries in producing  high quality leather products in the world.






What Next














We’re a startup company with limited  fund but empowered by a bold mindset, we dream to change things for the better  and leave a mark on the world, so we set our goals.
If we achieve more than $20,000 funds, to cheer up with you we decided to give you a choice to upgrade it with Top Grain and Bridge leather which is the best  leather in the industry and use by most of the celebrity brands. (Because we’ll  buy it in Bulk, sourced directly from a Tannery), we also planned for gold and rose gold metal tags.
We need your support to cover our limitation of  funds. You are our only marketing hands, so please do share on social media,  and to your family and friends, so that we can achieve our goal and give you  amazing, something most amazing products.









About us








It all started with only 2 persons, we are the  makers with an ambition to do meaningful work. We believe, with positive  thinking and hard work, we can do anything. Being able to craft something with  meaning and a purpose, pushes us to design and create. We are challenging the  limitation of technology and innovation to create unique designs.








 Risk  and challenges


As we have completed our research and  development stage, as well as small production stage, so we very well mitigated  most of the risk and challenges. 


For a startup company, on mass production  it is quite difficult to find reliable and quality hide suppliers and on time. To  minimize these risks, we have been negotiating with suppliers and backup  suppliers.


When products are handcrafted with extreme  care and attention, so there is a chance of slightly delays in production.


We are very confident about our quality of  the leather and about the quality of the other materials we use and as our each  product are handcrafted with a proper attention, so we promise we won’t send  you a product with any problem.

After the Golden Age, we may saw the design of modern watches lose their direction. In order to recall the wonderful memory of the golden age, we present our first wrist watch collection: ‘courage’.     As we called our collection ‘courage’, we to have the courage to modify the movement. We selected one of the best manual winding movement from one of the most famous watchmaking firm in China and infused it with effort. We added one jewel bearing to the movement to 19 jewels in order to reduce the worn. Then we named this beautifully redesigned 3/4 plate movement to ‘Z19.01’. The power reserve is longer than 42 hours.     After a 4-position adjustment, we also work with our partner to conduct a severe in-shop test. According to our test, our engineering samples reached an extraordinary result on the timegrapher, with rates +3~7 seconds per day and beat error 0.0~0.2 msec considering positional variation. All of the engraving parts are from our master engraver. All the engravings is the labor of hundreds of work hours. Every piece has its own pattern, and every piece is unique. Since then the movement is no longer a mechanical device, it’s more like a piece of art.  Except the movement, we prepared the full-engraving watch dial and a gold inlay version as extra bonus perks for those enthusiasts with deeper pockets.  We do respect the preference of our customers, you can choose the style of the font (Arabic numerals or Roman numerals).Independent serial number will be engraved on the dial. Design draft and sample parts as follows (Pictures for demonstration purpose only, final product may differ from the pictures):   The collection is named as Courage. Who dares, wins; we totally agree. We also believe in finishing and decoration, for most watch manufacturers, they just use mass-produced movements with no improvement. We believe that we can do more, like Côtes de Genève, beveling and polishing on the plate, engraving on the movement, etc. we dare to improve and decorate the original movement.  Besides, we curve the number of jewels, number of adjustments and identical serial number on the movement. For each owner, your watch is unique. Why manual? Even the automatic winding watches are the mainstream, but lots of enthusiasts would like to ‘communicate’ with their watch by winding it up. Moreover, if you ‘keep in touch’ with your watch, a hand-winding watch can reach better accuracy than automatic.  Besides, without the rotor we can see the beauty of movement as well as the magnificent engravings on it, and that we believe to be meaningful. That’s why we choose the manual winding movement. The design of the watch dial is inspired by 70s vintage wrist watches and some antique pocket watches. This is fully expressed on the design of our dial. The only difference with a genuine vintage watch is we tried to increase the diameter of the watch's crystal to make the watch have a bit more modern value. We carefully chose four colors for the Courage collection. We chose alpha style hands on all of our watches, which is widely used by famous luxury watch brands.  After we reach the target of crowd funding, we’ll release the ocean blue on the perks.  The case of the watch is just like the shell of the snail, it protects the sophisticated movement. We choose the 316L stainless steel as our case material. Each watch case is carefully polished by hand and electroplated with multiple layers.  Instead of weak plastic parts, a metal spacer ring is installed in the case in order to provide a solid foundation for the movement. We choose the sapphire crystal as our watch glass, as well as exhibition display back. And the glasses are domed in order to reduce the influence of the strong sunlight and make time-reading much easier. ‘Have you ever seen a crocodile being slayed?’ Unfortunately, we did.We are brave, but not bold. Using crocodile leather is against our moral standard and code of ethics. In this case, the best choice for both consumer and us will be the cowhide. Protecting endangered wildlife and reducing slaughter is our obligation, we can start from now.  Fine polished 316L stainless steel traditional pin buckle will be fitted on our watches, butterfly buckle (Pictures shown) perk can be selected.  An excellent engraved and decorated movement deserves to be peered carefully. So we also bespoke our unique wooden eye loupe for the hand engraving watches. Wooden eye loupe, most belong to those extremely high-end watch manufacturers, now available for most of our consumers. So please enjoy the time with our ticking movement!  A nice watch also deserves a better case, we provide the matt wooden case for all the Courage collection wrist watches. Within the case, a pair of gloves and cleaning cloth will be shipped together to our consumers.Within the case, a founder-stamped Certificate of Authenticity will be issued with all of our watches, every watch has its unique identity.  Watch case: Stainless steel (grade 316L) Polished & Brushed FinishGlass: Domed Sapphire front and backCase Size: 40 mm diameter / 9.7 mm thicknessCrown: screw Style Push Crown with Double O ring  Strap: 20mm Width, High quality genuine leather strapBuckle: traditional pin type, butterfly buckle for optionMovement: Hand-winding Z19.01Water resistant: 5 ATM / 50 meters We believe in the best product can only manufactured by the best team.

<h2>Hi! </h2>
<p>Welcome to my campaign, I have designed the world’s first Cyrillic Slavic wristwatch. </p>
<p>""The Cyrillic numerals are a numeral system derived from the Cyrillic script, developed in the First Bulgarian Empire in the late tenth century. It was used by the First Bulgarian Empire and by South and East Slavic peoples."" </p>

Some say graveyards of broken dreams, we say untapped creative

We want to create a

The crowd will be the judge of their creation through their pledges while we
will take care of the fabrication and logistics. All designers have to do is to
stick to what they do best - design.

We need answer to the

And hence, The Camilla Dress project



Xiu works a 9 to 5 desk-bound job but deep in her heart, she has always wanted to be a designer and explore the creative side of herself. She has no formal training in fashion design but always have had an eye for art and fashion (the same profile of people we hope to help).

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Total protection from UVA/UVB radiation</h3>
<p>Sunlight consists of two types of harmful radiation: UVA and UVB. The UVA penetrates deep in the skin and is the main cause of <i>premature aging of the skin and eyes</i>. UVB is mostly responsible for <i>sunburns</i>.</p>
<p>The overexposure to the sun can cause serious damage to your eyes, such us cataract and macular degeneration. So we all need to protect ourselves as best as possible. </p>
<p>LEONARDO is the eyewear that does exactly that! It <strong>protects you by blocking both UVA and UVB at 100%</strong>, ensuring that your eyes are as safe as possible, no matter where life takes you.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The highest protection from the Blue/Purple spectrum</h3>
<p>Leonardo lenses are <strong>photochromic</strong>, which means that they change color according to the conditions, both outside or inside.</p>
<p>When used outside, they darken <strong>up to 100%</strong> to completely protect you from the UVA and UVB rays and from the blue light emitted from the sun.</p>
<p>Inside, due to the technology within the lens, they turn white and they protect you from <strong>the blue light emitted from computers mobile phones and tablets</strong>, thus reducing eye strain and headaches that you might have from working many hours in front of a screen! </p>

<p>In the video above, you see the techniques used to make and design the leather goods, and a prototype for a new iPhone wallet, hopefully coming soon, with your help ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After more than 13 years of working in graphic design, I decided it was time for a change, and decided to be a shoe maker, spent more than a year learning the craft until I saw the need to go back to graphic design due to the lack of income and my wedding coming up. Now with limited time still needed to make leather goods, the first thing I made is the wallet I use today, made out from one piece of leather and almost no stitching.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517952458/rzubvopzgbq9inkk51ji.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The first SIMPLE wallet!</i></p>
<p>Fast forward some months, (got married) and, was getting my first orders from friends and family. So I decided to give it my full attention and quit, once again, my graphic design (secure, good-paying) job and risk it all, to make leather goods, and with the help of some friends got SIMPLE leather goods off the ground, but there is still so much to do, so here we are, asking for your help to bring Simple leather goods out of Guatemala and into your hands.</p>
<p>I'm working with a small artisan team who keep using traditional methods of craftsmanship, paying them fair wages, and together aim to bring you the best in top quality leather goods, suitable for students, travelers, businessmen, etc. at affordable prices.</p>

</div></div>","In the video above, you see the techniques used to make and design the leather goods, and a prototype for a new iPhone wallet, hopefully coming soon, with your help ;)
 
Short Summary
After more than 13 years of working in graphic design, I decided it was time for a change, and decided to be a shoe maker, spent more than a year learning the craft until I saw the need to go back to graphic design due to the lack of income and my wedding coming up. Now with limited time still needed to make leather goods, the first thing I made is the wallet I use today, made out from one piece of leather and almost no stitching.

The first SIMPLE wallet!
Fast forward some months, (got married) and, was getting my first orders from friends and family. So I decided to give it my full attention and quit, once again, my graphic design (secure, good-paying) job and risk it all, to make leather goods, and with the help of some friends got SIMPLE leather goods off the ground, but there is still so much to do, so here we are, asking for your help to bring Simple leather goods out of Guatemala and into your hands.
I'm working with a small artisan team who keep using traditional methods of craftsmanship, paying them fair wages, and together aim to bring you the best in top quality leather goods, suitable for students, travelers, businessmen, etc. at affordable prices.

Our designs, production and shipping plans are finalized and are ready to go into action the moment our project is successful. And plan to keep working on new products as well.
 

I'm asking for $5,000, first to build the website, second, expand the catalog, and finally buy a small CNC machine, that will allow me to make my own custom-made metal fittings--------------------------------

The Impact
Your contribution will allow me to keep growing and get more jobs for the community, I believe in paying fair trade wages to those who help me and work with me, so they can have a steady income, provide to their families, and help grow the leather craft in Guatemala.

<h2>The Space Colony</h2>
<p>I run a small wearable art studio that dedicates time and effort on doing amazing stuff so people can identify and make they outfit one in a kind. We are honoring the word limited edition, doing only 50 editions of pins and distributing them worldwide, making you the owner of a real limited edition design. </p>
<h3>Why Crowdfunding?:</h3>
<p>I'm an independent artist that want to expand the brand ""The Space Colony"" not only for spreading my designs and colonizing human spaces all around the world but to motivate young entrepreneurs to dream and make their dreams come true, that's the core of my social media strategy, making people have the desire of keeping their maximum effort on all the tings they do, I want them to be different to get inspired and to keep dreaming.</p>
<p>Once I thought I will never get the chance to get my designs to the public view that phase is now completed but now I need the help of all the people I could get so my dream doesn't stop here in just phase one @thespacecolony so I worked on a new set of collectives and hope you can help me get them done!</p>

We aren’t just creating a product but a brand which the consumers are able to connect with one another through a unique family orientated social community. We care about our consumers and we want everybody to share their adventures with our team for us to share online. We noticed that local and international bracelet companies were all made from cheap materials, had predictable, uncreative designs and had a weak relationship between product and brand. We wanted to create a luxury but affordable jewellery piece which represents our love for exploring new places and meeting new people across the globe. The reason we choose a palm tree as the anchor links was because palm trees radiate happiness and we believe featuring a palm instead of an anchor will drive a joyful image into the customers mind every time they glance down at their wrist. Our aim is to create a product that integrates people from all nationalities, religions and ethics. We believe the palm is an international symbol which can bring customers together into a collective network.By wearing the palm band, this showcases the same positive attitude towards life which our community share. The palm is the icon for all things that truly matter in life. Beauty, love, creativity, joy and inner peace. We can't argue our story begins on the shores of Bali,Indonesia.

<h2>Experience positivity</h2>
<p>Cheerings are <strong>intelligent earrings </strong>connected to a <strong>mobile social media app</strong>, where you send voice messages to people you know and love. They <strong>integrate fashion and technology</strong> to create an <strong>experience of positivity</strong> for adolescents. More than simply looking stylish, Cheerings allow the user to receive positive messages from their biggest cheerleaders, such as friends and family.</p>
<p>Behind Cheerings is a team of young people working to bring change to the status quo of their own generation with social media. <strong>19-year-old co-founders George and Leticia</strong> witnessed first-hand the negative impacts of social media on their closest friends and felt the urgency to do something to protect the mental health of young people around the globe. As aspiring engineers, George and Leticia decided to leverage technology to solve the problem that technology/social media itself created. </p>
<p>A pledge means supporting a cause that will impact an entire generation of teenagers. Please <strong>check out our video</strong> above and consider sponsoring our journey!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538710600/vukso23rpeqo8ejyj0fw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Co-founders George and Leticia first met at a summer course at the <strong>University of Pennsylvania, the Management and Technology Summer Institute </strong>(M&amp;TSI). There, the two, plus three other students, envisioned Cheerings and developed a business plan for the idea. From then to now, George and Leticia have worked tirelessly to bring Cheerings into fruition.</p>
<p>George plans to study Management and Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania's M&amp;T program. Leticia plans to study Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science at Harvard University. </p>

<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>The Cheerings experience is composed by a<strong> pair of smart earrings </strong>(including charger) alongside the Cheerings <strong>mobile app</strong>.  Through the app, you record, send and receive voice messages with words of encouragement or positivity, which are played at the tap of your earrings. </p>
<p>The technology behind Cheerings is being carefully crafted so that the message is only audible for the user, ensuring privacy in your communication. </p>

<h2>The Specifics</h2>
<p>Cheerings are<strong> intelligent earrings</strong> that connect to your smartphone via <strong>Bluetooth</strong>. On your smartphone through the Cheerings app, users can send and receive Cheerings messages. To ensure the positivity of the platform, Cheerings implements an <strong>artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm </strong>to filter out potentially offensive or insulting messages. Beyond the social media features around encouraging messages, the earrings themselves contain <strong>fitness tracking functionalities</strong> which will help provide the user with insights into their mental health. </p>

<p>The most recognizable sunglasses design today, and probably throughout history of eyewear, is the classic wayfarer model. Even though the design has been through some over time, the original design lives strong, and will probably always be somewhat similar to what it once was.

<h2>Next generation lenses</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>The lenses might just be the most important part of a pair of sunglasses. And what good would they do if they didn't match the high quality of the titanium frames? We have worked with our best factory to get these lenses to match the <strong>perfectly designed titanium frames.</strong></p>

This means that they block all wavelengths of light from 400 nm, which covers all of the UV spectrum. The first and last layer features a clear and durable scratch-resistant layer to avoid any damage you expose them to.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Titanium metal is the top material of choice in the aerospace industry due to its high strength-to-weight ratio. As it also owns extreme temperature and corrosion resistance, we used this material before and know it will last the test of time.</p>

<p>And we only want the best for our Titan series. Since we make the frame in Titanium we also wanted our springs to be 100% titanium and OBE is the best at what they do.</p> <h2>Protective coating</h2>
<p>Ion plating is a PVD process that uses reactive electron beam evaporation – calling on titanium which is vaporized through heating the alloy to over 2,000 °C. During this process, a titanium nitride layer is added to the stainless steel component. The ionized titanium is then bonded using pressure to form the surface coating.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Using magnets, ion plating is carried out in a vacuum environment. As part of the process the plating metal is added (for example to produce a rose gold color), normally not exceeding 0.3 urn in thickness. At extremely low pressure metal will vaporize. It then become electric ions when heated and bombarded by electrons, known also as plasma. The strengthening technique will build up a super surface hardness.</p>
<p>The greatest bonus of this process is that the titanium nitride produced is both harder and chemically more stable than that produced through traditional plating methods.</p>

 After all the changes the collection have gone through, we are now very happy with the new models and are super excited to present the new series of TITAN.

Both the demand worldwide for masks as well as raw material prices continue to soar, and they don't look like they'll fall anytime soon. But here comes Summer.</p><p><u>Our <strong>""We Make Mask Kit""</strong> has been improved thanks to the feedback we got from our Backers; now it's a ""Feasible &amp; Usable Solution"" for all these conditions.</u></p><p>""We Make Mask Kit"" has been upgraded as <strong>""life wear"" for the Summer Season</strong> via the following six improvements. </p><p> </p><p> </p><div>
<h2>2. 6 Upgrades</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>We upgraded to life wear for many people who have to wear masks during the Summer Season (like the Iron Man Suit “Mark” series).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588909745/rvjwyxjga2pm0etvrinx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1) I feel more comfortable breathing.</strong><br/>The Summer Season requires a wider breathing space as hot air and sweat can fill the mask.<br/>We have increased the breathing space by up to 100% compared to the previous filter-replacement silicon mask and cotton mask.<br/>It's also designed to spread your breathing from side to side, allowing you to breathe more comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>2) Even if I sweat, it’s manageable.</strong><br/>No mask can keep you from sweating during the Summer Season.<br/>However, this mask dries quickly without sticking to the skin using a well-ventilated, breathable Converse-like material. If you give it a 30-second refresh period after wearing it for an hour, you can wear the mask again comfortably.</p>
<p><strong>3) It's lighter.</strong><br/>The design has been changed so that the side clips increase the grip with your face, giving weight to both the side of your face and ear.

</div></div>","1. Introduction  It's now been a month since we started the ""We Make Mask"" campaign. Both the demand worldwide for masks as well as raw material prices continue to soar, and they don't look like they'll fall anytime soon. But here comes Summer.Our ""We Make Mask Kit"" has been improved thanks to the feedback we got from our Backers; now it's a ""Feasible & Usable Solution"" for all these conditions.""We Make Mask Kit"" has been upgraded as ""life wear"" for the Summer Season via the following six improvements.   
2. 6 Upgrades
 
We upgraded to life wear for many people who have to wear masks during the Summer Season (like the Iron Man Suit “Mark” series).
 

 
1) I feel more comfortable breathing.The Summer Season requires a wider breathing space as hot air and sweat can fill the mask.We have increased the breathing space by up to 100% compared to the previous filter-replacement silicon mask and cotton mask.It's also designed to spread your breathing from side to side, allowing you to breathe more comfortably.
2) Even if I sweat, it’s manageable.No mask can keep you from sweating during the Summer Season.However, this mask dries quickly without sticking to the skin using a well-ventilated, breathable Converse-like material. If you give it a 30-second refresh period after wearing it for an hour, you can wear the mask again comfortably.
3) It's lighter.The design has been changed so that the side clips increase the grip with your face, giving weight to both the side of your face and ear. The filter-replaceable mask weighs as little as a nominal medical mask, and when worn, effectively reduces the weight and pressure transmitted to your ear.
4) The filter releases moisture.The three-layer filter is designed to absorb and drain moisture inside the mask. It helps in creating a more comfortable experience and dries faster than conventional filters.
5) Sealing has been improved.Areas in the top & bottom zone, where the mask filter may not cover, now produces a safer seal thanks to a silicone cover treatment.
6) Wash and use it again tomorrow.Made with a highly stain-resistant and fast drying material, the mask can be reused immediately after simply hand washing it and then drying with a hair dryer for 1-2 minutes.

<h3><strong>Company background</strong></h3>
<p>Following on from the BÖRJA collection launched in 2017, ALLISDONE design studio presents the second collection of LAGOM Watches – Sjö.</p>
<p>Our co-founder Daniel grew up in Stockholm and moved to Hong Kong 8 years ago. This relocation from Sweden to Hong Kong, taught him the importance of living a balanced, fuss-free life so he decided to spread this philosophy to the world, and created LAGOM Watches.</p>
<h3>Brand Introduction</h3>
<p>“LAGOM” has long been a vital deeply-rooted aspect of Scandinavian culture - the Swedish concept of “not too much, not too little.” That which is enough, sufficient, satisfactory. Just right.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858190/gyk2mnq9uvntmfxp5aoa.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In each collection of LAGOM Watches, there are two important elements - the stainless steel case and an unique acetate ring. Its simple yet aesthetic design evokes the Swedish philosophy of moderation.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858218/faxm6dxovxibc0bt0sih.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858243/pwubzrfxbobdtxiibqzt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858263/hsk1yayxhxbiqzablyfa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>Sjö means lake or small sea in Swedish, a country blessed with 11,500 km of coastline and around 100,000 lakes. Its capital, the city of Stockholm, is situated on fourteen islands of an archipelago where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858294/oghdb3nng9ccfero58q2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Daniel, our co-founder, was mostly raised by his grandfather who worked in the shipbuilding industry in Sweden. Unsurprisingly, he spent lots of time sailing around with his grandfather when he was a child, and this is where he fell in love with the ocean and the vessels who sail on it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858311/iwxxmufypnzxuaxsqceo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Having similar geographical features, Hong Kong naturally reminded Daniel of home. Victoria Harbour, situated between Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula, bustles day and night with all manner of watercraft; from the historic Star Ferries to cruise liners, cargo ships, and wooden fishing vessels. Thus, Daniel was inspired to have two different dial designs in the Sjö collection. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858330/kyz7gga5qh8p4i14a1qs.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This choice was also inspired by the Vasamuseet, the maritime museum in Stockholm, which showcases salvaged ships from history. Ships are the main transport of the ocean, yet it is the sailing control panel that has the most importance for sailing on the tremendous empty oceans. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858347/sn8qenci96xj6cndmmha.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A ship’s control panel serves as the design inspiration for one of the dial designs in the SJÖ collection (LW029 to LW036).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858362/t793h7zuj09cxqqcm7a6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In addition, the blue acetate symbolizes the ocean, and the unique pattern on the acetate pieces imitates the waves of the sea. They can be calm but quickly become raging; just like the ups and downs of our everyday live. The uniqueness of each acetate furthermore tells our own individual story.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572858379/ybmjptxx8sfp7wvngvsa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The stainless steel case highlights the lion rock spirit of Hong Kong, the core values passed by Hong Kongers from generation to generation. This spirit enablesd the people of Hong Kong to evolve from fishing villages into the dynamic global financial hub it is today. But in return, the people lead a fast-paced city life. Hence, we would like to add some ""lagom"" into people's everyday lives, so we can all slow down and discover the beauty of life. The combination of the stainless-steel case and acetate ring symbolises the harmony in diversity.</p>
<p>Daniel grew up in a traditional Swedish family and no matter how busy the family members were, they spent lots of time together. But in Hong Kong, Daniel was separated from his family and he found himself alone. To remind himself of all those precious moments, he gave the watch the bolded strokes on the 5-10-hour marks, representing 17:00 to 22:00 in the evening.</p>

<h3><strong>Material &amp; Craftsmanship</strong></h3>
<p>We have sourced the acetate from Mazzucchelli 1849, an Italian company that has existed for centuries. They supply acetate of the best quality and in the finest traditions.</p>
<p>Every acetate piece is laser cut and polished by experienced watchmakers. We cannot guarantee the acetate pattern is the same on every watch, but we like this uniqueness.</p>

</div></div>","Company background
Following on from the BÖRJA collection launched in 2017, ALLISDONE design studio presents the second collection of LAGOM Watches – Sjö.
Our co-founder Daniel grew up in Stockholm and moved to Hong Kong 8 years ago. This relocation from Sweden to Hong Kong, taught him the importance of living a balanced, fuss-free life so he decided to spread this philosophy to the world, and created LAGOM Watches.
Brand Introduction
“LAGOM” has long been a vital deeply-rooted aspect of Scandinavian culture - the Swedish concept of “not too much, not too little.” That which is enough, sufficient, satisfactory. Just right.

 
 
 
 
 
 
In each collection of LAGOM Watches, there are two important elements - the stainless steel case and an unique acetate ring. Its simple yet aesthetic design evokes the Swedish philosophy of moderation.



Inspiration
Sjö means lake or small sea in Swedish, a country blessed with 11,500 km of coastline and around 100,000 lakes. Its capital, the city of Stockholm, is situated on fourteen islands of an archipelago where Lake Mälaren meets the Baltic Sea.

Daniel, our co-founder, was mostly raised by his grandfather who worked in the shipbuilding industry in Sweden. Unsurprisingly, he spent lots of time sailing around with his grandfather when he was a child, and this is where he fell in love with the ocean and the vessels who sail on it.

Having similar geographical features, Hong Kong naturally reminded Daniel of home. Victoria Harbour, situated between Hong Kong Island and the Kowloon Peninsula, bustles day and night with all manner of watercraft; from the historic Star Ferries to cruise liners, cargo ships, and wooden fishing vessels. Thus, Daniel was inspired to have two different dial designs in the Sjö collection. 

This choice was also inspired by the Vasamuseet, the maritime museum in Stockholm, which showcases salvaged ships from history. Ships are the main transport of the ocean, yet it is the sailing control panel that has the most importance for sailing on the tremendous empty oceans. 

A ship’s control panel serves as the design inspiration for one of the dial designs in the SJÖ collection (LW029 to LW036).

In addition, the blue acetate symbolizes the ocean, and the unique pattern on the acetate pieces imitates the waves of the sea. They can be calm but quickly become raging; just like the ups and downs of our everyday live. The uniqueness of each acetate furthermore tells our own individual story.

The stainless steel case highlights the lion rock spirit of Hong Kong, the core values passed by Hong Kongers from generation to generation. This spirit enablesd the people of Hong Kong to evolve from fishing villages into the dynamic global financial hub it is today. But in return, the people lead a fast-paced city life. Hence, we would like to add some ""lagom"" into people's everyday lives, so we can all slow down and discover the beauty of life. The combination of the stainless-steel case and acetate ring symbolises the harmony in diversity.
Daniel grew up in a traditional Swedish family and no matter how busy the family members were, they spent lots of time together. But in Hong Kong, Daniel was separated from his family and he found himself alone. To remind himself of all those precious moments, he gave the watch the bolded strokes on the 5-10-hour marks, representing 17:00 to 22:00 in the evening.










Material & Craftsmanship
We have sourced the acetate from Mazzucchelli 1849, an Italian company that has existed for centuries. They supply acetate of the best quality and in the finest traditions.
Every acetate piece is laser cut and polished by experienced watchmakers. We cannot guarantee the acetate pattern is the same on every watch, but we like this uniqueness.

The quartz movement is from Swiss Ronda, it comes with battery will last for at least 36 months. 

The premium leather strap is from Italy. It is super soft and sits very well on your wrist.

<p>
</p>
<p>Inspired by print and runway, I chose to start my own
publication! I was born and raised in Detroit; I even went to college in
Detroit. After I graduated, double majoring in Marketing and Fashion
Merchandising, I didn’t know what I wanted to do, regarding fashion. I just
knew I was inspired by print and runway, and I had to have it in my life. </p>
<p>A few years after having a hand in styling, personal
shopping and visual merchandising, I wanted more and knew it would take
something drastic for me to create a tangible vision to my satisfaction. I saw
so many great publications online. So many people went digital and had great
publications. There were even avenues, like MagCloud, where you could do
print-to-order. I decided that would be perfect for me. At that point, I had
magazine collections bigger than living room furniture. I decided I could
create my own magazine while in Michigan. I’ve always been passionate about
magazines. It was time to create my own and do it my way.</p>
<p>I sent out TONS and TONS of e-mails explaining what I wanted
to do. I was really inspired by European publications. I knew I wanted a fun
point of view. I wanted to work with nice people who enjoyed fashion and had
fun with it. I wanted to reach out to readers who find joy in fashion and are
inspired by multiple aesthetics and designers. Fashion makes me happy. I wanted
both reader and contributor to have fun with fashion, so I decided to name the
magazine “PlayHaus.”</p>I really think there's something to be said about men's fashion. Lots of people enjoy more than ""one look"" and love diversity. Men's fashion is exciting, too!<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F111595420&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F111595420&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F496268523_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

and shouldn’t have to. We can all enjoy fashion how we see fit and we are
allowed to have different ideas, styles and aesthetics.</span></p>
<p>There are so many talented designers! We get these amazing
fashion shows with these amazing clothes and it seems like they aren’t being
showcased enough. What’s the point of having awesome Fashion Week collections
and coverage when some magazines go back to the same aesthetic and show the
predictable pieces you could have guess they would focus on?! I believe there
are so many great designers and clothes that don’t get the recognition or
spotlight they deserve. </p>
<p>And these clothes don’t have to be from well-known
designers either. There are so many smaller brands that make awesome clothes.
High or low, well-known or newer, great clothes are great clothes. The fun
thing is mixing and matching for us. We can go to showrooms and use high-end
pieces and mix them with student work. We like to incorporate a good mix. It’s
been great work with so many diverse pieces!</p>

<p>Models are not just hangers. They’re PEOPLE. It’s been great working with Vara Reese along the way (she did all of these videos so be sure to check her out). She’s been sweet and collaborated with us for most of our videos. We were able to interview models and get to know them. I wanted to do interviews with models, which we still do. We got to shoot so many diverse models for our editorials. Not only is promoting their skill as a model important to me, I want people to get to know them as well.</p>
<p>One of the greatest things about shooting and interviewing male models is the brotherhood. We’ve had group shoots before and everyone was extremely nice to each other. So much humility and personality!</p>

    Other Ways You Can Help PlayHaus has gotten some AWESOME support! Realistically, everyone won't be able to donate. BUT, there are other ways YOU can help!
Please share the page if you can!
You can also follow us on Instagram: @playhausmag.com
I strongly believe in PlayHaus and EVERYONE who has worked so hard to make it what it is today. While there are many behind behind-the-scenes expenses we all have incurred, getting PlayHaus to print will require more support.

<p><strong>Hammock Life Clothing</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered how much satisfaction you are getting out of your regular 9-5 job? Is it really what you thought you would be doing once you grew up? Are you really following your passion, slaving for someone else? Is your employer appreciating the remarkable ideas you possess?</p>
<p>Statistics suggest that 52.3% people are unhappy at work, with their usual 9-5 jobs. So what are we really doing with our life, living it in a robotic way? This was the question that pinched my mind one day at work, when I realized that rather than serving my unique passion, I am serving to a corporate structure in a mechanistic way that is profitable to my wellbeing in the least.</p>
<p>Since very young, I wanted to launch my own clothing line. I dreamt of my products inspiring individuals to become bigger and better, helping them find their inner light in the most positive of fashions. Recollecting fragments of my adolescent passion, I decided to open my own company, called Hammock Life Clothing. It is a clothing line that aims to promote good vibes and positive actions. It has always been my dream to be my own boss and not only own my own business but to own a business that has a positive impact on the world. With the advent of Hammock Life clothing (<a href=""http://hammocklifeclothing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://hammocklifeclothing.com/</a>), I want to generate a ripple of positivity and growth, compared to the stagnancy of our usual daily lives.</p>
<p>Since it’s a recent start-up, I am looking for funding to execute my ideas in a wearable form. I request you to pitch in whatever you can to give a formal structure to this start-up. Hammock life has given me a vision and I wish to propagate this vision around the globe. Only you can help me do it!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

 LA IDEAWe all like to express ourselves with our clothes, make clear our personality and identity and dress well.So create this brand goes beyond making nice clothes and fashion, the essence is to bring the gospel and impact the world.-------A todos nos gusta expresarnos con nuestra ropa, dejar clara nuestra personalidad e identidad y vestir bien.Así que crear la marca va más allá de hacer ropa bonita y a la moda, la esencia es llevar el evangelio e impactar el mundo.








TÚ PEDES SER PARTEProject funding is for the production of shirts and accessories, buying supplies and expenses, which we can start a web shop and a time later a physical store. Why not?By contributing with LAMB, we will be grateful for life plus you can get discounts on future purchases of products, t-shirts, accessories and the satisfaction of helping people and institutions that we allocate a percentage of total sales.-------El financiamiento del proyecto es para la producción de camisetas y accesorios, compra de suministros y gastos, con lo cual podamos comenzar una tienda en línea y más adelante una tienda física. ¿Porqué no?Al contribuir con LAMB, además que estaremos agradecidos de por vida, puedes obtener descuentos en futuras compras de productos, camisetas, accesorios y la satisfacción de ayudar a personas e instituciones a las que destinaremos un porcentaje de las ventas totales.







    
IMPACTANDO EL MUNDO
I hope to draw in your mind this example as I imagine:People wearing clothing with images and Bible verses, they call the attention of those around them. And people come to ask what it is about what they wear.This is the time!With our lifestyle we impact others and we aim them to life with Christ, proclaiming the gospel.-------Espero dibujar en tu mente este ejemplo como yo lo imagino:Las personas vistiendo prendas con imágenes y versículos bíblicos, que llaman la atención de los que les rodean. Y la gente se acerquen a preguntarles de qué se trata lo que llevan puesto.¡Este es el momento!Con nuestro estilo de vida impactamos a los demás y los apuntamos a una vida con Cristo, proclamando el evangelio.






 
DESAFÍOSWith our experience in design and printing, we promise to give the best effort in this project.There will be challenges but we know that everything will work for a purpose.-------Con nuestra experiencia en el área de diseño e impresión nos comprometemos a dar el mayor esfuerzo en este proyecto.Van a haber retos pero sabemos que todo saldrá bien conforme a un propósito.

<br/></div>","When the person on the other end grabs their cup, the cup color changes letting you know that you're connected and together.Use Tlinkle to connect with your far away loved ones. ""Even though you're far apart, you'll feel as if you're sharing a cup right next to each other.""Through the associated application, you can change the color of the light and customize it based on whoever is on the other end of the cup allowing you to know at a moment's notice whether it's you loved on, mother, father, etc. Through the app, you can communicate by different means other than the color of the light. You can communicate through text and images through the app as well. 


How many times a day do you think about your significant other and/or family?When you spent most of your day cramped up in the office or out running around, it can be hard to think about or remember the faces of your loved ones. 
Even though you want to, it can be hard to contact parents that may be far away. 

Connect with all those you miss using Tlinkle.
When you're busy at work and you see a twinkle coming from your cup, you'll instantly think of the faces of the ones you love and share Tlinkle with and vice versa.
Tlinkle will always twinkle no matter how close or far your loved ones are. 

Couples can create their own Tlinkle community via the smartphone app and once registered, when one grabs their Tlinkle, the other will be notified by a twinkle on theirs. 
When both grab their Tlinkle's, a pre-selected ""couple"" color will notify you that both of you are grabbing your individual cups.Through the app, bulletin boards, photo albums, calendars can be shared via the community as well. 
Families can also create their own communities and when one member grabs their Tlinkle, the rest of your family will see a twinkle from their Tlinkle. 

If celebrities and their fans register their own community as well, when the celebrity grabs their Tlinkle, world-wide fans will be notified through their cups that their favorite celebrity is enjoying a cup of coffee or tea and they can connect with them as well. 
If a date has been agreed upon, fans can grab their cup letting their celebrity know that you're waiting for them. 

Tlinkle App Registration


Community Creation through the app


Once registered, couples and families must set their account to ""star mode"". This allows bi-lateral twinkle notification through Tlinkle. If not set this way, the uni-lateral function will notify others when the person who has their account set to ""star mode"" (aka a celebrity). 


Tlinkle Time Start – Once you begin, you and those connected in the community can start using Tlinkle.

When one of you grabs your Tlinkle, and the other person does too, a pre-selected color will notify you that both or all parties have grabbed their cup as well. 
Tlinkle App will be available in the Google Play Store.





Tlinkle Cup connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth.
When you grab your Tlinkle, sensors in the cup in combination with your Bluetooth connected application will send notification to the your loved ones. 

* Tlinkle must be connected to your smartphone in order to send twinkles. 

* Currently, Tlinkle is only compatible with Android devices.









Through Tlinkle we want to help people connect with the ones they love even at their busiest times through technology. 
With the support we receive through your pre-orders, the funds will be used to create better molds for our cups as well as safety testing.


Since the cup is still being fine tuned, the final commercial version may differ from the prototype due to changes in parts, materials, etc. Design changes will only help in improving convenience and safety.But don't worry. All progress updates in development will be sent out to our backers. We will do our best to not delay production and development to our backers even if there are changes to parts or materials and we will deliver our product on time. 
Q: How do we select Tlinkle cup type and color?A: Upon successful completion of our campaign, we will send out a survey requesting color and type selection to the email address we have on file.
Q: Does Tlinkle not work with iPhones?A: Unfortunately, the initial models will only be compatible with Android. We expect to begin iOS development in the second half of 2015.Q: Does Tlinkle need to be connected to your smartphone in order to use?A: If you to notify your connected users instantly that you're using your Tlinkle, it must be connected to Bluetooth when using.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a disabled small business owner that is in college, my business is meant to help fund my service dog's training so I can regain my independance. </p>
<p>After starting to get into buying dog accessories for my service dog in training I realized there is not anything cute for dog poop bag holders. A necessary item for any dog owner. Since the dog will accompany me everywhere I need them to be stylish. </p>
<p>I want to add this product to my shop and get them into the hands of other dog parents. I cannot afford the first order without some help. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need about $2,500 to pay for the first order to get the minimum quantity of 500 custom poop bag holders. After much research I found a great manufactorer and got the prototype from them. </p>
<p>Now what you probably are eager to know. There are different tiers to backing this project. You'll revieve Boba Dog merch and can pre order your own Boba Poop Bag Holder by backing this. </p>
<p>If the goal is not reached I'll save the funds to help with this project after I secure more funding. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier I am disabled. I have postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, mast cell activation syndrome, hashimotos, elhers danlos syndrome and IC. I was diagnosed my first year of college and since than had al my plans thrown to the side. </p>
<p>The service dog will give me back my independence that I briefly had, I'll be able to go to college that isn't 20 min from home. </p>
<p> I've been struggling to find where I belong in society and as a small business. I came up with this idea and at first thought it was silly. After further research no one else seemed to be doing it. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>The largest risk is not being able to get this seen by people. This is the largest risk for any project.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It's ok if you can't contribute money to the project. There's plenty you can do! </p>
<p>1) Share this project with your friends and family. The more we spread the word the better chance we have of succeeding. </p>

It is a functional, beautiful and easy to use bag that's meant to bring you more autonomy and comfort. Motora can be manipulated without any strength or fine motor skills, it also adapts perfectly to every wheelchair backrest, and has special compartments to store your day to day items.In its ""S"" version, we have adapted Motora so users without a disability can be benefited of its characteristics.In order to make Motora functional, aesthetic and easy to use we have integrated many components that will allow you to use it with more autonomy and comfort.  Motora integrates a magnetic clasp to open and close it, so you don't have to use strength to manipulate it. Also, it is mixed with a circular string so you can just use  the clasp, closures and many other elements without fine motor skills.To open the magnetic clasp just pull the circular string, and to close it just get both parts of the clasp close enough so the magnets do the job for you. In the search of your safety, we added reflectant properties to the circular strings in the backpack so you can be visible at night. If you don't want this feature just tell us in a survey that we will send to you when the campaign is over! Easy to use, also means easy to grab and lift. Motora includes handles in the front, in the sides and in the top so you can manipulate it as you please.The top handle is adjustable so you can give it the large you want. Also, the side handles can have different texture so you don't confuse them with the straps when you grab them from behind, this is an optional feature and you will be able to tell us your preference in a survey that we will send you at the of the campaign. Motora posses four external pockets, one in the upper part, two in the sides and one in the front.In one of its sides, it has a bottle pocket which integrates elastics and a square string to ease its manipulation. In the other side of the bag, there is an ease access pocket that you can use when the backpack is in the backrest of your wheelchair, you can use it to store frequently used items like wallets and keys,  In the upper part you have a pocket to store common used items that needs fasts access from the front like your technicals aids. And in the front it posses a raincoat compartment so you can store your hygienic stuff and protect the other objects from any liquid leak.Another important element is the bottom cover, that protects your things from potential hits and water splash that the backpack may suffer when moving around in the streets. Can't find a bag where you can store all your objects properly? Motora was designed to store all your everyday objects.It posses an internal pocket so you can store your catheters without bending them.Also a compartment for your computer that has a retraible pull out systems attached to a square string that will ease the take out of your notebook and will go back to its original position once you release it.Additionally, the small pockets inside will allow you to store less frequently used items and its large volume will let you pack away everything you want.As a final plus, the inner of the backpack is waterproof, so it can protect the items that you are carrying from liquid leaks in the outside of the bag.Tired that your backpack hits your backrest all the time? Motora One includes an adjustable straps systems so you can fix them where it suits you more, eliminating the pendulum effect that mosts bags have when you move around with them.Just use the circular string to open it and pull the straps to the level you want, then close the systems and your Motora One will fit perfectly in your backrest. No more pendulum effect,  no more hitting your bag with the floor and no more discomfort with your backpack in your wheelchair.Since I had my accident some years ago, I have looked a lot alternatives to become more autonomous in a world that is not conceived to be accessible. Unfortunately not having many options I was forced to make improvised adaptations or have to ask for help. That`s why l decided to take action on the matter and undertake this challenge as one of many more to come.I met Claudio at college, where we became friends and started to undertake together. Im a passionate entepreneur and a dog lover and together with Claudio we want to make this project come true Motora  is though to fit perfectly to the backrest of your wheelchair and your back in case you want to carry it with you. Here you will find more info about the dimensions of Motora and the development process. We have been working for over two years designing, prototyping and testing with different kinds of users so we can make sure that everyone can use Motora comfortably and with ease.In order to develop Motora, we have been working with the bests workshops in Chile. With the help of our suppliers and designers, we have been able to achieve the best quality for the backpack. To access the press kit please click the image above or enter in this link.For additional questions contact us at: carriazv@gmail.comThe main reason we want to use Indiegogo is to get as much users as we can and build a community, we believe that through this platform we can accelerate the process to benefit as much people as possible. Also, it will help us in the production and logistic process, allowing us to make delivery easier.Motora One and Motora S comes with a 12 month limited warranty for Indiegogo backers. We also ensure that every unit is free from manufacturing defects and handled with the utmost care during shipment. If there is any problem with the sent product, we will send immediately new backpack.If you have additional questions please write us to: carriazv@gmail.comAs we are new to Indiegogo, time will be the most challenging part. Depending on the demand of the product, we may take a little longer to make the delivers.  However, we have started working since before the launch of this campaign to find the bests suppliers to cover the demand. As we are also trying to find new suppliers to cover the whole demand of this campaign, it could take some time to find one that satisfy our quality demands, we prefer to take a little more time to deliver something that is going to please you rather than delivering  something that doesn't fulfill our promise in order to deliver in time. We believe that we can mitigate all potential risks in this journey as we have been working two years in this project and we are well aware of the difficulties that may come in our way. In any circumstance, we will keep informing you and telling in advance the status of the production and delivery.

By week two, we're often set off to fend for ourselves, as freshman or returned students. Sometime after, the up and up turns the opposite way and so do some of us. Hi, my name is Izeem Mcherrin, and I believe students need to be self-sufficient. But how to become self-sufficient? I believe it starts by being self-motivated, and to finish long-term goals; like college. Which historically is not always easy. Why, because there are very bad things in college, such as bullying. Which I'd like to call a ""misunderstanding"".

These are sayings college students hear often, usually during the first few days of class. By week two, we're often set off to fend for ourselves, as freshman or returned students. Sometime after, the up and up turns the opposite way and so do some of us. Hi, my name is Izeem Mcherrin, and I believe students need to be self-sufficient. But how to become self-sufficient? I believe it starts by being self-motivated, and to finish long-term goals; like college. Which historically is not always easy. Why, because there are very bad things in college, such as bullying. Which I'd like to call a ""misunderstanding"". Or even a missed opportunity to work with peers towards mutual successes in college. Who? Is Izeem Mcherrin, Founder (image: SUNY Broome College President, Dr. Drumm and Izeem Mcherrin)Izeem Mcherrin is the founder of the education focused start-up clothing website, called The Forward Never Backward Store -online at www.fnbstuff.com. Also has 2 locations, Upstate New York, at retail.My partners and I first started this company in 2015, out of the need to help motivate other youths to keep moving forward with long-term goals, such as college. As college is extremely important, especially in urban cities. Yearly, we've accomplished many goals in the Binghamton, New York area. Some mentions are having a platform where student's can intern for credits toward their major, and/or work part-time with pay. In 2017 through research we've pinpointed a major cause for college dropouts, not only in our city but state-wide. We'll discuss that shortly. Recently in 2018, on its third year of business, our store has been bought by the largest us college bookstore seller in the United States. The story is just beginning. Now lets begin. What Is The Problem? In New York State, there is confusion between students on various occasions in various areas, prevalent mainly during after off hours in the dormitories. Through interview research, we've quantified that of all the hardest things to do as a student in college, is to defend yourself against other students. Because you're all, well, students. Makes sense. So What Is The Solution?A Great First Impression! 
 A good first impression, is a lasting impression.  Which, when matching an specific environment can stop many types of confusion. We answer the question, ""how to mean business, at college on a college budget?""  Well by first trying our campaign product, Success Material Clothing. I think we may finally have ""a"" solution.Here are some highlights of our clothing product:
Showcases many career aspirations printed on front chest design!
Alleviates confusion by having peers and opportunities become interested in you!
Show inspiration to others, one social-media photos, video and meeting people!
Helps boost self-esteem by expressing ""I Am Success Material"" outright!
Represents the ambitions within yourself toward others!
                               Why Pay For Aide Twice? In a nutshell, we think every student should at a minimum, be knowledgeable of success material. And have a choice to use it for personal and social-aide, and trust us, it works! And also for student's to have available, new helpful programs for everyone, included with tuition. This combination can act as a precaution towards peer confusion, fighting and becoming unmotivated. These good results can prevent dropouts, arrests and sometimes death.""For problems that come along with higher-education institutions, historically"".

We take stored data security to a whole new level! Nobody will ever know what data you are keeping, because your files are not linked to your personal information on our servers. That means total anonymity. All data is encrypted using a 2048-bit key a technology similar to the one used for bank transactions but even better. It all happens on your computer, and even if someone lays hand on your data, they won’t be able to decipher it without a SmartFlash itself. You can use an additional pin-code that is impossible to track if you use a mouse to enter it. Losing your Flashsafe is like losing your bank card: the device is blocked while you get a new one and continue to use it. A ""trusted computer"" function lets you use your SmartFlash only on your devices.



Want to share a song you like with a friend? Or show a presentation to your boss? Add your colleague or a friend to a list of trusted persons and share all the info or a selected folder. It’s that simple.



Flashsafe is a smart device that is upgraded just like your smartphone or PC. Our team is constantly looking for new ways to improve the opportunities provided by Flashsafe, making it comfortable to use, glitch-free and quick to embrace new functionality. In the near future, the following new functions will be introduced:

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<b>SOUL WOOD </b>was born from an idea of two guys with the passion for fashion, with the intention to create a new eco-friendly product.
<div>So we decided to engage us in the eco-friendly fashion industry that combine attention to details, new trends and environmental protection.</div>
<div>One day Manuel was reading an article about ""Start up, sustainability and youth entrepreneurship"". Some minutes later he was calling to London where Diego listened the suggest and he was persuaded. Soul Wood began.</div>
<div>The attention for the environment has become a main component that the new business must include in the creation of all products.</div>

<div>
<div>
<p><b>SOUL WOOD</b> nasce dall’idea di due ragazzi, con la passione per la moda
e la voglia di creare un prodotto fashion ed ecosostenibile.
Dall’unione di queste due spinte abbiamo deciso di impegnarci nel nuovo
campo dell’eco-fashion che racchiude la cura del dettaglio e delle
nuove tendenze e l’attenzione alla salvaguardia dell’ambiente.
</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Un lunedì mattina l'occhio di Manuel cade su una pagina del quotidiano: ""</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Start up,
sostenibilità, imprese giovanili"". La mente inizia a macinare e parte la telefonata in direttissima a Londra, dove un dubbioso Diego che ascolta la proposta concitata
di Manuel e l'idea lo colpisce, può essere vincente. Dall'idea all'impresa il passo è breve: E così inizia
Soul Wood.</span></p>
<p>L’attenzione all’ambiente è diventata una caratteristica che le nuove
aziende devono considerare e soprattutto prendere come punto estremamente centrale ed importante nella creazione dei loro prodotti. </p>

Our Story
SOUL WOOD was born from an idea of two guys with the passion for fashion, with the intention to create a new eco-friendly product.
So we decided to engage us in the eco-friendly fashion industry that combine attention to details, new trends and environmental protection.
One day Manuel was reading an article about ""Start up, sustainability and youth entrepreneurship"". Some minutes later he was calling to London where Diego listened the suggest and he was persuaded. Soul Wood began.
The attention for the environment has become a main component that the new business must include in the creation of all products.
The Campaign

We decided to take up this work on IndieGoGo because with your help we can start production of our ""Season Edition"" Wooden Watch, 100% natural, hypoallergenic with Swiss movement. Thanks to your help we will develop and create a new model.
We believe that through this channel we can reduce the cost of development, production and marketing. We want to offer a great product at a fair price.
Your contribution will help us create a solid startup and to establish an effective partnership with the supply chain.

La Storia





SOUL WOOD nasce dall’idea di due ragazzi, con la passione per la moda
e la voglia di creare un prodotto fashion ed ecosostenibile.
Dall’unione di queste due spinte abbiamo deciso di impegnarci nel nuovo
campo dell’eco-fashion che racchiude la cura del dettaglio e delle
nuove tendenze e l’attenzione alla salvaguardia dell’ambiente.

Un lunedì mattina l'occhio di Manuel cade su una pagina del quotidiano: ""Start up,
sostenibilità, imprese giovanili"". La mente inizia a macinare e parte la telefonata in direttissima a Londra, dove un dubbioso Diego che ascolta la proposta concitata
di Manuel e l'idea lo colpisce, può essere vincente. Dall'idea all'impresa il passo è breve: E così inizia
Soul Wood.
L’attenzione all’ambiente è diventata una caratteristica che le nuove
aziende devono considerare e soprattutto prendere come punto estremamente centrale ed importante nella creazione dei loro prodotti. 



La Campagna
Abbiamo deciso di intraprendere questa impresa su IndieGoGo perchè con il vostro aiuto potremo avviare la produzione dei nostri Orologi in Legno 100% naturale, ipoallergenico con movimento svizzero ""Season Edition"". Inoltre ci aiuterete a sostenere lo sviluppo e la creazione di un nuovo modello.
Crediamo che attraverso questo canale potremo abbattere i costi di sviluppo, realizzazione e marketing per potervi offrire un grande prodotto ad un prezzo equo.
Il vostro contributo ci aiuterà a creare una solida startup e ad instaurare un efficace collaborazione con la filiera produttiva.

Our aim is to pave the way for the new every-day face mask. We are using silver, a natural anti-bacterial agent in the creation of the Silver Shield. Silver helps to eliminate any harsh odours whilst also contributing towards a healthier breathing environment. We wear masks to protect those around us, but our aim was to create a mask that also had anti-bacterial properties.We have infused each mask with nano-silver particles. Nano-silver release’s ions that slow down the growth of bacteria and fungi. As a result, nano-silver kills viruses and bacteria, making it a vital attribute for our future every-day face mask.We use a thin, light, economical high-performance fabric with superior wicking for a cool, dry, and fresh feel. The Silver Shield is engineered for ultimate comfort. The mask is made with extremely breathable, soft, stretchy, and durable fabric which uses premium hydrophobic fibres.The Silver Shield is the answer to everyday mask wear. The infused silver lining helps control bad odours and create a long-lasting freshness without the use of harsh toxic chemicals. Silver Shield is not like your ordinary face mask. If you ever needed more reason to join the Silver Shield family, take a look at some of its fantastic features: Each one of our masks is hand crafted to the utmost quality. We are asking for the help of our future backers today to assist in the mass production of the Silver Shield line so we can supply our anti-bacterial product worldwide.Each mask is also embroidered with high quality thread to give it a sleek exterior. We want to stress the embroidery detail will not deter the effects of the silver infused lining.  We live in a world where face masks have become the “new normal”. As we adjust to new life in the world of a global pandemic our face masks have become our new and most reliable accessory. Whether you are nipping out the shops, working in the public sector or using public transport – wearing your face mask is a necessity.We made it our aim to create a mask that is suitable for everyone, whilst helping fight against bacteria and harsh toxins. With 9 colour variations and two universal sizes there is sure to be a Silver Shield suitable for everyone. A huge motive behind our campaign was to contribute towards a happy, healthier planet. Disposable masks have been hugely damaging to the environment so we made it our aim to ensure we created a durable mask that can be used again and again.But why did we choose silver? Let us explain it’s inspiring benefits: The silver properties we use for our masks are a naturally occurring element. There are no chemicals and no toxicity for the wearer, so you can use your Silver Shield freely, knowing you aren’t at risk of breathing in any harsh toxins. Silver is one of the safest and benign substances known around the world.Disposable masks can be rough on your skin causing breakouts and soreness particularly if you suffer from sensitive skin.The material used to create Silver Shield are non-sensitizing, and non-irritating to human skin.Disposable masks are extremely harmful to the environment. We ensured that the Silver Shield uses eco-friendly material that is reusable so you can wear your mask between washes again and again.Each mask is hand-crafted with durable long-lasting material to ensure you get lots of use out of your mask.Our face mask can be washed at 30°C and uses durable material that stays intact after every wash! As mentioned previously, your Silver Shield is reusable! Not only will your Silver Shield protect you and others around you, but also contributes to a happy, healthier world. What’s not to love? We are pleased to announce we have made Silver Shield in two universal sizes. We have both adult and child size available.

Made of hypoallergenic elastomer, the anti-compression Temple Grips are ultra-light and gentle on ears. These qualities make it comfortable to wear vOOk Freedom for long hours and under headgear.vOOk Freedom frames come with a high-quality build. We work with a very experienced and long-time manufacturer of high-end glasses to produce vOOk Freedom frames that are well-crafted, beautifully finished and stylish.To make vOOk Freedom frames even better, we chose to use a high-tech Swiss polyamide from a world market leading Swiss manufacturer, to bring high-performance stylish eyewear into the everyday lives of users. The high-tech high-performance Swiss polyamide makes our frames durable, impact-resistant, scratch-resistant, high-flex tolerant and ultra-light! It is also more durable and lighter than the other commonly used materials in the market such as acetate and polycarbonate. vOOk Freedom is Suitable for Whom?vOOk Freedom is especially great for active people who do sports/exercise, or with active lifestyles.
